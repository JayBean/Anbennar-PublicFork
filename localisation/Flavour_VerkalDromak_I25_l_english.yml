 # Missions
 # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I25_conquest1_title:0 "Beyond our Walls"
 I25_conquest1_desc:0 "Retaking Verkal Dromak was a quest to match our ancestors’ greatest, an ordeal to rival any feat of dwarfkind. Now that we have settled into our Malachite hold, we can take time to rest, to sleep and recover our energy. But when that is done, rouse the generals and assemble the troops — our work is not yet done"

 I25_conquest2_title:0 "Hold the Jade"
 I25_conquest2_desc:0 "Grônstunad was once the center of an empire that thrived even as most of Aul-Dwarov crumbled. Our realm is nothing like theirs, and we have no desire to emulate their tawdry ambitions and trivial pursuits.\n\nBut we will take advantage of having secured the Jade Mines in one respect. In our journey to Verkal Dromak we noted the many creatures that infest the eastern Serpentspine, squatting on dwarven land. Let’s correct that now that we finally have the opportunity to, shall we?"

 I25_conquest3_title:0 "The Mountains Beyond"
 I25_conquest3_desc:0 "We came to these mountains to see dwarven rule restored, reclaiming the lands and holds and tunnels of our ancestors. And now that purpose is complete.\n\nWe can rest easy with the greenskins driven off, in an easy peace with the other dwarves who have joined us in this project. Yes, we shall rest indeed, and who knows what we might dream?"

 I25_medical_school_title:0 "Hall of the Medic"
 I25_medical_school_desc:0 "The beer-halls of Hul-az-Krakazol, hall of the ale-crafter, are flowing once more, which brings a smile to any dwarf’s face (and a stein to their lips). But a few see the potential for more in its verdant gardens and clever brewers: rather than potions of delicious intoxication, they might brew potions of healing and recovery.\n\nA medical school will mark the hold taking steps beyond what it was, to what it can be. We should start construction right away."

 I25_restoration_of_altar_title:0 "A Buried Altar"
 I25_restoration_of_altar_desc:0 "In our hold there is a hall, a massive room for stately affairs. In that hall there is a subchamber, accessible only via a dusty stone stairway. In that subchamber, there is an altar, faintly aglow with enchantments still. And within that altar?\n\nWell, even the most trained mages aren’t sure. But it seems the engravings indicate some sort of ritual, which they are eager to study further."

 I25_mage_tower_title:0 "The Channeling Tower"
 I25_mage_tower_desc:0 "For the mages to succeed in this strange ritual, they will need a centralized space for their research and to channel their arcane energies. A tall mage tower may be an odd sight buried below miles of rock, but it must be built for our efforts to bear fruit."

 I25_sort_out_problems_title:0 "Sleepwalking to Success"
 I25_sort_out_problems_desc:0 "The recent turmoil in the hold has left no dwarf untouched, and even the most subterranean of miners has had their sleep disturbed or work interfered with by some miscast spell.\n\nBut those days are finally behind us. Lessons have been learned, and prices paid, and they are not to be forgotten but nor must we obsess over them. All may finally rest, and rest easy… and may we all dream of the bright future that lays ahead."

 I25_sleeper_research_1_title:0 "Sleeper Research 1"
 I25_sleeper_research_1_desc:0 "The sleepers will have their beds, for the restless mind cannot delve into the deep reaches of dreams. Their slumber will be thick with visions from the cavernous depths of the unconscious."

 I25_sleeper_research_2_title:0 "Sleeper Research 2"
 I25_sleeper_research_2_desc:0 "Herbal draughts from deep within the forlorn caves of our hold send our sleepers spiraling into a more perfect slumber, replete with a newfound clarity of vision. Within the deep, chemical dreams, they see far further than most dwarves, as they stand upon the mountaintops of sleep. "

 I25_sleeper_research_3_title:0 "Sleeper Research 3"
 I25_sleeper_research_3_desc:0 "Our sleepers are not mere dreamers, they are the shepherds of dreams. Within their sleeping mind, wondrous visions are guided by experienced hands as ships enter port on the far away waves."

 I25_sleeper_research_4_title:0 "Sleeper Research 4"
 I25_sleeper_research_4_desc:0 "From within their palaces of silk the sleepers pull the marionette strings of their worlds, plucking wonders unknown from the soaring heights and deepest darknesses of the subliminal. From the great and terrible things they have seen, vast knowledge can be gleaned."

 I25_sleeper_research_5_title:0 "Sleeper Research 5"
 I25_sleeper_research_5_desc:0 "Oh sleep! It is a gentle thing, beloved from pole to pole. The people drink it like a desperate man dying of thirst will suck the blood from his own arm just to cry out in delight. From within their slumbering worlds the sleepers see all, yet still there is more to see."

 I25_education_of_people_title:0 "A New Way of Being"
 I25_education_of_people_desc:0 "For decades, if not centuries, our state was focused on the brutal affair of wresting our great hold back from the savages that held it. Our goal was just, our methods necessary, and our victory ever-so-sweet.\n\nWith that task done, though, we are left with a predicament: Most of our people are educated in mining, and in fighting, but there are tasks much more diverse that lay ahead. We shall build new academies in every hold under our control, that teach new skills — the skills of the future, not the past."

 I25_malachite_architects_title:0 "Malachite Architects"
 I25_malachite_architects_desc:0 "Weird. Befuddling. Mind-twisting. Mystifying. Built by a mind that cannot be dwarven. These are but a handful of the words used by foreigners in describing Malachite architecture. But anyone who was born here likes it, and we don’t mind outsiders being confused!"

 I25_architects_and_mages_title:0 "Architects and Mages"
 I25_architects_and_mages_desc:0 "Dwarves have tended to use clever engineering rather than powerful magic in ensuring a hold is well-defended. But we Malachite Dwarves ask, why not use both? With the mages consulted in our design of Verkal Dromak’s latest set of fortifications, we can build defenses that not only stand on their own, but resonate with our mages’ myriad rituals and channel arcane energy with maximum efficiency."

 I25_evolution_of_mazes_title:0 "Evolution of Mazes"
 I25_evolution_of_mazes_desc:0 "The Dwarovar’s most legendary mazes were those built by Kekig the Maze-maker of Verkal Skomdihr, whose twisting labyrinths were said to be able to keep even the Fey themselves at bay. Our latest designs may not match his brilliance — but they do come close.\n\nAny except those who follow a Malachite guide will be hard-pressed to even find our holds, let alone assault them."

 I25_diplomat_school_title:0 "School of Diplomats"
 I25_diplomat_school_desc:0 "In Verkal Dromak, we have always looked inward, peering into the mysteries that abound about us. If we had an opposite, perhaps it was the hold of Grôzumdihr, which sent countless envoys to the Raheni and maintained cordial, if not friendly, with almost every other hold even during the Last Days of the Dwarovar.\n\nWith the Peridot Hold finally matching its prior glory, we should ensure this tradition is not lost either. Dig up the hold’s lost writings and use them as the foundation of a new school, to ensure all our diplomats act in the finest traditions of Grôzumdihr (for the advancement of Verkal Dromak, of course)."

 I25_durable_constructions_title:0 "Durable Constructions"
 I25_durable_constructions_desc:0 "It is clear that there are certain lessons known to ancient dwarven engineers that remain beyond us now. But the recent dream of an engineer who fell asleep on (thankfully, empty) railroad tracks gave us insight into some of the principles which have led to the ancient rail still being present (if inoperational), and that knowledge should bolster constructions closer to home as well."

 I25_position_of_power_title:0 "Position of Power"
 I25_position_of_power_desc:0 "A new era dawns for Verkal Dromak. The Sleeper-King now rules, and our hold finally begins to pursue its most ancient purpose. We shall follow the Sleepers, wherever they might lead us!"

 I25_curtail_estates_title:0 "Curtail Estates"
 I25_curtail_estates_desc:0 "When we sleep, it is all we are doing, our bodies motionless and our brains busy with dreams and nothing else. Even when we wake, we shall follow the same principle — we will ignore the protestations of anyone else who seeks to influence our hold’s direction, and hew to the sleeper’s path alone."

 I25_new_government_title:0 "New Government"
 I25_new_government_desc:0 "Today, in a dream, our king had a glimpse of the future. To see that glimpse — and the promises within it — become reality, we must ensure every future leader has a similar potential, such that they may lead Verkal Dromak step after step on the same path."

 I25_we_need_more_sleep_title:0 "We Need More Sleep"
 I25_we_need_more_sleep_desc:0 "Every dwarf of Verkal Dromak deserves time to rest and sleep, to let their mind wander from dream to dream. A new law will guarantee the right to spend ten hours in bed, so that even the lowliest miner or worker shall not spend too long at their shift and away from their vital slumber."

 I25_moar_sleep_title:0 "MORE SLEEP"
 I25_moar_sleep_desc:0 "Everyone in Verkal Dromak is a dreamer, but not all dreams rank the same. Nor does every sleeper count among the Sleepers. Similarly, there are no dreams more important than that of our monarch, for those visions are what keep us to the path ahead.\n\nIn line with their pre-eminence, we shall enshrine a new tradition for our monarch. They shall spend half the year in a magically-enhanced sleep, to dream and dream and dream, and the other half spend awake with nigh-absolute control over the state to ensure we follow the dream’s guidance to the utmost."

 I25_dream_about_fighting_title:0 "A Dream of Conflict "
 I25_dream_about_fighting_desc:0 "It has been a long day, with some nasty court politics making a mess of the usual harmonious (well, harmonious enough) goings-on necessary for the continued prosperity of Verkal Dromak. For all my subordinates bickering, all responsibility ultimately lays on me, and today that burden weighs heavy. Is there no limit to what a dwarf can do in the name of ambition? But at least now, it is time, finally, to rest.\n\nTo sleep, perchance to dream..."

 I25_dream_about_gold_title:0 "Dream About Gold"
 I25_dream_about_gold_desc:0 "I am about to dim the lantern that had been giving light as I finished some of the day’s last paperwork, when my eye was caught by the light’s holder. Had they been replaced? Had I merely not noticed them before? Because they are formed of the most gorgeous gold, which seems to keep its lustre and glow even as I snuff the flame and head to bed.\n\nTo sleep, perchance to dream..."

 I25_dream_about_goblins_title:0 "Dream About Goblins"
 I25_dream_about_goblins_desc:0 "One of my harder jobs is informing dwarven mothers and fathers that their child has died while serving in the army, died to our hated green-skin foes. It is not an uncommon duty, indeed it is perhaps the most practiced rite, given it dates back to the Last Days of the Dwarovar themselves. And yet, each time, my head and heart are heavy as I finally retreat to slumber, another soul on my conscious — and a revenge tenfold already being planned.\n\nTo sleep, perchance to dream..."

 I25_dream_about_development_title:0 "Dream About Development"
 I25_dream_about_development_desc:0 "Today, as I proceeded to my bedchamber, I was struck by a rude awakening: the door would not open. Not even to a forceful shove, nor the concerted ram of two of my guardsmen. It took an embarrassed engineer over an hour to finally get it loose, but I for the most part ignored her mumbles about water seepage and temperature imbalance -- I was struck by the fine ornamentation on the portalway, something I had never really noticed before. Still, I am glad to have it over with, and the bed looms ahead of me.\n\nTo sleep, perchance to dream..."

 I25_dream_about_mountains_title:0 "Dream About Mountains"
 I25_dream_about_mountains_desc:0 "I still recall my mother telling me the story of how we dwarves were born from stone, shaped by Halanna countless eons ago. And, running my hand against the cold granite outside my bedchambers, I feel perhaps a whisper of that connection. It is cold yet comforting, stark yet serene. I wonder how it would feel to sleep on hard rock… but that shall have to be answered another night.\n\nTo sleep, perchance to dream."

 I25_dream_about_other_dwarves_title:0 "Dream About Other Dwarves"
 I25_dream_about_other_dwarves_desc:0 "Today’s work was occupied with the reception of a foreign delegation, dwarves from the west come to offer trade and establish diplomatic ties. I was welcoming, of course, but struck by the number of differences crowded amidst the similarities: they chuckled awkwardly when I wished them a good sleep and good dreams, and seemed agog at the sight of miners leaving their work to ensure they had time for a good rest that night. We may be the same people, but in so many other ways, we are entirely different. Still, I know what I know, and their doubts shall not change the value of tonight’s slumber.\n\nTo sleep, perhaps to dream..."

 I25_preparation_completed_title:0 "Preparation Completed"
 I25_preparation_completed_desc:0 "News of the artisan’s dream has spread through the hold in a susurration of excitement. The idea that somewhere, deep within the realm of slumber, there might be other dwarves has sent our sleepers into a frenzy. Every unwaking hour is spent mapping a route to our lost brothers, preparing to free them from the strange realm in which they have been lost."

 I25_permament_contact_title:0 "Permanent Connection"
 I25_permament_contact_desc:0 "Our link to the dwarven specters of Dûr-Vazhatun is tenuous at best, cataclysmic at worst. Our sleepers are furiously at rest boring a dream-tunnel into the isolated hold while the artisan who first conjured the portal from which the ghosts emerged has lapsed into a deep, deep slumber from which none can awake hime."

 I25_dream_about_our_hold_title:0 "Dream About Our Hold"
 I25_dream_about_our_hold_desc:0 "A good day, but my legs are sore. Even with a plethora of elevators, traversing the hold in a walking expectation will do that. It is good to finally rest those legs, and head to bed.\n\nTo sleep, perhaps to dream..."

 I25_kraken_expedition_title:0 "Kraken Expedition"
 I25_kraken_expedition_desc:0 "\"Be not afraid of cave-ins,\nof hard stone, and savage orcs.\nFear the creature that dwells\nin the darkest depths,\nthe stone-bound Kraken,\nthat threatens to surface\nand your soul to keep.\"\n\n-The Malachite court poet Erna Grcic, on learning of the cave-kraken."

 I25_dream_about_our_ancestors_title:0 "Dream About Our Ancestors"
 I25_dream_about_our_ancestors_desc:0 "The highlight of my work in the audience chamber today was a statue of the adventurer captain who beat back the Command and took Verkal Dromak. From solid stone, the artist had carved a dwarf who looked almost alive, with a near-lifelike fierceness and demeanour. It is a sight that still seems vivid in my head even as it meets the pillow.\n\nTo sleep, perhaps to dream..."

 I25_build_the_earthseed_altar_title:0 "Build the Earthseed Altar"
 I25_build_the_earthseed_altar_desc:0 "It was at Earthseed that Halanna shaped dwarves from stone, and from there that we first began the long path that would take us to rule the Serpentspine, lose it, and then rule it once more. In her honor, and to honor all that have come before, we must restorethe Earthseed shrine from its goblin-plagued, dilapidated state!"

 I25_dream_about_meaning_of_life_title:0 "Dream About Meaning of Life"
 I25_dream_about_meaning_of_life_desc:0 "42 steps, today, from the council-chambers to the bedroom. 42 minutes of paperwork at my desk, before my eyes could stay open no longer. And 42 seconds to fall asleep once my head hit the pillow.\n\nTo sleep, perhaps to dream..."

 I25_dream_about_magic_title:0 "Dream About Magic"
 I25_dream_about_magic_desc:0 "Magic. Just when you think you have it by the throat, it bites you in the rear. Though I only understood a fraction of the sleepers’ report today, it seems they have run into challenges with channeling the energy required for their latest experiment. It is in an impasse I cannot imagine solving, though I shall of course sleep on it tonight.\n\nTo sleep, perhaps to dream..."

 I25_recreate_the_tower_title:0 "Recreate the Tower"
 I25_recreate_the_tower_desc:0 "Normally, dwarves build down. But after our latest dream, it seems we must build up, and recreate the towering spire of our vision to leverage its magic-enhancing design."

 I25_improve_the_tower_title:0 "Improve the Tower"

 verkaldromak.1.t:0 "An Audience with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 verkaldromak.1.d:0 "It is just another afternoon audience for [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], akin to all the others held many times before. Delegations from other holds - or perhaps lords from Rahen - influential folk from all across and outside the realm pleading their cases for one thing or another. One of those in attendance is the local archmage, waiting impatiently for his case to be heard. He bursts forward when the court herald pronounces his case.\n\n“Sire, I must speak with you regarding a strange phenomenon that is taking place in our hold. People from all walks of life appear to be gaining some mystical powers - but their abilities manifest in ways hitherto unseen. We are calling them sleepers, because we hypothesize that they draw their energy whilst asleep. We don’t know if their casting is especially potent, or if it can be fully controlled, but the guild urges you to forbid them to use their powers without our supervision.”"
 verkaldromak.1.a:0 "This isn’t about safety, this is about power. Not with me!"
 verkaldromak.1.b:0 "Better safe than sorry, let the experienced mages be in control."

 verkaldromak.2.t:0 "Regulations in Place"
 verkaldromak.2.d:0 "Many months have passed since our decree allowing mage regulations was put in place. The good news is that the mages haven’t reported any particularly harmful incidents involving sleepers; the bad news is that the common folk are increasingly unsettled by the mages’ controlling ways, including a significant tax on the use of sleeper services - thus forcing the commoners to utilize the mages guild."
 verkaldromak.2.a:0 "We must put an end to this greed!"
 verkaldromak.2.b:0 "The common folk simply do not know what is best for their safety."

 verkaldromak.3.t:0 "Integration of the Sleepers"
 verkaldromak.3.d:0 "The sleepers are free to offer their services of their own accord - and thus far, this appears to have continued safely, with no major incidents reported. It seems they can handle themselves, without stifling mages’ interference."
 verkaldromak.3.a:0 "Their ability to work without supervision is a boon to our realm."
 verkaldromak.3.b:0 "But perhaps this is a trick...can we really trust that which we do not understand?"

 verkaldromak.4.t:0 "Magic From the People For the People"
 verkaldromak.4.d:0 "The Sleepers out-right refuse to be bound by the strictures of the mages’ guild since the rules would force them to “study for decades”. They argue that these strenuous requirements are a power play by the mages, to give the guild time to find a lasting solution to regain its power. They were able to help people even without pockets deep enough to afford the guild to get magical help and they want it to stay that way — the guild’s monopoly must be broken.."
 verkaldromak.4.a:0 "Perhaps the sleepers are right - are these harmless magicks not for the people?"

 verkaldromak.5.d:0 "The mages' guild is increasingly displeased with the decisions of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] pertaining to the sleepers. This situation is stirring trouble not only in our realm, but trickling into the world beyond.\n\nMages everywhere are dispatching delegations and communiques to request changes in our policy, and even [A85.Monarch.GetName], the [A85.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Magisterium has reached out.\n\nThe esteemed scholar and well-trained mage notes that several previous catastrophes have afflicted once mighty realms over similar power dynamics; alternative power structures with unregulated magic potential dissolving great empires and leading to untold suffering."
 verkaldromak.5.a:0 "This desperate clinging to power is pathetic."
 verkaldromak.5.b:0 "They may be right - history often repeats itself."

 verkaldromak.6.t:0 "The Establishment Holds Together"
 verkaldromak.6.d:0 "No estate tends to stand alone - altogether, they’re complex machinery, each cog in the wheel interlocking to ensure the function of the whole. The mages are now calling on their interlocked cogs, using leverage on key figures in the clergy, nobility, and other estates to tip the balance against [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nA united front of the realm’s powerful and influential now stands against us…"
 verkaldromak.6.a:0 "Power corrupts; and this corruption has spread too far."

 verkaldromak.7.t:0 "Remember: Your Power Comes From Us"
 verkaldromak.7.d:0 "The estates are growing more confident in their strength - they have sent [Root.Monarch.GetName] an ultimatum regarding the sleepers. Expel them, or the estates will be forced to step in and ‘save the nation from a ruler whose acts threaten their own subjects’."
 verkaldromak.7.a:0 "It’s treason then!"
 verkaldromak.7.b:0 "Heed their words, stability and internal peace is more important than some minor mages."

 verkaldromak.8.t:0 "The Mages Are Dead, Long Live the Mages!"
 verkaldromak.8.d:0 "In the end, the mages have paid the price for their arrogance. Most of the guild’s members lie slain in the corridors of their academy, and many of those captured soon to be hung from its walls.\n\nWhile the fighting was fierce, leaving the marks of savage sorcery everywhere, the common folk have proven surprisingly resilient, already resuming their daily lives. The power vacuum left by the guild’s destruction is already being filled by the sleepers; such an abrupt act has startled the other estates, but they will accede to this change in time."
 verkaldromak.8.a:0 "Hopefully this dark chapter will be left behind us…"

 verkaldromak.9.t:0 "Never Forget Your History"
 verkaldromak.9.d:0 "The sleepers have had enough of their suppression, and are now rising up! In a matter of minutes, their previously unrealized strength has allowed them to seize key strategic locations across the capital. Their aggressive ambushes have annihilated large numbers of our loyal troops; and even worse, the commoners seem to be supporting the sleepers, rendering any hunt for the sleepers impossible! Our once proud capital now lies stained and broken in a state of war.\n\nAnd if that wasn’t enough, grim tidings have been brought from the palace; the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and their family have been murdered by a usurper, claiming lineage to the ancient dynastic rulers of Verkal Dromak. And his new orders are clear; align with the sleepers, and purge the mages. Given the current momentum of the conflict, it is no surprise that most soldiers are willing to obey this directive; and those who do not are swiftly given a sharp lesson in the newfound strength of the sleepers."
 verkaldromak.9.a:0 "Opportunism or not, the orders are clear."

 verkaldromak.10.t:0 "A Shared Dream"
 verkaldromak.10.d:0 "The Sleeper always labeled themselves as a provider for all people. They support those whose actions helped not some but many. Even if this attitude is commonly known, their latest consequence is a surprise for [Root.Monarch.GetName]: As they see the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as the first servant of the state, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should have all power to serve his people. Including, of course, the power of magic."

 verkaldromak.12.t:0 "Their Ways Are Off"
 verkaldromak.12.d:0 "Since they started their studies, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed many successes in their rigorous studies and practice. However, they never had the feeling it was truly driven by their own abilities.\n\nThe sleepers seem pleased no matter how the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] succeeds or fails, and a strange feeling about their overly enthusiastic attitudes has begun to bother [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 verkaldromak.13.t:0 "Unsuccessful spy mission"
 verkaldromak.13.d:0 "Peering into the affairs of sleepers is a difficult task, even for the most skilled of operatives. It seems that in spite of the quality of our spies, they discovered no plot nor scheme. Perhaps there is none, or perhaps they evade any waking eyes."

 verkaldromak.14.t:0 "Swallowed by the Darkness"
 verkaldromak.14.d:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and their family are taking a seasonal trip via rail to their palace on the surface. The car moves slowly through the tunnels, passing caverns full of mines, mushroom farms, and friendly workers waving to the passing leaders.\n\nAs they approach a bridge stretching over a dark canyon, the air is suddenly filled with the sound of bursting glass and screeching steel plates as the rail line snaps and the car goes careening over the edge. The passengers’ heads snap back, and in terror they fall down into the depths. A rescue party only manages to recover their corpses…"
 verkaldromak.14.a:0 "The new ruler Gotrek, former archmage of the Sleepers, proclaims a week of mourning."

 verkaldromak.15.t:0 "Suspicious. Very Suspicious."
 verkaldromak.15.d:0 "Nervous footsteps echo throughout the silent yet packed room, as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Gotrek paces and struggles to comprehend the spiraling situation, his advisors unable to provide any help at all. Plans of usurping power, now rendered as useless tattered threads. Mounting investigations - with him being one of the prime suspects - may even find these threads, incriminating him for a crime he was innocent of.\n\nThe clamor of the various clans and estates rise to another level, teetering at the edge of pandemonium. With a wretched look, he beckons to his advisors outside the room to finally address the dwarf-filled hall. His arrival, however, silences only few, as the other clans and estates still discuss in whispers and bellows about accusations and speculations surrounding the incident, and of course the occasional grudges. After a while, the clans and estates finally settle down, having reached a consensus to accuse [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Gotrek and the sleepers guild in thinly veiled words of regicide.\n\nShould Gotrek and the mages not acquiesce to an intensive and independent investigation, the assembly makes it clear that Gotrek will be held accountable. Such gall - even Gotrek, the still-influential former leader of the guild is not privy to the detail of this incident; how could the estates think they will find details where he could not?\n\nNo matter how this incident is interpreted, if it truly is a concocted scheme and not a natural accident, angry fingers will be pointed at him for his perceived involvement. But by the same stroke, launching an investigation may absolve him and his guild of guilt, and appease both the commoners and the estates for now. But should his earlier plots be discovered, his guilt will be proven..."
 verkaldromak.15.a:0 "Commence investigations immediately!"
 verkaldromak.15.b:0 "No way mages could do something like that"

 verkaldromak.16.t:0 "No Proof?"
 verkaldromak.16.d:0 "The investigators have found nothing to incriminate Gotrek, and now he is faced with two options: Find those who tried to have him slandered and framed, or give up on this endeavor entirely, returning to the affairs of state which desperately require his attention."
 verkaldromak.16.a:0 "Do whatever needs to be done."
 verkaldromak.16.b:0 "Begone. This is a waste of our money, time, and respect."

 verkaldromak.17.t:0 "Investigation?"
 verkaldromak.17.d:0 "Putting down the parcel from his aide, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Gotrek finally sighs in relief as most of the loose threads are taken care of. He feels another headache, however, when he hears that another elite, this time coming from the mages guild, is requesting an audience. With impatience, he accommodates him and carefully states that he will not stop the investigation. Soon after, however, his advisors voice similar opinions to that of the mage. They state that the investigation has not only dug deep into our coffers, but also antagonized many elites - most of all, the mages guild, which is comprised of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s most stalwart supporters.\n\nYet how could you stop now; you are being presented with an opportunity of not only weeding out those that brought about this mess, but also potentially gaining the support of some of the clans and estates."
 verkaldromak.17.a:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] says: no."

 verkaldromak.18.t:0 "Where is He?"
 verkaldromak.18.d:0 "While the investigation seemed to be closing in on the culprits, the reports of the detective have stopped. It seems that… there are some complications in the investigation, mainly being that the detective has gone missing and no traces of him can be seen whatsoever. Even his personal and private house provided to him by the state was cleaned out, with no traces of any furniture or dwarven presence at all. It isn’t long until the clans, estates, and even the people living at the darkest corner of the hold know of the news, inciting gasps and uproar.\n\nHowever, you are nothing but powerless at this moment. A puppet that has only now seen the vague strings controlling him. All of your advisors that aren’t mages have disappeared; the plots you have worked so hard to hide are uncovered and used to blackmail you; and most of all, no one will believe you. That you, the former leader of the mages, were used and betrayed by the same mages that are still supporting you now. The mages’ demands are not simple, but still feasible for someone of your current power. With the mages' support, detectives are hired again, but hindered in every way such that the investigation practically ground to a halt. One way or another, you were able to finally obtain the throne you were aiming for. It’s a little late and with numerous hiccups, but now that there are no more hidden threats and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s rule is firmly secured, we can now truly say…"

 verkaldromak.20.t:0 "Dream about Development"
 verkaldromak.20.d:0 "Architecture in marble, granite, and more. Malachite, cut in every shape known to dwarf, casting rainbow patterns in the torchlight. The thrum of dwarves at work, making the hold even better. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has walked these halls and seen these in the light of day, but it all seems super-saturated in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dream tonight, infused with a splendor that must rival the height of Aul-Dwarov.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] smiles in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sleep, proud of what the hold has become, long removed from the days of goblin squatters. Turning into another corridor, the tapestries on the wall depicting the hold’s glorious reconquest. Descending a spiral stairway, following a line of glowing malachite along the wall. Opening a door of solid Ghankedhen oak.\n\nAnd then. Darkness. Horror. Death. Terror. Pain. It comes too quick to know the details, but as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] awakes with a start, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows the grim truth: somewhere, amidst the resplendent hold, there lurks a devouring darkness. And it is waiting."
 verkaldromak.20.a:0 "Oh no..."

 verkaldromak.21.t:0 "Dream about Gold"
 verkaldromak.21.d:0 "At first, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] thinks this is one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] more boring dreams. A single hue, filling their vision, with the occasional shift of tone or light but little else. A lovely hue, orange-yellow, but a monochromatic vision is not what [Root.Monarch.GetName] expects when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] lays down to slumber.\n\nThen, finally, motion. A moving out, a moving away. Finally, there is more than just the colour, and it is put in context. There is a sea of colour, in a vast chamber.\n\nFurther out, faster. The sea is a size to boggle the mind. And there, at a corner of the chamber, are those dwarves? Quickly, the vision approaches them. In an accented tongue, [Root.Monarch.GetName] makes out only a handful of words — “expanding the Citadel Delve” — before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] snaps awake.\n\nFor a few more moments, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] lays in bed. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has seen what must be the inside of Verkal Gulan, its amassed fortune. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] may never see a sight to rival its wealth again, for all the years remaining."

 verkaldromak.22.a:0 "Glorious glorious gold."

 verkaldromak.23.t:0 "Dream about Goblins"
 verkaldromak.23.d:0 "The goblin. As despicable as it is pitiful. They build nothing, create nothing, only plundering the work of great dwarves from ages hence. Their presence is an insult to our ancestors and ourselves, crawling and scampering in holds that, in ruin, stand greater than anything a goblin has ever built."
 verkaldromak.23.a:0 "They are but cowards, feeding on the carrion of a dead empire."

 verkaldromak.24.t:0 "Dream About Other Dwarves"
 verkaldromak.24.d:0 "An elderly dwarf artisan claims to have discovered a method to open a portal to a strange land, in which - allegedly - reside a number of dwarves who the dwarf claims to have seen in dreams. As unbelievable as this may seem, he further claims that he just needs a few ingredients and some manpower to develop such a connection - luckily, most of these ingredients are available in local markets. All he needs is a bit of gold, if we wished to explore this..."
 verkaldromak.24.a:0 "We should pay"

 verkaldromak.25.t:0 "They are weak"
 verkaldromak.25.d:0 "The dwarves spawned from the portal are ghastly, seemingly the ancestors of our Ruby Dwarf brethren. As they come through the portal onto our lands, they have begun to attempt to reclaim their old hold of Dûr-Vazhatun - [Root.Monarch.GetName] believes that we can take advantage of this conflict, seizing the hold for ourselves with the aid of these ghostly dwarves!"
 verkaldromak.25.a:0 "Attack!"

 verkaldromak.26.t:0 "Stabilizing the Connection"
 verkaldromak.26.d:0 "With Dûr-Vazhatun claimed, its isolation prompts us with a dilemma - the link to the far hold is tenuous at best, allowing only some level of verbal communication and little else. Even worse, the dwarven artisan mage who created the initial portal has passed - and he did not leave his notes for anyone else! Perhaps in the future, we might find another skilled enough to stabilize and expand the portal, reopening the way to Dûr-Vazhatun."

They start to cry over the perils Halann seems to be in.\n\nBut suddenly the rock starts to shift at a place that can only be Earthseed and dwarfs emerge from the depth. They quickly start tending to the writhing of Halanns surface and give it form and consistency.\n\nThe calmness spreading over Halann reaches  [Root.Monarch.GetName] and they sink back into the void of their sleep."

And where there was a flat vista, suddenly, there is a growing range, the earth being thrust sky-high.\n\nHills, then mountains, then towering peaks. Massive edifices carved with caverns — whatever this dream is of, there are no roads, no holds, not yet. And in those caverns? What will I see there?\n\nA question for another night. But I am left with the vision, and a desire to see these oft-overlooked caves in the flesh."

 verkaldromak.30.d:0 "The sleeper’s consciousness wades through the fabric of dreams; this time through shifting hues that seem to speak words of their own, and mesmerizingly flow to form grand worlds. During this delve, however, he has also felt an entity’s gaze, not uncommon for those that delve the world of dreams -- though its close attention today is alarming. Alas for the sleeper, they have been followed and hovered about many times…for years, even.\n\nEach chance encounter, the watcher would confine the sleeper in the world of dreams for what seemed like an eternity. The sleeper felt the entity’s gaze lift from him for a moment, observing this dream world with ravenous curiosity. The sleeper felt it move, reaching towards a floating dream, crushing and remaking it into fleshy sands that wriggle with overflowing life and hostility. The sands then congregate, to be undone and remade once again into perverted dreams of perfection, this time of his friends and loved ones beckoning to him to join them in a feast. A dream he had seen countless times as many others did, and upon that thought, all the food and person melt into squelching sands that slither away back into the dark confines of the dreams.\n\nThis success only makes the sleeper groan, as he again anticipates in the near future the countless petty tricks the entity would throw again, and again, with seemingly no reason but to annoy him. Another one of the wriggling tentacles attempted to slither into the darkness in his mind, another one of the tricks of the entity that he has already gotten tired of squashing. This time, however, the entity suddenly tugged on his mind with forcefulness far beyond its previous efforts. A void slowly devours this dream world, and the entity’s presence creeps closer and closer. Even knowing it is but a dream, the sleeper dares not look at it, dares not envision it, but it nonetheless approaches him. As much as the dreamer tries to hold fast, his eyes involuntarily flicker towards motion and sound of the approaching water looming before him. It is not complacency that breaks the sleeper - no, it is simply time that has ground down on him, time and its endless tricks breaking him.\n\nHorror fills him as the wriggling flesh from before swarms his now defenseless mind. It invades every corner and every thought as they move with ravenous curiosity. The sleeper screamed with his eyes still shut; he screamed for what seemed to be ages across the void. Suddenly, he felt the wriggling flesh stop and the entity move. Vaguely, he saw what seemed to be its mouth move. It spoke a single word with feelings of joy, longing, wonder, admiration, and a desolate and ephemeral beauty. Death.\n\nThe sleeper opened his eyes to see, and all he saw was the entity staring straight into his soul, and he saw it all. The sleeper saw visions of carnage, slaughter, and chaos by otherworldly creatures that hide in plain sight across Halann. They will awaken from their slumber and come, all of them, and then the world will return from whence it came. Through one of his glimpses however, he saw a creature that slumbered beneath the depths of their hold. A creature with eight enormous and slimy tentacles that stretch farther into the dark caves, with a head bearing an enormous maw lined with countless teeth double the size of an adult dwarf. The sleeper, no, the High King of Verkal Dromak awoke from what seemed ages of sleep, and immediately shouted for his closest aide to come, commanding him to call all of the clans and the finest adventurers across Dwarovar. There can be no effort wasted for this, as even all the preparations of their supposedly mad ancestor are far from enough. He has been burdened by this knowledge, and by the ancestors, he will do whatever it takes to slay the creature."

His compiled adventures and chronicles for his pension would have to wait, at least until he can sort out this sorry bunch of “expeditionary forces”. He takes out his oldpipe, a lovely gift from a Halfling mercenary, or what’s left of him anyway. He misses that old couth; at least the Halfling was more competent than these so-called “heroes”. No matter. Kubrak Ironarm, the finest adventurer of Dwarovar ever since its reclamation, will whip them up!

The party of dwarves nonetheless find themselves in a quandary, quite literally a fork in the cavern, due to a critical detail left unexplained to the adventurers prior to departing. An Amber Dwarf mentions the plants on the ground and walls of the cavern leading to the left, which most likely fit the ecosystem of their quarry based on the rough description the King has given them. A Mithril Dwarf, however, points out that the right side has a damper air, a possible sign of a lake or another source of water that may be the habitat of the creature. But Kubrak knows, and it is Kubrak that decides."
 verkaldromak.33.a:0 "“We have a map, and fortunately, a secret way."
 verkaldromak.33.b:0 "“To the left, comrades!”"
 verkaldromak.33.c:0 "“You can never go wrong in going right.”"

 verkaldromak.34.t:0 "First Troubles"
 verkaldromak.34.d:0 "Kubrak and his expedition moved further down the depths, occasionally stopping for breaks. The group stops at an incomplete dugout cave, and camps there. Kubrak munches on his fried fungi rations while keeping watch on the surroundings. A little precaution never hurt anyone.\n\nAlas; his efforts are wasted as the enemy announce themselves with shrill screams, echoing through the dark caves, which he grumpily reciprocates with a bow and bellow to his companions, followed by a chain of curses as they hastily assemble themselves.Decent at best. But he’ll drill them later. For now, there is glory to be had."
 verkaldromak.34.a:0 "CHAAARGEEEEE!"

 verkaldromak.35.t:0 "Going Down and Down"
 verkaldromak.35.d:0 "Going further down, Kubrak’s expedition continues without much change in pace and scenery. While maps help them orient their location, it isn’t really much help, as this stretch is simply a straight stone corridor.. Boredom slowly bogs the minds of Kurbrak’s companions, himself included. Writing in his book, he makes some messy scribbles to correct mistakes he previously overlooked, passing the time. One day however, a peculiar mouse starts stalking the group, making its presence known with its annoying squeaks throughout day and night. Many, many attempts to kill the annoying RAT all end up failing, and it keeps avoiding all the lures they have set. It also seems to pass through traps completely, as it appears in whatever directions it pleases, regardless of the direction..\n\nFinally, the damned rat is cornered against the wall! Hammer raised, and with a shout, Kubrak bringst it down with tremendous weight. Yet at the last moment, the rat leaps towards a hole in the cave walls. With the hammer chasing it, the rat darts in, and the cavern wall breaks apart. Shock fills the group as the rat scurries off squeaking into the far darkness. This cave system wasn’t mentioned in the maps at all. Confirming his hunch, Kubrak hammers down cavern walls they had passed prior, and some parts indeed break down. He then moves forward with his torch, immediately stepping on something soft. Immediately, light grows from his feet and towards the nearby walls. Various fungi litter the floor and the walls, forming an overgrowth across the wide cavern. The rat, the long corridor, and this seemingly artificial cavern wall. Nothing about this is natural. Finally, they are on the right path towards their quarry."
 verkaldromak.35.a:0 "Wealth and the unknown. The spice of a good adventure!"

 verkaldromak.36.t:0 "Ambush!"
 verkaldromak.36.d:0 "The expedition moves across this new environment with both curiosity and caution. Kubrak is no exception; even with all he has seen, few can match the bizarre allure of this place. Fluorescent fungi on the ceiling, their long stems seemingly move at the whims of the wind. Even the slightest of motions garners a reaction from these, much like the mushrooms that bend and shy away from their presence. Some were also like the brambleshroom, a fungi he just named, towering in height and with hardness not inferior to ironwood. As tempted as Kubrak is to just stop and describe these countless curiosities in his book, he forces himself awake, continuing to give orders. They must scout the area for supplies, enemies, and attempt to map out the area to at least gain their bearings before they march ahead. After what seems like days, some news of a familiar friend finally greets them. The voice of the scout they sent ahead calls to them - the familiar squeaks of a rat are heard again!\n\ngonna continue tomorrow. intend it to be rat found to be on the ground with pulsing red veins on its body.\n\nStrange animals jumped from above! we killed them, but there were some losses :("
 verkaldromak.36.a:0 "Let's not stop, we need to go faster"
 verkaldromak.36.b:0 "Let's get their skins, might be needed later"

 verkaldromak.37.t:0 "Where do we go"
 verkaldromak.37.d:0 "The expedition enters a huge cavern with rather crumbly ground. At their entrance a pond fed by a waterfall and filled with fish forms a small peninsula. The group decides to rest and while most catch some fish to restock at least some food a small group starts scouting the cavern further ahead.\n\nThey stick to the wall and move clockwise. The cave hasn’t really much more to offer but they find three exits. First a shaft descending thirty forty meters straight down, only accessible if they use some of their remaining rope, then a tunnel looking like it was eaten into the stone and lastly a stalagmite with a spiral around it making it possible to jump into a tunnel further up the wall.\n\nAs they return and give their report the group decides for a way."
 verkaldromak.37.a:0 "We need to go deeper."
 verkaldromak.37.b:0 "There is water coming from above us, up we go."
 verkaldromak.37.c:0 "Maybe the beast that ate the stone was the kraken?"

 verkaldromak.38.t:0 "Small Animal"
 verkaldromak.38.d:0 "As the party travels along the tunnel they see a small white fluffy animal hopping across their path. Wondering how something so cute could survive down here they draw closer. Suddenly the animal leaps two meter onto the first dwarf and decapitates him with one bite. The rest draw their weapons and charge the beast."
 verkaldromak.38.a:0 "If it weren’t for the grenade we’d be all dead right now."
 verkaldromak.38.b:0 " Death awaited all with nasty, big, pointy teeth."

 verkaldromak.39.t:0 "Strange Animals"
 verkaldromak.39.d:0 "The party enters a cave covered densely with mushrooms. They encounter a group of strange quadrupeds feeding on the mushrooms. They have white antlers with their front half being yellow orange with black spots while their back half is the other way around and their black tail ends in a globe.\n\nThey approach the animals but as they get closer the tails suddenly raise up and present two eyes and a mouth full of sharp teeth. In a blink of the eye the animals charge the dwarfs backwards and are upon them."
 verkaldromak.39.a:0 "Go for the heads!"
 verkaldromak.39.b:0 "They were so fast the party couldn’t even draw their weapons."

 verkaldromak.40.t:0 "What a Monster!"
 verkaldromak.40.d:0 " The party marches through some kind of forest growing along an underground river as suddenly a bunch of tentacles break out from the bushes from their right, grab a bunch of dwarfs and drag them away.\n\n“It’s the kraken! After them!” the leader yells and the group sprints down the path their comrades got dragged only seconds ago. Quickly they reach a clearing littered with bones only to see the dwarfs disappearing into the gaping mouth of a plant. Totally surprised the group loses its momentum. The moment they recover from the shock they notice the forest around them coming to life as dozens of roots and lianas wind in their direction."
 verkaldromak.40.a:0 "That was a tough fight. Unfortunately, it wasn't the kraken we killed..."
 verkaldromak.40.b:0 "There is a tentacle beast down there waiting to claim all dwarven life."

 verkaldromak.41.t:0 "Lost in the Caves"
 verkaldromak.41.d:0 "The party enters a cavern with multiple exits. They choose one and follow it for some time until they hit a cave-in. They return and try the next only to enter the cave again somewhere else. The next gets so narrow not even a stinky goblin could get through. The fourth ends on the shores of a giant lake and the fifth half way down a deep canyon. Finally the last one seems to lead somewhere."
 verkaldromak.41.a:0 "At least we got back on track."

 verkaldromak.42.t:0 "Nice Flowers"
 verkaldromak.42.d:0 "Bloodied, ragged, and exhausted. The bizarre caverns are home to hostile eyes,stalking beyond the reaches of the expedition’s feeble torches. Kubrak and his companions can only muster their strength to shuffle their feet and keep their eyes open, but even that won't last. As they feel darkness creep at the corner of their consciousness, the ground beneath them falls apart. Kubrak closes his eyes to embrace the end, yet what they land on is not the hard cavern floor or a stalagmite, but something soft. Kubrak’s mind raced in horror as he imagined what beast they had fallen into. He vainly attempts to stand and run, only to fall without a single step taken. All in one swift motion,\n\nThe expedition members find themselves surrounded by softly glowing flowers, some fragmented after cushioning their fall. A warmer glow fills the party members; the eyes in the dark are not found here. Perhaps the party can rest for a moment?"
 verkaldromak.42.a:0 "Everything will be alright"

 verkaldromak.43.t:0 "A Complex of Caves"
 verkaldromak.43.d:0 "The party reenters the all too familiar cavern with the pond. The way they chose led to nothing and so they have returned. Now they have a choice to make: do they make another attempt or do they simply surrender and return to Verkal Dromak?"
 verkaldromak.43.a:0 "Maybe the shaft was the right way."
 verkaldromak.43.b:0 "Perhaps we should have gone up where the water came from."
 verkaldromak.43.c:0 "Let’s try following the dug tunnel instead."
 verkaldromak.43.e:0 "The ground is soft enough we will make our own way!"
 verkaldromak.43.r:0 "It was a futile attempt to blindly go into the deep anyway."

 verkaldromak.301.t:0 "Expedition died"
 verkaldromak.301.d:0 "Expedition was shattered. Exeryone died.\n\n Everyone except Kubrak! As the last brave man he survived hiding behind one on big stones in the cave. When the beast left he decided he must return to the hold. This place is too dangerous to explore."
 verkaldromak.301.a:0 "Lets go."

 verkaldromak.302.t:0 "Kubrak"
 verkaldromak.302.d:0 "Kubrak arrived to the hold. With so many injuries that everybody wondered why he still lives. \n\nOur expedition failed. Do we want to hire adventurers from the guild? Maybe they can handle the Kraken..."
 verkaldromak.302.a:0 "We should do it."
 verkaldromak.302.b:0 "It's too expensive."

 verkaldromak.44.t:0 "What to Tell the King?"
 verkaldromak.44.d:0 "The party returns to Verkal Dromak. On the way back they debated for hours what to tell of their expedition. A dispute about honor, wealth, reputation and maybe their death that in the end can only bear fruits that only a few can really be happy with. On the last morning before reentering civilization, they stepped together and held a vote."
 verkaldromak.44.a:0 "Sorry, we found nothing."
 verkaldromak.44.b:0 "It’s dead and we even have its skin as proof."
 verkaldromak.44.c:0 "You were right our liege, it was a terrible beast but it lays at rest now. "
 verkaldromak.44.e:0 "We found it but it was too strong. We are the sole survivors."

 verkaldromak.45.t:0 "Nothing Stays Hidden Forever"
 verkaldromak.45.d:0 "The party would have gotten away with their lie. But as it is the way of adventurers they tend to uncontrollable drinking and one of them slipped the truth. To their misfortune it happened right in front of loyal guards dragging him to prison to get the whole truth out of them."
 verkaldromak.45.a:0 "Shouldn't have said that, should not have said that."

 verkaldromak.46.t:0 "Hiring Experts"
 verkaldromak.46.d:0 "It seems like a famous adventurer band has heard of our failed expedition and they have come to offer their skills for coin. They hail from the coast of the Rahen Gulf and claim to be experienced in slaying krakens."
 verkaldromak.46.a:0 "We should do it."
 verkaldromak.46.b:0 "It's too expensive."

 verkaldromak.47.t:0 "It’s Still Down There"
 verkaldromak.47.d:0 "It seems like a famous adventurer band has heard of our failed expedition and they have come to offer their skills for coin. They hail from the coast of the Rahen Gulf and claim to be experienced in slaying krakens"
 verkaldromak.47.a:0 "We should do it."
 verkaldromak.47.b:0 "It's too expensive."

 verkaldromak.48.t:0 "The Kraken is Killed!"
 verkaldromak.48.d:0 "The Raheni adventurers we hired seemed to be worth every piece of gold they demanded. Today they returned and presented the court with parts of skin of the foul beast. They look beaten up but didn’t lose a single member, truly we should hire foreigners more often."
 verkaldromak.48.a:0 " And again our dreams led us to safety."

 verkaldromak.49.t:0 "Lies, Damned Lies, and Adventurers"
 verkaldromak.49.d:0 "Our scientists step before their ruler with unsure steps. “My liege,” one of them starts to speak with a shaking voice “it seems we’ve been tricked. The skin we are experimenting on for weeks now is certainly not from one being and probably not even from a kraken.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is fuming and calls for a manhunt offering a significant amount of gold for any significant hint."
 verkaldromak.49.a:0 "They are long gone. They probably knew it would happen."

 verkaldromak.50.t:0 "Dreams of Magic"
 verkaldromak.50.d:0 "I dreamt of mages building a tower, flinging spells in every direction as the great structure rises towards the cavern roof. The air itself is filled with powerful energy, rippling through the depths."
 verkaldromak.50.a:0 "Perhaps this is a pursuit worth following"

 verkaldromak.51.t:0 "The Growing Tower"
 verkaldromak.51.d:0 "The tower grows greater still, though there is a new strange essence instilled upon it. It resonates with power and mystery - as it should - but there is something missing..."
 verkaldromak.51.a:0 "What more can be done to improve it?"

 verkaldromak.52.t:0 "The Tower"
 verkaldromak.52.d:0 "As the tower has grown, so too has that unsettling atmosphere, which extends beyond the tower itself and into the surrounding environs. Strange noises can be heard from the tower, utterances and chants, yelps and cries dissimilar from the standard mage tower of other holds."
 verkaldromak.52.a:0 "How odd..."

 verkaldromak.53.t:0 "Immortal Dreams"
 verkaldromak.53.d:0 "The dreams of the tower continue, colored by a far darker presence than before. The tower has reached its peak, but so too has the wickedness that diffuses from it - a great horde of undead seeps from its base, but are held back by a lone figure in tattered black robes standing upon a balcony gazing down. A Witch-King.\n\nAs they stare down upon their new subjects, their gaze slowly drifts towards the dreamer; though their face is covered by a fragmented ebony mask, fractured by lines and shaped in an endless scream, the dreamer can feel their eyes meet. And with such a meeting comes great knowledge."
 verkaldromak.53.a:0 "And it is terrifying."

 verkaldromak.54.t:0 "We Should Know More Now"
 verkaldromak.54.d:0 "The dreamer awakes, their mind now privy to previously forbidden knowledge. While just a dream, they are certain that such a dream could be made reality, delivered unto our hold. But with every pursuit of power comes a price."
 verkaldromak.54.a:0 "We must not follow this path - and we must prevent any others from such a potential as well."
 verkaldromak.54.b:0 "Why should we reject such power? Every school of magic has its place, and can be bent to serve our people."

 verkaldromak.55.t:0 "Nothing Beside Remains"
 verkaldromak.55.d:0 "Jaher, the great conqueror. Emperor of Bulwar, Rahen, and Far Haless. He died to a knife in the back, as did his son, Jarael, who, while seeking unity, was murdered in the name of discord. So departed also Jexis, daughter of Jaher. In her elven fanaticism she sought the return of an empire of old for her kind. Killed, to her disgrace, by a human.\n\nThe greatest rulers of all, and their legacy is being dissolved in the slow hiss of centuries passing. Do not weep for your own passing from history, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], for it is the way of all things."
 verkaldromak.55.a:0 "The lone and level sands stretch far away."

 verkaldromak.58.t:0 "The Fate of a Conqueror"
 verkaldromak.58.d:0 "The air is different in the hold as [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares the rituals for this year’s rest. For the first time in ages, the Dwarovar is united. For the first time in ages, the dwarves dream not of the glories of the past but rather for the ones yet to come."
 verkaldromak.58.a:0 "And then he was assassinated!"

 verkaldromak.59.t:0 "Meaning of Life"
 verkaldromak.59.d:0 "Somehow this is the strangest dream [Root.Monarch.GetName] ever had. They sit in a circle with a whale, two mice, a human and a blinking metal box with a glass window displaying the number 42 and they are debating if this is really the meaning of life, whatever “this” might be. They feel totally out of place and get very uncomfortable as the box speaks to them and asks: “Are at least you accepting my answer?”"
 verkaldromak.59.a:0 "I’d rather be in a pub at the edge of the universe right now."

 # Event chain 6 - Last sleeper research
 # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 verkaldromak.62.t:0 "Go to the Source"
 verkaldromak.62.d:0 "The Sleepers approach the court to ask for help for yet their most daring attempt to allow our ruler to delve into the depth of time and space in their dreams. They want to incorporate the altar into the best resting place that ever was and will be. As it is presumably the source of our dreams being closer to it would only make our dreaming more powerful."
 verkaldromak.62.a:0 " Look where our dreams brought us to. How could we not?"

 verkaldromak.63.t:0 "All According to Plan"
 verkaldromak.63.d:0 "The Sleeper’s representatives gathered in front of the court for their annual update. They go over diagrams and charts for hours. With smiley faces and voices filled with joy and pride they talk about their progress."
 verkaldromak.63.a:0 "A short everything is fine could have saved a lot of time."

 verkaldromak.64.t:0 "New Results"
 verkaldromak.64.d:0 "Another year, another project update. The Sleepers tell how they were able to achieve the first manipulations of the energy of the altar and how at first their gauges got fried because their measurements went far beyond the scales. But now that they adjusted they are able to quantify the effects of their new experiments."
 verkaldromak.64.a:0 " They sure do know how to handle these powers."

 verkaldromak.65.t:0 "Rolling in the Deep!"
 verkaldromak.65.d:0 "Today is the day of the next update about the ongoing Sleeper experiment. As the court gathers the hold is shaken and a blue energy wave travels through the whole city. Minutes later some Sleepers stumble into the hall looking like they went through a heavy storm. “Don’t worry, this is just part of the conclusion of the last weeks of experiments. We were finally able to get the altar to feed itself with its own energy and it’s now permanently active.”"
 verkaldromak.65.a:0 "That doesn’t sound like control stop it for now."
 verkaldromak.65.b:0 " A process creating the energy it needs by itself and it can be harnessed? Go on."

 verkaldromak.66.t:0 "Can’t Stop it"
 verkaldromak.66.d:0 "The Sleepers stepping in front of the court look troubled. “My liege I’m sorry to tell you we can’t turn down the altar. We can’t get it back to not feeding on its own energy.”"
 verkaldromak.66.a:0 "Not doing anything isn’t an option. Keep trying."

 verkaldromak.67.t:0 "What should we do?"
 verkaldromak.67.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] got called down into the depths of Verkal Dromak to meet with the brightest of minds beyond the Sleepers. The altar has sent out energy waves for some time now but only recently the Sleepers noticed that the intervals are getting shorter and the waves stronger. And now they all have gathered for a meeting since they have come to the conclusion that on day x when the waves will come so fast that the simple dwarf can’t see the time between them the altar might blow up and destroy a substantial part of our hold."
 verkaldromak.67.a:0 "Maybe we need a special tool to operate it."
 verkaldromak.67.b:0 "Maybe the altar is incomplete and lacks some function."
 verkaldromak.67.c:0 "Maybe we need to use more energy impulses from the outside to break the waves."

 verkaldromak.68.t:0 "How to Handle your Tool"
 verkaldromak.68.d:0 "Further inspection of the altar reveals what we are looking for. It was indeed a tool to safely operate the energy source inside the altar. There was even a pictogram showing what we needed all along though no one was able to interpret it until now. We now need to search all sources of Precursor relics to find a device that matches the inscription. Whether the nations will give us access or not."
 verkaldromak.68.a:0 "The search for a special tool has started. New decisions are now available."

 verkaldromak.69.t:0 "Ride the Last Wave"
 verkaldromak.69.d:0 "The intervals for the energy waves have gone down to the minutes over the last few days and everyone is anxiously waiting for diplomats, merchants or spys to return with what they were searching for. There were a lot of tries but nothing matched what we needed.\n\nBut it was futile as the waves finally merged into one big tsunami. It sounds like the stone of the hold itself starts to scream as suddenly a giant part of the lower levels and the altar disappear into nothing and only a giant empty sphere remains.\n\nBut the wave did not only take away it also left behind vibrating energy in the hold, the hundreds of incompatible relics and in the minds of the Sleepers. Enough to work with for centuries."
 verkaldromak.69.a:0 "This isn’t merely an end but a new beginning!"

 verkaldromak.70.t:0 "I Rest my Case"
 verkaldromak.70.d:0 "Finally we found what we needed and got controlled access to the energy flowing inside the machine. In minutes the Sleepers were able to get rid of the overcharge waves and created a stable sphere around the altar and as by product creating a calming mesmerizing low humming one could not only hear but feel in body and mind. Now it was almost trivial to construct the old perfect bed upon the altar."
 verkaldromak.70.a:0 "We can rest now!"

 # Disaster

 verkaldromak.170.t:0 "Capture of a Resistance Nest"
 verkaldromak.170.d:0 "Some of the enemy mages have barricaded themselves in a guard tower, and are giving our troops quite a fight. After heavy losses, our soldiers are able to storm it, but several mages have been taken prisoner - what should be done with them?"
 verkaldromak.170.a:0 "They are enemies of the state - off with their heads."
 verkaldromak.170.b:0 "Let’s see if they can be ransomed..."

 verkaldromak.171.t:0 "Monuments of Old"
 verkaldromak.171.d:0 "The old tower of the mage’s guild stands as a monument to their might and majesty - and to many of the commoners, greed. Crowds are gathering to tear it down, but we may yet intervene."
 verkaldromak.171.a:0 "All traces of the traitorous guild should be torn down - allow them to proceed."
 verkaldromak.171.b:0 "Intervene - its occupants are gone, and the structure may now be put to better use"

 verkaldromak.172.t:0 "Runners on the Rails"
 verkaldromak.172.d:0 "A group of mages were caught on the old Dwarovar rails, attempting to flee the capital. They stood little chance in the tight halls of train-cars, and had nowhere to escape once discovered. What should we do with them?"
 verkaldromak.172.a:0 "We must not allow them to escape and potentially regroup - slay them."
 verkaldromak.172.b:0 "Let the cowards flee, but seize their belongings."

 verkaldromak.173.t:0 "Counter-Revolutionaries Rise Up"
 verkaldromak.173.d:0 "Whether they are followers of the previous ruler, mage-sympathizers, or just plain old opportunists, there are those who have raised their arms against us."
 verkaldromak.173.a:0 "Die, rebel scum!"

 verkaldromak.177.t:0 "Power Reclaimed"
 verkaldromak.177.d:0 "Despite all our efforts and initial momentum in the conflict, the mages have proven insurmountable. After months of brutal street fighting, they retook the academy, stormed the palace, and began to round up sleepers for mass execution. So long as the guild maintains its authority, sleepers shall never be free."
 verkaldromak.177.a:0 "The remaining Sleepers have gone into hiding, for now..."

 verkaldromak.71.a:0 "First candidate"
 verkaldromak.71.b:0 "Second candidate"
 verkaldromak.71.c:0 "Third candidate"

 verkaldromak.72.t:0 "Productivity Increased"
 verkaldromak.72.d:0 "Our recent decision to shorten the general workday has, despite our experts’ warnings, seemed to actually increase the productivity of our holds. Most attribute this to the mysterious arts of the Sleepers, while some fringe thinkers claim it is a natural improvement in motivation as a result of easier conditions."
 verkaldromak.72.a:0 "A welcome boon, to be sure."

 verkaldromak.150.t:0 "It’s a Match"
 verkaldromak.150.d:0 "Our spies have returned bringing with them a bunch of relics that more or less match the description from the altar. The Sleepers go to work immediately and indeed we got lucky as one relic reacts to the altar."

 verkaldromak.151.t:0 "Not Today"
 verkaldromak.151.d:0 "Our spies have returned bringing with them a bunch of relics that more or less match the description from the altar. The Sleepers go to work immediately and try every relic thoroughly but none interacts with the altar."

 verkaldromak.152.t:0 "Diplomacy is the Solution"
 verkaldromak.152.d:0 "Our diplomatic mission returns with their bought relics that more or less match the description from the altar. The Sleepers go to work immediately and indeed we got lucky as one relic reacts to the altar."

 verkaldromak.74.d:0 "As ruler, it’s [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s duty to guide the nation into a bright future of wealth and prosperity. But the way into such a future is long, hard, and full of dangers for our people.\n\nSince [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a Sleeper, the flow of time within dreams does not match the flower of time outside them. They have decided that it is time to go into a long sleep, spending years in the dream world whilst only passing a week outside, to seek the dangers of the coming months."

 verkaldromak.76.d:0 "It’s been days/weeks/months since [Root.Monarch.GetName] went to sleep, trying to pierce the veil of time and reality. Guards stood at their bed through all this time, aides attentive and ready to scribble down knowledge gained the moment [Root.Monarch.GetName] would open their eyes. Some sheets are already filled with cryptic incoherent sentences mumbled in one of their wilder dreams, ready to be filled with sense.\n\nAnd today is finally the day for which they all waited so long.

 verkaldromak.79.d:0 "The order is given, and today you will die. The Emperor stands ahead and to the side of you, for the first and last time. His eyes meet yours for a moment as he looks around the room, you swear he wanted to say something, but he doesn’t. The door is breaking, you can feel it. The Emperor is first to act,his hands waving and fingers contorting swiftly as you feel the room fill with a burst of sky-peeling fulmination. You close your eyes and cover your ears as you feel the air shudder and heat, just in time. And so it begins, a dozen black darts spring into being, a thousand pin-pricks of light careen toward the doorway, and you hold your staff high, seven men turning to bones and dust. But you are already dead.\n\nHigh stands the tower, glowing and white against the red sun like a spine exposed. Quickly the knights climb, high plumage and heavy steel, the marks of old commanders and ancient bloodlines. You are amongst them now. Screaming, shouting as the throng climbs the outward steps, rats to the corpse. Something falls from high above to dash among the rocks, white and now red, you swear you heard screaming.\n\nSplinters scratch you, sent flying by the shuddering strength of your ram against his final door. You are high in the tower now. A strange moment of peace as your men hold fast. The water glitters some few miles away, casting a beautiful reflection, of the white, and of the red. You turn back toward the door as you hear a brief commotion. Then you smell it, a strangely fresh smell. Then you feel it, a raising of your hairs all along your body. Then you all realize too late, light peels from nowhere and thunder crashes. The door is gone, the ram is gone, and you are falling, falling far below, now dead and charred."

 verkaldromak.80.d:0 "The dream begins in the skies above a vast land, brown but shot through with two great streaks of green. But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s vision moves quickly, away from the cities that glitter like jewels on those strings of green, and to a vast expanse of brown and yellow.\n\nCloser, faster. To a splotch of black on that dun background, which grows and grows as the vision nears. But the catch of light on steel renders the mass in a starkly different term — not some splotch like ink on parchment, but a mass of bodies, motionless, staring towards their center.\n\nTowards which the vision then proceeds. A huddling man, dismounted from a small convoy of horses, approaches a kneeling figure. A glint of bright gold metal off the object in his hands, as the — messenger? emissary? priest? — places it on the bowed head in front of him.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, an explosion of sound. Sufficient to shock [Root.Monarch.GetName], startling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] briefly awake, with a word still ringing in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ears.."

The first, a human--clothed in robe and plate, steps upon the aetherial, as if climbing a stair. The second, a harpy--bobs up and down in the rhythm of her wings. Swords slither from their scabbards, battle cries ring out, and then the duel begins. \n\nThe harpy is the faster and strikes from all directions, but the man is clever--deflecting blow after blow. slash, parry, thrust, counter-thrust--through the sounds of struggle, the sword-song pitches feverishly. Blades warble their deadly notes, accented only by the ringing of steel striking steel. And then it is over. \n\nWith a sharp exhale the human drops his blade, tumbling through the open air. He collapses onto his back, his enchanted cuirass alight with magical flame, desperate to keep him afloat. His blood flows down to the earth in long sheets, as if from the wounded sun. \n\nYou see through his eyes. Hatred. Such hatred and sadness as the windy current carries you away. First from the gleaming eyes of the harpy, then the blue and grey and green of the world, "

 verkaldromak.82.d:0 "Torches light the wretched swamp beneath you, the water glimmering faintly. You kneel in the mire, while black figures watch attentively. You lift your head for a final glance, their skin is dark and slimy, rugged from many scars. You know you won't survive. Your final glimpse catches their faces, their jaws are elongated with multiple rows of teeth. The sound from their maws is incomprehensible but rhythmic. One notices as you jolt your head towards the ground, but it is too late, your head is grasped to face a woman kneeling in the water. All you feel is anguish. A blade pierces her body, dislodging as she is kicked into the black water.\n\nYou know her, she was important, yet her lifeless body sinks, just another trivial sacrifice. The creatures cheer, gargling and beckoning something beyond the abyss. There is something down there. Something horrific. You swear you feel rumbling, but the mire is still. Dread. Your fate is sealed. Your reflection in the water is grim, warped by tears causing small ripples. This is the end. A few of the creatures face toward you, proudly displaying the power they have over you. You are next.\n\nThe world is silent around you, but you hear the faint hum of an insect landing on your body, it is insignificant, just like you are now. The water turns red beneath you as you feel the force plunging you into the depths. You see something in the abyss. A large eyelid opens, revealing a crimson eye. "

All you can remember is the moment you lost your life to someone else. You may still be living, but it wasn’t yours to act out. These chains are the strings of a puppet.\n\nThen, the day breaks. Your eyes peel open to find that you are in the midst of a battle. Metal clashing, blood flowing, bodies falling silent to the bare earth. You see your own men dragged along to serve the puppeteers' will. Still in a daze, mind confused, you rise to your feet, standing tall on the battlefield. Everyone’s gaze turns to you, the mighty king. The worldly tether has been broken, and your life returns. This purposeless war needs to end. Using your words instead of a sword, you manage to quell the beast inside every soldier, every general, and every king on the hill. Finally, you receive clarity. There are no more strings attached to you.\n\nJust as quickly as it is given, freedom can also be taken. A puppet master without puppets is a king without his vassals. Without you as his figurehead, the mages' plans lay bare for all to see. You feel a chill up your spine, an imminent threat approaching. On the battle’s fringe, a sorcerer lurks, hidden in shadows. Demons and devils reach out their hands, and shackles prepare to bind you once more. Your vision fades between light and dark. As you are dragged down to the depths of your mind the light turns to nothing but flickers. You remember clarity. You must resist, you must fight against the shadows. Your mind is the battle, you, the soldier, and while it looks like a losing cause, you must persevere. His presence draws near, more ominous, ever more powerful. The sorcerer stands upon a fortress, the very essence of his being is felt by everyone in the swamp. Once again, you are faced with eternal shadows. The battle is lost, but you will not accept another eon in the depths of your mind, locked away. With blade in hand, you raise it high above your chest, and prepare to end this pointless war. The long-sought clarity arrives, as the sorcerer looks on in shock, and soldiers rush to your aid. "

You heft the bundle of poultices and tinctures you are carrying under your arm, and push open the door to your shared home with your hip. When you call out and hear no response, you drop what you are holding and rush into the bedroom. Her eyes are closed, but you can still see the rise and fall of her chest as she breathes: just sleeping then. You exhale a relieved sigh, and pull the cloth, almost hot with sickness, from her forehead, replacing it with another you prepared ahead of time, and sit down next to her. \n\nShe opens her mouth, as though to speak, and you lean in close to listen, but the sound that comes out is a wet rattle, and then nothing. You do not realize you are holding your own breath until it comes out as a soft sob, weeks worth of worry and grief slipping through the sieve of your fingers over your face as tears stain the sheets you once shared. Never again will you see the way one corner of her lip turns up when you make a bad joke, or the way she hops over the threshold of your door.\n\nAnd then you feel the sheets rustling. Startled, you open your eyes, and see hers are open too, the light that once lit them replaced with dull embers, a campfire not yet ready to go out. She reaches up for your face, and you are only too glad for the touch, her fingers still warm with fever. She lurches up towards you, teeth bared in a rictus snarl."

Time has fallen away from us, the sky has receded, and all the walls and wars of Dwarovar clamor for a newly birthed Heaven. \n\nOn the first day it arrived at our city. An omen of light and shadow that served to make the darkness of our underground all the more stark. Some took it as an omen of Death, others of Light and Life. As astrologers, we took it as opportunity. \n\nOn the third day there was no more interest. What had been rich novelty was now no more than a peculiarity for children or for the history books. Yet I could see it in their eyes, in my eyes, a wakefulness of mind and body. \n\nOn the seventh day we claimed no more pretense. Who could stand in the mines, who could stay in the fields and the launderers, when all the weight of Darkness pressed at our sky. We turned away from mundanity. We shed our worldliness and for the next days and nights we gathered at our highest points. And we gazed with the longing of old lovers.\n\nOn the seventh day I was chosen.

Large teeth, engraved bones and weapons on your walls and quaint furs covering the floor, the essential trophies for a simple hunter.\n\nYou decide to leave the room equipped with your bow, yet as you step outside you see a giant ice palace perched on the mountains. The grandeur presents power but also much arrogance. As you admire the palace, large creatures begin to fly towards it, your sense of reality shatters. The largest entities you have ever seen sweep across the sky urgently. The Dragons have arrived.\n\nThey however pay no heed towards you and hover around the palace, preparing something. You think to run away but are entranced by the convergence that has appeared before your eyes. The Dragons begin to breathe fire upon the palace, many streams of colour dismantling the great structure. You thought you were powerful but this is beyond you, the power of the dragons surpassed you. Your eyes show fear nobody thought possible as the glaciers fall apart and melt, flooding the valley before you. As you begin to run, a voice calls to you from the sky."

Magic roams through the air, guiding the soldiers along an endless quest to a target unknown. As you peer out into the wide grassy flatlands that lay ahead, you spot a unique structure: a large temple, gilded and glimmering. The men walked towards the temple, their numbers now clearly in the hundreds. \n\nThe black armor of the soldiers met the bright light of the monks, the raging demeanor fights the calm voices, who try to send the men away. The storm breaks through, and takes away the serenity, replacing it with chaos. \n\nOnly a few minutes after entry, the knights have already slaughtered the monks, as you watch on. Their lust for power was clear, but to leave now may mean risking the same fate as the calm against the rabid. Thus, they begin their rites as the sun sets, descending further into darkness, preaching mantras of newfound power. The descent from floor to floor, sees a gradual progression from artworks divine to rotting corpses and an intense stench of heresy. The floor at the bottom is pitch black, with the wall depicting some sort of divine figure now etched and destroyed, replaced with hellish marks. In the middle of this room lay a coffin, bound by chains and surrounded by holy relics. Evil emanates from the casket, its force seductive, perverting the minds of all with promises of power and glory. One man steps forward, and uses his magic to break the chains of the coffin. \n\nA storm of shadows and dust erupts, engulfing the room. Men around you are butchered and slaughtered, with their corpses seemingly dried up like raisins. Not a single drop of blood had fallen, yet almost everyone in the room now lies dead on the floor. In the middle of the room, stands the presence of what felt to be a form of evil incarnate. She looks at you, eyes red and wide open, and says with a resounding voice, ‘You, who has freed me from my eternal slumber, I offer you and your friends a gift you cannot refuse. I shall give you all a chance at eternal life, and power beyond mortality.”"

The day is serene, a beautiful peace settling over the hills. Then comes the first noise, a hoof beating against the ground. Then came another, a dozen- no, hundreds more. Creatures of all shape and size race by in a frenzy, not running towards, but running away. The peace is shattered by this confusion of animals, racing by the sleeper, with each one seeming to barely avoid trampling them. As if in fear of being left behind, swarms of birds blot out the sky in their escape, darkening the landscape. As the last of the beasts pass by, the sleeper is left alone in their wake of destruction, a number of beasts unfortunate enough to be injured in the stampede, still struggling to get away at all costs. Almost on instinct, the sleeper's gaze is drawn to the sky where some form of comet, or other blazing object seems to trail across. Faster, and faster. The warm air climbs to blistering as the object aims for distant mountains. Its size monolithic to say the least. The ground trembles in fear, shaking the sleeper's bones as the heat threatens to melt their very flesh. Finally, the object drops behind the mountains, vanishing for a brief second. A calm. Then a flash. The sleeper awakens, diving out of their bed to grasp at the cool floor, ensuring it's still there."
