 flavor_trompolere.4.t:0 "Alaran's Death"
 flavor_trompolere.4.d:0 "Lord Alaran has always been brave and defiant in the face of overwhelming odds, however today that proved his undoing, as he charged into [From.GetAdjective] lines where he met his end! With his death the Trompolerey army is left without a clear leadership, and as they hastily march back home, already neighbouring lords are declaring our previous treaties invalid, and sending troops on our borders to take back the land we had conquered from them."
