 flavor_trompolere.0.d:0 "Our young Lord, Alaran, has triumphed against all odds against the armies of Fadhevych, Arverynn and Stanyrhrada, defeating one foe after another and claiming Arverynn's treasury as his prize. While our borders have more than tripled in size and many of our levies would love to return to their fields, Alaran is far from satisfied, and in this very moment he's marching towards the castle of Vels Bacar, the gateway to the north."
 flavor_trompolere.0.a:0 "Onwards, to Vels Bacar!"
 flavor_trompolere.0.b:0 "Alaran is too dangerous. Dispose of him"
 
 flavor_trompolere.1.t:0 "Trompolere Leader Slain"
 flavor_trompolere.1.d:0 "We have slain lord Alaran of Trompolere! His death without a worthy heir will lead to the undoing of all of his conquests, as already troops from neighbouring lords are marching in to seize back their land he had taken from them."

 flavor_trompolere.4.t:0 "Alaran's Death"
 flavor_trompolere.4.d:0 "Lord Alaran has always been brave and defiant in the face of overwhelming odds, however today that proved his undoing, as he charged into [From.GetAdjective] lines where he met his end! With his death the Trompolerey army is left without a clear leadership, and as they hastily march back home, already neighbouring lords are declaring our previous treaties invalid, and sending troops on our borders to take back the land we had conquered from them."

 flavor_trompolere.7.a:0 "We merely gained a new overlord."
