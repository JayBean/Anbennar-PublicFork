    G59_hunting_pearls_title:0 "Hunting Pearls"
    G59_hunting_pearls_desc:0 " Anisíkheion was founded by Kherkan pearl hunters as a base of operations. While we have long since moved past those early days, much of our population still partakes in the practice. Recently, our pearl hunters have found signs of significant quantities of pearls off the coast of the islands of Agonisí, Anikhein, and Proylasí. This is a great opportunity to breathe new life into these once quiet isles by investing in infrastructure for our pearl hunters on these islands."
    G59_expanding_fleet_facilities_title:0 "Expanding Fleet Facilities"
    G59_expanding_fleet_facilities_desc:0 "As our control of the seas grows, so too must our fleet. Unfortunately, we do not currently have the infrastructure to support the fleet we need. Our admirals have proposed a massive building project across our territories to remedy this issue. Our engineers have also proposed the construction of a great naval arsenal upon the island of Anisíkheion. The costs may be great, but the results will be worth it."
    G59_inviting_kheionai_diplomats_title:0 "Invite Diplomats"
    G59_inviting_kheionai_diplomats_desc:0 "As our city grows even more than anyone could imagine, we are starting to gain attention from the Alecandi kheions who had for so long overlooked us. Our city is by size alone just as great as theirs, but if we invite their diplomats to our city, it could be shown in beauty as well. Let us invite them to our great city, and let them spread stories of our city’s grandeur upon their return!"
    #2nd Column
    G59_invest_in_our_city_title:0 "Invest In Our City"
    G59_invest_in_our_city_desc:0 "When we were chained to our parent city, Kherka, we never had much room to grow. Our economy was entirely dependent on feeding Kherka, and the only people who moved here were convicts and exiles sent away from Kherka. With us now being independent and free, it is about time we invested our new found surplus wealth into growing our city into one able to rival those of Alecand."
    G59_a_great_kheion_title:0 "A Great Kheion"
    G59_a_great_kheion_desc:0 "Our glorious city has only barely eclipsed those of Alecand, but it still has so much room for further improvement. Our sailors call for improved dockyard infrastructure, more housing needs to be built, and so much more. We shall invest more into our city than ever before, for we should not stop at being merely "equal" to the great kheions!"
    G59_the_greatest_kheion_title:0 "The Greatest Kheion"
    G59_the_greatest_kheion_desc:0 "Even the poorest of Anisíkheion’s residents are as wealthy as the average resident of the other kheions, for we are not just superior in terms of size, but in wealth as well. Even with all our progress, there is still so much potential. We will create the greatest, most beautiful city, the greatest of the Kheionai!"
    G59_develop_the_southern_islands_title:0 "Develop The Home Isles"
    G59_develop_the_southern_islands_desc:0 "While Anisíkheion’s growth and success has made our citizens very wealthy, it has made the residents of our other islands envious and resentful. Representatives from these overlooked islands call for investments to be made, so they too can partake in our success."
    G59_kheions_of_the_sea_title:0 "Kheions Of The Sea"
    G59_kheions_of_the_sea_desc:0 "Our recent investments into our island territories have paid off greatly, with these islands hosting new, growing cities with just as much potential as Anisíkheion had. Interestingly enough, these new cities are also host to increasing immigration from Alecand, as a way to escape the increasingly powerful deathwinds. It is time we invest even more into these new cities, for success breeds more success."
    G59_show_them_reality_title:0 "Show Them Reality"
    G59_show_them_reality_desc:0 "The great kheions refuse to see our greatness, and insult our diplomats, considering us mere upstarts. We will not let this stand. Maybe blockading their ports will make them see reality!"
    G59_subjugate_the_great_kheions_title:0 "Subjugate The Great Kheions"
    G59_subjugate_the_great_kheions_desc:0 "It is from the great kheions that our civilization first emerged, and if we want to proclaim ourselves the greatest of the Kheionai, we will have to subjugate these cities. Once we have become their overlords, they will no longer be able to dismiss us, and no one can dare ignore our place in the sun, as the greatest of the Kheionai."
    #3rd Column
    G59_kherkan_overreach_title:0 "Kherkan Overreach"
    G59_kherkan_overreach_desc:0 "Ever since our founding generations ago, we have sat comfortably under the protection of our Kherkan overlords. They granted us much autonomy in return for handling our foreign affairs. Recently, however, the Kherkan state has been trying to gain increasing control over our state, in a potential attempt to annex us. We will not let this happen. It’s about time we break free from our parent city, and guarantee our future."
    G59_consolidate_the_southern_cleaved_sea_title:0 "Consolidate The South Sea"
    G59_consolidate_the_southern_cleaved_sea_desc:0 "Our newfound freedom has led to great benefits, but even greater risks. The southern Cleaved Sea is our rightful sea, yet many of its islands are controlled by foreign, potentially hostile powers. Many influential members of our republic, including the admiralty and merchants, want to see the southern Cleaved Sea under our control. Let us seize the south for ourselves!"
    G59_scouting_volthlisi_title:0 "Scouting Vothelisí"
    G59_scouting_volthlisi_desc:0 "In the middle of The Cleaved Sea lies the Vothelisí islands. It is the last remnant of a land bridge that once connected Alecand to the mainland. While this fact is interesting enough on its own, the islands also serve as a barrier, a wall dividing The Cleaved Sea in two. Whoever controls the Vothelisí islands controls the trade through The Cleaved Sea. This fact alone has led to our merchants calling for us to seize the islands. Our admiralty too are supportive of this, fearful of the security implications of these islands falling into the hands of an enemy.\n\nWe shall send scouts to the area to poke at its weaknesses, for potential holes in its defenses. We must be prepared, for the states that hold these islands won’t give them up without a fight."
    G59_extracting_tolls_title:0 "Extracting Tolls"
    G59_extracting_tolls_desc:0 "Our conquest of the Vothelisí islands has already led to great benefits for us. We control The Cleaved Sea, now it’s time to exploit this. We shall build a series of tolls that everyone must pay to sail past these islands."
    G59_expanding_the_admiraltys_authority_title:0 "Expand Naval Authority"
    G59_expanding_the_admiraltys_authority_desc:0 "We do not have total control of The Cleaved Sea yet, for the northern islands still lay outside of our reach for now. What's more of an issue, however, is the amount of smugglers that have risen up to bypass our tolls. These slippery bastards know how to avoid our tolls, or just bribe our officials to get around them. Our admiralty has proposed that they take control of the tolls, and with it the responsibility of stopping any smugglers that may try to get past them."
    G59_all_your_islands_are_belong_to_us_title:0 "All Islands Belong To Us"
    G59_all_your_islands_are_belong_to_us_desc:0 "We shall own all the islands of The Cleaved Sea, for with the islands come total domination of the trade that runs through it!"
    G59_the_admirals_coup_title:0 "The Admiral's Coup"
    G59_the_admirals_coup_desc:0 "Since the independence of our nation, we have been relying on the admiralty to serve as our means of projecting power. We have been focusing on improving our navy, with it becoming a powerful influence within the republic. The citizens themselves have begun to notice the increasing authority of the navy over the nation. But today, the Kylakas in Anisikheion was given a visit by the Grand Admiral, a very prominent figure in the nation by now, and his men..."
    G59_the_great_proclamation_title:0 "The Great Proclamation"
    G59_the_great_proclamation_desc:0 "While many have noticed our greatness and have acknowledged it, it seems the Alecandi have not. Alecandi diplomats seem to dismiss us as island yokels with a massive fleet, somehow uncultured by their standards. It seems we will have to be very direct with them, and so the Grand Admiral has prepared a speech to be delivered in front of a massive crowd in the center of Anisíkheion today…"
    G59_monopolize_the_cleaved_sea_title:0 "Dominating Trade"
    G59_monopolize_the_cleaved_sea_desc:0 "Our position as the unrivaled hegemon of The Cleaved Sea has given us many options when dealing with our enemies. It’s time then, we bring out one of our harsher policies upon them. All merchants will have to be registered with Anisíkheion if they want to sail in our waters. If they aren’t, they will be considered smugglers and their ships will be seized. Not only will this cut off trade to any nation in The Cleaved Sea who dare oppose our rule, it will also give us access to an even greater amount of wealth!"
    G59_the_8th_great_kheion_title:0 "The 8th Great Kheion"
    G59_the_8th_great_kheion_desc:0 "We have come far from our humble origins. We have become great and powerful! Our city: the greatest the Kheionai have ever seen. Our navy: the greatest this side of Aelantir. Our power: unchallenged. Our wealth: unmatched."
    #4th Column
    G59_pirates_to_the_east_title:0 "Pirates To The East"
    G59_pirates_to_the_east_desc:0 "Much of our state’s revenue comes from the toll the merchants traveling through the passage must pay to enter our waters. It was always a stable source of revenue, and could be relied on…And then the corsairs appeared. In hindsight, the southern passage was always vulnerable to piracy, but only now had that threat become realized.\n\nOur scouts report that these pirates operate out of the newly independent kheion of Amgremós, and that they have the unofficial support of the state of Amgremós. Officially, Amgremós denies their collaboration with the corsairs, although we know the truth. We shall send spies into Amgremós in order to gather the evidence needed to prove their collaboration with the pirates. With this evidence, we will have a valid case for war, and no one will try and intervene to stop us from bringing this rogue kheion to justice!"
    G59_expanding_the_fleet_title:0 "Expanding The Fleet"
    G59_expanding_the_fleet_desc:0 "To achieve our goal of dominating the cleaved sea, we will need a fleet bigger that shall always be bigger than those possessed by our enemies. All it takes is one catastrophic lost naval battle to bring Anisíkheion to ruin…We shall build enough ships to make sure this possibility never occurs!"
    G59_growth_of_southern_trading_title:0 "Increased Passage Traffic"
    G59_growth_of_southern_trading_desc:0 "With the closing of the port of Amgremós to the corsairs, the threat of piracy in the passage has been almost wiped out. This has led to a boom in merchant shipping traffic sailing through the passage, something that benefits us directly."
    G59_protecting_the_merchants_title:0 "Protecting The Merchants"
    G59_protecting_the_merchants_desc:0 "The passage is still vulnerable to attacks, even with Amgremós being closed to pirates. Small time raiders, barbarians, and others still on occasion attack merchant shipping along this vital route. We shall build a large escort fleet to protect these merchant vessels, the tolls they pay will more than offset the cost of maintenance."
    G59_the_route_secured_title:0 "The Route Secured"
    G59_the_route_secured_desc:0 "With our escort fleet sailing the entire length of the trade route, we have become known far and wide as the protectors of the merchants. From Orenkoraim to Degakheion, our escort ships are found, keeping the trade route open, free of any potential attack. It is about time, then, that we exploit this influence to secure as much influence for our own merchants as possible."
    G59_our_own_nekheis_title:0 "Our Own Nékheis"
    G59_our_own_nekheis_desc:0 "We were once another nékheis among many, our only distinguishing trait being our island based geography. We have come a long way from that dreadful time, and it is helpful that our cousins see the truth of our greatness far more clearly than the Alecandi do. Our diplomats have presented a proposal to The Grand Admiral, to send an offer to our cousins, offering them our "protection". While the idea of having a nékheis of our own has never really been a goal of Anisíkheion, the other Alecandi have nékheis, and we don’t. It's about time this should be rectified."
    G59_secure_the_coastal_mainland_title:0 "Secure The Devandi Coast"
    G59_secure_the_coastal_mainland_desc:0 "With the acquisition of our own nékheis, we finally have the means to deal with the one threat that has up until now gone untouched: the mainland. Barbarian tribes, bandits, raiders and hostile states occupy the Devandi coast. We shall secure the coastline, offer it to our nékheis to control, and thus the last threat to our hegemony will be dealt with."
    #5th Column
    G59_the_treaty_of_anisoton_title:0 "The Treaty Of Anisóton"
    G59_the_treaty_of_anisoton_desc:0 "The Amgremósi have been defeated. Their harbor has been blockaded for months, their navy is at the bottom of the sea, and their people are starting to starve. They have sent diplomats to us, begging for peace…It’s about time we ended this, peace is more profitable after all."
    G59_islands_to_the_east_title:0 "Islands To The East"
    G59_islands_to_the_east_desc:0 "We have heard from merchants who make many voyages to the east of far away islands, just off the coast of Taychend, untouched by the warlords. While they are owned by Ameion for now, they would serve as perfect naval bases for us. Let us seize these eastern islands, and with them the control of the Taychendi coastline!"
    G59_eastern_bases_title:0 "Eastern Bases"
    G59_eastern_bases_desc:0 "We have seized the eastern islands, and with it, the eastern sea is ours. Among these islands is Genthíliá, the 2nd largest among them. It has a natural harbor, perfect for building a great base of operations in the east…"

#Events
    anisikheion_events.1.t:0 "Freedom?"
    anisikheion_events.1.d:0 "With peace being made with Kherka, we are now a free nation. And unlike Amgremós, we became free by our own strength. The great kheions are not as powerful as they seem, and can be beaten in war. No doubt the other nékheis are watching, hoping to follow our example soon.\n\nThere were certain…compromises we had to make in order to secure our freedom. Not least of which being the increased influence the navy has gained. While we are still a republic, the navy has gained an inordinate amount of influence, something that many in the government fear will only grow as time goes on.\n\nOur population has at best mixed feelings about our independence. They have been used to the security our overlord brought, and are fearful that another state may attack us. Conversely, those serving in the navy are ecstatic at the possibilities that lie ahead. If nothing else could be said, however, it is this: our future is in our hands alone now."
    anisikheion_events.1.a:0 "Our future secured."
    
    anisikheion_events.2.t:0 "The Question of Greatness"
    anisikheion_events.2.d:0 "An old elf named Gabras was walking through the streets of Anisíkheion. He still remembered those days, long ago, when Anisíkheion was still subjugated. When it was still a mere settlement in comparison to the greats. Over the course of his life, he had seen much change. The dockyards often sat empty back then, with many an elf using it as a convenient spot for fishing. Now it was crammed with ships, full of traffic with ships constantly entering and exiting. The streets he walked in had become far more active, with almost every good known being sold in its markets. \n\nA large hill near the outskirts could give one a view over the whole city. Gabras had climbed it often in his childhood, for it gave a most beautiful view. Gabras climbed the hill, and what he saw was astounding. The city had grown so large it stretched beyond the horizon. The climb back down was awful for Gabras’s legs, which is why he hadn’t done it in years.\n\nHe returned to his home, and had a drink with his friends, many of whom are even older than him. One of them remarked on his journey to Oktikheion a few years earlier, and how that city had become dwarfed by Anisíkheion; many others shared a similar sentiment. The most well traveled among them, who had visited all the great cities of Alecand, had the audacity to claim Anisíkheion should be called the 8th great kheion, which caused a stir, for Anisíkheion was a nékhei, not a great kheion. Yet at this point, what difference did it make? They had all seen what Anisíkheion had become. Gabras thought to himself… "

    anisikheion_events.4.t:0 "Genthíliá Island"
    anisikheion_events.4.d:0 "Our acquisition of the eastern islands has gone smoothly, with our new bases serving our needs well. Although, our admiralty complains about the lack of a main eastern base.\n\nWe have found a good location for such an installation on Genthíliá island. A large island, unreachable to anyone without a ship, and thankfully, no one had actually lived here before our settlers arrived. The island has great potential, and our engineers have drafted plans for a great eastern base.\n\n We have sent construction crews to the isle, and work has gone without any issues. Already our admiralty has sent the eastern fleet to the island, which will become its new home base. The only issue left to solve is what the base shall be named."
    anisikheion_events.4.a:0 "Keyolíman shall project our power in the east."
    
    anisikheion_events.5.t:0 "The Visit"
    anisikheion_events.5.d:0 "An excerpt of a report from a Kheionai diplomat, of his official visit to Anisíkheion:\n\nI left my ship to a most graceful entrance with marines standing guard, along a massive street with beautiful buildings along its sides. Great crowds watched me with curiosity, as the Kylakas of Anisíkheion [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self had come to accompany me. I should also note the tactical placement of a great amount of warships in my line of sight. A threat? No matter, for when I reached [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace, I was honestly quite disappointed. It was not nearly as big as I thought it would be. Every government official seems to be adorned with pearl jewelry of some kind. The Kylakas, in particular, wore some kind of crown made of pearls, which the Anisíkheioni seem to think is fashionable. My visit had, as you know, been to work out some kind of trade agreement with Anisíkheion. Instead, they took this as an opportunity to flaunt their wealth and power, as if we didn’t already know…"
    anisikheion_events.5.a:0 "A truly beautiful city."
    
    anisikheion_events.6.t:0 "The Admiral's Coup"
    anisikheion_events.6.d:0 "The takeover itself happened hastily, the soldiers secured the palace and with his own guards being in on the plan, the Kylakas had no choice but to submit. The next few hours were filled with chaos as the citizenry were not pleased with the sudden destruction of their republic. However, things settled down, with the Grand Admiral contemplating what will come next for the nation and its people."
    anisikheion_events.6.a:0 "A long time coming."
    
    anisikheion_events.7.t:0 "The New Administration"
    anisikheion_events.7.d:0 "A strange sight was beheld today by the people of Anisikheion, instead of the regular bureaucrats coming into their offices, the navy's officers and admirals were coming in. In order to solidify his position as the new head of state, the Grand Admiral made a statement to the public, saying that there is no large change to the government, and that the elections would simply be managed by the admiralty now. Although the majority of the populace accepted this statement, a minority was quite displeased with this sudden change." 
    anisikheion_events.7.a:0 "The civillians will get used to it."
    
    anisikheion_events.8.t:0 "Alecandi Humilliation"
    anisikheion_events.8.d:0 "The Grand Admiral had sent a letter to the 7 Kylakas of the Alecandi kheions, inviting them to meet with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. They could not refuse, of course. When they entered the city, they had to wait for hours on their ships, waiting for permission to enter the city. There was no grand entrance ceremony, and no guards assigned to them. They were left to themselves to find their way to the Grand Admiral’s palace. Of course, they were watched from the shadows the entire time. When they finally found their way to the palace, they were locked out, with a naval officer showing up and taking them to their barely maintained residences on the outskirts of the city. At this point, they were finally given guards, although they were tasked with preventing them from escaping rather than guarding them. Finally, after a week, the Grand Admiral granted them an audience. They were dragged towards The Grand Admiral, and made to kneel before their true superior. All of them complied, except for the Kylakas of Degakheion, who instead shouted and insulted The Grand Admiral. He was quickly beheaded after that. "You will all meet that fate if you try to rebel. Let that be a warning." After such a gruesome display, the now 6 kylakas were then quickly shuffled out of the palace, and onto their ships, back to their homeland."
    anisikheion_events.8.a:0 "A most humiliating journey."
    
    anisikheion_events.9.t:0 "Growing Authority"
    anisikheion_events.9.d:0 "At first, it wasn’t noticeable, merely a small sacrifice to gain independence. But it seems that the navy took the inch they were given, and ran a mile. Their influence can be felt in every corner of Anisíkheion’s government, from the lowest of bureaucrats up to, and including the Kylakas himself. And now, even the citizens are beginning to notice. Marines standing guard in front of government buildings, the navy being accountable to no one, and the Grand Admiral having so much sway that he can effectively choose his Kylakas. While on paper the state is a republic, the reality is far different."
    anisikheion_events.9.a:0 "Mere puppets."
    
    anisikheion_events.10.t:0 "The Great Proclamation"
    anisikheion_events.10.d:0 ""For generations, we have remained a backwater, chained to a kheion that never cared for our existence. Our ancestors broke that chain, yet we were still not treated well by the other kheions. Our navy led the charge on expanding our power and wealth, but still we were disrespected. Our city grew to become larger than anything the original 7 had seen. Our wealth dwarfed theirs, our navy greater than anything they had seen. Yet still, we were disrespected. It seems then, that we will have to be very direct with not just our cousins in the other nékheis, but also towards our equals. WE ARE the 8th great kheion, and we demand to be treated as such. If they refuse, even now, they will be destroyed, we will make sure of it."\n\nThe large crowd that had come to listen to The Grand Admiral’s speech cheered ecstatically, while those in the crowd of Alecandi origins grew fearful of what would happen to their home kheions."
    anisikheion_events.10.a:0 "A historic statement."
    
    anisikheion_events.11.t:0 "Response of the Nékheis"
    anisikheion_events.11.d:0 "The nékheis seem very accepting of our statement, and have begun treating us as we deserve. Their diplomats treat the Grand Admiral with respect and admiration, the leader of a nékhei that became equal to the great kheions in status. Already we have begun negotiating treaties with many of the nékheis, and it seems our relations with our cousins have improved greatly."
    anisikheion_events.11.a:0 "Great!"
    
    anisikheion_events.12.t:0 "Response of Our Equals"
    anisikheion_events.12.d:0 "The great kheions have not received our proclamation well, and seem wholly unconvinced of our greatness. The few that did send their messengers came with responses of an insulting demeanor, with one diplomat from a certain Degakheion having the gaul to spit on our Grand Admiral! Those that didn’t send responses simply closed their ports to our merchants, and barred entry to our diplomats. It seems clear that our equals aren’t gonna play nice. Already our admirals are planning how best to respond, almost all of them recommend §Rwar§!."
    anisikheion_events.12.a:0 "They. Will. Pay!"
    
    anisikheion_events.13.t:0 "Were It Not For The Navy"
    anisikheion_events.13.d:0 "$MONARCH$ looks out from the balcony of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] great palace, overlooking Anisíkheion’s great harbor. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sees a most glorious sight. Hundreds of warships anchored in port, the greatest navy Aelantir has ever seen. $MONARCH$ reminisces about Anisíkheion’s rise, for it is a story of Anisíkheion’s navy. Were it not for its navy, it would still be a backwater island settlement. Were it not for the navy, Anisíkheion would still be dominated by disloyal merchants and land lovers. Were it not for the navy, Anisíkheion would not have become the 8th great kheion, able to challenge and ultimately subjugate the other great kheions. $MONARCH$ snaps out of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] thoughts, and returns inside to a meeting with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] admirals, for there are always more threats across the sea, not least of which being these so called "Cannorian'' newcomers. But whatever happens going forward, the navy has given Anisíkheion a place in the sun, one that it will defend to the last ship."
    anisikheion_events.13.a:0 "A bright future ahead."
    
    anisikheion_events.14.t:0 "Offer of Protection"
    anisikheion_events.14.d:0 "We have received a proposal from The Grand Admiral of Anisíkheion. They ask for a closer partnership, wishing to handle our foreign affairs in exchange for eternal protection. It seems Anisikheion has become a great kheion in its actions too, for It’s not hard to see the threat in this message. If we reject they will surely invade."
    anisikheion_events.14.a:0 "Accept the offer, it is neccessary."
    anisikheion_events.14.b:0 "We refuse to become subjugated once more."
