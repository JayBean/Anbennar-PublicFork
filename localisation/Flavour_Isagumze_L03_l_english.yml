 L03_isagumze_rally_the_kulugi_abe_desc:0 "The Kulugi Abe, the traditional nobility of Isagumze, have sensed an opportunity to expand their influence and improve their position against their rivals in the Medawor and the less traditionalist Efergezmu. Some of the most powerful Kulugi Abe families have approached the state, offering to lend us significant support for our coming wars, which could prove extremely useful. Of course, they ask for some small concessions in exchange."

 L03_isagumze_establish_wrestling_arenas_desc:0 "One of the most important traditions of the Kulugi Abe is that of ritualized wrestling. New arenas are built on top of the graves of mighty warriors. The belief is that any disputes can be solved via wrestling bouts, with the winner chosen by our deceased ancestors. To further strengthen our ties with the Kulugi Abe, we will build new wrestling arenas in our land and encourage the adoption of the tradition by more of our population. The greatest of these new arenas will stand on top of the grave of our late ruler, the venerable Saban Alangba."

Most of our current generals are already pulled from their ranks, and they now wish to have a monopoly on leadership in the army. This will please them and strengthen their position, and in exchange we will benefit from their martial expertise."

 L03_isagumze_restarting_the_sacred_war_desc:0 "Kheterata has failed us! We bent the knee to the Stewards hoping they would provide support for our sacred war against the lizardfolk. Instead we have spent decades stagnant, content with defending our current borders, instead of following Nyokyora’s example and carrying the war to the lizards. It is time to change that! Our Medaka has decreed that the brave warriors of the Ikilshebe will march again against the reptiles, and this time nothing will stop us until we triumph and make Nyokyora proud! We will ready our forces and start by crushing the few reptiles that still linger inside our borders, sending a clear message to their brethren in the east."

 L03_isagumze_crush_the_warring_reptiles_desc:0 "Clearly Nyokyora has blessed us! Just as we turn our conquering gaze towards the east, the lizards in our borders start a brutal war against each other. Our old foes in Karassk are desperately clinging to their faded empire and trying to resist the attacks of the kingdom of Asarta, led by an ambitious scion of the Riverclaw dynasty. The latter seems to be seeking to gather strength so he can surpass, and possibly betray, his brother in Rayaz. This is the perfect time to strike! With a swift attack we will crush both of them, raze the ancient city of Karassk, and make a glorious suit of armor out of the Riverclaw would-be emperor."

 L03_isagumze_cleansing_the_coast_desc:0 "The coastal jungle of Bivirir has long resisted human settlement, infested as it is with savage lizardfolk tribes. It is time to change this. We will crush these tribes once and for all and turn Bivirir into an integral part of Isagumze. The Kulugi Abe have already offered to support the colonization efforts in exchange for ownership of the newly gained lands."

So glorious were His feats that he ascended to the heavens, and became the new god of war. In His honor and His name, we have a duty to bring war to the lizardfolk. Make Sarhal fear and worship the name of blessed Nyokyora!"
 L03_isagumze_following_his_steps_title:0 "Following His Steps"
 L03_isagumze_following_his_steps_desc:0 "No tale is more repeated by the Ikilshebe Griots than that of Nyokyora expedition against the lizardfolk, where He slayed thousands of lizards and returned home with mountains of plunder and scale armors. The path of this expedition followed the coast, crossing and sacking the swamps of Khugra, then an irrelevant small town. We must follow His path and recreate His feats, this time establishing a firm and permanent rule over the conquered lands. The griots wish to tear down the shrine at the center of Khugra and turn it into a temple to the great heroes of the Irsukuba people - a place for song and theater upon the rubble of our foes - as well as being granted rights to administer the city."
 L03_isagumze_his_farthest_reach_title:0 "His Farthest Reach"
 L03_isagumze_his_farthest_reach_desc:0 "The city of Nazhni, the farthest reach of Nyokyora, is finally within our grasp. To finally seize it, we need only to crush the shady lizards that currently inhabit it, a task that will pose no challenge after the great victories we have already achieved. Once we take the city and establish a secure path with the rest of our nation, pilgrims will flock to this sacred place to see the wonders the Griots’ tales talk about with their own eyes. To further signal our devotion to Nyokyora we will rename the city in His name, erasing the name of Nazhni from history."
 L03_isagumze_the_prophecy_title:0 "The Prophecy"
 L03_isagumze_the_prophecy_desc:0 "Knowledge of the unnerving prophecy of the 333rd empire has been spreading through our nation. Wisemen, scholars, and intellectuals of all kinds constantly debate and argue with each other about its meaning, its accuracy, and the possible response we could give to it. It seems we are experiencing a concentrated version of a debate that has been a constant for lizardfolk society during the last few millennia. The state must take a side in these disputes to stop the nation from descending into chaos, and the path we take now will mark the destiny of Isagumze and its people for the rest of time."
 L03_isagumze_housing_his_glory_title:0 "Housing His Glory"
 L03_isagumze_housing_his_glory_desc:0 "In the past, the plunder from the wars against the lizardfolk paid for magnificent temples to the glory of Nyokyora and beautiful statues of his mighty image. However, in our years of servitude to Kheterata, we have let them fall into disrepair. We must put an end to this indignity! As the Ikilshebe are the mightiest of Horashesh, and as our God is greater than any other, so must our temples be the most magnificent and glorious, so that they are flooded with pilgrims and offerings, as testament to our love for Nyokyora. "

 L03_isagumze_know_your_enemy_title:0 "Know Your Enemy"
 L03_isagumze_know_your_enemy_desc:0 "We have spent centuries fighting and killing lizardfolk, but as we conquer more of their land, we fall under the realization that we do not actually know too much about them. Sure, we know the best places to strike to bring them down, and we know the proper technique to flay them without damaging the skin, but their culture, history and faith remains largely a mystery for us. Many among us still think there is no reason to change that, as there is nothing these creatures can offer to us apart from their scales. However, perhaps by extensively studying their culture and history we can find better ways to kill them, or, if we are feeling merciful, to rule over them."

 L03_isagumze_support_from_the_protected_desc:0 "For centuries we have protected Horashesh, and by extension every human up north, from the lizardfolk threat. Without us every human in Sarhal would already be under the cruel yoke of the lizards. Let’s appeal to those intelligent enough to understand this, and ask them to send gold and men to fuel our campaigns. Of course we know they are too ungrateful to do this without expecting something in return, aside from the invaluable protection we already give them for free, so we will offer to repay these loans quadrupled once we have taken enough lizardfolk land to extract resources from."

 L03_isagumze_extracting_their_payment_desc:0 "The Ikilshebe always keep their word; that is something more could learn from us. We promised we would repay the contributions four-fold, and we will! The fools that doubted will soon be swallowing their words and humbly thanking us for our generosity, as they should. Of course extracting the payment will require an extensive plundering of the conquered lizardfolk, but as Nyokyora himself said, to the victor, the spoils!"

 L03_isagumze_arm_the_griots_desc:0 "The Griots are the cornerstone of the Noukahi faith. Wandering storytellers that go from a village to another, recounting the feats of our heroes and gods. It is vital that the tales and songs of the Griots are heard in every corner of our empire, so that the glory of Nyokyora is spread to new people, even to the lizardfolk if we have been generous enough to allow them to remain alive inside our borders. However, not everyone has the good sense to give the proper respect to these holy men. We will put an end to this by supplying the Griots of Isagumze with weapons and personal guards. That way they can make sure everyone in the lands they visit listens to their wise words, by force if necessary."

 L03_isagumze_a_fear_we_could_use_title:0 "A Fear We Could Use"
 L03_isagumze_a_fear_we_could_use_desc:0 "The lizardfolk still hold a great fear of dragons, it seems, steaming from the Greenblight that punished their lands eons ago. Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, a dragon recently uncovered himself somewhere in the north. This mighty beast, who calls himself Aakhet the Bronze, is apparently a powerful and brave warrior. We must seek an audience with him, as he might be able to offer us valuable knowledge from his past battles against the lizard threat. Even if he could not, the mere thought of their two most feared enemies consorting with each other will surely send shivers through the lizards’ spines." 
 isagumze_a_fear_we_could_use_tooltip:0 "We must either have at least §Y100 relations§! with §YAakhet's Host§!, be occupying their capital in a war, or have at least §Y500 ducats§! and §Y50§! of each mana."

 L03_isagumze_no_longer_protectors_desc:0 "For centuries, we protected Horashesh from the lizardfolk, standing as the only vanguard that kept the ancient enemy of humanity away. But now the destiny of the lizardfolk is ours to take, their empire is our empire, their ambitions are ours. And unlike the lizardfolk, we will not be stopped, we will not fall. Break all treaties, reject all alliances! Let the people of Horashesh tremble in fear, for they will no longer find a protector in the Ikilshebe, but a threat much greater than any lizardfolk empire ever was!"

 L03_isagumze_no_more_compromises_desc:0 "Now that we know what our destiny is, we must take swift action to remove those inside our nation that would try to stop us from reaching it. The Kulugi Abe have taken it upon themselves to purge the nation of these individuals. The Medawor and non-believers inside the Efergezmu alike, they will all be cut from our nation like an infected limb. Let them know no mercy shall be given and none shall be spared, for no fate awaits the enemies of Nyokyora but pain and death."
 L03_isagumze_masters_of_the_waters_title:0 "Masters of the Waters"
 L03_isagumze_masters_of_the_waters_desc:0 "The lizardfolk are natural sailors, their bodies adapted to moving in water. From what we know they have been sailing the seas since the beginning of the world. In contrast, our people have been landlocked for almost the entirety of our history, and only as we conquered Throden Gokad have we come to rule and inhabit coastal lands. It is nonetheless our task to surpass them in every scenario, and that includes the seas. We will finish our conquest of their coast, and build the mightiest navy to ever set sail. Only this way will our claim to their lands be secured against possible attacks from the sea, either from the lizards themselves or their diminutive allies in the Summer Islands."

We must increase the quality of our army even further to improve that ratio. By incorporating the latest innovations in weaponry and military tactics, and subjecting our troops to rigorous training, we can make even greater warriors of our people. If before we were the greatest of Sarhal, after this we will be the greatest of Halann!"

This new government will enshrine the venerable traditions of the Kulugi Abe, and under their guidance the entire nation will achieve the level of might and glory of these proud and good men."

The patheticness of their resistance does not come as a surprise. After all, how can mere men oppose the mighty Ikilshebe? Our conquest is without a doubt the best thing that could happen to them, as only under our rule will they be able to reach their full potential and get out of the pit of mediocrity they were submerged in. Once our conquest is complete and we have made them all bow to us, we will decide the fate of Horashesh, tied now forever to our own."

But it is still not enough! An eternal empire needs a new level of strength, even greater, even more fear-inducing, even mightier. We must prove our superiority beyond any doubt, crush anyone that dares stand in our way, and show why the Ikilshebe are the greatest to ever exist. We are the wrestlers of fate, and we can never be beaten."

Now that we have made this great tradition of them a cornerstone of our government form, we must provide a proper space for these wrestling competitions to be carried on. And what better place than Karassk, the first great city we conquered. The traditional wrestling arenas of our people are built on top of the graves of great warriors, to honor their legacy. With this arena we honor every single warrior that has fought and died to bring us closer to our destiny!"

With the expansion of our empire and the replacement of the Medasi System with the Scaled Lords’ Council, many have raised the necessity of creating a new seat of power fit for our new status. Nyokyoratsha seems perfect for this. We will build a great palace to house the sessions of the Council and serve as residence for the Scaled Speaker. So glorious and magnificent it will be, that the ancient lizardfolk architecture of the city will seem pathetic and minuscule in comparison."

 L03_isagumze_a_prosperous_empire_desc:0 "Our victories against the lizardfolk have brought us great riches, but they have also devastated and depopulated the lands we conquered. An eternal empire cannot be built in burned cities and impoverished subjects. We must ensure the eternal prosperity of our realm. Already factories are being built in every corner, and with slash-and-burn techniques fertile fields are created, ready to produce enough food to feed everyone in our empire three times over.

Terrifying spirits with skin white as chalk and sharp teeth, with human form but no mercy in their hearts, ruthless hunters that flay their victims and wear their skin as armor. But those are no mere legends, for we are these ghosts! Our warriors sharpen their teeth and go to hunt with their skin covered in ash mixed with tree sap, and of course we use the scales of our slain foes as armor, taking the strength from those we defeat. The terror we induce in the lizardfolk must do nothing but increase, they should be so scared that they drop their weapons and run away screaming as soon as our name is mentioned! Let us show them how real the ghosts in the jungle truly are!"

 L03_isagumze_no_more_songs_desc:0 "The monstrous Ashhama infest these lands, crocodile looking beasts that are said to sometimes become possessed by an insatiable bloodlust. Some think they are able to control themselves and effectively suppress their dark urges with music and art, but we pay no credibility to those claims. Even if they were not bloodthirsty beasts, it seems their condition is the result of hag meddling, so their mere presence poses a danger to both lizards and men. Their less monstrous brethren were too weak or soft to put them down earlier, but we will not fail like they did. Once we have crushed them, their thick scales will be perfect for making incredibly resistant scale armor, offering much better protection than the one made by normal lizardfolk scales."

If our empire is to be eternal, we must ensure we are safe from this fate in perpetuity, guaranteeing the eternal loyalty and support of our people. Dissidence is not to be tolerated.

The Ikilshebe, proud as they have always been, are now united for eternity under Nyokyora, in an empire that will never fall.

A rare kind of serpentine lizardfolk who wield great magical power, the old lizardfolk empires could not conceive ruling without the consent of these Naga. We hold no such appreciation for these deceitful creatures, and of course the feeling is mutual. They will never bow to us, so the solution is clear: they will all be slain. The 333rd empire will have no place for them. Of course, this action will provoke great anger of any lizardfolk in our borders that remains an Anzalkatsa faithful, so we must be prepared to control their inevitable reaction."

The lizards call these spires Zatsaryas, and they seem to be of great importance to them, as they defended it fiercely when we took the city. But the keepers of the spire are no more, and neither is Zerat. This is a great opportunity to build the greatest temple the world has ever seen, dedicated of course to the greatest God there is. This way we will prove Nyokyora to be so much mightier than that upstart of Kui, while also creating a center for a new settlement to replace the destroyed Zerat. This city will be baptized as Yaphilikilshe, the city of the broken lizards."

 flavour_isagumze.1.t:0 "The Offer of the Kulugi Abe"
 flavour_isagumze.1.d:0 "The envoy of the Kulugi Abe was the heir of the Ikilshemtu family. A young man, but already a proven warrior as signaled by the scale armor he proudly wore. He had requested to meet the Medaka alone, to avoid any interference from the Medawor or the non-Kulugi Abe families in the Efergezmu. It was almost midnight, and the room was dimly lit by a single candle as the warrior spoke.\n\n"My spear is yours, my Medaka, and so are the spears of my people, if you wish to accept our proposal". He hit the ground with his spear at the end of the sentence. Any other man would have been asked to leave his weapons outside before meeting with the Medaka, but trying to convince a Kulugi Abe to do so was asking them to cut off a limb. "The Ikilshemtu, the Wangunagye, and the Meguni are all eager to begin this collaboration. The Sigimtu were more reluctant, you know how much they loathe the Compromise, but we managed to convince them it was for the good of our people, and the perpetuation of our traditions. The Alangba are in your hands of course, but I am sure our support would help calm the concerns of any malcontent member of the family".\n\nThe Medaka pretended to ponder for a second, not wanting to appear too eager to accept, but the truth was that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not really have a choice. The support of the Kulugi Abe would be invaluable for the coming wars, while offending them by rejecting their offer would undoubtedly end with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head on a spear and the country in civil war. The Kulugi Abe knew this, and he smiled widely, showing his serrated teeth, as the Medaka spoke."
 flavour_isagumze.1.a:0 "Of course we accept!"
 flavour_isagumze.2.t:0 "Isagumze asks for support"
 flavour_isagumze.2.d:0 "Our allies in Isagumze have sent us a request for men and gold, claiming they need them to fuel their campaigns against their hated enemies, the lizardfolk. They promise to repay us in the future with the loot of their wars, swearing we will get our money quadrupled. We cannot question the honesty of the noble Ikilshebe people, but some in our country raise doubts about their ability to actually succeed on those wars, regardless of how much support they have."
 flavour_isagumze.2.a:0 "Their cause is noble"
 flavour_isagumze.2.b:0 "They are fools, and supporting them would be foolish"
 flavour_isagumze.3.t:0 "The promised payment"
 flavour_isagumze.3.d:0 "To the surprise of many in our court, Isagumze has achieved significant success in their eastern campaigns. Now, true to their word, they have sent us four times the amount of our original loan. Obtaining the money has undoubtedly required a particularly cruel looting of the conquered lizardfolk, but the general consensus in our country is that that is not our problem."
 flavour_isagumze.3.a:0 "Now, where could we spend it?"
 flavour_isagumze.4.t:0 "A Lesson in Lizardfolk Culture"
 flavour_isagumze.4.d:0 "Fumanekilnya !Xe Alangba entered the room, accompanied by a young boy, his nephew and guide, carrying a heavy looking bag. The renowned Griot and former warrior, blinded in battle against the lizardfolk, had been tasked some time ago with leading the research in lizardfolk culture. He now requested an audience with the Medaka in order to share his discoveries. \n\n"My Medaka, today I bring you two invaluable pieces of information. One a great opportunity, the other a dire warning". Fumanekilnya shifted his staff in the air and softly hit his nephew’s head, prompting the kid to take a large scroll out of his bag. It depicted many green dragons flying above a burning city. "This is a copy of a mural found in a lizardfolk temple. It speaks of what they call the Greenblight, a dragon attack that their civilization suffered in ancient times and that almost wiped them out, unfortunately not completely. Knowing there is a dragon alive in the North, I trust you can figure the obvious next step yourself".\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking a second staff strike, this time a bit stronger, hit the boy’s head, causing him to quickly take out a smaller scroll filled with the multicolored scripture of the lizardfolk. "This one contains one of the many narrations of the prophecy of the 333rd empire, the cornerstone of the lizard’s faith. It tells of 332 empires of lizardfolk that have come to be and fallen in the past, and of a final one that will unite their lands under its rule and last for all eternity. I told you it was a dire warning, for if this were to come true, our conquests would undoubtedly be lost and our people wiped from existence."\n\nThe Medaka tried to speak, but was promptly interrupted by a loud crash, as Fumanekilnya hit the ground with his staff with such force that it broke in two. "But I have not come here to foretell doom and do nothing about it. I will join your court immediately, and continue my research here with your support. Wise Nyokyora would not have led us all the way here to abandon us to our death." Without another word the Griot left, with his nephew hurriedly following him, leaving behind a shocked and confused Medaka."
 flavour_isagumze.4.a:0 "Concerning..."
 flavour_isagumze.5.t:0 "Preparing the delegation"
 flavour_isagumze.5.d:0 "It has not been easy, but we have managed to secure an audience with Aakhet the Bronze. The meeting will take place in a year, giving us plenty of time to prepare an appropriate delegation. The various factions in our country have, of course, turned this preparation into a power struggle. The general organization and composition has more or less been agreed upon, but two main points of contention remain: who will be the head of the delegation, and what kind of gifts will we bring Aakhet.\n\nThe Medawor are championing one of their own, an elderly noble named Bayek, under the premise that he has ties with Aakhet. This is, being generous, a half truth. His great-grandfather was standing guard outside the war room in Aramoole when the dragon revealed himself, but it is still something. Regarding the gifts, they have gathered a selection of luxurious and exotic goods, prepared according to the information about Aakhet tastes that one of their contacts, a former servant of the dragon in Araamole, supplied them with.\n\nOn the side of the Efergezmu, the most talked about candidate is Vunyani, a Kulugi Abe of the Wangunagye family. A battle scarred warrior, they believe he will be able to appeal to Aakhet martial sensibilities. In the same spirit, they plan to offer him an assortment of rare armor and weaponry, as they have heard he collects such items.\n\nSome less factionalist individuals in our court are proposing a third option, which would be to simply send both gifts and have the delegation headed by the Medaka [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. This would avoid the boost of influence that the faction behind the chosen proposal would get otherwise, but it would also be significantly more expensive."
 flavour_isagumze.5.a:0 "Choose the Kulugi Abe proposal."
 flavour_isagumze.5.b:0 "Choose the Medawor proposal."
 flavour_isagumze.5.c:0 "It is probably better to send the Medaka."
 flavour_isagumze.6.t:0 "The Wisdom of an Inmortal"
 flavour_isagumze.6.d:0 "Having heard of Aakhet shapeshifting and assuming various human forms, the members of the delegation had spent their travel speculating about which appearance would the dragon take when they met him. What none were expecting was for the bronze dragon to receive them in the form of an Irsukumba warrior dressed in the traditional regalia of the Ikilshebe kings. Especially striking was the magnificent Naga skin cape he carried, although it had an old and worn out look to it.\n\nSmiling widely, which showed that this form also had the serrated teeth typical of Ikilshebe warriors, Aakhet approached the delegation and spoke with a commanding voice. "I thought it would be appropriate to take a familiar form, and of course it was also an opportunity to wear some of the old items of my collection". Aakhet's eyes swiftly scanned the members of the delegation and the gifts, but before any of them could utter a word he spoke again.\n\n"I of course know why you are here. You seek my invaluable military advice on your war against the lizardfolk. I have battled them before, probably more than any other being, although not in the Greenblight they speak so much about. I am not green, as I hope you are smart enough to notice". Aakhet chuckled at his own joke, and then seemed to get lost in his thoughts for a second, before resuming his speech just as a Griot opened his mouth to ask a question.\n\n"My greatest victories against them are centuries old now, but the knowledge that allowed me to triumph in them still hold true today. I will not teach you all that knowledge, as we would be here for years and you would not be able to understand a hundredth part of it anyways. What I can tell you, and make sure you take note of this, is that if you wish to seize the ancient cities of the reptiles, your army must be well-equipped, well-fed, and faster than an arrow, and of course you already know which one of those is the most important. I hope you know at least, you would all have to be absolute fools to not know, and for your own good I hope you did not make me lose my precious time speaking to fools"."
 flavour_isagumze.6.a:0 "Of course, we should invest in standardizing equipment production."
 flavour_isagumze.6.b:0 "He thinks we need to increase our army mobility to outmaneuver our enemies."
 flavour_isagumze.6.c:0 "He obviously meant we have to ensure our troops are well-fed to avoid attrition."
 flavour_isagumze.7.t:0 "God in flesh and scales?"
 flavour_isagumze.7.d:0 "Aakhet, satisfied with the interpretation of his advice, continued speaking, narrating countless anecdotes and stories, as the men of the delegation attentively listened. The Griots seemed to be particularly enjoying the meeting, and it would definitively not take long for songs and retellings of Aakhet adventures to be heard across the cities and villages of Horashesh.\n\n"Wait, I see it now, you are Him!".\n\nThe shout interrupted Aakhet's story, causing all looks to turn towards its source, an elderly Griot with a look of absolute shock in his face. Gazes then turned back to Aakhet, fearing a reprisal for such insolence, but, uncharacteristically, the dragon did not seem to mind having been interrupted, and in fact a subtle smirk adorned his face. The Griot, still looking greatly shaken, started speaking again.\n\n"I should have realized earlier, your appearance, your clothing, the Naga cape, it is all like in the stories. You said you fought the lizards centuries ago, more than any other, and there has been no greater foe to them than Him. You know the customs of our people, and in the way you speak I recognize His voice, just as I have heard it in so many songs and stories." The man fell to his knees, and as the rest of the delegation rushed to help him, he looked up at Aakhet, his eyes full of tears. "I always knew I would see you one day, but not before my death. I am not worthy, blessed Nyokyora".\n\nAnd as all gazes turned to Him in shock, Aakhet just let out a chuckle and spoke in an amused tone. "I was starting to think you would never figure it out"." 
 flavour_isagumze.7.a:0 "Praise him, praise Aakhet-who-is-Nyokyora!"
 flavour_isagumze.7.b:0 "This is just a misunderstanding, Nyokyora was born human."
 flavour_isagumze.8.t:0 "Destiny in our hands"
 flavour_isagumze.8.d:0 ""You cannot possibly be serious!"\n\nThe outraged shouts of the Medawor spoke for many in court at that moment, as Fumanekilnya !Xe Alangba exposed his theory to a shocked Medaka. "I am more than serious, cat worshiper. You may refuse to accept my words, but that does not make them any less true. I have spent years studying the prophecy, and my conclusions are clear: the 333rd empire will come to be, regardless of what any man does or wishes".\n\n"So you are proposing we just surrender to fate and accept our doom? Just resign to being crushed by the lizards because the prophecy says so?."\n\n"I am proposing the exact opposite". The tone of the blind scholar turned more and more enthusiastic as he spoke. "Ordinary men accept fate, fools try to resist it, but we are neither. The Ikilshebe are the greatest, and we can do what no one else can. We can take the strength of the lizardfolk by wearing their hide, who can then tell us that we cannot take their destiny too? Temporary glory is at the reach of anyone, but eternal glory is usually reserved for the gods. This is our opportunity to take it for all of our people. It is us who must claim the mantle of the 333rd empire, the Empire of Scales, Kumkayeisak! The choice is yours. We can usurp the lizards’ fate, wrestle destiny, and conquer eternity, or we can ignore the truth and face certain doom!".\n\n"Have you gone ma-". The Medawor voice was drowned in the shouts of the Kulugi Abe, who at unison chanted the name of that prophesied empire, Kumkayeisak, as they hit the ground with their spears.\n\nSmiling, Fumanekilnya bowed to the Medaka and softly spoke "So, what do you choose"."

 flavour_isagumze.9.d:0 "Oh Zerat. How glorious must the ancient city have been when it stood as the heart of the great empire of the lizardfolk, and how low it had fallen under the rule of those that refused to admit their time had ended. Nothing more than an old rotten heart that stubbornly keeps beating, futilely trying to delay the unstoppable flow of fate.\n\nBut that ends now. Our warriors have been let loose in the city, with orders to leave no brick standing on top of another and no lizard spared. Everything they hold sacred and dear will be destroyed. Their delusions, their futile hopes of rebuilding their empire, squashed into the ground and shattered under our feet.\n\nWhen the sacking is over the city will have been purified, the great spire left as the only thing standing intact on top of charred ruins, our bravest soldiers adorned with the scales of its stubborn defenders.\n\nWho can deny our claim to the eternal empire now, when we have torn down the last remnant of the last one? We have proved ourselves worthy and honored the great Nyokyora. Fate is now at the reach of our hands, and no one can keep us from grabbing it."
 flavour_isagumze.9.a:0 "One step closer to eternity"
 flavour_isagumze.10.t:0 "No more compromises"
 flavour_isagumze.10.d:0 ""I would be lying if I said I did not expect it to end like this". The Medawor bitterly said, as he took his sword out of the sheath and entered a defensive stance. "But I never thought you would be the one to do it. Sicelo, after all those battles, after all the lizard blood we shed together, does the battle bond your people so fondly speak of mean nothing to you?I thought you were like my brother, that you were above all this barbarism and superstition, but you have fallen for it like all your brethren".\n\n"You are like my brother Nazem, that is why I came for you myself. Because even if you reject Nyokyora, even if you refuse to see the truth, even if you must stubbornly stand in front of the destiny of my people, you are my brother, and I love you. I came to grant you the death of a warrior, not a traitor, and to ensure the safety of your family". The tone of the Kulugi Abe was full of sadness, and Nazem saw in his eyes it was sincere, but he could also see the fervor and the devotion for his God and his promised fate, burning so much brighter. He knew there would be no use in bargaining or begging.\n\n"My family, if Elikhet is merciful, will be already in Khetapera. I sent them north as soon as I saw the Medaka gave credit to that mad Griot". Spitting in the ground, he stepped forward. "And you are not my brother. You are a mad man and a barbarian, like all of your people, and I was a fool for believing there could be peace between us. I know I am to die today, and I know I will not see the Sorrow again, but Elikhet willing, I will send you to your bastard god before I am gone". Nazem launched himself at his former brother in arms, sword in hand, as Sicelo brandished his spear.\n\nAnd as the two warriors fought and died, a hundred fires glistened into the night, and the entire country was filled with sounds of battle and death."

Their resistance was pitiful, and it makes us embarrassed to have once called ourselves Irsukuba, as our brethren are on the same level of weakness as the native Vurebindu. However, they both have potential. After all, we were but mere men before Nyokyora led us to greatness. Under our guidance they can become mighty warriors, perhaps almost as good as the Ikilshebe. There are different opinions on how could we make this process as fast as possible, with some believing we should leave them some level of autonomy under our rule, while others support fully integrating them in the Empire of Scales."

Gargantuan white marble walls, crowned with bronze and gold statues of Ikilshebe heroes. Inside, mosaics adorn the walls of the many rooms and halls, depicting the great tales and legends the Griots have spent centuries retelling.\n\nIn the center, and crowned by a great dome, is the biggest of the rooms, with a gigantic round table in the middle, intended to house the reunions of the Scaled Lords’ Council. Many other rooms are dedicated to a variety of purposes, from administration offices, to training rooms and armories, and of course plenty of living spaces, some glorious and others more lowly, to house everyone that inhabits the palace, from rulers to servants.\n\nThe Palace will definitely become an important administrative center, and most in our nation believe it should become the new capital too, to truly signify our transition into the Empire of Scales."

Of course nothing is impossible for the brave Ikilshebe warriors. The deployed hunting parties soon started bringing hundreds and hundreds of Naga skins as trophies, and the numbers of the already rare serpentine creatures quickly plummeted down.\n\nAs this was done, the anger of the lizardfolk inside our borders grew more and more, and became more noticeable each day. Our authorities dismissed this at first, with any lizardfolk who dared pose actual resistance soon finding themselves turned into a new set of armor, but eventually the agitation escalated into rebellion. Hunting parties disappeared never to be seen again, entire areas rose against our government, and at the front of it all, many of the Nagas we believed basically extinct, leading entire armies of rebels against us!\n\nThis is the largest threat to our rule in lizardfolk land we have seen in years, and perhaps the last one we need to defeat before our domain is consolidated. We must act quickly, or we could find ourselves crushed by the coils of the snakes we wanted to slay."

That might still be true for most of humanity. But in Sarhal there is a people who, upon seeing that the stream wished to drown them and deny them the victories they fought so hard to gain, grasped it with fiery hands and shaped it into glass, giving it the form they wished. Who could it be but the Ikilshebe, the chosen of Nyokyora, the wrestlers of fate, the conquerors of eternity.\n\nWe have not only subjugated all the lands of the lizardfolk, but we have built an empire of firm foundations in them. The prophecy is fulfilled, Fumanekilnya’s vision has been achieved, and no one can deny it any longer. The 333rd Empire has arrived, not as Khatalashya, but as Kumkayeisak! The Empire of Scales, made by the Ikilshebe, blessed by Nyokyora, and fated to be eternal\n\nAs the [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] finished his speech, his voice magically amplified by the empire wizards so that everyone in Nyokyoratsha could hear it, the thousand warriors gathered at the foot of the Palace of the Scaled Lords chanted at unison, "Nyokyora Kungaff, Glory to Kumkayeisak, Glory to the Scaled Lords!", hitting the ground with their spears on every word.
