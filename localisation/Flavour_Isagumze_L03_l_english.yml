Piecing together some comments Aakhet made, and the fact that his human appearance today looks very similar to some portrayals and descriptions of Nyokyora, the priest has come to a shocking conclusion, Aakhet is Nyokyora! The delegation explodes in a chaotic mix of shock, indignation and confusion. Meanwhile, Aakhet merely chuckles, and says he was wondering how much would it take for someone to figure it out."

Nothing more than an old rotten heart that stubbornly keeps beating, futilely trying to delay the unstoppable flow of fate.\n\nBut that ends now, our troops have been let loose in the city, with orders to leave no brick standing on top of another and no lizard spared. When the sacking is over the city will have been purified, the great spire left as the only thing standing intact on top of charred ruins, our bravest soldiers adorned with the scales of its stubborn defenders.\n\nWho can deny our claim to the eternal empire now, when we have torn down the last remnant of the last one?

The head of this council, who receives the name of Scaled Speaker, is selected each decade via a ritualized wrestling competition, in which candidates of the five families compete to determine who is the most worthy to lead the Ikilshebe. The winner, having proven himself to be the chosen of Nyokyora, will fill this position for 10 years, after which a new Scaled Speaker will be elected."
