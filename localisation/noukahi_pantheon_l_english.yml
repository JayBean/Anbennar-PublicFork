 noukahi_pantheon_religion_desc:0 "The Nouakahi Pantheon is a loosely connected collection of stories concerning heroic figures to the Vurebindu and Irsukuba people of Horashesh. The religion borrows heavily from neighbouring Fangaula, Nakavy Avo, and Khetist myths, meaning there are very few unifying themes. Instead each tale has different teachings and meanings, often varying depending on the person telling the story."

 HOLY_SITE_5863_DESC:0 "The shattered spire at Lake Kuiziva is so obviously not of this world, and many tales mythologising its true origins exist. For the people of Fangaula, it stood as the furthest point of their once mighty empire, and is said to be a bridge to the moon and a spirits final resting spot. For the people of Horashesh, it was where the warlord Kui announced his divinity. Legend says the spire started to sparkle with the light of the stars as he spoke, proving his status as the god's chosen."
 HOLY_SITE_6599_DESC:0 "In defence of the Vurebindu people, the creator Zuvanofa slayed the king of the genies in battle. However, he was wounded in the process. His consort, Noromhanda, took him to the Temple of Lel to heal, summoning seahorses to help bandage his wounds. As with many of the stories in the Noukahi Pantheon, there’s likely a grain of truth behind centuries of myth, as variations of this story also exist in the Nakavy Avo religion. The Temple of Lel is very real though. It still stands in the centre of Lelanán today, its walls adorned with seahorse mosaics."
 HOLY_SITE_5808_DESC:0 "The volcano Junansuar is home to a former Efreeti palace which has been transformed into a monastery dedicated to the divine blast kiln Mojobaa. Deep within the volcano, legends say Mojobaa forges weapons and tools in a divine workshop to combat God’s and creation’s enemies. Monks known for their exceptional blacksmithing skills tend the holy site, crafting powerful ironwood steel weapons imbued with elemental magic."
 HOLY_SITE_5941_DESC:0 "Lizardfolk are the ancient enemy for the people of Horashesh. Here before Zuvanofa created the world, they are considered an eternal threat to humanity. But that does not mean there is no respect for their culture and civilization. When the Iksilshebe warlord Nyokyora pushed deep into the lizardfolk jungle, his fellow warriors came back speaking in awed tones about the cities they uncovered. In the centre of the great city of Nahzni stood a circle of spires, each almost as large as the Kuiika Gamyi, appearing as though they were hewn from the stars themselves."
 HOLY_SITE_6063_DESC:0 "The first humans to cross the Salahad into Noukahi were led by Ardim, the chosen hero of Zuvanofa. She took them on a great procession across desert, mountain, swamp, and sea, until they landed at Ardim Qarast. There, she founded a great civilisation that stood for millenia, until it was buried by sand and sea. Variations of this story can be found all across Sarhal, although most historians scoff at the idea it could be real. To find this mythical city would upend our understanding of history."
 HOLY_SITE_6659_DESC:0 "No tale in the Noukahi Pantheon is more successful at stirring the hearts of the Horashesh people than that of Naléni and Nzeri. As the story goes, Naléni was a harpy that snatched Nzeri’s husband from the mountaintop and flew east. Determined to rescue her husband, Nzeri sprouted a pair of wings and chased Naléni down to the far end of Sarhal. On its surface it’s a love story, but in truth it’s far more than that. It’s about honour, pride, and the determination to never back down in the face of adversity. There is no greater sign of devotion than to stand atop the cliffs of Jezarpízu and declare your love."
 HOLY_SITE_5481_DESC:0 "Centuries of Kheteratan rule has its impact on one's faith. Certain figures cross religions if their stories are compelling enough, for there is nothing those following the Noukahi Pantheon love more than a good story. That is how Niramhat came to be. In Khetism she is Nirakhet, mother of Elikhet, whose tears pooled at Lake Nirakhet and became the enchanted river of The Sorrow. In the Noukahi Pantheon she is Niramhat, the All-Queen, and husband of Zuvanofa. But the tale of her tears creating The Sorrow is told across both faiths, making Lake Nirakhet a sacred place for both religions."
 HOLY_SITE_6690_DESC:0 "The Echenka are long-lost brethren of the Irsukuba people who never migrated to Horashesh. Instead they lived in the Rakkazi Highlands, on the outskirts of what was once their lush and green homeland: The Shadow Swamp. The legend amongst the Irsukubu people is that the great hag Hireet Gloomweaver offered the queen of the Echenka, Lama Kerac, the ability to revive her recently deceased husband. The spell worked, but in returning color to her husband, the Queen’s body was cursed. Everywhere she stood drained color from the land itself. In an attempt to contain the shadow's spread, she nailed herself to the Shadowroot Matriarch where she supposedly still resides. While the tale has many meanings to the Irsukuba people, the main message is quite simple: Never make a deal with the hags."
