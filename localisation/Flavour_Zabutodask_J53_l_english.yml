 JXX_new_begining_title: "A New Begining"

 #Missions
 J53_man_nature_title: "Man and Nature"
 J53_man_nature_desc: "Many humans view nature as something in need of conquest, a wild and dangerous frontier that only few dare to venture into. Ek'chorvu was one such man, one who not only braved the wilderness, but made a bond with the beasts within on behalf of all our kind. Husbandry is his creation, and earned him the singular honor of being a god born mortal.\nWhile the centaurs have utilized herding they have not abided by the bonds of nature we hold, we must restore this."
 J53_bonds_man_title: "The Bonds of Man"
 J53_bonds_man_desc: "The role of bondage has expanded since the days of Ek'chorvu. Once wandering tribes were content to stick to their own kin and found more comfort in their own herds than their fellow tribes. From Ek’chorvu we learn not only to bond with animals, but our fellow people as well. Domestication may be a crass term for a human, but there are fewer feats greater than making a friend from a stranger."
 J53_taqoshurs_warmth_title: "Taqoshur's Warmth"
 J53_taqoshurs_warmth_desc: "From the Blue Sea and beyond, cold winds sprint unhindered across the steppe, and it was Taqoshur that protected us from these frigid gales. The Ustiq'lik, receptors and providers of Taqoshur’s warmth, have degraded over the centuries of disrespect. Taqoshur has enabled us to build civilization but no longer gives his warmth so freely. Some ponder if we should prove our worth without his hand holding, or perhaps restore them to regain his aid."
 J53_life_warmth_title: "Life From Warmth"
 J53_life_warmth_desc: "Taqoshur provides all that civilization needs to grow, but it is by our hands that it must be done. Asimlik once taught us how to do this, and in our absence he has gathered many more lessons for us. Vast grasses inedible to man create a beige ocean, but with his lessons we turn the sun’s life into our own."
 J53_three_waters_title: "Three Faces of Waters"
 J53_three_waters_desc: "We once knew only one goddess upon the waters, Yukel. When our fate became intertwined with the followers of Kodave and Enuuk, these divine matriarchs became family. More recently however, the common interpretation of them has not been two sisters and a mother standing together, but one figure bearing three faces.\nJust as sailors must accept the changing of the current, we should accept this new identity for Yukel."
 
 J53_promise_sun_dream_title: "Promise of Sun and Dream"
 J53_promise_sun_dream_desc: "Soiti… Soiti… a name not uttered in a millennium, makes themself known to mages as though a grandparent made jovial by their descendant’s visitation. In these dreams, a truth is made known to our people:\nTaqoshur is the radiance above all our heads and the plains are his domain to which he gladly welcomes our return. As we forsake the islands of the lakes, let us adopt the will of He who rules all surfaces which receive the Sun’s warmth."
 J53_ancient_mother_title: "The Ancient Mother"
 J53_ancient_mother_desc: "Yukel, once known as Yushel before her association with the other Goddesses, protected us for centuries from the storm that surrounded us. While we are ready to leave her caring embrace, her role and her coasts shall not be forgotten."
 J53_goddess_peace_title: "Goddess of Peace"
 J53_goddess_peace_desc: "While our ancestors bothered little with the open water, we have more recently learned how tranquil it can be. While even a horse can grow wary of travel, the boat is eager to bring us along the coasts and down the river. On a similar note, Yukel is happy to wait for us when respite is needed from the steppe."
 J53_sword_gun_title: "The Sword and Gun"
 J53_sword_gun_desc: "The sword is a dangerous tool. Those able to yield it can acquire whatever they desire. The hammer creates buildings, the lute creates music, but the weapon does not create. Whether it is used to take from others or defend what is ours is a question Yerush answers, and it is peace that must be both taken and defended."
 J53_open_skies_title: "God of the Open Sky"
 J53_open_skies_desc: "If the Sun is in the sky, then surely the Centaurs gleaned some truth from their worship of the blue heaven. Shirdos shall ensure honor in our peace by bringing storms or paradisal bliss to those who earn it."
 J53_shield_axe_title: "The Shield and Axe"
 J53_shield_axe_desc: "The Serpentspine mountains that surround our home have sheltered us from the wicked evils that inhabit this world and while Yerush can defend us against the people who wish to harm us, some threats can not be culled by steel alone. Tayoghur offers us his shield to protect against those who thrive in the darkness away from Taqoshur, and his silver axe to drive them back to it.\nNot all under the ground is evil however, for wealth exists within the depths, and Tayoghur is master of such metals."
 J53_over_hills_title: "Over the Hills"
 J53_over_hills_desc: "The Harpies have historically abetted our incursions into Bulwar. They shall do so again, and with the sun on our faces and the wind on our backs we shall be unstoppable."
 
 J53_new_identity_title: "A New Identity"
 J53_new_identity_desc: "Our Ancestors, especially the Zabatlari, were masters of the open plains. Now that the Zabatlari are content in their cities, it is up to us to champion the return of our blood to the steppe."
 J53_homeland_grass_title: "Homeland of Grass"
 J53_homeland_grass_desc: "We must not only conquer the steppe, but truly make it our home. Wanderers, brigands, Jolgik Uts, any without a home will find one to claim on the open grasses."
 J53_cross_egoirlust_title: "Cross the Egoirlust"
 J53_cross_egoirlust_desc: "The Serpent's Gift splits the Plains in two. If we are to control the entire steppe, we must cross the river and push from both sides."
 J53_securing_waters_title: "Securing Waters"
 J53_securing_waters_desc: "While the sun gives life, it cannot endure without water. In order for us to prosper, we must secure our sources of water, and ensure the Centaurs cannot threaten our access to it."
 J53_plains_unforbidden_title: "Plains Unforbidden"
 J53_plains_unforbidden_desc: "With the hostile Centaurs controlling the plains for centuries, the land had gained a reputation of being Foribbden to all who are not on four legs. We shall break that stigma once and for all and then consider the fate of those that brought it about."
 J53_gift_serpent_title: "Gift of the Serpent"
 J53_gift_serpent_desc: "The waters the Serpentspine brings to the plains are a great gift. We must control them and determine what place, if any, Centaurs shall hold in our society."
 J53_old_new_home_title: "Old Home, New Home"
 J53_old_new_home_desc: "These lands are our legacy. In the grand scheme of history, our absence is a brief instance now concluded. The Worldly Gods prepared for our return and now we shall prosper in their domain."
 J53_pantheon_reborn_title: "The Pantheon Reborn"
 J53_pantheon_reborn_desc: "The Sun Cults of the south have diverged significantly from the will of Taqoshur, believing Darkness to have consumed all the sun does not protect. Reconciling these beliefs may prove difficult, but their sacred sites provide us a means to hold dialogue, and control it."
 J53_storm_powder_title: "A Storm of Powder"
 J53_storm_powder_desc: "A thousand guns fire in an instant, and before the smoke clears we are upon our foe. Our riders are a black storm that bears down upon any in our path, and no valor can spare one from choking on the smog."
 J53_taqoshur_garden_title: "Taqoshur's Garden"
 J53_taqoshur_garden_desc: "The Bulwari have cultivated their heartland in honor of Taqoshur, even if they did not know him truly. Even our ancestral cousins, while not the majority here, left their flowers in this garden, and now we return to admire and cultivate them."
 
 J53_govern_steppe_title: "To Govern the Steppe"
 J53_govern_steppe_desc: "A simple election taken on ballots can be an effective system when nearly all those casting them live within one city. However the prospect of collecting papers from all those across the wide plain is folly, and a more appropriate means of garnering consensus must be acquired.\nLet those who wish to make their will known come to predetermined meetings, where he who shall lead us all can be determined fairly."
 J53_taking_steppe_title: "Taking to the Steppe"
 J53_taking_steppe_desc: "Our ancestors invented horseback riding, but on the rugged islands we fell out of practice. Now that we return to our homeland we must relearn how to best make use of the horse."
 J53_southwards_eastwards_title: "Southwards and Eastwards"
 J53_southwards_eastwards_desc: "The steppe expands before us, but it is not endless. We must secure the land as far as the eye can see before our ambition falls out of sight."
 J53_frontier_sand_title: "Frontier of Sand"
 J53_frontier_sand_desc: "While the Steppe may end, the world does not. BeyondBefore the great mountains lies a sea of sand, and this too must fall under our control."
 J53_mount_invasion_title: "Mount an Invasion"
 J53_mount_invasion_desc: "The Lands of Bulwar lie south of the Sertpentspine, and they remember our ancestors nearly as well as we did before rediscovering our roots. They worship Taqoshur in a false form, and we must repeat the interventions of our ancestors to remind them that while Taqoshur rules from above, he does not rule alone."
 J53_through_passes_title: "Through the Passes"
 J53_through_passes_desc: "While our ancestors historically used the Invader's Pass to the West, we are under no obligation to follow their antiquated strategies. The Pass of Mulén affords us a second approach with which to divide and conquer the Bulwari."
 J53_across_sands_title: "Across the Sands"
 J53_across_sands_desc: "The lands of Bulwar hold many wonders, but the most practical among them is the Golden Highway. By extending it to the Plains we may gain a means to quickly journey between our heartland and these new provinces."
 
 J53_return_equestrianism_title: "Return to Equestrianism"
 J53_return_equestrianism_desc: "In these lands a soldier is only useful if he is on a horse. In order to muster the needed beasts, we should secure ample lands for grazing and farmland for grains with which to feed them."
 J53_lessons_firearm_title: "Lessons of the Firearm"
 J53_lessons_firearm_desc: "The Centaur may be stronger and fiercer than us, but we have a new trick: the firearm. A Charging stampede can be struck down by a crack of thunder and a hail of metal."
 J53_roaming_steppe_title: "Roaming the Steppe"
 J53_roaming_steppe_desc: "The steppe is one continuous home for our people, and it has no true center. As the grasses flutter endlessly in the wind, we must let the winds carry us where they will, and see all which our home has to offer."
 J53_guns_mounted_title: "Guns for the Mounted"
 J53_guns_mounted_desc: "How effective our cavalry is against our enemies is merely a factor of how much firepower we can muster on horseback. A horse is strong enough to carry both a soldier and his weapons, so there is no reason he cannot yield more than one."
 J53_orachav_military_title: "An Orachav Military"
 J53_orachav_military_desc: "The Orachav are a diverse and independent people, but we have common values. The freedom the mount gives us across the plains is something we are all willing to fight for, and this shall never be taken from us so long as we are willing to come to our brethren's aid."

 #Mission Events
 flavour_splinter.1.t: "Old Sun Rising"
 flavour_splinter.1.d: "Long ago, before ashes covered the sky, the people of the steppe worshiped a pantheon known as the Yudunyovi, or Worldly Gods. Chief among them was Taqoshur, whose warmth from above provides life to the world. But it was Soiti, who resides outside this order, that beckoned this truth to us through their grand-children, who bear the gift of magic in this world.\n\nJust as we reclaim our ancient homelands, it is imperative we reclaim our rightful place as those blessed by Taqoshur and uncover the truths of his pantheon."
 flavour_splinter.1.a: "In the name of the Worldly Gods!"
 
 flavour_splinter.3.t: "The Use of Ustiq'lik"
 flavour_splinter.3.d: "In winters long past, making camp in proximity of the ancient stone obelisks was the most effective way to keep warm, for the Ustiq’lik held onto the warmth of Taqoshur and graced it upon his followers. This significance made the lonely pillars the most sacred locations upon the otherwise untamed steppe, and tribes would hold meetings by their pleasant radiance.\n\nNow, they are crumbling ruins disregarded for countless years. Some claim that with our developed textiles and furs we have no need to cling to these static positions, for it is the right of our people to move freely. Others suggest that to truly know the blessings of Taqoshur, his holy sites must be restored in some fashion; a feat easier to speak of than to accomplish."
 flavour_splinter.3.a: "We should restore the Ustiq'lik"
 J53_retore_ustiqlik_tt: "§YClerical Inward Focus§! and §YDevelopment of Temples§! give §G+5%§! Clergy Loyalty Equilibrium."
 flavour_splinter.3.b: "We should abandon the Ustiq'lik"
 J53_abandon_ustiqlik_tt: "§YClerical Advisory Council§! and §YReligious State§! give §G+5%§! Clergy Loyalty Equilibrium."
 
 flavour_splinter.4.t: "Centaurs Flee South"
 flavour_splinter.4.d: "The Centaurs, once the bane of mankind, are now in desperate retreat. The plains they once claimed for themselves are no longer under their hooves, and they flee towards the mountains where they will be cornered like dogs.\n\nLike those animals, they will fight ferociously in desperation, however some have argued that such drastic measures are unneeded. While the animosity between our peoples is great, there is no need for us to continue the cycle of violence that has plagued our races. Perhaps our position of strength could be used not for violence, but to bring about lasting peace after centuries of strife."
 flavour_splinter.4.a: "The time has come to make peace with them."
 flavour_splinter.4.b: "Nonsense, we will drive them off the face of Halann!"
 
 flavour_splinter.5.t: "Third Great Cleansing"
 flavour_splinter.5.d: "In a faraway land, an Emperor sought to end the Centaur race after strife emerged between them and man. As they fled from him and came to our lands, their hatred surged like a storm across the plains and ended our way of life.\n\nTwo wrongs have now been righted. We have reclaimed our way of life, and we have finished what the Castan started. The Serpent’s Gift runs red with the blood of their failing race, and the sands likewise now carry a stain that even years will not erase. What scattered few remain shall know no mercy, and they shall know no escape, for the paradise they claimed is now a cage they cannot escape.\n\nFor we carry the weapons."
 flavour_splinter.5.a: "We bear the torch of the foreign Beastbane."
 
 flavour_splinter.6.t: "A New Dawn"
 flavour_splinter.6.d: "Once, the lands of Bulwar were ruled by cold and hateful gods, who viewed humanity as nothing more than slaves. Our ancestors showed them that the divine can be a source of warmth too, but their pessimism outlasted our stay, and they came to know Taqoshur as Surael; a lone warrior against a terrible darkness.\n\nWhile night may always come, the sun always follows. The despair the peoples of Bulwar feel is unwarranted, for Taqoshur shines above and does not care for this world alone. A new dawn prepares to rise over Bulwar, one to expel their darkness once and for all and let them bask in the gentle warmth of Taqoshur.\n\nThe only question is how to organize them after the fact. Conquering them upon horseback may be the straightforward answer, but they may find our warm rule more pleasant under their familiar polities."
 flavour_splinter.6.a: "We shall bring warmth to them directly."
 flavour_splinter.6.b: "We shall teach their rulers the truth."
 
 flavour_splinter.7.t: "All Under the Sun"
 flavour_splinter.7.d: "Bulwar is a land plagued by darkness: gnolls, harpies, and goblins swarm upon their lands seeking to claim their haven for their own, much as the Centaurs once did to us. It is no wonder then that this struggle takes form in their religious doctrine.\n\nThose destined to fight in this struggle vary between the sects of their faiths, but in their darkness they failed to perceive the truth; the Sun shines upon all who walk upon the world, it’s warmth cares nothing for your race, it does not even care for your devotion, for Taqoshur is benevolent towards all. Darkness is not a malevolent force bent upon this world, but the natural chaotic state that Taqoshur allows us to thrive away from.\n\nHe gives freely all the gifts this world needs to create and know joy, and the Yudunyovi under him help guide us to that end. He is not so cruel as to choose a specific people for this gift of life, and it is our duty to ensure all know this."
 flavour_splinter.7.a: "The solar schism shall soon end."
 
 flavour_splinter.9.t: "Return to Suran"
 flavour_splinter.9.d: "The Paradise Gardens, circular, symmetrical, and often walled, show clearly the influence Taqoshur held within the ancient peoples of Bulwar. A representation of life derived from light, guarded against the external, where water and wind flow gently. It is no coincidence the Bulwari deemed Taqoshur lord of civilization itself, a title we cannot help but endorse.\n\nWithout the Yudunyovi, the earthly paradise we walk upon could not be sustained, for even these gardens would prove an impossible feat without their gifts and lessons. While some may claim the Ustiq’lik as a marking of Taqoshur’s favor towards our people, this is a land so shined upon that they do not have need for them, so even if we are favored by the sun, it is this land that bears his grace."
 flavour_splinter.9.a: "Our return to the Suran is as fated as the sun rising."
