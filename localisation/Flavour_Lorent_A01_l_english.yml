 #Events

 flavor_lorent.1.t:0 "The Ruby Crown Awakened"
 flavor_lorent.1.d:0 ""My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], are you sure you want to do this?"\n"Yes."\n\nAnd that was it. The mages of the Ruby Order performed their unbinding ritual on the crown, in hopes of freeing whatever entity or spirit was trapped within it. It was said that the elf Ioriel, the founder of the House of Siloriel and Mother of Lorent bound her soul to the crown in order to guide the future of the country for the rest of time, and now, hopefully, she would be free.\n\n"The ritual is complete. Did anything happen, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]? Is there anything different?"\n"No. I guess it was a fable after all," you reply."
 flavor_lorent.1.a:0 "I was lying to the mage, of course. Now I am free."
 flavor_lorent.2.t:0 "Resistance to Ravelians"
 flavor_lorent.2.d:0 "The Regent Court clergy in Lencenor have long seen the Corinites as an eastern threat, just as Cannor did to the Greentide. It was, for them, a corruption of the faith. For the Lencori, faith should be an equal part of life, not something that dominates it as the self-righteous Corinites believed.\n\nIt was bad enough that the Corinites sought to redefine what they saw as just and righteous, but now the Ravelian Church, an offshoot of the Corinites, now seek to bring religion to the forefront and control all our actions, and of course: under one central authority... theirs!\n\nEven the most moderate of clerics have voiced concerns of this fundamentalist threat, and have banded together to help defend the realm from further religious upheaval."
 flavor_lorent.2.a:0 "We must survive these changing times."
 flavor_lorent.2.b:0 "If Lencenor changes, so be it."
 flavor_lorent.3.t:0 "The Shofa Protectorate"
 flavor_lorent.3.d:0 "As Lorentish ships became a common sight around Noruin, the bat-nosed elves living there became aware that not all invaders were equal; even to them, it was obvious all respected the power of those bearing the Rose.\n\nThe Shofa tribe has bent the knee to the Bone Citadel for decades, and yet with the Citadel under threat from the Onyx Legion, they feel the winds of change. They turned to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that rules from above a bloody river instead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] who commands the mightiest armies of the world and whose ships blot out the sun, or so they've heard, and humbly requested protection and perhaps less harsh tributes.\n\nWhile they don't have a lot to offer in exchange for our protection, some of our advisors point out it would give us a foothold right next to the rich Trollsbay, and have already nicknamed the territory Núr Ionnidar."
 flavor_lorent.3.a:0 "They shall become a protectorate under the Lorentish crown."
 flavor_lorent.3.b:0 "We have no need of such lowly barbarians."

 incident_the_rose_and_dove:0 "The Rose and Dove"
 incident_the_rose_and_dove_member_alert:0 "The Fourth Lilac War, marked by the betrayal and slaughter of house Silmuna, ended with the creation of a fragile alliance between Lorent and the Wexonard Emperors that temporarily halted further conflicts between Lencenor and Anbennar. When Emperor Lothane sil Wex died, he took with him the political weight that had maintained this Cannorian Detente, and the empire again woke to the threat from Lencenor.\n\nLorent has gone too far. They have taken nearly half of the West Dameshead in their ambitions and shattered previous attempts by Imperial forces to contest them. Their colonial ambitions are hostile to many of the Anbennarian states, and have only empowered their near unstoppable march.\n\nThe heirs of the Ruby Crown threaten to subjugate our western princes. Will we rally the imperial banners to war and liberate the West Dameshead? Or will we run with our tail between our legs as the monarchs of Lorent seek to establish hegemony over Cannor? How will we respond?"

 flavor_lorent.5.t:0 "Bloom of the Lorentish Rose"
 flavor_lorent.5.d:0 "In the years  since Kylian VI Siloreil and Lothane I sil Wex forged their alliance against the Silmunas, relations between us and the Dove Throne have declined. Once allies, the Anbennarians now only hamper our ambitions, contest our rightful claims, and have proven to be far from the ally Emperor Lothane was. Our last war between us and the Empire found us victorious, but it appears that such conquests were a bridge too far for the Dove Throne. This time, the Emperor has called all the imperial banners to reclaim the west."
 flavor_lorent.5.a:0 "They will soon learn that every rose has its thorns."

 flavor_lorent.6.t:0 "Bloom of the Lorentish Rose"
 flavor_lorent.6.d:0 "Our western border has collapsed as the heirs of the Ruby Crown threaten to claim all of West Dameshead. The Imperial Parliament has been called to consider an imperial reclamation to push back the Lorentish hosts."
 flavor_lorent.6.a:0 "Call the imperial banners"
 flavor_lorent.6.b:0 "Abandon the western frontier."

 flavor_lorent.7.t:0 "A fearful Dove"
 flavor_lorent.7.d:0 "Many think of red when they imagine a rose, but in fact the flower has dozens of pigments that can be seen throughout the seasons. Red is emblematic of love, white represents purity, yellow means friendship - a vast amount of hues, each a symbol - each embodied in party by the Lorentish court.\n\nThis month, the black roses are in bloom. They fill Lorent’s hedgerows all along the western approaches from the Dameshead. Black roses represent death in Lencenor, and the black canvas blooming this day is a perfect backdrop on which the blood of imperial soldiers will splatter, satiating the thirsty roots that grow in anticipation of war.\n\nThe Lorentish hosts waited in silence for a month, only the wind sifting through the petals of the battlefield in anticipation of an imperial army cresting over the border on the horizon. But no such army came. The Rose readied the canvas of war, and the Dove chose to leave it blank."
 flavor_lorent.7.a:0 "We blossom unopposed."

 flavor_lorent.8.t:0 "The Crimson Painting"
 flavor_lorent.8.d:0 "Decades ago, the alliance between the late Emperor Lothane and King Kylian VI was sealed with marriages and many gifts and merriments. Of these, one of the greatest was a grand painting of the two men, arms clasped in friendship, standing in the full regalia of their splendid thrones. Painted by imperial artists, it was given by the Anbennarians as a token of friendship, and stood in the Imperial court for decades until, earlier this year, it was ordered removed by a lorentish court increasingly hostile to the interests of the Empire, The denouement of the past complete, the action caught the attention of the Imperial court as they deliberated amongst the Empire’s parliament.\n\nBut [A01.Monarch.GetName] thought nothing of the painting as [A01.Monarch.GetSheHe] feasted with their court advisors, awaiting the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName]’s response and the missive of the imperial parliament. It was not until midnight that the wine-drunk lords of Lorent received an answer to their challenge of imperial sovereignty. A courier arrived bearing a ten foot tall package with the seal of the Empire on its back.\n\n[A01.Monarch.GetTitle] [A01.Monarch.GetName] was the first to sober, [A01.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes wide as the painting was revealed. The painting was of them on the Lorentish throne, thorns of a rose strangling them as a swarm of doves plucked their eyes out while the ruby crown lay shattered at their feet.\n\nAnd the red pigment of the painting…it smelled of iron."
 flavor_lorent.8.a:0 "We broke Adenn Skylance, we will break [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_lorent.8.b:0 "Honor Lothane and his heirs. We have forgotten ourselves."

 flavor_lorent.9.t:0 "The Lorentish Host Flees"
 flavor_lorent.9.d:0 "The Imperial Host split the seas as they crossed the Dameshead. Dozens of banners of every color and heraldic blazon waved beneath the high Penant of the  Imperial Dove as [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] [Emperor.Monarch.GetHimself/Herself] landed with the first wave on the beach. Approaching without caution and with fury at the memory of their broken alliance, the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle]’s righteous anger found no Lorentish soldier on which to visit itself.\n\nThe armies of the empire entered the city of Wesdam and found it empty of any foe, only the peasantry present barricading themselves in their homes as the tension of a possible war was still in the air. Outside the city, the Imperial Commanders found a large set of tracks fleeing west with dozens of roses trampled into the mud."
 flavor_lorent.9.a:0 "The Rose wilted just as quickly as it blossomed."

 flavor_lorent.10.t:0 "§RThe War of the Rose and the Dove§"
 flavor_lorent.10.d:0 "The end of the Lorentish and Imperial alliance was a knife through our heart. But the Empire sees clearly now, their souls filled with duty and resolve to liberate the western princes.\n\nThe Emperor’s threat, sending a gruesome painting of [Lorent.Monarch.GetName] bookended the past of King Kylian VI and Emperor Lothane. Lorentish noble hosts have even started to reinforce the West Dameshead.\n\nWe have rallied the imperial princes and march west with a grand host to liberate our western frontier. We will burn down Lorent’s greater ambitions, the Rose shall wilt to the Dove."
 flavor_lorent.10.a:0 "For the Empire!"

 flavor_lorent.11.t:0 "The Emergency Meeting of the Imperial Parliament"
 flavor_lorent.11.d:0 "Rage. The only word that can describe the palpable and passionate emotion bursting at the seams within the Imperial Parliament. The memory of the alliance between King VI Silorel and Emperor Lothane is distant, but the betrayal stings as if it were yesterday. Those princedoms that stood with the Rose party feel the betrayal the deepest, while those assembled who fought for the Silmuna’s Moon can feel little satisfaction at being proven right about the untrustworthiness of the Lorentish crown.\n\nThe fury at Lorent’s unending aggression into the West Dameshead has seen the Emperor pushed to address the Parliament. Many more meetings throughout the year shall commence, the swarm of Doves fickle and indecisive. But of all the blowhards howling for war, how many of them truly mean what they say?\n\nAnd how will we proceed?"
 flavor_lorent.11.a:0 "No Lorentish King will rule Anbennarian lords!"
 flavor_lorent.11.b:0 "This is just a rush of noise. It will blow over."

 flavor_lorent.12.t:0 "Storming of the Imperial Palace!"
 flavor_lorent.12.d:0 "No imperial relief force would be coming to save the defenders of the Emperor’s capital. The Lorentish Rose had strangled the Empire’s princes, its thorns crippling every army sent to face them. But the Knights of the Orda Aldresia who defended the emperor would not bow to any Lorentish assault on the Imperial Palace, no matter the odds.\n\nFor hours they fought in the city’s streets as the walls were overcome and then breached. Jockeying for control of the city, they ousted the invading Lorentish troops four different times, driving them back to the walls. It was not until they dwindled to barely a thousand defenders that [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] arrived with their personal guard.\n\nThe speech the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] gave is lost to history, but Lorentish soldiers at the siege tell of the fanatical war cry that preceded a last gambit by the defenders. The remaining knights of the Orda Aldresia led by their liege sallied out from the city in a roaring charge against the Lorentish army.\n\nThey carved through a quarter of the enemy’s depth, troop commanders coming to panic as the impossible veered into view. The Rose banner began to waiver as reinforcements sent by [A01.Monarch.GetTitle] [A01.Monarch.GetName] arrived, rallying the Lorentish forces and rushing to meet the raging [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nAccounts say the Emperor of the Doves appeared invincible for a few seconds, slicing through the Lorentish host with ease, striking hesitation into the Lorentish with the furor of the Aldresians behind them - but a single shot from an unknown soldier rang out from the crowded battlefield and struck [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] square in the head, felling them instantly. This sudden reversal shattered the last of the Empire’s resolve, and the remaining Aldresians threw down their weapons around their fallen monarch’s broken form."
 flavor_lorent.12.a:0 "The Rose strangles the Dove."

 flavor_lorent.13.t:0 "Storming of the Lorentish capital!"
 flavor_lorent.13.d:0 "Our march west was a rolling thunderstorm of sword and flintlock as we crossed the Dameshead and liberated Wesdam from the oppressive Lorentish hosts. We shattered army after army until we came into sight of noble Lorentaine standing before the bloodwine rivers and surrounded by the beautiful hedgerows of the kingdom.\n\nThe siege of the city was long and hard lasting months as we starved out the defenders.
