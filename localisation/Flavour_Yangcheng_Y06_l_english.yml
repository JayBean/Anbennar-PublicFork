 yangcheng_yanzhong_proposal_title:0 "The Yanzhong Proposal"
 yangcheng_yanzhong_proposal_desc:0 "Yanzhong has always been our closest ally within the League, as well as our school's greatest sponsor. While already fairly amenable to the unification proposals, a show of goodwill should solidify that. \n\nWe will approach them with an offer regarding the local trade routes, one which is clearly one-sided in their favor. The message will be obvious - we are interested in the goodwill of all."

 yangcheng_sympathetic_officers_title:0 "Sympathetic Officers"
 yangcheng_sympathetic_officers_desc:0 "Guhe has typically been a close friend of the academy, and a considerable number of their military officials hail from our lecture halls. So long as we can maintain a strong diplomatic bond with their state itself, those within their ranks who are sympathetic to our cause should be able to more freely advocate for us."

 yangcheng_reunion_title:0 "The Reunion of 1445"
 yangcheng_reunion_desc:0 "While not an enshrined institution of the school, so-called 'Reunions' are not an uncommon occurence. Oftentimes simple excuses for alumni to drink and mingle with old friends, they nonetheless serve an important role as grounds for much more candid political discussion. \n\nWith plans already in place for such an event to begin soon, the topics of discussion will no doubt turn to the League's current troubles."

 yangcheng_first_yanszin_title:0 "The First Summit"
 yangcheng_first_yanszin_desc:0 "With at least partial support from the rest of the League, it is prudent to at least 'test the waters', as it is often said. Our diplomats do not believe any official solutions will be borne from this gathering, but having open discussion and support on the matter will at least ensure that those not in favor will take the matter seriously."

 yangcheng_second_yanszin_title:0 "The Second Summit"
 yangcheng_second_yanszin_desc:0 "With special projects completed to improve the demeanor of the naysayers, it is finally time to give the Yanszin proposal another try."

 yangcheng_bookends_title:0 "The Bookends"
 yangcheng_bookends_desc:0 "Yingzhen has always been something of an oddity among the League. While the rest of the League finds itself led by the most accomplished graduates and the most experienced statesmen available, the voting in this backwater tends to veer towards the opposite. Those once considered incompetent find greater heights in the government, and... somehow, they tend not to do all too poorly. \n\nCorruption and deceit reign supreme in those lands, and a growing contingent of those investigating the matter believe that the city's power rests not in the Mayor's hands, but in some sinister cabal. Knowing this, some careful planning may leave us able to free the current mayor from these strings - leaving him in our debt."

 yangcheng_future_title:0 "Changing The Future"
 yangcheng_future_desc:0 "Anjiang is perhaps the closest thing to a 'rival' that our state has within the League. Our relations are cordial, of course, but the zealots of that city are far more inclined to listen to the words of their Raheni seers than any measured reason. Nonetheless, with some proper theological debate (as well as the ever-growing consensus among the rest of the League), we may just be able to convince them that the seers' portends support our cause."

 yangcheng_debate_title:0 "Debate Clubs"
 yangcheng_debate_desc:0 "Public debates are a longstanding tradition of the Yangcheng Schools. Argument for its own sake is considered a sort of art, and being able to defend a position which one may not even hold is a well-respected achievement. In the face of our intentions to bring the League closer together, many of our officials believe that even the small act of having our more recognizable figures taking part in some of the more popular debates could assist us in our relations with the rest of the League."

 yancheng_great_school_title:0 "The Great School"
 yancheng_great_school_desc:0 "A proper education is the key to any good administrator, and our growing influence across Yanshen only gives credance to that. As the great university becomes a more ingrained part of the state itself, it has becomes more apparent that its reach must grow with its charge. Even in the far corners of our realm, from the smallest village to the greatest metropolis, an educated and honorable man must lead the way. The facilities of our school must be expanded so that its services are available to all who will have a part in shaping the future."

 yangcheng_dusty_tomes_title:0 "Amidst Dusty Tomes"
 yangcheng_dusty_tomes_desc:0 "There exists a saying throughout central Yanshen, that one who's path in life appears listless and uncertain is 'Chasing Faheng'. It refers to a popular local legend of an ancient, vast gold mine that once existed in the region - one that was destroyed and lost to the ages in the wake of Jaher's invasion, all those years ago. \n\nFor most of recent history, academic consensus has been that the mine never existed and that the legend was but a legend. However, a merchant from Yanzhong recently approached the school bearing a collection of golden ingots bearing an unknown Mark. While this gold is not conclusive proof of anything, a number of scholars have been inspired to open proper efforts to seek the ancient mine - just in case there is truth to it, after all."

 yangcheng_faheng_title:0 "Faheng's Pit"
 yangcheng_faheng_desc:0 "With a considerable number of samples acquired from the surrounding lands, it is time we dedicated resources to the proper analysis of them. Every account must be verified, and every stone must be tested. If the mine exists, there will be traces of it."

 yangcheng_stories_title:0 "Stories In Stone"
 yangcheng_stories_desc:0 "A number of samples from the region to our south seem to indicate the presence of at least some amount of gold. Unfortunately, local records are sparse on the matter. Many of our officials suggest reaching out to some of the few Dwarves in Haless, so that we might employ their expertise."

 yangcheng_restoration_title:0 "Restoration Efforts"
 yangcheng_restoration_desc:0 "After a great deal of testing and covert prospecting, our dwarven friends have identified where they believe the old mine is located. Deep within a collapsed cave in the area known as 'Godou', a few old mining tools have been found - as well as a number of golden nuggets. The area must be taken for our own ends before anyone else can capitalize on our studies."
 
 #Custom TT
 yangcheng_debate_tt:0 "Yangcheng will begin to host public debates. The stances we adopt in these debates will undoubtedly influence our relationships with the rest of the Yanszin."
 yangcheng_pulse_tt:0 "The expansion of the school will periodically bring us benefits."

 #Events
 
 yangcheng.1.t:0 "The Dour Affair"
 yangcheng.1.d:0 "The air was tense in the old hall, as officials from the not-so-far-flung corners of the League mingled and spoke. Some spoke in hushed voices of neighboring countries which may one day provide refuge, or of means by which one could survive conquest unscathed. Others were more belligerent, accusing men from their sister-cities of incompetence and deriding them as the root of all the League's troubles. For even more, though, a somber mood smothered any of the revelries that were customary at a gathering like this one. More than a few of the participants wondered just how many more reunions would ever take place. If this, even, would be the last. \n\nThe League is dying - that much is more than apparent. Perhaps the rulers of Szicheng, ill-fated as they were, saw what was to come. Perhaps their treachery was instead just another near-fatal blow? The wicked men of Jinqiu have tore territory from our grasp, and it is only a matter of time until the other hungry states surrounding us come for the rest. \n\nIf the League of Yanszin is to survive, something drastic must be done."
 yangcheng.1.a:0 "Do we have what it takes?"
 
 yangcheng.2.t:0 "The Gathering at Yanzhong"
 yangcheng.2.d:0 "It was a small blessing to begin with that delegates from all the cities of the League even arrived today, and a much larger one that our work in Yanzhong and Yinzhen has resulted in them supporting the unity proposal. \n\nOf course, few among our scholars expected the same response from the representatives of Guhe and Anjiang - a correct call to make. Neither supported the notion, but this meeting itself has established the concept of unification as a very real goal. \n\nWith this in mind, we can move forward on wooing the two stragglers."
 yangcheng.2.a:0 "Just a little more..."
 
 yangcheng.3.t:0 "A Friend's Plea"
 yangcheng.3.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] recieves a message in secret, hand-delivered by an old acquaintance from the great school of Yangcheng. The message describes an offer from the rulers of the city to assist in throwing off the control of 'whatever power operates in Yingzhen'. How they have discovered this is unclear, and it may even be a trap, but if it is genuine..."
 yangcheng.3.a:0 "Let's give it a try."
 yangcheng.3.b:0 "It's too dangerous."
 
 yangcheng.4.t:0 "Yingzhen's Mayor Accepts!"
 yangcheng.4.d:0 "Urgent news has arrived from Yingzhen today, bearing news both dire and wonderful. Yingzhen's mayor has accepted our offer of support - and is prepared to receive our assistance. \n\nUnfortunately, the emissary claims that the secret has already been discovered by members of the city's court. We must hurry to support the city if we wish to see our plans fulfilled."
 yangcheng.4.a:0 "Good! And also bad!"
 
 yangcheng.5.t:0 "Sinistral Strike"
 yangcheng.5.d:0 "It started as an impromptu riot, spurred on by some mention of a tax reform. Such disquiet was not entirely unexpected, but the growing intensity of the violence was unusual. \n\nAfter the guards failed to quiet the rabble, their true intentions were revealed. Led by a former member of the supposedly ousted 'Sinistral Chamber' that once corrupted Yingzhen, the mob threatens to undo all of our hard work."
 yangcheng.5.a:0 "Keep them down, this time!"
 
 yangcheng.6.t:0 "Change The Future"
 yangcheng.6.d:0 "It took many nights, some more cordial than others, for our theologian to finally convince the seers of our goals of unificiation. Undoubtedly it will take effort to keep them from getting cold feet, but this is a start. \n\nWe can only hope that the damned zealots do not get a message from Tughayasa telling them to do otherwise."
 yangcheng.6.a:0 "Good news, at the very least."
 
 yangcheng.7.t:0 "Golden Mysteries"
 yangcheng.7.d:0 "A great number of streams and creeks flow into our lake, sources all across central Yanshen. While a number of our scholars have busied themselves in old libraries and schoolhouses in search of written records, others have taken to the field with filtered pans in hand. \n\nAfter many weeks in the field, one such team has returned from a small stream to the south, bearing a pouch with three small gold nuggets."
 yangcheng.7.a:0 "Could it be true?"
 
 yangcheng.8.t:0 "On War"
 yangcheng.8.d:0 "A popular debate hall in the University has begun hosting a discussion on the nature of war, and the execution of it. While Yangcheng's official policies tend to leave warfare to the rest of the League, a number of officials from our Sister Cities are participating in the talks. Arguing alongside one of our allies will no doubt ingratiate ourselves with them."
 yangcheng.8.a:0 "We are beset on all sides by our foes - We must be on the offensive, and aggressively secure our goals before we allow weakness to be exploited."
 yangcheng.8.b:0 "The League must be as a fortress, united and protected from those who would harm it."
 yangcheng.8.c:0 "The Diplomat is greater than the warrior. Prosperity and Wealth must be protected by avoiding war however possible."
 
 yangcheng.9.t:0 "Our Place in Yanshen"
 yangcheng.9.d:0 "Discussions in our debate halls have turned to the League's place in the community of Yanshen, and a number of our compatriots from other cities are taking part. Supporting one of their lines of rhetoric will no doubt improve our relations. \n\nWhich line of thought will be argue for?"
 yangcheng.9.a:0 "Order can only reign while we remain a part of the international community. If we resolve struggles with diplomacy, our neighbors will be inclined to do the same."
 yangcheng.9.b:0 "The League must be put above all else, however the most pragmatic way to accomplish this is to maintain positive relations with our neighbors where possible."
 yangcheng.9.c:0 "A state is only ever a moment of weakness away from annihilation. Allies will cast us aside the moment we demand more than we offer - to treat them any differently is foolishness."
 
 yangcheng.10.t:0 "The Ethics of Combat"
 yangcheng.10.d:0 "While discussion on the state's approach to warfare is commonplace in our debate halls, a more peculiar topic has risen today - a soldier's approach to fighting. Officials from our sister-states have already taken part in the arguments, and choosing which to support will have bearing on our relations."
 yangcheng.10.a:0 "The only just war is a short war, and the only short war is one so brutal that neither side wishes to see it continue."
 yangcheng.10.b:0 "Honor is paramount. Treat our foes with mercy, and they will do the same."
 yangcheng.10.c:0 "Our men must come home to their wives and their farms. Warfare must be done as a last resort, and in a manner to preserve our people as possible."
 
 yangcheng.21.t:0 ""
 yangcheng.21.d:0 ""
 yangcheng.21.a:0 ""

 yangcheng.22.t:0 "Breakthrough!"
 yangcheng.22.d:0 "The Xuezhe has recently made a number of very interesting findings - discoveries that can be applied to effectively every part of the state. From improvements to our military industry to keeping our manufactories running efficiently, they have once again given us an edge over our neighbors."
 yangcheng.22.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 yangcheng.23.t:0 "The University Expands"
 yangcheng.23.d:0 "As our reach across Yanshen grows, many of our graduates hailing from the other major cities of the region have come together in hopes of establishing official campuses in other major population centers. One of these efforts has recently borne fruit, with funding being secured for a construction effort."
 yangcheng.23.a:0 "Ever Forward."
 
 yangcheng.24.t:0 "New Graduates"
 yangcheng.24.d:0 "As local populations continue to rise, the study of Urban Planning has become an increasingly popular focus of study for many of those who have come to learn in our schools. In theory, the art is simply determing how to most efficiently use space and plan for expansion, but the all too common result is that such efforts are bogged down by local issues. However, a recent graduating class has proven itself very effective at the art, and we find our work to improve our cities to be at least a little smoother - for now."
 yangcheng.24.a:0 "Let's Make Use of It."
