 flame_custodian_reform_desc:0 "The result of Katouka's of the Undying Flame concentrating all powers of the republic onto himself, the Flame Custodian inherits not only the position of King of Jiantsiang, but also the position of High Priest of the Temple of the Undying Flame and that of Protector, commander of the state's military forces. This allows the Custodian to rule as they see fit, with little to no internal opposition."
 
 # Mission titles and description
 jiantsiang_strike_title:0 "Strike Down the Meek"
 jiantsiang_strike_desc:0 "To our south stands the republic of Zhiqian, a weak state ruled by even weaker eunuchs. While in the past part of our great nation, it was taken from us by the perfidious Jaher in his conquest of Yanshen, the eunuchs kow-towing to the Sun Elven invaders to get into their good graces and be granted autonomy.\n\nNot only is their existence a historical mistake, but they’ve failed in their purpose of defending their populace from the nomad’s raids: Under the rule of the Faceless Queen, the Shuvüüsh invaded to the south, and while we managed to fight them off through sheer grit and brutality thanks to Protector Katouka's commanding skills, while Zhiquian was defeated in battle.\n\nIt is time for us to rectify this, and assume direct control once more, seizing it from those too weak to protect what they have!"
 
 jiantsiang_incompetence_title:0 "Rectifying Incompetence"
 jiantsiang_incompetence_desc:0 "When Zhiquian was invaded by the Shuvüüsh bird riders, it wasn’t only riches and cattle they took with them: They also stole the borderlands, in particular the fortress of Xuanbik, to ensure themselves an easy path to conquest when advancing south.\n\nSo long the area remains in their hands, Yanshen will never be safe from their raids. We must therefore regain control of the area and restore the natural order of things, rectifying Zhiquian’s incompetence."
 
 jiantsiang_swords_title:0 "Land of Swords"
 jiantsiang_swords_desc:0 "The lands Gushuokguan are no stranger to conflict, even if they seldom fight for themselves: A land of exiles and mercenaries, they sell their best warriors to the highest bidder, profiting from the chaos around them if the price is right.\n\nWhile even our great nation has at times employed their services, this practice is detestable, for mercenaries hold no loyalty to the state, and instead only serve themselves. Were we to conquer these lands. their warriors would be put to good use… Under our banner. "
 
 jiantsiang_peasants_title:0 "The Duty Of The Peasants..."
 jiantsiang_peasants_desc:0 "Decades ago, the lands of Lanjinhui were ruled by a tyrant from Jiangdu, the City of Warlords known as Hao Huang. He ruled unjustly and without the consent of the gods or spirits, and he was thus ousted in a long and bloody peasant rebellion, which ended in the establishment of a so-called peasant republic.\n\nWhile justified in their anger against ineffectual rulers, the idea of peasants. organizing themselves is downright repulsive, and must be crushed so that the harmonious natural order of society can continue."
 
 jiantsiang_lords_title:0 "... And Of The Lords"
 jiantsiang_lords_desc:0 "The value of the land is not measured only in its fields and peasants, but also in the quality of its rulers. The lords of Jiangdu learned this the hard way, being faced with overwhelming rebellion and reduced to a rump state. Truth be told, they are impressive warriors, but the decadence that permeated most of Yanshen has also affected them: They grew complacent, ineffective and tyrannical, and lost sight of what their divinely ordained purpose and obligation of rulership truly meant.\n\nIndeed, we must subjugate them and put their military capabilities to good use under banner, while we take care of ruling the land in a just and efficient manner."
 
 jiantsiang_kindling_title:0 "Kindle the Soul"
 jiantsiang_kindling_desc:0 "As our influence spreads southwards, so do our duties. While the river plains of the Yanhe are far away from our home of Jiantsiang, it is our duty as rulers to ensure the prosperity and stability of our newly acquired territories.\n\nTo this end, some in our court have suggested we share the Undying Flame with the temples of Lanjincun, to signal our ruler’s eternal compromise in the defense of these lands, and ensure they never again fall into chaos."
 
 jiantsiang_blazing_title:0 "Blazing Claws"
 jiantsiang_blazing_desc:0 "For centuries, many of our warriors have practiced a technique known as the Blazing Claws. This peculiar fighting style combines martial arts with war magics, allowing Harimari warriors to wield flame as if it was an extension of their own bodies, and resulting in a whirlwind of destruction few are able to withhold.\n\nDespite its effectiveness it is incredibly hard to master, so traditionally very few among our ranks were capable of employing this technique, acting as elite warriors and vanguards. However, with our recent conquest our army has grown in number significantly, to the point where deploying the Blazing Claws as its own separate unit has become viable, a vanguard capable of slicing through enemy lines as if a hot knife through fat."
 
 jiantsiang_undying_title:0 "Kill The Undying"
 jiantsiang_undying_desc:0 "The city of Sising is often referred to as the Undying City, for its people are used to calamity and hardship yet they tread on. While this resilience is admirable, the city is also home to rich salt mines and would therefore be rather useful in supplying our armies for future campaigns. Resilient or not, these lands shall come under our banner.."
 
 jiantsiang_league_title:0 "Splinter The League"
 jiantsiang_league_desc:0 "The League of Yanzsin stands at the heart of trade in Yanshen, halfway through the river Yanhe’s course, a defensive coalition between weak, mercantile city stated puppeteered by eunuchs, an unholy communion between two of the most despicable kinds of people: Corrupt administrators and decadent merchants.\n\nWhile the league was created to deter aggression, and are no strangers to using underhanded tactics to safeguard their interest, they’re not match for a professional, incorruptible army such as ours.We must punish their corruption and endless scheming, and seize their riches for the benefit of our great nation!"
 
 jiantsiang_will_title:0 "Will To Power"
 jiantsiang_will_desc:0 "To our north swells a raging, all-consuming storm. One that seeks to destroy that would be the natural order of things: The nomadic bird riders known as the Shuvüüsh, sworn enemies of our state that have recently all united under the rule of the mysterious Faceless Queen. These savages will stop at nothing less than the total and utter destruction of civilization, and everything we hold dear.\n\nTo our south there is a sea of incompetence, as the weak-willed, corrupt eunuchs that make up most of Yanshen’s ruling class grow ever more decadent and meek, unable to face the ever changing nature of our world and allowing their lands to fall into anarchy.\n\nIt is therefore our duty, nay, our only chance of survival, to right all these wrongs. We shall remain stalwart and face against savagery and decadence alike, and under the guidance of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], we WILL be victorious."
 
 jiantsiang_loyalty_title:0 "The Loyal Few"
 jiantsiang_loyalty_desc:0 "Eunuchs, the ruling class of Yanshen. While coming into power during the great Harimari Empire, they had the gall to think themselves rulers, and crown themselves sovereign of many lands. Traditionally their influence has been the weakest in Jiantsiang, for ours is first and foremost a military frontier.\n\nEven now, they have for the longest time opposed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] ever since [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ascend into power, but recently they’re starting to see the error of their ways and are coming to realize the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] not only is rather competent, but also that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is here to stay. Many are reconsidering where their loyalties lie…"
 
 jiantsiang_spears_title:0 "Sea Of Spears"
 jiantsiang_spears_desc:0 "The people of Beikdugang are strange, preferring the sea to the land and originally hailing from the mysterious country far to the north, where the Treasure Fleets are from. And therefore, even their government is strange: For their rulers are not administrators, or even soldiers, but instead… Merchants.\n\nWhile there is nothing wrong with wealth and prosperity, mercantile people are extremely decadent and corruptible, seeking profit as opposed to governing with any modicum of righteousness or justice. It is then our duty to put an end to this mockery of a state, and take dominion of the Sea of Spears by force."
 
 jiantsiang_crossing_title:0 "Crossing The Yanhe"
 jiantsiang_crossing_desc:0 "The Yanhe, the great river that goes through most of Yanshen, is perhaps its most defining geographical feature, apart from its economic lifeblood as source of bountiful harvest and trade. But most importantly, it has been where Jiantsiang’s borders ended, even at its greatest extent as our forefathers never once managed to conquer beyond the river’s shores, instead being contained to the north. In honor of our ancestors, we shall march further than any of them did, and bring order and harmony to the south."
 
 jiantsiang_sons_title:0 "True Sons Of Harimar"
 jiantsiang_sons_desc:0 "The lordship of Zongji is ruled by the last living descendants of Harimar the Great, conqueror of Yanshen: The dynasty of the Divine Call. However, they’re a pale shadow of his renowned ancestor: Not only have they grown powerless and lazy by wily eunuchs, but also try to implement a mockery of the already detestable Raheni caste system.\n\nNot only is this form of rule foreign to Yanshen, but also stifles meritocracy and promotes corruption at its most fundamental level, but ensuring people are born and die in their post, with no chance for social development. We must put an end to this, and claim ourselves the true heirs of Harimar, by right of conquest."
 
 jiantsiang_lucky_title:0 "Bringers Of Good Fortune"
 jiantsiang_lucky_desc:0 "The Golden Kobolds are often considered to be bringers of good luck in folk tradition, and are therefore considered honored guests in our court. However, there is also a very fundamental issue: Our rivals also have access to this good fortune. We must therefore incorporate the kobold temples into our great state, so that we can distribute said luck as we see fit."
 
 jiantsiang_protector_title:0 "Protector and Dictator"
 jiantsiang_protector_desc:0 "While our Protector, Kataouka of the Undying Flame has promised to save Jiantsiang from the darkness and face against the nomads that threaten our borders and the rot that afflicts our nation, one can never fight while guarding their own backs. We must put our own state’s affairs in order, before taking any external actions, even if this could mean compromising without detractors… Or employing drastic measures .\n\nThe duty of governorship is one that requires apt decision making, after all."
 
 jiantsiang_men_title:0 "Hard Times, Strong Men"
 jiantsiang_men_desc:0 "While the situation is now under control, having strengthened our army, our government, and our borders, we must now move onto the issue of preventing such a situation from ever happening again. Citing a need to wholly reform our nation, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to invoke extraordinary powers. Such a move is certain to alienate our detractors, and force them to show their hands… Let them come. The Undying Flame burns eternal"
 
 jiantsiang_paw_title:0 "An Iron Paw"
 jiantsiang_paw_desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has finally understood where the weakness of our great nation lies: Infighting, disparate voices, corruption… So long everyone works towards their own gain and not that of the state, trying to seize the position of Protector for themselves, we will be condemned to irrelevancy, a frontier state vulnerable to the never ending raids of the barbarians to our north.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way. The Republic of Jiantsiang be no more, and in its place, the Kingdom of Jiantsiang will be born, for the blood of Ahan flows through our veins, [Root.Monarch.GetName] acting as both King and Custodian of the Undying Flame, therefore being the highest secular and religious authority in our great nation.\n\nSo long the Undying Flame burns, Jiantsiang will never fall. And so long our Custodian leads us, the flame shall not fade."
 
 jiantsiang_tianlou_title:0 "The Jewel Of Yanshen"
 jiantsiang_tianlou_desc:0 "Tianlou, O Tianlou!\n\nCity of cities, Desire of Conquerors, Of a Thousand Temples, Jewel of the East, Crucible of Trade, City of Scholars, Philosophers and Monks, of Eternal Splendor!\n\nHow low hast thou fallen, reduced to a pitiful den of merchants and eunuchs, your once imperial halls now fractured and broken, what was a shining beacon of civilisation now the center of the rot and decadence that plagues Yanshen!\n\nBut this is no reason for despair, for what was once broken can be repaired. We shall seize the city for our own, and rebuild it in our image… The future capital of our New Empire!"
 
 jiantsiang_purge_title:0 "Trial By Fire"
 jiantsiang_purge_desc:0 "Before we can even consider moving the court to Tianlou, we must first cull the rot that has taken hold in the city: the Xuezhefang, what is considered the ‘greatest’ eunuch academy in all of Yanshen. We must once and for all dispel their unnatural belief that eunuchs are somehow deserving of rulership, and instead instill the idea that eunuchs were made to be subservient.\n\nTo this end, we shall perform an exam akin to those they like to take so much in the academy, but its purpose will be slightly different: Instead of asking about administration or history, we shall instead force them to choose among themselves who are the most corrupt, most rebellious of their kin. Once we are done, any notion of unity among their rank will be crushed, and we will know exactly who to punish…"
 
 jiantsiang_ancients_title:0 "Force Of Ancients"
 jiantsiang_ancients_desc:0 "Now that all is set, we need only prepare Tianlou for the arrival of our court to the Divine Call palace, but there is a small issue. Many of our advisors have pointed out that this might greatly upset the balance of power of our nation, and that many cities might feel sidelined by our administration with this move.\n\nSo that harmony is preserved, we must first preserve balance by empowering other cities further, and that way ensuring our might is evenly spread and capable of reaching our entire great nation."
 
 jiantsiang_sanctum_title:0 "Enter The Inner Sanctum"
 jiantsiang_sanctum_desc:0 "The Inner Sanctum of the High Temples of Tianlou, the most sacred ground in all of Yanshen and beyond, where the High Gods once lived... And perhaps even more interestingly, the last place where Harimar was seen, as he ventured inside to uncover the mysteries of the Gods, before mysteriously disappearing from history…\n\nOur brave [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decided to enter the Sanctum to commune with the High Gods and uncover these mysteries and for all, and perhaps, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own will be revealed to them..."
 
 jiantsiang_defenders_title:0 "Defenders Of The North"
 jiantsiang_defenders_desc:0 "For two thousand years, the Shuvüüsh have attempted to conquer Yanshen, and destroy civilization.\n\nAnd for two thousand years, Jiantsiang has held the line, defiant.\n\nThe Shuvüüsh are a nomadic people, humans who traverse the steppe atop their fearsome terror birds, which they use as mounts and weapons of war against us civilised folk. Ever since we have recorded records, they do not sow, they do not create, and they do not engage in diplomacy, no: Their objective has always been the utter annihilation of everything that is orderly and civilized in this world, seeking to pillage, burn and destroy everything in their wake, as a tide of pure evil.\n\nIt is no wonder all our efforts, all our energies, must be directed to containing this tide of darkness… And if possible, put an end to it, once and for all."
 
 jiantsiang_wilds_title:0 "The Outer Wilds"
 jiantsiang_wilds_desc:0 "Since we’ve been on the defensive for most of our history, we never had the need (or desire) to venture into the north, the Shuvüüsh homeland. We’ve thoroughly unimpressed, encountering only steppe, deserts, and the occasional angry village in need of pacification. As such, our men have begun calling these lands ‘the Outer Wilds’, uncivilized wilderness far from home where our soldiers are always one slip away from death. Regardless of this, we must establish a permanent presence there and subjugate the bird riders."
 
 jiantsiang_shattering_title:0 "Shatter Their Spirit"
 jiantsiang_shattering_desc:0 "The conquest of the whole Shuvüüshudi, the homeland of the Shuvüüsh people, has been a great accomplishment… However, to defeat them militarily is only half the battle. We must ensure they never again threaten our great state and civilisation at large.\n\nIndeed, even if they’re barbaric, they must be integrated into our state by force, shattering their spirit and will to fight by any means necessary."
 
 jiantsiang_bay_title:0 "Dominate The Bay"
 jiantsiang_bay_desc:0 "While the city of Tianlou itself is under our control, the bay itself is still out of our reach. While these lands lack the wealth and prosperity of the city, they are nonetheless instrumental in dominating the trade flowing in and out of the region. Let us better organize this trade so it can all be properly categorized, taxed, and works in the benefit of our great state."
 
 jiantsiang_prosperity_title:0 "Resplendent Prosperity"
 jiantsiang_prosperity_desc:0 "Most scholars agree, the prosperity of a nation is directly correlated to the quality of its rulers: Rulers who are corrupt and decadent in turn are punished by the High Gods, their lands suffering famine and chaos, while rulers who are virtuous and just are rewarded with bountiful harvests and prosperous subjects. Therefore, poverty reflects poorly on our government.\n\nWhile our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has suggested making being poor illegal (As it is, indirectly, an insult against their rule), some of our advisors instead urge us to proceed with several policies and investments in order to make our great state even more prosperous, and thus prove our ruler’s righteousness to all!"
 
 jiantsiang_divinity_title:0 "Shards of Divinity"
 jiantsiang_divinity_desc:0 "Now we've collected a significant number of relics, we must now put them to good use. Their arcane energies are far more advanced than anything we’ve encountered prior, revealing their authenticity as trinkets of the High Gods. We must therefore allocate both our mightiest mages and wisest philosophers to the task of studying them, as a heightened understanding of the divine will doubtless benefit out great state."
 
 jiantsiang_raids_title:0 "An End To The Raids"
 jiantsiang_raids_desc:0 "While many are content with only defending our borders, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sees the need to take it a step further, and instead push the frontier. Such a move is seen by many as reckless and ultimately pointless, as the steppe is thought to be utterly ungovernable, but the logic is rather sound: If we establish a military presence in the drylands to our west and fortify them, we could use strategic depth against the nomads, becoming an impenetrable bastion against their raids. Furthermore, these lands are suitable for agriculture, and might therefore be fit for settlement… Once its original inhabitants have faced justice for their crimes, that is."
 
 jiantsiang_steppe_title:0 "To Tame The Steppe"
 jiantsiang_steppe_desc:0 "This land might be wild and relentless, yet it can, and will, be tamed. By constructing fortifications in the central regions, and by offering criminals to choose between the death sentence and becoming settlers to reinforce our newly acquired territories, we have found a steady supply of colonists to populate the area, and in turn weaken the Shuvüüsh grip over it. Civilisation, in its most ruthless form, shall come, one way or another."
 
 jiantsiang_east_title:0 "Relentless Push East"
 jiantsiang_east_desc:0 "The lands to our east are not conducive to our conquest: It is an amalgamation of deserts, steppe and frozen woodland, sparsely populated even by the north’s standards.\n\nHowever, if we wish for our victory over the nomads to be definitive, we mustn’t allow them to regroup under a new warlord outside our reach. Some might see it as a waste of resources, but so long as they're allowed to be independent, the Shuvüüsh will pose a threat. Such a thing won’t be allowed to pass."
 
 jiantsiang_kingdom_title:0 "All Within The Kingdom"
 jiantsiang_kingdom_desc:0 "Our victory over the nomads must be absolute. No matter how expansive the valley, field or desert, all must fall under our control. From the smallest clan to the largest host, all shall bow down to the Undying Flame, and be integrated into our great state.\n\nTo try and put their inherent abilities to good use, we shall press the youngest generation of Shuvüüsh into military service, being tutored by harimari officers and shaped into soldiers for our army, to serve as auxiliaries. The training might be perilous, but if they succeed, they would’ve definitely integrated into our society… And if they die, it’s one less barbarian to worry about."
 
 jiantsiang_gate_title:0 "Kick Down The Gates..."
 jiantsiang_gate_desc:0 "Until not so long ago, the Hermit Kingdom of Daengun was a collection of petty warlords embroiled in a bloody civil war for control of the easternmost coast of Haless. Isolated from outside influence, not influenced by wily eunuchs and having fought the nomads for decades, we initially thought of them as a potential equal to our great state.\n\nWe were, however, sorely mistaken.\n\nNot only is Daengun rotting from within, as decades of strife have made it so the kingdom suffers from the most abject factionalism, but our scholars have informed us that it was they who in the days of yore gave the Shuvüüsh their first terror birds as a gift. This might’ve happened centuries ago, but it was us who had to deal with the consequences of their actions, and it was us who finally fixed it by dominating the nomads… And it provides us with a magnificent excuse to put them in their place, positioning ourselves as the true Hegemon of the North.\n\nLet us march on their capital city of Jaengujan, in a punitive expedition they shall not forget!"
 
 jiantsiang_tumbling_title:0 "... And It Will Crash Down"
 jiantsiang_tumbling_desc:0 "Once a snake has been beheaded, the rest of the body might cling to life for seconds, sometimes even minutes, before finally dying.\n\nThis is true for states, as well. While we have occupied their capital and punished them as we saw fit, the rest of their kingdom resists our inevitable conquest for the moment. We shall show them that resistance is futile."
 
 jiantsiang_treasure_title:0 "The Greatest Treasure"
 jiantsiang_treasure_desc:0 "Sometimes small relics of the High Gods are found in their temple complexes or ruins, small trinkets filled to the brim with arcane energy which can be studied and wielded by experienced mages. While they are rather rare in Yanshen, the people of Daengun have told us that to the north there is the island of Somyonghon said to be filled to the brim with relics… And evil spirits. Evil spirits or not, these sacred relics must be put to good use by our great state, lest it falls in the wrong hands"

While in the latest Shuvüüsh invasion in which Zhiqian to our south failed to hold their fortifications, ours stood firm thanks to the heroic actions of the commander of our great army, Katouka of the Undying Flame, who managed to best the Faceless Queen in the battlefield and repel the birdriders’ attack.\n\nConsidered a war hero by many, the council has decided to name him Protector until the threat of invasion subsides, granting him dictatorial power over our great state.
