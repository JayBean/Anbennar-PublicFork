 thirabnir_2_1_title:0 "A Lesson On War"
 thirabnir_2_1_desc:0 "'A great general is a master of tactics, knowing how to exploit the enemy while mitigating his own weaknesses to reach a favorable outcome before a single drop of blood is spilled.'\n\n'A great warrior makes his presence known across the battlefield, striking fear into the hearts of his enemies and driving courage into  his compatriots with mastery of arms.'\n\nFrom “The Sword” by Narai Chaiya\n\nWhen the townships of the Kai were attacked, we did nothing, for we had a deal with Hiderion that we would not interfere nor take advantage of the situation. We sat idle, biding our time and paying lip service to the elven lord of Azkare, for we know that a storm is brewing. \nWhile we are blessed with capable leadership, it would be foolish to go alone against the veteran armies of the other townships. If we want to weather this crisis, we should look abroad for the experienced muscle that could turn the balance in our favour."

 thirabnir_2_3_title:0 "War Across The River"
 thirabnir_2_3_desc:0 "‘War should never be the first course of action of a ruler. It is a gamble which sometimes bears fruit, yet always costs both sides valuable resources.’\n\n‘Diplomacy, or war by means of the pen can bear the same results without risking a conflict. One who can fight with words, can defeat their enemies without the need of a blade.’\n\nFrom “The Sword” by Narai Chaiya\n\nThe War for the Mantle of Baihon Xinh has caused a shift in power in the eastern Thidinkai. Both sides would like to see us become yet another pawn in their game. We should engage in playing both sides off each other, to ensure this conflict stays out of Thirabnir until we can handle it later."

 thirabnir_3_1_title:0 "A Lesson On Learning"
 thirabnir_3_1_desc:0 "‘A foolish ruler surrounds themselves with other fools, forming a cloud of delusion, detached from reality. They might be brave, yet they shall doom themselves by making the worst decisions possible.’\n\n‘A weak ruler surrounds itself with yesmen, who do nothing but cement the fears or arrogance of their lord. They might be the most convienient, yet they shall doom themselves by making the most stubborn and predictable decisions possible.’\n\n‘A good ruler surrounds themselves with those who help their liege evolve. Because those who listen will hear everything in their surroundings while those who talk, only hear themselves.’\n\nFrom “The State” by Narai Chaiya\n\nIf we are to survive in these trying times, then we must be open to the world around us. We must learn from friends and enemies alike and change our strategies and plans if need be, lest we risk falling into decadence. While some of this may be delegated to our estates, our ruler should also reach out to expand his pool of knowledge with new encounters and experiences."

 thirabnir_3_2_title:0 "Mercy Upon The Defeated"
 thirabnir_3_2_desc:0 "‘A wise farmer once taught the following lesson: When one tends to the fields, they dread not just insects and disease, but the opportunistic crow as well. These birds can wreak havoc upon one's fields, yet they can also make useful allies.\nIf one fills bowls with seeds and gifts these to the crows, they will not only stay away from the field, but also attack other animals and pests that come close to the field, the farmer and their food. They become allies of the farmer and vice versa.’\n\nFrom “The State” by Narai Chaiya\n\nA good ruler is like the farmer, they do not oppress or attack their vassals, but offer them security and stability in exchange for their loyalty. By letting the other Townships enjoy their autonomy and security, we can bind them to our rule and prevent them from revolting or plotting against our interests, while they can provide us with benefits such as their claims on common enemies."

 thirabnir_3_4_title:0 "Thangoya Secured"
 thirabnir_3_4_desc:0 "We were not the first to start this chain of violence. In fact, we weren't keen on the idea of joining in at first, watching as our brethren bleeded out, bickering over whose ambitions would take the lead. But as the situation reached the breaking point, we were forced to intervene. The Townships stand now beneath our feet, their honor stained, but they seem to like our leadership, at least for now. If there is anything that this period of strife showed, then it is that it should never repeat again. A new system has to be made, without exploitation of one group over another, to make way for a true Sikai identity."

 thirabnir_4_1_title:0 "A Lesson of Peace"
 thirabnir_4_1_desc:0 "‘One who is prepared for war knows that someday, they will be at peace again and that the nation should be able to thrive when that happens. One who is prepared for peace knows that this can sometimes be achieved only through war and should prepare to face his foes accordingly.’\n\nFrom “The Soul” by Narai Chaiya\n\nWhile the truce between Townships still stands, it is clear that both sides are too ambitious to be satisfied by concluding their conflict, looking to consolidate all under their yoke. We must prepare for this accordingly, so we can come back to enjoying times of peace unscathed. We must consult our closest advisors and gain allies wherever we can find them to strengthen ourselves for the battles to come. To succeed is to prepare."

 thirabnir_4_2_title:0 "Give and Take"
 thirabnir_4_2_desc:0 "‘To achieve peace, one needs the basics. Food to nourish the stomach, shelter to nourish the body, faith to nourish the soul.’\n\nFrom “The Soul” by Narai Chaiya\n\nOur nation is split in two distinctive regions. One are the grassy plains in Haiban and Kesanthi while the other are the provinces of Sikhawlom and Masanthi, which suffer from the harsh environment of its desert, with many of its people living in poverty. We shall organize and coordinate grand pilgrimages to the local ruins of the High Temple in Masanthi to honor and remember the ancestors who fell to the harsh conditions of the desert, while hopefully improving the economic situation of the province."

 thirabnir_4_3_title:0 "City of Adventurers"
 thirabnir_4_3_desc:0 "‘A peasant fights to protect their family, a craftsman fights to protect their wares, a noble fights to protect their honor and an adventurer fights for the highest bidder.’\n\nFrom “The Soul” by Narai Chaiya\n\nOur city of Haiban was once a great entrepot of adventurers who went near and far looking for mercenary work or to help local rulers get rid of problematic folk and the occasional monster or spirit. Sadly it experienced neglect from prior lords, who focused their attention more on their seat of power in Kesanthi. We shall make due with the city of Haiban and reinstate it as a hub for those who fight the everyday evil once more, strengthening not only our internal security but also giving us the opportunity to grow our manpower pool in preparation of wars to come."

 thirabnir_event.1.t:0 "The Legacy of Lord Narai Chaiya"
 thirabnir_event.1.d:0 "Almost 5 decades ago, a young man with a dream set out to change the world. A nearly unknown advisor to Tonan Pruakong of Azkare, he was determined to run for the Lordship of the poor and underdeveloped Thirabnir. He wasn’t known amongst the people of the area, and at first his candidacy was ignored by most. But he was a man who knew how to communicate his vision. A one man campaign, he travelled from town to town, securing patrons and following with his oratory skills. To the surprise of everyone, he managed to win. \n\nStill consolidating his political standing, the new Lord hit the ground running by dismantling the corrupt cliques that partitioned the state. With the support of his many patrons, he removed the decadent generals and reformed the structures of the army, putting the security of the borders back in place and repelling Rongbeki raids. \n\nWith the state secured and none to oppose him internally, the man set out to make reforms. The previously poor communities of Sikhawlom desert, the most remote area of the country, received the monopoly on the salt trade, allowing them to profit off their own land and earning a fair living. The profits of the trade attracted many merchants to Haiban, the famed City of Adventurers, and sparked a new golden age for a city that was losing value against the much larger metropoli of Lapnam Amrik or Ma Hoang.\nAmicable relations were established with the resurgent Baihon Xinh and the Nephrite Dwarves, guaranteeing peace on every border until Hiderion’s War. \nThese changes, the hard work of one man and many, blurred by over the course of a lifetime. So much changed so fast that it all seemed a dream. And now it was time to wake up. \n\nToday, thousands flock in silence to Yemak cemetery, as they follow a sarcophagus. It is towering over the crowd, covered by a Khanvuphaim baldachim, its wooden coffin ornamented with pure silver and carried by the most beautiful steeds. The atmosphere around it is hollow, as a queue stretching beyond the horizon followed the body on its journey.\nPeasants and nobles clothed in simple robes, marching in a simple drum-led rhythm, accompanied by silent sobbing, came with their beloved Lord on his last march. \nAs they reached their destination, each visitor allowed a 5 minute conversation. They burn the spirit paper to protect his soul and after making their parting worlds, they leave, having finished their last audience with their beloved Lord Narai. \nThis went on for seven days and seven nights. This was how all mourned the death of the great lord of Thirabnir, before he was laid down into his final resting place."
