 string_start_bulwar_primer:0 "§OPrimer§!\nRumored to be the cradle of human civilization, §YBulwar§! is a land of fallen empires and near constant struggle. From the ancient §lAge of God-Kings§!, during which humans overthrew the genies thanks to the magic taught by §YBrasan§! and installed themselves as kings in their place, to the §YKarqašlu Empire§! of the horse riders from the §YForbidden Plains§! and the monstrous kingdoms of the gnolls and harpies during the §lAge of Monsters§!, Bulwar has been, for the majority of its history, dominated by foreign invaders. In its later period it was controlled by the likes of §YCastanor§!, §YDameria§!, and §YKheterata§!.\n\n§YJaher’s§! landing in 1001 AA saw the humans freed from gnollish tyranny and unified. §YJaher§! would be labelled as §YSurakel§! reborn by the §YNew Sun Cult§!. He would go on to conquer §YDostanor§! and §YBusinor§! and then the lands to the east all the way to the §YRinglet Sea§!, forming the first §YPhoenix Empire§!. Upon his assassination in 1127 AA, §YThe Sunset Wars§! began in which the inhabitants of the §YYanshen§! and §YRahen§! regions rebelled and broke away from the empire. §YJaher’s§! daughter §YJexis§! would grow up to reconquer the empire’s western holdings and push all the way to the §YDameshead§! forming the second §YPhoenix Empire§!. She was assassinated in 1162 AA and the empire collapsed again. The remaining Phoenix Legions returned from the west to find a fractured Bulwar and decided to head further east, into the desert."
 string_start_deepwoods_primer:0 "§OPrimer§!\nFor thousands of years, the mysterious forest known as §Ythe Deepwoods§! has been a source of superstition, mystery, and academic consternation. Inexorably connected to §Ythe Feyrealm§!, the ancient forest is steeped in confounding magics and is the home of many things bizarre and inexplicable. The most famous example of this was a powerful ward known as §Ythe Verdant Veil§!, which encompassed the forest during §Rthe Day of Ashen Skies§! and prevented those who entered the Deepwoods from leaving, seemingly lost forever in the verdant undergrowth.\n\nFor over a thousand years the Verdant Veil would ensnare and claim many mortals - from curious clans of Cave Goblins to brave Moon Elves fighting the Sorcerer-King and even Green Orcs from the Greentide, any who ventured into the woods became trapped with no indication that it would release its prisoners. The Deepwoods was a bubble, enclosed and sealed off from the rest of Cannor, and there was no indication that this would ever change.\n\nThis status quo was broken when §YCorin§!, avatar of the fallen god Agrados, and her closest companions entered the Deepwoods in 1443. Within, she encountered the Forest Goblins and Wood Elves, descendants of those lost in the woods long ago, as well as the lost orcish clans of the Greentide. Alongside the Wood Elven mage §YArun Drennen§! and the Goblin warlock §YOubblig§!, Corin and her companions discover the source of the Verdant Veil - an archfey known as §Ythe Eldest§!. They tracked and defeated the ancient creature and shattered the Veil, freeing the inhabitants of the Deepwoods and opening the woods to the wider world once more."

 string_start_lorent:0 "§g\"On my honour, I swear eternal love and allegiance to the Rose, the King, and to the Four Virtues of Lady Ioriel."\n-Final verse of the Lorentish Knight's Vow§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nLorent has sat as the rightful sovereign of Western Cannor (known as §YLencenor§!) since long before the arrival of the elves in 1000 AA.\nIt is a country famed for its etiquette, bountiful vineyards and romantic tales of chivalry, but also as one of the §YGreat Powers of Cannor§!, competing with §YGawed§! to the north and the §YEmpire of Anbennar§! to the east for dominion over the continent of §YCannor§!.\n\nThe kingdom owes its inception and name to §YLorenan the Great§!, an ancient human king who famously defeated the invading §YAlenic§! ancestors of its now-rival §YGawed§! during the chaos of the §YDragonwake§! in 470. In much recent history, however, Lorent has become known as a great adopter of elven culture and customs, falling under the guidance of the elf §YIoriel§! in 1022, the wife of then King §YRuben II§!, leading to Lorent becoming the cultural and military superpower it is today.\n\nThe country is divided into two primary cultures: §YHigh Lorentish§! (the half-elven nobility and urban human class who have fully embraced the elven ways) and the §YLow Lorentish§! (the rural backbone of the country who are still predominantly human, though more accepting of the elvenized customs than its other human counterparts elsewhere). In terms of other races, Lorent has long acted as suzerain for the §YRedfoot Halflings§! of the southern §YSmall Country§!, and maintains close relations with its ancient §YRuby Dwarf§! neighbours of §YRubyhold§!. The §YElfrealm§! of the §YRedglades§! also lies under Lorentish control, a woodland sanctuary established by Ioriel herself.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLilac Wars§! (1348-1443) between Lorent and Anbennar has brought the kingdom to its knees. And while Lorent did emerge victorious, destroying the §YHouse of Silmuna§! and preventing them from holding the imperial throne ever again, §YKylian VI§! now finds himself at a fragile peace at home. The war saw Lorent's most powerful vassals, the §YWine Lords§! of §YMadelaire, Eilísin,§! and §YRubenaire§!, side with the Silmuna, and despite the war's end, they have now refused to swear fealty to their rightful overlord, eroding the authority of the Lorentish crown.\n\nTo the east, Lorent has installed its ally, §YLothane, the Grand Duke of Wex§!, on the imperial throne of Anbennar. In the name of unity, Kylian has wed his sister to this new emperor, hoping to use dynastic ties to control the Empire of Anbennar from within, but only time will tell if this is a match meant to last, now that the House of Silmuna, the enemy of their enemy, is no more.\n\nTo the north, the halfling §YSmall Country§! remains calm yet divided between Lorent and its eternal rival, §YGawed§!. Peace never lasts, however, and as Lorent looks to recover from the Lilac Wars, the northern eagle of Gawed begins to look south once again like the days of §YLorenan the Great§!."

 string_start_title_wesdam:0 "The Marquisate of Wesdam"
 string_start_wesdam:0 "§g"No one knows what to make of the young Marquis. He seems competent, but the mind of a child can become many things."§!\n-Cevis Orthosmere, half-elven tutor of Laurens Silmuna, November 11th, 1444\n\n§OPrimer§!\nThe Duchy of Wesdam was created from de jure §YCarnetori Kingdom§! lands by the §YKingdom of Carneter-Dameria§!. This was since the Damerian Kingdom was theoretically an elected role, whereas the Carnetori Kingdom was not, and was ruled by the Lorenti House of §YRubentis§! at the time. After the decline of the Rubentis in 898 and the rise of its cadet house, the House of §YDameris§!, to the throne of Carneter-Dameria, the duchy was eventually given to their loyal follower §YWilliam the Westward§!, who would found the House of Wesdam.\n\nWesdam did little of note before the founding of the Empire of Anbennar, when it was designated a Marquisate and a military frontier against the kings of §YLorent§!. The family §Ysíl Wesdam§!, the holders of the title of Dukes, then became the Marquis of Wesdam. With this newfound prestige, the síl Wesdam family married into the great Silver House of §YSilmuna§!, becoming a cadet branch of the family. For hundreds of years, the family of Silmuna-Wesdam ruled the Marquisate, but slowly began to chafe under the overlordship of their relatives, who treated them as simply vassals rather than family.\n\n§ORecent History§!\n§g"Vincen and Adénn have made it clear I mean nothing to them. So I am happy to replace them." -Marion síl Silmuna-Wesdam§!\n\nWhen the §YLilac Wars§! began in 1348, following the election of §YReán Siloriel§!, King of Lorent to the Imperial throne, Wesdam at first threw their lot in with their Silmuna brethren. However, with the third war beginning in 1407, there was a shift in attitude within Wesdam. Throughout the war, §YAdénn Skylance§! treated the Wesdamerian branch of his family and their holdings as a pawn in his battles against the Lorentish, and the war had a grueling cost to the people of Wesdam, which acted as the site of many notable battles.\n\nThis came to a head when Adénn demanded that Marion give him control of the Wesdam military and other concessions, citing that he was Marion's feudal lord. This brashness pushed Marion over the edge, and he reached out to the Lorentish to make a deal. Promising to grant the Marquis the throne of Dameria in exchange for his loyalty, in 1409, at a battle known as the §YTreachery of Wesdam§!, the Wesdam army and a cadre of Lorentish knights routed the Imperial army, with only a quarter escaping. Following this, Marion helped plan the §YBattle of the Moon Council§!, orchestrating the election of §YLothane síl Wex§! as the emperor. However, he died of plague soon after, which many believed was a punishment for treachery against his kin.\n\nHis heir, §YCristof§!, would prove an even more fascinating figure, eloping with the §YDuchess of Madelaire, Reánna§!, defying noble conventions regarding marriage and courting. He would die before the war finished, leaving his son §YErlan§! as ruler. Erlan would then die during the siege of the Imperial Capital Anbenncóst, in the war's dying days, after slaying Adénn Skylance.\n\nHe would leave behind his six-year-old brother Laurens as Marquis under their mother's regency. Wesdam now sits in limbo, without direction. Laurens can follow one of two paths: his Lorentish blood from his Wine Lord mother or his Damerian heritage. Wesdam has made many decisions over the past centuries that have reshaped their fate and that of Cannor, this will undoubtedly be the same."

 string_start_title_reveria:0 "Reveria, the Reavers stuck in the middle."
 string_start_reveria:0 "§g\"The Lorentish don't fear breaching the Portroy Agreement, but they do fear being breached by our axes!"\n-Famous part of King Lothane III's inauguration speech§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nReveria is a kingdom formed during the §YEra of Black Ice§! (768 - 978 A.A.) by Reavers from Gerudia who raided and ultimately settled these lands. The kingdom itself, along with its ancient dynasty and capital, owes its name to this ancestry.\n\nReveria is famous for its fearsome warriors and distinct culture, which is a unique mix between §YGerudian§! and §YLencori§! traditions and customs. The state has legally secured its southern border by forcing the §YLorentish§! to sign the §YPortroy Agreement§! in their moment of weakness during the Era of Black Ice, ensuring the land this side of the Portroy river belongs to Reveria. Reveria has both halfling and gnome minorities in its current domain but used to rule over a vaste swathe of originally-gnomish land provinces back when the §YGnomish Pass§! was still under their control.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe northern border is a volatile one. For hundreds of years the Reverians have had tense relations with the kobolds through their previous border in the Gnomish Pass. Although Reveria has ruled over the Gnomish Pass for centuries, it has been wrested from their control by the §YCliff Gnomes§! of §YNimscodd§! in 1396, when they had the support of the §YGawedis§!. Reconquering the Gnomish Pass has been the first item on any agenda ever since.\n\nIf Reveria is to survive the ages, it will have to either carefully maintain the balance between itself and the two giants of §YLorent§! and §YGawed§! or uproot that balance entirely, coming out on top. Who Reveria ends up allying themselves to is perhaps the greatest decision one can make: will they seek allies in the south, where they have supported the §YLorentish§! in the §YLilac Wars§! not a year prior, using a thankful §YLorent§! to cement an alliance? Or will Reveria align itself with §YGawed§!, who they have fought against as recently as 1396 but is the only viable option to defend oneself against §YLorent§!?\n\nReveria is approaching a tumultuous time with no heir to the throne, an old king, a war against the gnomes on the horizon and nothing but their axes to hold §YGawed§! and §YLorent§! at bay."

 string_start_nimscodd_description:0 "§OPrimer§!\nThe gnomish people long called the mountains and hills of the §YDragonheights§! their home. Isolated and safe, for many centuries the gnomes had little dealing with what they saw as barbaric §Yhumans§! and §Yhalflings§! in the muggy plains to the east and south. Over time, many gnomes ventured south towards the coast, forming new urban centers, which became thriving city-states.\n\nBy the 12th century BA these city-states had united to form the §YGnomish Hierarchy§!, one of the ancient empires of antiquity, alongside §YCastanor§! and the §YKingdom of Kheterata§!; between these three great powers Western Cannor was divided up, with the Gnomish Hierarchy subjugating the human and halfling tribes of the §YSmall Country§!, and laying the foundations for §YBeepeck§!.\n\nWith mercantile prowess and technological cunning, the Hierarchy assisted in the colonization of the Dameshead, helping to build both §YVertesk§! and §YDamenath§!. It supported the §YDamerian Republic§! in the §YWar of the Cerulean League§!, though that alliance would be short-lived and the Hierarchy would find itself at war with both the Republic and Castanor for dominance over Cannor at various points.\n\nBut everything changed when the kobolds attacked, pouring forth in the years of the §YDragonwake§!. In a few short years, the Hierarchy had been reduced to a single island city-state, Nimscodd, with fully half the gnomish population scattered as exiles through Cannor, and many enslaved.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nFor nearly a thousand years the gnomes have maneuvered to regain their lost lands, and are now on the cusp of a grand effort to do so. Having taken the fortress of §YRoyvibobb§! with the help of neighboring §YGawed§!, there is a clear front from which to launch the reclamation. But the kobolds in the north are not the only obstacle to be surmounted.\n\n§YLorent§! and §YGawed§!, the great powers of Cannor, stand in constant watch of each other, both eying land across the border with greed. Courting one or the other would secure the borders, but tempt the other's wrath. And beware the mercurial temperament and lifespan of the humans; Gawed's new, young, monarch already wishes to reclaim the Gnomish Pass for his own ends.\n\nTo the southwest, the settled reavers of §YReveria§! lurk, and deny the hierarchy land access to the city-state of Portnamm, home of the §YCreek Gnomes§!. Directly south of the border sits the Small Country, once colonized by the Hierarchy and now vassals of Gawed and Lorent.\n\nThe Hierarchy stands at the foot of its ancient grandness. With adroit maneuvering and the help of the §YArtificers' Gommo§!, new §Yinventions§! and clever tactics will win the day on the §YDragon Coast§!. Settlers are prepared to recolonize their homeland, and volunteers for the Reclamation Army swell. The kobolds are divided amongst themselves, for now, and the gears are already in motion for the first strike.\n\nThe time of reclamation has come!"

 string_start_gawed:0 "§g"To deny a man your table and hearth is as good as killing him. To steal his little bit of land will end his family. We've never forgotten how to be humane to one another — how to be human. Maybe they have."\n-Welyam III Gerwick, on the news of the end of the Lilac Wars.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nFor a thousand years, there has always been a Gawed - the proud talon in the eye of the powers to its south and east, the threat they could never ignore nor destroy. Formed by the men of the rough, windswept plains, steaming moors, and close, threatening forests of the north, Gawed has waxed and waned over the years but never been truly conquered.\n\nIt has its origins in the §YDragonwake§!, when the city of §YVertesk§! was toppled by §YAlenic§! plainsmen. As the Dragonwake worsened, they moved south through the §YSmall Country§! into the devastated countryside of §YLencenor§!, settling and taking it for their own until driven back north by the unifier-king §YLorenan the Great§!, founder of §YLorent§!, igniting a rivalry that burns to this day.\n\nThe §YCastans'§! rotting empire could not subdue them; despite the §YSorcerer-King Nichmer§! forcing their southern lands under his puppet-state in Vertesk, the moors and hills remained a front of resistance, and when Castanor crumbled, Gawed rose once more. The §YWhite Pestilence§! avoided its cold realms and allowed it to wrest most of the Small Country from a weakened Lorent, setting flame to the smoldering rivalry, before the influence of §YIoriel Redrose§! choked the §YHouse of Gawe§! and sparked the §YDecade of Masks§!, and the civil war that came with it. Since then, Gawed has been ever suspicious of the elves and their vast influence in the southlands.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nWhile most of Cannor has burned in the §YLilac Wars§!, the Kingdom of Gawed was stabilizing following the removal of the last §YBaldfather§! king, §YToman the Mad§!, and has prospered under the new §YHouse of Gerwick§!. Gawed has long been content to expand its influence through quieter means as it rebuilt from misrule, only briefly moving to crush the §YViswall Rebellion§! alongside its longtime rival in Lorent.\n\nThe §YGreentide§! and the end of the Lilac Wars, however, have roused the lords of the north to attention. Were it not for §YCorin§!'s victory in Escann, Gawed might well have been caught sleeping, and the fear of complacency puts dread in every northman's soul.\n\nWith the powers to their east destroyed and those in Anbennar to the south exhausted from the Lilac Wars, they may never have such an opportunity again. Gawed's attention again turns outward; to the city-states along the coast of the §YGiant's Grave§! to the north, to the long-ruined lands of the gnomes and kobolds to their west, and above all, to Anbennar and Lorent in the south. The old empires of men and elves have driven themselves to exhaustion, and thoroughly wasted their day in the sun. It is time for the Eagle of the North to rise!"

 string_start_wex:0 "§g“A new era dawns on Anbennar, free of Silmuna tyranny!” -Emperor Lothane III sil Wex§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nFor as long as they’ve existed, Wexonards have had to fight for every scrap of land and respect they’ve earned. Originating from the north, the Wexonards were driven from their ancestral homeland by the §YGawedi§! during the §YDragonwake§!. What followed was a long and bloody pilgrimage carved across the §YDamerian Republic§!, a bygone precursor to the modern §YEmpire of Anbennar§!.\n\nMultiple times, the Wexonards led the §YThree Tribes§! southward, seeking shelter from the Dragonwake and the Gawedi. Every time, they would be denied. Every time, they would have to take what they needed by force until at last, the Wexonards claimed the ancient Castanorian citadel of §YBal Hyl§!. Here, in the crumbling remnants of the Damerian Republic, they settled. And they’ve spent the ensuing centuries slowly expanding, evolving from a petty kingdom of refugees to the §YGrand Duchy of Wex§!, one of the strongest powers in the Empire of Anbennar.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nSince they began in 1348, Wex has been dragged repeatedly into the §YLilac Wars§!, a series of disputes between the House of Silmuna, long-reigning emperors of Anbennar, and the kingdom of Lorent vying for each other’s thrones. For 80 years, proud Wexonards bled and died for the Silmunas’ personal agenda.\n\nEnough. After three such wars, §YLothane III sil Wex§! made his own bid for the Dove Throne of Anbennar. When the emperor passed, Lothane contested his son, §YAdénn “Skylance” Silmuna§!’s, claim to the throne, and together with the Silmunas’ Lorentish rivals, he ambushed Adénn and his followers at the §YBattle of the Moon Council§!. This act tore the Empire of Anbennar in half, and it would take another two decades of warfare to piece it back together again. But when the dust settled, the Silmunas’ ambitions and excesses had finally been ended and Lothane had earned the Dove Throne.\n\nWex now stands atop the world, but as ever, the Wexonards must continue to fight to earn their place. Many are the foes that would see them dragged from their newfound throne. Wex is threatened on all sides by the hostile §YMoon Party§!, all of whom remain loyal to the fallen House of Silmuna and only bend their knees begrudgingly. Whether they’ll show true fealty to their new emperor or cling to the memory of a dead line is a question Wex will have to answer for them.\n\nThe same question of loyalty is echoed within Wex’s own borders. The freshly claimed lands of §YDameria§! are a rich bounty, but its people will not accept Wex’s dominion quietly. And to the north, the Gawedi, ancient conquerors of the Wexonards’ previous home, are poised to sweep into a weakened empire, bringing the longtime rivals into direct conflict once again. Even Wex’s closest ally, Lorent, prizes them mainly as a muzzle for the empire. Lothane owes his current position to the good graces of Lorent’s young king, §YKylian VI Siloriel§!, but would any emperor be content to play the rulers of Anbennar against each other to benefit a foreign king?"

Astride these two-legged winged beasts, the Vernmen would forge a prosperous land in the south of what would be one day known as §YAnbennar§!, nestled between the §YKhenak Mountains§!, the §YDamesneck Strait§!, and the great §YDivenhal Sea§!. They would rise in fame and renown through their first five centuries, known across Cannor as bold and brave sorts eager for heroics, dramatics, and above all else, adventure. However, the Kingdom would decline as it was "eclipsed by the Moon", the arrival of the §YElves§! and the §YWars of Rule§! forging the §YEmpire of Anbennar§! which reduced Verne to a Duchy. Worse yet, the beloved wyverns of Verne declined and, generations ago, vanished entirely.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nEver loyal, the Vernmen fought for the §YMoon Party§! in the §YLilac Wars§!, quelling the §YLion Armada§! of §YBusilar§! and holding the southern flank for their brothers-in-arms. Alas, it was not enough to save §YDameria§!, and the victorious Rose left her shattered and the empire in the hands of §YWex§!. Yet Verne's greatest glory has been in fighting the §YGreentide§!, vanquished at last. With these wars lost and won, a new chapter in Verne's history begins — §YDuke Armoc IV§! looks to new challenges and horizons for his crowded, ambitious people.\n\nTo the north, the scattered Vernman city-states call for the restoration of what once was, and §YIstralore§! seems to now see a once-friend as a new rival. Across the straits to the west sits a much older rivalry, §YPearlsedge§!, the bald-headed, Reaver-spawn, mariners. To the east Busilar looks avariciously at friendly, island-bound Eborthíl. But between them sit the Hill Gnolls, in the mountains that once were home to wyverns, and across the Divenhal lays Verne's most immediate threat — the slaver-corsairs of §YViakkoc§!, who ravage peaceful settlements and drag off their people for a life in chains!\n\nAnd if adventure beckons from beyond, from the unknown? Well, such a thing is exactly what Vernmen live for!\n\nA new era begins for the land of the Wyvern. Though there may be darkness in the world, it matters little — against the darkness, the light shines ever brighter! To see what lies beyond, to face what is wrong in the world and set it right — these are the duty of the Bold Men of Verne!"

It shrieks across the flatlands and over the gray, stormy sea. The men of Dalr fear the wind for its chill, its ferocity, and its Gerudian storms. The men of Cannor fear the North Wind for a very different reason - it brings the men of Dalr.\n\nThe kingdoms of the north have long been fractious and broken, but their mastery of the sea and hard-bitten tenacity have made them a threat beyond their numbers and size for centuries. In the §YEra of Black Ice§!, they terrorized the Cannorian coast, and even took over the great Empire of §YCastanor§!. Greatest among these is Bjarnrík, the Bear of the North, which has always styled itself as the greatest and most forward-thinking of the kingdoms of Dalr. They have reason to think so. From the very beginning, Bjarnrík has learned much from its southern neighbors, when the warrior-queen §YBera§! founded the country on the model of the southern feudal nations -- and with wealth taken from those southerners. Backed by the §YSkalds§!, the great religious leaders of the north, Bjarnrík rose in power for three centuries, before the people of §YSerpentshead§! landed a stunning reversal on them at Fuglborg, triggering the §YWar of the Bears§! in 1200 as the jarls fought each other for control of the north.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nWhat emerged victorious was Bjarnrík, of course, but her situation is delicate if promising.

As the new Jarl was crowned, §YUrviksten§! began the offensive and although the army of §YNavusgol§! was experienced and well equipped, it was crushed by the imposing discipline of the Black Banners. In the last battle of the §YBlack Pine war§!, Jarl §YKarl II Ebonfrost§! killed the Jarl of Nauvsgol in single combat and exhibited his head on the walls of Urviksten. \n\nBut just as §YUrviksten§! ascended, the §YGraytide§! began.

It was only in 1305 AA that Ramapalar Lotus Claw of Durasidheni succeeded in unifying the Dhenbasana River basin. Ramapalar crowned himself Harimraja and set about rebuilding the old empire - he founded a bureaucracy called the §PRaj Ministries§! to govern his vast holdings and devolved local power to the §YPrahbia§!

The individualistic monks of Xianjie and the indolent eunuchs of Yanszin may decry this style of rule as §Otyrannical§!, but it has allowed the West to weather storms of war which would have toppled lesser realms.

Orcs, united by §YKorgus Dookanson§!, rushed out of the Serpentspine in their millions. Castellyr was first to fall, its white walls worthless against this threat from a new direction. The knights of Adenica were slaughtered with their proud steeds, the Blademarches' legendary sword, §YCalindal, the Gleaming Blade§! was overcome, and the Marrodic were forced into their mountains.\n\nIn the west, as the §YLilac Wars§! raged, many ignored these grim tidings. But following the war's end in 1443, many veterans marched east to confront the threat, earning the moniker "the §YMarcher Lords§!". They were joined by a plethora of adventuring companies, from as far afield as §YLorent§! and §YKheterata§!, as well as the §YCount's League§!, a remnant band of Castellyrian counts led by Carleon Blacktower, and a force of griffon-riders led by Prince Gryf 'the Young'.\n\nThis force dealt the Greentide some of its first defeats, waging a bloody stalemate at the §YBattle of Rottenstep§!. Among the many that fell there was §YCorin§!, a red-headed squire of §YBennon§! — but that night, she arose as an avatar of the fallen god §YAgrados§!. Reborn and renewed, she founded the adventuring party §YCorin's Circle§!, rallied the Marcher Lords, and led them all the way to §YCastonath§! itself. There, while defending §YLothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna§! with her shield, and killing Dookanson with her sword, she was slain for the second time. And this time, she would not rise.\n\nThat was yesterday, the 10th of Nerament. Now, the morning after, the sun rises upon a new Escann, even if it is still infested by orcish and goblin warbands. [Root.GetName] survived the Greentide, and is now the rightful heir to all Escann's greatness. Perhaps one day all Cannor will again be reshaped by the will of an Escanni Emperor."

Stranded within the forest, the elves adapted to their new home, learning to cope with the ways of §Ythe Fey Courts§! and squabbling with the Forest Goblins over territory. Over the centuries, they settled the forest groves and fragmented into distinct and independent salla - Wood Elvish for “clans”. \n\nThe deeply fragmented and decentralized salla were not ready for the Greentide. When it arrived in the Deepwoods, it scattered the elven defenders and saw whole clans destroyed and enslaved, while others were pushed to the edges of their ancestral groves. It seemed as though the Wood Elves would be lost in this calamity - §RThyr Gaethneán, "The Whirlwind."§!\n\nYet against this storm, the remaining heads of the clans held firm, refusing to allow their people to be swept away. Putting aside generations of petty quarrels, these leaders traveled to the city of Elynáile and, in a rare act of unity forged §Ythe Verdant Pact§!, an alliance to coordinate, defend, and reclaim their homes.\n\nNow, for the first time since its arrival, Elvenkind in the Deepwoods is united in one singular purpose.

Then, an immense invasion of orcs tore into the Deepwoods from the north, defeating many of the elven clans and bringing many goblin slaves along with them. Finally, the Verdant Veil fell, once again opening travel out of the Deepwoods. With the elves and orcs at each other’s throats, many of the enslaved goblins escaped and joined our ranks, and with the outside world now open to us, there has never been an opportunity like this for the goblins of the Deepwoods.\n\nStill there is division.

Word quickly spread in the orcish camp that the horde was trapped, and while the chieftains worked together in an effort to escape, their efforts were for naught.\n\nAs their imprisonment became apparent and the cost of the War in the Wood mounted, orcish unity shattered.
