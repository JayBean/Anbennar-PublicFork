 string_start_lorent:0 "§g\"On my honour, I swear eternal love and allegiance to the Rose, the King, and to the Four Virtues of Lady Ioriel."\n-Final verse of the Lorentish Knight's Vow§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nLorent has sat as the rightful sovereign of Western Cannor (known as §YLencenor§!) since long before the arrival of the elves in 1000 AA.\nIt is a country famed for its etiquette, bountiful vineyards and romantic tales of chivalry, but also as one of the §YGreat Powers of Cannor§!, competing with §YGawed§! to the north and the §YEmpire of Anbennar§! to the east for dominion over the continent of §YCannor§!.\n\nThe kingdom owes its inception and name to §YLorenan the Great§!, an ancient human king who famously defeated the invading §YAlenic§! ancestors of its now-rival §YGawed§! during the chaos of the §YDragonwake§! in 470. In much recent history, however, Lorent has become known as a great adopter of elven culture and customs, falling under the guidance of the elf §YIoriel§! in 1022, the wife of then King §YRuben II§!, leading to Lorent becoming the cultural and military superpower it is today.\n\nThe country is divided into two primary cultures: §YHigh Lorentish§! (the half-elven nobility and urban human class who have fully embraced the elven ways) and the §YLow Lorentish§! (the rural backbone of the country who are still predominantly human, though more accepting of the elvenized customs than its other human counterparts elsewhere). In terms of other races, Lorent has long acted as suzerain for the §YRedfoot Halflings§! of the southern §YSmall Country§!, and maintains close relations with its ancient §YRuby Dwarf§! neighbours of §YRubyhold§!. The §YMoon Elf§! realm of the §YRedglades§! also lies under Lorentish control, a woodland sanctuary established by Ioriel herself.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLilac Wars§! (1348-1443) between Lorent and Anbennar has brought the kingdom to its knees. And while Lorent did emerge victorious, destroying the §YHouse of Silmuna§! and preventing them from holding the imperial throne ever again, §YKylian VI§! now finds himself at a fragile peace at home. The war saw Lorent's most powerful vassals, the §YWine Lords§! of §YMadelaire, Eilísin,§! and §YRubenaire§!, side with the Silmuna, and despite the war's end, they have now refused to swear fealty to their rightful overlord, eroding the authority of the Lorentish crown.\n\nTo the east, Lorent has installed its ally, §YLothane, the Grand Duke of Wex§!, on the imperial throne of Anbennar. In the name of unity, Kylian has wed his sister to this new emperor, hoping to use dynastic ties to control the Empire of Anbennar from within, but only time will tell if this is a match meant to last, now that the House of Silmuna, the enemy of their enemy, is no more.\n\nTo the north, the halfling §YSmall Country§! remains calm yet divided between Lorent and its eternal rival, §YGawed§!. Peace never lasts, however, and as Lorent looks to recover from the Lilac Wars, the northern eagle of Gawed begins to look south once again like the days of §YLorenan the Great§!."

 string_start_reveria:0 "§g\"The Lorentish don't fear breaching the Portroy Agreement, but they do fear being breached by our axes!"\n-Famous part of King Lothane III's inauguration speech§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nReveria is a kingdom formed during the §YEra of Black Ice§! (768 - 978 A.A.) by Reavers from Gerudia who raided and ultimately settled these lands. The kingdom itself, along with its ancient dynasty and capital, owes its name to this ancestry.\n\nReveria is famous for its fearsome warriors and distinct culture, which is a unique mix between §YGerudian§! and §YLencori§! traditions and customs. The state has legally secured it's southern border by forcing the §YLorentish§! to sign the §YPortroy Agreement§! in their moment of weakness during the Era of Black Ice, ensuring the land this side of the Portroy river belongs to Reveria. Reveria has both halfling and gnome minorities in its current domain but used to rule over a vaste swathe of originally-gnomish land provinces back when the §YGnomish Pass§! was still under their control.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe northern border is a volatile one. For hundreds of years the Reverians have had tense relations with the kobolds through their previous border in the Gnomish Pass. Although Reveria has ruled over the Gnomish Pass for centuries, it has been wrested from their control by the §YCliff Gnomes§! of §YNimscodd§! in 1396, when they had the support of the §YGawedis§!. Reconquering the Gnomish Pass has been the first item on any agenda ever since.\n\nIf Reveria is to survive the ages, it will have to either carefully maintain the balance between itself and the two giants of §YLorent§! and §YGawed§! or uproot that balance entirely, coming out on top. Who Reveria ends up allying themselves to is perhaps the greatest decision one can make: will they seek allies in the south, where they have supported the §YLorentish§! in the §YLilac Wars§! not a year prior, using a thankful §YLorent§! to cement an alliance? Or will Reveria align itself with §YGawed§!, who they have fought against as recently as 1396 but is the only viable option to defend oneself against §YLorent§!?\n\nReveria is approaching a tumultuous time with no heir to the throne, an old king, a war against the gnomes on the horizon and nothing but their axes to hold §YGawed§! and §YLorent§! at bay."

 string_start_nimscodd_description:0 "§OPrimer§!\nThe gnomish people long called the mountains and hills of the §YDragonheights§! their home. Isolated and safe, for many centuries the gnomes had little dealing with what they saw as barbaric §Yhumans§! and §Yhalflings§! in the muggy plains to the east and south. Over time, many gnomes ventured south towards the coast, forming new urban centers, which became thriving city-states.\n\nBy the 12th century BA these city-states had united to form the §YGnomish Hierarchy§!, one of the ancient empires of antiquity, alongside §YCastanor§! and the §YKingdom of Kheterata§!; between these three great powers Western Cannor was divided up, with the Gnomish Hierarchy subjugating the human and halfing tribes of the §YSmall Country§!, and laying the foundations for §YBeepeck§!.\n\nWith mercantile prowess and technological cunning, the Hierarchy assisted in the colonization of the Dameshead, helping to build both §YVertesk§! and §YDamenath§!. It supported the §YDamerian Republic§! in the §YWar of the Cerulean League§!, though that alliance would be short-lived and the Hierarchy would find itself at war with both the Republic and Castanor for dominance over Cannor at various points.\n\nBut everything changed when the kobolds attacked, pouring forth in the years of the §YDragonwake§!. In a few short years, the Hierarchy had been reduced to a single island city-state, Nimscodd, with fully half the gnomish population scattered as exiles through Cannor, and many enslaved.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nFor nearly a thousand years the gnomes have maneuvered to regain their lost lands, and are now on the cusp of a grand effort to do so. Having taken the fortress of §YRoyvibobb§! with the help of neighboring §YGawed§!, there is a clear front from which to launch the reclamation. But the kobolds in the north are not the only obstacle to be surmounted.\n\n§YLorent§! and §YGawed§!, the great powers of Cannor, stand in constant watch of each other, both eying land across the border with greed. Courting one or the other would secure the borders, but tempt the other's wrath. And beware the mercurial temperament and lifespan of the humans; Gawed's new, young, monarch already wishes to reclaim the Gnomish Pass for his own ends.\n\nTo the southwest, the settled reavers of §YReveria§! lurk, and deny the hierarchy land access to the city-state of Portnamm, home of the §YCreek Gnomes§!. Directly south of the border sits the Small Country, once colonized by the Hierarchy and now vassals of Gawed and Lorent.\n\nThe Hierarchy stands at the foot of its ancient grandness. With adroit maneuvering and the help of the §YArtificers' Gommo§!, new §Yinventions§! and clever tactics will win the day on the §YDragon Coast§!. Settlers are prepared to recolonize their homeland, and volunteers for the Reclamation Army swell. The kobolds are divided amongst themselves, for now, and the gears are already in motion for the first strike.\n\nThe time of reclamation has come!"

 string_start_gawed:0 "§g"To deny a man your table and hearth is as good as killing him. To steal his little bit of land will end his family. We've never forgotten how to be humane to one another — how to be human. Maybe they have."\n-Welyam III Gerwick, on the news of the end of the Lilac Wars.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nFor a thousand years, there has always been a Gawed - the proud talon in the eye of the powers to its south and east, the threat they could never ignore nor destroy. Formed by the men of the rough, windswept plains, steaming moors, and close, threatening forests of the north, Gawed has waxed and waned over the years but never been truly conquered.\n\nIt has its origins in the §YDragonwake§!, when the city of §YVertesk§! was toppled by §YAlenic§! plainsmen. As the Dragonwake worsened, they moved south through the §YSmall Country§! into the devastated countryside of §YLecencor§!, settling and taking it for their own until driven back north by the unifier-king §YLorenan the Great§!, founder of §YLorent§!, igniting a rivalry that burns to this day.\n\nThe §YCastans'§! rotting empire could not subdue them; despite the §YSorcerer-King Nichmer§! forcing their southern lands under his puppet-state in Vertesk, the moors and hills remained a font of resistance, and when Castanor crumbled, Gawed rose once more. The §YWhite Pestilence§! avoided its cold realms and allowed it to wrest most of the Small Country from a weakened Lorent, setting flame to the smoldering rivalry, before the influence of §YIoriel Redrose§! choked the §YHouse of Gawe§! and sparked the §YDecade of Masks§!, and the civil war that came with it. Since then, Gawed has been ever suspicious of the elves and their vast influence in the southlands.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nWhile most of Cannor has burned in the §YLilac Wars§!, the Kingdom of Gawed was stabilizing following the removal of the last §YBaldfather§! king, §YToman the Mad§!, and has prospered under the new §YHouse of Gerwick§!. Gawed has long been content to expand its influence through quieter means as it rebuilt from misrule, only briefly moving to crush the §YViswall Rebellion§! alongside its longtime rival in Lorent.\n\nThe §YGreentide§! and the end of the Lilac Wars, however, have roused the lords of the north to attention. Were it not for §YCorin§!'s victory in Escann, Gawed might well have been caught sleeping, and the fear of complacency puts dread in every northman's soul.\n\nWith the powers to their east destroyed and those in Anbennar to the south exhausted from the Lilac Wars, they may never have such an opportunity again. Gawed's attention again turns outward; to the city-states along the coast of the §YGiant's Grave§! to the north, to the long-ruined lands of the gnomes and kobolds to their west, and above all, to Anbennar and Lorent in the south. The old empires of men and elves have driven themselves to exhaustion, and thoroughly wasted their day in the sun. It is time for the Eagle of the North to rise!"

The whole of Cannor knows you, and cannot help but admire you, for in your heart beats adventure and in your mind the call to do right burns like a torch! The evil quail, and the downtrodden rejoice, when they see the Red Wyvern fly over the field, for there in fine pantaloons and even finer mustaches march the men of Verne, ever striving for something better!\n\nThe Duchy of Verne was born the Kingdom of Verne, founded by the great §YArmoc Vernid§!, first of the §Ywyvern-riders§!. Astride these two-legged winged beasts, the Vernmen would forge a prosperous land in the south of what would be one day known as §YAnbennar§!, nestled between the §YKhenak Mountains§!, the §YDamesneck Strait§!, and the great §YDivenhal Sea§!. They would rise in fame and renown through their first five centuries, known across Cannor as bold and brave sorts eager for heroics, dramatics, and above all else, adventure. However, the Kingdom would decline as it was "eclipsed by the Moon", the arrival of the §YElves§! and the §YWars of Rule§! forging the §YEmpire of Anbennar§! which reduced Verne to a Duchy. Worse yet, the beloved wyverns of Verne declined and, generations ago, vanished entirely.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nEver loyal, the Vernmen fought for the §YMoon Party§! in the §YLilac Wars§!, quelling the §YLion Armada§! of §YBusilar§! and holding the southern flank for their brothers-in-arms. Alas, it was not enough to save §YDameria§!, and the victorious Rose left her shattered and the empire in the hands of §YWex§!. Yet Verne's greatest glory has been in fighting the §YGreentide§!, vanquished at last. With these wars lost and won, a new chapter in Verne's history begins — §YDuke Armoc IV§! looks to new challenges and horizons for his crowded, ambitious people.\n\nTo the north, the scattered Vernman city-states call for the restoration of what once was, and §YIstralore§! seems to now see a once-friend as a new rival. Across the straits to the west sits a much older rivalry, §YPearlsedge§!, the bald-headed, Reaver-spawn, mariners. To the east Busilar looks avariciously at friendly, island-bound Eborthil. But between them sit the Hill Gnolls, in the mountains that once were home to wyverns, and across the Divenhal lays Verne's most immediate threat — the slaver-corsairs of §YViakkoc§!, who ravage peaceful settlements and drag off their people for a life in chains!\n\nAnd if adventure beckons from beyond, from the unknown? Well, such a thing is exactly what Vernmen live for!\n\nA new era begins for the land of the Wyvern. Though there may be darkness in the world, it matters little — against the darkness, the light shines ever brighter! To see what lies beyond, to face what is wrong in the world and set it right — these are the duty of the Bold Men of Verne!"

After §YMunas Moonsinger§!'s bold claims to follow the Moon to a new home for the elves, the first to follow was the ship §YEstádha§!, and its leader, §YIstralara Warsinger§!. Whether this decision was made on a chance, or through sheer belief, the fleet soon arrived in the war-torn land of Cannon amid the §YWar of the Sorcerer-King§!. After the landing, a deal was struck: the elves would find a home in Cannor in exchange for their service against Castanor. And in this, Istralara would be one of their greatest weapons.

During the §YWars of Rule§!, Istralore stood by their Damerian lords and helped elevate the nobility to rule over the Empire rather than the mages. As a reward for their contributions, Istralore was given one of the Electorates to represent the nobles of §YEastern Dameria§!.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThroughout the entirety of the §YLilac Wars§!, Istralore stayed loyal to the Grand Duchy of Dameria.

It shrieks across the flatlands and over the gray, stormy sea. The men of Dalr fear the wind for its chill, its ferocity, and its Gerudian storms. The men of Cannor fear the North Wind for a very different reason - it brings the men of Dalr.\n\nThe kingdoms of the north have long been fractious and broken, but their mastery of the sea and hard-bitten tenacity have made them a threat beyond their numbers and size for centuries. In the §YEra of Black Ice§!, they terrorized the Cannorian coast, and even took over the great Empire of §YCastanor§!. Greatest among these is Bjarnrik, the Bear of the North, which has always styled itself as the greatest and most forward-thinking of the kingdoms of Dalr. They have reason to think so. From the very beginning, Bjarnrik has learned much from its southern neighbors, when the warrior-queen §YBera§! founded the country on the model of the southern feudal nations -- and with wealth taken from those southerners. Backed by the §YSkalds§!, the great religious leaders of the north, Bjarnrik rose in power for three centuries, before the people of §YSerpentshead§! landed a stunning reversal on them at Fuglborg, triggering the §YWar of the Bears§! in 1200 as the jarls fought each other for control of the north.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nWhat emerged victorious was Bjarnrik, of course, but her situation is delicate if promising. The Jarls of §YSidaett§! and §YRevrhavn§! flaunt their liberties in defiance of the crown, with Revrhavn in particular continuing to reave the southlands to the Konungr's increasing ire. To her north, the §YFrost Trolls§! threaten as they have since before there was a Bjarnrik, enslaving captives in their mountain mines. To the east, the fractured Olavish states squabble and skirmish, even as a dangerous new power rises to their east, where the §YGray Orcs§! have crushed the eastern Reach and seem poised to make something entirely new. Across the Frozen Pass to the south sit the city-states of the Giant's Grave: §YBayvic§!, §YAdshaw§!, §YCelmaldor§!, and the hated §YSerpentgard§!. Beyond them lies the vast northern eagle of §YGawed§!, which they cannot but see as a rival and a threat. But beyond all this - beyond the ruins of the Dragon's Coast - lies the remains of the Era of Black Ice. §YReveria§!, §YDeranne§!, §YPearlsedge§! - coastal states far from Dalr, but all of which bear Dalric blood and have their roots in her legacy.\n\nBjarnrik has much to learn from her lost cousins in the south, but in the end she is not the South - she is not defined by what other people do. She is Bjarnrik, the Bear, and the saga of this age is hers to write and sing. The people of Cannor once knew to fear when the seas froze over and the creak of longships could be heard off their coasts. They have forgotten. They will learn again, and soon."

It is centered around the Domandrod, an ancient and forbidden forest populated by the Fey, and around this axle the Eordan build civilizations like spokes on a wheel. The Druidic magic taught to the Eordan after the Day of the Ashen Skies broke the Eordan into five cultures: the Selpheregi who venerate Spring, the Caamas who venerate Summer, the Tuathak who venerate Autumn, the Snecboth who venerate Winter, and the Peitar who strive to maintain balance and heed the orders of their Fey masters. \n\nEordand is soaked in Druidic magical power from the Feyrealm's shadow over the Domandrod. The Eordan primarily dwell around the Domandrod, having left the custody of the Fey long ago, apart from the few chosen Gladewardens. Eordand is surrounded by seas in all directions except for a land connection in the southeast to the desolate Egasach desert, and to the east connected to the Ekyunimoy mountains. Of note are the Sarmadfar Sea alongside the Elarbarc gulf, the Glorelthir coastline, the Randrunnse gulf, and the Broken Sea to the far north studded with icebergs. \n\nThe Domandrod is a vast forest wilderness teeming with wildlife, Fey, and abberations. Within its borders the Feyrealm pokes into the Material Plane, causing fantastical and terrifying landscapes. Surrounding the Domandrod, Eordand is primarily composed of forests and grasslands pierced with rivers, many of which originate from the Domandrod. These surrounding lands may not be half within the Feyrealm, but it's magical influence is still strong, moreso than the effect of the Day of Ashen Skies. \n\nIn the western coast along the Glorelthir and Milsgelp coastline the Spring Court grows in eternal bloom, situated where the season of Spring is the strongest. Along the southern coastline of the Sarmadfar the Summer Court basks in the warmth of the sunn and the cool ocean waves, where the Summer is the strongest. In the far north the Winter Court ekes a living in the half-frozen taiga, where Winter strikes every year the strongest. North of the Spring Court, the Autumn Court's homeland along the Fogarabh wages eternal war and preparation against the Winter. \n\nEordand is dominated by the grand cities of Arakeprun and Murdkather, both being built on the bones of Precursor Ruins. Across Eordand Precursor ruins dot the landscape, some piercing the heavens while others are buried beneath the earth. From these ancient structures countless treasures can be found, some mundane while others containing vast knowledge and power."
