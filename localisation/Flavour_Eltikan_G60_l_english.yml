 G60_distant_brothers_title:0 "Distant Brothers"
 G60_distant_brothers_desc:0 "As we have ventured further into Devand we have made contact with the natives of the region, who similarly fight back against the Kheionai colonisers. In the Mteibas Valley, there lies the Mteibhara, who fought against the Kheionai to protect their sacred valley. As contact increased between our people, we grew to know more about our beliefs and religions. Similarities were soon found out, and many soon considered the Mteibharans as cousins to the Fasíri. Let us invite the leader of the Mteibhar to Rigóti on a pilgrimage, and open his eyes to the truth of our people."
 G60_close_brothers_title:0 "Close Brothers"
 G60_close_brothers_desc:0 "Our friendship with the Mteibhar has continued to grow closer and closer. Our cultures have intermingled greatly; with their state being widely influenced by our religion, they have learned much of our customs without completely abandoning their own. Our shared brotherhood, born from a similar origin of oppression, shall unite our kingdoms into something completely new."
 G60_riding_on_reach_title:0 "Riding On The Reach"
 G60_riding_on_reach_desc:0 "As we move further east in the Andic Reach, we have discovered more Nekheis in unknown lands and near civilizations we have never seen before. These remaining Kheionai must be absorbed into the kingdom, as we show them our true faith and promise of true unity. Once the coast is completely under our control, we can direct our gaze to the north, from where we’ve had messengers inform us of nomadic people who are said to ride cats as mounts."
 G60_crouching_leopoard_hidden_boar_title:0 "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Boar"
 G60_crouching_leopoard_hidden_boar_desc:0 "As we’ve travelled further north past Devand, we have discovered the land of The Chendhya. The strange landscape is devoid of trees and has many large animals prowling the fields, but our biggest interest is in the nomadic people that claim these parts. The mounts they ride are astoundingly intriguing to us, seemingly polar opposites to the boars we ride: Fast, sleek and ferocious, but easy to damage. Although we would like to learn more about the mounts, the Chendhyans themselves have a passion for aggression, attacking us on sight. We will show them our ways and faith, taming their anger and uniting them under our kingdom."
 G60_the_opposition_title:0 "Settling Peace"
 G60_the_opposition_desc:0 "In our conquests of the Chendhya we have found that the natives have tamed the large cats and used them as formidable battle mounts against all who trespass into their territory. After our arduous efforts of subjugating the wild steppes, effort must now be put into giving the Chendhyans confidence in us. Valuing freedom above all else, taking them for granted will surely make them view us in a bad light. By providing them with what they want, we can finally make peace.\n\nHopefully, we can take a look at those mounts after all this has blown over."
 G60_southern_campaign_title:0 "Southern Campaign"
 G60_southern_campaign_desc:0 "The cities to the south maintain relative peace and focus on their craft rather than wars of expansion, yet they still hold long standing grudges that prevent the development of the region. Even in their prosperity they dare to squabble with each other, rejecting progress while focusing on their endeavours across the sea. Their complacency will not be tolerated as we journey to conquer their cities, uniting them under the banner of the boar!"
 G60_island_hopping_title:0 "Island Hopping"
 G60_island_hopping_desc:0 "While the main settlements on Alecand have been taken over, the Kheionai have also settled the islands of the Cleaved Sea and the eastern lands they called The Devand. In order to eliminate any threat to our new unification, we must capture the islands, which will give easier access to reach the Kheoinai Nekheis."
 G60_new_kheions_title:0 "New Kheions"
 G60_new_kheions_desc:0 "Our unification efforts on Alecand still continue, but many of the Kheionai still live in the Nekheis on the mainland of Devand, where they have repelled the natives just as they tried to repel us. In order to prevent these colonies from committing the same mistakes as the city states on Alecand, we must bring their rule to an end while gaining a foothold on the unexplored lands - with this we can potentially find new allies and bring the rest of the Kheionai people into our fold."
 G60_providing_settlements_title:0 "Providing Settlements"
 G60_providing_settlements_desc:0 "As the Devand is a wild and unexplored land, it is best to gain a proper foothold on the region by mapping out the region for housing and attracting displaced Kheionai with the promise of a new home on the frontiers. Once we are able to achieve this, the settlement of the best sections of the land will be much easier, as we can exploit the lands with the most crucial resources and improve the Nekheis to become as great as the Kheions on Alecand."
 G60_religious_strife_title:0 "Religious Strife"
 G60_religious_strife_desc:0 "The long standing atheistic traditions of the Kheionai have been stubbornly closing off their hearts from accepting our faith from across the mountains. With our clergy joining together, we can push conversion efforts across all the cities, proclaiming Gotiriei as the true faith of the known world, one undivided and true to its beginning."
 G60_a_truly_strong_king_title:0 "A Truly Strong King"
 G60_a_truly_strong_king_desc:0 "With our kingdom expanding to every known reach of the world, we can be proud of the rulers that have brought us this far. United by our religion and the holy Rigoti, we can claim our King to be the One True Riei, one with insurmountable strength and knowledge who is truly deserving of the Last True King’s blessing."
 G60_a_powerful_country_title:0 "A Powerful Country"
 G60_a_powerful_country_desc:0 "In Lokemeion lie the staunchest supporters of Kheionism and their belief of republicanism being the logistically supreme form of governance, one that had never failed them in the past. Yet as our kings have proved time and time again, with their grand campaigns of conquest and state building, that they are chosen by our god himself their efforts are not self-made. Through countless decades in our new kingdom the Riei has ushered in prosperity and brought many peoples under one governance with no failure. The belief of the Kheionai that a bloodline of kings cannot achieve that of elected rulers must be proven false to them directly, revealing their previous conceptualizations on religion and the state to be flawed."
 G60_alecand_conquest_title:0 "Ride Of The Boars"
 G60_alecand_conquest_desc:0 "Long have we Fasíri stayed to the west of Alecand, naturally protected from the death winds by the Highlands to the north and the Rigoti. To the east, the haughty Kheionai rule from their great wind-warded cities, disunited like we once were. They view us to be mere simple barbarians but as they have witnessed our newfound unity, they begin to mobilise at our borders in preparation to subjugate us. We must rally the tribes and fly the banners of the boar, as we march east to show them we will not back down from ruling our own sovereign state."
 G60_return_metei_title:0 "Return To Rigóti"
 G60_return_metei_desc:0 "After many battles fought, cities conquered, and good men laid to rest, the Kheionai have finally been pushed to subservience. As Fasíri soldiers begin making the treacherous journey back to the capital, the word of peace spreads throughout the homelands: we have won.\n\nNow, what is left to do?\n\nA thought comes into the mind of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] … ‘We must journey to Rigoti once more, and climb to its peak.’\n\n’There is someone who we must thank.’"
 G60_aftermath_title:0 "The Aftermath"
 G60_aftermath_desc:0 "The Kheionai have a long-ingrained culture and heritage, with their strong ties to republicanism and their elected leaders, as well as their belief in city-states as the basis of all civilisation. It came to them as quite a shock that our king had subjugated their former states, leading to a different order and tradition replacing theirs. While stubborn, we know they are not averse to reason as we begin integration efforts between our cultures and show to them we are worthy of ruling Alecand and all of the peoples within it."
 G60_first_steps_title:0 "The First Steps"
 G60_first_steps_desc:0 "The Kheionai reaction to our conquests has been overwhelmingly negative, as they clung on to their old values of the city-state being the basis of all civilisation. They are baffled that we so-called barbarians dare to rule over their lands and they refuse to cooperate to come to a mutual agreement where they can live peacefully under our rule. Their hate must be met with diplomacy and compromise if we are to prevent a large-scale revolt on the entire eastern side of Alecand."
 G60_understanding_kheionai_title:0 "Understanding the Kheionai"
 G60_understanding_kheionai_desc:0 "As we have spent more time living alongside the Kheionai, we have begun to find the gripes against our leadership over them. In order to gain a better understanding with them, we should do our best to cultivate friendly contacts, who can give us information on how best to integrate the rebellious people."
 G60_shared_festival_title:0 "A Shared Festival"
 G60_shared_festival_desc:0 "As we have hired Kheionai advisors to serve our court, we have gained much insight into the minds of an average citizen. By hosting a festival across the kheions, we can show the people that we are not here to bring war or violence, but to bloom prosperity for every single person under the banner of  Òstin Fas."
 G60_getting_our_boars_wet_title:0 "Getting Our Boars Wet"
 G60_getting_our_boars_wet_desc:0 "The Cleaved Sea is a great boon which connects both sides of our kingdom, providing us with a great way to traverse between it and helping us transport resources to every city that requests them. As we expand our navy, we can hope to appease the cities of Ormam and Oktikheion which have an immemorial and great naval tradition that was suppressed in our conquests. As we need sailors to man the great trade vessels and warships, we will be happy to expand their cities and bring our people together as the wind propels us to new heights."
 G60_might_makes_right_title:0 "Might Makes Right"
 G60_might_makes_right_desc:0 "As we have proved our Riei to be paramount in might and wisdom across the great cities of Alecand and the expanse of Devand, it has come to the last city of Degakheion to know our rule as legitimate. We will prepare a grand military parade across the city, showing how much our kingdom has expanded with all the various cultures celebrating our prosperity and strength. Surely the Degabhen can see reason and finally view us as worthy to rule over them…"
 G60_northern_campaign_title:0 "Northern Campaign"
 G60_northern_campaign_desc:0 "The northern cities of the Kheionai have recently fought a great war, resulting in the annexation of Kimanis by both of its neighbours. Their petty wars led to thousands of deaths for a mere expansion of influence on Alecand, with no regard to the wellbeing of their people. It is clear they know nothing of real unity and as they dare to bring our own under their fold, their lands will be seized and their rulers deposed - for it is the Fasíri that will bring true rule all of Alecand!"
 G60_upon_empty_lands_title:0 "Upon Empty Lands"
 G60_upon_empty_lands_desc:0 "With the threats to Alecand secured, we can focus on the expansion of our untamed ancestral Fasíri lands to ensure our lands prosper and cities expand. So much wealth lies beneath the hills and highlands, ripe for the extraction and to be put to use to further our goals. A strong heartland will ensure our people grow and prosper, allowing us to pursue a new age of unity not seen before in all of our lands."
 G60_neglected_treasure_title:0 "Neglected Treasure"
 G60_neglected_treasure_desc:0 "As it is mostly the cities that are settled by the Kheionai, much of the other lands are left neglected due to the difficulty of protecting them from the death winds. With our conquests, we should move our people eastwards to settle the unused lands, bringing our goods and kindness to the once oppressed Kimabhen people. Once they see our hospitality and much better treatment of them, they will surely not join revolts against us, and through continued loyalty they may gain representation within the new kingdom."
 G60_kheionai_land_rights_title:0 "Kheionai Lands Rights"
 G60_kheionai_land_rights_desc:0 "Giving the Kheionai land rights will help to solidify our rule in the cities and help us gain recognition of our rule among the nobility. Doing so will give us powerful allies who in turn will align with our rule, allowing us to further begin the integration of each culture to finally achieve unity in Alecand."
 G60_sharing_forges_title:0 "Sharing Our Forges"
 G60_sharing_forges_desc:0 "Our great lands are rich in all kinds of metal, and as our conquests grow so does the need for more arms. The great city of Kherka was the heart of all metallurgy in Alecand, but as the Kheionai refused to aid us, their forges lay dormant. With a large influx of precious metals at their doorstep, we will revive the passion for the old craft of the city, letting them fulfil metalworking needs for our whole kingdom and all of the riches that lie below it."
 G60_bracing_storm_title:0 "Bracing The Storm"
 G60_bracing_storm_desc:0 "The Kaydhano Sea to the northeast has long plagued our lands with the death winds but the city of Arpedifer bears the most intense destruction. Constructing larger defences to improve the warding effects is crucial to alleviate the lives of everyone in the surrounding area. As we expand our navy, we carry a greater amount of resources to the barren region, supplying it with rations, stone and magical materials for warding. The grand castle which highlights the might of our unity against the supernatural devastation of the Kaydhano will only show the Kheionai that we are worthy to rule all of Alecand."
 G60_new_magics_title:0 "New Magics"
 G60_new_magics_desc:0 "Fasíri shamans are different from most. What most people consider magic is what we have come to understand as the remnants of the blood and spirit of the Kings Of All Heavens. Thus, out of respect for the lost lords of the world, we avoided using magic in politics, instead showing our prowess through our own merits. While this has allowed our small population great prosperity through spells of growth and protection, our recent conquests have proven to us that shamans are a powerful tool to have in your court. With the recent pilgrimage to Rigoti, we have also received the blessing of our true lord to use the essence of the dead lords for our benefits.\n\nNow is the time to begin the integration of spells and ‘magic’ into the management of our kingdom."
 G60_a_court_of_magic_title:0 "A Court Of Magic"
 G60_a_court_of_magic_desc:0 "Now that we have unleashed the shaman's power in the management of our country, the next step ís to provide them with the necessary tools to strengthen the power of magic in Òstin Fas.This may come into conflict with important figures in our country, but it is a worthwhile risk for continuing our magical progression."
 G60_magic_forges_title:0 "Magic Forges"
 G60_magic_forges_desc:0 "Kherka is an impressive city of metalworks and forges, producing sets of armour and quality blades that match the bronzeworks of the Fasíri. Entering these forges, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] is astounded to see hundreds of skilled craftsmen working on some of the finest steel swords he has seen. Looking to his left, hundreds more are working on helmets and shields, but something more catches his eye…\n\nA blue rock shining with a hue he recognizes, a shard of the body of one of the dead gods!\n\nInquiring more about this stone has lead to [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] discovering more about how the Kheionai use the blue fragments, and hearing of their practical uses in combat and study for mages.\n\n’Have you ever studied how to use these fragments in your smithing?’\n\n’What?’\n\n’Let’s work on that.’"
 G60_a_new_peoples_title:0 "New Peoples"
 G60_a_new_peoples_desc:0 "With Ameion existing as our furthest outpost in the east, we had only seen a fraction of another civilisation to the northeast, who call themselves the Taychendi. While we had no true diplomatic relations with them, we should prepare some emissaries to greet the denizens of the region, allowing us to survey the current state of their civilization and their cultural and religious differences which we may have to overcome."
 G60_taychend_todo_title:0 "Taychend TODO"
 G60_taychend_todo_desc:0 "Waiting on the Taychend Rework.\n\nThank you so much for playing my MT!\n\n-Spyhaus.\n\nP.S, Sorry for breaking your immersion."
 G60_right_breaks_the_night_title:0 "Right Breaks The Night"
 G60_right_breaks_the_night_desc:0 "The cowards who dared to plot against us in the shadows have lost their greatest soldiers in a pointless rebellion against the one true Riei. However, not all in the city have forsaken the pursuit of unity as only the malicious have been rooted out from the cracks of Degabhen society. As the last city finally recognises our rule, we can proclaim the blessed rule of the Riei across all corners of the known world. Unity is just a stone's throw away!"
 G60_above_the_desert_title:0 "Above The Desert"
 G60_above_the_desert_desc:0 "The land to the north of the Kaydhano Sea has not been explored much, with our focus being in the east. Our people call it Tinilurti, or New Land. It is a land of great geographical diversity, from the southern deserts to the northern jungles which is ripe for expansion of our unified Kingdom! With so much land overflowing with resources and a mostly friendly native population, it is a great opportunity to settle down away from the dangerous Death Winds."
 G60_amadian_control_title:0 "Amadian Control"
 G60_amadian_control_desc:0 "On the shores of Lake Chakantu lies the great city of Cara Lafquen, a settlement of great importance for the region with the greatest population. Their rich land is almost of no interest to them, and we may have potentially found relics of great quality throughout the outskirts of the city! We must convert this city into a base of operations so we may extract the relics and begin our studies while also focusing on finding more across Tinilurti."
 G60_avoiding_the_kaydhando_title:0 "Avoiding The Kaydhando"
 G60_avoiding_the_kaydhando_desc:0 "The land of Tinilurti is finally fully under our control, with all the fertile lands put to use we can improve the lives of every one of our citizens across the vast kingdom. As the land is not beset by the horrific death winds of the Kaydhano, we can focus on resource collection and bringing prosperity to the great new cities founded by our unified people!"
 G60_gathering_materials_title:0 "Gathering Materials"
 G60_gathering_materials_desc:0 "To make sure that we are able to sustainably provide the shamans with their weaponry, we need to make sure that we have the supplies to do so from the get-go. We need mines of iron and copper, and we need to make sure that our major forges are capable of handling this work without problems. Tiberána and Kherka will become centres of Jainkatia production, making sure that our shamans can stay in the fight."
 G60_studying_the_alloy_title:0 "Studying The Alloy"
 G60_studying_the_alloy_desc:0 "When we discovered the alloy, smiths across Òstin Fas began searching for a practical use for its unique properties. Some have stated that its magical sturdiness allows it to have great strengths in building and for tools, while others claim that it is too brittle to be of any use outside of jewellery. Nobody can confirm whether these claims are true or not because the research is disorganised. With the scarcity of the fragments, continuing in such a manner will lead to unnecessary waste of a rare resource.\n\nIf we are to make use of our new invention, then regulating our studies through leadership and camaraderie will yield better results."
 G60_proof_of_concept_title:0 "Proof Of Concept"
 G60_proof_of_concept_desc:0 "After it was determined that Jainkatia was best suited for weaponry, many generals across Alecand began researching how to implement it into their armies. Enchanted weapons made of Jainkatia would be easy to fit into our armies, as making a hammer and having our smiths and shamans work together to make it stronger has been proven possible thanks to our testing of the alloy.\n\nWhat is harder is to justify the inclusion of shamans in our armies. Fasíri armies have never properly included them outside of special cases, as casting spells on boarback was difficult and tedious, especially considering that the Fasíri weapon of choice was the heavy-weight hammer. The rewards of allowing shamans to be included in our armies could be shocking though, as Jainkatia has been shown to allow for easy conduction of spells, even with the heaviest of weapons. We must take the time to understand if it's even possible to include them amongst our ranks."
 G60_mages_in_the_army_title:0 "Mages In The Army"
 G60_mages_in_the_army_desc:0 "With Jainkatia hammers being put to use in our armies, and shamans working amongst the ranks of our regular soldiers, there have been problems with organisation and proper implementation of these new tools. This has led to an inefficient battalion stuck in limbo, and that serves us no use. Restructuring an army to allow for cohesion is no small task, especially for one so large as ours, but it must be done."
 G60_sheltering_sky_title:0 "THE SHELTERING SKY"
 G60_sheltering_sky_desc:0 "[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] sits a mile below the peak of Rigoti, sitting upon a cliff with a perfect view of the Eastern Alecand. Many hard years of labour have gone by to make the Berribhen peoples brethren of ours. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] looks at the work of his ancestors in building the empire of peace and prosperity that the Fasíri people were destined for. Walking around Rigoti with his escorts, making sure not to go any higher than they were already, they circle around to view the ancestral homes of all Fasíri peoples, and how far they have come. Upon that view, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]’s home city of Tiberána can be seen from a distance, glimmering with activity. \n\n[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] calls his shamans and advisors to him, and says…\n\n’Bring me the finest smiths in all of Alecand. I will wait here. There is something that needs to be done, to mark a new age.’"
