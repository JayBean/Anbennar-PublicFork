 A99_dwarves_under_our_rule_desc:0 "Having conquered Anvilwright and Silverforge Hall, we must now decide how we will treat the dwarves in our lands: Will we try to integrate them into Varainé society as a top-down effort, or allow them to retain their autonomy and wait for integration to come on its own?"

 A99_dwarves_and_orcs_desc:0 "The slavery and extermination of orcs in Escann - and their subsequent flight from persecution towards more tolerant places - presents Varainé with an interesting, but difficult decision.\n\nOn one hand, we could accept these orcs with open arms, though this would be hard to swallow for the majority of our population and for the Dwarves under our rule. On the other hand, we could allow the orcs in our nation as laborers under the dwarves, risking alienating their race even further, but still giving them better living conditions than as Escanni slaves."
 A99_pluralism_title:0 "Pluralism"
 A99_pluralism_desc:0 "With the recent expansion of Varainé, our nation has become home to various different cultures and races.

 A99_multiracial_diplomacy_title:0 "Multiracial Diplomacy"
 A99_multiracial_diplomacy_desc:0 "The racial minorities of Varainé are growing steadily, both in terms of rights and population. Some have even reached higher positions in government.

 A99_present_threats_title:0 "Present Threats"
 A99_present_threats_desc:0 "Varainé's current independence is a fickle matter, as many of our neighbors are larger, more powerful, and upset at the outcome of the Lilac Wars. Foremost of these neighbors are Leslinpár, of whom Varainé used to be a domain, and Silverforge, who control the nascents of the Logrodainé. To secure our continued existence as a sovereign nation, we must present a strong face to any would be enemies, especially the dwarves and our former overlords."
 A99_secure_our_borders_title:0 "Secure our Borders"
 A99_secure_our_borders_desc:0 "While our allies and our newfound army may help deter immediate attacks, to ensure Varainé's independence into the future we must start looking outwards.

 A99_past_threats_title:0 "Past Threats"
 A99_past_threats_desc:0 "Though we have conquered or cut down in size our most immediate threats, many other dangers still stand between Varainé and its continued independence.

 A99_charcoal_and_powder_title:0 "Charcoal and Powder"
 A99_charcoal_and_powder_desc:0 "While gunpowder has been known and employed by dwarves since before the fall of Aul-Dwarov, only now is gunpowder becoming prevalent in Cannorian warfare. Varainé, having extensive access to sulfur from the Green River and charcoal from its forests, as well as being closely tied to the dwarves who once employed this technology, is in an extremely privileged spot for the production of this substance. We should take advantage of these circumstances, and develop ourselves into the foremost producers of gunpowder in our region"

 A99_elven_communities_title:0 "Elven Communities"
 A99_elven_communities_desc:0 "Ever since the end of the war of the Sorcerer-King, when Varainé was first founded as a holding of the Párian nobility, the county has become home to a sizable population of Moon Elves.

 A99_increasing_concentration_title:0 "Increasing Concentration"
 A99_increasing_concentration_desc:0 "As the productivity of our lands around the Green River soars, it becomes ever more important for us that the Green River remains a viable source of sulfur and other chemical compounds that we have come to rely on.

 A99_chemical_synthesis_title:0 "Chemical Synthesis"
 A99_chemical_synthesis_desc:0 "As Varainéy technology gets more advanced, we discover more and more usages for our chemicals.

 A99_the_green_river_mission_desc:0 "Our namesake and greatest pride, the Green River, is the heart of Varainé, and beyond being a stunning natural sight, it is also the starting point of our legacy of potionmaking and alchemy.

 A99_government_support_desc:0 "As potions and alchemy become more and more important for Varainé, and as the former humble gatherings near the Green river become ever larger and increasingly important, it has become both necessary and extremely interesting for the Varainéy government to provide proper infrastructure for potion-makers and alchemists, allowing them to produce their goods and spread their knowledge much more efficiently and in a much wider scale."

To avoid any unnecessary bloodshed, we may be able to strike a deal with the current owner of these lands and acquire it through more peaceful means. On the other hand, we could also not bother with this expense and conquer the province in our own terms."

 flavor_varaine.3.d:0 "With the provinces of Silverforge Hall and Anvilwright under our possession, we now have a sizable dwarven population in our lands, the likes of who could greatly improve our nation if we were to properly integrate them.

 flavor_varaine.5.d:0 "Orcs fleeing from the Escanni slave trade have made their way to Varainé, looking for a place to settle. While we believe that integrating these orcs into our society could lead to great things for everyone involved, doing so would be a hard sell for some of our population and neighbors who were deeply affected by the Greentide. On the other hand, our dwarven Communities seem to have their own ideas as to what we should do with the orcs; let them into Varainé under the condition they agree to work for the dwarven cartels. While this would be better than the slavery they were subjected too, it still wouldn't be particularly accepting of their people."

Currently, two main lines of thought permeate our military leaders as to how this implementation might be done; either as a concentrated boon to our most important knights and military units - with the caveat of large parts of our army being left behind - or as more widespread tool to be used by the entire army, at the cost of having to divert some of our other production to supplying the needed potions for the army."

 flavor_varaine.10.d:0 "For centuries, alchemy and potion-making have been present in Varainé, in larger or smaller scales, due mostly to the presence of the Green River. However, as the 16th century came about, Varainé improved upon these crafts, turning them from mere curiosities into proper tools for the nation and its people, and now, alchemy is almost ever present in Varainéy life; Potions of various kinds are used extensively by commoners and nobles, chemical compounds boost all aspects of our economy, and commerce of ingredients and finished products have turned the once bucolic town of Varainé into a bustling city.\n\n While this meteoric growth of alchemy - and by consequence Varainé - cannot be assigned to a single factor, it is undeniable that the Varainéy government's support of the alchemists was instrumental for the nation to reach the heights it did. And now, as demand for potions soars and opportunities to develop new potions start revealing themselves, the need for an institution to foster the research of alchemy and properly train the future generations of alchemists becomes clear.\n\nTo this end, the Varainéy government built the Academy of Alchemy, Potioncraft, and Herbalism: the foremost research and training institution of the alchemical sciences in all of Halann. This institution, as well as representing the overwhelming importance of these sciences in Varainéy society, also open the doors to even more advanced and large scale usage of potions, as following its construction the alchemists started organizing themselves as a political entity, going from disparate producers into a largely organized political group, thus opening the doors to many wide scale projects which were previously impossible."

 flavor_varaine.11.d:0 "The Green River is the pride of Varainé, however ever since its large-scale utility was discovered in the 15th century, the river has progressively been molded into a tool for the state and the alchemicals industry. These changes suffered by the river, though gradual, were noticed by many in our nation, who disliked the fact that the river over the years had become more and more polluted and dense with chemicals to the point where it's nearly impossible to properly appreciate the river's natural beauty.\n\n These reports, which grow more and more numerous by the year, are a large concern for the Varainéy government, and efforts to conserve or even restore the river started being looked into. However, alchemists brought forward new proposals to increase the river's utility even further, a decision which would greatly alienate even more of the people who desire the river to be preserved, but would bring large economic boons to the nation."

With so much research to be done and so many novice alchemists to train, it is only natural that an expansion to the academy be built. With this expansion, we find the opportunity to create new research branches, most notably into fields which despite adjacent to the institution's main alchemical focus, would still greatly benefit the nation and the alchemy industry."

However, despite their friendliness and desire to help, there was only so much our alchemists were able to learn about dragons and their inner functioning before beginning to strain the limits of the kobold's generosity, until finally they reached some knowledge the kobolds were unwilling to share.\n\nTo get the information needed to finish our research, we could try to make a deal with the Kobolds, increasing our access to their stored knowledge.

Alternatively we could increase the price of the potions in general, both restricting the access in a less discriminatory manner and giving the government a nice increase in revenue.

 alchemical_exploration_corps_reform_desc:0 "By formally institutionalizing the Alchemical Exploration Corps as the de facto diplomatic branch of the nation's government, it is possible to fully utilize the connections and pathways forged by these explorers to solidify the country's diplomatic outreach. This will also allow for the government to have greatly increased access to alchemical and artificery resources from these diplomatic connections. However, the Alchemists who now control a great deal of the nation's power will be able to exert more power over the government itself, acting as a collective ruling body under the king, and pushing for a more decentralized country, thus taking some power away from the monarch"
