 #Startup event
 verne.100.t:0 "Land of prowess, home of adventurers"
 verne.100.d:0 "In a bustling barrack in Arca Lar, a new recruit peers into the regiment commanders’ tent. Inside, three commanders – each sporting a completely bespoke uniform of gaudy reds, golds, purples, and greens – argue at the top of their lungs in peculiarly provincial accents. They refuse to listen to one another, shouting that their own extensive experience means they obviously know better than all the others.\nThe recruit scurries along before he’s spotted, and soon heads to a group of seasoned soldiers. Worried by the argument, and the boorish behaviour of his new commanders, he asks the soldiers: “Brothers, why are our commanders... um... these people?”\n\nIn response, several voices pipe up excitedly:\n“Have you seen Darkheart’s helmet? I’m told he slew a demon and now wears its horns!”\n“Ha! Gnollsbane routed two bands of gnolls by herself, she even made a necklace out of their fangs!”\n“Well, Fisherman is said to have stolen a ship from the Pearlsedge lobsters!”\nA burst of laughter comes over the crowd before settling down.\n\nImpressed by the achievements, the recruit is reassured. They then ask, with a gleam in their eyes: “What about us? Do you think we will ever become commanders?”\n\nThe answer to this question is ingrained in any Vernman. Several soldiers reply in unison: “Glory is for those who act first, so charge forth and show you are no mere soldier. Earn proof of great deeds and rise above the rest! Then, you shall be a proud Vernman !”\nAnd a great reckless smile carves itself across the soldier’s eyes as they all flash trinkets and baubles, each gathered from enemies they defeated.\n\nSuch is the way of the Vernman, vainglorious adventurers fighting under the Wyvern banner. For their glory and fame! Those distinguished by their deeds are elevated, and those that do nothing, forgotten."
