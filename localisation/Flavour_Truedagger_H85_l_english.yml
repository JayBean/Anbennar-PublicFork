 H85_new_opportunities_title:0 "New Opportunities"
 H85_new_opportunities_desc:0 "Amldihr: the Gates of the Assembly. Once the shining capital of the dwarves, now a shattered stronghold filled with orcs. The keep represents something different to every creature that calls the Serpentspine its own; power, control, safety, prestige... or, to us, a new opportunity for greatness!"
 H85_conquer_the_ogres_title:0 "Conquer the Ogres"
 H85_conquer_the_ogres_desc:0 "Though the ogres of the Serpent's Vale were said to be unmatched in their raw might, we had numbers on our side! The tales of a hundred goblins scratching, clawing, and climbing over a combatant bigger than the mountains of the Serpentspine will make our enemies think twice!"
 H85_the_serpents_vale_title:0 "The Serpent's Vale"
 H85_the_serpents_vale_desc:0 "The orcs that came before us decimated the Vale's irrigation system. Begrudgingly, we can admit that the mechanics involved are beyond anything we've worked with, but we goblins are just as smart as the dwarves, and there's just enough of their creation left behind for us to figure out which bit goes where..."
 H85_greenskin_fights_title:0 "Greenskin Fights"
 H85_greenskin_fights_desc:0 "Two goblins fighting is hardly a spectacle. There's an awful lot of clawing and spitting, a bit of biting, and occasionally a rock swung here or there. Our people, however, are quite taken by battles between our brawny orc cousins and our beastly ogre subjects. They certainly make for a far more entertaining sport!"
 H85_improve_the_arena_title:0 "Improve the Arena"
 H85_improve_the_arena_desc:0 "The Greenskin Arena has proven incredibly popular, both amongst the crowds and prospective contenders. Expanding the arena would likely turn out to be a profitable, worthwhile endeavour."
 H85_the_intrigue_court_title:0 "The Intrigue Court"
 H85_the_intrigue_court_desc:0 "Since we first laid claim to our section of the Serpentspine, the best and brightest among us have debated how we ought to govern our clan. Although support for our Clanboss has always been high, successors have consistently struggled to prove their legitimacy, and neither a republic nor a monarchy has proven popular amongst the people.\n\nLuckily, it appears our Clanboss has an idea for something a little… sneakier…"
 H85_legitimize_our_claims_title:0 "Legitimize our Claims"
 H85_legitimize_our_claims_desc:0 "We lay claim to a large part of the West Serpentspine, but the veracity of these claims continues to be questioned by other nations and, to a degree, our own people. First, we will prove them wrong; second, we will finally reclaim our rightful lands!"
 H85_to_the_north_title:0 "To the North"
 H85_to_the_north_desc:0 "Orlazam-az-Dihr: the Gate of the Ramlords. Known not only for their namesake cavalry but also their food production that once fed much of the dwarovar. This hold to our north thus presents itself as a perfect next target to fuel our future expansion."
 H85_the_grand_observatory_title:0 "The Grand Observatory"
 H85_the_grand_observatory_desc:0 "Dûr-Vazhatun: the Astronomer Hold. The ancestral home of the Sapphire Dwarves, marred by the fading remnants of some great tragedy. Where the VSapphire looked up and found chaos, might we look forwards to find prosperity?"
 H85_the_northern_serpentspine_title:0 "The Northern Serpentspine"
 H85_the_northern_serpentspine_desc:0 "After many years of conquest and colonisation, we have finally taken control of the entirety of the Northern Serpentspine! Finally, Truedagger is known as more than a simple goblin clan - we are a mighty nation in our own right!"
 H85_all_hail_the_clanboss_title:0 "All Hail the Clanboss !"
 H85_all_hail_the_clanboss_desc:0 "We have followed our Clanboss at every turn, and our loyalty to the cause has finally paid off! Under their leadership, we have achieved things previously unthinkable! We will follow them until these very mountains crumble around us! Long may they reign!"
 H85_find_their_homes_title:0 "Find Their Homes"
 H85_find_their_homes_desc:0 "Rebellions in our disloyal subjects are all too common, as they fail to respect the Clanboss' rule. Luckily, our new mages have the ability to scry for anything we'd need to put an end to these uprisings.\n\nLet's see how long a rebel riots when we respond with a visit to their home address..."
 H85_eternal_loyalty_title:0 "Eternal Service"
 H85_eternal_loyalty_desc:0 "Since we organised our nation, powerful landholders have always been hard to control. The courtiers' partial control of the Shadow Daggers, in particular, is putting us in a difficult position. We must curtail their influence and ensure their loyalty, to re-establish complete control over our elite spies and assassins."
 H85_seizing_amldihr_title:0 "Seizing Amldihr"
 H85_seizing_amldihr_desc:0 "The Gates of the Assembly are ours - or, at least, what's left of them. In the war, the already-damaged hold was broken down even further. With a bit of goblin ingenuity (and a lot of hard work), let us rebuild Amldihr to be even greater than it was before!"
 H85_the_kronium_hold_title:0 "The Kronium Hold"
 H85_the_kronium_hold_desc:0 "The work to restore Amldihr is finally over, and there is no more glorious sight than its storied halls teeming with Truedagger goblins!"
 H85_a_blue_roof_title:0 "A Blue Roof ?"
 H85_a_blue_roof_desc:0 "An odd rumour is spreading amongst our people: a giant cavern with an immense blue roof has been found outside our new hold. Our scouting expeditions have now confirmed that this incredible cavern really exists! It looks to be rich with resources and marvels, and we must colonise towards it!"
 H85_the_goblin_village_title:0 "The Goblin Village"
 H85_the_goblin_village_desc:0 " In the capital of the conquered ogres of the Serpent's Vale, we found something peculiar: a village of goblins, living in coexistence with the giantkin. While their relationship with the Mire Maw clan was mostly benign, they were still forced to adapt to living outside of the safety of the Serpentspine.\n\nMany of them resorted to the cloak-and-dagger - some could even best our most skilled assassins! We will integrate them and their ideas into our own clan."
 H85_the_shadow_daggers_title:0 "The Shadow Daggers"
 H85_the_shadow_daggers_desc:0 "As we have grown and encountered new clans and nations, one lesson holds true above all others - we must fight for our place in the world or fall to others doing the same.\n\nWith the help of our new assassins, we will teach the world a different lesson: that walls whisper, and shadows silence"
 H85_infiltrate_the_railyard_title:0 "Infiltrate the Railyard"
 H85_infiltrate_the_railyard_desc:0 "Er-Natvir: The Railyard. Once a bustling hold of dwarven trade, the tracks have long fallen silent in the wake of the fall of Aul-Dwarov. We don't yet control the centre of the Dwarovar, but we must do so in order to expand further south.\n\nThis ought to be the perfect test for the fledgling Shadow Daggers..."
 H85_take_er_natvir_title:0 "Take Er-Natvir"
 H85_take_er_natvir_desc:0 "It is done. The Daggers have pierced the Heart of the Dwarovar.\n\nWalls whisper. Shadow silence."
 H85_new_operations_title:0 "New Operations"
 H85_new_operations_desc:0 "The Shadow Daggers performed admirably when taking Er-Natvir, but there is always more to be done. Perhaps their next target should be more... personal.\n\n A hostile ruler, maybe? It would be awfully helpful if they were able to remove certain thorns from our sides."
 H85_new_talents_title:0 "New Talents"
 H85_new_talents_desc:0 "The very premise of the Intrigue Court has left us with plenty of potential members of the Shadow Daggers. With a slight push, we could bolster their ranks and expand their operations."
 H85_influences_from_the_court_title:0 "Influences from the Court"
 H85_influences_from_the_court_desc:0 "As expected, introducing our most skilled courtiers to the Shadow Daggers has made them far more effective. It's also provided an unexpected benefit - allowing us to exert more direct control over this once quasi-foreign legion."
 H85_enlightened_minds_title:0 "Enlightened Minds"
 H85_enlightened_minds_desc:0 "Dûr-Vazhatun was filled with books. Grand stories and ancient dwarven folk tales. Haunting ramblings, describing some "Astral Terror" in rushed, scratchy text. But, most importantly, pages upon pages of detailed notes that have served as great boons to our own mages."
 H85_the_trainig_facility_title:0 "The Training Facility"
 H85_the_trainig_facility_desc:0 "The magics learned from the Astronomer Hold have been invaluable, but none quite as much as the fascinating illusions our mages have been able to recreate. Already, prospective Shadow Daggers have been training with these "simulations" - we should build them a proper training facility and formalise this experimental teaching model!"
 H85_the_daggers_blade_title:0 "The Dagger's Blade"
 H85_the_daggers_blade_desc:0 "Our Shadow Daggers have been perfecting their craft for a long time. Many know the cleanest ways to kill a man as well as the back of their hand. They really are the shining standard of Truedagger's training!"
 H85_rumors_of_reclaimers_title:0 "Rumors of Reclaimers"
 H85_rumors_of_reclaimers_desc:0 "Dwarves have been sighted in the north ! The rumour seemed unlikely at first, but we quickly realized that it might be something more than just baseless whisperings. Now that our new refugees have confirmed it, our Clanboss must send an expedition to find these dwarves and strike them first, before they come and try to slaughter us all!"
 H85_dwarves_for_the_mines_title:0 "Dwarves for the Mines"
 H85_dwarves_for_the_mines_desc:0 "With the dwarves under our rule thanks to a successful pre-emptive strike, we now have a new group of subjects that must be put to work! Relocating them to our mining colonies sounds like a perfect job for them!"
 H85_a_grand_arena_title:0 "A Grand Arena"
 H85_a_grand_arena_desc:0 "Our people love the thrill of battle and have long been organising gladiator fights, somewhat in spite of their sneaky goblin heritage. To fulfil this desire for bloodshed, we can create a centralised gladiator arena near our capital. Let the battles begin!"
 H85_orcish_warriors_title:0 "Orcish Warriors"
 H85_orcish_warriors_desc:0 "Many orcs share the same bloodlust as our goblin gladiators - not to mention their disposition towards fighting. They would make a perfect challenge for our strongest fighters in the arena!"
 H85_green_farms_title:0 "Green Farms"
 H85_green_farms_desc:0 "Repairing the Vale's irrigation system is long, hard work, and many goblins lack the physical ability to see it done. Luckily, we have plenty of orcish subjects under our control who would be willing to lend a hand.\n\nIf they refuse? Well, I suppose we're not asking..."
 H85_fertile_lands_title:0 "Fertile Lands"
 H85_fertile_lands_desc:0 "There's an awful lot of goblins in our nation - not to mention our other non-goblin subjects. Repairing the Serpent's Vale irrigation system would ensure a constant supply of food to our citizens; they certainly can't eat serpentbloom and mushrooms forever."
 H85_down_the_dwarovrod_title:0 "Down the Dwarovrod"
 H85_down_the_dwarovrod_desc:0 " Mithradûm: the Hold of Mithril and Truth. Although their honest ways have no place in Truedagger, their material wealth will fill our coffers and provide our armies with stronger armour."
 H85_the_gate_to_escann_title:0 "The Gate to Escann"
 H85_the_gate_to_escann_desc:0 "Khugdihr: The Gates of Agate. Connecting the Serpentspine with Cannor, our control of this hold would provide us with access to the riches of Escann! A shame about the dwarven settlers... but they can easily be dealt with."
 H85_improve_the_mines_title:0 "Improve the Mines"
 H85_improve_the_mines_desc:0 "The dwarves in the mines have found new mineral riches! Surely, they wouldn't mind being asked to dig deeper to find more?"
 H85_make_them_suffer_title:0 "Make Them Suffer"
 H85_make_them_suffer_desc:0 "We goblins have always been hated and mistreated by the other races of the Serpentspine. The orcs enslaved us. The dwarves confined us to the dank, dark caves. Now it's our turn to stand atop the others.\n\nOur slaves have been working well, but there is always more to be done. After all, who cares if a slave dies?"
 H85_riches_of_the_serpentspine_title:0 "Riches of the Serpentspine"
 H85_riches_of_the_serpentspine_desc:0 "The Serpentspine is full of diamonds, rubies, gold, and more! In our mining endeavours, we have found some good veins to exploit. Of course, it won't be us doing the dirty work."
 H85_our_enemies_enchained_title:0 "Our Enemies Enchained"
 H85_our_enemies_enchained_desc:0 "Some of our farms and mines, despite being run almost entirely by slaves, have expanded tenfold! We ought to centralise and take direct control over the wealthiest of them, by exerting our will over our orcish and dwarven subjects."
 H85_fellow_slavers_title:0 "Fellow Slavers"
 H85_fellow_slavers_desc:0 "With our discovery of Cannor, we've learned that we aren't the only ones to enslave orcs. If we can establish good relations with our fellow slaver nations, we will gain access to a very profitable market. Khugdihr, as the gateway to Cannor, would be a perfect place for a new auction house!"
 H85_the_bloody_arena_title:0 "The Bloody Arena"
 H85_the_bloody_arena_desc:0 "The arena in Verkal Vazkron is known across Halann! Parents whisper to their children of "The Bloody Arena", where the most savage of the world's races claw, rip, and tear into one another.\n\nWell, even if it is bringing us some diplomatic disdain, it's very good at keeping the bloodthirst of our people in check."

 flavor_truedagger.2.title:0 "The Goblin Flood"
 flavor_truedagger.2.desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] surveys the storied halls of Amldihr, frowning.\n\nWhen the holds of the Kingsrock were seized, the Clanboss had been seeking a grand home for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people. In that regard, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe]'d been successful. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had not, however, accounted for the message such an endeavour would send.\n\nBarely a month after Amldihr had fallen, the first of the outsider goblins had arrived. Before long, they were showing up in droves, flooding in through the gates and tunnels, seeking a new home of their own.\n\nThe hold is already damaged from years of orcish misuse, and these refugees are hardly helping matters!"
 flavor_truedagger.2.a:0 "Hopefully the pillars hold..."
 flavor_truedagger.3.title:0 "Orcish Refugees"
 flavor_truedagger.3.desc:0 "The messenger cowers before the Clanboss, bowing so low to the ground that his nose brushes against the stone floor.\n\n"N-news from t-the w-w-watch, Boss. Orcs have b-been sighted along t-t-the northern border."\n\nInteresting.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] dismisses the messenger with a flick of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand. Of course, we didn't kill every orc that managed to escape Amldihr... but if they're mobilising, and so close by...\n\nPerhaps a pre-emptive strike is in order."
 flavor_truedagger.3.a:0 "We have found new enemies!"
 flavor_truedagger.4.title:0 "Courtiers and Assassins"
 flavor_truedagger.4.desc:0 "Walls whisper. Shadows silence. Thus is the creed of the Shadow Daggers, from their inception to now.\n\nWord has reached our Clanboss that the courtier faction of our elite assassins has subverted control of the group."
 flavor_truedagger.4.a:0 "Impressive..."
 flavor_truedagger.5.title:0 "All Rails Lead To..."
 flavor_truedagger.5.desc:0 "History remembers the greatest conquests as grand, impressive battles. We know differently. We know that, when we moved on Er-Natvir, the real combat unfolded in the shadows of their hold.\n\nIt was almost too easy. Subvert a bitter captain of the guard and pay her handsomely to sell us military secrets. Arrange a contract with a well-connected smuggler, and sneak a few assassins into the hold through his secret network of tunnels, allowing them to occupy key parts of Er-Natvir and murder a few officials along the way.\n\nAfter that, with their defences weakened, all our assassins needed to do was take out the leadership, one by one. Some deaths were quiet. Others were gruesome, even for a goblin's standards. All served to spread fear and discontent.\n\nWell before our armies arrive, not one Dagrite will feel safe in their home, let alone behind their walls. By the time our forces are spotted down the ancient railway line, the citizens of Er-Natvir will be fearful enough to throw open their gates and welcome their new protectors."
 flavor_truedagger.5.a:0 "Masterfully done."
 flavor_truedagger.8.title:0 "Assassination Succeeded"
 flavor_truedagger.8.desc:0 "We have been assassinated"
 flavor_truedagger.8.a:0 "We have been assassinated"
 flavor_truedagger.9.title:0 "Assassination Succeeded"
 flavor_truedagger.9.desc:0 "Walls whisper. Shadows silence.\n\nOur assassination attempt has succeeded. With their ruler dead, our target finds itself in tatters, desperately trying to find the culprit.\n\nOf course, we were never there..."
 flavor_truedagger.9.a:0 "Perfect..."
 flavor_truedagger.10.title:0 "Assassination Failed"
 flavor_truedagger.10.desc:0 "Walls whisper. Shadows silence. Most of the time.\n\nDespite the best efforts of our assassins, our target continues to walk, talk, and rule. Worst of all, a few of our finest Daggers lost their lives in the attempt, exposing us!"
 flavor_truedagger.10.a:0 "Mortifying!"
 flavor_truedagger.11.title:0 "The Jiestedenok"
 flavor_truedagger.11.desc:0 "Jiestedenok - the Lucky Child. The first of our Clanboss' heirs, born deep within the royal halls of our capital.\n\nMany more will follow. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe]'ll have to be as lucky as his namesake."
 flavor_truedagger.11.a:0 "The first heir is born!"
 flavor_truedagger.13.title:0 "Death in the Night"
 flavor_truedagger.13.desc:0 "Walls whisper. Shadows silence.\n\nOne of our heirs was discovered slain in the night, likely killed by one of their siblings. Thus is the way of the Intrigue Court."
 flavor_truedagger.13.a:0 "One head falls. Another takes its place."
 flavor_truedagger.14.title:0 "Assassin Caught"
 flavor_truedagger.14.desc:0 "It appears that one of our Clanboss' children sent an assassin after a sibling, in perfect Truedagger fashion.\n\nWe don't let just anybody into the Shadow Daggers. This one certainly wouldn't have made the cut."
 flavor_truedagger.14.a:0 "He had the spirit, at least?"
 flavor_truedagger.15.title:0 "Dawn Slaughter"
 flavor_truedagger.15.desc:0 "Walls whisper. Shadows silence.\n\nOne of our nurses, investigating the strange silence from her assigned royal bedchambers, discovered something terrible this morning - five of our children, slaughtered in the night!"
 flavor_truedagger.15.a:0 "Awful..."
 flavor_truedagger.15.b:0 "Awfully impressive!"
 flavor_truedagger.16.title:0 "Overconfident Heir"
 flavor_truedagger.16.desc:0 "Our heirs are always at each other's throats, as is the way of the Intrigue Court. Sometimes though, one gets a little too ambitious.\n\nIn this case, a plot by one of our children has been uncovered - they plan to murder the Clanboss [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self! How should we deal with this little upstart?"
 flavor_truedagger.16.a:0 "What a shame. Execute them!"
 flavor_truedagger.16.b:0 "It was quite a detailed scheme, though..."
 flavor_truedagger.17.title:0 "Missing Gold"
 flavor_truedagger.17.desc:0 "Not all of our assassins stick solely to murder. It appears that one of them has sneaked into our treasury and made off with a good portion of our gold!"
 flavor_truedagger.17.a:0 "Annoying, but quite impressive..."
 flavor_truedagger.18.title:0 "Courtiers In The Court"
 flavor_truedagger.18.desc:0 "Some of our most skilled and influential courtiers have approached several of our heirs with proposals - assistance in taking the throne, likely in exchange for power, wealth, or some other boon.\n\nWhilst we'd never discourage our heirs from seeking outside help, the courtiers expanding their influence in the Intrigue Court might not be a good thing..."
 flavor_truedagger.18.a:0 "Let them help!"
 flavor_truedagger.18.b:0 "We shouldn't let them interfere..."
 flavor_truedagger.19.title:0 "Successful Assassination"
 flavor_truedagger.19.desc:0 "Walls whisper. Shadows silence.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is dead. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] corpse was found strung up outside the throne room, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throat slit. Inside, toying with the crown, waiting on the Clanboss' throne, was one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heirs, smirking at the shocked attendants as they crowded in.\n\nIt appears Truedagger has a new ruler..."
 flavor_truedagger.19.a:0 "Terrifying... but incredible, nonetheless."
 flavor_truedagger.20.title:0 "Heir in the Arena"
 flavor_truedagger.20.desc:0 "The arena is a place for ogres and orcs - not for goblins. Despite that, one of our heirs has been pestering us to permit them entry. Apparently, they want to "test their mettle" against the strongest opponents possible."
 flavor_truedagger.20.a:0 "Unorthodox, but why not?"
 flavor_truedagger.20.b:0 "Let us put an end to these foolish ideals."
 flavor_truedagger.21.title:0 "Heir in the Training Facility"
 flavor_truedagger.21.desc:0 "Nothing stops our heirs from taking advantage of our training facility, but few prove themselves competent enough to actually do the dirty work of assassination.\n\nOne of our heirs, however, has done just that, and has apparently taken to the training very well!"
 flavor_truedagger.21.a:0 "A good initiative"
 flavor_truedagger.22.title:0 "Heir Poorly Trained"
 flavor_truedagger.22.desc:0 "Despite showing great promise, our heir has left the training facility having drawn the wrong conclusions from their efforts. Though they might still prove themselves in other ways, they'll never be as competent as they could have been."
 flavor_truedagger.22.a:0 "Rework the curriculum! This can't happen again..."
 flavor_truedagger.22.b:0 "Our heir should've tried harder!"
 flavor_truedagger.23.title:0 "A True Warrior"
 flavor_truedagger.23.desc:0 "Against all odds, our heir has taken down every opponent we threw at them - goblin, orc, and ogre alike.\n\nThe crowd adores them, and they are now known as one of Truedagger's foremost warriors!"
 flavor_truedagger.23.a:0 "That's my kid, right there!"
 flavor_truedagger.24.title:0 "Heir Killed"
 flavor_truedagger.24.desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, our heir went and got themselves killed in the arena. They only managed to prove that they make a rather disgusting paste on an ogre's foot."
 flavor_truedagger.24.a:0 "Idiot..."
 flavor_truedagger.26.title:0 "The Last"
 flavor_truedagger.26.desc:0 "Out of all of our Clanboss' children, one now stands alone.\n\nSurrounded by the corpses of their siblings, they have persevered through the trials of the Intrigue Court.\n\nThe throne of Truedagger waits for them."
 flavor_truedagger.26.a:0 "Walls whisper. Shadows silence."
 flavor_truedagger.27.title:0 "Heir is an Idiot"
 flavor_truedagger.27.desc:0 "By some cruel twist of fate, the last surviving of the Truedagger heirs is an absolute idiot. \n\nClearly, the inner workings of the Intrigue Court aren't infallible. Perhaps the courtiers saw them as an easily-manipulated puppet, or perhaps their siblings simply didn't see them as a threat, and killed each other until none were left."
 flavor_truedagger.27.a:0 "A disgrace... but thus is the way of Intrigue Court."
 flavor_truedagger.28.title:0 "Shifting The Swamp"
 flavor_truedagger.28.desc:0 "Things are changing in the Serpent's Vale.\n\nThough they were always somewhat free to live how they liked, the goblins we found living amongst the ogres were never seen as anything more than second class citizens. Now that we've taken control, the giantkin have begun moving away from the village, where the inhabitants have found themselves with an unprecedented level of influence over their once-rulers.\n\nPerhaps this is symbolic of our future rule over the entire Serpentspine!"
 flavor_truedagger.28.a:0 "Tell the world of this goblin resurgence !"
 flavor_truedagger.30.title:0 "Running Water"
 flavor_truedagger.30.desc:0 "After many years of hard work, the irrigation system in the north of the Vale has been fully repaired!\n\nAlready, fresh water rushes down the canals to feed our crops. Soon, tiny green sprouts will be seen springing from the earth, straining to reach the sun. Maybe the world outside of the Serpentspine isn't that bad, after all?"
 flavor_truedagger.30.a:0 "Bountiful farms under a blue sky."
