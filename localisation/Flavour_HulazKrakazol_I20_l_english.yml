 flavor_krakazol.1.t:0 "A Temporary Solution"
 flavor_krakazol.1.d:0 "Though we cannot fight the command in our current state, we do have one option to ward them off. We have built up a sizable cache of ale, of a quality that should be far higher than what the hobgoblins are used to. If we offer them a large number of barrels in tribute, we might be able to win ourselves some temporary safety. Though it would slow our ale production down, the peace of mind would surely be worth it."
 flavor_krakazol.1.a:0 "Roll out the Barrels!"
 flavor_krakazol.1.b:0 "That sounds like cowards' talk!"

 flavor_krakazol.2.t:0 "An Offer of Ale"
 flavor_krakazol.2.d:0 "A band of, surprisingly, dwarves, have arrived at court with what appears to be massive caches of Ale. These dwarves claim they hail from the hold of Hul-az-Krakazol, and they bring us an offer. In exchange for massive amounts of ale, we would allow these dwarves to continue this reclamation effort peacefully."
 flavor_krakazol.2.a:0 "Tell the dwarves we accept their offer."
 flavor_krakazol.2.b:0 "No hobgoblin should ever need these vile "Ales""

 flavor_krakazol.3.t:0 "Another Key"
 flavor_krakazol.3.d:0 "With each passing month more and more dwarves arrive at the gates, eager to put their hands to use. Quickly our population grows, and prosperity is at hand. Among the recent arrivals is an old, haggard dwarf by the name of Otgad. He approaches our ruler with a simple, yet cryptic message: "Have you found Strâmolgiv yet?"\n\nThis question is met with confusion as to what he is talking about. He takes a deep breath and explains: "Strâmolgiv, the Great Ale Giver," he explains, "was once the pride of Hul-az-Krakazol. A legendary brewery that, in ages past, supplied all of Aul-Dwarov with the finest ales and brews dwarvenkind has ever known!" He pauses and looks around into the intrigued faces of the dwarves listening. "I am a descendant of the great brewmaster Erig, and with me I have his legacy: The key to Strâmolgiv!" He reaches into his ragged coat and takes out an intricate key. A key which begs for its lock to be opened."
 flavor_krakazol.3.a:0 "Let the search begin"


 flavor_krakazol.4.t:0 "Strâmolgiv"
 flavor_krakazol.4.d:0 "At last we have found the entrance to the brewery. Just as the old tales that we have since discovered promised us, the brewery was valiantly defended by Erig Darkbarrel and his brave companions. Piles of skeletons surround the door, a solemn sight to behold.\n\nAt last, Otgad walks towards the door. He places the key into the lock and looks around at the crowd that has come to see the legend realized. "This is a great occasion. From father to son, this key has been waiting to return to this very place. It is my honour to recover the legacy of my ancestor." He falls silent and turns the key. The locking mechanism stirs to life, gears and chains rattling through the stone as the doors swing open."
 flavor_krakazol.4.a:0 "Into the great halls!"
 flavor_krakazol.4.tooltip:0 "§YNew Missions§! will be unlocked after the §Yexpedition succeeds§!"

 flavor_krakazol.5.t:0 "Tastes Like Metal"
 flavor_krakazol.5.d:0 "After a long while of waiting and anticipation, a liquid, like mercury, came out of the pipes of Strâmolgiv to fill a barrel beneath the piping. Its consistency was fast-flowing but as thick as syrup, and its calm surface indistinguishable from a mirror. Having a pint full feels like lifting a hammer from the table with each sip. Drinking it doubles the weight of the drinker and many dwarves almost died of asphyxiation while wrestling; we are yet to decide if that is an honourable way to die or not. This extra weight, however, is good for exercise and steadying yourself in combat. No beast topples a dwarf with Burezen in their belly!"
 flavor_krakazol.5.a:0 "Iron in hand. Iron inside. Red iron spillage soon in sight!"


 flavor_krakazol.6.t:0 "A New Challenger Appears"
 flavor_krakazol.6.d:0 "Finally, the council has decided upon a way to select a new monarch. Open to any dwarf brave enough to try, a great tournament is being held, with the crown of Hul-az-Krakazol as the grand prize. Contestants have to down a whole keg of ale before every match, which they only win when their opponent vomits, loses consciousness, or dies. The tournament rages for several days, with the number of candidates dwindling every match. After the final fight, a blacksmith named Gorick Irongut is finally crowned as the new king, still partially covered in his last opponent's breakfast."
 flavor_krakazol.6.a:0 "Glorious!"


 flavor_krakazol.7.t:0 "Unlimited Power"
 flavor_krakazol.7.d:0 "Now the thing with the abhorrent ale called Boot Beer… we had, apparently, left the sourness lever on the 'on' position when we should have instead turned the sweetness knob 2 times to the left and half-press the cloudiness button while simultaneously pumping the carbon valve back-and-forth; or something like that. The now-bootless Danir managed to find a manual, which was sadly too stained and touched by time to be of any actual use. The one page that was readable was encased in a thin layer of some glass-like material to preserve it. The page contained the recipe and knobs and switches to a generally good ale; and a further mention of more fine tuning options in the piping of Strâmolgiv running even deeper in the mountain caverns…\n\nWe have now decorated the wall of the control room with the preserved page of the manual and use the rest of the book as a footrest. Now we know that the brewery of the ancestors runs deep and there's still much to explore. But first, let's try to brew some drinks to make our journey bearable!"
 flavor_krakazol.7.a:0 "Cheers to Strâmolgiv!"


 flavor_krakazol.8.t:0 "Blacking Out"
 flavor_krakazol.8.d:0 "In drunken dream we walked alone, narrow roads of cobblestone. 'Neath the flame of a lantern, we turned our beards to the cold and damp. Then our eyes were stabbed by the flash of aeon's light. That split the night. And touched the taste of Gripoldur…\n\nWe all knew that Dwarovar Dark was a nostalgic drink, but this? This hit different. It wasn't as nostalgic as it was… somber."
 flavor_krakazol.8.a:0 "We woke up different than when we passed out."


 flavor_krakazol.9.t:0 "Double Blow"
 flavor_krakazol.9.d:0 "There were few sources of light in the great Gate-Hall of Tuwad-Dhûmankon, but the bright lights emanating from deeper inside the hold reflected on the steel of armour, blades, and muskets, sometimes brightened up by a flash of gunpowder. As the fighting pushed back and forth over the scarred granite floor, the different armies could be identified less by sight than by sound. The shouts and sharp, snapping orders of the Command troops. The shrieking battlecries of the goblin slaves. And the guttural battle songs of the dwarves of Hul-az-Krakazol. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] sing right along, as they grimly cut themselves a path forwards through the mass of metal and flesh ahead of them.\n\n"Our hold and home be far or nearby,\nFor honour and glory we fight and we die!\nWith a cut and a slash,\ntheir bodies we rend,\nour enemies we smash,\n'til we meet our end."\n\nThey knew where they had to go: the hobgoblin officers had entrenched themselves on the Great Terrace, overseeing the hall, flagging commands to their troops below. Finally, they had cut themselves a way towards the broad spiral staircase embedded in the wall. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] halted his song, and barked a few quick orders. "Ordgrim, Dolbar, have your warriors guard the entrance. The rest of you, with me!\n\nThe staircase was already littered with corpses. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] made sure not to step on them as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] rushed up the steps. Two figures came down the steps, and one flash of an axe later they joined their kin on the ground. Finally, they rushed through the gate of the Great Terrace, cutting into the ranks of the goblin and hobgoblin nobles and officers gathered there. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sensed a flash of steel behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], turning around to see [Root.Heir.GetName] jump in front of a blow meant for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. As the body of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] child collapsed, [Root.Monarch.GetName] swung [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] axe at the killer. A crowned goblin head fell to the ground. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stared at the corpse of [Root.Heir.GetName] for but a moment, then collected [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] and scoured the battle around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. A helmet with an ornate red plume was visible behind a row of hobgoblins. The head of the snake. [Root.Monarch.GetName] launched [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] at the warriors, cleaving [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way towards [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] quarry. Five axeblows later [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had reached him, and three more axeblows later [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had killed him. [Root.Monarch.GetName] tried to shout triumphantly, but found [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not have the breath to do it. A hobgoblin spear was lodged in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest. [Root.Monarch.GetName] slumped to the ground, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands gripping the shaft of the spear in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest, pulling it out in one jerk. A flash of pain, then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt nothing. The sounds of metal on metal filled the great balcony, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] could still make out the battle songs from the Gate-Hall below. With [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] last breath, [Root.Monarch.GetName] rasped along to the words."
 flavor_krakazol.9.a:0 "'til we meet our end…"


 flavor_krakazol.10.t:0 "Soft Spoken Hard Drinkers"
 flavor_krakazol.10.d:0 "The other races often whine about dwarves being too tough to handle but this might finally be it. It's no cure, as there is nothing to cure, but the gentle softness of Bardsnaevin manages to soothe the dwarven temper and turn the heads of many dwarves who would have stormed out of the argument."
 flavor_krakazol.10.a:0 "We agree to disagree, for now…"


 flavor_krakazol.11.t:0 "The Amethyst Offer"
 flavor_krakazol.11.d:0 "A dwarf approaches the monarch with a single, simple request: That we hand over the lands that the dwarves have been working on for the recent time. An interesting offer, but voices among the court are divided. There are those that are sympathetic to the dwarven cause and are willing to sell the land, but there are others who think the status quo should be upheld. What are we to do?"
 flavor_krakazol.11.a:0 "The dwarves shall have the land"
 flavor_krakazol.11.b:0 "It is ours, and it will be so"


 flavor_krakazol.12.t:0 "The Exiled King"
 flavor_krakazol.12.d:0 "Our diplomat arrives at the lavish home of the Exilarch, the exiled king of Grôzumdihr. He has lived in peace and prosperity for ages, but has become lazy and indecisive over the years, an unsuitable disposition for such an important figure to our cause. After pleasantries are exchanged he calls for lunch, where 'all delicate matters' can be discussed. These delicate matters, however, are not the state of his hold, but the actual delicacies that he has enjoyed for so long. As the day continues our diplomat tries to explain the urgency of our reclamation, and how essential a secured Grôzumdihr is, but his words fall on deaf ears. The next few days also bring no significant improvements to our relationship with the Exilarch, but on the fifth day he finally calls the diplomat into his private chambers, where he rests on a large couch.\n\n"I have thought about what you have said over the past days," he begins and takes a sip of wine, "how you have appealed to my honour and pride, to our shared past and our future, and I must say, I am impressed with your idealism. But your people are young and your spirits are full of a fire that will quickly consume us all if we do not quench it appropriately." He offers a glass of wine to our diplomat. "I have waited, and I can still wait, until the time is right to make a move." He nods gravely. Our diplomat loses heart, having hoped that something might finally change, but alas, the Exilarch is still unwilling to devote himself to his inheritance.\n\nThe next week a missive from Hul-az-Krakazol arrives: "If Exilarch unwilling, offer own expedition. If he agrees, send word back." With these new instructions the diplomat once again approaches the Peridot Dwarf. "What is it this time, your constant nagging begins to annoy me".\n"Your majesty, I understand that you wish to make sure that the time is right for your reclamation and that it is safe for you to return."\n"Yes, and?"\n"How about we, the dwarves of Hul-az-Krakazol, send in an advance team of our own to gauge the dangers within before starting any reclamation efforts?"\n\nThe Exilarch silently stares at the diplomat for almost a minute before he reaches for some grapes. "If you wish, then I see no harm in it. You have my blessing, but do not disturb me further, you have spoiled my appetite…""
 flavor_krakazol.12.a:0 "Finally Grôzumdihr shall be reclaimed"

 flavor_krakazol.13.t:0 "Return of the King?"
 flavor_krakazol.13.d:0 "The Green Gate of Grôzumdihr swings open, the gems sparkling in the afternoon sun of Rahen. In front stood many dwarves, humans, and even harimari witnessing the grand occasion, the reopening of the Peridot hold. And there, in the middle of it all, perched upon a barge with pillows and drinks, lay the Exilarch himself, a self-secure grin on his lips. His bearers moved forward and put him down in front of our chief engineer, who had been working tirelessly day and night to restore his hold. No, that doesn't feel right. In what way was this his hold? He has done nothing for it, it was our people that brought it back from the brink.\n\n"I must commend you on the great feat you have achieved here," the Exilarch ruminates, his suave voice trickling through the air. "I graciously accept your offering…"\n\n"No."\n\nSilence, all chatter in the onlookers falls quiet. From behind the engineer came an unexpected voice, grave and full of authority. "You have done nothing for this hold while we have worked ourselves to the knees restoring it. You have no right to it, no more than we have." From the shadow behind the gate walks [Root.Monarch.GetName], in full regalia. "By any right except that of birth, this is our hold. We have laboured while you drank and ate without a care in the world. We, and Grôzumdihr, have no need for a lazy, complacent, and indifferent dwarf. Away with you, return to your estate and indulge in those petty pleasures. May your people, who have braved Rahen for as many years as you have, who have laboured to find a life as we have, enter. But neither we nor they need a king indifferent to their struggles.""
 flavor_krakazol.13.a:0 "We have no need for a Lazylarch"

 flavor_krakazol.14.t:0 "Return of the Peridots"
 flavor_krakazol.14.d:0 "The Green Gate of Grôzumdihr remains open for all who wish to enter, except the Exilarch, who had been cast out of these halls ages ago, and again recently. Yet his people, the Peridots, remain scattered throughout Rahen, dwarves who have not sat idly by, revelling in their riches but working hard and well, dwarves who have earned a place among the dwarves of Grôzumdihr. We shall welcome them with open arms."
 flavor_krakazol.14.a:0 "Speak, friend, and enter"


 flavor_krakazol.15.t:0 "Liquid Gold"
 flavor_krakazol.15.d:0 "We long thought the legends of Mîdar of Clan Asra to be just metaphors for his knowledge of banking and his keen eye for business, but we might stand corrected. Drinking Logrzotr Guln, named after its almost jelly-like texture and, obviously, golden colour, has given its drinkers a limited ability to turn what they touch into gold. The limited nature of the ability being the gift here, thank the Ancestors, or the whole of the Dwarovar could turn to the gilded metal. At most an area of one metre around the touch point was affected and the effect varied for different materials with stone and metals changing the most.\n\nWe must, however, limit this, as overuse at best risks the value of gold dropping and at worst it might lead to our downfall."
 flavor_krakazol.15.a:0 "But it's still gold, right?"


 flavor_krakazol.16.t:0 "The Olthrun"
 flavor_krakazol.16.d:0 "The great glass foundries of Grôzumdihr are ablaze, rivaling the masters of Orlghelovar, to create a magnificent work of eternal art, a throne made of hollowed glass, strong as steel, yet light and pristine. Day and night our top dwarves are working on it, perfecting every bend, every push and pull, so that it will be the greatest throne to have ever graced this world.\n\nAs the Olthrun is raised out of the hardening chamber it glitters in scintillating colours, still ablaze and red. Many "Ooooh"s and "Aaaah"s could be heard as it was placed gently on its pedestal to cool down. As the hot colour subsided the true crystalline glory could be witnessed.\n\nNow that it has cooled down it is ready to be filled with our most prestigious concoctions. Multiple interlacing pockets, each equipped with pipework and faucets, were flooded with ale. Our nobility looked on in awe as it slowly filled up, ready to be tapped. Many shed a few tears as they basked in its glory as if they had witnessed the gods and ancestors themselves descend upon our very halls.\n\nNot even foreigners who enter our halls as diplomats, ambassadors, or traveling merchants, could withstand the intoxicating beauty of the Olthrun, they fell to their knees in awe and bafflement, and few dared to look upon it directly."
 flavor_krakazol.16.a:0 "All (h)ale our Olthrun, greatest throne in the world!"
 flavor_krakazol.16.tooltip:0 "To sit upon the §YOlthrun§! is the greatest honour. More §Gskilled combatants§! will enter the §YOlzonog§! for the chance to sit upon it.\n§YTier 2 Ales§! will also be §Gcheaper§! to produce"

 flavor_krakazol.17.t:0 "Drinks all Around"
 flavor_krakazol.17.d:0 "The old tradition of Valkumol was not a bad one, but these days we have need for grander gestures. Now, every advisor, noble, crafter, and farmer is gathered. All Amethyst Dwarves wait outside the great halls, each with a flagon in their hands provided by the state. The Haraz-Valkumol begins today. From this point on, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and all those who come after him will drink with their people. A dwarf that cannot hold their drink is no Amethyst, and a dwarf that does not drink with their fellows cannot lead us."

 flavor_krakazol.17.tooltip:0 "§TThe Keglord will be able to drink with his people via decision§!"

 flavor_krakazol.18.t:0 "Thunder Kegs"
 flavor_krakazol.18.d:0 ""Fire!" \n\nWith a loud thunder, the cannons fire in unison, their payloads soaring through the cave. Just before they hit the rock, they explode, igniting the heavily distilled ale inside. A wave of liquid fire blankets the cave floor, lighting up the cave walls all the way to the cannon positions. \n\nThe lead engineer looks proudly at [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], a wide grin splitting his singed beard. "So what do you think?""
 flavor_krakazol.18.a:0 "They're a thing of beauty!"


 flavor_krakazol.19.t:0 "Waste Not"
 flavor_krakazol.19.d:0 "As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] tours the many taverns of our realm, one of the taverns is recovering from a massive barfight. Shards of glass and broken chairs are everywhere and the establishment is barely left standing with many dwarf-sized holes in the walls. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] along with his entourage decide to assist in cleaning up what is left of the place.\n\nWith all the shards of glass and splinters of wood gathered up, the drunk [Root.Monarch.GetName] demands it all be thrown into Strâmolgiv. Everyone looks confused as they all think the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has finally lost it and gone mad, but then [Root.Monarch.GetName] speaks again and corrects that only the shards of glass are meant to be used as an ingredient and not the wood, as the splinters should be reserved for the fires of the brewery. This doesn't clear any of the confusion but now the, also drunk, court mage says it's a brilliant idea, too!\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] then singlehandedly names the drink Andlraezbit. It is still debated if the name means Shattered Nose and is a reference to the bar fight or if [Root.Monarch.GetName] was just too drunk that night to speak clearly. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] hasn't commented on the matter as they remember none of it."
 flavor_krakazol.19.a:0 "We are drinking glass, what the-"


 flavor_krakazol.20.t:0 "Give me Death"
 flavor_krakazol.20.d:0 "In the centuries of decay following the Last Days of the Dwarovar, the fall of our once-great empire under the mountains of Halann, other creatures have "inherited" the tunnels and caverns. But these inheritors are not good caretakers, in fact, they mock our art, our culture, our very history. Since our return to the mountains we have wrestled control over the caves from them back to us with considerable success. So successful, indeed, that the orcs, goblins, kobolds, and all the other dark-dwellers pose no challenge to us anymore. There is no glory in killing for us anymore, at least not killing goblins and their ilk.\n\nBut we crave a challenge. The dream of conquering mighty beasts, besting even the most foul and devilish creatures the depths of hell has to offer. The thrill, the glory, the personal satisfaction of plunging blade to hilt into an enemy far beyond us, to bring down a hammer on cracking skulls like. That is what we are, who we are.\n\nSo, after years under the ground, mostly content with our hold, we look outwards again, not for fertile lands and old allies, but to find a new challenge worthy of our attention. The vast lands of Rahen have much to offer in that regard: Beneath the thin veil of civilization that the Rajas uphold there is a land of beasts and monsters who are practically waiting for us, waiting to be slain."
 flavor_krakazol.20.a:0 "The dream calls us."


 flavor_krakazol.21.t:0 "And I'm digging a hole"
 flavor_krakazol.21.d:0 "The now named Hyg Azgrafa had the most unexpected effects on its drinker. The, appropriately named, Digger's Delight made its enjoyers feverishly obsessed with digging as they said it has never been easier before. This was proven true, as the mithril's great adaptability transferred to some decree to the drinker. This gave their bodies the ability to readjust unconsciously if a change or just a bit extra was needed.\n\nLong term exposure to the drink increases these adaptable traits even more and allows us to use them in all kinds of construction and management of areas."
 flavor_krakazol.21.a:0 "We have unlocked the dwarven potential"


 flavor_krakazol.22.t:0 "Spicy"
 flavor_krakazol.22.d:0 "Finally our great plan is put to motion and the nose tingling aroma of spices fill the halls of Strâmolgiv. If spices give food that extra kick it will work just fine in drinks as well! Just throw ALL the spices in and let our troops wake up to the lovely smell of Bâlazhargûn in the morn of battle and live to drink more for the next!"

 flavor_krakazol.23.d:0 "Who cares about some higher-than-thou alelosophers. They just drink their higher-than-thou ale in their higher-than-your apartments. We are better and WE will find the solution to why 'inedible' things seem tasty. They might be inedible but they are NOT undrinkable. We'll even call it Grôn Azludok as, in our theory, the drink will most likely be green and it shall make us greater thinkers than any of those pissy alelosophers."

We are even ready to TIP you so you might buy some actually really excellent good alE! From us, of course.\n\nAnd as mentio- like we- AS WE SAID BEfore, there's many dwarven workers in the area already so saying 'no' is like, like a really bad move and we are ready to raise our pint- eh, our weapons to claim what is actually already ours.

They actually corrected us that they wouldn't give it for any amount of money and they were outraged that we would even consider their faith 'up for sale'. We also learned many new curse words and that High Philosophy doesn't forbid said cursing; even from their people of the cloth.\n\nAnyway!\nNow we just have to get the lands old fashioned way and try to make the war quick and painless. We'll even try to go around the temples to avoid angering them further. We just hope that given time they will acknowledge that those temples are better cared for in our hands than they ever would be in theirs."

 flavor_krakazol.26.d:0 "Now this right here, this is the stuff.\nJust a sniff of the repulsive stench of the ale makes even a strong dwarven stomach turn sideways and do a flip. But just the stench alone also makes you terribly, terribly drunk, so we'll call it a success! It instantly caused a row of challenges in the court where many try to prove that they're dwarf enough to drink a whole pint of aptly named Brothbur, Belly Breath, without even flinching an eyelid. Anyone who succeeds in such a task is sure to get the respect and approval of any dwarf. Our Greatest Drunkard [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of course succeeded and reaps the benefits of it.\n\nIt is good we decided to listen to those mages about the colourful stones in Zotrstunz."

 flavor_krakazol.27.t:0 "End of Night"
 flavor_krakazol.27.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] held up his spyglass, surveying the walls of the Black Temple from his rooftop vantage point. Even though the rest of the city of Yinsheng was solidly under dwarven control, the Black Temple was not. The gates of that unholy structure would not budge, presumably reinforced by magical and other means in preparation for the siege. To his satisfaction, however, he was quickly able to identify several structural weaknesses. [Root.Monarch.GetName] collapsed and stashed his spyglass, and slid back down the rope of his grappling hook, landing between the cannons which were already being rolled through the streets. "Aim below the windows and above the buttresses," he barked at the general who had been waiting for him. "We can make a climbable breach."\n\nIt took two salvos for the cannons to create the breach. [Root.Monarch.GetName] braced himself, half-expecting the screeching of the Jiangfu monstrosities that they had been fighting in the city to come pouring out. Instead there was only grumbling and scraping of metal, as the dwarves that had gathered before the wall waited impatiently for orders. [Root.Monarch.GetName] clambered onto the rubble, gesturing with his axe for his dwarves to follow him. Carefully peering through the opening, he could see a hallway extending in both directions and a grand staircase, illuminated only by the light from the breach. No movement was visible apart from the dust in the air that was still dissipating from the blasts. "I've got the stairs," he said, turning to face his lieutenants that had gathered behind him. "Unkon, left. Drim, right. And have your dwarves bring torches."\n\nThere was an uncommon silence among the dwarves. No laughter, talk or songs - the dark hallways only illuminated by torchlight looked like they could have been in the Dwarovar, but they certainly did not feel that way. Suddenly, a loud shrieking fills the air, as a horde of Jiangfu monstrosities and figures in shadowy robes come pouring from the doorway ahead. The robes are familiar: they were also worn by the soldiers they had fought earlier, and are far more resilient than they look, able to absorb axe blows like armour. [Root.Monarch.GetName] aims his blows precisely, every swing directed at the head. One falls. Two. Three. By then, the slayer's instinct had taken over. The rest of the fight is a blur, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] only regains himself as he stands amid piles of blood and limbs."

 flavor_krakazol.29.d:0 ""NOW!" Six dozen dwarves carrying large barrels emerged from the siege gully, immediately accompanied by a suppressive volley of musket fire from behind them. A defensive volley from the ogres' human auxiliaries on the walls answered. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] peered over the edge of his cover, closely following his advance guard's movement. Some fell from the gunfire, but most managed to reach the bottom of the wall and started to throw the barrels together onto three piles, on the corners where the walls and towers intersect. It had been extremely difficult to manoeuvre artillery over the rough terrain of the Demon Hills, and the positioning of these Shirgrii monastery-forts nestled in the hills did not allow for good lines of fire. So they made do. [Root.Monarch.GetName] waited until the dwarves had cleared away from the barrels, signalled the order, and covered his ears.\n\nWith a thundering sound, the barrels of gunpowder exploded. [Root.Monarch.GetName] held his head down, as he heard a piece of rock hit the ground behind him. As he got back up, he noticed the guns on both sides had stopped firing; it seemed the smoke from the gunpowder had filled the air, and taken away all visibility. This was even better than expected. [Root.Monarch.GetName] grabbed his axe, and shouted the first lines of a battle song.\n\n"High up is fame and glory, our ancestor's might\nHeld up by the heroes of yore\nShort we may be, but we'll reach there if we fight\nAs we climb a mountain of gore!"\n\nHe grinned as the dwarves joined in, and vaulted onto the edge of the gully. He gave two quick knocks on his axe with his gauntlet to signal the attack, and rushed through the smoke towards the breaches."

The spirits are then extracted into the tanks with the aid of the vacuum by touching them with the Trona Wand, which is connected to the pack by a wire.\nThe builder behind this magnificent invention decided to name it after himself as the Roton Backpack.\n\nAfter a plentiful 'harvest', we have a sizable stock of spirit barrels ready for the great brewing machine.\n\nLet the drink be named Ol Azubrdwar, the Ancestor's Ale, and may every pint be in their memory!"

A smile cracked the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s face. "Now, lezz set 'im free"\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stepped into the ritual circle, spread his arms, and began the incantations. Unlike his speech just before, there was no mumbling or slurred words. every single line was crisp, and delivered with a roaring power. Thormir, experienced with rune magic though he was, was not familiar with this ritual, and did not know how [Root.Monarch.GetName] had learned it; he had only prepared the circle according to his lord's instructions. He did, however, recognize fragments of the incantation, and they filled him with unease. Meanwhile, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] continued, his incantations growing louder. Slowly, a pained grimace appeared on his face. Thormir panicked as the incantations turned to screams. "My lord! I'm getting you out!" He attempted to grab the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but the ritual circle repelled him, and Thormir felt a powerful force throw him up into the air before landing several paces away. Stunned, he looked on in horror as his [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was lifted up, his arms outstretched as if pulled on by invisible ropes, the air crackling with magical energy. Then the energy released, wiping away the circle and sending the runestones flying. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] fell to the ground, and Thormir rushed to his side. "It is done…" The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] mumbled, raising his head from the grass. "By my ancestors…" He did not finish his sentence, and his head dropped back down on the grass, lifeless.\n\n"Dagrin's beard, what is that?" One of the dwarves exclaimed, pointing at the sky. Thormir looked up. A falling star tracked through the sky, but slowly, burning with a tail of purple flame. Thormir thought for a moment. "The tail is getting shorter…" he paused. "It is turning. It is coming this way! GET DOWN!" The dwarves of the expedition threw themselves to the ground, and moments later a violent impact shook the ground. Thormir stood up and looked around. Just north of them, a plume of colourful smoke rose from an impact crater. Thormir gestured for the others to follow him, and walked to the edge. A large meteorite, astonishingly still mostly in one piece, sat in the centre of the crater. The strange patterns on the rock suggested it was not a mineral Thormir was familiar with, and a yellowish liquid poured from a crack of the outer layer. A familiar scent filled the air. Thormir slid down the edge, walked to the meteorite, and collected some of the liquid in his hand. Carefully, he brought it to his lips and tasted."

It has gotten to the point that the crater has filled up entirely, submerging the meteorite in ale.\n\nFrom the edge of the crater, a small brook has formed which runs downhill into the sea, where it mixes with the water. The ale itself is extremely potent, to the point of being able to get an Amethyst Dwarf extremely drunk with only a single sip. Many more Amethyst Dwarves have travelled to Tipiphiya, to experience this miracle that our old [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has granted us."

Slaying the beast was a monumental effort, a true test of strength, worthy of a celebration. But with this celebration there is a nagging thought in their mind, the knowledge that with this triumph something other than the beast died: A worthy death."
 flavor_krakazol.101.d2:0 "At last the Kirin falls. Raiuja's body falls to the ground and a great thundering roar, as if the storm above was writhing in agony fills the atmosphere, blasting rocks and plants away until it finally subsides. Suddenly the sky clears up, rays of sunlight shine upon Raiuja's body. Each scale glitters and gleams with a myriad of colours, the fur and horn still crackle with lightning. As the clouds part the entire plateau is doused in sunlight, Raiuja now a blue speck under a blue sky.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stands up and looks at the body in awe. Fighting Raiuja had been a profound, almost spiritual experience. The elegance with which it darted, the power of the lightning, the grace with which it rammed its horn towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it all was so much to take in.\n\nBut now it was done. Raiuja had been slain. This almost divine beast has been vanquished by none other than [Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hul-az-Krakazol. This achievement shall be sung until the end of time, immortalized through song and story, tale and myth!"
 flavor_krakazol.101.d3:0 "With a last tremor Halukandaran's only remaining head falls to the ground. Blood erupts from the throat, but the wound is quickly seared and closed. No more heads will grow, the hydra is finally dead. Its body lies motionless upon the plain, its thick legs have been broken, the torso slit open. Around the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] lay the remaining heads, each full of poison-filled teeth and sporting eyes that still exude the primal hatred of Halukandaran.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stands up, throws his weapon aside and looks upon his achievement. A wave of awe and fear overcomes him as he looks at his blood-soaked hands where his own blood had mingled with the thick, almost gooey coagulated hydra blood. He stands like this for a few minutes before he starts to move again, walking up to the hydra to carve off his trophy to take home. In his mind he can already hear the taverns sing of his achievement, his story put into the annals of Hul-az-Krakazol as the daring [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who stood against Halukandaran."

They could not find a single beast to slay. Uproar and immediate investigation followed this terrifying story, and soon the reason was discovered.

But not even the tiniest speck of the warmth reaches the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] up here, between the shivering peaks of the mountains. Ice-storms batter against cold, harsh rock and icicles the size of humans hang across the precipice. It has a strange beauty to it, like flutes and windchimes in a wintery night. Cradling this thought the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] moves deeper into the mountains. It is not ice nor music he searches for, it is the beast that dwells here: a fearsome Yeti, a huge menace that nourishes itself on foolish travelers on the border of its territory.\n\nThe trail of the Yeti appears, footprints in the fresh snow, each the size of a small keg. The guide points towards the track, but does not go on further. It is the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s duty to slay the beast. At last, following a winding path along the peaks of the Serpentspine he has come to the beasts den, a small cave, barely an indent into the surrounding rock. Loose, frozen meats are strewn across ground, pale and blue, and in their midst stands the Yeti, its white fur unkempt and bloodied. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] readies his weapon."

At its end lies the tail, a scaly, chitinous simulacrum of a scorpion, swinging back and forth. Then, suddenly, it jerks its head to the side. The keen eyes had noticed an intruder, a small, stout figure clamouring up the dunes: The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hul-az-Krakazol, although it didn't know this fact. The slaying monarch, however, knew exactly who his opponent was, and readied himself for a direct charge at its face."

As most living beings soon sleep soundly, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] travels through the abandoned roads of the countryside, with nothing but the moon and their lantern to guide them. He looks for tracks, but not just the tracks of any animal, no. The plump, four-toed footprints of Baku are what they search for. "Bakus hunt at night," his companion and guide had said, one of the few humans in the oni lands. "It is then when they seek out the dreams of the living.""

He follows in silence, as the tracks approach the place of hiding, a small crevice with excellent view of the village. There the ugly, multicoloured creature lies in wait, its elephant-snout twisting and twitching, the red scales and fur gleaming in the pristine moonlight. 'Almost an adorable creature," the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] thinks, 'were it not for the grotesque shape and haphazard mash of different animals…'\n\nAfter a short period of preparation, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decides to strike. The Baku has just rolled itself on its side, scratching its back on treebark, leaving the vulnerable legs and belly open for attack.

There, hanging far up, displayed prominently, is the trophy of Raiuja, the Storm's Fury. Truly a tale for the ages, a tale like few others. He absentmindedly flips through a book of old dwarven tales when something catches his attention: The story of one Thrimbongur the Nibbler, who was starving in the mountains when a spirit in the likeness of a horse appeared in front of him, a strange being with dragon-like scales and swirling hair and the mouth of a dragon-lion hybrid. 'Wait a moment,' the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] thinks, 'that sounds like Raiuja!' There is only one discrepancy: Raiuja never travelled as far south as this story is set. A strange coincidence…\n\nThen something unexpected happened. Deep within the archives of Hul-az-Krakazol a scroll was found. Its author: Thrimbongur of Thilgurhul. Within stood the tale of the Nibbler, but from his own hands, in his own voice. 'More Kirin,' [Root.Monarch.GetName] thought, that ought to do it.

 flavor_krakazol.155.d:0 "The people of Kradhungur and Maruvad speak of a legendary kirin within their lands, a locus for local worship and veneration. Raiuja, the Storm's Fury, they call it. The tales tell of the powerful storms it can conjure, lightning and thunder, wind and rain, a being of awe-some power, it's blue fur and scales permeated by yellow streaks, like lightning across the sky.\n\nThese tales, eventually reach Hul-az-Krakazol, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ears. The prospect of such a prestigious battle is alluring, and soon he has made up his mind: Whether it exists or not, if this beast can be found, it must be found, by none other than him, naturally, for this is a challenge fit only for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hul-az-Krakazol. It is not even three hours since knowledge of Raiuja had arrived that [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepared supplies to best this beast, or be bested by it. The following day the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] leaves the hold, ready to face whatever might stand in hisway.\n\nThe area around Maruvad is rocky and mountainous, with farming villages nestled between the harsh, but lush slopes of the Serpentspine. Sheep and goats graze along the fields as farmers milk and shear them.\n\nThe path leads further into the mountains, where the grazing fields become sparse, instead rock and stone are the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s constant companion. In the distance, suddenly, lightning strikes. As the thunder rolls over the mountains, reverberated by the walls of stone, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows: This is the way."

Turn around, I beg you, leave be what cannot be changed." She storms off into her house and bars the windows. With no one willing to tell the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] what he might do to defend himself, he wanders into the sparse forest. A grin runs over his lips. 'Lightning,' he thinks, 'what if I would cover myself with mud? Yes, surely that will shield me from its lightning.' He laughs. A flawless plan."

It is said that Raiuja moves with the speed of lightning itself, that no mortal has the mind to even understand how it strikes. 'Laughable,' [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks, 'if no one has survived an encounter, how would they know anything about it?' Nonetheless, there is a difference between recklessness and stupidity. He studied the area, took in everything he could and calmed himself in the face of the storm. From afar he watches a soldier during a morning routine, stretching and meditating. Suddenly inspired, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] follows the movements, which clears their mind, now focused on a singular purpose: Fight!"

 flavor_krakazol.158.d:0 "The ascend to the peaks was arduous, the landscape rugged and scarred by lightning. The rocks all had the same, sooty quality to each other, and soon even the mountains were alike near the heart of the storm. Finally, after climbing through a narrow divide, [Root.Monarch.GetName] reached a platform from which he could survey the area. Suddenly he heard a trickle of stones drop behind him. He turned around - and there it was.\n\nNothing could have prepared the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for the magnificence that Raiuja was. Perched on the precipice of a cliff it stood, its mane billowing in the powerful storm surrounding it. Lightning illuminated the mountains, rendering its body into a silhouette, a mighty shadow against the bright sky. Its yellow scales sparkled and reflected the light in myriad ways, the fur sparkling with static electricity. For a moment the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] just stood there, marvelling in the majesty of this beast.\n\nThe legendary kirin turned its almost draconic head towards the lower cliff upon which the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stood. For a moment the storm went silent as Raiuja examined the strange figure, stout, well armed with the finest weapons. Within its cunning eyes the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] saw how resolve and pride won over caution, that Raiuja had deemed this fight worthy, a preposterous notion in the eyes of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but it did mean they wouldn't have to climb up the cliff. Instead Raiuja descended along the slopes until it stood proud and tall before them.\n\nThere was no moment to be lost, upon the smallest sign of action from the kirin the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] ran forwards, ready to tackle the beast to the ground. Suddenly the storm erupted into thunderous onslaught, with lightning striking left and right. The fur, now fully charged, attracted the bolts of electricity, redirecting them to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as he dashed out of the way, brandishing his weapon.\n\nThe time has come: Either [Root.Monarch.GetName] or Raiuja must fall."

 flavor_krakazol.160.d:0 "Even for the most dilettante slayer the hydra's track is unmistakable. A terrifying line of devastation, trees bent like toothpicks and scorched earth, jammed riverbeds and ruined villages. They are constantly on the move, devouring whatever is in their path, supplanting ecosystems with wastes. Only during mating season hydras stay in the same spot for a few months until the hydralings are hatched and well underway to rampage through the countryside.\n\nIt is convenient, therefore, that the hydra [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to hunt is currently breeding and has claimed a rocky hill as its lair. From there it destroys the towns and villages, sending the populace fleeing to the nearby - and fiercely guarded - cities. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] looks over the hill and expertly notices that the hydra is currently on the hunt, leaving the eggs well hidden, but ultimately unguarded. But caves are a dwarves expert, and the eggs, each the size of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] himself, are soon found and destroyed. For a moment he hesitated. He could leave them be and hope they would hatch so that future generations of slayers would still have hydras to slay - no, he thinks, better to deal with the lot in a swift and decisive manner.\n\nWith the good deed done the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] looks around.

As it gulps down the last poor cow it starts moving its green and scaly body towards the rocky hills nearby, to its lair.\n\nHydra's are difficult to kill, mainly attributed to their unfortunate ability to regrow severed heads. Once one is cut down, two grow in its place, unless one sears the wound close. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] chuckles and looks in his bag.

Yetis, manticores, cockatrices, even bakus were prominently displayed to inspire awe in the many slayers-to-be that would try to emulate the heroic battles and deaths of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s.\n\nYet a quiet sadness grows within him, a fear almost, that there was nothing left to prove himself. He could merely replicate the deeds of his ancestors, triumph them in numbers, drinking more ale, slaying more beasts, but there was only old ground left to retread.\n\nExcept there was. Decades ago news had reached Hul-az-Krakazol of a beast so powerful that it could devour entire landscapes to still its hunger, that it drinks entire rivers dry to quench its thirst, a monstrosity in name, shape, and fame: Halukandaran, the Swallower of Rivers\n\nNo one had dared to approach it. Tales tell that a confrontation with it would be akin to suicide, only much, much more tormenting as its acidic breath and sharp teeth will inflict unthinkable pain. There was no shred of doubt in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s mind that this would be, had to be his mark upon the annals of Hul-az-Krakazol. Halukandaran would be his legacy, and even if he died - a likely outcome given the precedents - he would still be one of the few brave souls to set eyes on the beast."

 flavor_krakazol.166.d:0 "Having successfully tracked down Halukandaran, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s next step was figuring out where it was going. It would be unwise to attack it in an open field, where it could see him from miles away. Luckily there was a slightly rocky area nearby, with some cliffs and hills beneath which he could try to ambush the massive hydra.\n\nBut this would not be so easy because Halukandaran had no inclination to leave the open fields brimming with prey. It would need to be lured away, but with what? What could a hydra of this size be possibly interested in?\n\nThere was no way around it: [Root.Monarch.GetName] needed help. He would need to prepare a bait of monstrous size to fit his quest, like a herd of cows or pigs or something similar. He looked around and tried to make out some homestead that had not been ruined by the hydra, and, to his joy, there was one just a few miles south from his position.\n\nWith quick steps he made his way to the human household, the farmer raising an eyebrow upon the arrival of such a kingly dwarf.\n\n"Well, well, Master Dwarf, what might you do here?" the farmer asked. "I wish to slay Halukandaran," the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] answered. "And I require your livestock."\n\nDespite initial reluctance and disbelief, in the end the farmer consented. [Root.Monarch.GetName] would pay twice the usual price of the farmer's livestock in order to use it as bait.They herded the animals into the hills and slaughtered some to stimulate the hydra's nose, and soon the steps came closer. The farmer put his hat to his chest. "By all that is good in this world, I wish you the best of luck." The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] nodded and thanked him for the help. And with Halukandaran nearing, the farmer left."

But there have been enough slayers who have overzealously ran into a battle with a foe they had no chance to beat. This would not happen to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], no. Even though he is at the peak of physical and mental ability, Halukandaran has many deadly abilities that have to be accounted for. The acidic breath, the venomous teeth, the sandpaper skin, and, of course, the many, many heads.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye he had spotted 'Vrûngrash', a potent antivenom that is not available in the Serpentspine due to its need for sunlight. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] kneels down on the ground and takes out a mortar and pestle. 'A good sign,' he thinks as he grinds the herb into a fine paste and fills it into a bottle, creating a makeshift potion. Then he carefully coats his skin with a cream made from lime and alkaline mud to counteract at least some of the acidic vapor.\n\nAfter these preparations are done he looks around. Halukandaran was already finished with the bait, has trailed further along and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to catch up again, and then it would finally be time for this mythical confrontation."

The hydra seems to be an insurmountable foe, one of such awe-full magnitude that it can devour entire landscapes with its thousand-teethed maws and wide throats. A deep rumbling, a mockery of laughter escaped the hydra as it reeled his head back and exhaled a steaming, burning, stinging vapour. He could feel the cream reacting, giving off some warmth, which could be an indication that the preparations were working, or perhaps that was just the heat of battle.\n\nOne head embedded its teeth into the ground just where [Root.Monarch.GetName] had stood a second before, pumping its venom into the ground. Plants wilted and the ground cracked from the sheer potency, and the hastily crafted potion suddenly seemed less and less reassuring, but it was better than nothing. He whirled around and slid under the hydra's legs, ramming a blade into its belly. A multitudinous roar filled the air that sent the trees shaking. From there the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] jumped around the leg and up the tail that the hydra wielded like a mace. Now mounted on its back he could get to work on the throats and start searing the wounds shut before even more heads showed up.\n\nThen Halukandaran suddenly jerked around, throwing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] off, hurling him against a nearby tree. Breathing heavily he looked at the hydra as it drew closer, blade in his hand. Only one head remained. Now was the time. The maw twitched and jolted towards him and he raised his blade. This was it. This was the end, one way or the other."
