    effelai_worship.2.d:0 "Her song, a constant reminder of our oath to her. To protect from external threats, and to keep these vast jungles cleansed of those that would seek to corrupt her. But there's more to her beauty than just this swamp of horrors. Vast regions surround us, each a unique part of her being, and each equally important to the survival of the others. We must go forth and visit each region, collecting the various boons offered to us along our journey, until finally we can settle down. With our goal completed, we can make the last region we visit our home. Only after the harsh trials we are about to face, will we have once again earned the right to be her protectors.\n\n\n\n§G"Each region contains a holy site we must visit. Picking an efficient path could be important, as we have no idea what dangers loom on the horizon."§!"

    effelai_worship.50.t:0 "The Gleaming Tower"
    effelai_worship.50.d:0 "Ragged and tired, one of our scouts returns to us after being missing for the last two days. Through the cheers of our people and his family, he tells us that he has found something - a spire of glass, a tower of light that he could not break. Lost in the Effelai, he says, Chahinanito herself showed him the way to this ancient structure, jutting out of a mountainside, buried in roots and overgrown ferns. There, exhausted from fleeing dangerous wildlife, and under the faint light of the tower, our Scout was prepared to die. That is, until he found a door. Hiding inside, he managed to evade the creatures before returning to us, though he never ventured further in than the initial chamber."
    effelai_worship.50.a:0 "Arrange for an expedition. We shall explore what our Goddess has laid out for us."
    effelai_worship.51.t:0 "Exploring The Ruins"
    effelai_worship.51.d:0 "Due to his exhaustion, and its rushed nature, our scout's description of the ruins they had found did little to prepare us for its grandeur. A spire built out of a transparent crystal with a blue hue, standing tilted on the side of a mountain it previously sat atop. Perhaps it had fallen during a landslide, but the construction held long enough for us to finally walk within its halls. Inside, a dilapidated crystalline stairway was lined with the visages of curious people. They seemed like us, but their ears were more pointed, their bodies relatively hairless, and some among them had skin far paler than any among our people.What was this place in times long past? Who were these people? Our expedition could only guess as they continued ascending, narrowly avoiding death in times where the steps gave way into the chasm below."
    effelai_worship.51.a:0 "Time obscures its truth jealously."
    effelai_worship.52.t:0 "The Gleaming Prism"
    effelai_worship.52.d:0 "Reaching the summit, our expedition was face-to-face with an extremely odd room, obscured in darkness in spite of the seemingly transparent material of the tower. Stranger still, the room was awash with plantlife of all shapes and colors, including some that were not familiar to the experienced hunters of the forest around us. In the center of the room sat a pentagonal prism, slowly spinning on its axis and held aloft on a pedestal by some unseen force. One amongst our party recounts seeing a vine grow towards the prism, only to burn away upon crossing some invisible perimeter. With night and its myriad horrors fast-approaching, the members of the expedition saw it fit to grab the prism and return it to our lands for further study. Unfortunately, neither our chief nor our wisemen can discern the purpose or even usage of this device, as it powered down once removed from the crystalline pedestal."
    effelai_worship.52.a:0 "Safeguard it in a secure location. We might learn more some day."
    effelai_worship.53.t:0 "Leechmen Attack"
    effelai_worship.53.d:0 "As we travel, it is known to all our people that to live in these blessed lands we must survive all sorts of dangers. Many creatures and carnivorous plants are known to us, and some rightfully inspire fear in the youngest child to the most experienced hunter. And yet, only one danger inspires hatred. The vile Leechmen, acting from their swamp in service to some dark deity, are the truest expression of corruption known to us, and their methods of battle cruel and unnatural. Once again these monsters seek to uproot us from their swamp. We must return their cruelty in kind."
    effelai_worship.53.a:0 "To the palisades!"
    effelai_worship.54.t:0 "The Leechmen's Crimes"
    effelai_worship.54.d:0 "The horrid Leechmen's attacks continue in both scope and evil. If this not were enough, scattered reports have reached us that yesterday, a group of them assaulted a foraging party, taking them prisoner on their canoes to be sacrificed to their horrific deity. There is outrage within our people, as they no longer feel safe even on mundane tasks usually relegated to those without the physical aptitude to partake in hunts. Perhaps not all is lost, however, as signs of a struggle point our trackers to the location of their settlement."
    effelai_worship.54.a:0 "Arrange for a war party to free our people. Give them whatever it takes."
    effelai_worship.54.b:0 "Without that foraging party, we scarcely have enough to feed ourselves. We must flee."
    effelai_worship.55.t:0 "Creatures of the Dark"
    effelai_worship.55.d:0 "Yesterday, as dusk fell, the sounds of steps approaching were heard - perhaps by too few, perhaps far too late - as a creature of blinding speed made its way through our camp. Those among our people that survive recant the horrible visage of a creature whose posture crudely resembled our own; lacking in hair or any other features, its body covered in pale, off-white skin save for its rotting yellow teeth. It ran with the speed and grace of a jaguar, tearing into the necks of the brave warriors who grabbed their spears in time to mount some sort of defense. It dragged them, one by one, into the dark of the underbrush. Their final screams are the last anyone save Chahinanito will know of their fate, as we have not found their remains."
    effelai_worship.55.a:0 "Goddess… Protect us…"
    effelai_worship.56.t:0 "Renewal on the Burned Coast"
    effelai_worship.56.d:0 "Aruá paddled onwards, her canoe braving the small coastal waves as she made her way down what her people once called the Burned Coast. She, too, once referred to it as such, but over the years travelling to the fish traps set among its reefs it's clear to her that the region is anything but scorched. Dry, perhaps, but not barren. Her time by the coast is spent with the distant company of small herds of fowl as they feast on small patches of grass. Therein, the odd sapling has grown taller and sturdier than what their teeth can pierce, and so will continue to grow as do the majestic green towers of her homeland. Perhaps, she muses, she's brought a piece of home with her."
    effelai_worship.56.a:0 "Chahinanito is always with us."
    effelai_worship.57.t:0 "Boons Of The Jungle"
    effelai_worship.57.d:0 "Chahinanito is a fickle goddess, and she takes away as often as she gives. But when she gives, she gives generously; On our path lies a tree, felled and shattered into several pieces of extremely strong wood. The wood is already broken into small enough pieces to transport on our wagons and canoes, and large enough to make planks or tools out of. Whatever we need, Chahinanito provides."
    effelai_worship.57.a:0 "A song, in thanks to our great goddess!"
    effelai_worship.58.t:0 "A Budding Hope."
    effelai_worship.58.d:0 "Little Jaikó was terribly sick. His body burned hotter than it should and he was sickly, bed-ridden, and miserable. His family and the tribe had accepted that he was not long for this world. His brother, however, did not. Running into the Effelai, he found salvation. A flower - Maga, in our language - that is extremely rare and typically only buds once over its decades-long life, and is known for its curative properties. The specimen the child found had two buds flowing gently in the wind, instead of one. The first bud, as good custom dictates, was used to cure his brother, but what should we do with the second?"
    effelai_worship.58.a:0 "Give it to our Chief, a safeguard for their time of need."
    effelai_worship.58.b:0 "Save its seeds for when we find a place to call home permanently."
    effelai_worship.59.t:0 "The Song of Strife"
    effelai_worship.59.d:0 "Silence. Not a word said, just mindless slaughter. The Song Servants, thralls to the will of evil, gathered around our people as they fished on a shallow riverbed. The only sound was their hurried steps through the rushing waters towards our people, defended only by their fishing spears and their faith in the Goddess. Many fell, though some survived long enough to return to our lands and warn us of the ravenous beings. One of them recounts a melody that he had never heard before."
    effelai_worship.59.a:0 "We sing tonight for protection."
    effelai_worship.60.t:0 "Mushroom Money"
    effelai_worship.60.d:0 "The tall, fungi-clad Lai'i are a mercurial bunch. Their culture is alien to us in many ways,in no small part due to the qualities of their homeland. Still, the Parura merchants are prized and widely-respected, and while in our time we have dealt with many different tribes, have found no people that do not speak the language of commerce and mutual benefit. The Lai'i give us many of their odd mushrooms with a taste reminiscent of meat, while we in turn provide them with what we have in abundance in our forest home, like sturdy wood, large hides, and intricate pottery. It is a peaceful arrangement that serves to bring our peoples together."
    effelai_worship.60.a:0 "Chahinanito blesses both our people on this day."
    effelai_worship.61.t:0 "Wild Growth"
    effelai_worship.61.d:0 "On the edges of the Mushroom Forest, in places not yet overtaken by the peculiar flora of that place, our scouts report an odd scene. Animals, in their hundreds, gathering on these edges only to seemingly die. Their bodies were then found in various stages of decomposition, being used by the fungi as fuel for their massive stature and as growing beds for new spores. Perhaps more concerning is that some of these grow on nearby trees, as well as the odd pile of fungi that seems to grow from the bodies of Lai'i. Regardless of their origin, this might explain how the odd forest sustains and replenishes itself."
    effelai_worship.61.a:0 "As long as they don't touch us, we will be fine."
    effelai_worship.62.t:0 "Fellow travellers"
    effelai_worship.62.d:0 "Our camp was alerted at dawn by rustling in the leaves moving towards us. Our best warriors were mobilized, only to find a small tribe of Effa'i making their way through the jungle. They had wounded among their number, and beseeched our aid. As we treated those individuals, the remainder offered trade, and we managed to barter some essentials for their shinier effigies and necklaces before they continued on their way."
    effelai_worship.62.a:0 "Chahinanito teaches us to respect fellow hunters, lest we be hunted ourselves."
    effelai_worship.63.t:0 "A Haunting Chorus."
    effelai_worship.63.d:0 "There are strange reports from [Root.GetName], of strange songs that are being heard across the province. Although these songs do not come from any discernible direction, our people are convinced there are Song Servants, slaves of the Effelai jungle, who are causing this."
    effelai_worship.63.a:0 "Horrors surround us."
    effelai_worship.64.t:0 "Orwai'i Wisdom"
    effelai_worship.64.d:0 "”You all serve an evil will! It must be burned away for our people to survive!” He called out. “The Servants, they are creatures of your forest's creation! You too shall be enthralled and subsumed!” said the old Orwai'i, grey-haired and dishevelled, who had wandered into the center of our village as stunned onlookers stared on. Before long, our people armed themselves to set upon the heathen before he could bring Chahinanito's wrath upon us for his disrespect. However, by the time they arrived, he was gone."
    effelai_worship.64.a:0 "What a strange individual."
    effelai_worship.90.t:0 "The Lecchmen's Massacre"
    effelai_worship.90.d:0 "Corpses. Strew about a bloody altar and dull, discarded flint knives. Our foraging party, our people, had already been sacrificed by the time we had arrived at the leechmen's camp. There is nothing we can do for them, but to cut down the monsters that did this. They will know the wrath of Chahinanito, and a people spurred to action through violence. Their hissing calls through twisted mouths will be silenced in a night of dancing blades and running blood."
	effelai_worship.90.a:0 "Kill. Them. All."
    effelai_worship.100.t:0 "Exploring Effelai"
    effelai_worship.100.d:0 "With our short visit to this region of Effelai completed, it's time for us to choose the next site to visit. Our adventuring party should continue to scout ahead, and search for the next holy site.\n\n\n\n§R"If we want our warriors to be brought with us when we migrate, bring them back to the capital before affirming this decision"§!"
