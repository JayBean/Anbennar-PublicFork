We may exploit this wealth to add to our own coffers in a time of great need. That being said, we will have to repay what we have taken at some point, and such exploitation will no doubt discourage trade for some time."
 estate_gerunanin_enlist_naval_experts:0 "Enlist Naval Experts"
 estate_gerunanin_enlist_naval_experts_desc:0 "Hobgoblins do not have nearly the same history with naval warfare as humans do, and we must acknowledge this. By tapping into our human subjects, we may be able to more easily recruit able admirals, at the cost of denying ourselves some chances to develop our own maritime experience."
 estate_gerunanin_autonomous_enclaves:0 "Autonomous Enclaves"
 estate_gerunanin_autonomous_enclaves_desc:0 "Managing the Gerunanin is no easy task. That being said, there are ways to make the task easier, even as we expand our reach. Allowing for trusted subjects to form autonomous enclaves will not only allow us to manage more of them, but also increase loyalty to the Great Command."
 estate_gerunanin_reduced_tribute_requirements:0 "Reduce Tribute Requirements"
 estate_gerunanin_reduced_tribute_requirements_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Gerunanin prefer to keep their wealth to themselves. While to exempt them from payment would be unthinkable, we could consider reducing their obligations. While this will give us fewer resources to work with, it will no doubt make the Gerunanin more complacent."
 estate_gerunanin_syncretism:0 "Syncretism"
 estate_gerunanin_syncretism_desc:0 "Many of our subjects have yet to accept our teachings, but instead cling to their old faiths and beliefs. By blending some of their ideas with our own, we may encourage these holdouts to begin seeing things our way. This may cause some dissatisfaction among the more committed of our ranks, however."
