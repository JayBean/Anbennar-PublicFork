We may exploit this wealth to add to our own coffers in a time of great need. That being said, we will have to repay what we have taken at some point, and such exploitation will no doubt discourage trade for some time."
 estate_gerunanin_enlist_naval_experts:0 "Enlist Naval Experts"
 estate_gerunanin_enlist_naval_experts_desc:0 "Hobgoblins do not have nearly the same history with naval warfare as humans do, and we must acknowledge this. By tapping into our human subjects, we may be able to more easily recruit able admirals, at the cost of denying ourselves some chances to develop our own maritime experience."
 estate_gerunanin_autonomous_enclaves:0 "Autonomous Enclaves"
 estate_gerunanin_autonomous_enclaves_desc:0 "Managing the Gerunanin is no easy task. That being said, there are ways to make the task easier, even as we expand our reach. Allowing for trusted subjects to form autonomous enclaves will not only allow us to manage more of them, but also increase loyalty to the Great Command."
 estate_gerunanin_reduced_tribute_requirements:0 "Reduce Tribute Requirements"
 estate_gerunanin_reduced_tribute_requirements_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Gerunanin prefer to keep their wealth to themselves. While to exempt them from payment would be unthinkable, we could consider reducing their obligations. While this will give us fewer resources to work with, it will no doubt make the Gerunanin more complacent."
 estate_gerunanin_syncretism:0 "Syncretism"
 estate_gerunanin_syncretism_desc:0 "Many of our subjects have yet to accept our teachings, but instead cling to their old faiths and beliefs. By blending some of their ideas with our own, we may encourage these holdouts to begin seeing things our way. This may cause some dissatisfaction among the more committed of our ranks, however."
 estate_gerunanin_neighbor_reporting_program:0 "Neighbor-Reporting Program"
 estate_gerunanin_neighbor_reporting_program_desc:0 "Our human subjects have shown reluctance to give up their shaman friends and family, leading to large revolts and wasted Korashi. Rather than force, a gentle touch could do wonders: create a self-interested incentive structure for people to report the shamans among them to authorities. A universal bounty of thirty pieces of coin per head will be issued."
 estate_gerunanin_irregular_household_searches:0 "Irregular Household Searches"
 estate_gerunanin_irregular_household_searches_desc:0 "While community-oriented peacekeeping methods work, at the end of the day we need a strong police force in place to stop criminals. This is the Ronpunyo-Ura, who investigate suspected Shamans and Shaman-sympathizers. From there, they have authority to search the dwelling of all investigated persons so long as they obtain a warrant from their internal judges."
 estate_gerunanin_front_line_fodder:0 "Front-Line Fodder"
 estate_gerunanin_front_line_fodder_desc:0 "The anti-Shaman beliefs of the Command would have one believe that we would never use them on the battlefield. Far from it, it is because we understand their danger that we likewise understand their power. A line of Shamans do not need to be armored, can be trained without requiring weaponry. Their destructive potential is equivalent to that of any edan, and can be deployed as such--along with Korashi-equipped handlers of course. Men must die for the Command, but it need not be men we cherish."
 estate_gerunanin_mage_powered_explosives:0 "Mage-Powered Explosives"
 estate_gerunanin_mage_powered_explosives_desc:0 "The sheer destructive force of the mage is a sight to behold, meteors raining down like cannon fire. This property of magic can be wielded and channeled: clasp a mage firmly in place and ground up Korashi into powder, then force the mage to ingest it. In small doses, this can produce mind-altering effects. In large quantities however, it causes the mage to firmly expel all the magic in their body in the form of a single, large explosion of pure power. Some mages, to their credit, do manage to survive the experience."
