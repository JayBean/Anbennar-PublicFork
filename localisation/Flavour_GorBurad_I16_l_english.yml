 gor_burad_flamefungi_farms_title:0 "Flamefungi Farms"
 gor_burad_flamefungi_farms_desc:0 "During our time living around the Firetop Mountain, scouts have spotted a strange kind of fungus in the surrounding caves, growing from basalt walls held warm by the mighty volcano. These plants seem to feed off of the volcano's heat. We should explore and utilize this strange property once we have accrued the necessary funds."

 gor_burad_molten_core_basalt_title:0 "Molten Core Basalt"
 gor_burad_molten_core_basalt_desc:0 "Basalt, the black volcanic rock, is abundant around Gor Bûrad, and, as luck will have it, is an excellent building material. This brings down both costs and construction time, thanks to the basalt almost always being immediately available practically for free."

 gor_burad_ensuring_autarky_title:0 "Ensuring Autarky"
 gor_burad_ensuring_autarky_desc:0 "Basalt dwarves pride themselves on their autonomy and our self-sufficient way of life without the need for outsiders. Now that we have secured enough food sources and building materials it is time to become more self reliant by defending what we have. We must forge weapons to assert our sovereignty over our domain!"

 gor_burad_basalt_trading_doctrine_title:0 "Basalt Trading Doctrine"
 gor_burad_basalt_trading_doctrine_desc:0 "We value our autonomy above all else, and now we have managed to become self-sufficient. Why then are we still letting foreign traders benefit from our hard work? Out with them, send them away at the gates!"
 gor_burad_basalt_trading_doctrine_trigger_tt:0 "We must not use the §YMaximize Profit§! or §YEstablish Communities§! in any active trade node."
 gor_burad_basalt_trading_doctrine_tt:0 "We will no longer be able to use the §YMaximize Profit§! or §YEstablish Communities§! trading policies. However, we will gain the ability to use §YImprove Inland Routes§! at all times."

 gor_burad_rebuilding_the_fireglass_forge_title:0 "Rebuilding the Fireglass Forge"
 gor_burad_rebuilding_the_fireglass_forge_desc:0 "Gor Bûrad was famous for the Fireglass Forge before its fall. Now, however, it lies not cold, as that is almost impossible near the volcano, but dead: unused and in disrepair. This, the pride and jewel of our hold, must be restored if we are to return our hold to its old glory."

 gor_burad_earthshaking_excavation_title:0 "Earthshattering Excavation"
 gor_burad_earthshaking_excavation_desc:0 "Much of Gor Bûrad was destroyed following the Fall of Aul-Dwarov. We must repair the damage and improve the hold's foundations. For that we need more building material. It is time to dig deep and unearth more rock, stone and especially basalt to continue the great restoration."
 gor_burad_earthshaking_excavation_tt:0 "This mission will (eventually) unlock more missions."

 gor_burad_restoring_the_hold_title:0 "Restoring the Hold"
 gor_burad_restoring_the_hold_desc:0 "Once, Gor Bûrad was a great forge, before the horrors of the Last Days of the Dwarovar. Now, however, all that remains are greenskin infested ruins. We, the new Basalt dwarves, cannot tolerate this! We must restore it to its former glory, no matter how much time, sweat, and blood it takes!"

 gor_burad_argrod_conquest_title:0 "Argrod Conquest"
 gor_burad_argrod_conquest_desc:0 "The only path into the rest of the Serpentspine from Gor Bûrad is the Argrod, so naturally, we must control it to ensure safety and that no enemies of ours can cut us off from our rightful lands. The Argrod must be ours!"

 gor_burad_escalating_the_situation_title:0 "Escalating the Situation"
 gor_burad_escalating_the_situation_desc:0 "The Serpentreach holds many riches that are controlled by the treacherous dwarves of Ovdal Lodhum. We must bring them under our control. We cannot rely on them to help us in an hour of need."

 gor_burad_borborduz_reignited_title:0 "Borbordûz Reignited"
 gor_burad_borborduz_reignited_desc:0 "In ancient times, the Borbordûz ensured a measure of civic stability in Gor Bûrad, where disputes could be settled above a lava pit. We will reimplement it, and reap the rewards!"
 gor_burad_borborduz_reignited_trigger_tt:0 "The §RBasalt Rage§! country modifier must give at least §Y+5 unrest§!."
 gor_burad_borborduz_reignited_tt_1:0 "§RBasalt Rage§! modifiers will be augmented to provide §Y1.5% morale§! per level."
 gor_burad_borborduz_reignited_tt_2:0 "There is a high chance that future Basalt Rage events will instead be Borbordûz events."

 gor_burad_the_trial_title:0 "The Trial"
 gor_burad_the_trial_desc:0 "Ages ago, the Garnet Dwarves wronged the original Gor Bûrad by leaving them to fend for themselves, and now the time has finally come to right this grudge. It is time that we put their monarch on trial to answer for the crimes of his people!"

 gor_burad_the_gate_hold_title:0 "The Gate Hold"
 gor_burad_the_gate_hold_desc:0 "Verkal Skomdihr, the Gate Hold, on the border to the Deepwoods is finally under our stewardship. With it being part of our nation, our control over the Serpentreach has tightened."

 gor_burad_securing_the_junction_title:0 "Securing the Junction"
 gor_burad_securing_the_junction_desc:0 "The Gorrod, as well as the associated tunnel are the only link that holds the Serpentreach and the rest of the Serpentspine together. We must seize control of this chokepoint in order to properly enforce our will on the Serpentreach."
 gor_burad_securing_the_junction_tt:0 "If Verkal Skomdihr has 50 development the Castle in Gorrod 1 will be upgraded to a Bastion."

 gor_burad_not_a_threat_a_promise_title:0 "Not a Threat, a Promise"
 gor_burad_not_a_threat_a_promise_desc:0 "Tempers are running high, heated arguments over our future relationship with Arg-Ôrdstun are erupting like pyroclastic bombs all over Gor Bûrad. But in the end, everyone comes to the same inevitable conclusion: The Diamond Hold will feel the heat of our wrath!"

 gor_burad_the_reckoning_title:0 "The Reckoning"
 gor_burad_the_reckoning_desc:0 "Despite claiming to be the hardest and toughest among Dwarvenkind, we have shown that even diamonds can be smelted down and reshaped into something more suitable to our nation. Arg-Ôrdstun has fallen!"
 
 # Missions, part b
 gor_burad_forming_the_steam_companies_title:0 "Rise of the Steam Barons"
 gor_burad_forming_the_steam_companies_desc:0 "Some merchants have suffered as a result of our isolation but others have turned inwards instead, pooling their resources to establish - and profit off of - new industries related to the lava flowing through the Bûradforge area. Given our situation, we need to encourage and empower these self-proclaimed Steam Barons."
 gor_burad_forming_the_steam_companies_tt_1:0 "Being at or above 20 innovativeness will halve the admin power cost of this mission."
 gor_burad_forming_the_steam_companies_tt_2:0 "The Burghers estate will become the §YSteam Barons§!, unlocking new privileges and disabling others, as well as enabling the §YSteam Industry and Innovation§! system. For details about this, see the associated privilege."

 gor_burad_replicating_success_title:0 "Replicating Success"
 gor_burad_replicating_success_desc:0 "The Steam Barons have approached us with a novel idea: By diverting lava into the Zarn caverns we could use the residual heat to power our production there."

 gor_burad_feeding_the_refugees_title:0 "Feeding the Refugees"
 gor_burad_feeding_the_refugees_desc:0 "Gor Burad has, over time, become a nexus for dwarvenkind and many dwarves that have been expelled from their homes have come to us. These refugees, however, need shelter and food. We should make this our priority so that they will, in turn, work for us!"

 gor_burad_cavern_dwelling_dwarves_title:0 "Cave Dwelling Dwarves"
 gor_burad_cavern_dwelling_dwarves_desc:0 "While the phrase 'Cave-Dwellers' has usually been said in reference to goblins, there has recently been a change in our own populace. More and more dwarves are entranced by the natural beauty of our basaltine caves and wish to spend their days there instead of in the safety of our own hold."

 gor_burad_relocation_efforts_title:0 "Relocation Efforts"
 gor_burad_relocation_efforts_desc:0 "Terrible omens are brought before our ruler: The volcano upon which our hold is built is dangerously close to erupting. We must immediately begin securing the perimeter and evacuating the residents of Gor Bûrad!"
 gor_burad_relocation_efforts_tt:0 "This event will move up to 6 development from Gor Bûrad to a random province in the Bûradforge area, repeating every 6 months until §YThe Eruption!§! begins."

 gor_burad_diverting_the_lava_title:0 "Diverting the Lava"
 gor_burad_diverting_the_lava_desc:0 "The lava is steadily rising and will eventually reach the upper levels of the Hold, where the population density is the highest. By diverting some of the rising lava, however, we will be able to delay when this happens."

 gor_burad_shadowforge_city_title:0 "Shadowforge City"
 gor_burad_shadowforge_city_desc:0 "With the continuing rise of lava in Gor Bûrad, our hold will soon become uninhabitable. This means, of course, that our capital infrastructure will be unusable. It was therefore decided to move our government to Molten Core, in the shadow of our hold, now called Shadowforge City, and wait out the eruption from there."
 gor_burad_shadowforge_city_tt:0 "The odds of Shadowforge City being targeted by the Relocation! event increases to 50%."

 gor_burad_ring_of_the_law_title:0 "Ring of the Law"
 gor_burad_ring_of_the_law_desc:0 "With Gor Bûrad and the arena therein lost, we have been unable to receive Borbordûz challenges. Let us construct a new arena in Shadowforge City to remedy this!"
 gor_burad_ring_of_the_law_tt_1:0 "Borbordûz can be held even if §YThe Eruption!§! is active."
 gor_burad_ring_of_the_law_tt_2:0 "This modifier will be removed at the end of the disaster."

 gor_burad_dealing_with_our_lot_title:0 "Dealing with our Lot"
 gor_burad_dealing_with_our_lot_desc:0 "Gor Bûrad is lost to us, for now. We cannot change this, and must calm the raging tempers this reality brings with it. Once that is done, we can start looking to the future and working towards restoring our Hold. Meanwhile, the Steam Barons have some interesting ideas..."
 gor_burad_dealing_with_our_lot_trigger_tt:0 "Basalt Rage must be at level 0."
 gor_burad_dealing_with_our_lot_tt_1:0 "\nProvinces in the Bûradforge area will have their mission modifiers converted to the appropriate Steam Baron Innovations."
 gor_burad_dealing_with_our_lot_tt_2:0 "\nFor more details about the §YSteam Industry§! system, hover over the §YOpen Steam Innovation Menu§! decision or the Steam Baron §YSteam Industry§! privilege."

 gor_burad_defending_what_is_ours_title:0 "Defending What Is Ours"
 gor_burad_defending_what_is_ours_desc:0 "It is clear that many of our people will dwell within the caverns for now, so we must ensure that they are adequately defended! Once again, the innovative minds of the Steam Barons have a proposal on how to accomplish such a strange task."
 gor_burad_defending_what_is_ours_tt:0 "Every province fulfilling the requirements will gain §Y+25% defensiveness§! and §Y+1 hostile attrition§! for 20 years, at the cost of killing 2 infantry regiments."
 
 gor_burad_we_cannot_look_weak_title:0 "We Cannot Look Weak!"
 gor_burad_we_cannot_look_weak_desc:0 "Without our hold and the Buradforge at our constant disposal, other countries will surely try to gain the upper hand against us. We need to protect ourselves against possible punitive action by building a new forge that can step in for the Buradforge while it is out of commission!"

 gor_burad_truly_basalt_hold_title:0 "Truly Basalt Hold"
 gor_burad_truly_basalt_hold_desc:0 "The glittering volcanic rock adorns the walls of Gor Bûrad, finally the last pieces fall into place and our grand hold has been restored from the terrible fate that has befallen it. Its new sheen awes all dwarves that walk through the halls. Layers upon layers of magnificent minerals are on display, expertly wrought into the very architecture. At its core, of course, lies the basaltine nature of our own kind, the black rock providing a sturdy foundation and building material."
 gor_burad_truly_basalt_hold_trigger_tt:0 "Gor Bûrad must have §Y0§! devastation."

 gor_burad_piping_the_river_title:0 "Piping the River"
 gor_burad_piping_the_river_desc:0 "The Sewer Hold. Disgraceful, how a Hold allowed itself to be labelled such. Despite this dishonour, we must delve into Hul-Jorkad to examine their accounts, as our scientists believe that this might allow us to extend the river of lava farther, which the Steam Barons insist will bring benefits to the realm."

 gor_burad_warding_the_river_title:0 "Warding the River"
 gor_burad_warding_the_river_desc:0 "Fire and heat brings change, brings prosperity, but it also brings devastation to the more heat-sensitive parts of our nation. To mitigate that, we could assign our mages to devise and place wards against the dangers upon our lava river."
 gor_burad_warding_the_river_river_upgrade_tt:0 "All current and future §RLava River§! modifiers will be upgraded."
 gor_burad_warding_the_river_GB_repair_tt:0 "Gor Bûrad can now be repaired!"

 gor_burad_retribution_title:0 "Retribution"
 gor_burad_retribution_desc:0 "The Diamond Dwarves thought themselves the masters of the Serpentreach. Hah! What a laughable suggestion. Let us show them just how wrong they are, by sharing our suffering with them! Flood Arg-Ôrdstun with lava! Show them the suffering we endure! The diamonds will melt!"
 
 # Missions, part c
 gor_burad_welcome_to_the_barons_playground_title:0 "The Barons' Playground"
 gor_burad_welcome_to_the_barons_playground_desc:0 "The restless minds of the Steam Barons have once again come to the aid and request of our ruler: With the capital fully restored they wish to be granted land surrounding Gor Bûrad so that they may test out the newest innovations that their teams of inventors and engineers come up with."

 gor_burad_expanded_dueling_tradition_title:0 "Duelling Tradition"
 gor_burad_expanded_dueling_tradition_desc:0 "By now, the tradition of Borbordûz duels is well-established in our realm, drawing massive crowds that inevitably cheer no matter who wins. As such, it will no longer be all that shocking if the ruler dies fighting."
 gor_burad_expanded_dueling_tradition_tt:0 "A Ruler or Heir winning Borbordûz now reduces the rage level by 2, rather than 1, and the ruler dying in Borbordûz no longer reduces stability."
 gor_burad_expanded_dueling_tradition_trigger_tt:0 "We must have accepted 30 Borbordûz challenges (currently §Y[Root.gor_burad_var_borborduz_accepted.GetValue]/30§!) OR have had the royal family participate in 10 Borbordûz fights (currently §Y[Root.gor_burad_borborduz_royal_participation.GetValue]/10§!)."

 gor_burad_a_glorious_new_arena_title:0 "A Glorious New Arena"
 gor_burad_a_glorious_new_arena_desc:0 "Following the recent discovery, voices have called for an even grander, more magnificent arena, a glorious display of our true artistic and inventive talent. In fact, our allies among the Steam Barons have already begun drawing up some blueprints for how such an arena could look..."

 gor_burad_finally_a_grand_gor_burad_title:0 "A Grand Gor Bûrad"
 gor_burad_finally_a_grand_gor_burad_desc:0 "Finally! Gor Bûrad has been restored to the heights of its former glory, and our people are celebrating with songs of our immortality. Yet we must continue making our Hold even grander, to surpass the Gor Bûrad of old must be the true goal of our delving, constructing and inventing. Gor Bûrad will surpass all other holds!"

 gor_burad_beneath_our_feet_title:0 "Beneath our Feet"
 gor_burad_beneath_our_feet_desc:0 "It has become clear that something lies beneath us, beyond just rock and lava. It will be a monumental undertaking, but we can begin to unearth what lies beneath our feet."

 gor_burad_our_grasp_solidified_title:0 "Our Grasp, Solidified"
 gor_burad_our_grasp_solidified_desc:0 "The Serpentreach now lies firmly in our hand, tight and clamped, we are the irrefutable masters of the mountains. As such, we must protect our status, something that the Steam Barons are most willing to help with."

 gor_burad_unreachable_reach_title:0 "Unreachable Reach"
 gor_burad_unreachable_reach_desc:0 "Under our leadership, the Serpentreach has been turned into a veritable fortress, teeming with cannons and lava. We control every entrance and exit to it, allowing us to keep out any foreigners who would try to charm and cheat us!"

 gor_burad_steam_baron_ascendancy_title:0 "Steam Baron Ascendancy"
 gor_burad_steam_baron_ascendancy_desc:0 "The dam has been a cornerstone of the power of the Steam Barons, giving us the power to tame the mountains and volcanoes, the very rock that we walk upon. Now the Barons have come up with a way to increase the output even further, a promise so irresistible that we have to follow up on it immediately."
 gor_burad_steam_baron_ascendancy_bulwar_contingency:0 "Since you deleted Bulwar, you must have §Y50000§! Ducats and §Y400§! Administrative Power to complete this mission."

 gor_burad_the_everraging_realm_title:0 "The Baron's Paradise"
 gor_burad_the_everraging_realm_desc:0 "The slowly bubbling lava river flows scenically next to the grand estates of the Steam Barons just outside of Gor Bûrad, the greatest hold of the Serpentreach. Through their influence, their ingenuity, could this country flourish, and, in turn, the nation gave them more freedom to act than they could have wished for. They live the life of feudal lords, ruling over their factories and corporations with a cast-iron fist, they are the hammer that strikes the anvil of invention, they provide the power that keeps the fiery heart of Gor Bûrad running. No one would ever oppose them now."
 gor_burad_the_everraging_realm_trigger_tt_1:0 "No estate other than the Steam Barons may have 30% or more influence."

 gor_burad_the_lava_must_flow_desc:0 "Already the holds of the Serpentreach run on lava, but now it is time to bring this marvellous substance to all reaches, all nooks and crannies, all caves and caverns. The lava must flow and vitalize all!"

 gor_burad_the_war_economy_title:0 "The War Economy"
 gor_burad_the_war_economy_desc:0 "For years, the artificers have been designing trinkets and curiosities that rarely amount to anything. Instead, let us put them firmly under the control of the Steam Barons, who boldly claim that they can put the artificers to work to vastly strengthen our military if we do."
 gor_burad_the_war_economy_tt:0 "This will increase our §YSteam Industry§! gain by 50%."

 gor_burad_a_trial_run_title:0 "A Trial Run"
 gor_burad_a_trial_run_desc:0 "Arg-Ôrdstun suffered for its inhabitant's past sins. Ovdal Lodhum will suffer for the sake of progress... and were chosen for turning their backs on the Gor Bûrad of old. We will undertake a more controlled flooding of the Hold, to see whether it can be replicated without causing significant damage to the hold."

 gor_burad_widening_the_river_title:0 "Widening the River"
 gor_burad_widening_the_river_desc:0 "For decades, the Lava River has had its name. However, it's not a true river... not yet, at least. Let us truly rip out the rails of old and widen the tunnels, so that the Lava River can become a river in truth, flowing freely full of molten rock!"

 # Mission events
 flavour_gor_burad.1.t:0 "Basalt Byproducts"
 flavour_gor_burad.1.d:0 "There are many constants in dwarvish life. This could be grudges, drunkenness, or a propensity for building. However, there is nothing as universal as the desire to dig. \nAs a result of our relative isolation, we have expanded our hold almost every which way, leading to many mining byproducts. While usually, this is useless silt, unsuitable to use even for the least strenuous building, due to our proximity to massive magma veins, we have found ourselves in possession of plentiful basalt reserves. To our surprise, they have served as perfect building blocks for our growing hold! This will allow us to construct buildings cheaply and quickly. A great trade deal!"
 flavour_gor_burad.1.a:0 "Make it our primary industry!"
 flavour_gor_burad.1.b:0 "Our current industry is too important."

 flavour_gor_burad.2.t:0 "Lava Rising"
 flavour_gor_burad.2.d:0 "Caverns roar a creaking sigh followed by a searing silence. Within the quiet, a handful of miners stop to gaze down and see the new opening beneath their boots - a cavity; its walls a mix of volcanic glass and minerals but as black as a polished obsidian mirror. The discovery of such a thing is not what scared these dwarves nor did the thought of them nearly falling down, it was that this chasm seemed to endlessly go deeper and deeper - deeper than any dwarf has ever dug before.\nYet the very end of this infinite downward tunnel had a dim light of orange hue and faint bubbling could be heard if no breath was inhaled.\n\nLike the Hoardcurse devours those obsessed with gold, we may have dug too deep to release something much worse…"
 flavour_gor_burad.2.a:0 "Not great!"

 flavour_gor_burad.3.t:0 "A Lovely Situation"
 flavour_gor_burad.3.d:0 "Borders, already malleable, are especially flexible in the Dwarovar. The expansive caves and caverns give little delineation between what may be controlled by one hold and what may be controlled by another. This has only been exacerbated by the foolhardy and deceitful Garnet Dwarves. As a convoy of our brave reclaimers descended into a totally uninhabited cavern, according to our maps from the archives of Gor Bûrad, a Garnet guardsman confronted them, claiming that it "wasn't their land" and that "There were dwarves already there." Clearly, this was but a ploy by the perfidious Garnet dwarves to stop our advancement! As is any right of a Basalt dwarf within our own lands, the leader of the reclaimers promptly killed him. Now, they are claiming that they are the victims and demand the head of the leader of the colonists. We must not let this affront to our honor go unpunished!"

It is unmistakably the source of the rage affecting every one of us but, it being dead, the rage it instils is almost certainly less than what it could be.\nWe have come up with plans to frame the cadaver in a machine that would, without going into too much detail, utilise liquid hot magma throughout its whole body to imitate living functions and detain the body in a state of unliving-undeath. This would allow us to, hypothetically, augment the effects of its rage on command.\nThere may be some unintended side-raging that occurs while we are building the Reactor and still adjusting the flow.

What used to be the joy of the people, our big old Vîlngan, is now desecrated and brought into unlife. The Reactor in its chest guides the flow of the lava through the whole length of the upper body, gathers it at the heart before guiding it out through the feet. The intense heat of the molten rock and metal resonates with the long sleeping corpse and has woken it up. The Fire Giant's gaze, once vacant in death, now seems almost pained. It bares its teeth behind its desiccated flesh. Its limbs are framed and restrained within the greater yoke of supports around The Reactor. Its muscles flex beneath its black, dried skin. Yet,the Fire Giant is still unable to sustain the heat and without the machine embedded within, it would again die.\n\n The escort continues speaking, "If we give the signal, the Core of the Reactor will start and add to the circulation of lava. The addition is what allows us to strengthen the rage."\nThe Baron then gives the signal and a monotone rhythm soon starts. Ba, Dum. Ba, dum. The lava does indeed move faster now and [Root.Monarch.GetName] can feel some dark emotion burn hotly within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].

The opening ceremony was magnificent as Steam Barons made sure that everyone attended and those who didn't wished they could.

 gor_burad_borborduz_tt:0 "This will be the third time in a row that we have declined Borbordûz. If we do so, we will lose the morale bonus from the §RBasalt Rage§! until we prevail in a Borbordûz duel."

 flavour_gor_burad.71.d:0 "Our great [Root.GovernmentName] has received one of the stranger Borbordûz challenges we've seen. A veteran, whether for glory, gold, or to settle a perceived slight by the state, has challenged us to duel above the magma and miasma. It is easily known that he is a veteran: his war-weary eyes, slightly singed beard, and most importantly, his lack of an arm. Clearly, his bluff and bluster covers up his inability in combat, despite his experience. Shall we not even acknowledge his pitiful challenge, or should we dispatch this fool once and for all?"
 flavour_gor_burad.72.d:0 "It is an inherent fact that, when some win economically, there must be a loser. Today, we have found a sad, sour variety of those losers has challenged us to a Borbordûz. Whether it is due to too much mercantilism or too little (it is truly impossible to tell with these types), she has found it fit to challenge us to a sacred duel. His merchant occupation can be easily deduced. She holds herself with the misplaced confidence and layer of fat only a marketer could muster. In addition to this, she is unfamiliar with combat, her weapon laying unsteady and awkward in her grasp. Shall we put her back in his place, or not even dignify her with a response?"
 flavour_gor_burad.73.d:0 "Government must work like a finely-oiled machine. No cogs nor cranks must be rusty if the ship of state is to sail smoothly. However, these regular repairs sometimes leave bureaucrats left with a sense of unjustified victimhood. One of these fired minor functionaries has come to us to challenge us to a Borbordûz, a sacred ritual of endurance above magma. In what is overall a depressing display, they have stated that they will win back their job or die trying. Despite the oddly saddening commentary on the mental state of our civil servants, we must decide all the same. Shall we accept their challenge, or remind them of their lost use to [Root.GovernmentName]?"
 flavour_gor_burad.74.d:0 "Our [Root.GovernmentName] has received yet another Borbordûz request. However, this is different from all others. In a sobering encounter, a retired general of our service has approached us, demanding a Borbordûz. He cites mass incompetence, a betrayal of Basalt standards, and timidness in policy. It will be no pleasure, nor no cakewalk to dispatch him if we choose to. He has many years of combat experience, he holds his weapon steady and sure. Not only that, he has the backing of influential officials in our military, whether openly or not. Shall we refuse his request, and accept the dishonor it would bring, or do we remind him why he is retired?"
 flavour_gor_burad.75.d:0 "The Basalt propensity for conflict is well known in the Dwarovar, if not all over Halann. This is reflected in almost all sectors of our society, whether it be our cutthroat merchants, merciless soldiers, or our cold and calculating officials. However, with this conflict, we will also find conflict within our own regime. In a strangely ironic display of our propensity for conflict turning in on ourselves., one of our statesmen have declared themselves incensed with the "cowardly and wimpy policies of our stupid idiot ruler." In addition to this artless declaration, they have challenged us to a Borbordûz. While we will always be fighting for the protection and advancement of Basalt interests, sometimes, so-called "diplomacy" and "truces" must be honored. While this official has made their living in statecraft, they are still to be feared as a warrior, as any Basalt dwarf should, with their warcraft practiced and perfected over long, hard years. Shall we avoid this challenge from this fairly well-known official, and live with the disgrace it brings, or do we bring an end to this horrid infighting in our state, and instead redirect it towards our enemies?"
 flavour_gor_burad.76.d:0 "Faith is important to any dwarf. Whether it be our old gods that allowed us to reach such monumental heights, or our ancestors that got us through our horrific banishment aboveground, we have found solace and success in our faith. However, sometimes this same intense faith that allows us unity in trying times can sometimes lead us to fragmentation and fracture, like glass under pressure. This has been especially exemplified in our latest Borbordûz challenge, in which one of our priests has seen fit to descend into the magma arenas to "stop the decay of Basalt civilization due to perfidious namby-pambies in our government." While one would expect a big-whig priest in most lands to be a cakewalk, the martial tradition of Gor Bûrad has led to them becoming an acclaimed fighter herself, their strikes and swerves seemingly swift as the ancestors' spirits themselves. Shall we refuse her challenge and subject ourselves to the humiliation it will bring, or put an end to her squabbling and plotting?"

 flavour_gor_burad.80.t:0 "Borbordûz!"
 flavour_gor_burad.80.d:0 "The magma boils. The weapons have been sharpened. The choking fumes of the magma chamber await the challengers. Basalt citizens, whether they be Steam Barons or average artisans, await the spectacle of the Borbordûz. Our ruler, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, sits in the seat of honor, beholding the great chaos of the magma and the voices of the audience. Finally, they hold up their hand, motioning for silence. Almost immediately, the usually impossible to control crowds of the Borbordûz fall silent. It is time to reveal our champion, our representative in the arena of magma and smoke. The only question is: Who shall it be?"
