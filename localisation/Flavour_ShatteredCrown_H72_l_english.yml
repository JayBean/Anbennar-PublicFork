H72_outlive_siegebreaker_desc:0 "Word travels slow through the fractured Dwarovar, but it travels nontheless. Rumors have it that shortly after Korgus, the false prophet who blamed the humans for the sins of the dwarves, left for the surface, he sent a clan back into the dwarovar to gather reinforcements: The Siegebreaker clan. If the rumors are to be believed thousands of Black Orcs are answering the call, following the clans claim that Korgus has been enjoying initial success in his invasion of Escann.

H72_attract_escanni_refugees_title:0 "Attract Escanni Settlers"
H72_attract_escanni_refugees_desc:0 "Khugdihr is a hold devoid of orc or goblins to rule over, if we wish to make it a true boon to our realm, we should seek to repopulate these dwarven halls with those we can demand tribute from. Let us send word to the surface to see if Escann has any willing ones."

H72_legacy_of_korgus_desc:0 "When the Siegebreaker clan spread word through the Dwarovar that Korgus was winning but needed more men, we thought they might have been telling the truth. Now that we have established contact with the surface, it is clear that is not the case: He died to a human woman named Corin and his armies fractured back into clans who now fight one another as much as they fight the humans. Korgus has fallen, perhaps we can pick up the pieces."

They have been arguing for weeks now, interpreting old wall painting, dwarven murals about their ancient war against us and oral traditions from the various clans we have subjugated. Opinions differ wildly, some shamans say we must bring the fight to the dwarven adventurers, others say we must wait for a sign whilst others say we must expediate our search for Dookan and free him. \n\n All agree that we should hear out all Black Orc shamans we can find and secure safe access to holy sites in Verkal Vazkron and the Hall of the Ancestors.

H72_mountainsharks_title:0 "Mountainsharks"
H72_mountainsharks_desc:0 "Mithradhûm stands in our oral traditions as a hold of immense wealth.

If we are to reach Hul-Jorkad we must deal with these goblins."

#Events

shatteredcrown.1.t:0 "Siegebreaker Heretics"
shatteredcrown.1.d:0 "As our clans have established contact, [H80.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Siegebreaker has been sending shamans to our people calling us upon our dookan-given duty to fight the humans and their gods, who they hold accountable for Dookan being imprisoned. As they preach in the streets about the imminent victory of Korgus in Escann and his need for reinforcements from the faithful, many keep walking, but some do stand and listen. Such heretical thoughts largely fall on deaf ears in our society: We all know only the dwarves are responsible for His imprisonment. As [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] orders the shamans to leave the realm a small but not insignificant amount of orcs follow them. Heretics who believe that Korgus is the son of Dookan. Even worse: Some of our most prominent clan elders are leaving for Escann as well!"
shatteredcrown.1.a:0 "We must put an end to these heretical Siegebreakers before our clan shatters!"

shatteredcrown.4.t:0 "The Shaman Conclave"
shatteredcrown.4.d:0 "There haven't been this many shamans gathered together in our realm is a very long time. The return of the dwarves has stirred up even the oldest of our professions. They gathered to discuss findings, visions, omens, ancient dwarven murals, old orc wallpaintings and discrepancies in the oral traditions of the various clans. \n\n The conclave took three whole days, but in the end the majority of the shamans came to the same conclusion: The answer to how Dookan is freed and how the dwarves can be defeated does not lie in Amldihr, it lies in Hul-Jorkad. The place where our history begins, the place where the ancients told stories of meeting Dookan himself. Deep down in that hold, we must go."
shatteredcrown.4.a:0 "We must return from where we came."
shatteredcrown.5.t:0 "Goblin Maps"
shatteredcrown.5.d:0 "As the goblins of the Dwarovrod adjust to our rule, they quickly figure out how to make themselves useful.

shatteredcrown.5.a:0 "Perhaps goblins aren't so bad"
shatteredcrown.6.t:0 "Zealous Settlers"
shatteredcrown.6.d:0 "As our government begins funding colonisation efforts towards Hul-Jorkad, we have found aid from a small faction of zealous orcs. They call themselves the Kar-Ankash, meaning Black Chosen. They believe the search for Dookan has been neglected for far too long and our occupation of the dwarven capital is an good way to contribute to keeping the dwarves out but far from enough to consider our Dookansearch fulfilled. They say they wish to aid our quest to Hul-Jorkad. Their men send their families to the colonies as they spend their savings on military equipment and offer to join the growing military.

shatteredcrown.9.d:0 "As the first level of Hul-Jorkad is made safe for our shamans, they begin the second large shaman conclave of this age. It ends up lasting only a couple of days as they explore the first level of the hold. When their findings reach [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is shocked by the conclusion: \n\n In order to complete our Dookansearch, we shall need to pour all our efforts into exploring Hul-Jorkad, to this end our government shall need to be reformed and focused on repairing Hul-Jorkad and gaining access to the second level. \n\n To ensure this goes well the hold is going to need to become the seat of government, it will also need a sizeable company of experienced diggers and its surroundings need to secured so it can not be threatened by other states."
shatteredcrown.9.a:0 "This Dookansearch is going to be costly..."
shatteredcrown.10.t:0 "Fate Of The Mossmouth Ogres"
shatteredcrown.10.d:0 "As the swampy hills around Amldihr get more closely economically tied to Amldihr, so do its people. The ogres have seen the armor and weaponry we forged with dwarven foundries and wish for jobs in our realm so they may also afford such things. What do we do with this?"
shatteredcrown.10.a:0 "They may serve in the military"
shatteredcrown.10.b:0 "They may work in the mines"
shatteredcrown.10.c:0 "They are welcome in both the military and the mines"
shatteredcrown.10.e:0 "They will be purged, ogres are nothing but trouble."

Hundreds of these are now reaching adulthood and have experienced trouble finding employment due to discrimination from both their parent races. With nowhere else to go, they are now starting to form into warbands, ready for hire."

shatteredcrown.12.d:0 "An emisary of the Shattered Crown clan has delivered a letter.

Our realm is clearly the strongest, and as such should take command in such a union. Will you join us in securing a future for all orcs, or will you remain isolated and unprotected?

The shamans have looked at it for many days, discussing every detail and speculating about its age, whilst also trying to interpret the more damaged parts of the carvings. They conclude to [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] that the drawing does indeed show the conquest of Hul-Jorkad, our earliest piece of known history. There are some peculiar details though, one of which is that the orc army seems to be pouring in from below and not from one of the two gates from the first level.

Days go by, but eventually they conclude several things after studying more newfound relics of the past that were found, along with conclusion drawn from more contemporary sources, such as dwarven prisoners from previous wars and dwarven documents found in the holds we took. \n\n The first conclusion is that we must dig further down in Hul-Jorkad, so the shamans may find what lies below. \n\n The second conclusion is that we must seek out the hold of Dúr-Vazhatun because a group of dwarven prisoners from the Blueshield Company admit to being ordered to search the hold for information about the origin of orcs. Rumor within the group has it they were doing experiments on orcs before the hold fell. \n\n The last conclusion is that we should seek out one of the few holds that orcs nor goblins have taken, a so called remnant-hold. Such a hold would no doubt have kept records on us, which might illuminate where they took Dookan to. To this end the shamans urge [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to seek out Ovdal Lodhum or Arg-Ôrdstun, both of which reside along the Argrod, which intersects the Gorrod near Hul-Jorkad.

The central access shaft is the first to made operational so useless pieces of rock can be repurposed for construction projects back on the first layer.

Some however deviate slightly from our origin story. \n\n Where our shamans tell us that our story simply begins in Hul-Jorkad, without any notion on what our history before that might have been, three minor clans amongst the green orcs claim that we were created there by dookan himself. Could Hul-Jorkad really be the cradle of our race, and not just where our shamans stopped remembering and retelling old stories?

Most of their ancient history is the same as ours, but among an almost extinct minor clan, the Axemaul clan, is where an interesting deviation lies: They claim that Dookan presented himself in physical form to a select few orcs in Hul-Jorkad, during the conquest of the hold. His avatar is said to be tall and slender, with pale skin like a Gray Orc. After the shamans discussed this story for days, they came to the conclusion that it is worthy of inclusion into the Tugund-Oraz, but not all believe it.

The rest of their stories and oral traditions are backed up by various stories from black orc clans we've met along the way on our conquest through the serpentspine, so they seem credible.

Not the ones from the Deepwoods or those of Bulwar, a clan of elves long gone now. A book tells about how right when the dwarves thought they were going to win the war, us orcs showed up in Hul-Jorkad and pushed the empire over the edge, fracturing it into individual holds and cutting Ovdal Ludhum off from communicating beyond the Gorrod.

However, most information here about those events seem to be based on the same sources as those from Ovdal Ludhum, or even entirely based upon those books. One book is of peculiar interest though, a book borrowed from the Seghdihr library. It speaks of the seventh level of Hul-Jorkad, which was apparently used as a prison by the dwarven empire during the war, which housed elf commanders, entire elf regiments and even ogres and goblins who aided the elves in their war.

They described thousands of monsters breaking out of the prison on the seventh floor and flooding the hold, the description they give of the monsters clearly indicates they speak of our ancestors. They did not say much more, just to fortify the gate northern gate and that they're heading to Grônstunad to report to the secondary capital, refusing to disclose classified information about Hul-Jorkad to the local governor of Seghdihr, to his frustration.

It reads: \n\n It hadn't been a week since we had heard that the elves had been beaten near Amldihr, when that very army led by the wretched elf mage Ducaniel sieged our Hul-Jorkad. Me and my men held the gates for months, but eventually they were penetrated. Me and my unit of guards laid low for a while, after which we started sabotaging the elven occupation. The inhabitants of the hold were forced by the elves to repair the gates and deface our own temples. Information from outside the hold was restricted to a maximum, but eventually us in the resistance realised the elves themselves were now under siege by a dwarven army. Our salvation was right outside the gates, they just needed to be opened! As the resistance made contact with the dwarven army outside, we planned and executed an attack together, succesfully opening the northern gate and liberating the first level. The elves fled to the second level and barricaded the shaft, starting a new siege. We fought our way down Hul-Jorkads levels, one by one. We knew it was only a matter of time when we retook layer four, which was their primary source of food. When we had eventually pushed the elven invaders down into the seventh layer, we readied ourselves for a final battle. As the elite dwarves in the front broke through their defenses and started flooding the temple layer, me and my men followed as well. We saw initial successes, but as we established a foothold on the layer, a huge surge of magic could be felt through the air, followed by shouts of pure rage. We thought it was a counterattack from the elves, but what came out of the alleyways weren't elves, but an endless horde of what the men have taken to calling orcs. They burst out of the temples and alleys, some naked and without weapon, others with weapons of dwarven or elven make. They just kept pouring out, it all happened so fast, even the strongest dwarves could not withstand such a wave of muscle and steel. When me and my men saw the hold was lost, we stopped looking and started running, we fled back up to the first floor, those horrific beasts in pursuit. \n\n Luckily we made it out alive and together with some other citizens caught the last train to Seghdihr, one which wont ride to Hul-Jorkad in a while, I think. I am writing this report on that very train and hope we manage to bring it to Grônstunad safely, if not and you find this message, please bring it to the Grônstunad so they can send reinforcements. -Grimmar Shalebeard, Former Captain of the Guards in Hul-Jorkad."

The shamans hastily order the men to keep digging, as they attempt to secure these relics of the past, which may have been the first orcish battle to have ever been fought and as such, a terrific holy site. The smiths of the hold say that the Mithril forge will need significant investments to get working again, as the massive chimney for the furnace that has been running along the side of the holds levels has been deconstucted or repurposed on the higher levels.

As the days go by more and more ancient weaponry and armour is lifted from the shaft, the shaft seems be almost entirely filled with the remains of a battle, our first battle? \n\n Days later, orcs step foot on the seventh layer for what must be over seven and a half thousand years according to dwarven records. Shamans begin rushing down the shaft and over the rubble, climbing over fallen pillars, pushing one another aside in a frenzy to reach Dookan. Across the hold they find what might be the oldest orcs ever, pertrified orcs with weaponry and armor unknown to the shamans, turned to stone by what must have been dwarven mages. The shamans try unepetrifying one with a ritual but he turns to ash. Among the group of stone orcs they see men and women, but no children. After searching for hours they pick up on a trace of magical energy in the damp air which they end up following to a dwarven temple. They enter into the building and as the horde of shamans, black, green, gray and brown make their way closer to the source of the magic, even the least gifted shaman can feel it, this source is incredibly potent. The thousands of shamans begin exploring the temple, which appears to have been defaced thoroughly. Ancient dwarven deities have had their statues toppled, murals are carved to a state of chaos. As the crowd slowly makes it to the back of the temple, they find an area emanating so much raw magic it makes some shamans sick, others cry. This... This must be Dookans doing \n\n The shamans take turns observing the area from a distance, none dare step into it. They identify a circle of chalk on the floor used in some spell foreign to them, writing on the wall in a language they do not understand and magic in the air they can not identify. along the circle lay thousands of urns, their contents long gone.

They all agree on certain parts: Seven and a half thousand years ago the dwarves were waging a fierce war against a faction of elves, who almost captured the dwarven capital in Amldihr but were pushed back and one of their mage generals, Ducaniel, and his armies retreated to Hul-Jorkad, they held the hold for what could have been years, their armies slowly suffering due to rebellions of the dwarves inside, being sieged from the tunnels and elves fleeing into Bulwar. Eventually the gates fell and Ducaniel and his regiments retreated deeper into the hold. This process continued until they were crammed into the seventh level of Hul-Jorkad, having lost their access to the farms on the 4th, Ducaniel began preparing a spell, which can be seen in the temple. From that level orcs have either spawned or erupted in large numbers and overtaken the hold. \n\n That is where the opinions begin to differ. As days of arguing turn into weeks, they still cannot decide if Dookan spawned them, they dug in, they were teleported in or they were already a part of Ducaniels army. The Brown Orc shamans have perhaps the most divergent belief. They claim that the elf mage-general Ducaniel is in fact Dookan, and he cast a spell to create the orcs, ascending to godhood right in that temple. They cite their similar names, the fact that orcs have no history prior to this hold's level and the fact they have been calling him Dookanil all this time as insurmountable evidence of these facts. They differ on the opinion whether Dookan is still alive, or whether the magic in the air is all of him that's left. As the weeks go by more and more clan-shamans join their side, until the realm is split in two: Those who accept the notion that Ducaniel is in fact Dookan, an elf-turned-god, who has since abandoned the orcs but has blessed them with life and purpose. And those who reject that notion: Dookan was not an elf but a god, Ducaniel may have been his avatar, assuming the shape of an elf and using the elves to create a homeland free of dwarves for the orcs, spawning the orcish race in from this hold. He was however captured by dwarven gods and orcs must free him by killing dwarves and desecrating their temples until their gods are dead and Dookan is freed. \n\n The two factions fail to reconcile their differences and the conclave ends without conclusion. A feeling of uneasiness falls over [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], who now sees the shamans beginning to divide the realm, instead of unifying it.

shatteredcrown.49.d:0 "As more and more communities in the north embrace the new teachings of Bulgu Orazan, conflicts begin to arise in the north. As holds are far too large to have only a single shaman, hundreds of shamans have all been proselytising in their respective holds. \n\nAs such the holds have become fighting grounds for the new religious schism which now fractures the realm. As rhetoric becomes more toxic, violence is brought to the streets: Temples are desecrated, shamans murdered and families get forced to swear off the oppossing faith by local militias. In various holds the Bulgu Orazan community is now larger than the Old Dookan one, as threats of violence force them to accept the new doctrine and militias remove statues and scriptures which depict or discuss Dookan."

shatteredcrown.50.d:0 "As [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has still been unwilling to comment on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal views on the tale of Dookan, some of the most radical Kar-Ankash shamans in Hul-Jorkad have declared the royal family to be Bulgu Orazan heretics. They have riled up the a portion of the locals and they have stormed the royal palace in Hul-Jorkad. As royal guards and Old Dookan fanatics clash, [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] prepares for the worst. As fighting in the streets of Hul-Jorkad worsen even further and bodies begin to pile up in the streets, it seems clear that the monarchy is no longer welcome here, or in any Old Dookan provinces for that matter. With the Old Dookan Kar-Ankash faction alienated, the family is forced to revoke their stance of neutrality and find allies on the other side of the realm: The Bulgu Orazan communities of the north. As the court shaman starts a contingency protocol and begins preparing an expensive teleportation spell to a hold outside of the influence of the Kar-Ankash shaman faction, he asks to which hold [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] would like to go..."

They have set up a council of shamans and are continuing to consolidate local power. As generals still loyal to the administration try to maintain their tenuous grasp on Hul-Jorkad, shamans urge soldiers to reject the monarchy and counter any influence the monarchy has on the region. \n\nWith the monarchy and their administration in chaos due to their evacuation from Hul-Jorkad, the Kar-Ankash faction takes their chance: They declare the monarchy unfit and declare an independent theocratic council, gaining much support from the southern Old Dookan provinces."
