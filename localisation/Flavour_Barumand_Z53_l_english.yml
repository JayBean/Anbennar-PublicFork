 barumand_smiths_of_tamashrug_title:0 "Smiths of Tamashrug"
 barumand_smiths_of_tamashrug_desc:0 "What the Humans call 'Vernham' is quite valuable, having been home to many smiths and armouries before our brothers sacked it. We must repair the local facilities to pump out iron and blades for the armies of Barumand.\n\nThankfully our increased cooperation and integration of the Humans has allowed us to repair and improve on the local goods, and with Orcish strength the smiths of Tamashrug forge again." 

 barumand_sharpen_blade_title:0 "Sharpening the Blade"
 barumand_sharpen_blade_desc:0 "If we wish to liberate the people of Escann from the tyrannical lords of Cannor and fear of hunger, we must first sharpen the more metaphorical blade of our armies. A well trained army shall serve us well, equipped of course, with the literal sharpened blades that our brand new smiths provide"

 barumand_west_entrance_title:0 "The West Entrance"
 barumand_west_entrance_desc:0 "To our south lay the Deepwoods, a bane in any nation's backside. These lands are home to the Fey, and not much else is known to the inhabitants of this place, we are led to believe a contingent of Dookanson's followers ended up in this hell of mazes and leaves -- but nothing is known of their fate.\n\nWe shall build a gate in the Western Entrance, to block anyone going in, and especially block anything from coming out, for what lies in those woods may simply be waiting to strike at our farmlands."

 barumand_permanent_embassies_title:0 "Permanent Embassies"
 barumand_permanent_embassies_desc:0 "The establishment of permanent embassies in our subjects will help ensure smooth relations continue. The nobility will lead this effort, and we may have to win their support by some bribes of livestock, but it is a worthwhile investment for our future."

 barumand_tamashrug_university_title:0 "Tamashrug University"
 barumand_tamashrug_university_desc:0 "Tamashrug has grown into a fledgling city in its own right, and from the day we repaired its forges and plunged it into a future of steel and blade, we have prepared it for prosperity. However every orc needs more than just an axe and armour, and Tamashrug is home to some of the brightest orcs in our nation, thanks to the Smiths’ extensive training in steel-working.\n\n. However, as we learn more about the Cannorians and their diverse lands, we have come to find that the greatest minds of these lands are the gnomes, earliest users of Artificery and the inventors of many great devices, that our richest clamor to afford. Let us seek out a group of gnomes willing to assist our fledgling nation in the construction of a great place of education, the University of Tamashrug."

 barumand_their_fruit_title:0 "Their Fruit"
 barumand_their_fruit_desc:0 "The trade and goods that flow through Eastern Cannor are generally quite appealing to the average Barumandi Orc -- because, after all, with all the food coming from our verdant fields, the Kruman can focus on luxury goods. Of course, with a little investment of money and influence, we should be able to take this trade to new heights."

 barumand_long_march_title:0 "The Long March"
 barumand_long_march_desc:0 "The lands in the east will be tough to conquer: they back onto the Serpentspine mountains and are covered in forests, making any war a slog. Our soldiers face a long march ahead, but they must persist, for we must prepare the state for the liberation of all Escann!"

 barumand_below_the_wall_title:0 "Push Below the Wall"
 barumand_below_the_wall_desc:0 "With the lands in the east of south Castanor safely in our grasp, we should secure the lands below the white walls, any possible invasion from the north and secure the gold mines near the foothills of the West Dwarovar.\n\nBut it is not enough to guard these lands, when we can ensure they prosper, restoring the damage done by the Greentide and all the adventurers that came after."

 barumand_steady_state_title:0 "The Resolute State"
 barumand_steady_state_desc:0 "After many years of conquest and rebuilding we have finally established ourselves as the hegemon of Eastern Cannor. We have risen to a position none thought orcs ever could, and as such we can push forward into the future with our power base secure.\n\nOur next step is to determine what is to be done with the rowdy and warmongering north: if we continue our path of retribution and grain output, they might end their conflicts, but the future is a mystery to all those who watch."

 barumand_strong_alliances_title:0 "Strong Alliances"
 barumand_strong_alliances_desc:0 "If we are to continue our steady existence in this modern age, we must secure alliances, strong ones we can rely on for centuries to come. Let us reach out to see who might support us."

 barumand_let_us_in_title:0 "They Let Us in"
 barumand_let_us_in_desc:0 "Despite how humiliating the first Landsmeet of Barumand was, the few who did stay were interested in our proposals. The path forward is clear: a managed tribute system, where we provide protection, and they ensure steady access to a specific piece of their market.\n\nWhilst this may seem like mere plays for influence, we are merely trying to protect the Escanni people, and if we must put our men in the court of every kingdom in Escann to do so, we will do just that. But it is in our best interest that we do these things diplomatically, so let us propose this system to the neighbouring Escannis and figure out what to do with the rest later."

 barumand_show_kindness_title:0 "Showing Kindness"
 barumand_show_kindness_desc:0 "If we are to show Escann that we are well meaning, we must display our diplomacy by rewarding the subjects we have acquired. We shall do this by subsidising their grain production so that even in the harshest winter, not a soul will starve."

 barumand_our_labour_title:0 "Our Labour"
 barumand_our_labour_desc:0 "Grain! Grain! GRAIN! Our labour is the peak of agriculture: every Orcish landowner wakes to farm, for the country, for their families and for the future of Eastern Cannor.\n\nAt least that's what our criers tell, but in truth, as advanced as our agricultural centres are, we still have to up production if we are to feed all the people of Eastern Cannor. Thankfully with government investments and the support of our farmers, upping production to new leaps should be simple."

 barumand_taller_taller_title:0 "Build Them Taller"
 barumand_taller_taller_desc:0 "As our grain production and demand rises, we require larger, no, TALLER storage. Some may call this unplanned, and unsafe, but our top engineers assure us that the "WAAAAGH" in these silos is strong enough to support our increasing population, and to keep these containers from collapsing."

 barumand_grain_lord_title:0 "Lords of Grain"
 barumand_grain_lord_desc:0 "Over the years, our farmers, researchers, mages and advisors have spent large amounts of time and effort to perfect the production of grain. Our bread and wheat flows into Cannor, and  'Made in Barumand' has even become a selling point: people flock to markets in hopes of tasting our fulfilling and perfected grain.\n\nSome have even started to dub our farmers and [Ruler.GetTitle] the Grain Lords, and this title is certainly befitting of the largest producers of Grain in Cannor, producing more than even the halflings of the Small Country."

 barumand_south_wall_title:0 "Southern Wall"
 barumand_south_wall_desc:0 "To our south lay an unbreakable wall known as the Godshield. We have based one of our grain silos against this range of mountains as it allows us to place construction supports along it.\n\nNow, we have begun work on a Hold of Grain -- no dwarves involved. After all, this is not some dingy cavern system, but  a huge grain silo that scales the mountains near Shieldrest. And if we add some defenses to our constructions, we'll ensure the silo never falls."

 barumand_willing_army_title:0 "Army of the Willing"
 barumand_willing_army_desc:0 "If we are to show Escann our willingness to change, we must first show that our armies are not a horde of  Green Orcs fighting for loot and plunder, but instead noble soldiers who fight for the freedom of their lands and their people. May our army of the willing soon grant liberation to South Castanor."

 barumand_fields_forests_title:0 "Fields and Forests"
 barumand_fields_forests_desc:0 "The toughest terrain in South Castanor is the forests in the west, but in the face of our army, they shall fall soon enough. And soon after that, it is time to prepare them for prosperity: chop the forests, bring in humans and nobles to prove we are no monsters, and ready the fields for farming."

 barumand_develop_agriculture_title:0 "Develop Agriculture"
 barumand_develop_agriculture_desc:0 "Before, we learned what little we knew of farming from the skeletons of ruined farmsteads, the sagging ditches of dessicated irrigation systems, and the mangled fences of abandoned pastures. Now we learn firsthand from the humans who have come to know us as more than monsters.\n\nWe learn the intricacies of crop rotations, the trick of angling barns to the wind, the layering of straw to keep livestock warm in the winter, and many more things large and small that humanity picked up through millennia of cultivation. With this knowledge we will rebuild the farms, redig the ditches, and repair the fences; with this we will bring about a new way of farming, the orcish way."

 barumand_east_entrance_title:0 "The East Entrance"
 barumand_east_entrance_desc:0 "The new farmlands we have cultivated must be defended. While the Army of the Willing keeps our harvests safe from the threats of Escann there are elusive foes to our south: foes with fey influence and fell aims, against whom we must prepare a stronger vigilance.\n\nWe must add fortifications, watch towers, patrols, and signal fires to the Eastern Entrance, such that no southern foe shall approach without our knowing, and no foe at all shall pierce its gates!"

 barumand_peace_mind_title:0 "Peace In Mind"
 barumand_peace_mind_desc:0 "Prior to building a new Capital, or vast farms, or solid fortifications, we chose to build a new self. Now that all of South Castanor lies safely in the control of our new orcish state, and the Rage of our people has subsided, we can finally declare our journey has come to its conclusion.\n\nThe new Barumandi orc harbors not a strength through rage, but a cool and calculated power. We are well-tempered and well-trained, as is proven both by the small everyday actions of our citizens, and the talented diplomacy of our State."

 barumand_landsmeet_title:0 "Escanni Landsmeet"
 barumand_landsmeet_desc:0 "We have finally established ourselves in South Castanor, and with a state as solid as ours, we are ready to enter an age of prosperity. Our diplomats suggest a new path forward, that could lead to absolute diplomatic dominance in Eastern Cannor: a system of marginally autonomous states known as Kruman.\n\nWe shall invite all of the petty kings of Escann to our capital for a glorious party at which we will announce our plans. If all goes well, they will agree and the interfighting in our great homeland will stop. Right?"

 barumand_into_our_cause_title:0 "Into Our Cause"
 barumand_into_our_cause_desc:0 "The Kruman system has allowed us to extend our influence over all of Escann and has shown its people they can place their faith in us without worry. As such, the time has come for a second Landsmeet.\n\nThe first may have failed to join our purposes with the other Escanni, but next to the calculations and preparations we have put together, not to mention the extent of new resources we have available for this attempt, the first landsmeet will soon look like a village market. In this greatly improved Landsmeet the cause of Barumand will be united with Kruman and Tributary, for the prosperity of all Escann."

 barumand_outer_grainaries_title:0 "Outer Granaries"
 barumand_outer_grainaries_desc:0 "While the site at Mereham is now complete, it is now clear that no matter how tall we build the Silo it will not be large enough. Two more sites, one in Shieldrest to the south, and the other in Westgate to the North, will make sure every corner of our state is protected from famine, and able to benefit from our grandest constructions."

 barumand_escann_liberated_title:0 "Escann's Liberator"
 barumand_escann_liberated_desc:0 "It is done.\n\nBarumand has defended Escann from invaders, and unified her people under our influence. For the first time in centuries, Escann is now finally able to stand united, a bulwark of Corinite worship and prosperity that the rest of the world gazes on with envy."

 barumand_power_gates_title:0 "Gates Upon Power"
 barumand_power_gates_desc:0 "Southgate and Westgate are the primary ways through the walls of Castanor, and thereby the gates to all of Inner Castanor. Both gates are not what they once were, but with Escann now under the righteous rule of us and our Kruman we have the resources to reconstruct them.\n\nThese new gates to the centre of Escann, The Gates of Celebration and Emergency, will cement our hold on the region. Passing through them will be the joy of those loyal to Barumand, for they shall stand as monuments to our protection and prestige to all the peoples of Escann!"

 barumand_nuzrandu_title:0 "Nuzrandu"
 barumand_nuzrandu_desc:0 "Nuzrandu, Orcish for a vision of the future. It is a vision of Eastern Cannor in peace, fed and kept from the woes of wars.\n\nOur Kruman system so far has done wonders to keep the humans away from the bloodshed and devastation of war, but this autonomy could lead to rebellion, and rebellion would risk our new future.\n\nWe could continue as we have, and turn our gaze to South Castanor, while shielding our subjects from war. But instead, we could also fully integrate the Kruman, dissolving their sovereignty, perhaps exposing them to conflict, but making us a dominant force among the many growing powers of Halcann.\n\nWhat shall our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] choose to be the Nuzrandu of Barumand?"

 barumand_escann_blade_title:0 "Escann's Blade"
 barumand_escann_blade_desc:0 "The pre-greentide kingdoms of old grew lazy. Complacent. Weak. And they paid dearly for this folly. Barumand will not repeat their mistake.\n\nEven in times of peace, every Barumandi Orc keeps a blade or a barrel on him in case of unseen threat. Farmers gladly report for muster when they need to, as they understand that their prosperity only exists because of their will to defend it. This may seem strange to outsiders, but in Barumand, it is just a way of life.\n\nOutsiders have taken to calling us Escann's Blade. We see this as a great compliment, because if they see us as the sword defending Escann nobody would dare make us swing.\n\n"Invading Barumand is a difficult task, as you fight through every inch of land, you come across a bush, and behind every bush, is an Orc with a freshly sharpened blade, or newly polished barrel pointing at you." - Lain Silcalas, 1654, On the Peoples of a New Escann"

 barumand_change_within_title:0 "Change From Within"
 barumand_change_within_desc:0 "Outsiders may hate us no matter what we do, and that is why why we must show that we can change --  not outward, but inward to ourselves. Let the confidence of Barumand’s orcs grow as they each day see themselves becoming more honourable, more tolerant, and more kind.\n\nThe Escanni may not care that we try to change, but when we show them that we will change for the better whether they care or not, their eyes shall be forced to open!"

 barumand_orc_capital_title:0 "Capital of the Orcs"
 barumand_orc_capital_desc:0 "When we first invaded Escann, its lands were plundered under the armies of Dookanson. Now, the lands and cities we hold lay in ruin, devastated and depopulated. It is clear  we need a place to call our home, to establish our rule  over Eastern Castanor, and to protect the orcs that remain in Escann. The sites of Ionntras, Banesfork, and Vernham are but some of the places most suitable for a home of our own."

 barumand_better_farming_methods_title:0 "Better Farming Methods"
 barumand_better_farming_methods_desc:0 "The lands of South Castanor are fertile, and have provided us with more food than previous generations of our kind had even dreamed of. However, we barely knew the basics of farming, and only knew the corpses of farmers and their abandoned farmsteads. We grew closer to starvation each passing winter.\n\nIt is time for Barumund to learn from the humans from the rest of Cannor. We will learn their ways of farming so we can make better use of the rich lands we hold, and reconstruct the farmsteads destroyed during the Greentide."

 barumand_grain_state_title:0 "The Grain State"
 barumand_grain_state_desc:0 "As we become increasingly dependent on agriculture, it becomes increasingly clear that one bad year of crops could ruin us. To prevent this, we shall build the largest grain silo in Cannor, to store the grain of good years to use in bad ones.\n\nA perfect site has been found, on the southern tip of Lake Silvermere. We should develop this area into a town, suitable enough  handle the logistical challenges of filling this store. "

 barumand_some_refuse_title:0 "But Some Refuse"
 barumand_some_refuse_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to show the other Escanni the many benefits of entwining their states to Baramund, some still refused. This is truly their loss, as they have left us with absolutely no choice but to bring them into the fold by using the ultimate tool of diplomacy: war."

 barumand_their_diplomacy_title:0 "Their Way of Diplomacy"
 barumand_their_diplomacy_desc:0 "One thing we orcs have learned since coming to the surface is the human love for gold. We have plenty of the stuff lying around,and by giving the Cannorians gold, we shall link them to ourselves."

 barumand_corin_duty_title:0 "Corin's Sworn Duty"
 barumand_corin_duty_desc:0 "Our duty, passed down to us from Corin, is to defend Escann. Just as she protected Escann from our ancestors before we called it home, we must now repel outsiders from the rest of Cannor who seek influence within Escann. Escann for the Escanni, Cannor for the Cannorians."

 barumand_adean_rest_title:0 "Laying Adean to Rest"
 barumand_adean_rest_desc:0 "Since the birth of the nation of Barumand, Corin has been one of the most important figures to our nation for all citizens, orc and human alike. Naturally, we support her claim as the rightful leader of the Regent Court, not the pretender Adean.\n\nAs our influence has spread throughout Escann, the other Escanni have come to agree with our stance. Adean has few followers left in Escann, and his claim has been put to rest.  "

 barumand_third_landsmeet_title:0 "The Third Landsmeet"
 barumand_third_landsmeet_desc:0 "The second Landsmeet aimed for peace in Escann by the removal of foreign invaders, and now with the efforts of us and our Kruman this dream of a lasting peace for all Escann has been realized.\n\nLet the summons cry out through the Corin-Blessed fields, hills, and forests: the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Baranthad, liberator of Escann, calls all Kruman to [Root.Capital.GetName] for the hosting of the third Landsmeet! Both to celebrate the peace we have achieved, and to present our new goals to our subjects. "

 barumand_escann_heart_title:0 "Escann's Heart"
 barumand_escann_heart_desc:0 "Castonath is Escann's stone heart, the thrum of the city echoing the beat of our own hearts. Unfortunately, the nearby silo is in need of massive renovations and improvements to support the city’s burgeoning population. Once this work is complete, the legendary city will become even more vibrant, and reach a new height of glory."

 barumand_smaller_beat_title:0 "Smaller Beats"
 barumand_smaller_beat_desc:0 "While Castonath is indubitably the heart of Escann, that does not mean we should ignore the rest of the land. The smaller heart beats of Eastern Cannor are just as important as Castonath.\n\nIonntras, Silvervord, Vernham and the other great cities we have built must also be tended to, and they will be made into the beating heart of their own regions. They will become centers for learning, manufacturing, and art to rival any other in Cannor, and many will move to our nation from across Cannor to be a part of our success."

 barumand_corins_teachings_title:0 "Corin's Teachings"
 barumand_corins_teachings_desc:0 "Pillage. Slaughter. Destruction. Glory.  These were the princapals that led our forefathers out of the Serpentspine.\n\nNow, as generation upon generation of Green Orcs grow up in Escann, our temperment has mellowed and turned their focus towards the long term. Arosha Oakbreaker, who served with Corin as part of her Circle against our ancestors in the Greentide, has become a key figure in helping move away from those traditions, passing Corin's teachings onto our young nation.\n\nShe stood tall with the burgeoning Barumandi state in its moment of weakness, and was a shining example of what orcs could become in this new green land. Aligning the state and clergy with her philosophies will help foster this shift to our new values and way of life.\n\nHonor, Tolerance, Diligence, and Bravery will be the values that every young Barumandi will strive for.  From Corin, to Arosha, to all Barumand."

 barumand_mending_relations_title:0 "Mending Past Relations"
 barumand_mending_relations_desc:0 "As we consolidated our state, we naturally stepped on the toes of the other new Escanni settlers, orc, human, or otherwise. Making common cause with these groups will show them that we have changed, and are no longer looking to foment violence in Escann, but will instead promote peace in our shared new home."

 barumand_fortify_the_borders_title:0 "So Fortify The Borders"
 barumand_fortify_the_borders_desc:0 "Corvuria. The one kingdom of Escann that was untouched by the Greentide. They remain strong, and what we heard from the Ravenmarchers we integrated long ago... troubles us.\n\nThey are the largest threat left near our heartland. We must establish a series of fortifications, while simultaneously sending ex-Ravenmarcher agents into Arca Corvur and Gablaine to discover any plots they may have against us."

 barumand_strike_them_down_title:0 "And Strike Them Down"
 barumand_strike_them_down_desc:0 "Our agents  quickly reported that the Corvurian nobility was preparing an attack against us. Thus, we will take it upon ourselves to strike them down first.\n\nRaven Banner was an adventuring company during the Greentide aftermath led by scions of the Sil Vivin family that was soon integrated into Barumand. One of their line married an orcish woman, and now that half-orc child has proven himself a capable young man. Putting him in charge of Corvuria will ensure that they never again challenge us. "

 flavour_barumand.1.d:0 "Arosha Oakbreaker was an Orc in Corin's party during her attempts to stop the Greentide. While some might call her a traitor, we cannot forsake her teachings, which she brought to us during our darkest hour. She trained our troops and spread the teachings of Corin, and we shall pay her due, upholding these teachings and showing tolerance to those different to us."
 flavour_barumand.1.a:0 "Corin taught Arosha, and she taught us."
 flavour_barumand.2.t:0 "Welcome Human Settlers?"
 flavour_barumand.2.d:0 "As the Army of the Willing advances across Escann, they cannot help but notice how empty it is. Fields lay fallow. Mills in disrepair. Mines remain dark.\n\nWhile orcs could be moved in to work these areas, [Root.Monarch.GetName] recently had an idea with much merit. Send the most diplomatic of our kind to the people of Western Cannor, asking them to come and settle lands we recently conquered from human adventurer bands, blending into their societies. This will help integrate us with greater Cannorian society, and their letters home will help convince the world that the Greentide is over, and Barumandi Orcs are turning over a new leaf."

 flavour_barumand.8.t:0 "Permanent Orcish Capital"
 flavour_barumand.8.d:0 "We have reconstructed the cities of Ionntras, Banesfork, and Vernham, as well as developed our current capital. Now we must consider a capital to protect Orcs for the coming centuries.\n\nOur first choice is Ionntras to the north, it is in a great position for establishing ourselves in Escann. Whilst no Castonath, its position near the local rivers and its proximity to the centre of Escann is priceless.\n\nThe second choice is Banesfork which lies along another set of local rivers, would be a good place to keep an eye on the Deepwoods and is a hub for trade in the region.\n\nAs for our final choice, we have Vernham which was a place for many of Escann's smiths and armouries. There, once we invite the smiths back into Vernham, it would allow us orcs to arm ourselves with much sharper and stronger steel.\n\nOr perhaps we'll build up [Root.Capital.GetName], where we have resided since the end of Rottenstep. It has served us well, and if need be, it will continue its service forevermore."

To make diplomacy with an orc made you seem just as brutish and monstrous as we did, but now we must change these beliefs. We have  sent out a formal invitation to the many humans of Eastern Cannor, calling them to a meeting of all the lands, a Landsmeet.\n\nHowever, there was trouble from the first course of the first feast. Only a few humans showed up, and about half of them were messengers with insults and depravities about the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and the rest had only sent ambassadors in their stead. While we can understand their caution in resposne to an orcish invitation,, have we not shown our generosity with our upkeep of the human lord's rights to their previous titles, the upkeep of human cities, and the suppression of our rage?\n\nWe shall send back these messengers with words of the Landsmeet's goals and how we intend to pursue them. Hopefully the lords of these lands will see it right to join our cause, and if not... We'll just have to use alternative means of diplomacy."

 flavour_barumand.11.d:0 "After perilous liberation and talks, the clergymen of our nation have come to the conclusion that Adean's influence in Escann has come to an end.

 flavour_barumand.12.d:0 "Convening in $CAPITAL$ was grand, for this time the Escanni were far more willing to join us in feast, having proven our growth and that they had nothing to worry about when doing diplomacy with us. With the first goal of the Landsmeet complete, we move onto the second: liberating the lands stolen by the outsiders in Cannor and the Dwarovar. The people who settled these lands after the Greentide hold the claim to these lands, and as such we shall uphold their claims, liberating core Escann land, and developing the land we hold already.\n\nOnce we have freed these lands, the Third Landsmeet can commence. There, we will unveil a great project for Escann, to give the humans their eternal peace and prosperity, and forge a new future for Escann."

Baranthad now rules over the once-broken lands, and from itss rest a new power will rise, with the support of the people.\n\nThe Baranthadi Orcs strove to bring peace to Escann and finally we have succeeded, and it is now time  to lay crops and foundations for the future generations, and build anew from what is ruined.  No longer will we starve, for the granaries are full; no longer will we cry in sorrow, for the wars are kept out of Krumani land; and all shall soon dream a new dream  for the future."

Of course we were quick to spread the news far and wide.\n\nThis was until humans reported that the fish was in fact, not new, but has  been fished in Lake Silvermere for millenia.

With exotic sugar, and new ingredients, we have devised a new recipe: frying pasta and coating it in sugar, you get a sweet dish that makes even the toughest orc look at you differently. We will promote its sale, so that humans, orcs, Elves and the like all can enjoy this tasty treat."

 flavour_barumand.16.d:0 "Here we are, at long last. The fruits of our labour, finally ripe. We have come a long way since our fledgling state, a state with ideals of peace and unity, despite its origins in sheer destruction.\n\nWhere once the lords and landowners merely sent dignitaries to insult us at our first Landsmeet, their descendents now stand within our halls, not to insult us, but to conduct business and diplomacy with us. This is a true monument to our success. \n\nAnd throughout our journey to bring orcs and men together as one, there was our Kruman, loyally standing by our side. They may not have helped in the bloody conflicts of our past, but they fuelled our state with cheap luxuries, propelling the standards of living for our people to new highs! The states around us become increasingly centralised and monarchs become absolute in their power and the threat these states pose to our decentralised state cannot be overstated. \n\nPrehaps it is time we integrate our Kruman directly into our state, so that we can better guarantee the safety of all our people. On the other hand, we could also reward their loyalty to our cause and respect their autonomy."

She has been seen visiting the countless cities we rebuilt and has found quite the love for orcish architecture.\n\nRecently she visited the seat of power in [Capital.GetName] and spoke with $MONARCH$, speaking at length about the philosophy of Corin's leadership of the Regent Court, as well as the personal beliefs of Corin. It seems we have found ourselves someone who reveres Corin just as much as we do."

There are several powerful humans who now wish to be granted the right to be a part of the government.\n\nThe humans may not appreciate their request being denied and we could risk losing all the progress that we have worked for. And yet, there are several who fear that their influence and ambition may lead us down a darker path than we desire..."

Mostly composed of old veterans of the early wars that founded our great nation and shamans still clinging to faith in Dookanson's mission, these agitators are a real danger to our new regime.\n\nWe may yet have to raise our weapons again, this time against our own war heroes, if our dream of prosperity is to survive."

Despite redirecting substantial resources to protective measures and deploying the army on several occasions to restore peace, we cannot be everywhere at once.\n\nWith farms burned and mob violence spreading, many humans consider our state to have failed in its duty to protect them and have taken matters into their own hands, arming themselves and forming "self-defence brigades" of questionable loyalty."

A future  free of the blood, misery, and hunger of the past.\n\nWe believed we had achieved that dream, proved those who viewed orcs as nothing but savages and barbarians wrong. Arosha Oakbreaker taught us that it is the struggle of every orc to quell the rage within himself, but now we see that within our own people there are those who will never rise to this challenge. Instead, they give in to their bestial instincts, becoming the mindless monsters that others brand us as. Our dream may yet survive, but only if our society can quell the rage within itself. "
