 undergrowth_king_of_the_tribes_title:0 "King of the Tribes"
 undergrowth_king_of_the_tribes_desc:0 "The clans, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been. There is a change in the cavern-breath, a whisper that brings tidings - the time is right for the goblins of the Tree of Stone to once more join hands. The only question for us, then, is which of the clans will be at the top of the new hierarchy. So sharpen your spears! Hide your daggers! Tomorrow, the Rabble storms forth!"
 undergrowth_clasped_in_chains_title:0 "Clasped in Chains"
 undergrowth_clasped_in_chains_desc:0 "We opened one cage in Dak's dungeon and a dozen orcs ran out. In the next cage, it was two dozen goblins. Just how many slaves was Dak keeping, and what was he going to use them for? We can only be glad that we'll never have to find out. Though it is really quite a shame, to let all this workforce run free..."
 undergrowth_hidden_riches_title:0 "Hidden Riches"
 undergrowth_hidden_riches_desc:0 "Some goblins, eh? They're just so greedy! You free 'em from slavery, and they still won't tell you where the loot is. That's no matter though, we can just torture it out of them the old-fashioned way, and then put them to work in the mines they found."
 undergrowth_secrets_of_the_caves_title:0 "Secrets of the Caves"
 undergrowth_secrets_of_the_caves_desc:0 "Goblins know Serpentspine secrets. We know them better than the dwarves, who rarely venture outside their holds, and we certainly know them better than the orcs, who would never fit into as many tunnels and crevasses as us. We know the hoards, the old ruins, the buried treasures. It's time to tap into the hidden stores of wealth - we'll need it for what's coming next."
 undergrowth_servitude_in_serpentbloom_title:0 "Servitude in Serpentbloom"
 undergrowth_servitude_in_serpentbloom_desc:0 "The freedom of the goblins under Dak was hard-fought and hard-won. But, if you think about it, they didn't do anything - that was all us. Really, they should have to pay us back. Not as slaves though, slavery is so passé. We'll call it servitude, and their debts can be discharged for the low low price of an entire life's worth of labor."
 undergrowth_chains_under_opulence_title:0 "Chains Under Opulence"
 undergrowth_chains_under_opulence_desc:0 "Dak knew what the clans did not: that greatness is built on the back of suffering. Each hold level, each new mage tower, each workshop is built of blood and tears just as much as it is of stone and mortar. Not our blood, of course, but the blood of hundreds, thousands, someday a million slaves. The amount is a small matter: the Tree of Stone is the Goblinhome, and here there are goblins beyond number. Someday—someday soon—they shall all bow before the Goblinthrone."
 undergrowth_hegemony_of_the_tree_title:0 "Hegemony of the Tree"
 undergrowth_hegemony_of_the_tree_desc:0 "The Tree of Stone is the Goblin-Home. It is where legend says the goblins came into being, and it is where most of the goblins in the Serpentspine still reside. To lay claim to it is to claim not just a plot of land, but the very birthright of all goblindom. To have enforced that claim like we have is to pronounce not just to our subjects but to the world - 'The goblins have united. There is something new to fear.'"
 undergrowth_king_under_stone_title:0 "King Under Stone"
 undergrowth_king_under_stone_desc:0 "In times of old, the elders would gather to proclaim a Clanboss. Someone who ruled more of the Tree of Stone would perhaps be an Overboss, or even a Supreme Boss. Away with this frivolity! We have learned from Dak, and from the humans. A boss no longer, our ruler shall hence be titled… Goblinking."
 undergrowth_the_oldest_grudge_title:0 "The Oldest Grudge"
 undergrowth_the_oldest_grudge_desc:0 ""One for one! All for all!\nStab the dwarf and shank the tall!\nWe were here before they came,\nwe will be here when they fall!"\n  -Traditional Undergrowth Goblin war song"
 undergrowth_gaslight_title:0 "Gaslight"
 undergrowth_gaslight_desc:0 "Rules for Rulers number one: do diplomacy! We have done lots of diplomacy. And sure, the diplomats we send usually come back bruised or beheaded, but that hardly matters. And based on these communications, some of the humans say they find great enjoyment in beating up our diplomats - they've even sent us some money to keep the diplomat train going. This is, of course, a win-win situation."
 undergrowth_goblinboss_title:0 "Goblinboss"
 undergrowth_goblinboss_desc:0 "The Rules for Rulers have served us well, but apparently, there are other books. The humans that come to our hold have brought with them a great many describing other forms of non-goblin governance: there's feudalism, republicanism, something called 'anarcho-syndicalism'... The humans complain at length about the system they fled, something called a 'Raj.' The social organization of the caste system, the centralizing authority of the Raja, the mass enslavement of their own kind... it appears we have one more system to learn from."
 undergrowth_the_green_throne_title:0 "The Green Throne"
 undergrowth_the_green_throne_desc:0 "Long ago, this was a place of dwarven rule and Raheni cooperation. Now it's a crumbling ruin that the hold-hogs root through. We're not entirely sure what makes it special, but we know this—grabbing that throne will make us extremely legit. Almost TOO legit."
 undergrowth_branching_out_title:0 "Branching Out"
 undergrowth_branching_out_desc:0 "It turns out that the old routes outside the hold still work! We know this because an adventuring party arrived the other day to wipe us out. Crying and screaming and puking while dropping a bunch of gold coins on the ground made them uncomfortable enough to leave, and in all the hubbub, one of them even left a book behind: 'Rules for Rulers,' it says, by some tigerman. There's even a map inside!"
 undergrowth_gatekeep_title:0 "Gatekeep"
 undergrowth_gatekeep_desc:0 "These 'Rules for Rulers' sure are helpful! One of them describes the practice of getting down on one's knees, which is apparently very important to rulers. The more people that get down on their knees in front of a ruler, the better that ruler is! Anyway, the next chapter said something about making sure your front door is locked."

 ###EVENTS###
 undergrowth_goblin.1.t:0 "Gaslight"
 undergrowth_goblin.1.d:0 "THE RULES OF GOBLINBALL ARE AS FOLLOWS:\nTwo players, each standing approximately ten paces from a center line, shall face each other holding large wooden paddles\nA standard-size goblin no taller than 5' in height shall be placed in the center\nThe goblin shall be curled up with his or her or their chin tucked into his or her or their knees, to prevent the greatest damage to their skeletal structure. Crying encouraged.\nPlay shall proceed until one player scores into the other's net, the goblin suffers sudden and unforeseeable failure of life, or twenty minutes have passed, at which point there will be an intermission.\n\n"I'm telling ya, the moss that grows outside tastes better than the moss that grows inside the caves." The guard stuck a pinky up his nose and flicked away whatever came out.\n\nThe other goblin rolled his eyes. "You just like eating moss."\n\nFrom ahead of the two guards, a dark figure crested a hill on the horizon, twilight shadow casting darkness over their features. The first goblin's eyes narrowed, and the second raised his spear. "Halt, traveler! What business do you have?"\n\nThen the figure turned, and the evening sun made clear their features: bruised and black-eyed was [Root.GetUndergrowthAdvisor], whose uncertainty of gait and swollenness of head had combined to mask their silhouette. To and fro they swayed on their feet, and the second goblin dropped his spear, running forward to catch the goblin before they fell.\n\n"[Root.GetUndergrowthAdvisor]! The diplomat!" The first goblin guard stated. "What, er, what news bring you from the human lands?"\n\nFrom their position slumped over the shoulder of the second guard, [Root.GetUndergrowthAdvisor] weakly raised their battered features. "We played… Goblinball. They loved it.""
 undergrowth_goblin.1.a:0 "We shall look weak, for the humans' benefit and our own."
 undergrowth_goblin.2.t:0 "Goblins of the Tree"
 undergrowth_goblin.2.d:0 "The Tree of Stone, some say it is the first origin of Goblins, even. Us goblins have inhabited this place for millenia, and for as long as we have been in the Tree, we have been squabbling with each other over who gets to be the boss.\n\nIt has not been since the times of Grimka the Despoiler that a powerful enough ruler has risen to unite the Goblins within the Tree for long. In that one instance, Grimka almost destroyed the Dwarves… And since then, many Goblins have tried to unite the tree, most of them met with a dagger to the back, or poison in their cup. No more! In the recent centuries, as the Dwarven roads to the west fell silent, the Tree of Stone has seen three clans rise to prominence.\n\nAmbersniffer, the newest of the clans, rising as a clan shortly after the decline of the Topaz hold, they're even known to attempt raids on Ovdal Kanzad to this day and are constantly lurking around the Ambermines, looking for opportunities to strike out and finish the hold for good through uniting the other clans.\n\nPoisoned Rock, a conniving clan that broke out from the orcish camp of the Anduz Quarry through poisoning their enslavers, using poisonous rocks. The story has been passed down for generations, inspiring fierce fighters, unwilling to bend the knee without a fight and staking their claim to protect themselves.\n\nDirtwater, the oldest of the clans in the Tree, with their Shamans passing down tales of their travels and even things such as great battles against the strange tiger-like men. Housed around the ancient site of the Earthseed, this clan has seen the rise and fall of many other tribes, and wishes to put an end to the squabbling.\n\nIn the Tree of Stone, clans rise and fall often, but these powerful clans, driven by the second fall of Grôzumdihr and of Ovdal Kanzad's stagnation have consolidated their powers, and have openly staked their claim to the whole of the Tree of Stone!"
 undergrowth_goblin.2.a:0 "[Root.GetName] will be victorious!"
 undergrowth_goblin.3.t:0 "A Goblin Hold"
 undergrowth_goblin.3.d:0 "'How will we build our motherland, expand its grand embrace?\nFrom Ovdal-az- n comes the reply: The work continues apace.'\n	-Miit Mit, published [GetYear] AA\n\nWalk with me through the floors of Grozumdihr. From its origins as ruin and rubble, the hold of Grozumdihr has grown to grand proportions. The hubbub of daily life fills the corridors and levels of the ancient structure, a din that bespeaks the controlled chaos so common to goblin society. But let us examine the case more thoroughly.\n\n[Root.GetUndergrowthSlaves1] [Root.GetUndergrowthSlaves2] [Root.GetUndergrowthSlaves3] [Root.GetUndergrowthSlaves4]\n\nThe hold of Grozumdihr is a paradise of enterprise, of production, of administration. It is well-guarded and well-managed; every individual in the hold has managed to reach their full potential. And what of you, eh? Which role do you do best?"
 undergrowth_goblin.3.a:0 "Don't bother running - the chain is already on you."

 undergrowthorcs:0 "Upon arriving at the hold, we are greeted by orcish guards, standing tall in their gleaming armor. How handsome they are, how disciplined! How strange it is, that the boots they wear appear to be bolted to the ground."
 undergrowthhumans:0 "Inside, the upper floor of the hold is taken up by an expansive marketplace where human merchants hawk their wares. But look—there are only humans in the vendor stalls, how odd to see no goblins or orcs or harimari. Yet we must think nothing of it, nor must we consider how the stalls have cots in them, yet no door."
 undergrowthdwarves:0 "Let us go down a level now, to the mines below. They are loud with the sound of grinding mills, the clanging of pickaxe on stone, the rattle of railcar on iron rail. The dwarves are hard at work, watched carefully by their goblin bosses. They are chained—not to each other, but instead to the pickaxes they hold, the railcars they push, the mills they turn."
 undergrowthharimari:0 "And here is the heart of it all: the last level of the hold, the place where orders are sent by dumbwaiter to places above. The scribbling of pen on paper fills the room, and all we see are bright, shining tiger eyes in the darkness—row on row, a thousand lumimoths moving in concert. The harimari are here, doing the business of administrating the hold—and nothing else must they do. See, on their ankles—the chains that bind them to their desks. And their quills, delicately tied to their wrists."

 undergrowth_goblin.4.t:0 "Metals struck in the tree of stone!"
 undergrowth_goblin.4.d:0 "Our goblins have been hard at work, digging the roots of the tree, and finding metals beyond measure. Wait, how did you see this?"
 undergrowth_goblin.4.a:0 "Ok!"

 ###TOOLTIPS###
 undergrowth_goblin_2_tt:0 "The legitimacy of our rule is shaky, with pretenders ready to take the spot of our Clanboss.

 undergrowth_goblinboss_trigger_two_tt:0 "No known nation not of Undergrowth Goblin culture can have their capital in the tree of stone."
 undergrowth_increase_claim_tt:0 "§GIncrease§! the level of "§YClaim to the Undergrowth§!" modifier"
 undergrowth_increase_claim_final_tt:0 "After this, our subjects will begin to settle down and settle the tree, if we have any. Take care to not get stuck!"
 undergrowth_hidden_riches_tt:0 "Five provinces fulfilling the mission requirements randomly change their trade good to §YIron§!, §YCopper§!, or rarely §YGold§!."
 undergrowth_servitude_tt:0 "Every province fulfilling the mission requirements gets '§YServitude in Serpentbloom§!' for §Y15 years,§! giving the following effects:\nLocal Unrest §R+2.00§!\nLocal Development Cost §+15%§!\nLocal Manpower Modifier §G+50.0%§!"
 undergrowth_clasped_in_chains_tt:0 "The development stolen from this hold will be distributed amongst the caverns."
