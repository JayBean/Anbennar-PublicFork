 #Events
 taychendi.1.t: "Death Of An Ally"
 taychendi.1.d: "Alliances are fickle things in the war torn land of Taychend. Bound by blood and personal relationships rather than treaties, alliances among the Taychendi rulers often end when one of the partners meets their demise. Unfortunately, we just received news of the death of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName]. Thus, our alliance with them has come to an end."
 taychendi.1.a: "A sad day."
 taychendi.1.b: "This may effect the war..."
 taychend_no_stab_loss: "No §YStability§! is lost despite the alliance breaking during a war."
 taychend_kid_ruler_future_general: "When our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] ascends to the throne, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will also lead our armies."
 
 taychendi.2.t: "A Death, A Storm Brewing"
 taychendi.2.d: "Terrible news! The sovereign is dead! This can only bring horrible consequences for our realm. Whoever takes the empty throne must now navigate the fickle and unstable politics involved in the succession of the new monarch. Our provincial governors and local nobility grow disobedient, acting increasingly autonomous from our rule due to the weakness of the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nEven worse, the subject lords have made their move, taking full advantage of the current instability of our realm. They have raised their armies, seeking to gain freedom for themselves. A great storm is coming, we must act quickly."
 taychendi.2.a: "Rebels!"
 tayched_break_alliances: "All of our §YAlliances§! have §Rended§! along with our ruler's reign."
 
 taychendi.3.t: "A Death, A New Lord"
 taychendi.3.d: "Terrible news! The sovereign is dead! This can only bring horrible consequences for our realm. Whoever takes the empty throne must now navigate the fickle and unstable politics involved in the succession of the new monarch. Our provincial governors and local nobility grow disobedient, acting increasingly autonomous from our rule due to the weakness of the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nFortunately, our subjects have yet to show any sign of disloyalty. Whether they are truly loyal, or they have been sufficiently cowed into obedience by our previous lords, our vassals haven’t made a single move since our previous monarch’s death."
 taychendi.3.a: "They have made a wise choice."
 
 taychendi.4.t: "Disorder And Disobedience"
 taychendi.4.d: "Our new sovereign is untested, and is unable to wield the same authority as their predecessor. Local nobility refuse to submit to our rule, and the population grows restless. Our administration has become overburdened, and is unable to properly extract revenue from our lands. We will have to solve this problem, one way or another."
 taychendi.4.a: "Create new subjects from our lands."

 taychendi.4.dd: "My line need not concern itself with this."
 taychend_do_it_yourself: "§YThis event shall not fire again.§!"
 
 taychendi.5.t: "Buying Boats"
 taychendi.5.d: "The lords of Taychend never bothered much with the sea. They could never afford to, for their rivals on land were always a much bigger threat. Even the lords of Oremvand and Nagyar Vyechei focused their attention on inland matters rather than the lands beyond. Thus, naval affairs were left entirely in the hands of the merchant guilds, who held an exclusive monopoly on shipbuilding techniques and naval expertise.\n\nOur lord has reached out to the merchant guilds, seeking to purchase ships for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fleet. The merchant guilds are happy to accept, on the promise of more favorable treatment by our kingdom."

 taychendi.6.t: "Outraged Enemies Attack Us!"
 taychendi.6.d: "In Taychend, the death of a ruler is always seen as a good opportunity to exploit the weaknesses of an enemy. When those weaknesses are great, the resulting opportunity can be too - and such has occured here. A terrible crisis has befallen our nation, as the death of our previous ruler has given those who despise us the confidence they need to declare war! Woe befalls the land, as every elf knows that dark days are ahead. However, if we can overcome this, we can shatter that false confidence of the enemy, sundering memories of our aggressive expansion alongside it - and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will surely benefit from a glorious victory."
 taychendi.6.a: "A terrible crisis and a terrific opportunity..."
 taychend_coalition_declared_on_ruler_death_tt: "All countries with §G>100§! §YAggressive Expansion§! against us have declared a §GCoalition War§!!"
 
 religious_reforms.6.t: "Taychendi Reform"
 religious_reforms.6.d5: "We have achieved the unthinkable, the impossible. The great cycle of warlordism, which had for so long plagued Taychend since the ruin, has been ended by us. The establishment of a Taychendi empire, centralized, stable, and united. Through the many trials and tribulations we faced, we have managed to form a state that stood firm against all resistance the peoples of Taychend formed against it. Our empire is The Empire of Taychend, and, gods willing, the final empire of Taychend."
 religious_reforms.6.d4: "The peoples of the provinces are not taking the standardization of the Taychendi writing system lying down. Loyalist governors have now started advocating greater autonomy from our rule, and in every sense have turned their backs on our kingdom. It seems as though the homogenizing of the Taychendi script was the final straw for many against our policies of centralization. Our agents report the formation of militias and armies all across the countryside, many organized by our own governors, clearly being used as a sword at our throats. It seems this is the final test, if we can outlast this crisis, Taychend will be ours for the taking."
 religious_reforms.6.d3: "The decision to destroy the autonomy of the cities has caused widespread anger and outrage. Both the urban elites and the urban poor have banded together, our governors and loyal officials having been defenestrated! The city militias have closed the gates to our armies, and now proclaim full independence from our rule! This is a true test of our strength, we must not falter, lest we fall like the empires that came before us."
 religious_reforms.6.d2: "The cults are not pleased with our recent attempts to control them. Already their leaders have begun organizing their members, stocking piling weapons and supplies, and calling upon other cults in our land to do the same. We knew it was not going to be easy to bring the cults to heel, yet it seems we underestimated their true power. We must mobilize the army, as a new period of religious strife is upon us."
 religious_reforms.6.d1: "The replacement of the local lords with loyalists has not gone perfectly, but in the end they all submitted. Our loyalists now rule on the ground, and we can safely say we have control of our own territory now. Still, the reorganization and redistribution of land ownership in our kingdom has caused some instability, but we will recover."
 religious_reforms.6.a: "We will continue with the current course, no matter what resistance we face."

 taychendi.10.t:0 "The Urban Warlords"
 taychendi.10.d:0 "Since the Ruin, the vast slums of Nanru Nakar have been dominated by “Urban Warlords”, gang leaders who carve their own territory out of the great city. Most of the time they are content to acknowledge the authority of Nanru Nakar’s rulers, and don't cause major disturbances as that would also hinder their own affairs. This is unfortunately no longer the case.\n\nThough the situation is extremely complex, we can surmise that a close relative of the head of one of the biggest criminal groups of [2496.GetName] was found dead - poisoned. The boss, after accusing another urban warlord of the act (the Vettaga Talni, from [2495.GetName]), started an all out war against not only them, but every group they even loosely associated with, and other gangs are starting to join one of the two sides.\n\nThe two districts are now in flames, with a lot of the residents barricaded in their homes, fearing going outside, and many roads already devastated from the fighting. [2497.GetName] is spared, but for how long?"

The gravity of the abuses kept escalating sadly, and in the last couple years it became clear the corp is closer in nature to the gangs it should be fighting than an instrument of the law."

 taychendi.12.t:0 "Philosopher Advocate Kheiosist Principles"
 taychendi.12.d:0 "Since Laskaris the Conqueror invaded Taychend, ideas from the Kheionai’s peculiar religion have begun to influence some of our subjects. An already very famous local scholar is one of these people; he's so taken with their ideas that he has started advocating embracing some of them - the so-called Axierophonic Mandate - in our state.\nThe war weariness of our population made his ideas quickly very popular, the military purpose being the security of the people (instead of a tool for the ruler's own personal glory) chiefly amongst them. Some of our subject even went as far as proclaiming they'd rather follow the heathens philosophies than our Cults."

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] asks too much; I grant it not. For as long as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will live, [prophecy_vassal.GetName] will stand tall."\n\nThe augury is spreading like wildfire; many in the court believe we should listen to the oracle and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s advisors counsel is to stop the integration, at least for now.\nIn our vassal's lands everyone, from peasant to warlord, is questioning [Root.Monarch.GetName] right to rule them when even the gods are against it."

 oren_nayiru.2.d: "The cult of Vherenar Freesword, formed in the fires of the Second Gophiran Empire’s collapse, has long been a persistent nuisance for the rulers of Taychend. A secretive organisation, compartmentalised into hidden and autonomous “cells”, led by Kavalali warrior priests, they are widespread in the slave populations of Taychend, dedicated to vanquishing the evil of slavery.

The Kavalali of the Uesrennu and Katelperai cells have argued that this Surael is the last of the Elusive Ones of legend, and that the arrival of the Exemplars have heralded the coming of a new dawn over Taychend. As their millenarian fervour infects the rest of the cult, cells across Taychend have spiralled into a theological flurry of increasingly radical proclamations – the Tenets of Uesrennu, that declared a new faith, that of the Oren Nayiru, or One Sun, supreme among them.\n\nThe Oren Nayiru now call for the abolition of slavery, for the ejection of all invaders, for the reorganisation of land and society, for the replacement of warlords with the pious Kavalali, and for the spread of Nayiru’s truth to all peoples who would hear them.

 oren_nayiru.5.t: "Serfs Turn to the Sun"
 oren_nayiru.5.d: "The imposition of serfdom has been a vital part of the “Kheionisation” process, as Ameion turns the free and mobile Taychendi peasantry into serfs tied to the land they work on. It has done wonders to prevent warlordism, and facilitate a turn away from the extensive slavery that has underpinned the Taychendi economy for so long. It has also been one of the largest contributing factors to opposition against Kheionai rule. With the Oren Nayiru promising freedom and independence, the Taychendi serfs of Ameion have flocked to them in great numbers – unless we deploy forceful measures to stem the spread of this new faith, it is likely we may continue to lose more of our subjects to this rebellious religion."

 oren_nayiru.6.t: "Oren Nayiru Raids Intensify"
 oren_nayiru.6.d: "The Oren Nayiru are dedicated to destroying slavery in all its forms in Taychend, and to this end they are persistent in attacking slave caravans, pens, mines and all those who have a stake in the institution as a whole. They have done great damage to the trade, and the economic elites of our country are becoming increasingly frustrated at our inability to do anything to stop them – they demand an immediate crackdown on the Oren Nayiru. Though this is unlikely to stop the raids entirely, and these measures are always extremely destructive, it may heavily damage the faith’s power base."
 oren_nayiru.6.a: "Our land is more important than the merchants’ property."
 oren_nayiru.6.b: "Launch sweeping reprisal attacks."

 oren_nayiru.7.t: "A Knife Behind Every Corner"
 oren_nayiru.7.d: "Due to their wide appeal among the lower classes, the Oren Nayiru have infiltrated every level of the population, as slaves, servants and workmen. Thanks to the recent assassination of a prominent figure, a wave of, frankly, justified paranoia has spread across the realm. Many demand a sweeping investigation of Oren Nayiru sympathisers – something likely to be an extremely expensive, time consuming, and mostly fruitless endeavour. Nonetheless, if we do nothing, it will certainly make us look weak."
 oren_nayiru.7.a: "It’s not worth the trouble"
 oren_nayiru.7.b: "Launch the investigation"

 oren_nayiru.8.t: "Whispers of Freedom"
 oren_nayiru.8.d: "The Oren Nayiru was once the Cult of Vherenar, an organisation dedicated to vanquishing the evils of slavery. Organised into elusive and compartmentalised “cells”, hidden among the slave populations of Taychend, It is no surprise that it is amongst the slaves that the Oren Nayiru have spread the fastest. All over Taychend, whispers of freedom spread among those in bondage, with many seeing the Oren Nayiru as their only hope in winning it."
 oren_nayiru.8.a: "Black-iron chains turn white-hot."

 oren_nayiru.9.t: "Oren Nayiru Uprising!"
 oren_nayiru.9.d: "The Oren Nayiru have one wish – the rise up and destroy the tyrannical regimes that dominate Taychend. Though the leaders of the faith, the Kavalali of Uesrennu and the other strongholds of the Oren Nayiru, insist on waiting for the right time and rising up together, there are occasions when local cells do not always bow down to their superiors’ wishes.\n\nThis has happened recently, as a few rogue cells have launched an uprising against us. Though the rebellion may cause some damage, it has nonetheless exposed those cells locations and operational networks, leaving them open to a reprisal."
 oren_nayiru.9.a: "Good News?"

 oren_nayiru.10.t: "Ghosts in the Hills"
 oren_nayiru.10.d: "Most slaves, naturally, crave freedom – and the Oren Nayiru has given them an unprecedented opportunity to realise that. Utilising the extensive resources of the faith, many slaves have escaped bondage and formed maroon communities in the many hills of Taychend, defending their freedom with their lives and launching raids of liberation and vengeance from their hill-top communities. Breaking these entrenched communities is extremely costly in blood and treasure, but if we are to retain control of our land it is nonetheless extremely important."
 oren_nayiru.10.a: "They are too costly to pursue"
 oren_nayiru.10.b: "Rally the men and attack!"

 oren_nayiru.11.t: "Dark Sun Revealed"
 oren_nayiru.11.d: "Within the Oren Nayiru, power is concentrated in the hands of a few important cells, whose Kavalali lead the faith as a whole. They are well armed, equipped, and above all well hidden. The discovery of one of these cells, therefore, is a veritable coup for our nation’s security.\n\nThis is not likely to be easy, and it will certainly trigger a wider uprising by the faith, but by launching an all out attack on this location, we can greatly disrupt the Oren Nayiru as a whole and set the movement back greatly."
 oren_nayiru.11.a: "Burn them out"
 oren_nayiru.11.b: "We don’t have the resources right now"

 oren_nayiru.12.t: "To Bring Down the Sun"
 oren_nayiru.12.d: "The rapid rise of the Oren Nayiru has prompted a serious debate on how to deal with this new radical force in Taychend. Their message has a broad appeal, and the actual centres of their faith are extremely elusive, and when uncovered prove to be well fortified on top of that.\n\nWhile one group proposes that we attempt to use reason to convince converts away from the Oren Nayiru – a strategy that is likely to be more time consuming and expensive – there are many, particularly among the landowners of the countryside, who propose that we use extensive violence to persecute the faith.\n\nBy burning out the traitors who have converted, in the fields or in the slave pens and mines, we can cut back on the Oren Nayiru’s power base and expose them to further attacks. This, however, is likely to cause widespread devastation. Ultimately, the choice is [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s to make."

 oren_nayiru.100.t: "In Spite of Silver"
 oren_nayiru.100.d: "Elrandar Silverspite watched as the sun set over the Kalavend. His mercenary company pitched camp behind him. They came from every corner of Taychend, some even further beyond, fought for glory or fortune or adventure, or because it was simply all they knew. The captain turned his gaze to the black-iron collar in his hand once again – why did he fight? Why did he command, lead?\n\nAn elven woman spoke from behind him. Silverspite turned to see his second in command, his Velara. “You won’t know until you use it,” she said, a grave look on her face that matched Silverspite’s own. The steel mask he usually wore was wracked with doubt, worry, desperate hope. He turned back to the sun, wished that it would give its light just a little longer.\n\nSilverspite had found the collar when he went to fetch water, on a skeleton in a stream – the simple ring of iron had radiated a power so awesome the mercenary could feel it in his heart. Purpose, he knew, was nothing without power. His father was a Sun Elven Exemplar, as was Velara before she turned her cloak. They espoused a glorious purpose, to vanquish the dark – but they were powerless against it. Darkness – weakness – infected their hearts, blinded them. It had led his father to abandon his Taychendi mother, left her stranded in the shadow of their great crusades. Eventually, the darkness had consumed her too.\n\nThe mercenary would not let it do the same to him. He would not let his own purpose, his own destiny, whatever it was, wither in the dark. He unclasped the back of the collar, snapped it around his neck. A moment of nothing, then radiant, brilliant light, then an explosion of roiling steam and smoke. It consumed the mercenary, raising an alarm through Velara and any others nearby – but soon enough a figure emerged, clad in a suit of hulking, jagged armour, of black-iron scales interwoven with steel-like-plate, a dragon in armour form. Before them, Elrandar Silverspite stood, clad in the Armour of Yodhan. In Sedamurax, the Iron Maw. Beneath the visor, the mercenary smiled."

 oren_nayiru.101.t: "A Meeting in the Dark"
 oren_nayiru.101.d: "An armoured Silverspite stood straight as the High Kavalali of Uesrennu circled him. The leaders of the Oren Nayiru, the failure of the Calsithara Revolt had hardened them – while many in the faith cried out for revolution, the High Kavalali urged moderation. The Uesrennu High Kavalali were the last refuge of a more bellicose position – but even they had their doubts. And so, for the last week, they had been testing Silverspite. First, his capabilities. He had the strength of fifty men, durability beyond precursor steel, and above all control over gravity itself. In emulation of dragonflight, he could soar through the air at terminal velocity, a single spinning charge with his twin blades devastating an entire battleline. He had power – he could destroy armies single handedly –  so they tested his purpose.\n\n“And you know of the tenets, of the proclamations of the Kavalali?” asked one. “You admit to the principle of deliberation, of decision by many, not one?” Asked another. “You decry the tyrant kings of ages past – you would not rule as Yodhan did, would you?” “Have you decried the Kheionai too?” “You must!”\nSilverspite batted their accusations away. “I know the tenets.” He replied. His voice was clear, ever-serious, nearly emotionless. “I would act as the leader of the faith, not as a tyrant.” “Not as Yodhan but as Kamrayakval.” “The Kheionai are as tyrannical as the rest. They need to be taught the truth of Nayiru.” The questions ceased, as the Kavalali regarded Silverspite. They were still hesitant. “Disunity is what caused Calsithara’s efforts to fail.” Silverspite said, breaking the silence. “If the most important cells named me Kamrayakval, the entire faith will support me. I know it.”\nFinally, one among them – the most senior – spoke. “The entire faith, yes. But before you found that armour, you were a mere mercenary,” the High Kavalal said, a cold expression on his face. “So I must ask, are you a member of the faith… Elrandar Kalinzuir?”\n\nSilverspite’s eyes narrowed beneath his helmet, as the mention of his father’s name made him grimace. A note of inexplicable fear struck those in the room – the guards drew their sabres. “I believe,” Silverspite said, every word considered, “In the will of Nayiru. My father called him Surael. It is said, across the sea, Nayiru sent another warrior to liberate the land from darkness. You may doubt me now, but when I rise, High Kavalal, and Dawn furrows Taychend’s fields with the blood of its enemies? You will see what Surael’s Champion truly looks like. Here I stand. Will you rise with me, or remain in the dark?"
 oren_nayiru.101.a: "Within the hour, the Uesrennu Kavalali agree to support Silverspite’s claim"

 oren_nayiru.102.t: "Eclipse"
 oren_nayiru.102.d: "Silverspite knelt before the High Kavalali, as a crowd 100,000 strong surrounded them.  As foreseen, an eclipse set in, and the world darkened. After two years of political wrangling, the faith was finally united. A representative of each of the most powerful cells held a crown together above his head – they spoke in turn. “In the name of Nayiru”, said Uesrennu’s High Kavalal. “We charge you,” said Katelperai’s. “To lead our armies,” said Clematar. “And guide our faith,” Nagar Vyechei. “From this day,” Gophira. “To your final day,” Sthanan. “A sword of dawn,” Rakkabuttai, “A voice of reason,” Royakottar. Nakar Kilaeik, Kriadvai, then Mlerek took one word each. “As.” “Our.” “Kamrayakval.”\n\nAt total eclipse, the High Kavalali, as one, lowered the crown onto Silverspite’s head. The Kamrayakval rose, a dragon in armour-form. The crowd was silent as half watched the blackened sun and the rest his blackened armour. The Kamrayakval searched the crowd for a moment, gave his mercenary company a nod, then began his speech. “Five Cycles, we have lived in darkness. Cast into it by the Kheionai, the warlords, the Slaver-Nobles, by the very dragons I’m wearing on my back!” Silverspite unsheathed his sword. “But that ends today! It ends here! It ends when we rise and conquer the world as sun conquers night!” Anger crept into his voice – Silverspite caught it, then harnessed it. “Everyone here! Everyone who takes up the black banner of the Dawn! We are ALL born with purpose. To bring light to dark! To furrow the fields with the blood of the warlords and the tyrants, the slavers and the invaders! We bore that purpose, but for hundreds of thousands of years and more we have been weak! Weak! Well no more! Because now, we are powerful! Because now I am here and I AM POWER! So follow me, brothers, sisters! Give your lives and your blood for DAWN! And to any who oppose us, who stand in our way, to the darkness and its soldiers, I DECLARE WAR! WAR FOR THE DEATH OF DARKNESS! WAR FOR DAWN!”\n\nAs Silverspite thrust his blade to the eclipse, the sun began to emerge from behind the moon’s shadow. The crowd was silent for a short moment – then an elf in the crowd called “War!” A second pause, then “WAR!” came the cry of the crowd. “WAR!” The Oren Nayiru thrust fists and sabres and muskets and spears into the air, and “WAR!” echoed the declaration, for the gods, for Nayiru himself to hear. “WAR!” “WAR!” “WAR!” “WAR!” “WAR!”"

 oren_nayiru.103.d: "Silverspite twirled the twin blades in his hands over in a practised motion. He crouched in a tree line to the right of the battlefield, watching as his formation halted before the enemy ranks – began to exchange fire. The last battle of the war. Volley and countervolley devastated both sides – though his own forces were seeing the worse of it. No matter. Let them die – he’d repay it in kind, twice over and more. The Kamrayakval took a deep breath, rose, then felt his stomach turn as gravity itself turned upside-down. The sight of battle became the sight of leaves and branches, then open sky. He knew the enemy saw him, a dark star rising against the blue of day.\n\nThe Kamrayakval picked up speed as he ascended, tumbling into a ball – then he turned the world again. Aimed himself at the enemy battleline. Dived. Faster yet faster, he picked up speed and strength and sheer velocity. The wind whipped through him, plate turning red with heat. Silverspite stretched out his arms, sabres flashing, then twisted his body into a controlled spin. He glimpsed the enemy break at his descent. It didn’t matter. When he neared the ground, he turned gravity once more, then again, up to slow his fall then forwards to propel him into a charge.\n\nContact. He heard screams, frantic shouting. Saw limbs and guts and heads and gore fly as he eviscerated his way through the enemy line at terminal velocity, a whirlwind of death, unstoppable, invincible. Blood splashed against his visor, his armour, but he didn’t need to see to destroy. His blades hungered, and so the Dragon consumed.\n\nHe turned gravity up, then down, then up, rising into the air in a controlled ascent, blades like wings as he spread his arms to slow his upwards fall. He saw through bloodied eyes the remains of his charge. How many had he killed? Thousands? Tens of thousands? His soldiers surged forwards, charging over a field of broken corpses, of mutilated bodies, elves dead or wishing they were. Silverspite smiled, aimed his body at the fleeing enemy, then turned gravity again. The Kamrayakval’s War was over. He had won."

 oren_nayiru.104.t: "Kamrayakval Defeated"
 oren_nayiru.104.d: "Silverspite stared blankly ahead as he slumped back in his shattered throne. The throne room was cannon-scarred, crumbling. They’d be in here soon, the full force of his enemies. So be it. This would be his grave – but he would not go without a fight. The Kamrayakval stood, grabbed the twin blades by his side. He felt the dragon lash out within him, the anger and spite and wrath and rage and ruin threatening to burst and consume everything around him – but he pushed it back down, for now. For now.\nThey surged through every entrance they could find or make. Some even dropped down through the ceiling. Storms of soldiers, each clutching muskets or sabres or spears, some mages, some heavily armoured, most conscripts. It mattered little what they were, of course – when Silverspite lunged forwards with the force of gravity behind him, elven bodies turned to mutilated gore all the same.\nThe Kamrayakval cut and slashed and charged and rent flesh and steel and bone. Waves of men fell at his swords – when one snapped, he picked up another from the dead and kept fighting, kept moving forwards, kept up the relentless flashing whirlwind of death, the slaughter and the ruin. He felt magefire and musketballs and arrow and quarrel pelt him – some made it through, tore through his body. Still, he kept fighting. The rage boiled over, now – he could feel himself slipping, losing himself. To the dragon, to bloodlust, to spite. He was only half aware of how he roared, how he raged.\nHe had to cut himself free multiple times, when his limbs snared themselves in gore and guts. The blood blinded him. The fire burned him. Still he fought on. Still, he killed. Still, Silverspite stood. In spite of those who doubted him, in spite of those who had betrayed him, in spite of those who had destroyed him.\nBy the time the dragon took over, Silverspite was already a dead elf walking. He bled from a dozen wounds, bones broken and scarred by fire. He was barely conscious when he found himself bursting through the roof of the throne room, into the sky above, falling upwards, then into an uncontrolled spin, away, away, then crashing into a nearby river, bathed in orange by the setting sun. He felt the water rushing into his armour – felt it burn his lungs. Then dusk, and everything went dark."
 oren_nayiru.104.a: "They never found his body, nor the armour. His war was over"

 oren_nayiru.105.t: "The Sinews of War"
 oren_nayiru.105.d: "The Oren Nayiru, being hyper-radical zealots they are, call for essentially the complete restructuring of society, including wide-scale economic reform, a process that will undoubtedly leave most of Taychend’s wealthy mercantile elite destitute – or worse, dead. It is no surprise, then, that the rich merchant houses, traders, caravaneers and slavers have thrown their lot in with the forces battling the Kamrayakval, and have sent us considerable funds for the war effort."
 oren_nayiru.105.a: "Splendid news!"

 oren_nayiru.106.t: "Elites Rally!"
 oren_nayiru.106.d: "When the Kamrayakval declared war on Taychend, one of his very explicit targets were the warlords who still remained in control of much of the region. While he has since taken some of those warlords under his banner – provided they offer at least a semi-earnest conversion to his faith, of course – the banners of Orenvalyam have nonetheless presented an existential threat to the landowners and warlords arrayed against them. With that in mind, they have pledged men and resources to our cause, so we can put down the Kamrayakval together."
 oren_nayiru.106.a: "Fantastic news!"

 oren_nayiru.107.t: "Slaves No More!"
 oren_nayiru.107.d: "To claim that the institution of slavery has done more to fill the Oren Nayiru’s ranks than any other factor is to state the obvious. Growing as it did from a religious brotherhood specifically dedicated to vanquishing it, the Kamrayakval’s forces have been swelled with masses of freed slaves, and the Oren Nayiru have, obviously, made a point of freeing any of those they come across.\n\nThis has also resulted in significant unrest within our own slave stock – in [oren_nayiru_slave_revolt.GetName], the slaves have risen up against their masters, pledged support for Silverspite, and caused significant damage while doing so."
 oren_nayiru.107.a: "Why can’t a slave ever just learn their place?"

 oren_nayiru.108.t: "Warlord Defections!"
 oren_nayiru.108.d: "Taychendi warlords are notorious for following whichever way the wind is blowing. A single lost battle is often followed by a wave of defections, as warlords seek power at the side of those most likely to hold it. Though we continue to resist him, the Kamrayakval has won many, many battles, and those warlords who fight for us are increasingly leaving our employ to join him, in return for simple oaths of loyalty, and paper-conversions."
 oren_nayiru.108.a: "Cowards, the lot of them!"

 oren_nayiru.109.t: "In the Name of Nayiru"
 oren_nayiru.109.d: "When the Kamrayakval declared war under the eclipse, he called on his faithful to kill the servants of darkness, and furrow the fields with their blood. His forces have taken that message to heart. Across Silverspite’s new territories, the banners of the Oren Nayiru put enemies and unbelievers to the sword. Though the Kamrayakval has attempted – half-heartedly, in many cases – to reign in the excesses of his troops, this has done very little, and sword-point conversions have become extremely common."
 oren_nayiru.109.a: "What else would we expect from these madmen?"

 oren_nayiru.110.t: "Silverspite Storms a Fort!"
 oren_nayiru.110.d: "There are countless myths and half-lost historical records detailing the Armour of Yodhan’s capabilities on the battlefield. For centuries, they were thought by learned elves to be mere fiction. Unfortunately for the enemies of Elrandar Silverspite, they have been proven wrong again and again and again.\n\nAnd unfortunately for the garrison of [silverspite_sieges_fort.GetName], Elrandar Silverspite’s incredible power has been levied against them. Like a hurricane of flashing steel and dragon-scale plate, the Kamrayakval descended on the fort from above and effectively annihilated the garrison, cutting down all those who didn’t surrender, his infamous twin blades rending flesh and steel alike."
 oren_nayiru.110.a: "Why couldn’t he have found some normal relic in that stream?"

 oren_nayiru.1100.t: "Silverspite Storms a Fort!" #(Orenvalyam Version)
 oren_nayiru.1100.d: "There are countless myths and half-lost historical records detailing the Armour of Yodhan’s capabilities on the battlefield. For centuries, they were thought by learned elves to be mere fiction. Unfortunately for the enemies of Elrandar Silverspite, they have been proven wrong again and again and again.\n\nAnd unfortunately for the garrison of [silverspite_sieges_fort.GetName], Elrandar Silverspite’s incredible power has been levied against them. Like a hurricane of flashing steel and dragon-scale plate, the Kamrayakval descended on the fort from above and effectively annihilated the garrison, cutting down all those who didn’t surrender, his infamous twin blades rending flesh and steel alike."
 oren_nayiru.1100.a: "Why couldn’t he have found some normal relic in that stream?"

 oren_nayiru.111.t: "Ruthless Repression"
 oren_nayiru.111.d: "Though the Oren Nayiru claim to fight for the dawn, they thrive in the darkness. They hide among the peasantry and slaves and serfs, in the hills and forests, within fields of maize and rows of slum housing. In an effort to flush the Oren Nayiru out, and re-establish supremacy, our forces have recently set some of our lands aflame – and committed a variety of unspeakable atrocities in the process."
 oren_nayiru.111.a: "Like follows like, and the cycle continues"

 oren_nayiru.112.t: "The Grip of Famine"
 oren_nayiru.112.d: "Taychend’s food security is notoriously non-existant. Though the land itself is impressively fertile, even relatively minor conflicts have a tendency to cause great damage to cultivation efforts, usually thanks to the deaths of those trying to do the cultivating. The Kamrayakval’s War is not a minor conflict.\n\nWith much of the day-to-day fighting occurring in the countryside, as peasants and escaped slaves clash with warlords and soldiers who have become very well-acquainted with the use of fire, it has caused an incredible amount of damage to the region’s agricultural base. Famine has set in rapidly and indiscriminately."
 oren_nayiru.112.a: "After this is over, we may well rule over a realm of corpses."

 oren_nayiru.113.t: "Fotistrépei Fight to the End!"
 oren_nayiru.113.d: "The Fotistrépei, those Taychendi who have become Kheionised soldiers under Ameion’s employ, are not well loved by the Oren Nayiru. Widely seen as traitors to their Taychendi roots, they are also despised for their significant role in putting down native Taychenid rebellions, no matter their religious affiliation – as a result, the Kamrayakval’s forces have taken to showing no quarter to the Fotistrépei when they find them.\n\nThis has had a significant impact on the Fotistrépei – knowing they will find no quarter on the battlefield, and fearing repercussions for their families should the Kamrayakval emerge victorious, the vast majority of the auxiliary corps has committed themselves completely to the Anti-Orenvalyam cause, determined to never surrender nor retreat in battle without exacting an equal toll on the Oren Nayiru.\n\nThe phrase “Fotistrépei fight to the end!” has become a rallying cry both on and off the battlefield. if we are to crush Silverspite’s rebellion, we will undoubtedly need to utilise their power."
 oren_nayiru.113.a: "Their loyalty will be rewarded – and remembered!"

 oren_nayiru.114.t: "Our People Massacred!"
 oren_nayiru.114.d: "Naturally, the Oren Nayiru despise the Kheionai, seeing them as foreign invaders exploiting Taychend’s land and people and destroying Taychendi culture. The Klereyen, those Taychendi who have converted to the Kheionai ways, are despised even more, seen as traitors.\n\nWith the Kamrayakval sweeping over Taychend, his forces have developed a habit of mistreating – and massacring – any Kheionai and Klereyen civilians they can get their hands on. Though he has issued orders to stop any “targeted” violence, it has done little to stem the tide of atrocities, and recently a particularly vicious attack caused widespread devastation in some of our provinces."
 oren_nayiru.114.a: "The Barbhen show their true colours!"

 oren_nayiru.115.t: "Taychendi Serfs Defect!"
 oren_nayiru.115.d: "Ameion’s imposition of serfdom on the Taychendi – often framed as a “moral alternative to slavery” – has likely been one of the greatest sources of discontent among the empire’s subjugated peoples. Their much coveted freedom restricted, the peasantry fell into the arms of the Oren Nayiru, who they believed could provide the organisation they need to throw off Ambhen domination – recently, a wave of serf rebellions has erupted, with the rebels declaring in favour of the Kamrayakval"
 oren_nayiru.115.a: "A foreseeable disaster"

 oren_nayiru.116.t: "Attack on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 oren_nayiru.116.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] sat uncomfortably in [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] seat as notables from across the realm gathered in the great hall. There were generals, powerful merchants, noble landowners and warlords both – they had gathered to discuss the war, the Kamrayakval, and now, while famine gripped the nation, they would feast for their eventual victory. Four great tables had been set up there, at the heart of [Root.GetName]’s capital, while the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sat at the dais, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family and closest advisors by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side.\n\nOne of those advisors was leaning in close, telling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] about some important detail or other. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] ignored him. Ignored the toasts and lively conversations within the hall, the wine and festivities.\n\nInstead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was focused on one of the guards, who stood by the great doors at the very far end of the hall. There were hundreds of guards, of course. But this one wore a scarf around his neck. Some of the others did, but his was more… bulky? Ominous in its bulkiness. An ominous scarf, yes. And the hint of silver hair beneath his helmet. Plenty of Taychendi had silver hair, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knew. This silver hair, though – it made him shiver.\n\nThe guard stepped forwards, out of his position. [Root.Monarch.GetName] paled, felt a wave of sheer incomprehensible terror run down [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spine. The other guards were looking at him now too, though the attendees were still in their cups and plates. The “guard” seized a wine cup from one of the servers next to him. Raised it up high. Then smiled.\n\nA flash of light. An explosion of smoke, steam. The Kamrayakval emerged from the dust. Then chaos. [Root.Monarch.GetName] could barely comprehend what had happened – only that blood and steel and screams and death had consumed the world. The guards and any attendee with a weapon were advancing on the dragon-clad beast in front of them – and Elrandar Silverspite was cutting them down in waves. Eviscerating those who tried to flee, those who tried to stand, those who couldn’t quite make it in time – working his way towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and leaving a bloody trail of mutilated elven bodies in his wake, men and women and guards and nobles and notables and officers and more. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had jerked to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet, pushed the table away from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] – but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] only had the time to utter one command to the guards by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side."
 oren_nayiru.116.a: "“Get me out of here!”"
 oren_nayiru.116.b: "“Everyone, attack!”"
 
 ################################ TAYCHENDI FLAVOUR EVENTS (TAKASAKI) ###################################
 
 # general events

 taychend_flavour.1.t: "Local Warlord Rises"
 taychend_flavour.1.d: "Every Taychendi ruler has warlords who serve under them, ruling their own domains and paying tribute and taxes to their overlord. When not on campaign with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], these local warlords are usually content to see to their own domains, waging petty walls and raids on the warlords surrounding them.\n\nHowever, the warlords of Taychend are ambitious to a fault, and when they see an opportunity for greater power, they take it. Whatever prompted them to believe they could overthrow us is known only to them, but nonetheless, a local warlord has risen up, hoping to take advantage of our low glory and seize power for themselves!"
 taychend_flavour.1.a: "A foolish and fatal mistake!"
 
 taychend_flavour.2.t: "Mercenaries Revolt"
 taychend_flavour.2.d: "While Mercenaries are common to all lands, they take on a slightly more powerful form in Taychend, where might creates right and a helmet and crown are one and the same. Mercenary captains are often “wandering warlords”, with more elves at their command than many cities, and the political power – and mindedness – to match the proudest of sedentary warlord kings.\n\nThey are loyal to coin – but they are not blind to the situation of those who spend it. If they sense weakness, and they believe they can further their position by revolting against their employers, they will do so. Mercenary companies under our employ have raised arms against us, taking advantage of [Root.Monarch.Name]’s low status to attempt to overthrow [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and raise someone more pliable – and generous – to the crown."
 taychend_flavour.2.a: "Pay some of them off."
 taychend_flavour.2.b: "Defeat them on the battlefield."
 taychend_flavour.2.c: "Convince them to stand down."
 
 taychend_flavour.3.t: "Cult of Vherenar Infiltrates Slaves"
 taychend_flavour.3.d: "Founded in the early 14th century by Vherenar Freesword, a Dyami adventurer and abolitionist, the Cult of Vherenar is an incredibly secretive religious brotherhood that has since spread through Taychend like a plague. Dedicated to liberating those in bondage, they have proven a consistent nuisance for many landowners and slavers in Taychend, burrowing into slave populations and creating “cells”, elusive hideouts from which the Cult’s operations are run, within them. It seems a Cult of Vherenar cell has been set up inside one of our cities, and they have been stirring unrest."
 taychend_flavour.3.a: "Hunt them down!"
 taychend_flavour.3.b: "Let them be."
 taychend_flavour.3.c: "Infiltrate and destroy them from the inside."
 
 taychend_flavour.4.t: "Cult of Vherenar Instigates Revolt!"
 taychend_flavour.4.d: "Agents of the Cult of Vherenar, a secretive religious brotherhood dedicated to liberating those in bondage across Taychend, have recently provoked a slave rebellion in our lands, supplying our slaves with weapons and convincing them of the injustice of their position. Already widespread damage has been caused in various provinces of our realm, as masters are killed in their sleep, mines are thrown into chaos and those in bondage rise up against all who have wronged them - this revolt must be dealt with quickly in order for things to be brought under control!"
 taychend_flavour.4.a: "By the gods, think of the economic implications!"
 taychend_flavour.4.b: "Institute harsh reprisals to prevent the revolt spreading."
 
 taychend_flavour.5.t: "Cult of Vherenar Ambushes Caravan"
 taychend_flavour.5.d: "Agents of the Cult of Vherenar, a secretive religious brotherhood dedicated to liberating those in bondage, has recently ambushed and overrun a slave caravan arriving from the western plains of the Guaraddhi, liberating the cargo being transported and executing all of the slavers and their guards. Our inability to protect their cargo has greatly infuriated our merchants and mine-owners, who rely on slaves for many of their commercial endeavours."
 taychend_flavour.5.a: "Don't blame us, there was nothing we could do!"
 taychend_flavour.5.b: "Convince the merchants there was nothing we could do."
 
 taychend_flavour.6.t: "Vassal Warlord Conspires to Steal Land"
 taychend_flavour.6.d: "One might say that there are several “tiers” of warlord in Taychend. Greater warlords dominate smaller warlords, and fight those of a similar size over control of their vassals and territory. To attempt to take on a more powerful warlord on one’s own, or to attack those warlords under one’s direct control and protection, is a foolish idea – though when a warlord-domain grows large and decadent enough, their more tempestuous underlings may attempt to take advantage.\n\nWe have recently discovered that one of our vassals has been plotting to seize several petty city-states under our protection in one swift move, forcing us to accept the new situation as a done-deal. They believe that our state and our ruler are too weak to stop them, and perhaps they are right – but if we want to prevent our vassal increasing their power then we must prevent this scheme immediately."
 taychend_flavour.6.a: "There is nothing we can do."
 taychend_flavour.6.b: "Move to prevent the conquest."
 
 taychend_flavour.7.t: "Bounty of the Kalavend"
 taychend_flavour.7.d: "The Kalavend is the most fertile and heavily populated region in all of South Aelantir, a fact attributable to one thing – the bounty of the river that gives the region its name. Bringing glacial snow melt down from the peaks of the Veyii Sikarha – and, as some myths say, from shifting and transient underground rifts leading to the Plane of Water, the Kalavend river brings great fertility in normal times.\n\nWhen the Storm-Serpents fly high however, and the region is blessed with exceptional rain, the river bursts its banks, flooding parts of the region but depositing even more fertile sediment through the plains and farmlands of the region. This has happened recently, and though many areas have been devastated by the floods, the next few harvests are sure to be very productive indeed."
 taychend_flavour.7.a: "Fantastic!"
 
 taychend_flavour.8.t: "Warlords Flock to Ruler's Banner"
 taychend_flavour.8.d: "There are innumerable petty warlords in Taychend, either controlling humble realms from town sized city-states or commanding wandering mercenary bands, who between them control tens of thousands of soldiers. These petty warlords are often content to fight amongst themselves, but when they see a promising chance for greater glory they will take it. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rising star has attracted many such warlords from across Taychend, eager to leech off the back of our success for greater glory and power. While most of these warlords are of the standard type, ambitious and foolhardy but ultimately pious and honourable Taychendi, there are also undoubtedly some disreputable figures among their ranks, that we may do well to leave behind."
 taychend_flavour.8.a: "Take only those with renown."
 taychend_flavour.8.b: "Take everyone willing to join us."
 taychend_flavour.8.c: "Disreputable? As if any fiends or rogues would want to join me!"
 
 taychend_flavour.9.t: "Beggar, Soldier, Warlord"
 taychend_flavour.9.d: "While to many the promise of rising to the heights of glory proves illusionary, there are a select few who embody the words of priests and the dreams of Taychendi children. One individual’s unyielding determination and tenacity, considerable skill, and touch of good fortune, has seen them rise from a poor beggar to a warlord's levy and finally a warlord themselves under our employ. Though the elf and their soldiers serve us faithfully, there are some who look upon their rising star and wonder if he could not be more useful to us."
 taychend_flavour.9.a: "Give them a general’s command!"
 
 taychend_flavour.10.t: "The Law Code of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 taychend_flavour.10.d: "In Taychend, Law is justified by the very means through it is enforced – force. "Might creates right," as the saying goes. Naturally, this means law-making power in a territory is within the hands of the warlord who controls it. As a result Taychend is a patchwork mess of different laws and legal traditions, making any attempt by a Warlord-King to impose their own new law codes destabilising. Nonetheless, promulgating a new law code can be a powerful tool in setting a tone for one's reign, and expanding one's power - no wonder then that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], undoubtedly a ruler with the requisite skills and might, has become interested in doing so."
 taychend_flavour.10.a: "Promulgate a strict law code."
 taychend_flavour.10.b: "Promulgate a reformist law code."
 taychend_flavour.10.c: "Promulgate an enriching law code."
 taychend_flavour.10.d: "There is no need."
 
 taychend_flavour.11.t: "A Little Liquid Glory"
 taychend_flavour.11.d: "Be it imported from the vineyards of Paraidár or Ameion, or brought all the way over from Alecand, Kheionai wine has been known across Taychend since the beginning of Kheionai-Taychendi trade in the 700sAA. While traditionalists decry the drink as a sign of foreign, western decadence, favouring native Taychendi alcohol like Lelivazha or Pheni, most Taychendi just can't get enough of the fruit of the vine.\n\nWith relations between east and west souring since the invasion of Laskaris the Conqueror, there has been a growing movement to expand Taychend’s fledgeling vineyards, limited now to the southern coast, in order to meet the demand of the Taychendi market without relying on the Kheionai. Others favour importing more wine regardless (which will undoubtedly hurt our trade balance), while others still advocate promoting the producers of Taychendi alcohol."
 taychend_flavour.11.a: "Import more Kheionai wine."
 taychend_flavour.11.b: "Build vineyards over some of our tea plantations."
 taychend_flavour.11.c: "Sponsor a movement in favour of traditional drinks."
 
 taychend_flavour.110.t: "Native Vineyards Thriving"
 taychend_flavour.110.d: "It has been many years since we first began cultivating imported Kheionai grapes in Taychend. It has been a difficult process, filled with many setbacks, trials and tribulations, but each new problem has taught us a new solution, and at last we can truly say that we have learnt the art of viticulture. Our vineyards are now thriving, selling native Taychendi wine across our lands, helping our balance of trade and stoking a sense of national pride - at last, we have beaten the ever-smug Kheionai at their own game!"
 taychend_flavour.110.a: "I think I fancy a glass of Taychendi red!"
 
 taychend_flavour.12.t: "Peasants Move Into Devastated Areas"
 taychend_flavour.12.d: "Most of Taychend's rural population are free peasants, and without any restrictions to mobility like Ameion-imposed serfdom, they are able and willing to migrate away from their homes in search of a better life, especially when their homes and communities become overcrowded. Oftentimes, their destinations are areas recently devastated by war, where land and resources are ripe for the taking and the original inhabitants are generally thankful for the help – or too weakened to resist their migration. Recently, one such migration has taken place, with people moving into recently ravaged parts of our domain."
 taychend_flavour.12.a: "Good for them!"
 
 # slave warren expedition events
 
 taychend_flavour.13.t: "Old Slave Warrens Uncovered!"
 taychend_flavour.13.d: "Before the ruin, the Precursor Slaver-Nobles of Taychend held masses of time-indentured slaves, who worked in deplorable conditions in the hope of receiving a massive reward at the end of their 5,000 year tenure. With the nobles not wanting to sully the pristine Taychendi landscape with shack housing for their slaves, they forced them to live underground in vast, winding slave warrens. Our scavengers have recently uncovered an entrance to a hitherto unknown warren - while dangerous to explore, these warrens could potentially hold valuable relics from the precursor period."
 taychend_flavour.13.a: "Send an expedition down there."
 taychend_flavour.13.b: "Send a heavily armed expedition."
 taychend_flavour.13.c: "Explore using Kotakompu."
 taychend_flavour.13.the: "Don't bother."
 
 taychend_flavour.14.t: "Warren Expedition Destroyed"
 taychend_flavour.14.da: "Scorn of the Kotakompu Queen!\n\nThere is indeed no greater fury than a woman scorned – especially if that woman is a Kotakompu! While our expedition was exploring the Slave Warren, they unfortunately discovered that a very large, very prickly Kotakompu queen, alongside hundreds of her underlings, had made her home within the ruins.\n\nRather than escape and try to call for reinforcements, our expeditionaries rushed in, believing the giant rats to be no more than a nuisance. Unfortunately, they soon discovered what so many others had – the Kotakompu are not called “sickle-teeth” for no reason! Swarmed and surrounded, our expedition was nearly entirely wiped out, with only a few lucky elves living to tell the tale. If we want to explore the ruins again, we will need to send another expeditionary force down there."
 taychend_flavour.14.db: "Armadillos attack!\n\nAs big as an elven adult, with a steel-like-shell and scythe-like-claws, the Giant-Digger-Armadillo is a fearsome and generally elusive beast. Unfortunately, it is generally so elusive that many scavengers disregard it as a threat, a tall tale. Even more unfortunately, it is only “generally” elusive, and Precursor Slave-Warrens, as our warren expedition has found out, are a habitat in which the Giant Armadillos of Taychend live in abundance.\n\nOur expedition was exploring the ruins when they heard rapid tunnelling beyond the walls – soon, they were beset on all sides by the digger armadillos. With their powerful claws, the enemy rent the flesh of our soldiers and dropped the very earth on them, weakening the walls of the ruins in order to bury our expeditionaries, then digging them out and finishing them off. Only a few lucky elves lived to tell the tale. If we want to explore the ruins again, we will need to send another expeditionary force down there."
 taychend_flavour.14.dd: "Cave In!\n\nIt has been a millennium and a half since the Ruin, when most of the slave warrens’ inhabitants abandoned their former living quarters in search of food and resources above ground. No wonder then that with many of their entrances already covered up by deposited dirt and debris and collapsed rooms and tunnels being common, most slave warrens aren’t structurally sound.\n\nAs our expeditionaries were advancing through a long tunnel in one of the slave warrens, the roof suddenly came down on their heads, burying the vast majority of the expedition under several tons of rock and dirt. Only a few elves were fortunate enough to avoid being caught in the collapse – too few to help most of those trapped. Should we send another expedition down, we can most likely excavate through the collapsed tunnel and reach the rest of the ruins, though it will be costly."
 taychend_flavour.14.de: "Embers of Urazhil!\n\nUrazhil the Lifetwister, a name that would strike fear into the hearts of any Taychendi. In the 1100s, while Gophira and Oremvand struggled for dominance in the south, Urazhil the Lifetwister seized control of Katelperai and invaded the Kalavend using monstrous necromantic abominations. Though he was defeated, his followers escaped his demise, and in the ensuing centuries have continued his work in whatever dark dens they can find, away from prying eyes.\n\nAs it turns out, one of these dark dens happened to be the very slave warren we were exploring, our expeditionaries happening on a grim laboratory, where the Cult of Urazhil had been experimenting with all sorts of unsavoury dark magic – dark magic that they then turned on our soldiers. Only a single elf survived the encounter, escaping unnoticed. He reports that the Cult had seemingly not been interested in looting much of the ruins, merely discarding whatever things they had found in a side chamber. If we send another expedition, we may be able to wipe out these cultists and explore the rest of the warren."
 taychend_flavour.14.df: "Charge of the Challúmata!\n\n The Challúmata are feared automatons that patrol the Precursor Ruins of Andeios in service of their long dead masters. Orichalchum statues animated by infused animal souls, protected and enhanced through enchantments, they are given strict, unbreakable orders they follow for all eternity. Though Orichalchum is less durable than even standard bronze, solid metal is solid metal regardless, and any being wielding a spear and shield, or else moulded into the shape of a bull or bear, can be a fiend in a fight. When our expeditionaries were delving into the slave warren, they came across many humanoid Challúmata, moulded in the shape of elven soldiers. They held these off well enough, bringing many low – but when a Challúmata in the shape of a raging bull burst through an unseen door and attacked them from behind, drawn to its “comrades” by the clash of metal on metal, the expedition was destroyed. Only a few lucky elves lived to tell the tale. Now that we know what to expect, our next expedition will likely be much more successful, though it will still be costly."
 taychend_flavour.14.a: "Send another expedition down there."
 taychend_flavour.14.b: "Send another heavily armed expedition."
 taychend_flavour.14.c: "Explore using Kotakompu again."
 taychend_flavour.14.the: "It’s not worth the effort."
 
 taychend_flavour.15.t: "Warren Expedition Finds Nothing"
 taychend_flavour.15.d: "Despite the tales of buried treasure and hidden riches, one must remember what the old slave warrens were built for – to house slaves, deprived of anything remotely worthwhile. Most of the treasure that is found in slave warrens is there because after the Ruin, the revolting slaves seized much of their masters’ wealth and hid it below ground, in order to protect it from roving bandits or the ravages of war. In places where that did not happen, the ruins are likely to be just as destitute as their former inhabitants were.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the case with our recent warren expedition – despite searching high and low, and excavating several collapsed sections of the ruins, they have not found anything of value. It seems the venture is a failure."
 taychend_flavour.15.a: "A waste of time and money..."
 
 taychend_flavour.16.t: "Warren Expedition Yields Results"
 taychend_flavour.16.d: "After the Ruin, the revolting slaves turned on the Slaver-Nobles, slaying most of them and seizing their goods. Hoping to hide their new riches from roving bands of bandits and the first ambitious warlords, they hid them in the very warrens they used to live in, before collapsing their entrances, hoping to return later and reclaim their goods.\n\nSome slaves failed in their revolts, or actually did return to pick the warrens clean – luckily for us, that was not the fate of the warren to which we recently launched an expedition. Our venture has retrieved many priceless artefacts, Precursor armour and weapons, and even some magical relics from the ruins. They will surely fetch a high price on the market."
 taychend_flavour.16.a: "Good news!"
 
 taychend_flavour.17.t: "Warren Expedition Finds Massive Ruin!"
 taychend_flavour.17.d: "The Slaver-Nobles had many secrets, and be they rivals among their own class, or imperial agents looking on with suspicion from Tacenie, there were many prying eyes eager to uncover them. As a result, the Slaver-Nobles invested heavily in underground facilities and storage areas, hidden in the depths of their domains, where they could embark on whatever twisted project they so desired.\n\nSometimes, they hid these ruins in their own slave warrens, concealed behind false walls and shadow veils. Luckily for us, the illusion and abjuration magic that once protected these hidden entrances has worn thin since the Ruin, and on our recent warren expedition we stumbled on a massive underground ruin.\n\nAn extensive underground facility, with many store rooms and hidden chambers, it is a veritable treasure trove of Precursor artefacts, unmolested by the ravages of time. It will take years to fully clear these ruins out, and scrap them for the valuable Precursor steel that has kept them stable for so long."
 taychend_flavour.17.a: "Riches beyond imagining!"
 
 # relic lord events
 
 taychend_flavour.18.t: "Powerful Relic Found"
 taychend_flavour.18.d: "Though Taychend is an extremely relic rich region, most of the Precursor relics in the region are mundane objects, as powerful magical items were generally limited to the elite Slaver-Noble Class of the Taychendi. With that in mind, however, there are a few relics of power within Taychend, treasured possessions of their precursor creators, that are nearly unmatched in their magical abilities. While not as powerful as the first-rate relics employed by figures such as Ebenanth or Kadradar, we have recently discovered a relic which can provide us with great power. However, it requires someone of great magical ability to wield these artefacts - if our ruler is not one, then we must give it to someone who can use it, which may well be very dangerous for us."
 taychend_flavour.18.a: "Wield it yourself."
 taychend_flavour.18.b: "Give it to a trusted subordinate."
 taychend_flavour.18.c: "Put it on display - it is a favourable omen."
 
 taychend_flavour.19.t: "Relic Lord Rises!"
 taychend_flavour.19.d: "Throughout Taychendi history, power and ambition have come hand in hand – and there is no greater power than the Precursor relics that dot Taychend. Though we thought the mage to whom we gave the powerful relic was trustworthy, it seems that their newfound capabilities have corrupted their heart, and they have now decided to rise up against us, wielding the relic against our armies. Some have suggested our ruler flee, the relic lord sure to defeat us, while others point to the many relic-lords throughout history, such as Kadradar or Veliara, who have been defeated in battle. We may still be able to marshall our resources and resist the traitor."
 taychend_flavour.19.a: "Fight the traitor!"
 taychend_flavour.19.b: "I hear Arpedifér is sunny all year round..."
 
 taychend_flavour.20.t: "Assassination Attempt on the Relic Lord!"
 taychend_flavour.20.d: "Relic Lords are powerful figures in Taychend with a long-earned reputation for being nearly undefeatable in personal combat, and are therefore terrifying figures on the battlefield. Their enemies thus often take to more cowardly means to remove them from power – take Ebenanth for instance, the archetypical Relic-Lord, who was stabbed to death by his traitorous lieutenants.\n\nWith that in mind, it is no wonder someone would make a similar attempt on our own ruler. We have recently suffered a serious assassination attempt, no doubt plotted by a power hungry subordinate or some vengeful enemy of theirs."
 taychend_flavour.20.a: "We can only pray for their survival."
 
 # dey vettaga events
 
 taychend_flavour.21.t: "A Ghost in the Hills"
 taychend_flavour.21.d: "Throughout Taychendi history, one particular monster has struck fear into the hearts of farmers, scavengers and hunters everywhere. A unseen foe, lying in wait in perfect stillness, ready to shed its cover and pounce on an unsuspecting victim: the Dey Vettaga. Larger than a jaguar, the Dey Vettaga has the terrible ability to actively conceal its position, its fur colour shifting to mimic its surroundings, as if the “Ghost-Panther” wasn’t even there in the first place. It can lie still, waiting for prey for days at a time, pouncing on whatever unlucky elf or animal happens to walk by. Few survive being ambushed.\n\nLuckily for the denizens of Taychend at large, the animal is solitary, and limited in range to the forested Iron Hills and the foothills of the Katalmarai. Even then it is rarely sighted. Unluckily for the denizens of [tf_dey_vettaga_prov.GetName], a particularly hungry Dey Vettaga has been stalking the hills around their homes for months now, frequently attacking the locals. It has become dangerous just to walk alone in the countryside – and even small groups have been found eviscerated by the white panther’s claws. If we want life in [tf_dey_vettaga_prov.GetName] to return to normal, this beast will need to be dealt with sooner rather than later. Though it will be costly, hunting the beast will undoubtedly bring us some measure of glory. And, of course, should [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] kill the beast, they will surely be regarded as the greatest living hunter in Taychend…"
 taychend_flavour.21.a: "Hunt the beast personally."
 taychend_flavour.21.b: "Send our soldiers after it."
 taychend_flavour.21.c: "Let the beast hunt as it will."
 
 taychend_flavour.22.t: "Dey Vettaga Kills Our Ruler!"
 taychend_flavour.22.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stalked through the jungle, white-knuckled hands gripping [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear. Blood spatters covered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] armour, and as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heartbeat pounded, the loudest sound in a still forest, a thousand regrets raced through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] should have taken a larger hunting party. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] should have brought those Chendhyans [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] saw on the way here. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] should have taken a mage. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] should have struck the beast when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had the chance – while it was devouring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bodyguard Galinpan. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] should have kept a better grip on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword – shouldn’t have dropped it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] should have retreated after Varamesh died. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] should have never tried to hunt the beast at all.\n\nBut it was too late for that now. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own, far from rescue, with a spear in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand, bloodied armour, and a monster beyond comprehension on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tail. It all made sense now, at the end of everything. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was not hunting the ghost in the hills – it was hunting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] thought [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] heard a faint breath to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] right. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] snapped around, heart catching as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] readied [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear – but there was nothing. There didn’t seem to be anything. But the beast was a ghost – it could hide in plain sight, pounce from anywhere. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped forwards slowly, carefully, one foot in front of the other. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] brought his spear low and began to sweep before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes darting from place to place, hoping to see any sign of disturbance.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s gaze was turned to the left when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] suddenly felt the end of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear dip down. A heartbeat later wood cracked, and the weight lifted. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s eyes snapped back to the now broken spear – and the feline paw laid over the speartip on the ground. The warlord looked up to the Dey Vettaga’s head, as it stared at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], it’s camouflaged coat replaced with a brilliant white, its piercing blue eyes narrowed, its teeth bared. It looked like it was smiling."
 taychend_flavour.22.a: "”Oh.”"
 
 taychend_flavour.23.t: "Dey Vettaga Gets Away!"
 taychend_flavour.23.d: "For months, the soldiers of [Root.GetName] had been prowling the hills of [tf_dey_vettaga_prov.GetName], looking for the beast that had caused so much trouble. For months, patrols were wiped out, villagers kept disappearing, and yet not one elf ever managed to lay eyes on the beast and live.\n\nThe military presence was increased – and still nothing. Desertions began, and stricter discipline was imposed, but to no effect, the harsh measures imposed only leading to our soldiers losing heart in the chase itself. Eventually, the venture proved too costly to continue, and our commanders have recommended we halt the campaign and leave the villagers to their fate. With even the military giving up, there is little reason to ignore that recommendation."
 taychend_flavour.23.a: "To Cerachmanu with the damned thing!"
 
 taychend_flavour.24.t: "Dey Vettaga Slain By Troops!"
 taychend_flavour.24.d: "This morning, the head of a big cat – a VERY big cat – was brought before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], its fur a pure white, and its eyes a piercing damestear-blue. The Dey Vettaga of [tf_dey_vettaga_prov.GetName]. The hunt had been long and arduous, and the casualties… [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not want to think about it. This single beast had claimed hundreds of soldiers, and driven ten times the number it had killed to desert, as elves fled in terror rather than wait to be hunted down and consumed.\n\nThankfully, one of our fallen soldiers managed to nick the beast before it killed him, and after his comrades discovered his corpse, they were able to follow the drip-trail of blood to the beast's lair. Smoking it out by setting fires, they finally cornered and butchered it. The nightmare is over, and [tf_dey_vettaga_prov.GetName] can hopefully get some peace once more."
 taychend_flavour.24.a: "What foul magics created such a monster…"
 
 taychend_flavour.25.t: "Dey Vettaga Slain By Ruler!"
 taychend_flavour.25.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stumbled through the forest trail, clutching [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sabre with white-knuckled hands. Blood was spattered across [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] armour – but it coated the edge of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword as well. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] bodyguards, Galinpan and Varamesh, were dead, but they did not die in vain. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap]’d slashed the beast across the back with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword as it was mauling Galinpan, a sure hit, though it darted away before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could attack again. Injured but not mortally so – but the actual damage didn’t matter. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap]’d hit it, and that meant blood.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] heart pounded as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] searched the forest floor, moving from one blood-specked leaf to the next. It had to be cloaked, its fur invisible – but not untrackable, not anymore. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stopped, tracked the trail with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes but did not move. The blood drops grew heavier as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze followed them – [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had to squint, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could just make out a break in the light foliage that carved the forest floor. The brown of the dirt looked wet, darker than that beneath [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own feet. [Root.Monarch.GetName] silently thanked the gods for his good eyes. Now, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] needed to pray that they granted [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] courage. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] took a deep breath, raised [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sabre, and charged with a cry.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had only made it a few sprinted steps before the Dey Vettaga pounced from its cloaked position. With an ear-splitting roar, the forest in front of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was replaced with white fur and piercing blue eyes and terrible claws. [Root.Monarch.GetName] swung [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword with all the might [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could muster. Slaver-Noble steel flashed – then the beast crashed into the warlord with enough force to barrel [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] over. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finally came to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] senses, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] front was covered in blood – and when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] pushed the Dey Vettaga’s corpse off [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] found the source, as a gaping hole stood where the beasts’s head had once been. [Root.Monarch.GetName] laughed as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] collapsed from the exhaustion. The ghost in the hills had been slain."
 taychend_flavour.25.a: "Glory to [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Ghostslayer!"
 
 # chendhyan events
 
 taychend_flavour.26.t: "Incoming Chendhyan Raid!"
 taychend_flavour.26.d: "To the settled peoples who live on the borders of the Chendhya, raids are a constant fact of life. Whether provoked by Taychendi slave raids, or launched by the Chendhyans to seize resources and disrupt those they see as their mortal enemies, the roar of their feline cavalry is feared by all who live near the steppe, and for good reason.\n\nNonetheless, it is necessary for states to maintain an active posture against Chendhyan raids. By maintaining a strong cavalry force, leading from the front, or by building barrier fortifications in the Guaraddhi or the regions bordering it, a state can more easily resist the raiders of the steppe. For now, however, we must work with what we have – our scouts have detected an incoming Chendhyan raid, and we must decide how best to respond."
 taychend_flavour.26.a: "Attempt to fight it off."
 taychend_flavour.26.b: "Ignore it - raids happen all the time."
 taychend_flavour.26.c: "Pay the Chendhyans off."
 
 taychend_flavour.27.t: "Chendhyan Raid Victorious!"
 taychend_flavour.27.d: "The riders of the steppe are feared for a reason. Despite our best efforts, and the sacrifices of many good people, the Chendhyans overcame our defences and ransacked several towns and settlements. They killed any who resisted, and seized anything of value. Grain, metal goods, pots, cloth and clothes were taken, though the Chendhyans were most zealous about taking anything vaguely resembling weapons or armour, no doubt attempting to “protect themselves” from further reprisal. There is little we can do but rebuild what was lost."
 taychend_flavour.27.a: "Another day on the frontier…"
 
 taychend_flavour.28.t: "Chendhyan Raid Defeated!"
 taychend_flavour.28.d: "”Chendhyans routed – many killed. Total victory!”\n\nSo said the hastily written message, written by the commander of our garrisons on the frontier, that we received earlier today. Further investigation showed all was as they reported – the Chendhyan raid was utterly broken, with their riders routed by our forces’ steadfast defence, and many of their mounts slain. Our own forces took minimal losses compared to them, though there are regardless grieving wives and mothers who will look on this day as a bittersweet victory. Nonetheless, the frontier is secure once more."
 taychend_flavour.28.a: "Hurrah!"
 
 taychend_flavour.29.t: "Chendhyan Incursion!"
 taychend_flavour.29.d: "There are two beliefs that the Chendhyans hold that render them very dangerous to those who live near the Chendhya itself. The first is that the entire steppe ought to belong to them – they have lived off its game and grain since the Ruin, and, to be fair to them, external colonisation is extremely disruptive to their semi-nomadic lifestyle. The second belief is that everyone is out to get them. From the Kheionai to the Taychendi, slavers and invaders lie in every corner, ready to strike.\n\nWith that in mind, its an obvious course of action for them to try and push those invaders off the steppe – a fact that has made life very difficult for those attempting to conquer it. Recently, a Chendhyan warband has attacked our border settlements, hoping to push us out and restore Chendhyan rule to the steppe. We must stop them."
 taychend_flavour.29.a: "Damned pests!"
 
 taychend_flavour.30.t: "Chendhyan Warlord Pledges Service"
 taychend_flavour.30.d: "Like their eastern neighbours, the Chendhyans have always been a bellicose people, waging war, provoked and pre-emptive, in defence of the steppe. Unlike their eastern neighbours, however, they did not wage war for its own sake, always seeking a moral justification – that was, of course, until Ultarlanbeg.\n\nAfter the collapse of his Chendhyan empire, many of those left in Taychend adopted the religious traditions of that land, turning their considerable military skills to the pursuit of glory rather than of security. Since then, wandering Chendhyan warlords have made their names in service to Taychendi rulers – one such warlord has approached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] with such an offer of service."
 taychend_flavour.30.a: "He will be a useful advisor."
 taychend_flavour.30.b: "He will be a useful general."
 taychend_flavour.30.c: "Deny him service!"
 
 taychend_flavour.31.t: "The Remnant Chendhyans"
 taychend_flavour.31.d: "In the 890s, in response to a provocative invasion of their homeland by the Philosopher-King Daratam Threadsworn, a Chendhyan warlord named Ultarlanbeg rose to unite the tribes of the steppe. In a lightning-quick – and incredibly destructive – series of conquests, Ultarlan the Decimator conquered nearly all of Taychend, save the rugged hills of the Advakhalla. Though his empire would collapse during the reign of Ultarlan’s heir, remnant Ezhudars – Chendhyan kingdoms – would dominate Taychend for nearly 50 years.\n\nDespite their destruction at the hand of Olhokar the Fortuitous, and the exile of most Chendhyans back west, some remained in Taychend, defending isolated remnant communities. One of these communities has recently come into conflict with its neighbours, as the local Taychendi nearby blame the Chendhyans for a series of recent destructive conflicts, claiming they instigated a nearby warlord to invade, then did not do enough to stop them. The Chendhyans plead their innocence, but few support them. It is up to us to step in, should we seek to either save them – in which case they will likely offer their military services to us – or defuse the situation by expelling them."
 taychend_flavour.31.a: "The sins of their fathers are not their own."
 taychend_flavour.31.b: "Expel them as penance for their ancestors’ crimes."
 
 taychend_flavour.32.t: "Caergarae Does Surf"
 taychend_flavour.32.da: "The Samidon Trail, a trade route running from Clemetar to Empkeios, has always been extremely lucrative, offering a far shorter nautical route from Taychend to the Kheionai than the southern Path of Wine can offer, the wide Agotham river allowing large ships and barges full of cargo to make the trip south. There is only one problem – the Chendhyans. While the friendly riders of Kaeorg may help guide ships over the Chendhya, the decidedly unfriendly lake-pirates of Caergaraen definitely do not help guide ships over the Taras’su Ervan.\n\nThe Caergarae launch constant raids from their hidden cove-bases along the lakeside, with the pirates taking their feline mounts onto their ships, pouncing onto the decks of trade vessels, and wreaking sheer havoc on those unfortunate enough to meet them. Recently, a particularly loaded convoy was attacked by Caergarae pirates, who made off with their goods, and liberated the slaves on board the ships. While there remain unsubjugated Chendhyans living on the shores of the lake, this situation is likely to continue – much to the annoyance of our merchants and the detriment of our coffers.”

 # sarihaddi events
 
 taychend_flavour.33.t: "Sarihaddi tribe migrates into our territory!"
 taychend_flavour.33.d: "The tribes of the Sarihaddi have made a living in Taychend’s central desert for a thousand years and more, traversing the harsh sands. Having learnt much from their Chendhyan neighbours, they live a somewhat similar semi-nomadic lifestyle, moving between grazing locations with their livestock. When one of their grazing sites is seized by a rival tribe or falls into ruin, however, they often seek to move into new territories, finding greener pastures in the arid fields surrounding the desert.\n\nRecently, one such tribe has migrated into our territory, which has caused tensions with the local populace, culminating in an incident in which some blood was shed (though thankfully nobody was killed). Sensing more trouble on the way, the leaders of the tribe have requested an audience with us in order to plead their case, hoping to come to a lasting settlement regarding their place in the region."
 taychend_flavour.33.a: "Allow them to stay."
 taychend_flavour.33.b: "Kick them out."
 
 taychend_flavour.34.t: "Sarihaddu and Chendhyan tribes squabble!"
 taychend_flavour.34.d: "Sarihaddu and Chendhyan tribes live very similar lifestyles - semi nomads in the dry lands of western Taychend, who move from grazing spot to grazing spot in a  similar cycle each year. Unfortunately for both groups, there are limited grazing spots available, and so they often get into fights with each other over land and resource, despite the efforts of those who would prefer the two groups cooperate.\n\nIn [tf_sarihaddi_squabble_target.GetName], once such struggle has occurred, between two minor tribes of the respective cultures. This dispute has become such a problem that the local elites of the province have asked our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to intervene – we must choose wisely, as this issue has attracted enough attention that our choice will be noticed by the entirety of both groups within our empire."
 taychend_flavour.34.a: "Side with the Chendhyans."
