 #Events
 taychendi.1.t: "Death Of An Ally"
 taychendi.1.d: "Alliances are fickle things in the war torn land of Taychend. Bound by blood and personal relationships rather than treaties, alliances among the Taychendi rulers often end when one of the partners meets their demise. Unfortunately, we just received news of the death of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName]. Thus, our alliance with them has come to an end."
 taychendi.1.a: "A sad day."

 taychendi.2.t: "A Death, A Storm Brewing"
 taychendi.2.d: "Terrible news! The sovereign is dead! This can only bring horrible consequences for our realm. Whoever takes the empty throne must now navigate the fickle and unstable politics involved in the succession of the new monarch. Our provincial governors and local nobility grow disobedient, acting increasingly autonomous from our rule due to the weakness of the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nEven worse, the subject lords have made their move, taking full advantage of the current instability of our realm. They have raised their armies, seeking to gain freedom for themselves. A great storm is coming, we must act quickly."

 tayched_break_alliances: "All of our §YAlliances§! have §Rended§! along with our ruler's reign."

 taychendi.3.d: "Terrible news! The sovereign is dead! This can only bring horrible consequences for our realm. Whoever takes the empty throne must now navigate the fickle and unstable politics involved in the succession of the new monarch. Our provincial governors and local nobility grow disobedient, acting increasingly autonomous from our rule due to the weakness of the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nFortunately, our subjects have yet to show any sign of disloyalty. Whether they are truly loyal, or they have been sufficiently cowed into obedience by our previous lords, our vassals haven’t made a single move since our previous monarch’s death."
 taychendi.3.a: "They have made a wise choice."
 
 taychendi.4.t: "Disorder And Disobedience"
 taychendi.4.d: "Our new sovereign is untested, and is unable to wield the same authority as their predecessor. Local nobility refuse to submit to our rule, and the population grows restless. Our administration has become overburdened, and is unable to properly extract revenue from our lands. We will have to solve this problem, one way or another."

 taychend_do_it_yourself: "§YThis event shall not fire again.§!"
 
 taychendi.5.t: "Buying Boats"
 taychendi.5.d: "The lords of Taychend never bothered much with the sea. They could never afford to, for their rivals on land were always a much bigger threat. Even the lords of Oremvand and Nagyar Vyechei focused their attention on inland matters rather than the lands beyond. Thus, naval affairs were left entirely in the hands of the merchant guilds, who held an exclusive monopoly on shipbuilding techniques and naval expertise.\n\nOur lord has reached out to the merchant guilds, seeking to purchase ships for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fleet. The merchant guilds are happy to accept, on the promise of more favorable treatment by our kingdom."

 taychendi.6.t: "Outraged Enemies Attack Us!"
 taychendi.6.d: "In Taychend, the death of a ruler is always seen as a good opportunity to exploit the weaknesses of an enemy. When those weaknesses are great, the resulting opportunity can be too - and such has occured here. A terrible crisis has befallen our nation, as the death of our previous ruler has given those who despise us the confidence they need to declare war! Woe befalls the land, as every elf knows that dark days are ahead. However, if we can overcome this, we can shatter that false confidence of the enemy, sundering memories of our aggressive expansion alongside it - and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will surely benefit from a glorious victory."
 taychendi.6.a: "A terrible crisis and a terrific opportunity..."
 taychend_coalition_declared_on_ruler_death_tt: "All countries with §G>100§! §YAggressive Expansion§! against us have declared a §GCoalition War§!!"
 
 religious_reforms.6.t: "Taychendi Reform"
 religious_reforms.6.d5: "We have achieved the unthinkable, the impossible. The great cycle of warlordism, which had for so long plagued Taychend since the ruin, has been ended by us. The establishment of a Taychendi empire, centralized, stable, and united. Through the many trials and tribulations we faced, we have managed to form a state that stood firm against all resistance the peoples of Taychend formed against it. Our empire is The Empire of Taychend, and, gods willing, the final empire of Taychend."
 religious_reforms.6.d4: "The peoples of the provinces are not taking the standardization of the Taychendi writing system lying down. Loyalist governors have now started advocating greater autonomy from our rule, and in every sense have turned their backs on our kingdom. It seems as though the homogenizing of the Taychendi script was the final straw for many against our policies of centralization. Our agents report the formation of militias and armies all across the countryside, many organized by our own governors, clearly being used as a sword at our throats. It seems this is the final test, if we can outlast this crisis, Taychend will be ours for the taking."
 religious_reforms.6.d3: "The decision to destroy the autonomy of the cities has caused widespread anger and outrage. Both the urban elites and the urban poor have banded together, our governors and loyal officials having been defenestrated! The city militias have closed the gates to our armies, and now proclaim full independence from our rule! This is a true test of our strength, we must not falter, lest we fall like the empires that came before us."
 religious_reforms.6.d2: "The cults are not pleased with our recent attempts to control them. Already their leaders have begun organizing their members, stocking piling weapons and supplies, and calling upon other cults in our land to do the same. We knew it was not going to be easy to bring the cults to heel, yet it seems we underestimated their true power. We must mobilize the army, as a new period of religious strife is upon us."
 religious_reforms.6.d1: "The replacement of the local lords with loyalists has not gone perfectly, but in the end they all submitted. Our loyalists now rule on the ground, and we can safely say we have control of our own territory now. Still, the reorganization and redistribution of land ownership in our kingdom has caused some instability, but we will recover."
 religious_reforms.6.a: "We will continue with the current course, no matter what resistance we face."
 
 #Flavour Events
 
 taychendi.10.t:0 "The Urban Warlords"
 taychendi.10.d:0 "Since the Ruin, the vast slums of Nanru Nakar have been dominated by “Urban Warlords”, gang leaders who carve their own territory out of the great city. Most of the time they are content to acknowledge the authority of Nanru Nakar’s rulers, and don't cause major disturbances as that would also hinder their own affairs. This is unfortunately no longer the case.\n\nThough the situation is extremely complex, we can surmise that a close relative of the head of one of the biggest criminal groups of [2496.GetName] was found dead - poisoned. The boss, after accusing another urban warlord of the act (the Vettaga Talni, from [2495.GetName]), started an all out war against not only them, but every group they even loosely associated with, and other gangs are starting to join one of the two sides.\n\nThe two districts are now in flames, with a lot of the residents barricaded in their homes, fearing going outside, and many roads already devastated from the fighting. [2497.GetName] is spared, but for how long?"

The gravity of the abuses kept escalating sadly, and in the last couple years it became clear the corp is closer in nature to the gangs it should be fighting than an instrument of the law."

 taychendi.12.t:0 "Philosopher Advocate Kheiosist Principles"
 taychendi.12.d:0 "Since Laskaris the Conqueror invaded Taychend, ideas from the Kheionai’s peculiar religion have begun to influence some of our subjects. An already very famous local scholar is one of these people; he's so taken with their ideas that he has started advocating embracing some of them - the so-called Axierophonic Mandate - in our state.\nThe war weariness of our population made his ideas quickly very popular, the military purpose being the security of the people (instead of a tool for the ruler's own personal glory) chiefly amongst them. Some of our subject even went as far as proclaiming they'd rather follow the heathens philosophies than our Cults."

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] asks too much; I grant it not. For as long as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will live, [prophecy_vassal.GetName] will stand tall."\n\nThe augury is spreading like wildfire; many in the court believe we should listen to the oracle and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s advisors counsel is to stop the integration, at least for now.\nIn our vassal's lands everyone, from peasant to warlord, is questioning [Root.Monarch.GetName] right to rule them when even the gods are against it."

 #Oren Nayiru Events

 oren_nayiru.1.t: "First Contact"
 oren_nayiru.1.d: "The Ruin was an event shrouded in hundreds of myths and legends, an episode of violence, upheaval, and environmental devastation that heralded the doom of the immortal Slaver-Nobles who once ruled Taychend. One particular story, however, details a great exodus along a newly sunken coast, as any elf who could took flight on any vessels that survived the great floods. Knowledgeable folk thought those who fled dead, a sign of the dangers that would overcome you when you sailed far out to sea. They were wrong.

 oren_nayiru.5.d: "The imposition of serfdom has been a vital part of the “Kheionisation” process, as Ameion turns the free and mobile Taychendi peasantry into serfs tied to the land they work on. It has done wonders to prevent warlordism, and facilitate a turn away from the extensive slavery that has underpinned the Taychendi economy for so long. It has also been one of the largest contributing factors to opposition against Kheionai rule. With the Oren Nayiru promising freedom and independence, the Taychendi serfs of Ameion have flocked to them in great numbers – unless we deploy forceful measures to stem the spread of this new faith, it is likely we may continue to lose more of our subjects to this rebellious religion."

They have done great damage to the trade, and the economic elites of our country are becoming increasingly frustrated at our inability to do anything to stop them – they demand an immediate crackdown on the Oren Nayiru. Though this is unlikely to stop the raids entirely, and these measures are always extremely destructive, it may heavily damage the faith’s power base."

Thanks to the recent assassination of a prominent figure, a wave of, frankly, justified paranoia has spread across the realm.

 oren_nayiru.10.d: "Most slaves, naturally, crave freedom – and the Oren Nayiru has given them an unprecedented opportunity to realise that. Utilising the extensive resources of the faith, many slaves have escaped bondage and formed maroon communities in the many hills of Taychend, defending their freedom with their lives and launching raids of liberation and vengeance from their hill-top communities. Breaking these entrenched communities is extremely costly in blood and treasure, but if we are to retain control of our land it is nonetheless extremely important."

The discovery of one of these cells, therefore, is a veritable coup for our nation’s security.\n\nThis is not likely to be easy, and it will certainly trigger a wider uprising by the faith, but by launching an all out attack on this location, we can greatly disrupt the Oren Nayiru as a whole and set the movement back greatly."

Their message has a broad appeal, and the actual centres of their faith are extremely elusive, and when uncovered prove to be well fortified on top of that.\n\nWhile one group proposes that we attempt to use reason to convince converts away from the Oren Nayiru – a strategy that is likely to be more time consuming and expensive – there are many, particularly among the landowners of the countryside, who propose that we use extensive violence to persecute the faith.\n\nBy burning out the traitors who have converted, in the fields or in the slave pens and mines, we can cut back on the Oren Nayiru’s power base and expose them to further attacks. This, however, is likely to cause widespread devastation. Ultimately, the choice is [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s to make."

They came from every corner of Taychend, some even further beyond, fought for glory or fortune or adventure, or because it was simply all they knew. The captain turned his gaze to the black-iron collar in his hand once again – why did he fight? Why did he command, lead?\n\nAn elven woman spoke from behind him. Silverspite turned to see his second in command, his Velara. “You won’t know until you use it,” she said, a grave look on her face that matched Silverspite’s own. The steel mask he usually wore was wracked with doubt, worry, desperate hope. He turned back to the sun, wished that it would give its light just a little longer.\n\nSilverspite had found the collar when he went to fetch water, on a skeleton in a stream – the simple ring of iron had radiated a power so awesome the mercenary could feel it in his heart. Purpose, he knew, was nothing without power. His father was a Sun Elven Exemplar, as was Velara before she turned her cloak. They espoused a glorious purpose, to vanquish the dark – but they were powerless against it. Darkness – weakness – infected their hearts, blinded them. It had led his father to abandon his Taychendi mother, left her stranded in the shadow of their great crusades. Eventually, the darkness had consumed her too.\n\nThe mercenary would not let it do the same to him. He would not let his own purpose, his own destiny, whatever it was, wither in the dark. He unclasped the back of the collar, snapped it around his neck. A moment of nothing, then radiant, brilliant light, then an explosion of roiling steam and smoke. It consumed the mercenary, raising an alarm through Velara and any others nearby – but soon enough a figure emerged, clad in a suit of hulking, jagged armour, of black-iron scales interwoven with steel-like-plate, a dragon in armour form. Before them, Elrandar Silverspite stood, clad in the Armour of Yodhan. In Sedamurax, the Iron Maw. Beneath the visor, the mercenary smiled."

 oren_nayiru.101.t: "A Meeting in the Dark"
 oren_nayiru.101.d: "An armoured Silverspite stood straight as the High Kavalali of Uesrennu circled him. The leaders of the Oren Nayiru, the failure of the Calsithara Revolt had hardened them – while many in the faith cried out for revolution, the High Kavalali urged moderation. The Uesrennu High Kavalali were the last refuge of a more bellicose position – but even they had their doubts. And so, for the last week, they had been testing Silverspite. First, his capabilities. He had the strength of fifty men, durability beyond precursor steel, and above all control over gravity itself. In emulation of dragonflight, he could soar through the air at terminal velocity, a single spinning charge with his twin blades devastating an entire battleline. He had power – he could destroy armies single handedly –  so they tested his purpose.\n\n“And you know of the tenets, of the proclamations of the Kavalali?” asked one. “You admit to the principle of deliberation, of decision by many, not one?” Asked another. “You decry the tyrant kings of ages past – you would not rule as Yodhan did, would you?” “Have you decried the Kheionai too?” “You must!”\nSilverspite batted their accusations away. “I know the tenets.” He replied. His voice was clear, ever-serious, nearly emotionless. “I would act as the leader of the faith, not as a tyrant.” “Not as Yodhan but as Kamrayakval.” “The Kheionai are as tyrannical as the rest. They need to be taught the truth of Nayiru.” The questions ceased, as the Kavalali regarded Silverspite. They were still hesitant. “Disunity is what caused Calsithara’s efforts to fail.” Silverspite said, breaking the silence. “If the most important cells named me Kamrayakval, the entire faith will support me. I know it.”\nFinally, one among them – the most senior – spoke. “The entire faith, yes. But before you found that armour, you were a mere mercenary,” the High Kavalal said, a cold expression on his face. “So I must ask, are you a member of the faith… Elrandar Kalinzuir?”\n\nSilverspite’s eyes narrowed beneath his helmet, as the mention of his father’s name made him grimace. A note of inexplicable fear struck those in the room – the guards drew their sabres. “I believe,” Silverspite said, every word considered, “In the will of Nayiru. My father called him Surael. It is said, across the sea, Nayiru sent another warrior to liberate the land from darkness. You may doubt me now, but when I rise, High Kavalal, and Dawn furrows Taychend’s fields with the blood of its enemies? You will see what Surael’s Champion truly looks like. Here I stand. Will you rise with me, or remain in the dark?"
 oren_nayiru.101.a: "Within the hour, the Uesrennu Kavalali agree to support Silverspite’s claim"

 oren_nayiru.102.t: "Eclipse"
 oren_nayiru.102.d: "Silverspite knelt before the High Kavalali, as a crowd 100,000 strong surrounded them.  As foreseen, an eclipse set in, and the world darkened. After two years of political wrangling, the faith was finally united. A representative of each of the most powerful cells held a crown together above his head – they spoke in turn. “In the name of Nayiru”, said Uesrennu’s High Kavalal. “We charge you,” said Katelperai’s. “To lead our armies,” said Clematar. “And guide our faith,” Nagar Vyechei. “From this day,” Gophira. “To your final day,” Sthanan. “A sword of dawn,” Rakkabuttai, “A voice of reason,” Royakottar. Nakar Kilaeik, Kriadvai, then Mlerek took one word each. “As.” “Our.” “Kamrayakval.”\n\nAt total eclipse, the High Kavalali, as one, lowered the crown onto Silverspite’s head. The Kamrayakval rose, a dragon in armour-form. The crowd was silent as half watched the blackened sun and the rest his blackened armour. The Kamrayakval searched the crowd for a moment, gave his mercenary company a nod, then began his speech. “Five Cycles, we have lived in darkness. Cast into it by the Kheionai, the warlords, the Slaver-Nobles, by the very dragons I’m wearing on my back!” Silverspite unsheathed his sword. “But that ends today! It ends here! It ends when we rise and conquer the world like sun conquers night!” Anger crept into his voice – Silverspite caught it, then harnessed it. “Everyone here! Everyone who takes up the black banner of the Dawn! We are ALL born with purpose. To bring light to dark! To furrow the fields with the blood of the warlords and the tyrants, the slavers and the invaders! We bore that purpose, but for hundreds of thousands of years and more we have been weak! Weak! Well no more! Because now, we are powerful! Because now I am here and I AM POWER! So follow me, brothers, sisters! Give your lives and your blood for DAWN! And to any who oppose us, who stand in our way, to the darkness and its soldiers, I DECLARE WAR! WAR FOR THE DEATH OF DARKNESS! WAR FOR DAWN!”\n\nAs Silverspite thrust his blade to the eclipse, the sun began to emerge from behind the moon’s shadow. The crowd was silent for a short moment – then an elf in the crowd called “War!” A second pause, then “WAR!” came the cry of the crowd. “WAR!” The Oren Nayiru thrust fists and sabres and muskets and spears into the air, and “WAR!” echoed the declaration, for the gods, for Nayiru himself to hear. “WAR!” “WAR!” “WAR!” “WAR!” “WAR!”"

 oren_nayiru.103.d: "Silverspite twirled the twin blades in his hands over in a practised motion. He crouched in a tree line to the right of the battlefield, watching as his formation halted before the enemy ranks – began to exchange fire. The last battle of the war. Volley and countervolley devastated both sides – though his own forces were seeing the worse of it. No matter. Let them die – he’d repay it in kind, twice over and more. The Kamrayakval took a deep breath, rose, then felt his stomach turn as gravity itself turned upside-down. The sight of battle became the sight of leaves and branches, then open sky. He knew the enemy saw him, a dark star rising against the blue of day.\n\nThe Kamrayakval picked up speed as he ascended, tumbling into a ball – then he turned the world again. Aimed himself at the enemy battleline. Dived. Faster yet faster, he picked up speed and strength and sheer velocity. The wind whipped through him, plate turning red with heat. Silverspite stretched out his arms, sabres flashing, then twisted his body into a controlled spin. He glimpsed the enemy break at his descent. It didn’t matter. When he neared the ground, he turned gravity once more, then again, up to slow his fall then forwards to propel him into a charge.\n\nContact. He heard screams, frantic shouting. Saw limbs and guts and heads and gore fly as he eviscerated his way through the enemy line at terminal velocity, a whirlwind of death, unstoppable, invincible. Blood splashed against his visor, his armour, but he didn’t need to see to destroy. His blades hungered, and so the Dragon consumed.\n\nHe turned gravity up, then down, then up, rising into the air in a controlled ascent, blades like wings as he spread his arms to slow his upwards fall. He saw through bloodied eyes the remains of his charge. How many had he killed? Thousands? Tens of thousands? His soldiers surged forwards, charging over a field of broken corpses, of mutilated bodies, elves dead or wishing they were. Silverspite smiled, aimed his body at the fleeing enemy, then turned gravity again. The Kamrayakval’s War was over. He had won."

 oren_nayiru.104.t: "Kamrayakval Defeated"
 oren_nayiru.104.d: "Silverspite stared blankly ahead as he slumped back in his shattered throne. The throne room was cannon-scarred, crumbling. They’d be in here soon, the full force of his enemies. So be it. This would be his grave – but he would not go without a fight. The Kamrayakval stood, grabbed the twin blades by his side. He felt the dragon lash out within him, the anger and spite and wrath and rage and ruin threatening to burst and consume everything around him – but he pushed it back down, for now. For now.\nThey surged through every entrance they could find or make. Some even dropped down through the ceiling. Storms of soldiers, each clutching muskets or sabres or spears, some mages, some heavily armoured, most conscripts. It mattered little what they were, of course – when Silverspite lunged forwards with the force of gravity behind him, elven bodies turned to mutilated gore all the same.\nThe Kamrayakval cut and slashed and charged and rent flesh and steel and bone. Waves of men fell at his swords – when one snapped, he picked up another from the dead and kept fighting, kept moving forwards, kept up the relentless flashing whirlwind of death, the slaughter and the ruin. He felt magefire and musketballs and arrow and quarrel pelt him – some made it through, tore through his body. Still, he kept fighting. The rage boiled over, now – he could feel himself slipping, losing himself. To the dragon, to bloodlust, to spite. He was only half aware of how he roared, how he raged.\nHe had to cut himself free multiple times, when his limbs snared themselves in gore and guts. The blood blinded him. The fire burned him. Still he fought on. Still, he killed. Still, Silverspite stood. In spite of those who doubted him, in spite of those who had betrayed him, in spite of those who had destroyed him.\nBy the time the dragon took over, Silverspite was already a dead elf walking. He bled from a dozen wounds, bones broken and scarred by fire. He was barely conscious when he found himself bursting through the roof of the throne room, into the sky above, falling upwards, then into an uncontrolled spin, away, away, then crashing into a nearby river, bathed in orange by the setting sun. He felt the water rushing into his armour – felt it burn his lungs. Then dusk, and everything went dark."
 oren_nayiru.104.a: "They never found his body, nor the armour. His war was over"

 oren_nayiru.105.t: "The Sinews of War"
 oren_nayiru.105.d: "The Oren Nayiru, being hyper-radical zealots they are, call for essentially the complete restructuring of society, including wide-scale economic reform, a process that will undoubtedly leave most of Taychend’s wealthy mercantile elite destitute – or worse, dead. It is no surprise, then, that the rich merchant houses, traders, caravaneers and slavers have thrown their lot in with the forces battling the Kamrayakval, and have sent us considerable funds for the war effort."
 oren_nayiru.105.a: "Splendid news!"

 oren_nayiru.106.t: "Elites Rally!"
 oren_nayiru.106.d: "When the Kamrayakval declared war on Taychend, one of his very explicit targets were the warlords who still remained in control of much of the region. While he has since taken some of those warlords under his banner – provided they offer at least a semi-earnest conversion to his faith, of course – the banners of Orenvalyam have nonetheless presented an existential threat to the landowners and warlords arrayed against them. With that in mind, they have pledged men and resources to our cause, so we can put down the Kamrayakval together."
 oren_nayiru.106.a: "Fantastic news!"

 oren_nayiru.107.t: "Slaves No More!"
 oren_nayiru.107.d: "To claim that the institution of slavery has done more to fill the Oren Nayiru’s ranks than any other factor is to state the obvious. Growing as it did from a religious brotherhood specifically dedicated to vanquishing it, the Kamrayakval’s forces have been swelled with masses of freed slaves, and the Oren Nayiru have, obviously, made a point of freeing any of those they come across.\n\nThis has also resulted in significant unrest within our own slave stock – in [oren_nayiru_slave_revolt.GetName], the slaves have risen up against their masters, pledged support for Silverspite, and caused significant damage while doing so."
 oren_nayiru.107.a: "Why can’t a slave ever just learn their place?"

 oren_nayiru.108.t: "Warlord Defections!"
 oren_nayiru.108.d: "Taychendi warlords are notorious for following whichever way the wind is blowing. A single lost battle is often followed by a wave of defections, as warlords seek power at the side of those most likely to hold it. Though we continue to resist him, the Kamrayakval has won many, many battles, and those warlords who fight for us are increasingly leaving our employ to join him, in return for simple oaths of loyalty, and paper-conversions."
 oren_nayiru.108.a: "Cowards, the lot of them!"

 oren_nayiru.109.t: "In the Name of Nayiru"
 oren_nayiru.109.d: "When the Kamrayakval declared war under the eclipse, he called on his faithful to kill the servants of darkness, and furrow the fields with their blood. HIs forces have taken that message to heart. Across Silverspite’s new territories, the banners of the Oren Nayiru put enemies and unbelievers to the sword. Though the Kamrayakval has attempted – half-heartedly, in many cases – to reign in the excesses of his troops, this has done very little, and sword-point conversions have become extremely common."
 oren_nayiru.109.a: "What else would we expect from these madmen?"

 oren_nayiru.110.t: "Silverspite Storms a Fort!"
 oren_nayiru.110.d: "There are countless myths and half-lost historical records detailing the Armour of Yodhan’s capabilities on the battlefield. For centuries, they were thought by learned elves to be mere fiction. Unfortunately for the enemies of Elrandar Silverspite, they have been proven wrong again and again and again.\n\nAnd unfortunately for the garrison of [silverspite_sieges_fort.GetName], Elrandar Silverspite’s incredible power has been levied against them. Like a hurricane of flashing steel and dragon-scale plate, the Kamrayakval descended on the fort from above and effectively annihilated the garrison, cutting down all those who didn’t surrender, his infamous twin blades rending flesh and steel alike."
 oren_nayiru.110.a: "Why couldn’t he have found some normal relic in that stream?"

 oren_nayiru.1100.t: "Silverspite Storms a Fort!" #(Orenvalyam Version)
 oren_nayiru.1100.d: "There are countless myths and half-lost historical records detailing the Armour of Yodhan’s capabilities on the battlefield. For centuries, they were thought by learned elves to be mere fiction. Unfortunately for the enemies of Elrandar Silverspite, they have been proven wrong again and again and again.\n\nAnd unfortunately for the garrison of [silverspite_sieges_fort.GetName], Elrandar Silverspite’s incredible power has been levied against them. Like a hurricane of flashing steel and dragon-scale plate, the Kamrayakval descended on the fort from above and effectively annihilated the garrison, cutting down all those who didn’t surrender, his infamous twin blades rending flesh and steel alike."
 oren_nayiru.1100.a: "Why couldn’t he have found some normal relic in that stream?"

 oren_nayiru.111.t: "Ruthless Repression"
 oren_nayiru.111.d: "Though the Oren Nayiru claim to fight for the dawn, they thrive in the darkness. They hide among the peasantry and slaves and serfs, in the hills and forests, within fields of maize and rows of slum housing. In an effort to flush the Oren Nayiru out, and re-establish supremacy, our forces have recently set some of our lands aflame – and committed a variety of unspeakable atrocities in the process."
 oren_nayiru.111.a: "Like follows like, and the cycle continues"

 oren_nayiru.112.t: "The Grip of Famine"
 oren_nayiru.112.d: "Taychend’s food security is notoriously non-existant. Though the land itself is impressively fertile, even relatively minor conflicts have a tendency to cause great damage to cultivation efforts, usually thanks to the deaths of those trying to do the cultivating. The Kamrayakval’s War is not a minor conflict.\n\nWith much of the day-to-day fighting occurring in the countryside, as peasants and escaped slaves clash with warlords and soldiers who have become very well-acquainted with the use of fire, it has caused an incredible amount of damage to the region’s agricultural base. Famine has set in rapidly and indiscriminately."
 oren_nayiru.112.a: "After this is over, we may well rule over a realm of corpses."

 oren_nayiru.113.t: "Fotistrépei Fight to the End!"
 oren_nayiru.113.d: "The Fotistrépei, those Taychendi who have become Kheionised soldiers under Ameion’s employ, are not well loved by the Oren Nayiru. Widely seen as traitors to their Taychendi roots, they are also despised for their significant role in putting down native Taychenid rebellions, no matter their religious affiliation – as a result, the Kamrayakval’s forces have taken to showing no quarter to the Fotistrépei when they find them.\n\nThis has had a significant impact on the Fotistrépei – knowing they will find no quarter on the battlefield, and fearing repercussions for their families should the Kamrayakval emerge victorious, the vast majority of the auxiliary corps has committed themselves completely to the Anti-Orenvalyam cause, determined to never surrender nor retreat in battle without exacting an equal toll on the Oren Nayiru.\n\nThe phrase “Fotistrépei fight to the end!” has become a rallying cry both on and off the battlefield. if we are to crush Silverspite’s rebellion, we will undoubtedly need to utilise their power."
 oren_nayiru.113.a: "Their loyalty will be rewarded – and remembered!"

 oren_nayiru.114.t: "Our People Massacred!"
 oren_nayiru.114.d: "Naturally, the Oren Nayiru despise the Kheionai, seeing them as foreign invaders exploiting Taychend’s land and people and destroying Taychendi culture. The Klereyen, those Taychendi who have converted to the Kheionai ways, are despised even more, seen as traitors.\n\nWith the Kamrayakval sweeping over Taychend, his forces have developed a habit of mistreating – and massacring – any Kheionai and Klereyen civilians they can get their hands on. Though he has issued orders to stop any “targeted” violence, it has done little to stem the tide of atrocities, and recently a particularly vicious attack caused widespread devastation in some of our provinces."
 oren_nayiru.114.a: "The Barbhen show their true colours!"

 oren_nayiru.115.t: "Taychendi Serfs Defect!"
 oren_nayiru.115.d: "Ameion’s imposition of serfdom on the Taychendi – often framed as a “moral alternative to slavery” – has likely been one of the greatest sources of discontent among the empire’s subjugated peoples. Their much coveted freedom restricted, the peasantry fell into the arms of the Oren Nayiru, who they believed could provide the organisation they need to throw off Ambhen domination – recently, a wave of serf rebellions has erupted, with the rebels declaring in favour of the Kamrayakval"
 oren_nayiru.115.a: "A foreseeable disaster"

 oren_nayiru.116.t: "Attack on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 oren_nayiru.116.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] sat uncomfortably in [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] seat as notables from across the realm gathered in the great hall. There were generals, powerful merchants, noble landowners and warlords both – they had gathered to discuss the war, the Kamrayakval, and now, while famine gripped the nation, they would feast for their eventual victory. Four great tables had been set up there, at the heart of [Root.GetName]’s capital, while the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sat at the dais, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family and closest advisors by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side.\n\nOne of those advisors was leaning in close, telling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] about some important detail or other. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] ignored him. Ignored the toasts and lively conversations within the hall, the wine and festivities.\n\nInstead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was focused on one of the guards, who stood by the great doors at the very far end of the hall. There were hundreds of guards, of course. But this one wore a scarf around his neck. Some of the others did, but his was more… bulky? Ominous in its bulkiness. An ominous scarf, yes. And the hint of silver hair beneath his helmet. Plenty of Taychendi had silver hair, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knew. This silver hair, though – it made him shiver.\n\nThe guard stepped forwards, out of his position. [Root.Monarch.GetName] paled, felt a wave of sheer incomprehensible terror run down [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spine. The other guards were looking at him now too, though the attendees were still in their cups and plates. The “guard” seized a wine cup from one of the servers next to him. Raised it up high. Then smiled.\n\nA flash of light. An explosion of smoke, steam. The Kamrayakval emerged from the dust. Then chaos. [Root.Monarch.GetName] could barely comprehend what had happened – only that blood and steel and screams and death had consumed the world. The guards and any attendee with a weapon were advancing on the dragon-clad beast in front of them – and Elrandar Silverspite was cutting them down in waves. Eviscerating those who tried to flee, those who tried to stand, those who couldn’t quite make it in time – working his way towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and leaving a bloody trail of mutilated elven bodies in his wake, men and women and guards and nobles and notables and officers and more. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had jerked to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet, pushed the table away from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] – but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] only had the time to utter one command to the guards by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side."
 oren_nayiru.116.a: "“Get me out of here!”"
 oren_nayiru.116.b: "“Everyone, attack!”"
