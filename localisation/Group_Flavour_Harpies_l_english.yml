 build_our_roost_title:0 "Build Our Roost"
 build_our_roost_desc:0 "Most races of Halcann build their capitals in farmlands, where they have plenty of food nearby. However we have been blessed with wings that will carry our daughters far and wide. And so we have often made our homes in the mountains and hills, where we can build our nests safe from harm. It is time to do so again, let us build our cities out of reach from hostility up high in the rocks where only feathers can reach them!"
 restore_harpylen_title:0 "Restore the Queendom"
 restore_harpylen_desc:0 "With the fall of Harpylen and Siadanlen at the hands of Jaher 400 years ago, the harpies of Bulwar have been divided into petty matriarchies, however, that is about to change. Our flock has risen above the rest, not only uniting our traditional roosts of the Harpy Hills, but also bringing the daughters of Siaduna back into the fold. With the majority of Bulwar under our benevolent rule, neither elves, gnolls or humans pose a threat to our rule. Today, a new Queendom rises, the home of all harpies, Harpylen!"

 harpy_events.3.t:0 "A Male Population for the Roost"
 harpy_events.3.d:0 "With a roost under construction, we have the opportunity to bring a population of non-harpies to the roost - both men and women, so that in their own families new males may be born and thus sustain us. Others may migrate after the roost is completed, but a founding population would prime the roost for growth. Some disdain the idea, and claim that young harpies should travel far and wide in search of males rather than having easy access to them. Another instance of the corruption and laziness of the youth, in their eyes."

 harpy_events.5.t:0 "Mages Offer Demolition Expertise"
 harpy_events.5.d:0 "Mages are well-known for their destructive powers, and a group lead by a Harpy sorceress have come unprompted to our roost construction site at [Root.GetName] to offer what assistance they can. Powerful magic could be invaluable in shaping rocky terrain, clearing rubble, and carving out spaces beneath cliff faces. However, it is also possible that they may be too successful in their demolition, and set back our construction efforts."
 harpy_events.5.a:0 "Accept"
 harpy_events.5.b:0 "Decline"
 
 harpy_events.6.t:0 "Demolition Success"
 harpy_events.6.d:0 "Lead by the sorceress, the mages were successful in carving out significant chunks of the cliffs that now steam with cooling stone, carrying the scent of magic in the air. Spared months of excavations by hand, the architects resume their efforts with vigor."
 harpy_events.6.a:0 "An excellent development!"

 harpy_events.7.t:0 "Demolition Failure"
 harpy_events.7.d:0 "At the roost construction site of [Root.GetName], the cliffs could not bear the onslaught of forces brought on by our mages, and an avalanche has been triggered! Significant damage has been done to the construction site."
 harpy_events.7.a:0 "Blast!"

 harpy_events.8.t:0 "Shoddy Construction"
 harpy_events.8.d:0 "Due to poor planning, lack of foresight, or just plain negligence on the part of our architects, several of the foundations of our roost construction in [Root.GetName] are poorly made and cannot support much infrastructure. We can avoid them for now and build around them, but they will pose an obstacle to expansion later on and will eventually have to be dealt with."
 harpy_events.8.a:0 "Unacceptable. Resolve this immediately, whatever the cost!"
 harpy_events.8.b:0 "Be mindful of how much weight is added. We can fix this… eventually."

 harpy_events.9.t:0 "Water Supply"
 harpy_events.9.d:0 "Building on elevated ground often means separating the population from sources of fresh water. Not so in [Root.GetName], where a natural water source has been incorporated into the roost construct."
 harpy_events.9.a:0 "A fine boon."

 harpy_events.10.t:0 "Territorial Clashes"
 harpy_events.10.d:0 "Roosts are fixtures of Harpy society, and hence also Harpy politics. Even though our roost in [Root.GetName] isn’t yet complete, discord between two rival minor flocks has already erupted over territorial rights for the new roost."
 harpy_events.10.a:0 "Favor one side to quickly resolve the conflict."
 harpy_events.10.b:0 "This quarrel isn’t a concern for us."

 harpy_events.11.t:0 "Roost in [Root.GetName] Completed"
 harpy_events.11.d:0 "After years of labor, the roost at [Root.GetName] has been completed. Hewn cliffs rise into the sky, with no clear entrance from the ground. Protected by insurmountable heights, many generations of harpies will be born here in safety and fill the air."
 harpy_events.11.a:0 "We claim another piece of the sky."
 
 harpy_events.100.t:0 "The Daughters of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 harpy_events.100.d:0 "The most esteemed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], mother of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] flock, victorious in battle, and terror of her enemies, has a reputation as one of the greatest Harpies of her age and is unchallenged as a ruler.\nAs befits a ruler of her calibre and stature the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has given birth many capable children, several of whom show great promise as future rulers. As both the children themselves and our government officials are aware, however, only one can inherit and there is little in the way of consolation prizes. Our officials are adamant that it is now high time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to name a favorite among the possible successors. This is unlikely to end the competition for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favor but it will hopefully stop the worst succession struggles that might follow if our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should suffer death without having picked a clear successor."
 harpy_events.100.a:0 "The Pious daughter is our favorite."
 harpy_events.100.b:0 "The Strongest daughter is our favorite."
 harpy_events.100.c:0 "The Studious daughter is our favorite."

 harpy_events.100.j:0 "The Generous daughter is our favorite."

 harpy_events.101.t:0 "A New Matriach"
 harpy_events.101.d:0 "The death of our previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] without a designated favored daughter sent her daughters into a flurry of activity, as planned violences flared and woven plots ensnared competitors. But in the end, it was [Root.Monarch.GetName] that would triumph. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was never regarded as particularly exceptional and was never the favored child of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] mother, but perhaps it is this very lack of distinction that allowed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to escape the attentions of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] sisters. With [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] more competent competitors eliminating each other, [Root.Monarch.GetName] endured and has been proclaimed the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] flock. She will lead it with her unassuming demeanor."
 harpy_events.101.a:0 "Long live the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 harpy_events.101.a.tt:0 "Only time can tell what kind of a ruler §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! will be."

 harpy_events.103.t:0 "Rule for our Favored Daughter?"
 harpy_events.103.d:0 "Our favored daughter, [Root.Heir.GetName], is young and still has a lot to learn about life and how to be a good ruler. In the court of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], some suggest that [Root.Heir.GetName] may gather this experience by being tasked with ruling the lands of [heir_governorship_province.GetName]. In addition, [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] would have their legitimacy reinforced and so would reduce the chance of a future succession struggle.\n\nHowever, others caution that the inexperience of [Root.Heir.GetName] should be rectified closer to home and that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] should remain in the court of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] so that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] may be supervised by those who know [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]. Isolated and left to their own devices, [Root.Heir.GetName] may develop premature political ambitions if allowed to rule unsupervised."
 harpy_events.103.a:0 "Grant [Root.Heir.GetName] rule of the province."
 harpy_events.103.b:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] shall remain in the court."

 harpy_events.104.t:0 "Favored Daughter Returns"
 harpy_events.104.d:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] has returned from [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] time ruling alone. According to [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] the experience has enriched [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in more ways than one and [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is more ready than ever to succeed when our revered [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] passes. If our favored daughter did learn something, that is not very apparent to us, however, and in the court rumors are circulating that the only way [Root.Heir.GetName] enriched [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] was by lining [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] pockets during the local revenue collection."
 harpy_events.104.a:0 "Despite little personal development, all seems well."

 harpy_events.105.t:0 "Favored Daughter Revolts!"
 harpy_events.105.d:0 "Acting as a provincal ruler can undoubtedly teach many valuable lessons for those who will one day rule an empire. It can also give a first taste of real power. Recent rumors of disease spreading in the capital have reached [Root.Heir.GetName] and rather than investigate or pray for the health of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] decided that this was an excellent opportunity to seize what was rightfully going to be hers eventually."
 harpy_events.105.a:0 "Treasonous, presumptuous fledging!"

 harpy_events.106.t:0 "Favored Daughter Returns from Rulership"
 harpy_events.106.d:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] has returned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] from [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] term as a governor of [heir_governorship_province.GetName]. [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] claims these years have taught [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] many things about what it means to be the head of a government and how our state works at the local level. During [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] time away from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has had ample time to lead the local troops, oversee the administration and handle the local brokers of power."
 harpy_events.106.a:0 "Time away from the nest has done [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] good."

 harpy_events.107.t:0 "Succession Challenged!"
 harpy_events.107.d:0 "The succession of a harpy [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is often not a clean process, even in cases where the favored daughter has a strong claim. As the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] begins, [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] sister and rival during childhood refuses to accept the succession and has risen up in revolt with the support of her followers!"
 harpy_events.107.a:0 "A pitiable end for you, sister. I am glad."

 harpy_events.108.t:0 "Death of the Matriach's Father"
 harpy_events.108.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is struck with grief at the passing of her beloved father. Some found their bond unusual and unbecoming of a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and the cowardly whisper now as they did then that he was an alien influence on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. In [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart, [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall always treasure the time they spent together and value the lessons [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] learned."
 harpy_events.108.a:0 "We shall mourn his passing."
 harpy_events.108.b:0 "Set up an endowment for an institution in his name and memory."

 harpy_events.109.t:0 "Favored Daughter Requests Generalship"
 harpy_events.109.d:0 "The favored daughter of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Heir.GetName], has requested [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] mother to appoint [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] as a general and personally lead armies into battle. While the experience may certainly be instructive, it could put [Root.Heir.GetName] directly in danger."
 harpy_events.109.a:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName], lead our flock into battle!"
 harpy_events.109.b:0 "Admirable bravery, but no. There are plenty of battles in politics."

 harpy_events.110.t:0 "A Plot From the Favored Daughter?"
 harpy_events.110.d:0 "Rumors in the court have caught the ear of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], that [Root.Heir.GetName] is plotting to usurp [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] mother. It is not known from whom this information was acquired: it very well could have been one of the other daughters, who even now seek to remove [Root.Heir.GetName] from succession, whether or not the plot is real. Even so, a plot from [Root.Heir.GetName] would pose a very real threat. Some officials aware of the matter are convinced of its truth and say that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] must be assassinated in secret to foil the plot and preserve the honor of our flock."
 harpy_events.110.a:0 "Then [Root.Heir.GetName] must die."
 harpy_events.110.b:0 "Summon [Root.Heir.GetHerHim], I will hear an explanation."
 harpy_events.110.c:0 "Slander against my beloved daughter!"

 harpy_events.111.t:0 "All is Well"
 harpy_events.111.d:0 "Given time to present [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] case [Root.Heir.GetName] has fully convinced our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] innocence and will remain the most favored of our daughters. This entire ordeal has strengthened [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] standing at court and with the public in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 harpy_events.111.a:0 "I never doubted [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]."

 harpy_events.112.t:0 "Favored Daughter Revolts!"
 harpy_events.112.d:0 "The time afforded by our indecisiveness was sufficient for [Root.Heir.GetName] to assemble the rebel army [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] had intended. As the sun sets on the seventh day after [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] discovery, an army is marching towards [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 harpy_events.112.a:0 "Betrayed by my own blood..."

 harpy_events.113.t:0 "Successful Assassination"
 harpy_events.113.d:0 "The assassins we sent to kill our favored daughter have returned after successfully completing their mission. But lacking solid proof, we shall never know if [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] was guilty of treason or not."
 harpy_events.113.a:0 "A great tragedy."

 harpy_events.114.t:0 "Botched Assassination!"
 harpy_events.114.d:0 "The assassins we sent to kill our favored daughter have failed to perform their mission! [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] was cornered alone as planned, but somehow managed to escape with [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] life while defeating and injuring [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] assailants. Our former favorite has fled the capital together with a group of [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] closest supporters and now prepares to fight for [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] life."
 harpy_events.114.a:0 "How do you mess that up?!"

 harpy_events.115.t:0 "Daughter Distinguishes Herself on the Battlefield"
 harpy_events.115.d:0 "It is common for daughters of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to be appointed military officers so that they may serve the flock even if not made the favored daughter. But in our recent war, one of our daughters has distinguished herself as a competent leader and strategist, and is credited with launching devastating assaults on our enemies. The military elite has begun to take note and may well end up supporting [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in a future succession struggle."
 harpy_events.115.a:0 "A true daughter of mine, I proclaim [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] my new favored daughter."
 harpy_events.115.b:0 "See to it that her skills are used to the fullest on the field."

 harpy_events.116.t:0 "Treason Against our Elderly [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 harpy_events.116.d:0 "As the age of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] advances, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] daughters grow impatient. Unfounded rumors are regularly circulating of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] failing health and the various factions of the court are aligning with the many would-be successors among [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] daughters. For one the distance in the supposed line of succession was enough to risk the uncertainty of the rumor mill. That daughter now has taken up arms against [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 harpy_events.116.a:0 "It's treason, then."

 harpy_events.117.t:0 "Exchange of Mates"
 harpy_events.117.d:0 "A flock of harpy nobles intends to increase relations with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], and to do so has offered that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] may pick who she pleases among their mates, in exchange for some of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s own mates among [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] harem. This is not an uncommon practice among harpies, but is typically reserved for noble diplomacy, as in this case. Since biology forbids two flocks from being directly joined by blood, an exchange of mates is used so that descendants may be born of fathers that both the flocks have picked."
 harpy_events.117.a:0 "Intriguing. Let's see what you have to offer."
 harpy_events.117.b:0 "Not my thing"

 harpy_events.118.t:0 "Interflock Alliance"
 harpy_events.118.d:0 "To reinforce our own position, we have decided to form an alliance with an influential noble harpy flock. The traditional way to do so would be to swap residency and tutelage of our two daughters, so that we may develop familiarity and shared bonds. This is typically done with favored daughters, but perhaps someone lower in the line of succession may suffice - although the flock may take offense to this."
 harpy_events.118.a:0 "Send our favored daughter."
 harpy_events.118.b:0 "Send them a lesser daughter."

 harpy_events.119.t:0 "An Embarassment of a Daughter"
 harpy_events.119.d:0 "The harpy noble flock that we have made an alliance and exchanged daughters with has reached out to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], and strongly protested the behavior of our favored daughter [Root.Heir.GetName] who seems to have been a continuous source of embarassment and frustration for them, in private and in social gatherings. They are dissatisfied with our alliance under these conditions and demand that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] admonish [Root.Heir.GetName]."
 harpy_events.119.a:0 "Disgraceful conduct unbecoming of a favored daughter! We choose another ward."

Many harpies have never even met their fathers, or their fathers feel no intrinsic kinship with their daughters because of differing appearance and have no interest in them. Nevertheless, the mates of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have many eyes on them due to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] prestige. Usually the mates of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] are carefully chosen, and they may have some knowledge or skill to offer their daughter. Now, the father of our favored daughter [Root.Heir.GetName] has indicated to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that he wishes to meet with his daughter.\n\nAs a ruinborn, he was likely chosen for the prestige ruinborn mates garner in harpy society: they have staggering visual diversity, and so ruinborn of varying cultures are especially prized as husbands (though preference may differ). With such a great variety of possible backgrounds, we can only predict that he may impart our daughter with an appreciation for the cultures of Aelantir."

We have organized our administration from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] for as long as we can remember, and it is the home and history of our flock.
