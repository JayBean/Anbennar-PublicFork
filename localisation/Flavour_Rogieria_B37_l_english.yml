 rogieria_crown_farranean_title:0 "The Crown of Farraneán"
 rogieria_crown_farranean_desc:0 "Farraneán was a realm that existed where Rogieria now stands. The waves of  Greentide did not drown every Escanni in its wake, especially here along the borders with the Empire of Anbennar and the Elfrealm of Ibevar.\n\nIn the mountains of Valefort, the surviving members of the Síl na Eán family, the former rulers of Farraneán, hid to survive. If Rogier could take one as a wife, it would make the Silmuna the rightful monarchs of this land and give the returning Farrani good reasons to accept our rule."
 
 rogieria_black_tree_title:0 "The Black Tree"
 rogieria_black_tree_desc:0 "Whistlevale was the beating heart of Farraneán, and center of its realm. While many Farrani have returned to their former realm and original homes, the cities are mostly in ruins. As per the deal with Margery, Rogier agreed to restore Farraneán to its former glory, and Whistlevale is the first step.\n\nBy restoring the cities and populating the countryside, we will attract more than just Farrani refugees to our realm, but sellswords and businessmen alike– future allies and pawns for Rogier to use in his plans."
 
 rogieria_restore_caseans_title:0 "Restore the Caseáns"
 rogieria_restore_caseans_desc:0 "The Caseáns originated as a type of fortified location, similar to a castle or fortress, designed with the intention of combatting the victims of the White Pestilence. Later, they became key strongpoints in defense of Farraneán. Restoring these landmarks will keep much of Rogieria's core territory safe, and grant us a strong position to launch further expansion and reclamation."
 
 rogieria_gateway_empire_title:0 "Gateway to the Empire"
 rogieria_gateway_empire_desc:0 "Farraneán borders the Empire of Anbennar, and its restoration is an early step towards the restoration of Silmuna rule in Anbennar. What we rebuild will shape our focus in years to come."
 
 rogieria_cogauluis_ball_title:0 "The Cogaulúis Ball"
 rogieria_cogauluis_ball_desc:0 "After decades of hard work, the lands of Farraneán enjoy a prosperity that surpasses even the times of Castanor. Cities rebuilt bigger than before, the roads safe for travel, and record harvest in our farmlands.\n\nIn order to celebrate the restoration of Farraneán, Margery proposed to celebrate a Cogaulúis Ball, an Esmari custom of the first Farrani brought with them to their new homes: A river party where the waters of the Cogaulúis become filled with light, laughter and music. As goes the saying, Margery's wishes are Rogier's commands."
 
 rogieria_vincen_body_title:0 "Exhume Vincen"
 rogieria_vincen_body_desc:0 "With the darkness of the night as their veil, our Imperial allies and agents will sneak into an Istralorian cemetery in the search of Vincen's grave, hidden after the end of the fourth Lilac war. It seems strange that Vincen, former Grand Duke of Dameria and Emperor of Anbennar would rest eternally here. Yet, perhaps hiding his corpse in plain sight was the best decision. In a grave marked for 'Aldowle síl Dameria' lies the great Old Owl. Now let our agents retrieve his body and be off into the night, to return him to his family."
 
 rogieria_crown_dameria_title:0 "The Crown of Dameria"
 rogieria_crown_dameria_desc:0 "Many treasures were lost with the fall of the Silmuna and the sack of Anbenncóst. One of them was the crown of the Kingdom of Dameria, made by elven artisans for Marion Silmuna, the founder of the Silmuna dynasty.\n\nOne of our supporters gave us information that although the crown was stolen by Rose Party soldiers, it never left Anbenncóst. We need to send spies to the city to verify this information, and if possible, recover a piece of our legacy."
 
 rogieria_emulant_vincen_title:0 "Emulant of Vincen"
 rogieria_emulant_vincen_desc:0 "Among the heroes of house Silmuna, Vincen is perhaps the one who understood most deeply what Anbennar – unity – truly stands for. A master diplomat, his sincere words brought more allies to his side than Lorentish treachery could ever hope to take away.\n\nThere wasn't a court in Cannor unhappy to greet Vincen as a guest. Even the Lorentish nobles wished to gain his favor, as he wed Eilís Siloriel to end the First Lilac War. After the death of Queen Reanna III Siloriel, Vincen vowed to enforce the rightful succession according to Lorentish law, first by pushing his wife Eilís' claim, then his son Adénn's.\n\nHad it not been for the treachery of the roses, he would have succeeded, finally defeated Dameria's greatest rival, and brought all of Anbennar and Lencenor to heights of prosperity hitherto unknown. We will set our sights just as high, and not fail."
 
 rogieria_right_hand_title:0 "The Right Hand"
 rogieria_right_hand_desc:0 "The Wexonards unlawfully annexed the provinces of Varivar and Eargate after the Invasion of Damesear. Ever since, the loyal subjects of the Silmuna have been living under tyrants.\n\nIf we are going to reclaim our rightful place on the throne, it is imperative that we secure this vital defensive position against the mainland. It should be straightforward enough to contact the old Damerian loyalists, and a network among them will make claiming our rightful lands easier."
 
 rogieria_the_soul_title:0 "The Soul"
 rogieria_the_soul_desc:0 "On the southern side of the Damesear is the foremost temple of the cult of the Dame. The Silmuna are direct descendants of Auci, an avatar of the Dame, so in a sense her continued worship is both a source of national pride, and legitimizes the Silmuna bloodline. We should do our utmost to ensure the loyalty of those who control this sacred landmark, and if we can't, we can at least ensure that safe travel to and from the area is guaranteed."
 
 #Second Slot
 
 rogieria_small_council_title:0 "The Small Council"
 rogieria_small_council_desc:0 "Many loyalist nobles followed Rogier 'the Exiled' to Escann after the fall of Dameria, including many whose lands had been stolen by the perfidious Wexonards. It would be only right to make use of their influence and abilities. The foremost amongst them will be given a privileged position in the Small Council, as direct advisors to his majesty."
 
 rogieria_rogierian_nobility_title:0 "Adventurer Nobility"
 rogieria_rogierian_nobility_desc:0 "The Sons of Dameria were in no small part composed of nobles who lost everything when Dameria was butchered by the traitors. As we marched against the Greentide, former lords stood no higher than commoners.\n\nNow, Rogier sees fit to grant these loyal nobles new fiefs in the northern lands of the former kingdom of Adenica, but their time as brothers-in-arms with the common man has had a particular effect on the nobles of Rogieria.\n\nThey do not view themselves as superior – how could they, when they stood and fought and died side-by-side – and in their new fiefdoms they conduct themselves not so much as rulers, but as leaders, making common cause with their people."
 
 rogieria_heart_valley_title:0 "The Heart of the Valley"
 rogieria_heart_valley_desc:0 "Queen Margery was raised on stories of Escin, Farraneán's prestigious capital, a prosperous city and a nexus of trade between Escann and Cannor. However, when she and the king saw the city themselves, it was little more than collapsing ruins and burnt-out shells.\n\nIt is of great importance to her majesty that it be restored without delay. So it shall be! Call for the workmen, the settlers, the returning Farrani! Escin shall be Farraneán's beating heart once again!"
 
 rogieria_for_young_owl_title:0 "For the Young Owl!"
 rogieria_for_young_owl_desc:0 "Many Damerians came to Escann before and after the Greentide, from crowded Anbenncóst, the old woods of East Dameria or the bountiful farmlands of West Dameria. Pioneers, fortune-seekers and Marcher Lords. Loyalists and traitors, but Damerians nevertheless.\n\nIf we want to see a Silmuna ruling from Anbenncóst again, we need to remind them of our common origin to make them fight for our just cause. As per Rogier's command, we will give special attention to their lands, to remind them of the benevolent rule of the Silmunas."
 
 rogieria_fate_silmuna_title:0 "Fate of the Silmuna"
 rogieria_fate_silmuna_desc:0 "It was not so long ago that the Silmunas ruled Dameria from the Imperial Palace in Anbenncóst, and now where are they? Dead? Exiled? The fate of so many of our kin has been left to the records of traitors and usurpers.\n\nIt is no wonder then that our lost are so hard to find. Let us begin our hunt where it ended, the city of Anbenncóst: Where the Fourth Lilac war ended, where Silmuna dominion over the empire ended."
 
 rogieria_adenns_body_title:0 "Exhume Adenn"
 rogieria_adenns_body_desc:0 "On some obscure cliff lies a clumsily marked grave in Old Damenath that overlooks the South Dameshead. Our findings in Anbenncóst have led us here, to this somber scene.\n\nSuch a tragedy is enough to bring tears to the eye of a Silmuna, but not today. Today we have come with a purpose, not to mourn, but to exhume the corpse of Adénn 'Skylance' Silmuna. Father of Rogier the Exiled, son of Vincen 'The Old Owl' Silmuna, and the last Grand Duke of Dameria. Now, let us take him far from this sorrowful sight and give him a proper burial worthy of his stature."
 
 rogieria_emulant_adenn_title:0 "Emulant of Adenn"
 rogieria_emulant_adenn_desc:0 "Adénn 'Skylance' was an icon of chivalry, showing respect to opponents regardless of skill, age and race. He learnt every technique known in Cannor and before coming of age he even matched the techniques of the masters blow for blow. Yet the radiance of his success was brought to face the shadow of betrayal. When the Rose Party bore their thorns against the empire it was Adénn who drew the most ire, especially among the Lorentish who remembered the Skylance from the mockery he made of the Kyllian Tourney. Adénn kept fighting back with great valor no matter who or what was taken from him. Every single stone of the Imperial Palace was tainted by traitor blood until there was nothing left he could defend."
 
 rogieria_shrine_silmuna_title:0 "Shrines to the Silmuna"
 rogieria_shrine_silmuna_desc:0 "The Corinite faith is popular among our people, although the faith remains new and its tenets are still being established. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks it clear that any proper worship of Corin should also venerate those who emulated her values and her cause – like Bluetusk and the Young Owl, and even some older figures who presaged her truths.\n\nWe know Corin would want any temple to her to include shrines to these Silmunas, and in ensuring their construction, we entwine her legacy with ours."
 
 rogieria_guardian_escann_title:0 "The Guardians of Escann"
 rogieria_guardian_escann_desc:0 "When orcs overran Escann, it was saved by great heroes. Great heroes led by the goddess Corin herself. Great heroes such as Lothane 'Bluetusk' and Rogier 'the Exiled'. Great heroes such as the ordinary men and women who followed them and their fellow marcher lords east to fight and die. Now, it is protected by their heirs, the kings of Rogieria who stand foremost amongst the new kingdoms. To honor these great heroes, at the North Citadel we shall build a great monument, organized in three tiers.\n\nFirst, statues of the innumerable soldiers of the Sons of Dameria and other marcher lords, the heroes of the rank and file who came face-to-face with the horde. Above them, our forefathers Vincen and Adénn alongside the noble kings of Rogieria who continue to defend Escann to this day.\n\nAnd at the peak, those three who are to us the greatest heroes of all – Lothane 'Bluetusk', Rogier 'the Exiled', and Corin, Heroine of the Greentide."
 
 rogieria_left_hand_title:0 "The Left Hand"
 rogieria_left_hand_desc:0 "The Magisterium has a strong hold over the western gate of the Damesear. Despite having strong ties with our family, they ultimately remained neutral in the Lilac Wars.\n\nIf we could convince them to support our return, it would make the transition of power once we enact our plans much easier. Otherwise, perhaps we could use some old claims to force them into accepting our hegemony."
 
 rogieria_the_heart_title:0 "The Heart"
 rogieria_the_heart_desc:0 "Anbenncóst was - no, is the capital of Dameria, the location of the Imperial Palace, and the former seat of the Silmuna. Even after its sack in 1444, the city remains by far the most important in Anbennar, and certainly the largest in all of Cannor.\n\nThe Anbenncóster peoples have enjoyed their time in the sun as a free city, but they know their true loyalties lie with the moon. It is time for them to return to the fold."
 
 rogieria_loyalist_waiting_title:0 "Loyalists Waiting"
 rogieria_loyalist_waiting_desc:0 "Thousands of true Damerians across the empire now know of our resurgence, and we have consolidated the base of our power. Our influence is so pronounced, people are publically holding festivals in our honour, holding rallies to further support for us, and making preparations for the day our banner flies above the Imperial Palace once more.\n\nThe Silmuna name has never been more celebrated, and we haven't even made our proper return yet. The time is soon nigh. It won't be much longer until we shall march to the Damesear with a grand reception, we simply must convince a final few nations of the righteousness of our cause."
 
 #Third Slot
 
 rogieria_last_silmuna_title:0 "The Last Silmuna"
 rogieria_last_silmuna_desc:0 "Our bloodline goes back to the origins of the Empire itself. From Auci of Dameria and Munas Moonsinger we are descended. Now, standing at the helm of this venerable lineage is Rogier 'The Young Owl' Silmuna.\n\nAlthough he is not the child of Rogier the Exiled, none is more deserving than him to bear that name, as he is the son of the Greentide hero Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna. With such a worthy ruler leading our nation, great things are in our future! But it is a future shaped by deeds, not merely words – what legacy will we create?"
 
 rogieria_sons_of_dameria_title:0 "Sons of Dameria"
 rogieria_sons_of_dameria_desc:0 "When Rogier the Exiled fled from our homeland, he went in pursuit of his sister Eilís with his loyal subjects and friends, veterans of the Lilac wars all of them. Though many years have passed since he left for Escann, and though he now rests in peace, many of his followers remain alive in our new nation.\n\nThose who were squires when they left Dameria became great warriors fighting the Greentide. The experience of these nobles-turned-adventurers should not go to waste, let us have them train our army and restore their ranks as our new nobility, to reward and ensure loyalty in generations to come."
 
 rogieria_young_owl_ambition_title:0 "The Young Owl's Ambition"
 rogieria_young_owl_ambition_desc:0 "During his time with the Corintar, Rogier was always eclipsed by his father and older brother. Neither physically strong nor pious, his strength lay in his sharp mind and his charisma, but he had resigned himself to always being in the shadow.\n\nNow that has changed. In the moment that the crown was offered to him a flame grew inside him. He will not only recover what is his birthright, he will make a name of his own, a name that will cast a shadow upon the rest of his family, a legacy for the ages. The Young Owl's legacy."
 
 rogieria_kingdom_rogier_title:0 "A Kingdom for Rogier"
 rogieria_kingdom_rogier_desc:0 "The former lands of Adenica lie in a fertile plain irrigated by the waters of the Tarescker. Formerly inhabited by the Adenner knight-lords, it is now divided between Cannorian adventurers and settlers and the Escanni survivors.\n\nRogier has decided that the former Kingdom of Adenica will become the heart of the new Kingdom of Rogieria, and the first step is to claim and consolidate the Taran plains. Nevertheless, his main concern is not the land, but the people who inhabit it, since the core of his kingdom must be people loyal to him and the Silmuna family."
 
 rogieria_city_rogier_title:0 "The City of Rogier"
 rogieria_city_rogier_desc:0 "Taranton was the capital of the knightly Kingdom of Adenica but now lies in ruins. It is not the same smoldering, goblin-infested, ruin we reclaimed, but the city has seen better days.\n\nIts past history, its position in the center of Rogier's domains, and its access to the swift Tarescker river makes the city an excellent site for Rogieria's capital. Rogier himself has taken the project under his wing, designing the new city in the outskirts of Taranton on the eastern bank of the Tarescker. He spends his free time tracing roads, designing buildings and demarcating the districts of his legacy, the shining beacon of West Castanor, the city of Rogier."
 
 rogieria_reclamation_army_title:0 "Reclamation Army"
 rogieria_reclamation_army_desc:0 "We must establish a magnificent army, one fit for our glorious nascent kingdom, to strike fear into the hearts of the traitors both in Escann and Anbennar as we march across the land. But while many of our citizens cry out to return to our forefather's homeland in Dameria, just as many wish to stay in the land of second chances, fearful that an invasion of the Empire will leave their Escanni homes defenseless. The Young Owl himself is not an exception, as his newly founded kingdom is as precious to him as Dameria was for Rogier the Exiled."
 
 rogieria_dameria_east_title:0 "Dameria of the East"
 rogieria_dameria_east_desc:0 "Under the Young Owl's leadership, Rogieria has grown into a great and rich country. Abandoned towns are repopulated, ransacked fields once more growing bountiful harvests. The old lands of Adenica prosper once more, as a new Dameria is formed in Escann. Founded upon the legacies of these two mighty nations, it yet remains to be seen what Rogieria itself will be – is it solely heir to Dameria, an Anbennarian nation carried on in Escann, or is it heir also to Adenica, taking a place amongst Escanni nations? The decision concerning Rogieria's own legacy falls ultimately to the Young Owl."
 
 rogieria_king_west_title:0 "The King of the West"
 rogieria_king_west_desc:0 "After the chaos of the Age of the Greentide, from the ashes of Feudal Escann arose a new kingdom, with a soul and might never seen since the times of ancient Castanor. The legacy of one dynasty, and one man. A legacy that includes the Grand Duchy of Dameria, the Kingdoms of Feudal Escann and the warriors of the Greentide, from both sides. The legacy of the Silmunas, the kings of the west."
 
 rogieria_exume_rogier_title:0 "Exhume Rogier"
 rogieria_exume_rogier_desc:0 "Rogier 'the Exiled' may have been the last of the main branch of the Silmuna, but he was the start of the Sons of Dameria and our foundations in Escann. And though he could not find his sister Eilís the Blue, he found a nephew, and forged a nation.\n\nTruly, Rogier was a valiant man, never seeking glory or fame but instead survival for his family and the noble bloodline of the Silmunas. Let us honor him as his heirs, and celebrate both his life and death equal to that of other great Silmunas before him."
 
 rogieria_silmuna_mausoleum_title:0 "Silmuna Mausoleum"
 rogieria_silmuna_mausoleum_desc:0 "Though they may not be able to live together in glory, all Silmunas shall rest forever as a family in peace. The remains of the Lilac War heroes have been recovered, from the Old Owl to Rogier the Exiled. Now we must give them a burial worthy of their legacy.\n\nAs we carry on the torch we must not forget the fire from which we lit it. To that purpose, [Root.Capital.GetName] will serve us well. A mausoleum must be built to house the great rulers of the past, and it shall be built with the magnificence and care that these rulers put into our people. No expenses should be spared, after all, who we are is defined by the legacy that has been and our legacy to come."
 
 rogieria_damerian_paragons_title:0 "Damerian Paragons"
 rogieria_damerian_paragons_desc:0 "As the land has recovered, there has been time for people to do more than eke out a living,to learn and grow. Unsurprisingly, much of this learning has been about Silmunas past and present – a commendable initiative, but one with some unintended consequences.\n\nJust as most Corinites seek to emulate their goddess in thought and deed, it seems some in Rogieria do the same with Silmunas past. Undoubtedly strange, is this a matter for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 
 rogieria_emulant_lothane_title:0 "Emulant of Lothane"
 rogieria_emulant_lothane_desc:0 "Born to Ellís Silmuna, who was lost to the Silmuna family. Lothane's strength is a proof of his heritage. In the face of catastrophe he rose to the occasion without hesitation. With the bravery, strength and tenacity that no man could emulate he fought back. A true warrior who faced his foes together with the gods of his time. His place in history is set in stone as the Corintari continues to act out his will. The fruits from his efforts feed the new generations of Escanni, safeguarding its lands. We are grateful for his sacrifice and will make sure to follow in his footsteps, no matter how hard we must work to do so."
 
 rogieria_embrace_cult_title:0 "Embrace the Cult"
 rogieria_embrace_cult_desc:0 "Otar the Mad's sermons had a profound impact on Rogieran society. The majority of our people had abandoned the worship of most of the gods, with the exception of Corin and the Dame. Now the Damerian paragons, with Rogier the Exiled at the forefront are occupying our people's hearts, not as gods, but as role models. Now it's time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to announce which of our paragons the kingdom should emulate."
 
 rogieria_leverage_loyalties_title:0 "Leverage Old Loyalties"
 rogieria_leverage_loyalties_desc:0 "The desire for the glorious return of house Silmuna burns beyond the borders of Escann, igniting the passionate loyalties of a not so distant past. The Lilac wars left a scar all across the Empire, shattering the pride of many prominent families. Under the banner of Rogier we shall have them remember their oaths to our family and together we will break the will of the usurpers and  bring the imperial crown back where it belongs."
 
 rogieria_organize_faithful_title:0 "Organize the Faithful"
 rogieria_organize_faithful_desc:0 "Those loyal to the Silmuna are starting to gather and we have grand plans for them. Beyond supporting us for the throne, the conspirators serve one other crucial purpose: Tear down the emperor.\n\nWhat better sight to prove our claim than members of the empire turning on their nominal sovereign? With sufficient backing, we can tear the emperor's legitimacy and authority to shreds."
 
 rogieria_shadow_moonlight_title:0 "Shadows in the Moonlight"
 rogieria_shadow_moonlight_desc:0 "On a clear night with a full moon, the world seems lit silver. And now, with the Shadowmoon Conspiracy well-established, our path forward is just as clear."
 
 rogieria_road_home_title:0 "The Road Home"
 rogieria_road_home_desc:0 "We have toiled, yearned, and fought hard for our place in Escann. We waged war with orcs, goblins, and even other adventurers who sought to end our legacy.Have we not earned our rest? Yet how can we rest when so many of our people still dream of returning home, to the rolling hills of the Damesear. To sail in the waters of the Dameshead or to walk the bustling streets of Anbenncóst.\n\nOur people will not be ignored, for we have the tools at our disposal. The might of Escann and loyal allies that support our return. The road home will be flanked with the Silmuna emblem!"
 
 rogieria_challenge_made_title:0 "The Challenge Made"
 rogieria_challenge_made_desc:0 "In 1443 the Grand Duke Adénn 'Skylance' Silmuna was murdered in the Imperial Palace of Anbenncóst by the treacherous Erlan of Wesdam. How ironic that the slaughter of our forefathers served only to bring about a brighter future upon our house.\n\nBeyond Anbennar, we have twice-proven our rightful claim to an empire, making it as clear as moonlight. We have revived Escann and left behind a legacy that will eclipse Castanor, and who could deny that our subjects have better lives under our rule? We saved Escann from anarchy, we will now save the Empire from unrightful rulership."
 
 rogieria_return_king_title:0 "The Return of the King"
 rogieria_return_king_desc:0 "A dynasty made ashes, now back ablaze. A world steeped in shadows, now cleansed by light. Broken blades and broken peoples, reforged and renewed.\n\nOnly one step remains. There is a crown owed to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] – it is time for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to be crowned Emperor."

 rogieria_of_rogieria_silmuna_title:0 "House of Rogieria"
 rogieria_of_rogieria_silmuna_desc:0 "Legacy is an important thing. After all, it is Dameria's legacy Rogier aims to reclaim. But what use is legacy with nobody to whom it can be passed on?\n\nThe Silmunas were all but wiped out in the Lilac Wars, save the king's uncle Rogier 'the Exiled', and his great father Lothane 'Bluetusk'. (The less said about traitorous Wesdam the better.) Rogier must produce an heir, and ensure that the rightful line of Rogieria-Silmuna continues."

 rogieria_rogierian_burghers_title:0 "Rogierian Burghers"
 rogieria_rogierian_burghers_desc:0 "Along with our own loyal nobles, there are many who have followed us seeking new opportunities, as well as Greentide refugees now hoping to reclaim their homeland.\n\nThe southern woodlands of the old kingdom of Merewood are a prime candidate for such efforts – with the right investments, these areas could become highly profitable for our fledgling nation."

 rogieria_fortress_greyntide_title:0 "Adennthíl"
 rogieria_fortress_greyntide_desc:0 "The restoration of Bal Mire has given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the architecture of Balgar the Builder. With these lessons in mind, Rogier plans to build a mighty tower, a fortress in its own right, to watch the north.\n\nIt will be named Adennthíl, for the king's grandfather, famed as the epitome of knightly skill and chivalric virtue. Just as Adénn was a great guardian to his people, so shall his tower forever guard Rogieria."

 rogieria_rogierian_tea_title:0 "Lothane's Blue"
 rogieria_rogierian_tea_desc:0 "Though originally introduced to Cannor by the elves, tea has become synonymous with Damerian culture. It is only natural that we carry on such treasured traditions in our new home.\n\nThe difficulty of imports from Anbennar has encouraged some farmers to develop new varieties; indeed, one known as Lothane's Blue has gained particular popularity amongst our people – gaining its unusual hue by the same magical means as the traditional Elven Silver."

 rogieria_death_lothane_title:0 "The Death of Lothane"
 rogieria_death_lothane_desc:0 "Our nation has been thrown into mourning – Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna, nephew of Rogier 'the Exiled' and father of the Young Owl, in a way grandfather to our nation, has died at age 105.\n\nIn his great life he was a hero of the Greentide, companion to Corin herself, and first grandmaster of the Corintar. Furthermore, as one of our line, his life forged a bond between us and the knightly order unique in Escann.\n\nCorintari diplomats are received more happily and easily in Rogieria, and their knights respond to our requests for aid more readily – the Corintar shall always be part of the Silmuna legacy."

 rogieria_exume_lothane_title:0 "Exhume Lothane"
 rogieria_exume_lothane_desc:0 "In the forests on the outskirts of Ionntrás, there is a small cottage. There, a man spent his last decades in a well deserved peace and now he lies in a humble grave.\n\nHere is the resting place of Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna, a great and noble man, hero of the Greentide, responsible for many great deeds to which our nation owes its existence. No Rogieran would dare deny that he is a true and legitimate member of our house, and he deserves no less than to lie alongside his forefathers."

 rogieria_sons_of_rogieria_desc:0 ""Rogier was strong, Rogier was quick,\nRogier was wise, he had a sharp wit.\nWe're not Rogier, no sirree.\nBut we sure do try to be!"\n\n-A popular song among Rogieran half-orcs, which was adopted by the army as a marching tune in the early 1500s."

 rogieria_adeline_of_rogieria_title:0 "Adeline síl Rogieria"
 rogieria_adeline_of_rogieria_desc:0 "For the enemies of Rogieria, there is nothing more terrifying than the roar of our artillery batteries. We spearheaded their usage in Escann in the mid 1500, and some say that the first design of our cannons were made by the Young Owl himself!\n\nNow, a different Half-orc plans to make our batteries even stronger. Adeline is a young prodigy, heiress to one of the most important foundries in our kingdom. She has presented to [Root.Monarch.GetName] a new design: lighter, cheaper and with an extended range, capable of terrifying our enemies from afar."

 rogieria_cult_rogier_title:0 "The Cult of Rogier"
 rogieria_cult_rogier_desc:0 "The cult of the Damerian paragons has become a fundamental part of the Corinite church of Rogieria as the Rogierans try to follow in Corin's footsteps by emulating the chivalry of Adénn, the diplomacy of Vincen, or the piety of Lothane. But now, a man called Otar the Mad has started preaching in our capital about how Rogier 'the Exiled' is the greatest paragon of all. This is clearly an issue that demands the attention of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 rogieria_emulant_rogier_title:0 "Emulant of Rogier"
 rogieria_emulant_rogier_desc:0 "Rogier 'the Exiled' was a hero of the Greentide, adventurer, and the founder of our nation. He was the rightful emperor, but forced into exile.

They continue his work, aspire to his skills, and always ask themselves "what would Lothane do?"

It is no longer a mere company of exile lords and soldiers. Escann is a home for us now. The Sons are a country. In honour of your noble uncle, who led us through so many of our early years, we are called Rogieria.”\n\n“I am pleased, my friends. Is that the sole reason for your visit?”\n\n“A country needs a king, my lord. With your uncle's death, you are the sole rightful heir to Dameria. We come to offer the crown to you.”\n\nLothane looked away for a moment. “I am sorry, my friends, I cannot. My place is here, with the Corintar. I have a sworn duty to fulfil Corin's legacy, to finish her dream.”\n\n“What of you, my lord Ellís? After your fath-“\n\nEllís held up his hand. “My place is also here. I have no desire to be a ruler, let alone a king.”\n\n“My lords, we must have a Silmuna of the rightful line. I beg you to reconsider.”\n\nLothane looked behind them. “Rogier. What do you say?”\n\nThe delegates turned – in the corner of the room, sat another half-orc they had not previously seen –- Lothane's second son. His gaze was fixed on the opposite window as he pensively stroked his beard, but there was a burning light of ambition in his eyes.\n\n“I shall do it.

We are not just a company of exile lords and soldiers anymore. We’ve made a home here in Escann, a country.” He looked away sheepishly. “They insisted on calling it ‘Rogieria’.”\n\nLothane smirked. “I am hardly in a position to criticise. But why did you come all this way to tell us in person?”\n\n“I need an heir, Lothane. You are my sister’s son, and by my own pronouncement a rightful member of our house.”\n\nLothane looked away for a moment. “I am sorry, uncle, I cannot. My place is here, with the Corintar.

But then the letter arrived.\n\n"My liege, while my family and I are very grateful for your proposal, it is my duty as a father to ensure the happiness of my daughter, especially now that we are leaving behind the dark times. She has asked me to meet you in person before accepting the wedding proposal. And so I invite you to my domain of Valefort, for her, and so that the people of Farraneán can know their future king, if Ryala wishes it."\n\nRogier was rarely nervous before even the fiercest battle, but he certainly was as he entered the Caseán's reception feast. Despite appearing more human-like than his father and brother, it didn't change the fact that orc blood ran through his veins. While the Corintari saw him as the son of the Grandmaster Lothane 'Bluetusk', and the Rogierans saw in him the heir of Rogier the Exiled, he knew how his kind was seen in most Escann.\n\nMargery was sitting on the other side of a table. Tall and regal, with her long brown hair tied up in a braid, she made a gesture with the hand, indicating for Rogier to sit. And then she talked. Rogier was stunned. She had deduced Rogier's designs and didn't want to be a mere pawn in his plans, so she proposed a deal. She would accept the marriage proposal if Rogier promised to restore Farraneán, its people and culture to its former glory.\n\nRogier left for the trip with a plan.

But he couldn't invade the Empire, not yet at least. Although Rogieria was born with a strength never seen in Escann since the Greentide, thanks to the efforts of his uncle and the Sons of Dameria, it's not enough. Rogier needs a plan if he wants to recover his birthright and ensure his legacy. A plan to fulfill his ambition.\n\nRogier shifted his eyes to the Escann maps. He grabbed a quill and marked three points on the map.\n\nIn the western vale, the former kingdom of Farraneán. The Síl na Eán family still rules a remnant in the mountains of Valefort. A royal marriage with the family will make Rogier the legitimate ruler of the Forlorn Vale, giving him an edge with the other adventurer kingdoms.\n\nIn the core of his realm, the former lands of Adenica. A new capital needs to be designed and erected to act as the heart of the new kingdom. Cities need to be built and fields to be plowed.\n\nIn the northern woods and swamps, the lands of Balmire. The shores of the Alen are dangerous and represent a weakness in Rogieria's defenses, so restoring the former Castanorian Citadel would secure Rogier's kingdom while also allowing the riches of the north to flow south.\n\nRogier left the quill, and contemplated the map.
