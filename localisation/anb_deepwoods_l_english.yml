 I45_cluster_1_title:0 "Silent Lake Grove"
 I45_cluster_1_desc:0 "The Silent Lake of Clan Elyn has long been known as one of the most tranquil groves, at least along the shores. Elynáyle, the traditional capital has long been a place for elves to live out nostalgic memories of days in the remnant fleet. Its inhabitants have long spent their days sailing across the placid waters and fishing the bountiful waters to their hearts' content. Despite what one would expect of the Fey Forest, the open waters of the lake itself hold no significant threats to life or limb.\n\nThe southern shore is noted for a swampier character, with looming mangrove-like leviathans towering from the waters, creating a tangle of roots far more perilous than the open waters. The southernmost part of the grove, near Sáwelahain has long been a goblin stronghold, though the lake's shore has remained elven since the initial conquests."
 I45_cluster_2_title:0 "Mountain Grove"
 I45_cluster_2_desc:0 "The Mountain Grove of Clan Myna has long been appreciated as the one place where the land pierces the heavens, breaks free from the oppressive darkness of the forest's canopies. Their proud mountain home is carved from the caves in which the frightened elves, trapped within the forest first sheltered. Its caverns and slopes hold numerous hand-hewn dwellings that have been continuously inhabited for nearly the whole of the elves' tenure in the wood.\n\nThe Myna have long stood as a beacon of the Wood Elves' culture, above the rest in both valor and elevation. The woods of the grove are largely unremarkable, more peaceful than most thanks to their proximity to the forest's edge. Though it should be minded, "peaceful" may be quite a different measure in the Deepwoods."
 I45_cluster_3_title:0 "Thorn Grove"
 I45_cluster_3_desc:0 "The Thorngrove of Drennen lies at the center of the Deepwoods. It stands as perhaps the most overtly menacing part of the forest. While brambles and spines are nothing unusual in any part of the wood, even the trees take on a warped and thorny appearance this deep in the groves. While quite thoroughly cleansed of goblins and other rivals to the elves, the region was perhaps one of the most tightly held by the Fey. The spirits' sway has long been quite firm with pathways, and even whole villages seeming to phase in and out of the material plane on a whim."
 I45_cluster_4_title:0 "Bone Grove"
 I45_cluster_4_desc:0 "The Bone Grove has long been the home of Clan Cenág, one of the least numerous but tightest knit of the elves' clans. Though every wood elf quickly learns to navigate the tangle of roots and ferns that make up the Deepwood's paths, in the Bone Grove, they are forced to also learn to keep their balance when discarded femurs and tibias are added to that mix, and to mind the dens of bones and skulls at the center of many a clearing. Despite the danger of the bone-hoarders that inhabit these strange dwellings, this grove also has long held one of the greatest concentrations of goblins remaining in the forest."
 I45_cluster_5_title:0 "Flower Grove"
 I45_cluster_5_desc:0 "A name like the "Flower Grove" would surely put the mind at ease… Wouldn't it be one of the loveliest of the wood? With those softly glowing bulbs lending it light, with the vibrant colors of the ever-blooming flowers. The Scotha would call it lovely indeed. But who doesn't adore their home? Few others would, as the flowers were important enough to earn the grove's name only thanks to the great danger they pose.\n\nEvery inhabitant of the grove need make themselves a botanist, perhaps even an alchemist for the ease with which one could find danger in its beautiful flora. From friendly-looking fruits that can rot the gut, to pollens that set all manner of strange hazes over the mind, even a poorly judged step can find thorns filled with Cannor's most potent toxins ripping through the sole of a traveler's boot."
 I45_cluster_6_title:0 "Hunter's Grove"
 I45_cluster_6_desc:0 "The Hunter's Grove is home to the mightiest, most twisted beasts of the Deepwoods. Those who dare to try and tame it soon grow into warriors that rival even the forest's orcish invaders in their might. Providing they survive, of course. Home to Clan Fealgarn, the grove provides perhaps the most sporting hunts in all of Cannor. The giant malformed pets of the Fey crash through the woods, splintering the ancient trees as they stalk their prey with venomous claws, with rows of teeth so numerous that one could hardly take count before they're taken into them. "
 I45_cluster_7_title:0 "Arrow Grove"
 I45_cluster_7_desc:0 "The Arrow Grove of the Ayeth's exact etymology is disputed. Is it for the fine wood employed in the crafting of arrows? Or is it the fact that arrows have long been the only reliable weapon, when a single misstep upon the treacherous ground could send one plunging to their demise? The limestone caverns beneath this part of the wood have eroded the forest floor into a maze of caverns, tunnels and gullies too treacherous for navigation.\n\nIt's far safer to traverse the canopy, bounding through the branches, swinging along vines, than to risk the treacherous maze below, where one misstep could send you down as long a fall as one from the canopy to firm ground. Even most of the Fey are reticent to trespass the treacherous earth of the grove, for the horrors that lurk beneath it promise some of the most torturous fates that the natural world offers outside the Effelai Jungle."
 I45_cluster_8_title:0 "River Grove"
 I45_cluster_8_desc:0 "Perhaps the most sincerely tranquil and pleasant of the groves, at least in days past, the River grove Ahain was, until the coming of the Greentide, a rare bastion of natural harmony in the Deepwoods. Elves, goblins, and some of the Woods' most prominent populations of satyr lived peacefully side by side. It is even rumored that a few remaining ancestors of the centaurs had been sighted living peacefully there, from time to time.\n\nThe region long held some of the least ireful of the Fey, resulting in the land's disposition to groves of bountiful fruits, and rivers teeming with an abundance of fish, around which most settlements were clustered. As the forest recovers from the orcish assault, one can only pray that this peace and abundance might return."
 I45_cluster_9_title:0 "Shadow Grove"
 I45_cluster_9_desc:0 "Ghul, the Shadow Grove. Home to the clan of that name, this remote corner of the forest had long been the black sheep of the Deepwoods. Shaded by the embrace of the Serpentspine's towering peaks on two sides, and an impenetrably thick canopy of black leaves above, the region was pitch black, with even the Jorkad river's headwaters wholly shaded in their flow, not a ray of light to be seen along its desperately rushing waters.\n\nThe grim elves of Ghul are rumored not only to appease the Unseelie, in their perversions and dark whimsy, but even to take travelers in appeasement of the viciously misanthropic Ashentree Fey, their dark practices a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."

 I45_securize_the_border_title:0 "Secure the Border"
 I45_securize_the_border_desc:0 "Following the emergence of the Greentide, many of the gladeways leading into the Deepwoods were abandoned. We must remedy this by establishing control over the outward paths. In doing so, we will ensure the safety and security of the Deepwoods from other potential outside invaders."
 I45_the_oak_guard_title:0 "The Oak Guard"
 I45_the_oak_guard_desc:0 "Having assumed control of the outer gladeways, we should re-institute the Oak Guard. This unit will maintain a constant vigilance upon the paths leading into the Deepwoods, thus ensuring that our lands will be adequately defended from any who would dare try to trespass into our wooded homeland."
 I45_cyranvar_renaissance_title:0 "Cyranvar Renaissance"
 I45_cyranvar_renaissance_desc:0 "The decision to improve the capital has proven providential. Even now, throngs of traders and other peoples from across Cannor have begun to engage with our realm en masse. We should ensure that this engagement will be beneficial for the state by adopting any of the customs or institutions that the outside world has innovated upon."
 I45_develop_infrastructure_title:0 "Develop Infrastructure"
 I45_develop_infrastructure_desc:0 "The destruction wrought by the Greentide has left the Deepwoods devastated. If we are to having any hope of creating a state capable of withstanding the threats that surround us, we must reverse this. Develop the realm so that our ancestors might be proud, and our enemies wary of thinking about thoughts of invasion!"
 I45_promote_education_title:0 "Promote Education"
 I45_promote_education_desc:0 "The ever-growing needs of the state require an almost inexhaustible amount of well educated bureaucrats. In order to ensure that our population is able to fill this demand, we will establish institutes of higher learning throughout Cyranvar."
 I45_only_the_best_title:0 "Only the Best"
 I45_only_the_best_desc:0 "Our decision to pursue a policy of enforced isolation is predicated on maintaining a highly elite standing army. While everyone is expected to undergo military training so that they might be called up in times of dire need, only the best among us are fit to serve in the standing army. This ensures that we have a serious military edge over our rivals, but this also means that filling our ranks to replace our fallen soldiers is difficult."
 I45_a_safe_country_title:0 "A Safe Country"
 I45_a_safe_country_desc:0 "As part of our ongoing policy of isolation, leading figures in our military establishment have called for the adoption of a strategy of preemptive engagement. They argue that striking beyond our borders to quell rising threats is superior to a policy of reactive defensiveness. The veracity of their argument has struck a chord with the High King. We must crush whatever threats emerge before they can harm our homeland!"
 I45_the_model_elf_title:0 "The Model Elf"
 I45_the_model_elf_desc:0 "In deciding to pursue isolation, our state has needed to thoroughly educated the populace about the benefits of this. Part of this education is rooted in a policy of mandatory service, known colloquially as the "Model Elf" program. Our citizens know that only by being wholly devoted to Cyranvar will the state prosper,and the security of the country be preserved. This ensures that we enjoy certain economic and military benefits that most states lack."

 I45_demand_the_oak_oath_title:0 "Demand the Oak Oath"
 I45_demand_the_oak_oath_desc:0 "The destruction of the orcish invaders has put us in the position of foremost prominence among the remaining Wood Elven states. We shall demand an oath of fealty from the remaining Kings in order to unite our people for the first time in history. Any who might foolishly decline this generous offer will be brought to heel by force."
 I45_a_capital_city_title:0 "A Capital City"
 I45_a_capital_city_desc:0 "As Cyranvar coalesces into a true state, our capital is sorely lacking compared to the other great cities of Cannor. If we are to truly assume a new found position of importance, we must renovate the capital to reflect the future orientation of our glorious state."
 I45_toward_the_future_title:0 "Toward the Future"
 I45_toward_the_future_desc:0 "The unification of the Deepwoods and the establishment of the Oak Monarchy affords our King the unique opportunity of deciding upon the direction of the Wood Elven people. Hardliners among us advocate for a policy of strict isolation to ensure that something like the Greentide will never happen again. Those with more liberal attitudes see the wonders that Cannor has to offer and argue for the adoption of a more open policy. Both directions will have serious consequences for the future of Cyranvar, choose wisely eminence!"
 I45_remember_the_fallen_title:0 "Remember the Fallen"
 I45_remember_the_fallen_desc:0 "As Cyranvar continues to develop, we mustn't ever forget our ancestors. Through their selfless sacrifice were our people saved. If not for them, then the Greentide would have destroyed us. As the kingdom develops we must commemorate their bravery through great works erected in their honour."
 I45_economic_boom_title:0 "Economic Boom"
 I45_economic_boom_desc:0 "Food on every table! Our economic policies have proven to be a resounding success. The economy has reached levels of prosperity we thought impossible, and the state will greatly benefit from this!"
 I45_silvar_ishu_title:0 "Silvar Ishu"
 I45_silvar_ishu_desc:0 "In choosing to isolate ourselves from Cannor, we have come to develop a relationship rooted in equilibrium with the Deepwoods. All of the actions of our Kingdom are rooted in respecting the limits and boundaries of our forested homeland. This has greatly deepened our ties with the feys and spirits of the land, who have taken to calling us the "Silvar Ishu" or Children of the Forest."
 I45_craft_the_meweri_scepter_title:0 "Craft the Meweri Scepter"
 I45_craft_the_meweri_scepter_desc:0 "The High King of the Deepwoods deserve an item of office truly befitting the position. To this end, we have summoned the greatest craftsmen from across the realm to requisition an enchanted sceptre to symbolize the office of the High King of the Oak Monarchy."
 I45_under_the_canopy_title:0 "Under the Canopy"
 I45_under_the_canopy_desc:0 "Beneath the shadowed canopy of the Deepwoods, our people thrive! Centuries have passed since the devastation of the Greentide, yet thanks to our beneficent rule, Cyranvar is now the envy of Cannor. Our economy is burgeoning, trade continues to blossom and none would dare to challenge our military might! Never again shall the Wood Elves suffer under the yoke of foreign invaders, for we have assumed our rightful position among the peoples of the world!"

 I45_toward_unification_title:0 "Toward Unification"
 I45_toward_unification_desc:0 "While Cyranvar is by far the most dominant realm in the Deepwoods, we have yet to exert full control over our homeland. We must remedy this by bringing any who might resist our designs into submission. Only through unification might we hope to achieve our rightful place in Cannor."
 I45_a_united_deepwoods_title:0 "United Deepwoods"
 I45_a_united_deepwoods_desc:0 "Through countless wars and great struggle, we have managed to unite the entirety of the Deepwoods under our rule. Plans have begun to emerge to elevate the status of our newly unified realm, time will tell what direction our state shall pursue."
 I45_a_high_king_title:0 "A High King"
 I45_a_high_king_desc:0 "Successfully uniting the entire of our wooded homeland has allowed our monarch to truly assume a position of importance. The Oak Monarchy has been established, heralding in a new chapter for our people under the illustrious rule of the High King of the Wood Elves."
 I45_the_keys_to_rule_title:0 "The Keys to Rule"
 I45_the_keys_to_rule_desc:0 "With the progression of time, and the evolution of political and cultural attitudes, our state now finds itself at a crossroads. Serious division has arisen among the people over the nature of the Oak Monarchy. Some advocate for the High King to assume a position of absolute authority, ensuring that the state remains strong. Other suggests that a parliament or some other delegative body be established, lessening the power of the King and handing over authority to elected officials. They argue that this would ensure the monarch remains legitimate, and will allow for the development of a more dynamic state. Regardless of the direction the King chooses, a decision must be made now."
 I45_develop_artisanat_title:0 "Develop Artisanat"
 I45_develop_artisanat_desc:0 "In choosing to pursue a policy of openness, we must ensure that our economy doesn't become dominated by our neighbours. To avert this potential economic slavery, the kingdom will intervene wherever necessary to ensure the development of a strong, thriving Cyranvar no matter the cost."
 I45_centralize_money_printing_title:0 "Centralize Money Printing"
 I45_centralize_money_printing_desc:0 "Our policy of supporting the Artisanat has been a resounding success. Yet despite this, private money suppliers exert an undue influence upon our economy which is a growing concern. We must exert our control by becoming the sole supplier of currency. This will ensure that money continues to flow, though we may run into some challenges..."
 I45_one_of_many_title:0 "One of Many"
 I45_one_of_many_desc:0 "In pursuing a policy of openness, our people have come to value trade and production above all else. As a result, the influence exerted by the mercantile classes has led to a qualitative change upon our culture, this is most evident in military affairs. In times of war, all are expected to serve and to do their duty, yet no room is afforded for bravado or individual greatness. Every soldier is but one of many."
 I45_expert_artisan_title:0 "Expert Artisans"
 I45_expert_artisan_desc:0 "The skill of our artisans is incomparable. Nowhere across Cannor can one find individuals of comparable quality. The Artisans have proven to be a resounding success, as the future generations are able to continue to improve upon the skills inherited from their masters."
 I45_the_cosmopolitan_elf_title:0 "The Cosmopolitan Elf"
 I45_the_cosmopolitan_elf_desc:0 "Our ancestors traditions proved incapable of adapting to the rapidly changing world around us. In seeking to open our borders and engage with the continent at large, our economy has thrived and a more egalitarian society has developed. No longer shall any individual feel beholden to time honoured traditions. Instead we are a truly cosmopolitan people, willing and able to adopt the best practices of all cultures."

 I45_internal_trade_title:0 "Internal Trade"
 I45_internal_trade_desc:0 "The opening of the Deepwoods has seriously hindered our ability to profit from the fruits of our labour. If we are to have any hope of seeing trade thrive in our land, we must limit the ability of foreign merchants to exploit our resources. We must adopt whatever means necessary to advantage our merchants and limit the ability of predatory foreign merchants to exploit us."
 I45_a_protectionism_approach_title:0 "A Protectionist Approach"
 I45_a_protectionism_approach_desc:0 "Our measures to protect internal trade have proven to be inadequate. Even with serious barriers to trade, foreigners continue to exploit our poor economic position. Harsher barriers must be erected lest we become slaves to foreign economic interests. We're going to make the Deepwoods great again!"

 woodelf_nation_title:0 "Unite the Deepwoods!"
 woodelf_nation_desc:0 "We have finally crushed the Greentide and assumed a position of dominance among the various Wood Elven realms. Our King sees the opportunity presented by this, and has called for the Verdant Pact to be unified into a true state for the Wood Elven people. Naturally our vassals will be absorbed in the process and we will be able to press our claim upon whatever portions of out homeland remain out of our reach.

 WOOD_own_the_emerald_path_desc:0 "Even with the entirety of the Verdant Link lying within the Pact's hands, the raids continue when conflict flares up. Our allies' laxity in protecting the Links requires a change of policy. We must personally assume control of the Verdant Link, only then will the safety and security of our realm be ensured. This will have the added benefit of affording us a serious advantage over our compatriots once the Greenskins have been driven from our lands."
 WOOD_the_verdant_pact_title:0 "The Verdant Pact"
 WOOD_the_verdant_pact_desc:0 "The sudden onslaught of the Greenskins has caught our people completely unawares. In order to mount a proper defense of our lands, the various chiefs and petty kings formed the Verdant Pact to coordinate the war effort. We must deepen our ties with the various Wood Elven realms in an effort to forge a stronger united front, so that we might begin to mount an offensive against the vile orcs."

 WOOD_settle_the_refugees_desc:0 "When the Greentide first began, many of our people's realms were caught completely off-guard. Before they could even mount an effective resistance they were snuffed out. No matter what the old guard in the realm might grumble about now, we are Wood Elves first and foremost. Clan loyalties and old strife have no place in the face of this menace. To this effect, those few souls who survived the devastation wrought must be resettled so that we might benefit from their expertise in the trying times ahead."

 WOOD_the_verdant_army_desc:0 "The purpose of the Verdant Pact was to present a united front against the barbarous orcs. To this end, a common army of the Wood Elven realms was formed.

You, Chivalrous Conqueror\nA gift I have for thee!\nA most coveted power.\nTo become a champion of the tree!\nYour future is bright, if you make right\nThe suffering done unto me.\nYour power will grow, as will the seed you sow\nYour reach like the roots of a tree\nAnd will topple the kingdom of man\nAll you must do is take the hand of thee.\n\nThe dryad's singsong voice is a strange contrast to the fierce, fiery look on her face, which reminds the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the anger on some near-berserk warriors. She offers her pristine hand, lips curling into a smile, teeth bared. Her robe of leaves and ivy begins to slip. There is a choice to be made, here and now, one that will determine the future of [Root.GetName]. But is it a choice at all?"

 deepwoods.33.d:0 "Butterflies are amongst the most deceptive creatures one can encounter in the poison-filled meadows of our land. For all their fragility and beauty, their presence oft means suffering and death. I still recall the first tragedy borne of the butterfly. It came at the wings of the Alyana Blue, who emerge from their cocoons every 90 years to mate for one week before returning to their long slumber.\n\nThey descended upon the adolescent trainees busy practicing their side steps who - in their ignorant youth - did not flee at blue cloud head toward them, but instead got closer to observe this phenomenon. Upon the butterflies landing on trainees, the glade was soon filled with the plagued screams of tortured souls. Where the butterflies rested, multiple pustules erupted with fountains of blood. Moments later, their teeth began to rot as their eyes… no, I shall not desecrate their bodies further by describing the horrors. Truly, butterflies are some of the cruelest creations of the Herald of Change.\n\nIt has taken weeks, but I have tallied the losses of that week across our grove. With deep sorrow and a heavy heart, I place the following into our records… \n\n-Excerpt from The Chronicles of the Scotha"

 deepwoods.34.d:0 "The Elves of Salla Drennen have long known that their home, the Thorn Grove, was closer to the Feyrealm than anywhere else in the Deepwoods. Indeed, during the time of the Verdant Veil, the fey seemed to have moved the freest there, able to pass from their maddening realm into ours at will. People could also move the other direction, and there are many tales and records of travelers accidentally slipping through into the Fey realm. In the most extreme cases,  entire villages would simply disappear without a trace, buildings and people all.\n\nWith the Verdant Veil gone, there were some who had hoped such events would cease. These hopes were dashed, when reports came in that multiple settlements have seemingly vanished in [deepwoods_disappeared_villages_province.GetName]. The shock of these disappearances has come down hard on relatives of the missing, and search parties were sent out to look for any signs  But the vanished hamlets have left no trace - the ground where they once stood is now wild woodland bearing no signs that anyone ever lived there at all."

Almost exactly where they had disappeared, the villages have returned. Once again small cottages can be found nested atop the dense wood and the sounds of rural life once again hum alongside the quiet tune of wildlife. \n\nThe joyous news swept the surrounding countryside, and people flocked to the lost villages - some to gawk, others to search for lost loved ones. Celebrations quickly turned muted, however, when differences began to be noticed . To start, not everyone seems to have returned, and those who have returned have been described by their former friends and relatives as… different than before. They all bear marks of being feytouched - some more manic, others dreary, others possessed by strange humor and still others moving about as if in a haze.

 deepwoods.36.d:0 "Much like the rest of the Deepwoods, the mines of Yfelorr share an unbreakable bond to the Feyrealm. The fathomless depths of the mine shine with argent light, a seemingly undepletable supply of silver. The caves themselves are never quite the same twice, and rich veins can appear or vanish seemingly at random, ensuring that there is ample silver waiting to be mined every sunrise.\n\nDespite the boundless wealth of Yfelorr, the mine does not yield its wealth without a protest - Though the silver replenishes, so too did the rock that surrounds it, and the caves are often unstable. In the dark depths below the surface, the miners claim that there are terrifying fey beasts and whispers that torment the mine, and it was impossible to stay below for extended periods.\n\nRecently, several new caverns have appeared that hold great promise. After a cautious exploration, our people have returned excitedly to announce they are full of rich silver veins waiting for exploitation - if only we bring the tools and light the dark tunnels. This is surely a great opportunity for the nation."

All the while [Monarch Name] rubbed [his/her] temple all while thinking on how this mess started…\n\nIt began two weeks ago, a Bulswari merchant was using silver coins minted by us to pay for an order. That should’ve been the end of that story. But, instead, some of those coins transmuted into an unknown lesser metal! The merchant was then arrested for fraud. Unfortunately, he would not be the last.\n\nThousands of other sods found themselves accused of counterfeiting as silver coins from across Cannor began to change. It didn’t take long for people to figure out that all these coins had a common connection: us. Each and every affected coin was forged in our mints that sourced from the mines of Yfelorr.\n\nWe don’t know what happened to the merchant or the other unfortunate souls caught in all of this. But, what we do know is that there is now a silver crisis due to this “Fey Silver”. And, we are at the epicenter of it!"

That should’ve been the end of that story. But, instead, some of those coins transmuted into an unknown lesser metal! The merchant was then arrested for fraud.

 deepwoods.39.t:0 "Shedding the Blood of Castan"
 deepwoods.39.d:0 "The Shadow Grove, Salla Ghul, is a place cloaked in perpetual darkness. The dense canopy of the great trees keeps the ground in perpetual twilight, the ground a mess of crunching pine needles where no plants can grow, so choked of sunlight by the towering pines. This alone has made the grove unpopular and sparsely populated. However, our administrators have far more serious concerns about the provinces there.\n\nLurking beneath the dark canopy of the Shadow Grove are a group of fey who are known as the Ashentree Pact. Vengeful and territorial, they were once worshippers and adherents of the World Tree that once stood in Oldhaven before the Castanorians burned the tree millenia ago. The destruction of the great tree turned the fey towards bloody vengeance, and as a group the Ashentree have a single-minded obsession with punishing humanity for their transgressions against the wood. To this end, they have sought to use any and all tools, including the mortal inhabitants of the Deepwoods, as weapons in their crusade. \n\nIt has been some time since the Ashentree have troubled us directly, but a small group has recently appeared to the governor of [Root.Province.GetName] with a message for our government. Apparently, they are demanding that we bring war against the blood of Castan as payment for dwelling in the grove that they call theirs. They demand us to attack and raze the settlements of humans in [TARGET], to be their tool of retribution."

 deepwoods.39.b:0 "We do not take demands from perfidious fey!"
 deepwoods.40.t:0 "The Harrowing Bone-Hoarders"
 deepwoods.40.d:0 "The Bone Grove earned its name due to the sheer number of discarded bones that line its floors. There are so many bones that they are often more an encumbrance than mud or foliage! However, on occasion, parts of the grove can be found picked clean of any bones. If one were to foolishly search for where these bones went they would find Bone Towers, bizarre towering structures made up of nothing but bone. After which, one would spot the tower’s creators, the Bone-Hoarders.\n\nIndescribable in shape or size, Bone-Hoarders are fey whose very presence can shatter the psyche. This is because mortals that come close to Bone-Hoarders are subject to repeated intrusive thoughts of self harm and death. If exposed for too long, the victims often act on these thoughts.\n\nIt is for this reason that the governor of [deepwoods_bonehoarders_province.GetName] is distressed to report an unusually large gathering of Bone-Hoarders. They are requesting aid to drive the creatures away or at least help move citizens before any harm can come."
 deepwoods.40.a:0 "Tell the small folk and travelers to avoid the Bone-Hoarders. This will end eventually."

 deepwoods.42.t:0 "The Legacy of the Remnant Fleet"
 deepwoods.42.d:0 "It has been centuries since the elves first arrived in Cannor on the Remnant Fleet. For the Wood Elves, it has been over a millenia. Yet, even after all that time, the memory of the Fleet hasn’t faded from Wood Elf culture. Today is proof of that.\n\nFor today, on the shores of Silent Lake, throngs of elves from across the Deepwoods crowd and teem. Forgotten are any clan feuds or rivalries. Instead, the air is charged with excitement and energy. \n\nAnd on the lake itself is an ecliptic mix of dinghies, canoes, and yachts. None of these diminutive vessels can compare to any of the ships that brought their ancestors across. But, strangely when taken together, the hodgepodge does strike a vague, miniaturized, resemblance to the Remnant Fleet.\n\nAs a horn sounds. Moments later, the various vessels set off. The race to reach the distant shore across the lake has begun.\n\nPerhaps a bet can be made here?"
 deepwoods.42.a:0 "The scruffy captain of the dinghy is sure to win!"
 deepwoods.42.b:0 "The canoe there is well built. A certain winner!"
 deepwoods.42.c:0 "What vessel can compare to that fine yacht? An easy victory."

In the coming hours, a steady stream of boats find themselves greeted by the same elated crowd.\n\nAs day turns to night and the feasting subsides, the no longer sober elves gather around the victorious captain. The crowd erupts one last time as an elderly elf places a wreath of Moon Lilies upon the captain’s head. This year’s Moonsinger has been crowned!"

 deepwoods.46.t:0 "The Evergrowing Citadel of Ciranmyna"
 deepwoods.46.d:0 "The formidable citadel city of Ciranmyna didn’t start off that way. At its founding, Ciranmyna was nothing more than shoddy hovels occupied by miserable and lost Moon Elves atop a mountain. In the centuries that followed, both Ciranmyna and elves evolved. Moon elves became Wood Elves and Ciranmyna expanded to meet the needs of these new peoples.  When space atop the mountain ran out, the elves turned to gently weaving new buildings into the rock itself. And with each new spurt of growth, Ciranmyna was woven further and further across the mountain. The effort was always both time and resource consuming, but it was always worth the effort.\n\nNow some local elves have decided that it is time once more to expand Ciranmnya. Plans have been drawn, workers and mages contracted, and now there is just the matter of paying for all of this. \n\nWe can rest assured that the city is rich enough that the locals can fund it themselves. But, the extra tax won’t make anyone happy. On the other hand, we could aid them in the effort. The locals rather zealously promised the benefits would be worth the cost."
 deepwoods.46.a:0 "Local efforts should be funded with local funds."
 deepwoods.46.b:0 "Ciranmyna is certainly a fine investment!"
 deepwoods.46.c:0 "Ciranmyna was our ancestors’ first home. Of course, we will fund its growth!"
 deepwoods.47.t:0 "Lives Long Passed"
 deepwoods.47.d:0 "There are places in the Bone Grove where time slips. Where, or really when, the past becomes the present. In those moments, long extinct beasts can be seen roaming the glades. Behind them, in silence, great warriors long forgotten stalk their prey.\n\nSuch events are usually fleeting, playing out without witness. But in [Root.Province.GetName], locals have been reporting seeing such scenes on the daily. Who knows how long these scenes will last, but it seems we have a chance to capitalize this.\n\nOn one side, our generals believe our recruits could learn a thing or two from these past apparitions. On the other hand, a minister has suggested sending someone from the Order of Chroniclers to record this occurrence."
 deepwoods.47.a:0 "Learning from the past is key to understanding the future. Send the recruits."
 deepwoods.47.b:0 "The Chroniclers are going to love this!"
 deepwoods.48.t:0 "Floral Bloom"
 deepwoods.48.d:0 "In the Flower Grove, one can find innumerable plants and flowers unique to the grove. Most of these flora, as diverse in shape and size as they are vibrant color, are quite deadly when handled improperly. But, with careful hands, they can produce both exquisite dyes and deadly poisons.\n\nDue to the generally fleeting nature of the flora, most of these dyes and poisons find themselves in short supply. However, this year has seen an usually vibrant bloom of plant life. News of this bloom hasn’t yet reached the artisans and potion makers from across our lands. Doubtless, they are eager to travel and take part in bountiful harvest. The question is who should we favor with news?"
 deepwoods.48.a:0 "The most beautiful dyes shall make the most wonderful profit! Inform the artisans!"
 deepwoods.48.b:0 "Potions and poisons are always needed. Especially by our spies..."
 deepwoods.49.t:0 "A Cross-Time Caper - Lost regiment"
 deepwoods.49.d:0 "We have received a report indicating that an entire regiment has gone missing while on assignment in the Deepwoods. While it is not uncommon for individual soldiers to become lost in that treacherous terrain, whether due to fey trickery or dense underbrush, it is highly unusual for such a large group to vanish simultaneously.\n\nIn response, we declared a state of emergency and dispatched multiple patrols to locate and rescue them, should they have been ambushed. Experienced trackers discovered their trail in a seldom-tread area of [forward_send.GetName], but their tracks abruptly ceased. Despite exhaustive efforts, our subsequent searches have yielded no discernible results."
 deepwoods.49.a:0 "Will we ever see them again?"
 deepwoods.50.t:0 "A Cross-Time Caper - Missing soldiers return"
 deepwoods.50.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it is a miracle! Our troops, long believed lost in the depths of the Deepwoods, have suddenly emerged near [forward_receive.GetName]! They were found approaching a guard post, donning outdated gear and uniforms.Their knowledge of old passwords raised suspicions among the guards, who initially suspected subterfuge. However, upon securing the common soldiers and interrogating the officers, it became evident that they were indeed our long-lost comrades, who vanished without a trace during a routine maneuver many years ago. They told us that to them, it was like no time had passed between then and now.\n\nNow, we face a decision regarding their fate. They have been escorted to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], and we are presented with two options: either we provide them with updated training and reintegrate them into active duty, or we assign them to the reserves, affording them some well-deserved rest and time to readjust to the future."
 deepwoods.50.a:0 "They deserve some time."
 deepwoods.50.b:0 "They are soldiers and belong on the battlefield."
 deepwoods.51.t:0 "A Cross-Time Caper - Reinforcements from the future"
 deepwoods.51.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], something very peculiar has happened in [backward_receive.GetName]: a full regiment of soldiers suddenly appeared, donning equipment bearing our insignia, yet displaying notable modifications compared to our current gear. They adamantly assert their kinship to us, yet their claims are accompanied by references to high ranking officers who, in actuality, are far too young to hold such positions in the army. Our thorough investigation suggests that they are indeed our own troops, sent back from the future by some kind of unknown force.\n\nSome officers advocate harnessing their knowledge to train our armies in updated tactics, while others propose deploying them as frontline warriors, fulfilling their true purpose. The decision lies with you, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 deepwoods.51.a:0 "Make them train our other troops."
 deepwoods.51.b:0 "Send them to the frontlines!"
 deepwoods.52.t:0 "A Cross-Time Caper - Backwards through time"
 deepwoods.52.d:0 "A long-anticipated event has finally unfolded before us, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The regiment composed of the present counterparts to the troops who once reinforced us from the future has failed to report back following a field exercise in [backward_send.GetName]. Our search parties have reported a peculiar discovery: the tracks of the regiment abruptly vanish within a forest clearing, as if spirited away by some unknown magicks.\n\nIt had come to our attention that all the soldiers who emerged from the future gradually converged upon this very regiment, almost appearing to be guided by an external influence. In an attempt to avert the current situation, we considered dispersing the regiment. However, our most highly educated advisor cautioned us against tampering with the delicate balance of "causality", and emphasized the perils of trying to trick fate."
