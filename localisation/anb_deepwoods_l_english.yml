 I45_cluster_1_title:0 "Lake Grove"
 I45_cluster_1_desc:0 "The Silent Lake of Clan Elyn has long been known as one of the most tranquil groves, at least along the shores. Elynáyle, the traditional capital has long been a place for elves to live out nostalgic memories of days in the remnant fleet. Its inhabitants have long spent their days sailing across the placid waters and fishing the bountiful waters to their hearts' content. Despite what one would expect of the Fey Forest, the open waters of the lake itself hold no significant threats to life or limb.\n\nThe southern shore is noted for a swampier character, with looming mangrove-like leviathans towering from the waters, creating a tangle of roots far more perilous than the open waters. The southernmost part of the grove, near Sáwelahain has long been a goblin stronghold, though the lake's shore has remained elven since the initial conquests."
 I45_cluster_2_title:0 "Mountain Grove"
 I45_cluster_2_desc:0 "The Mountain Grove of Clan Myna has long been appreciated as the one place where the land pierces the heavens, breaks free from the oppressive darkness of the forest's canopies. Their proud mountain home is carved from the caves in which the frightened elves, trapped within the forest first sheltered. Its caverns and slopes hold numerous hand-hewn dwellings that have been continuously inhabited for nearly the whole of the elves' tenure in the wood.\n\nThe Myna have long stood as a beacon of the Wood Elves' culture, above the rest in both valor and elevation. The woods of the grove are largely unremarkable, more peaceful than most thanks to their proximity to the forest's edge. Though it should be minded, "peaceful" may be quite a different measure in the Deepwoods."
 I45_cluster_3_title:0 "Thorn Grove"
 I45_cluster_3_desc:0 "The Thorngrove of Drennen lies at the center of the Deepwoods. It stands as perhaps the most overtly menacing part of the forest. While brambles and spines are nothing unusual in any part of the wood, even the trees take on a warped and thorny appearance this deep in the groves. While quite thoroughly cleansed of goblins and other rivals to the elves, the region was perhaps one of the most tightly held by the Fey. The spirits' sway has long been quite firm with pathways, and even whole villages seeming to phase in and out of the material plane on a whim."
 I45_cluster_4_title:0 "Bone Grove"
 I45_cluster_4_desc:0 "The Bone Grove has long been the home of Clan Cenág, one of the least numerous but tightest knit of the elves' clans. Though every wood elf quickly learns to navigate the tangle of roots and ferns that make up the Deepwood's paths, in the Bone Grove, they are forced to also learn to keep their balance when discarded femurs and tibias are added to that mix, and to mind the dens of bones and skulls at the center of many a clearing. Despite the danger of the bone-hoarders that inhabit these strange dwellings, this grove also has long held one of the greatest concentrations of goblins remaining in the forest."
 I45_cluster_5_title:0 "Flower Grove"
 I45_cluster_5_desc:0 "A name like the "Flower Grove" would surely put the mind at ease… Wouldn't it be one of the loveliest of the wood? With those softly glowing bulbs lending it light, with the vibrant colors of the ever-blooming flowers. The Scotha would call it lovely indeed. But who doesn't adore their home? Few others would, as the flowers were important enough to earn the grove's name only thanks to the great danger they pose.\n\nEvery inhabitant of the grove need make themselves a botanist, perhaps even an alchemist for the ease with which one could find danger in its beautiful flora. From friendly-looking fruits that can rot the gut, to pollens that set all manner of strange hazes over the mind, even a poorly judged step can find thorns filled with Cannor's most potent toxins ripping through the sole of a traveler's boot."
 I45_cluster_6_title:0 "Hunter's Grove"
 I45_cluster_6_desc:0 "The Hunter's Grove is home to the mightiest, most twisted beasts of the Deepwoods. Those who dare to try and tame it soon grow into warriors that rival even the forest's orcish invaders in their might. Providing they survive, of course. Home to Clan Fealgarn, the grove provides perhaps the most sporting hunts in all of Cannor. The giant malformed pets of the Fey crash through the woods, splintering the ancient trees as they stalk their prey with venomous claws, with rows of teeth so numerous that one could hardly take count before they're taken into them. "
 I45_cluster_7_title:0 "Arrow Grove"
 I45_cluster_7_desc:0 "The Arrow Grove of the Ayeth's exact etymology is disputed. Is it for the fine wood employed in the crafting of arrows? Or is it the fact that arrows have long been the only reliable weapon, when a single misstep upon the treacherous ground could send one plunging to their demise? The limestone caverns beneath this part of the wood have eroded the forest floor into a maze of caverns, tunnels and gullies too treacherous for navigation.\n\nIt's far safer to traverse the canopy, bounding through the branches, swinging along vines, than to risk the treacherous maze below, where one misstep could send you down as long a fall as one from the canopy to firm ground. Even most of the Fey are reticent to trespass the treacherous earth of the grove, for the horrors that lurk beneath it promise some of the most torturous fates that the natural world offers outside the Effelai Jungle."
 I45_cluster_8_title:0 "River Grove"
 I45_cluster_8_desc:0 "Perhaps the most sincerely tranquil and pleasant of the groves, at least in days past, the River grove Ahain was, until the coming of the Greentide, a rare bastion of natural harmony in the Deepwoods. Elves, goblins, and some of the Woods' most prominent populations of satyr lived peacefully side by side. It is even rumored that a few remaining ancestors of the centaurs had been sighted living peacefully there, from time to time.\n\nThe region long held some of the least ireful of the Fey, resulting in the land's disposition to groves of bountiful fruits, and rivers teeming with an abundance of fish, around which most settlements were clustered. As the forest recovers from the orcish assault, one can only pray that this peace and abundance might return."
 I45_cluster_9_title:0 "Shadow Grove"
 I45_cluster_9_desc:0 "Ghul, the Shadow Grove. Home to the clan of that name, this remote corner of the forest had long been the black sheep of the Deepwoods. Shaded by the embrace of the Serpentspine's towering peaks on two sides, and an impenetrably thick canopy of black leaves above, the region was pitch black, with even the Jorkad river's headwaters wholly shaded in their flow, not a ray of light to be seen along its desperately rushing waters.\n\nThe grim elves of Ghul are rumored not only to appease the Unseelie, in their perversions and dark whimsy, but even to take travelers in appeasement of the viciously misanthropic Ashentree Fey, their dark practices a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."
 I45_securize_the_border_title:0 "Secure the Border"
 I45_securize_the_border_desc:0 "Following the emergence of the Greentide, many of the gladeways leading into the Deepwoods were abandoned. We must remedy this by establishing control over the outward paths. In doing so, we will ensure the safety and security of the Deepwoods from other potential outside invaders."
 I45_the_oak_guard_title:0 "The Oak Guard"
 I45_the_oak_guard_desc:0 "Having assumed control of the outer gladeways, we should re-institute the Oak Guard. This unit will maintain a constant vigilance upon the paths leading into the Deepwoods, thus ensuring that our lands will be adequately defended from any who would dare try to trespass into our wooded homeland."
 I45_cyranvar_renaissance_title:0 "Cyranvar Renaissance"
 I45_cyranvar_renaissance_desc:0 "The decision to improve the capital has proven providential. Even now, throngs of traders and other peoples from across Cannor have begun to engage with our realm en masse. We should ensure that this engagement will be beneficial for the state by adopting any of the customs or institutions that the outside world has innovated upon."
 I45_develop_infrastructure_title:0 "Develop Infrastructure"
 I45_develop_infrastructure_desc:0 "The destruction wrought by the Greentide has left the Deepwoods devastated. If we are to having any hope of creating a state capable of withstanding the threats that surround us, we must reverse this. Develop the realm so that our ancestors might be proud, and our enemies wary of thinking about thoughts of invasion!"
 I45_promote_education_title:0 "Promote Education"
 I45_promote_education_desc:0 "The ever-growing needs of the state require an almost inexhaustible amount of well educated bureaucrats. In order to ensure that our population is able to fill this demand, we will establish institutes of higher learning throughout Cyranvar."
 I45_only_the_best_title:0 "Only the Best"
 I45_only_the_best_desc:0 "Our decision to pursue a policy of enforced isolation is predicated on maintaining a highly elite standing army. While everyone is expected to undergo military training so that they might be called up in times of dire need, only the best among us are fit to serve in the standing army. This ensures that we have a serious military edge over our rivals, but this also means that filling our ranks to replace our fallen soldiers is difficult."
 I45_a_safe_country_title:0 "A Safe Country"
 I45_a_safe_country_desc:0 "As part of our ongoing policy of isolation, leading figures in our military establishment have called for the adoption of a strategy of preemptive engagement. They argue that striking beyond our borders to quell rising threats is superior to a policy of reactive defensiveness. The veracity of their argument has struck a chord with the High King. We must crush whatever threats emerge before they can harm our homeland!"
 I45_the_model_elf_title:0 "The Model Elf"
 I45_the_model_elf_desc:0 "In deciding to pursue isolation, our state has needed to thoroughly educated the populace about the benefits of this. Part of this education is rooted in a policy of mandatory service, known colloquially as the "Model Elf" program. Our citizens know that only by being wholly devoted to Cyranvar will the state prosper,and the security of the country be preserved. This ensures that we enjoy certain economic and military benefits that most states lack."
 I45_demand_the_oak_oath_title:0 "Demand the Oak Oath"
 I45_demand_the_oak_oath_desc:0 "The destruction of the orcish invaders has put us in the position of foremost prominence among the remaining Wood Elven states. We shall demand an oath of fealty from the remaining Kings in order to unite our people for the first time in history. Any who might foolishly decline this generous offer will be brought to heel by force."
 I45_a_capital_city_title:0 "A Capital City"
 I45_a_capital_city_desc:0 "As Cyranvar coalesces into a true state, our capital is sorely lacking compared to the other great cities of Cannor. If we are to truly assume a new found position of importance, we must renovate the capital to reflect the future orientation of our glorious state."
 I45_toward_the_future_title:0 "Toward the Future"
 I45_toward_the_future_desc:0 "The unification of the Deepwoods and the establishment of the Oak Monarchy affords our King the unique opportunity of deciding upon the direction of the Wood Elven people. Hardliners among us advocate for a policy of strict isolation to ensure that something like the Greentide will never happen again. Those with more liberal attitudes see the wonders that Cannor has to offer and argue for the adoption of a more open policy. Both directions will have serious consequences for the future of Cyranvar, choose wisely eminence!"
 I45_remember_the_fallen_title:0 "Remember the Fallen"
 I45_remember_the_fallen_desc:0 "As Cyranvar continues to develop, we mustn't ever forget our ancestors. Through their selfless sacrifice were our people saved. If not for them, then the Greentide would have destroyed us. As the kingdom develops we must commemorate their bravery through great works erected in their honour."
 I45_economic_boom_title:0 "Economic Boom"
 I45_economic_boom_desc:0 "Food on every table! Our economic policies have proven to be a resounding success. The economy has reached levels of prosperity we thought impossible, and the state will greatly benefit from this!"
 I45_silvar_ishu_title:0 "Silvar Ishu"
 I45_silvar_ishu_desc:0 "In choosing to isolate ourselves from Cannor, we have come to develop a relationship rooted in equilibrium with the Deepwoods. All of the actions of our Kingdom are rooted in respecting the limits and boundaries of our forested homeland. This has greatly deepened our ties with the feys and spirits of the land, who have taken to calling us the "Silvar Ishu" or Children of the Forest."
 I45_to_another_forest_title:0 "To Another Forest"
 I45_to_another_forest_desc:0 "In the last thousand plus years, elvenkind in the Deepwoods has never seen such prosperity. With wealth this comes new ambitions. New desires to push boundaries. Such boldness has led one adventurer to a place no elf has been... the heart of the Deepwoods."
 I45_under_the_canopy_title:0 "Under the Canopy"
 I45_under_the_canopy_desc:0 "Beneath the shadowed canopy of the Deepwoods, our people thrive! Centuries have passed since the devastation of the Greentide, yet thanks to our beneficent rule, Cyranvar is now the envy of Cannor. Our economy is burgeoning, trade continues to blossom and none would dare to challenge our military might! Never again shall the Wood Elves suffer under the yoke of foreign invaders, for we have assumed our rightful position among the peoples of the world!"
 I45_toward_unification_title:0 "Toward Unification"
 I45_toward_unification_desc:0 "While Cyranvar is by far the most dominant realm in the Deepwoods, we have yet to exert full control over our homeland. We must remedy this by bringing any who might resist our designs into submission. Only through unification might we hope to achieve our rightful place in Cannor."
 I45_a_united_deepwoods_title:0 "United Deepwoods"
 I45_a_united_deepwoods_desc:0 "Through countless wars and great struggle, we have managed to unite the entirety of the Deepwoods under our rule. Plans have begun to emerge to elevate the status of our newly unified realm, time will tell what direction our state shall pursue."
 I45_a_high_king_title:0 "A High King"
 I45_a_high_king_desc:0 "Successfully uniting the entire of our wooded homeland has allowed our monarch to truly assume a position of importance. The Oak Monarchy has been established, heralding in a new chapter for our people under the illustrious rule of the High King of the Wood Elves."
 I45_the_keys_to_rule_title:0 "The Keys to Rule"
 I45_the_keys_to_rule_desc:0 "With the progression of time, and the evolution of political and cultural attitudes, our state now finds itself at a crossroads. Serious division has arisen among the people over the nature of the Oak Monarchy. Some advocate for the High King to assume a position of absolute authority, ensuring that the state remains strong. Other suggests that a parliament or some other delegative body be established, lessening the power of the King and handing over authority to elected officials. They argue that this would ensure the monarch remains legitimate, and will allow for the development of a more dynamic state. Regardless of the direction the King chooses, a decision must be made now."
 I45_develop_artisanat_title:0 "Develop Artisanat"
 I45_develop_artisanat_desc:0 "In choosing to pursue a policy of openness, we must ensure that our economy doesn't become dominated by our neighbours. To avert this potential economic slavery, the kingdom will intervene wherever necessary to ensure the development of a strong, thriving Cyranvar no matter the cost."
 I45_centralize_money_printing_title:0 "Centralize Money Printing"
 I45_centralize_money_printing_desc:0 "Our policy of supporting the Artisanat has been a resounding success. Yet despite this, private money suppliers exert an undue influence upon our economy which is a growing concern. We must exert our control by becoming the sole supplier of currency. This will ensure that money continues to flow, though we may run into some challenges..."
 I45_one_of_many_title:0 "One of Many"
 I45_one_of_many_desc:0 "In pursuing a policy of openness, our people have come to value trade and production above all else. As a result, the influence exerted by the mercantile classes has led to a qualitative change upon our culture, this is most evident in military affairs. In times of war, all are expected to serve and to do their duty, yet no room is afforded for bravado or individual greatness. Every soldier is but one of many."
 I45_expert_artisan_title:0 "Expert Artisans"
 I45_expert_artisan_desc:0 "The skill of our artisans is incomparable. Nowhere across Cannor can one find individuals of comparable quality. The Artisans have proven to be a resounding success, as the future generations are able to continue to improve upon the skills inherited from their masters."
 I45_the_cosmopolitan_elf_title:0 "The Cosmopolitan Elf"
 I45_the_cosmopolitan_elf_desc:0 "Our ancestors traditions proved incapable of adapting to the rapidly changing world around us. In seeking to open our borders and engage with the continent at large, our economy has thrived and a more egalitarian society has developed. No longer shall any individual feel beholden to time honoured traditions. Instead we are a truly cosmopolitan people, willing and able to adopt the best practices of all cultures."
 I45_internal_trade_title:0 "Internal Trade"
 I45_internal_trade_desc:0 "The opening of the Deepwoods has seriously hindered our ability to profit from the fruits of our labour. If we are to have any hope of seeing trade thrive in our land, we must limit the ability of foreign merchants to exploit our resources. We must adopt whatever means necessary to advantage our merchants and limit the ability of predatory foreign merchants to exploit us."
 I45_a_protectionism_approach_title:0 "A Protectionist Approach"
 I45_a_protectionism_approach_desc:0 "Our measures to protect internal trade have proven to be inadequate.

She offers her pristine hand, lips curling into a smile, teeth bared. Her robe of leaves and ivy begins to slip. There is a choice to be made, here and now, one that will determine the future of [Root.GetName]. But is it a choice at all?"

Yet in all that time, we’ve worked to avoid straying too far from trodden paths. Stories passed down from grandparent to grandchild have cautioned against taking one step too far.\n\nThey were stories well told. We were a scattered people without hardly any comprehension of what the Feyrealm even was. Our relationships with its Fey denizens were… still being established. Simply put, we were not ready for extra-planar exploration. But, now? We are one people with generations of experiences with our neighboring plane. Its inhabitants are no longer seen as fickle and impetuous, but understood as flexible and eager.\n\nAnd now one of our own has found a new path.\n\nThe adventurous Wood Elf known as Vucras Siubálrn (‘’Vucras the Traveler’’), has discovered a reliable means through the Feyrealm. This path appears to lead to another forest, one in our own plane! This has caused quite a stir in the court and has led to courtiers urging us to officially fund expeditions with Vucras at the lead."

For today carries a story not of wondrous discovery but of mortal squabbles.\n\nThe mysterious Feyrealm-connected forest holds elves just like ours. But they are… different. With their exotic skin colors, strange tongues and bizarre customs, it seems like we hold more apart than together. Indeed, perhaps for that reason, these elves are intensely hostile. Our intrepid explorer has reported that skirmishes with these wayward elves are increasingly common."

For all their fragility and beauty, their presence oft means suffering and death. I still recall the first tragedy borne of the butterfly. It came at the wings of the Alyana Blue, who emerge from their cocoons every 90 years to mate for one week before returning to their long slumber.\n\nThey descended upon the adolescent trainees busy practicing their side steps who - in their ignorant youth - did not flee at blue cloud head toward them, but instead got closer to observe this phenomenon. Upon the butterflies landing on trainees, the glade was soon filled with the plagued screams of tortured souls. Where the butterflies rested, multiple pustules erupted with fountains of blood. Moments later, their teeth began to rot as their eyes… no, I shall not desecrate their bodies further by describing the horrors. Truly, butterflies are some of the cruelest creations of the Herald of Change.\n\nIt has taken weeks, but I have tallied the losses of that week across our grove.

Indeed, during the time of the Verdant Veil, the fey seemed to have moved the freest there, able to pass from their maddening realm into ours at will. People could also move the other direction, and there are many tales and records of travelers accidentally slipping through into the Fey realm. In the most extreme cases,  entire villages would simply disappear without a trace, buildings and people all.\n\nWith the Verdant Veil gone, there were some who had hoped such events would cease. These hopes were dashed, when reports came in that multiple settlements have seemingly vanished in [deepwoods_disappeared_villages_province.GetName]. The shock of these disappearances has come down hard on relatives of the missing, and search parties were sent out to look for any signs  But the vanished hamlets have left no trace - the ground where they once stood is now wild woodland bearing no signs that anyone ever lived there at all."

Almost exactly where they had disappeared, the villages have returned. Once again small cottages can be found nested atop the dense wood and the sounds of rural life once again hum alongside the quiet tune of wildlife. \n\nThe joyous news swept the surrounding countryside, and people flocked to the lost villages - some to gawk, others to search for lost loved ones. Celebrations quickly turned muted, however, when differences began to be noticed . To start, not everyone seems to have returned, and those who have returned have been described by their former friends and relatives as… different than before. They all bear marks of being feytouched - some more manic, others dreary, others possessed by strange humor and still others moving about as if in a haze.

In the dark depths below the surface, the miners claim that there are terrifying fey beasts and whispers that torment the mine, and it was impossible to stay below for extended periods.\n\nRecently, several new caverns have appeared that hold great promise. After a cautious exploration, our people have returned excitedly to announce they are full of rich silver veins waiting for exploitation - if only we bring the tools and light the dark tunnels. This is surely a great opportunity for the nation."

This alone has made the grove unpopular and sparsely populated. However, our administrators have far more serious concerns about the provinces there.\n\nLurking beneath the dark canopy of the Shadow Grove are a group of fey who are known as the Ashentree Pact. Vengeful and territorial, they were once worshippers and adherents of the World Tree that once stood in Oldhaven before the Castanorians burned the tree millenia ago. The destruction of the great tree turned the fey towards bloody vengeance, and as a group the Ashentree have a single-minded obsession with punishing humanity for their transgressions against the wood. To this end, they have sought to use any and all tools, including the mortal inhabitants of the Deepwoods, as weapons in their crusade. \n\nIt has been some time since the Ashentree have troubled us directly, but a small group has recently appeared to the governor of [Root.Province.GetName] with a message for our government. Apparently, they are demanding that we bring war against the blood of Castan as payment for dwelling in the grove that they call theirs.

However, on occasion, parts of the grove can be found picked clean of any bones. If one were to foolishly search for where these bones went they would find Bone Towers, bizarre towering structures made up of nothing but bone. After which, one would spot the tower’s creators, the Bone-Hoarders.\n\nIndescribable in shape or size, Bone-Hoarders are fey whose very presence can shatter the psyche. This is because mortals that come close to Bone-Hoarders are subject to repeated intrusive thoughts of self harm and death. If exposed for too long, the victims often act on these thoughts.\n\nIt is for this reason that the governor of [deepwoods_bonehoarders_province.GetName] is distressed to report an unusually large gathering of Bone-Hoarders.

Today is proof of that.\n\nFor today, on the shores of Silent Lake, throngs of elves from across the Deepwoods crowd and teem. Forgotten are any clan feuds or rivalries. Instead, the air is charged with excitement and energy. \n\nAnd on the lake itself is an ecliptic mix of dinghies, canoes, and yachts. None of these diminutive vessels can compare to any of the ships that brought their ancestors across. But, strangely when taken together, the hodgepodge does strike a vague, miniaturized, resemblance to the Remnant Fleet.\n\nAs a horn sounds. Moments later, the various vessels set off.

At its founding, Ciranmyna was nothing more than shoddy hovels occupied by miserable and lost Moon Elves atop a mountain. In the centuries that followed, both Ciranmyna and elves evolved. Moon elves became Wood Elves and Ciranmyna expanded to meet the needs of these new peoples.  When space atop the mountain ran out, the elves turned to gently weaving new buildings into the rock itself. And with each new spurt of growth, Ciranmyna was woven further and further across the mountain. The effort was always both time and resource consuming, but it was always worth the effort.\n\nNow some local elves have decided that it is time once more to expand Ciranmnya. Plans have been drawn, workers and mages contracted, and now there is just the matter of paying for all of this. \n\nWe can rest assured that the city is rich enough that the locals can fund it themselves. But, the extra tax won’t make anyone happy. On the other hand, we could aid them in the effort. The locals rather zealously promised the benefits would be worth the cost."

Not only this, but the land is also rather arid, with the sun’s heat becoming particularly unbearable by midday. Unprepared for this, the expedition had begun to falter. Disaster, however, was averted thanks to the intervention of winged feminine creatures of, given the gratuitous detail, great beauty. While initially believed to be wayward fey, these "harpies" were apparently and curiously ignorant of either the Seelie or Unseelie.\n\nUpon being taken to one of their "roosts" atop a mountain to recover, the expeditionaries were surprised to find not only additional harpies but also non-harpies too. There they spotted dark skinned orcs much unlike the green ones familiar to us, hardy humans tending flocks, and even strange elves from land known as Bulwar! As it would turn out, this collection of races were the "mates" of the harpies.\n\nThe harpies would prove to be "gracious hosts" while the expedition recovered.

There, they were stumbled upon by passing merchants who took pity on them. What ensued was a journey unlike any other.\n\nTheir journey took them south to the land of Ourdia, where ancient fortifications like the one in which the expeditionaries sheltered  dotted the land.

Later, they encountered communities of humans and "Sun Elves", elves who are apparently distant cousins of our own forebears. And though they did not get to see it, they were told of a city known as Ovdal Tûngr, dug deep into the southern mountains themselves where the "Copper Dwarves" resided.\n\nBut none of that compared to the sight of "where the land ended and water began".

 deepwoods.60.d:0 "The mysterious forests of the Deepwoods teem with both life and death, a verdant stage upon which the cycle of nature has played out since the dawn of time - if such a thing can be said of a place a so deeply under the influence of the Fey. There is one more than any other who embodies these laws, a great and terrible archfey of the Seelie Court. The wood elves, first tenants of the glades, know him as Arsydbadhál, the Old Wolf. The warlike green orcs learned quickly to respect his domain, and named him Asgud-Domd, Master of the Hunt, while the clever goblins simply called him Prezmorzmept, Death’s Grasp. Such labels serve as but a warning of the Lord of Beast’s mastery over the woods, as he again and again stalks the glades, in search of ever more fearsome game.\n\nThe scales of nature demand balance, however, and the Lord himself must be both predator and prey. According to legend, the Lord of Beasts will leave signs of his presence, an open invitation to the bravest and most resourceful hunters. At first, rumors of his mark appearing were dismissed as coincidence, but the truth can no longer be denied - he has summoned you to [hunt_location.GetName]."

Courtiers and advisors huddle together a stone’s throw, skeptical and yet terrified. A towering oak bears the mark, matching the reports from the garrison: four cuts, deep and wide, cleave down the face of the tree, each equally terrible, but clearly made in one stroke. The wet air seems to wrap itself around you, covering your skin in a beaded blanket of moisture… or perhaps sweat. He is waiting."

As you raise your bow, the monster stops - and its gaze snaps directly to you - before it throws back its head and bellows a deafening roar, a call to battle that shakes your very soul. The Lord of Beasts explodes into a furious charge, maw foaming with rage."

You quickly glance back over your shoulder, unsure of your senses, and find yourself once again face to face with the nightmarish monster... and then the fear fades. As you survey his bulging muscles, scar-covered hide and razor claws, you see the cycle of life, stretching infinitely deep into the past and future, as eternal as it is bereft of malice. There is no evil here, no monsters but those of mortal invention, just a single destiny shared by all: to live, and then to die. A slight smile crosses your face, and the Lord of Beasts speaks:\n\n"You have proven yourself the greatest amongst your people, to have bested me.

Today it was Durzk’ungul and her damned elves from the bone-strewn lands to the south. Tomorrow? He and his warriors would march north and flush out the elf witch’s troops prodding at his clan’s land once more.\n\nThe orc paused, then gave a cold smile. His warriors. His clan.\n\nNot too long ago, he had simply been Khagor; a raider amongst the Greentide’s hordes, until he had broken an elven host by cutting down its leaders. His deathly smile widened. That had been a bloody and glorious day; the day Clan Sapchopper was declared with him as chieftain.\n\nHowever, since then, time had begun to blur. He often felt as though years had passed, even if he or his orcs did not show it. No doubt something to do with this cursed forest and that mist that had taken him.\n\nHe growled.\n\nOnce he and his orcs had hoped to escape these woods, to leave this Dookan-forsaken land and never return. But that hope had long since soured.\n\nThere was no escape. There was no going back.\n\nA weak groan cut through the orc’s musing. He looked down to find the source of the low sound. It was the elf he had cut down. The chieftain felt his smile return as he watched the elf try to crawl away, a trail of blood oozing behind them. After enjoying the sight a moment longer, he brought down his ax once more.\n\nIf Clan Sapchopper could not leave this forest, then it would break it and its inhabitants."

The bodies of warriors and villagers, elderly and children, covered the ground. The battle, no slaughter, had ended, but still the chieftain felt his blood boil. \n\n“Do you hear it, my warriors?” he bellowed.\n\nHis clan looked upon him with full attention.\n\n“It is the cries of our foes!”, he continued. “Listen to their panicked bleating. Listen to how they scurry knowing that their secret paths are ours now!”\n\nThe orcs hooted, laughing as some made mocking animal noises. Khagor waited for the clamor to die down before beginning once more.\n\n“Do you hear it, my warriors?” he cried again before howling.\n\nA chorus of howls joined his own.\n\n“It is the sound of war! Of victory!” Khagor shouted.\n\nThe howls grew louder.\n\n“No more raids! No more hiding!” He screamed. “Only true battle!”\n\nThe chieftain raised his arms, drinking in the cheers.

It was weak, much like its makers, but knowing it was part of the spoils of war made it worth downing. Both Durzk’ungul and the elf witch were dead, their clans scattered or enslaved.\n\nThe chieftain wiped his mouth and opened his eyes. When he saw nothing but white mists, he dropped the goblet. Khagor never heard its clatter. Gone was the ambient noise of his victorious clan.\n\nIt was just like the first time the mists had taken him. He was alone, blinded and deafened by this suffocating white blanket. Then, he felt something. Something… more.\n\n“Mighty Khagor,” an essence whispered. “Thou hast done well vanquishing thine foes. Truly thine strength is befit of thou’s creator’s vision.”\n\nThe words echoed in Khagor’s head, consuming his thoughts. A daze washed over him.\n\n“Consider, mighty warrior, that a chain binds you still. That thine kin and self remain shackled, denied thine true potential. Yet, thou mayst still be freed.”\n\nKhagor opened his mouth, but no words came. The world began to spin.\n\n“Behold thy hand.”\n\nDespite his fading vision, he felt compelled to look. There in his hand was his goblet once more.\n\n“A gift. A taste of what thou couldst possess - unshackled might. Thy and thine kin needst only drink.”\n\nThe chieftain blacked out. When he came to, he found himself standing once more amongst his cheering clan. They acted oblivious to his disappearance. For a moment, the orc considered blaming his drunkenness.

Fine!” \n\nIt took only a glance for Dhoulza to know which slave had caught Dugz's eye. Out of the throng of goblins, only one dared to look up and meet her eyes.\n\n“The runt, yeah?” \n\n“That’s right.”\n\nDhoulza gave a grunt of approval, “Fiery that one is. Heard they was all like that before.”\n\n“Aye, heard the same.” Dugz agreed before continuing. “Think the chieftain will let me have him?”\n\nHis fellow slaver shrugged."

And it was upon the quiet shores of Silent Lake that the elder Wood Elves spent their last years in contemplation.\n\nNo more.\n\nDreams of elven unity are but shattered rubble now, much like Everglow Halls themselves. Generations of elven heritage are now ashes like the Luminous Archive.

Together, they attempted to escape the Deepwoods. It was an attempt that ultimately failed. And in the time that followed, those who had not joined the Bloodytusks were swept away by the Greentide’s invasion.\n\nAll of this was history that was willingly left forgotten, until now. With our recent conquest of the old Bloodytusk lands in the Hunter’s Grove, there are veterans of our clan who have begun to recall their roots. While they proudly and loyally bear the Sapchopper name, these grizzled warriors have gone so far as to begin petitioning our Chieftain for the right to rule their old home.\n\nSuch arrangements of lesser clans ruling under greater ones are not unheard of. Agreeing would lend us a valuable stream of warriors and enable better use of the land, however it would come at the cost of some control.\n\nWhat say you, Chieftain?"

They passed as his own musings and yet… there was a familiarity to them. He stood uncertain for a moment before dismissing his unease. Slowly, he then returned his gaze to his city. His glorious city. \n\n“But there couldst be more.”\n\nHis head throbbed, yet he could not dismiss the thought. The city was not enough. Until now, he and his clan had settled for shoddy warcamps, planning only their next battle. If these woods were truly home, Sapchopper would need to make it so.\n\n“The time hast come to embrace these woods."\n\nKhagor paused."

And there is plenty of good hunting in the Hunter’s Grove.\n\nWith the grove’s conquest long behind us, and our control absolute, it is time we reap the land's bounty. Of course, the first to do so will be our chieftain, flanked by our clan’s finest warriors. With the weapons sharpened, the traps set, and the provisions prepared, there only remains one task - deciding our prey.\n\nTo the south roam the iron-scaled carapellars, easily able to crush an orc with its maws. Eastward are the hunting grounds of the eyrpiercers, whose shrieks can rupture a hunter’s ear more than forty paces away. Yet that pales in comparison to the Darkwood Terror - a shambling tree that has developed a taste for flesh. Many hunters have fallen to its cunning."

The wild movements only ensured its demise.\n\nKhaara swung her ax as soon as the chink in the fey’s iron-like scales exposed itself. She was rewarded with a gush of blood and a shrill shriek from the fey creature. Driven by adrenaline, she hacked again and again until finally the carapellar was still.\n\nShe sat upon a dead creature unbelieving, then gave a triumphant howl. The young orc was no longer a mere girl but had proven herself a true daughter of Clan Sapchopper. Now all she had to do was claim a trophy as proof.\n\nAfter the euphoria of victory had finally settled, Khaara rolled off the creature and set about breaking off her prey’s valuable hardened scales. In all, it took an hour of diligent work to produce the fair pile of scales, but it was worth it for the celebration she would receive.\n\nAs she turned to make the long trek home, Khaara froze, realizing she had forgotten to honor her success.

His greatest rivals were either dead or scattered. His position as chieftain was unquestioned. And for all of that, it meant nothing.\n\nHe sat slumped on his throne, disheveled and exhausted. It was the toll that night after night of sordid dreams took on the war chief. They were always the same, a consuming fire swallowing everything he had built in a crimson inferno, a thousand wretched figures watching as nothing but bitter ash claimed him and his clan, and then a hollow hatred seeping into his heart.\n\n“I’ve an idea or two on this.”\n\nThe chieftain stared at the mercenary before him. His council had scoured far and wide for answers to his curse. The closest they had come was Ruuk Elmscourge, the leader of a strange group of mercenaries.\n\n“An idea?” Khagor replied incredulously. “I expect results.”\n\n“And for the right price, you’ll get them.” The sellsword grunted back, unfazed.\n\nFor a moment, Khagor felt his old energy return, as fury rose within him in the face of such indolence. Then, he gave a tired laugh.\n\n“Finally, an orc with spine!” The chieftain exclaimed. “Fine, you will have your gold. And I will have my answers… or your head.”\n\nRuuk met his threat with a smile, “Good. I’ll get the boys moving.”\n\nHe turned to leave, entirely unconcerned with his audience, before pausing.

The orc knew better than to doubt his instincts. It was something his father never let him forget.\n\nAs he and his fellow sellswords followed the orc, Ruuk let his mind clear, focusing on nothing but his target.\n\nThe orc was unassuming, nondescript even. Take your eyes off of them, and you’d forget they were ever even there. It was just like the Whisperer, the false orc whose foul words had spelled doom for his clan.\n\nA bitterness welled up within Ruuk from knowing that creature was on the prowl once more. Its machinations had brought the Greentide to a halt; ruined him and more. Now, it sought something from the strongest of the orc clans.\n\n“Shit, lost him.”\n\nRuuk blinked at his companion’s words. Sure enough the presence was gone. Even now he strained to recall what he had even been looking for.\n\n“Sorry boss.”\n\nHe shook his head with a smile, “Naw. You did good.

Here?”\n\n“So it seems.” Ruuk answered, examining the fey-marked land.\n\n“Ain’t no path I’ve seen.”\n\n“Hmm.”\n\n“So now what, boss?”\n\nFor a moment, Ruuk considered stepping forward. The handful of skulkers with him regarded their leader wearily, sensing his half-thought.\n\n“You’re not planning on getting us lost in the Feyrealm again, are ya?”\n\nHe shook his head, “Once was enough.”\n\nThere was a quiet collective sigh of relief.\n\n“Then what now?”\n\nRuuk frowned, racking his mind. There were only two ways to chart an uncharted gladeway. The first was trial and error. That wasn’t going to happen. The second was to acquire a wayfare of some kind, a grounding object that could help him navigate the Feyrealm. But where would he get that?\n\n“Boss?” a skulker asked, seeing the growing frown on Ruuk's face."

Back in the Shadow Grove. Back in Clan Silentblade. Back to his people.\n\nBut… they weren’t his people. Not anymore. They wore their faces, yes, but they were different. Changed. They glowed with a vibrant green hue. Regarded the forest more than their fellow orc. He had failed them.\n\nWith a heavy heart, he retreated into the shadows. Sapchopper had made it possible for him to get this far, but the rest was up to him.\n\nHe clambered over the palisade and jumped from alley to alley. When arriving at his destination, Ruuk could feel his heart pounding. It was his father’s personal quarters. A lifetime ago this was where he had made his shameful escape. Now, this was where his redemption would finally begin.\n\nThe room itself was in poor order. Strewn across it were strange trinkets, feymarked materials, and pages of incomprehensible scribbles. All of them depicted a figure, slender, pale as ash. Despite the crudeness of the drawing, Ruuk could feel the figure’s stare. Written below were three words, “The Blackened Prince”.\n\nHe shuddered before beginning a frantic search. After too long, he found it, a small dark box made of elm. It had been long coveted by his father. Involuntarily, he spat to the side in anger. The great chieftain Troknar Silentblade, desperate for a small trinket."

Beneath it, the foliage seemed to dance before them, following the tune of an unseen chorus of creatures. Even the air itself felt alive, thick with a strange, vibrant energy. \n\nThis was the heart of the Deepwoods - where the Feyrealm crossed the Prime Material plane.\n\nYet, for such wonder, neither orc could heed any attention to it. Not when the two caught sight of a single slender ashen figure awaiting before them. They were an avatar of nature’s beauty, stirring the most primitive of instincts.\n\n“The Blackened Prince…” Ruuk whispered.\n\nNever had Khagor heard such a name. But, somehow his heart knew it. The Prince smiled at him, as though reading his mind, leaving him chilled. How could such a soft sight stir such fear within him?\n\n“Yes, Wondrous Wanderer, Chivalrous Conqueror.” The Prince spoke. “It was mine own voice.”\n\nThe chieftain stared dumbfounded as he recalled the dark whispers that had filled his mind all these years."

The words seemed so distant.\n\n“What thou hast is…\n\nBut the palest shadow of true power.”\n\n“Khagor!” Ruuk screamed. “Do not let them claim you like they claimed my clan!”\n\n“Thou hast done well by your creator’s image.\n\nYet, their time hath long passed.\n\nT’is the moment to break free.\n\nEmbrace me.”\n\nRuuk roared in desperation and charged the Prince.

Not as it did in the Prime Material for the air was too heavy with fey energy. It winded and twisted. And somewhere in those moments, Khagor Sapchopper summoned the energy to look up at the twilight sky. The dancing lights were as far from the caverns of the Serpentspine he was born in as he could imagine. Never had he thought of such a place. But never had he had thought he would become more than a raider. Never had he thought he would lead a clan, his clan, to victory after victory.

 silentblade.1.d:0 "There was a time when Ruuk, strongest son of Troknar, was never far from his father’s side. This was expected; assuming Troknar would remain chief, Ruuk would succeed him after his death. He was meant to learn to rule by sharing in and questioning his father’s decisions and judgments. \n\nThose days were over. The longer clan Silentblade had been in the Deepwoods, the more Troknar had sought solitude, often spending hours alone in the woods before returning to give orders to his clan. Initially, Ruuk thought he had been grieving the death of his mother. But as the orders grew more erratic and the Troknar’s own behaviour grew stranger, Ruuk began to realize there was something more to it than that. Troknar had no intention of teaching him command, because he did not intend for him to ever take command.\n\nBecause Troknar did not intend to die.\n\nSomething had been set in motion, and Ruuk knew he was far too late to stop it, if he had ever been able to. Something had brought the Greentide into this accursed forest, and whatever it was, it was about to consume clan Silentblade. He had to fight it, but he couldn’t, not here, not alone. He would gather allies among the other clans, he had told himself. To challenge his father to Ozarm’Chadash before knowing what it was he faced was foolish, he had told himself. It was not enough to convince himself. He knew what he had done."
