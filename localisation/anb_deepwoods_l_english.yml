 I45_cluster_1_title:0 "Silent Lake Grove"
 I45_cluster_1_desc:0 "The Silent Lake of Clan Elyn has long been known as one of the most tranquil groves, at least along the shores. Elynáyle, the traditional capital has long been a place for elves to live out nostalgic memories of days in the remnant fleet. Its inhabitants have long spent their days sailing across the placid waters and fishing the bountiful waters to their hearts' content. Despite what one would expect of the Fae Forest, the open waters of the lake itself hold no significant threats to life or limb.\n\nThe southern shore is noted for a swampier character, with looming mangrove-like leviathans towering from the waters, creating a tangle of roots far more perilous than the open waters. The southernmost part of the grove, near Sáwelahain has long been a goblin stronghold, though the lake's shore has remained elven since the initial conquests."
 I45_cluster_2_title:0 "Mountain Grove"
 I45_cluster_2_desc:0 "The Mountain Grove of Clan Myna has long been appreciated as the one place where the land pierces the heavens, breaks free from the oppressive darkness of the forest's canopies. Their proud mountain home is carved from the caves in which the frightened elves, trapped within the forest first sheltered. Its caverns and slopes hold numerous hand-hewn dwellings that have been continuously inhabited for nearly the whole of the elves' tenure in the wood.\n\nThe Myna have long stood as a beacon of the Wood Elves' culture, above the rest in both valor and elevation. The woods of the grove are largely unremarkable, more peaceful than most thanks to their proximity to the forest's edge. Though it should be minded, "peaceful" may be quite a different measure in the Deepwoods."
 I45_cluster_3_title:0 "Thorn Grove"
 I45_cluster_3_desc:0 "The Thorngrove of Drennen lies at the center of the Deepwoods. It stands as perhaps the most overtly menacing part of the forest. While brambles and spines are nothing unusual in any part of the wood, even the trees take on a warped and thorny appearance this deep in the groves. While quite thoroughly cleansed of goblins and other rivals to the elves, the region was perhaps one of the most tightly held by the Fae. The spirits' sway has long been quite firm with pathways, and even whole villages seeming to phase in and out of the material plane on a whim."
 I45_cluster_4_title:0 "Bone Grove"
 I45_cluster_4_desc:0 "The Bone Grove has long been the home of Clan Cenág, one of the least numerous but tightest knit of the elves' clans. Though every wood elf quickly learns to navigate the tangle of roots and ferns that make up the Deepwood's paths, in the Bone Grove, they are forced to also learn to keep their balance when discarded femurs and tibias are added to that mix, and to mind the dens of bones and skulls at the center of many a clearing. Despite the danger of the bone-hoarders that inhabit these strange dwellings, this grove also has long held one of the greatest concentrations of goblins remaining in the forest."
 I45_cluster_5_title:0 "Flower Grove"
 I45_cluster_5_desc:0 "A name like the "Flower Grove" would surely put the mind at ease… Wouldn't it be one of the loveliest of the wood? With those softly glowing bulbs lending it light, with the vibrant colors of the ever-blooming flowers. The Scotha would call it lovely indeed. But who doesn't adore their home? Few others would, as the flowers were important enough to earn the grove's name only thanks to the great danger they pose.\n\nEvery inhabitant of the grove need make themselves a botanist, perhaps even an alchemist for the ease with which one could find danger in its beautiful flora. From friendly-looking fruits that can rot the gut, to pollens that set all manner of strange hazes over the mind, even a poorly judged step can find thorns filled with Cannor's most potent toxins ripping through the sole of a traveler's boot."
 I45_cluster_6_title:0 "Hunter's Grove"
 I45_cluster_6_desc:0 "The Hunter's Grove is home to the mightiest, most twisted beasts of the Deepwoods. Those who dare to try and tame it soon grow into warriors that rival even the forest's orcish invaders in their might. Providing they survive, of course. Home to Clan Fealgarn, the grove provides perhaps the most sporting hunts in all of Cannor. The giant malformed pets of the fae crash through the woods, splintering the ancient trees as they stalk their prey with venomous claws, with rows of teeth so numerous that one could hardly take count before they're taken into them. "
 I45_cluster_7_title:0 "Arrow Grove"
 I45_cluster_7_desc:0 "The Arrow Grove of the Ayeth's exact etymology is disputed. Is it for the fine wood employed in the crafting of arrows? Or is it the fact that arrows have long been the only reliable weapon, when a single misstep upon the treacherous ground could send one plunging to their demise? The limestone caverns beneath this part of the wood have eroded the forest floor into a maze of caverns, tunnels and gullies too treacherous for navigation.\n\nIt's far safer to traverse the canopy, bounding through the branches, swinging along vines, than to risk the treacherous maze below, where one misstep could send you down as long a fall as one from the canopy to firm ground. Even most of the Fae are reticent to trespass the treacherous earth of the grove, for the horrors that lurk beneath it promise some of the most torturous fates that the natural world offers outside the Effelai Jungle."
 I45_cluster_8_title:0 "River Grove"
 I45_cluster_8_desc:0 "Perhaps the most sincerely tranquil and pleasant of the groves, at least in days past, the River grove Ahain was, until the coming of the Greentide, a rare bastion of natural harmony in the Deepwoods. Elves, goblins, and some of the Woods' most prominent populations of satyr lived peacefully side by side. It is even rumored that a few remaining ancestors of the centaurs had been sighted living peacefully there, from time to time.\n\nThe region long held some of the least ireful of the Fey, resulting in the land's disposition to groves of bountiful fruits, and rivers teeming with an abundance of fish, around which most settlements were clustered. As the forest recovers from the orcish assault, one can only pray that this peace and abundance might return."
 I45_cluster_9_title:0 "Shadow Grove"
 I45_cluster_9_desc:0 "Ghul, the Shadow Grove. Home to the clan of that name, this remote corner of the forest had long been the black sheep of the Deepwoods. Shaded by the embrace of the Serpentspine's towering peaks on two sides, and an impenetrably thick canopy of black leaves above, the region was pitch black, with even the Jorkad river's headwaters wholly shaded in their flow, not a ray of light to be seen along its desperately rushing waters.\n\nThe grim elves of Ghul are rumored not only to appease the Unseelie, in their perversions and dark whimsy, but even to take travelers in appeasement of the viciously misanthropic Ashentree Fey, their dark practices a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."
 
 I45_securize_the_border_title:0 "Secure the Border"
 I45_securize_the_border_desc:0 "Following the emergence of the Greentide, many of the gladeways leading into the Deepwoods were abandoned. We must remedy this by establishing control over the outward paths. In doing so, we will ensure the safety and security of the Deepwoods from other potential outside invaders."
 I45_the_oak_guard_title:0 "The Oak Guard"
 I45_the_oak_guard_desc:0 "Having assumed control of the outer gladeways, we should re-institute the Oak Guard. This unit will maintain a constant vigilance upon the paths leading into the Deepwoods, thus ensuring that our lands will be adequately defended from any who would dare try to trespass into our wooded homeland."
 I45_cyranvar_renaissance_title:0 "Cyranvar Renaissance"
 I45_cyranvar_renaissance_desc:0 "The decision to improve the capital has proven providential. Even now, throngs of traders and other peoples from across Cannor have begun to engage with our realm en masse. We should ensure that this engagement will be beneficial for the state by adopting any of the customs or institutions that the outside world has innovated upon."
 I45_develop_infrastructure_title:0 "Develop Infrastructure"
 I45_develop_infrastructure_desc:0 "The destruction wrought by the Greentide has left the Deepwoods devastated. If we are to having any hope of creating a state capable of withstanding the threats that surround us, we must reverse this. Develop the realm so that our ancestors might be proud, and our enemies wary of thinking about thoughts of invasion!"
 I45_promote_education_title:0 "Promote Education"
 I45_promote_education_desc:0 "The ever-growing needs of the state require an almost inexhaustible amount of well educated bureaucrats. In order to ensure that our population is able to fill this demand, we will establish institutes of higher learning throughout Cyranvar."
 I45_only_the_best_title:0 "Only the Best"
 I45_only_the_best_desc:0 "Our decision to pursue a policy of enforced isolation is predicated on maintaining a highly elite standing army. While everyone is expected to undergo military training so that they might be called up in times of dire need, only the best among us are fit to serve in the standing army. This ensures that we have a serious military edge over our rivals, but this also means that filling our ranks to replace our fallen soldiers is difficult."
 I45_a_safe_country_title:0 "A Safe Country"
 I45_a_safe_country_desc:0 "As part of our ongoing policy of isolation, leading figures in our military establishment have called for the adoption of a strategy of preemptive engagement. They argue that striking beyond our borders to quell rising threats is superior to a policy of reactive defensiveness. The veracity of their argument has struck a chord with the High King. We must crush whatever threats emerge before they can harm our homeland!"
 I45_the_model_elf_title:0 "The Model Elf"
 I45_the_model_elf_desc:0 "In deciding to pursue isolation, our state has needed to thoroughly educated the populace about the benefits of this. Part of this education is rooted in a policy of mandatory service, known colloquially as the "Model Elf" program. Our citizens know that only by being wholly devoted to Cyranvar will the state prosper,and the security of the country be preserved. This ensures that we enjoy certain economic and military benefits that most states lack."
 
 I45_demand_the_oak_oath_title:0 "Demand the Oak Oath"
 I45_demand_the_oak_oath_desc:0 "The destruction of the orcish invaders has put us in the position of foremost prominence among the remaining Wood Elven states. We shall demand an oath of fealty from the remaining Kings in order to unite our people for the first time in history. Any who might foolishly decline this generous offer will be brought to heel by force."
 I45_a_capital_city_title:0 "A Capital City"
 I45_a_capital_city_desc:0 "As Cyranvar coalesces into a true state, our capital is sorely lacking compared to the other great cities of Cannor. If we are to truly assume a new found position of importance, we must renovate the capital to reflect the future orientation of our glorious state."
 I45_toward_the_future_title:0 "Toward the Future"
 I45_toward_the_future_desc:0 "The unification of the Deepwoods and the establishment of the Oak Monarchy affords our King the unique opportunity of deciding upon the direction of the Wood Elven people. Hardliners among us advocate for a policy of strict isolation to ensure that something like the Greentide will never happen again. Those with more liberal attitudes see the wonders that Cannor has to offer and argue for the adoption of a more open policy. Both directions will have serious consequences for the future of Cyranvar, choose wisely eminence!"
 I45_remember_the_fallen_title:0 "Remember the Fallen"
 I45_remember_the_fallen_desc:0 "As Cyranvar continues to develop, we mustn't ever forget our ancestors. Through their selfless sacrifice were our people saved. If not for them, then the Greentide would have destroyed us. As the kingdom develops we must commemorate their bravery through great works erected in their honour."
 I45_economic_boom_title:0 "Economic Boom"
 I45_economic_boom_desc:0 "Food on every table! Our economic policies have proven to be a resounding success. The economy has reached levels of prosperity we thought impossible, and the state will greatly benefit from this!"
 I45_silvar_ishu_title:0 "Silvar Ishu"
 I45_silvar_ishu_desc:0 "In choosing to isolate ourselves from Cannor, we have come to develop a relationship rooted in equilibrium with the Deepwoods. All of the actions of our Kingdom are rooted in respecting the limits and boundaries of our forested homeland. This has greatly deepened our ties with the feys and spirits of the land, who have taken to calling us the "Silvar Ishu" or Children of the Forest."
 I45_craft_the_meweri_scepter_title:0 "Craft the Meweri Scepter"
 I45_craft_the_meweri_scepter_desc:0 "The High King of the Deepwoods deserve an item of office truly befitting the position. To this end, we have summoned the greatest craftsmen from across the realm to requisition an enchanted sceptre to symbolize the office of the High King of the Oak Monarchy." 
 I45_under_the_canopy_title:0 "Under the Canopy"
 I45_under_the_canopy_desc:0 "Beneath the shadowed canopy of the Deepwoods, our people thrive! Centuries have passed since the devastation of the Greentide, yet thanks to our beneficent rule, Cyranvar is now the envy of Cannor. Our economy is burgeoning, trade continues to blossom and none would dare to challenge our military might! Never again shall the Wood Elves suffer under the yoke of foreign invaders, for we have assumed our rightful position among the peoples of the world!"
 
 I45_toward_unification_title:0 "Toward Unification"
 I45_toward_unification_desc:0 "While Cyranvar is by far the most dominant realm in the Deepwoods, we have yet to exert full control over our homeland. We must remedy this by bringing any who might resist our designs into submission. Only through unification might we hope to achieve our rightful place in Cannor."
 I45_a_united_deepwoods_title:0 "United Deepwoods"
 I45_a_united_deepwoods_desc:0 "Through countless wars and great struggle, we have managed to unite the entirety of the Deepwoods under our rule. Plans have begun to emerge to elevate the status of our newly unified realm, time will tell what direction our state shall pursue."
 I45_a_high_king_title:0 "A High King"
 I45_a_high_king_desc:0 "Successfully uniting the entire of our wooded homeland has allowed our monarch to truly assume a position of importance. The Oak Monarchy has been established, heralding in a new chapter for our people under the illustrious rule of the High King of the Wood Elves."
 I45_the_keys_to_rule_title:0 "The Keys to Rule"
 I45_the_keys_to_rule_desc:0 "With the progression of time, and the evolution of political and cultural attitudes, our state now finds itself at a crossroads. Serious division has arisen among the people over the nature of the Oak Monarchy. Some advocate for the High King to assume a position of absolute authority, ensuring that the state remains strong. Other suggests that a parliament or some other delegative body be established, lessening the power of the King and handing over authority to elected officials. They argue that this would ensure the monarch remains legitimate, and will allow for the development of a more dynamic state. Regardless of the direction the King chooses, a decision must be made now."
 I45_develop_artisanat_title:0 "Develop Artisanat"
 I45_develop_artisanat_desc:0 "In choosing to pursue a policy of openness, we must ensure that our economy doesn't become dominated by our neighbours. To avert this potential economic slavery, the kingdom will intervene wherever necessary to ensure the development of a strong, thriving Cyranvar no matter the cost."
 I45_centralize_money_printing_title:0 "Centralize Money Printing"
 I45_centralize_money_printing_desc:0 "Our policy of supporting the Artisanat has been a resounding success. Yet despite this, private money suppliers exert an undue influence upon our economy which is a growing concern. We must exert our control by becoming the sole supplier of currency. This will ensure that money continues to flow, though we may run into some challenges..."
 I45_one_of_many_title:0 "One of Many"
 I45_one_of_many_desc:0 "In pursuing a policy of openness, our people have come to value trade and production above all else. As a result, the influence exerted by the mercantile classes has led to a qualitative change upon our culture, this is most evident in military affairs. In times of war, all are expected to serve and to do their duty, yet no room is afforded for bravado or individual greatness. Every soldier is but one of many."
 I45_expert_artisan_title:0 "Expert Artisans"
 I45_expert_artisan_desc:0 "The skill of our artisans is incomparable. Nowhere across Cannor can one find individuals of comparable quality. The Artisans have proven to be a resounding success, as the future generations are able to continue to improve upon the skills inherited from their masters."
 I45_the_cosmopolitan_elf_title:0 "The Cosmopolitan Elf"
 I45_the_cosmopolitan_elf_desc:0 "Our ancestors traditions proved incapable of adapting to the rapidly changing world around us. In seeking to open our borders and engage with the continent at large, our economy has thrived and a more egalitarian society has developed. No longer shall any individual feel beholden to time honoured traditions. Instead we are a truly cosmopolitan people, willing and able to adopt the best practices of all cultures."
 
 I45_internal_trade_title:0 "Internal Trade"
 I45_internal_trade_desc:0 "The opening of the Deepwoods has seriously hindered our ability to profit from the fruits of our labour. If we are to have any hope of seeing trade thrive in our land, we must limit the ability of foreign merchants to exploit our resources. We must adopt whatever means necessary to advantage our merchants and limit the ability of predatory foreign merchants to exploit us."
 I45_a_protectionism_approach_title:0 "A Protectionist Approach"
 I45_a_protectionism_approach_desc:0 "Our measures to protect internal trade have proven to be inadequate. Even with serious barriers to trade, foreigners continue to exploit our poor economic position. Harsher barriers must be erected lest we become slaves to foreign economic interests. We're going to make the Deepwoods great again!"

Our King sees the opportunity presented by this, and has called for the Verdant Pact to be unified into a true state for the Wood Elven people. Naturally our vassals will be absorbed in the process and we will be able to press our claim upon whatever portions of out homeland remain out of our reach.

 WOOD_reclaim_the_emerald_path_desc:0 "If our people are to have any hope of pushing these invaders from the Deepwoods, we must ensure that the entirety of the Verdant Link lies within Wood Elven Hands. The vile Greenskins are using them to continue launching their incessant raids into the heart of our lands. We must seize them to end these raids and put them on the backfoot!"

 WOOD_own_the_emerald_path_desc:0 "Even with the entirety of the Verdant Link lying within the Pact's hands, the raids continue when conflict flares up. Our allies' laxity in protecting the Links requires a change of policy. We must personally assume control of the Verdant Link, only then will the safety and security of our realm be ensured. This will have the added benefit of affording us a serious advantage over our compatriots once the Greenskins have been driven from our lands."

 WOOD_the_verdant_pact_desc:0 "The sudden onslaught of the Greenskins has caught our people completely unawares. In order to mount a proper defense of our lands, the various chiefs and petty kings formed the Verdant Pact to coordinate the war effort. We must deepen our ties with the various Wood Elven realms in an effort to forge a stronger united front, so that we might begin to mount an offensive against the vile orcs."

 WOOD_settle_the_refugees_desc:0 "When the Greentide first began, many of our people's realms were caught completely off-guard. Before they could even mount an effective resistance they were snuffed out. No matter what the old guard in the realm might grumble about now, we are Wood Elves first and foremost. Clan loyalties and old strife have no place in the face of this menace. To this effect, those few souls who survived the devastation wrought must be resettled so that we might benefit from their expertise in the trying times ahead."

 WOOD_the_verdant_army_desc:0 "The purpose of the Verdant Pact was to present a united front against the barbarous orcs. To this end, a common army of the Wood Elven realms was formed.

She offers her pristine hand, lips curling into a smile, teeth bared. Her robe of leaves and ivy begins to slip. There is a choice to be made, here and now, one that will determine the future of [Root.GetName]. But is it a choice at all?"
