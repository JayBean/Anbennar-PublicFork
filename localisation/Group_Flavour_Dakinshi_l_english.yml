 dakinshi.1.t:0 "Kwizera Advances East"
 dakinshi.1.d:0 "The great and mighty Kwizera, breaker of walls and slayer of the Death Bringing Cobras, has completed bringing western Dakinshiland under her wise and able rule. It is time to march against the weakling Mwasagore and bring her lands to heel. The pitiful heiress of Gulimbazi and her vaunted Destroyers will be broken before Kwizera's might, rendered helpless before the one truly meant to end the Warlord Era. \n\nShe and all those loyal to her will be hung from their wrists before the people, their skin flayed and salted as they cry out for mercy that will not come; made to beg and swear loyalty to Kwizera before death is allowed. To restore order to the lands, all must be shown the consequences of resisting our Namingo's just rule.\n\nHail Kwizera!\n\nHail the truest Warrior-Daughter of Brave Mongoose!"
 dakinshi.1.a:0 "Now is the time of decision"
 dakinshi.1.b:0 "The army needs more time to prepare"
 dakinshi.2.t:0 "Kwizera's Invasion"
 dakinshi.2.d:0 "Daughter of my friend, the warlord Kwizera's armies have begun a large-scale invasion of Mwasagore's lands, burning a path of blood and ruin westwards. While it might be prudent to let them simply fight, Kwizera's power and cruelty are both well known. It seems inevitable that if the situation is allowed to develop as it is, Mwasagore will be defeated and Kwizera will extend her cruel rule over the lands once under Mwasagore's protection. A true hero cannot allow people to suffer, even if doing so will surely aid a rival. Furthermore, it is most unlikely that you are capable of defeating Kwizera's magic and armies on your own. You will need an ally either in the form of Mwasagore or the Antmvura. I leave the decision to you young Akaliza. It is a heavy burden a Namingo must bear."
 dakinshi.2.a:0 "Such a tyrant must be stopped now. Send word to Mwasagore, we will come to her aid for this fight."
 dakinshi.2.b:0 "Should we fail, those under my protection will suffer Kwizera's depredations as well. It is wiser to seek an alliance with the Antmvura and prepare for the coming battle."
 dakinshi.3.t:0 "The Leadership of the Death Bringing Cobra Clan"
 dakinshi.3.d:0 "Since the death of Garuka at the hands of the traitorous Kwizera, the Death Bringing Cobra clan has been leaderless, stripped even of Garuka's close family in Kwizera's single night of murderous betrayal, our fellow clan members strung up to die slowly in front of her new subjects. The assembled vassal chiefs and minor members of the lineage have been unable to come to any sort of agreement, but the surprise arrival of Garuka's head wife Kuende has forced the issue. She carries with her a child that she says belongs to her deceased beloved and urges the clan to accept her leadership so that she can take revenge for the injustices the traitor has dealt to our siblings. However there are voices of dissent in the clan: Those who whisper that Kuende was among those who died that day; that she practices witchcraft; that children have begun vanishing in the night since she arrived; that the woman who has come is false or worse: Come to bring further darkness upon our clan. Can we trust her? Do we have a choice?"
 dakinshi.3.a:0 "A shaman of the minor lineages will lead the clan. Kuende should take care of the child. Under close watch."
 dakinshi.3.b:0 "Kuende shall lead the clan in vengeance."
 dakinshi.4.t:0 "The Fate of Mwasagore"
 dakinshi.4.d:0 "Mwasagore, incapable heiress to Gulimbazi lies defeated at your feet. Bereft of allies and forced to confront her own inadequacy compared to the legacy she bears. It is clear she has given up hope, and waits only to know whether she live or die."
 dakinshi.4.a:0 "She must die. None can be allowed to use her to foment rebellion."
 dakinshi.4.b:0 "This Warlord Era should be ended in peace, not bloodshed. Let us form bonds of kinship instead of bonds of vengeance. Her spouses will be my spouses, her children will be my children."
 dakinshi.4.c:0 "She will serve me: A broken and bloodied bauble to show my uncontestable authority. But first, bring forth some of her children. She will kill her own to prove loyalty to me."
 dakinshi.5.t:0 "The Fate of Kwizera"
 dakinshi.5.d:0 "Kwizera, tyrant Namingo and terror of the Death Bringing Cobras stands before you defeated in fact if not in spirit. Her eyes know only hate for you, and while it would be most prudent to kill her, you can’t help but wonder what such an effective warrior might accomplish in your service."
 dakinshi.5.c:0 "By the sacred laws I cannot harm my wife. And her rage at the reversal of our positions is such a delight."
 dakinshi.6.t:0 "The Fate of Akaliza"
 dakinshi.6.d:0 "Akaliza enters the throne room of her former capital, somehow standing tall and proud even in her shackles, the guards struggling to keep back the throng of common people who have come to see the fate of their hero. The immortal frog Rufaro watches from the hands of a shaman standing in the crowd like a sandbar in the river, helpless to act to save the descendant of his old friend Hazvinei. The room awaits your words."
 dakinshi.6.c:0 "The frog raised her right? Bring a chef. I'm sure she'll enjoy the meal."
 dakinshi.7.t:0 "The Fate of The Death Bringing Cobras"
 dakinshi.7.d:0 "The Death Bringing Cobra clan is no more, its numbers savaged by both Kwizera's slaughter and their recent defeat at your hands. Barely more than a dozen minor members of the clan still exist, now absorbed into your household. Of interest is a baby among them, whom interrogation has revealed is claimed to be the daughter of the late Garuka, brought to them by his wife Kuende, who had apparently attacked the clan with witchcraft after being denied leadership. It might be best to simply add the child to the rest of the war orphans, to be adopted into a life of mundane obscurity. But given the historical position of the Death Bringing Cobra lineage, there is something to be said about claiming her as your own daughter."
 dakinshi.7.a:0 "She is my babe now, to protect and to care for. All shall know her as my daughter and my children and spouses shall accept her as any other of my children. Perhaps one day, another of the blood of Mauya will rule Dakinshiland."
 dakinshi.7.b:0 "Kill the child. She cannot be allowed to exist."
 dakinshi.8.t:0 "The Fate of Umutukomye"
 dakinshi.8.d:0 "Umutukomye, a bandit risen far above what most would expect of her, is a curious creature. Knowing she was defeated, she offered her surrender in person, and has been fully accommodating in pointing out where she hid all of her wealth. Perhaps she thinks her silver tongue will convince you of sparing her.. Perhaps her violent life has simply prepared her for such a fate. More relevant a question is what you will do with her."
 dakinshi.8.c:0 "By the sacred laws, I cannot harm my own wife, even if she sought to do harm to me. But I can certainly arrange miserable accommodations."
 dakinshi.9.t:0 "The Fate of Gahigi"
 dakinshi.9.d:0 "Gahigi stands before you in chains, his loyal okapi Shongwe similarly bound next to him in deference to their bond. The man stood against you, but it's difficult to deny his resourcefulness if nothing else."
 dakinshi.9.a:0 "Kill him and his little okapi too."
 dakinshi.9.b:0 "This Warlord Era should be ended in peace, not bloodshed. Let us form bonds of kinship instead of bonds of vengeance. His spouses will be my spouses, his children will be my children."
 dakinshi.9.c:0 "A servant with a hostage already taken? How convenient."
 dakinshi.10.t:0 "Akaliza Joins With Mwasagore."
 dakinshi.10.d:0 "My Namingo. Word has come that the weakling Akaliza has pledged her armies to the aid of your enemy Mwasagore. Though we are now greatly outnumbered, Akaliza's forces will take time to reach the conflict. \n\n If they fear you this much, then show them they are justified and break the armies of Mwasagore before her ally can arrive. This craven alliance only serves to prove your might over that of your rivals."
 dakinshi.10.a:0 "I will crush her beneath my heel as well."

 dakinshi.11.t:0 "A New Leader Arises Within Death Bringing Cobra"
 dakinshi.11.d:0 "After Kwizera slaughtered most of the members of the Death Bringing Cobras, the clan was left in a leadership crisis, like a snake with its head cut off. It seems now, their leadership crisis has been resolved, with [S30.Monarch.GetName] becoming the new head of what remains of the clan. It is unclear who [S30.Monarch.GetName] is, and what their intentions are. Still, it remains prudent of us to keep a watchful eye upon that venerable clan and its internal affairs, even if they remain a minor player in Dakinshi affairs for now."
 dakinshi.11.a:0 "And here I thought they were destroyed..."

 dakinshi.12.t:0 "A New Leader Arises Within Death Bringing Cobra"
 dakinshi.12.d:0 "After Kwizera slaughtered most of the members of the Death Bringing Cobras, the clan was left in a leadership crisis, like a snake with its head cut off. It seems now, their leadership crisis has been resolved, with [S30.Monarch.GetName] becoming the new head of what remains of the clan. Dark rumors surround this individual, with many speculating she practices the dark arts of necromancy, with her true loyalties lying with the hags of the Yezel Mora."
 dakinshi.12.a:0 "It seems the hags have intervened once more..."
