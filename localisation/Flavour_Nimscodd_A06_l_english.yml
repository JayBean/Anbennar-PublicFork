 hierarchy_secure_the_tributaries_desc:0 "Although holding the river Ynn itself is a great feat, it will leave our defences wide open to attacks from east and west.

Despite facing tall odds, the brave Cliff Gnomes of Nimscodd have gone to war against the kobolds of the Dragon Coast, and they now call upon their gnomish brethren abroad for aid.
