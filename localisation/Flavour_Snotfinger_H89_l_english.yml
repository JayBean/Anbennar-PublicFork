 H89_first_kill_title:0 "First Kill"
 H89_first_kill_desc:0 "There is not a single goblin alive in the Dwarovar who is unaware of the acts of the orcs towards our people. From slavery to brutal cullings to being used as cannon fodder in their armies - for too long have our people suffered under the orcs. But now, as our clan grows stronger, it is their turn to know the feel of dread at every footstep heard in the dark."
 H89_deep_knowledge_title:0 "Deep Knowledge"
 H89_deep_knowledge_desc:0 "Within the depths of the Serpentspine, where many may see nothing but the oppressive darkness, we deign to see something more. Lying amongst the ruins of the ancient Aul-Dwarov, in the cave dwellings of our forefathers, and within other more sinister locations - old knowledge is hidden everywhere and all we have to do is look for it."
 H89_settling_down_title:0 "Settling Down"
 H89_settling_down_desc:0 "To escape our orcish oppressors and keep our tribe alive amongst the wars of the orcs - both within and without the Serpentspine - we've never been able to rest long in one spot. Now, when our future seems brighter than ever, settling down may be for the best. Luckily there's a perfectly abandoned dwarven hold just by the corner where we could build up our nation."
 H89_makeshift_wisdom_title:0 "Makeshift Wisdom"
 H89_makeshift_wisdom_desc:0 "As we delve deeper and deeper into the caves and abandoned structures of the Serpentspine, we're unearthing more and more information that will be of immense help in developing our society. Though we may not understand everything we find, with a bit of goblin ingenuity, everything will be of use."
 H89_hunting_orcs_title:0 "Hunting Orcs"
 H89_hunting_orcs_desc:0 "With the first step of our revenge complete, the Dwarovar is now one clan closer to being free from the orcish menace. Now, despite there being no large clans close to us for us to focus our spite, we will continue enacting our vengeance on the various smaller scattered tribes around our lands."
 H89_light_at_the_end_title:0 "The Light at the End"
 H89_light_at_the_end_desc:0 "For as long as we can remember, us goblins have lived in the depths and darkness of the Serpentspine; and to us this was all there was. However, orcs took the war to Escann, taking multitudes of our brethren as their servants to fight for them - but there we discovered the outside world, and all its possibilities. Now as we establish our nation, we must consider the outer world... and how we may one day have to fight the orcs out there."
 H89_putting_our_house_title:0 "Putting Our House in Order"
 H89_putting_our_house_desc:0 "Having settled the ancient dwarven hold of Haraz Orldhûm as our capital, we've taken the first steps in a long journey towards becoming a proper nation. However, much of the Serpetnspine still lays in disrepair due to the long millenia of war and, as such, our lands still need some work to fulfill their potential; as well as our hold that has only a fraction of the glory it once had and could one day have once more."
 H89_first_dose_title:0 "First Dose"
 H89_first_dose_desc:0 "The usage of drugs is nothing new to goblinkind. From the various hallucinogens consumed in our shaman's rituals to goblins just eating/licking/snorting random things around the caves to varied effects, intoxication is almost a staple of goblin culture. After combining the ancient wisdom of our shamans, the knowledge we've unearthed from our explorations of the Serpentspine, patented goblin ingenuity, and whatever plants, animals and monstrosities we were able to gather from Snotslair, we were able to produce the first samples of experimental military narcotics, which are sure to bring our army to the next level."
 H89_digging_for_knowledge_title:0 "Digging for Knowledge"
 H89_digging_for_knowledge_desc:0 "The ancient dwarven halls we've started calling our home holds a trove of knowledge waiting to be found - and as we discover the world outside the serpentspine and develop the techniques and expertise needed to explore the lower floors, we have more means and motives to deepen our capital than ever."
 H89_speed_dig_title:0 "Speed Dig"
 H89_speed_dig_desc:0 "As we settle more and more holds, many of which in dire need of repair, we've come to realize that some of the chemical substances consumed by our workers actually give them a drive to work and dig beyond what is normal (and perhaps healthy). We should most definitely look into harnessing and perfecting these drugs to help our digging."
 H89_talk_smack_title:0 "Talk Smack..."
 H89_talk_smack_desc:0 "Having started out as a tool for survival, as we've settled and started developing our society, insulting has developed into a staple of Clan Snotfinger. From a mere way of taunting orcs to bait them out into our ambushes, insulting has developed into a societal custom for our people: with casual disrespect, slander, and taunts being as much a source of bonding as entertainment. Now if only other nations saw it the same way..."
 H89_a_proper_route_title:0 "Proper Route to Escann"
 H89_a_proper_route_desc:0 "Who could have guessed that an entire world existed outside of the caves where we've lived all our lives?\nWell probably a lot of people, but for us, this was the discovery of the century, and it opens a whole lot of opportunities for trade and diplomacy with whoever is out there. However, dealing with the surface dwellers by going through caves isn't very convenient, and certainly doesn't give them the best impression, so it'd be good to have a proper gateway to reach the outside. Thankfully, the dwarven hold of Khugdihr seems like the perfect place for us to set up our endeavors."
 H89_preparing_for_payback_title:0 "Preparing for Payback"
 H89_preparing_for_payback_desc:0 "When the greentide began, us goblins who weren't forced to leave our caves with the orc oppressors weren't sure where all the orcs went. Now that we know of Escann, we can see that these lands are filled with orcish filth. It's up to us to prepare to deal with their existence."
 H89_platinum_drip_title:0 "Platinum Drip"
 H89_platinum_drip_desc:0 "While expanding our capital of Haraz Orldhûm, we discovered that the platinum hold was, in fact, loaded with platinum jewelry and trinkets. While keeping the shinies to ourselves is certainly a promising proposition, we are attempting to carve our way out of being considered monsters and to develop friendly relations with the nations outside - offering these as a form of trade would certainly give us a fair headstart. Plus, the money we may gain from it is certainly not bad either."
 H89_reverting_the_greentide_title:0 "Reverting the Greentide"
 H89_reverting_the_greentide_desc:0 "We've started our campaign against the orcs in Escann, but just defeating them in a war will never be enough. Whatever we do, it must be definitive and terminal. None will remain from our wrath."
 H89_get_friends_title:0 "...Get Friends?"
 H89_get_friends_desc:0 "Well, it seems like our insults paid off. While not everyone seems to appreciate being insulted to their faces, they most certainly appreciate us insulting their enemies; and as such we're on track to have functional foreign affairs."
 H89_farming_and_administrating_title:0 "Farming and Administrating"
 H89_farming_and_administrating_desc:0 "Expanding our lands into the former dwarven capital of Amldihr, we discovered a trove of knowledge of various degrees of Utility. The Dwarven Empire's notes on administering vast tracts of land and how to maximize the utility of the holds and railways are certainly interesting, but knowing the best overland farming techniques aren't really our style. However, we do know a few people outside the Serpentspine who may pay top ducats for such information."
 H89_weapons_stash_title:0 "Weapons Stash"
 H89_weapons_stash_desc:0 "Having conquered the hold of Mithradhûm, we've discovered that the arms factory of the dwarves really lives up to its name. While patching up the hold and getting it up to depth, we found hoards of not just weapons but also the instructions to create them - which will serve both us and our friends in Escann very well."
 H89_united_in_anger_title:0 "United in Anger"
 H89_united_in_anger_desc:0 "With the old dwarven capital of Amldihr under our control, we will begin the long process of ridding it of its previous orcish inhabitants. Having conquered this historical location - filled to the brim with dwarven artifacts and significance - does give us an interesting, if unexpected, opportunity.\n\nFor as long as we remember, we've been in conflict with dwarves, fighting for space under the mountains. But when the orcish threat appeared, though we didn't set our difference aside, both of our races began fighting this new threat. As we try to become a respectable country in the eyes of the wider world, we may use our joint hatred and our dwarven relics as a tool to, if not clear our past woes, at least begin a long road to respect."
 H89_more_than_you_can_hold_title:0 "More than you can Hold"
 H89_more_than_you_can_hold_desc:0 "As we expand through the caves, we find the ever increasing need to control more holds to use as administrative centers. Focusing on conquering, and fixing, these holds should be our top priority!"
 H89_getting_higher_title:0 "Getting High(er)"
 H89_getting_higher_desc:0 "Picking up from our last endeavor into military grade narcotics, we've started development on more potent substances to enhance our troops with. It seems like the increased effectiveness does have a few harmful drawbacks, such as the massive hangovers our troops are facing after most engagements... but while they're high they are by far the fastest and most fearless (and most reckless) warriors we've seen."
 H89_low_blows_title:0 "Low Blows"
 H89_low_blows_desc:0 "Our insults have been a pretty useful diplomatic tool thus far, helping us find friends through common hatred. But if we're to have a future in diplomacy, we must not only refine our insults beyond all we've done so far - but we must also prove our insults are not just show, and we can also back our talk."
 H89_a_proper_lab_title:0 "A Proper Lab"
 H89_a_proper_lab_desc:0 "Our drugs have been a real hit so far, but we have to admit the whole process has been somewhat... amateur. Now, we appreciate good old cave moonshine and mushrooms as much as any other goblins, but if we're to synthesize more sophisticated chemicals we'll need a facility properly designed to do that; as well as the proper tools for the job. What better place for this new lab, then, than the place it all started: Snotslair."
 H89_mushroom_for_growth_title:0 "Mush-room for Growth"
 H89_mushroom_for_growth_desc:0 "Among the many fungi that grow in the caves we live in, a few seem to exhibit very promising traits for our drug making endeavors. Hallucinogenic shrooms, for instance, have been used by goblin shamans for generations, as a way to commune with the higher spirits (and occasionally to have fun). With our current know-how, we could very well start farming these mushrooms and develop the techniques to refine their narcotic properties."
 H89_help_from_outside_title:0 "Help from Outside"
 H89_help_from_outside_desc:0 "Expanding into the former orcish lands in Escann, we're finding more and more in common with the humans that inhabit the region - primarily our mutual hatred for orc-kind. There's a lot we could learn from them, so if we develop our relations, maybe they could lend their expertise to improve our armies (and to help kill more orcs)."
 H89_like_a_dragon_title:0 "Like a Dragon"
 H89_like_a_dragon_desc:0 "Us goblins have a lot in common with kobolds. Both of our races are normal sized (as opposed to most abnormally tall races), like tinkering around, and have a fascination with bright things (though in their case it's gold, while we really like explosions). They probably also hate orcs, which is a plus in our books. It is only natural then, that we offer our fellows sanctuary in our growing kingdom; though we might also be able to get something out of this relation."
 H89_escann_dealers_title:0 "Escann's Dealers"
 H89_escann_dealers_desc:0 "We've been producing drugs mostly as a domestic product so far, but the few samples that do leave our lands have proved to be very successful - and very profitable - in other nations. Why not, then, increase the scale of our operation and use our trade connections to Escann to start exporting drugs? There is certainly a lot of money to be made."
 H89_good_intentions_title:0 "Good Intentions"
 H89_good_intentions_desc:0 "Some people would argue that having most of our diplomatic policy be calling our rivals (and neutral parties, occasionally our allies and often all of the former's mothers) names wouldn't be very conductive towards having any friends. However, our insult based diplomacy has been surprisingly effective in creating allies for ourselves (not to mention making our enemies seethe in anger). However, we mustn't rest on our laurels: keeping our allies happy and showing our enemies we can back our threats up is essential to keep our diplomacy functional."
 H89_well_protected_title:0 "Well Protected"
 H89_well_protected_desc:0 "Digging even deeper into our capital of Haraz Orldhûm, we've found another part of the legacy of the Platinum hold: armor. More specifically, we've found a large vault, filled with suits of very advanced armor. Unfortunately for us, this armor does not fit really well into our current military tactics, being too clunky and slow for our preferred "snort and hit and run" tactics. However, our friends in Escann may have different opinions on how much this armor is worth for them..."
 H89_goblean_title:0 "GobLean"
 H89_goblean_desc:0 "The recent unrest in our nation, and the discovery of a slime with interesting numbing properties, has led our government to inquire on new ways to apply our drug making capabilities to control the wider population. The resulting purple drink will certainly be a certified cave classic."
 H89_reuse_and_recycle_title:0 "Reuse and Recycle"
 H89_reuse_and_recycle_desc:0 "The hold of Mithradhûm, in the far gone past of its dwarven rule, used to be home to the Goblinslayer Academy. This icon of the unending conflict between goblins and dwarves is now a monument to a grudge we have no intention of perpetuating - not to mention our lack of interest in training our army to specialize in killing our fellow goblins. However, we do realize that such a specialized training facility could very well be the basis for our very own orc slaying training camp."
 H89_not_too_cool_title:0 "Not Too Cool for School"
 H89_not_too_cool_desc:0 "Snotslair's role as a major drug lab has been resoundingly successful. However, we now face another issue: rather than base ingredients or proper infrastructure, our biggest bottleneck in increasing the complexity and scale of our drugs production is the lack of qualified experts. While we made due with random people who weren't (too) hooked on our stuff to help with the production, it seems we'll need a proper place to train new employees and researchers."
 H89_grim_ultimatum_title:0 "Grim Ultimatum"
 H89_grim_ultimatum_desc:0 "Trading with Escann has been a very successful endeavor; for Escann and us both. However, despite the horrors of the Greentide, many Escanni nations seem to be forgetting their past and are now letting orcs live to use them as labor or, even worse, actually tolerating or intermingling with the orcish menace. We cannot accept this, even from our staunchest allies. Thankfully, our influence in the region may just be used to remind our fellows of who they should be fighting against..."
 H89_crystal_blue_title:0 "Crystal Blue Persuasion"
 H89_crystal_blue_desc:0 "While creating damestear from a purely synthetic source is impossible (or at least, seems to be from our experiments), we believe we are able to create substances that allow for mages to fight for longer (If at the cost of their own life force)."
 H89_adding_injury_to_insult_title:0 "Adding Injury to Insult"
 H89_adding_injury_to_insult_desc:0 "Many people praise poets and bards for bringing tears to their eyes with nothing but words. Here in Snotfinger, citizens of any age can not only make you cry but also want to jump from a tower with no more than a few well placed comments on your appearance, your mother's sexual life, or your lack thereof. In fact, our insults are so powerful we can greatly impact foreign nations, as a mild burn from one of our diplomats can cause a ruler to be shunned by his peers and his nation to rebel."
 H89_adding_injury_to_insult_tt:0 "Is at war with §YSnotfinger§!\n   Has been insulted by §YSnotfinger§!\n   §YSnotfinger§! war score against is at least §Y75§!"
 H89_global_crusade_title:0 "Global Crusade"
 H89_global_crusade_desc:0 "While we're close to clearing our lands and our immediate surroundings of the orc threat, we know there are many more orcs in the wider world - hidden in the caves of the Serpentspine and in the fields and forests of wider Escann. After we're done clearing our house, we're coming for them. No orcs shall remain in our watch."
 H89_getting_much_higher_title:0 "Getting Much Higher"
 H89_getting_much_higher_desc:0 "Our army is now basically doing drugs all the time, and we probably lose more soldiers to overdosing than to the enemy, but damn are they effective! Fast, fearless, and only somewhat uncontrollable, our force is if nothing else a frightening thing to battle.\n\nCan we get much higher? Probably not without major casualties, but we'll keep on trying."
 
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_stimulant:0 "Digamphetamine"
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_stimulant_desc:0 "Digamphetamine, going by the street name of Dig, is an off-white crystal that causes increased energy, increased focus, and inexplicably gives the user a desire to dig - as well as several harmful side effects. It is used primarily to assist in deepening our holds and in repairing operations."
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_hallucinogen:0 "Psilocygoblin"
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_hallucinogen_desc:0 "An oil distilled from the various hallucinogenic mushrooms that grow in the Dwarovar, Psilocygoblin is a powerful psychedelic. It is used by various goblin shamans in ceremonies as a more effective replacement for mushroom tea; as well as used recreationally, of course."
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_drakodil:0 "Drakodil"
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_drakodil_desc:0 "Developed with help from the kobolds of Serpentspine, Drakodil is a reddish liquid that, when injected, grants the user the ability to breathe fire for a few hours. While not as powerful as a dragon's fire breath, this effect is strong enough to allow for military usages. One side effect of usage of this drug is the appearance of fragile scales in the user's skin, which makes them very vulnerable to various forms of harm."
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_calmant:0 "Goblean"
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_calmant_desc:0 "A popular recreational drug used by goblin youths, Goblean is made by combining a hot drink with a particular type of slime found in the Dwarovar. This slime, which employs a powerful numbing agent as part of it's hunting strategy, when sufficiently diluted in the drink provokes feelings of euphoria, calm, and relaxation upon those who consume it "
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_synthetic:0 "Synthetic Damestear"
 artifice_invention_snotfinger_synthetic_desc:0 "Used as a supplement for mages, Synthetic Damestear is a blue crystal that when consumed allows for mages to cast spells for longer. Despite its name, Synthetic Damestear is not an artificially created version of real damestear, and it does not actually restore mana to the user, instead just giving the sensation of a refilled mana supply. This allows for mages to keep casting spells while draining their own life force and stamina, leading to many accidental deaths due to excessive magic usage."
 
 snotfinger_events.1.t:0 "Old Tech"
 snotfinger_events.1.d:0 "Exploring the caves and forgotten buildings of the Serpentspine has given us insight into all the knowledge that is hidden within these mountains. We've also found evidence of other such places where more knowledge may be hidden close to our location, which gives us many more opportunities to explore and learn."
 snotfinger_events.1.a:0 "So much knowledge hidden away..."
 snotfinger_events.2.t:0 "Jewelry for Sale"
 snotfinger_events.2.d:0 "A major, and somewhat unsurprising, discovery was made when expanding Haraz Orldhûm: The platinum hold is, in fact, filled with platinum! More specifically, lots of jewelry and trinkets, which seem to be very pretty, but most importantly, valuable. While keeping the shinies to ourselves is certainly a promising proposition, our recent diplomatic attempts with nations outside the mountains could greatly benefit from us using these as a bargaining chip, to show we're capable of commerce. Plus, the money we may gain from it is certainly not bad either."

 snotfinger_events.4.d:0 "After a long fought battle, we've finally managed to get these orcs we've been fighting against beneath our boots. But simple domination isn't enough: we wan't these orcs to end. As we can't personally guarantee the death of the orcs we've conquered in the long run, nor can we actually take all of this land for ourselves yet, we will guarantee their demise in the short term.\n\nBurn the lands, and the occupants, we'll occupy them when it suits us."

 snotfinger_events.5.t:0 "Scrolls for Sale"
 snotfinger_events.5.d:0 "While deepening and restoring Amldihr, we discovered a trove of material regarding the administration of the Aul-Dwarov. While much of it was used as fuel for campfires for the workers, some of it was useful enough to be retained, such as tips on how hold architecture can be best optimized and other technical nonsense like that. However, some of the notes, while not immediately useful for us, could potentially be of use for our trade contacts outside of the mountains. "

 snotfinger_events.9.d:0 "Despite our differences and our long history of conflict, we find that dwarves hate orcs (almost) as much as we do. While putting our differences aside and fighting against the common enemy may be hard, there is a lot we may learn from our old foes.\n\nOne option we have is letting the dwarves in our nation resettle their old capital, and either have them help in our other holds or integrate the dwarves as part of our military.\n\nAlternatively, if we don't feel charitable enough to tolerate dwarves within our lands, we could oust them to other dwarven nations, letting them take their various dwarven heirlooms we have no use for. This would show our commitment to, if not fully mending the relations between our races, then at least fighting together against the greater foe."
