 ######Events######
 ######Part 1######
 flavor_seghdihr.1.t:0 "A Dark Day"
 flavor_seghdihr.1.d:0 "It started, as it always does, in the dark.\nThe skittering of claws against stone. The low chortles and clicks of their goblin-speak echoing in the cavernous depths. But reports from Gor Ozumbrog have poured in, with their patrols identifying the noises coming from further down the Dwarovrod, towards the passage which dives deep into the underground bypassing the poor quality stone and earth towards the surface before emerging once again in the Tree of Stone. At first, we assumed it was a small warband of goblins, nothing local patrols couldn't handle.\nThen the local patrols went silent.\nGroups from Gor Ozumbrog were dispatched, and the true depths of the horror were made clear. Goblins, thousands of them, pouring from the Tree of Stone! Like a living wall of filth and refuse, armed with whatever they could gather, from end to end of the Dwarovrod, moving like a wave forward, towards us. We must hold them at Gor Ozumbrog, lest we face a second Last Days!"
 flavor_seghdihr.1.a:0 "Not one step back!"
 flavor_seghdihr.1.tooltip:0 "Goblins from the §YTree of Stone§! will §Rkeep attacking us until they are dealt with§!"

 flavor_seghdihr.2.t:0 "The Old Alliance"
 flavor_seghdihr.2.d:0 "We have recently received an envoy into the halls of Verkal Gulan who claims to carry an important message from the leaders of Seghdihr, our once-sister to the west. They speak of grand plans - of an ambition to reforge the Segbandal and retake the entirety of the middle dwarovar, bringing the light of Dwarven Civilization back to the darkened holds and throwing out the goblin interlopers. They have come first to us, the only other surviving Remnant Hold in the region, asking us to re-enter the Old Alliance.\n\nWhile there may be many advantages to working with Seghdihr again, how can we forget the many times that they trampled our individual rights, overrode our decisions, or lorded their supremacy over us? To join an alliance headed by the Citrine Dwarves would surely see us as junior partners - could the benefits really outweigh the risks?"
 flavor_seghdihr.2.a:0 "Kneel before Seghdihr again? Never!"
 flavor_seghdihr.2.b:0 "To be a part of something greater…perhaps we COULD work together again."

 flavor_seghdihr.3.t:0 "Another Regret"
 flavor_seghdihr.3.d:0 "Our envoy to Verkal Gulan has returned with the unfortunate news that the Gold Dwarves have rejected our offer. It was a vain hope, we suppose, that they would put the memory of our past failures and betrayals behind them, but we could not help but hope."
 flavor_seghdihr.3.a:0 "They refuse peaceful unification - but perhaps force is a language they better understand."

 flavor_seghdihr.4.t:0 "Fool me Once"
 flavor_seghdihr.4.d:0 "As Seghdihr has slowly but surely become less reliant on the Seg Band, pressure has been mounting on [Root.Monarch.GetName] to assuage the fears of the population. This has finally come to a head, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now finally implementing a large amount of checks on the power and influence of mercenaries and adventurers. By royal decree, all mercenary companies that enter the service of Seghdihr will have royal inspectors assigned to them, which continually test the combat readiness, discipline, and above all else the loyalty of their troops. Through these new bureaucratic safeguards, [Root.Monarch.GetName] hopes to ensure that events like the fall of the Segbandal will not be repeated."
 flavor_seghdihr.4.a:0 "Never again."

 flavor_seghdihr.5.t:0 "Into the Future, as One."
 flavor_seghdihr.5.d:0 "While it is true that the circumstances that led to the fall of the Segbandal would have been devastating either way, its structure was the key weakness. The fact that all the holds were independent meant each could refuse to aid the others. This will never happen again. An alliance no more, the Segbandal will be a union of holds, led by one Bright-King. For bright we are: five bright holds, lights in the great darkness of the Dwarovar. Our bright gates reflect the desert sun of the Salahad and our bright future is contrasted to our dark and troubled past. Each finger of this hand must work together."
 flavor_seghdihr.5.a:0 "And we will be the thumb."
 flavor_seghdihr.5.tooltip:0 "We will lose §Y5§!£dip£ for every province our vassals hold that isn't in their §YCapital state§! or is the §YHero's Vale§!"

 ######Part2######
 flavor_seghdihr.6.t:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
 flavor_seghdihr.6.d:0 "Acrid sulphur odours drift from the cannon ranges through the halls of Verkal Gulan along with the echoing thunderous roars of artillery like never before. The soldiers trained here have proven themselves to be an excellent force for our nation and local commanders believe that they could be pushed to be even more capable. Three proposals for specialised training have been put forth by the commanders of the soldiers here. These options are: focus on anti-infantry techniques with grapeshot, or improve the mobility of our artillery and our general tactical training, or, finally, pour our efforts into perfecting massive siege cannons to shatter enemy fortifications. These are all valuable initiatives, but we can only focus on one."
 flavor_seghdihr.6.a:0 "Grapeshot will greet our enemies on the field."
 flavor_seghdihr.6.b:0 "Well placed shots and manoeuvrable artillery will ensure no position is unassailable."
 flavor_seghdihr.6.c:0 "Sheer firepower will break any wall that stands before us!"

 flavor_seghdihr.7.t:0 "Eternal Watch"
 flavor_seghdihr.7.d:0 "Gor Ozumbrog's garrisons are restored and the soldiers that train here have the opportunity to learn specialised tactics that will make them a greater asset to our nation. Three proposals for specialised training have been put forth by the commanders of the soldiers here. The proposals are: focus on drilling our soldiers to march and move with extreme swiftness, or to take and hold positions with stubborn ferocity, or to harass and sabotage our foes with asymmetric warfare. These are all valuable initiatives, but we can only focus on one."
 flavor_seghdihr.7.a:0 "Speed is everything. We move like lightning!"
 flavor_seghdihr.7.b:0 "Let them break against our positions like waves crashing on the shore!"
 flavor_seghdihr.7.c:0 "They shall fall to a thousand cuts from blades unseen!"

 flavor_seghdihr.8.t:0 "Final Verdict"
 flavor_seghdihr.8.d:0 "The matter of the Seg Band is too complicated a problem to solve with complex  political strategies. The grudges, the mistrust, the hatred… It does not disappear with reforms and laws. For the grudges to die, the Seg Band must die. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has given the order that the mercenary company be dismantled immediately, with every member being given the choice: join the army, or leave forever. The suspicions will undoubtedly carry over to the individual members, but these grudges should not survive a generation. The tainted symbol they stood for is gone. At last, we may move forward."
 flavor_seghdihr.8.a:0 "Their mercenary days are over."
 flavor_seghdihr.8.tooltip:0 "The §YSeg Band§! mercenary company will be §Rdisabled§!"

 flavor_seghdihr.9.t:0 "A Peerless Army"
 flavor_seghdihr.9.d:0 "While we will ever aim to improve it, we have at long last assembled an army worthy of the Segbandal. Loyal to the crown, not coin. It is an army that knows no fear, doubt, or weakness. The memories of the fall of the Segbandal will never fade, but we now have the instrument that will prevent its repeat. An army that will never fail"
 flavor_seghdihr.9.a:0 "Never again."

 flavor_seghdihr.10.t:0 "Standing Strong"
 flavor_seghdihr.10.d:0 "The sounds of troops marching and training echo through the barracks and war halls of Seghdihr. The resolve of our soldiers has been strengthened to the utmost. Those who train here have the opportunity to learn specialised tactics that make them great assets to our nation. Three proposals for specialised training have been put forth by the officers in charge of training: We could focus on improving the fighting spirit of our companies, improving the skills of our officer corps in directing defensive tactics, or mental conditioning to ensure that our men do not break. These are all valuable initiatives, but we can only focus on one."
 flavor_seghdihr.10.a:0 "Morale is everything - let our men go to war with high spirits!"
 flavor_seghdihr.10.b:0 "We are only as strong as our leaders. Focus on the officers."
 flavor_seghdihr.10.c:0 "Supremacy of Will leads to Supremacy on the field."

 flavor_seghdihr.11.t:0 "Rise of the Syndicates"
 flavor_seghdihr.11.d:0 "With both Ovdal Kanzad and Grôzumdihr safely under our benevolent leadership, and the goblins having been fully pushed out of the western Tree of Stone, members of the SGC have begun petitioning that we shift  both Ovdal Kanzad and Grôzumdihr into business-oriented arrangements, operated by a council of semi-independent commercial cartels, syndicates and guilds. These Cartel Syndicate states would focus on creating their own standing militaries to patrol the caves and roads, alongside blunting any further goblin incursions. This will spare our own military infrastructure from risking losses of quality in attempting to expand our efforts in garrisoning and patrols. With the establishments of these Cartel Syndicates in both Ovdal Kanzad and Grôzumdihr, we can allow the local administrations to focus on minor problems that would have otherwise burdened the SGC, as we focus on further development of our access to Halessi trade. "
 flavor_seghdihr.11.a:0 "An excellent idea!"
 flavor_seghdihr.11.tooltip:0 "Our lands in the western §YTree of Stone§! will be split among our §YSyndicates§!"
 flavor_seghdihr.11.tooltip2:0 "We will now be able to embargo §Gthree§! §Ynon-rival§! countries with §Yno penalty§!"

 flavor_seghdihr.12.t:0 "Those that Remain"
 flavor_seghdihr.12.d:0 "There is really only one way to deal with the now leaderless retinues of the noble families: enlist them into the army, spread them out over different units, and make their pay generous enough as to not let them slip back into old habits. They may not be properly prepared for war yet, but their work for the nobles has certainly given them some experience."
 flavor_seghdihr.12.a:0 "They could use some proper army training."

 flavor_seghdihr.13.t:0 "The Southern Assembly"
 flavor_seghdihr.13.d:0 "The assembly hall, the largest that had yet been reclaimed in Seghdihr, was filled to the brim with invited notables and audiences from the five holds of the refounded Segbandal. Over a thousand delegates to the assembly had come for the first meeting of the so-called Segamlavad, or “Southern Assembly”, and the air was electric with talk about the many issues facing our nation. When the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Seghdihr took the podium to deliver the opening remarks of the meeting, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was met with thunderous applause.\n\nWhen [Root.Monarch.GetName] finished their speech, the next dwarf to rise proposed a new honour to be bestowed upon the Citrine Crown - a new surname that better represents the union of the five holds.  Where previously the Citrine Kings had been styled “az-segh” or “of the South”, the dwarven assembly proposed that the kings of a united Segbandal should be styled for what they were - the heart of the nation; the az-Hargûn.The Segbandal is the heart of the Dwarovar, Seghdihr is the heart of the Segbandal, and now all recognize our monarch as the heart of our nation."
 flavor_seghdihr.13.a:0 "Long may the az-Hargûn preside over the Segamlavad!"

 flavor_seghdihr.14.t:0 "Tireless Training"
 flavor_seghdihr.14.d:0 "Those who train here have the opportunity to learn specialised tactics that will make them a great asset to our nation. Three proposals for specialised training have been put forth by the officers in charge of training: We could focus on ensuring our men are drilled as extensively as possible, accelerating their training process, or putting more of the population through these many combat drills so we have ample reserves. These are all valuable initiatives, but we can only focus on one."
 flavor_seghdihr.14.a:0 "Put the men through more trials. Make sure the lessons stick."
 flavor_seghdihr.14.b:0 "Let's see if we can't cut these training times in half!"
 flavor_seghdihr.14.c:0 "If everyone is trained, then we will never run out of capable soldiers."

 flavor_seghdihr.15.t:0 "Heavy Armaments"
 flavor_seghdihr.15.d:0 "Molten steel burbles and is forged into armour and weaponry at the Hargûnforge of Hehodovar, and those who march through its halls don the finest of equipment known in all of the Segbandal. Easy access to the high quality equipment here affords our men many opportunities to learn new methods of war, and we can tune the great production heart of our nation to produce whatever we choose to focus on. Should we have our men focus on endurance training in their heavy armour to hone their indefatigable spirit, improve our defensive formations to protect our soldiers from firearms, or dedicate time to melee combat to ensure that our skill in hand-to-hand fighting never declines?"
 flavor_seghdihr.15.a:0 "Have them march until their armour feels no heavier than cloth!"
 flavor_seghdihr.15.b:0 "Practice formations that deflect missile fire."
 flavor_seghdihr.15.c:0 "The old ways are best - drill combat with axes and spears."

 flavor_seghdihr.16.t:0 "Fit to Lead"
 flavor_seghdihr.16.d:0 "With the unification of the five holds of the Middle Dwarovar and the refounding of the Segbandal, it is time to determine where the capital city of our confederation will be. Prominent members of each hold convened in a congress in Seghdihr and, after a short deliberation, the league voted overwhelmingly to formally elevate Seghdihr to be the capital city of the new Segbandal. Though some grumbling longbeards from Verkal Gulan or Hehodovar protested, none are truly surprised - the Citrine City is where the alliance began, and it is where it will always remain."
 flavor_seghdihr.16.a:0 "We shall take up this responsibility and lead the Segbandal to a brighter future!"


 flavor_seghdihr.17.t:0 "The Segbandalic Golden Cartel"
 flavor_seghdihr.17.d:0 ""...and so, we the 57 adventurers, merchants, and wholesalers representing the merchant interests of the Segbandal out of Verkal Gulan do submit to the Bright-King [Root.Monarch.GetName] to grant royal assent in the establishment of a new Cartel Charter, overseen by the Crown, to venture towards the East along the Golden Highway, to the lands of Rahen, Yanshen, Xianje, Thindikai and all other lands which touches the Ringlet Sea and Gulf of Rahen. As the Charter for our Cartel will be granted by the Crown, and we shall operate in the interests of the Crown abroad and at home, we request the right to name our company the Segbandalic Golden Cartel."\n\nOn this day, a group of business interests from Verkal Gulan have petitioned the crown to grant them a royal charter on external trade sourced from Rahen and the Far East, primarily focused upon the regions touched by the Golden Highway in exchange for the crown receiving a direct portion of all profits and proceedings, and, this Cartel swearing to act with the best interests of Crown and Country in mind."
 flavor_seghdihr.17.a:0 "Signed with royal pleasure!"
 flavor_seghdihr.17_tooltip:0 "The §YSegbandalic Golden Cartel§! can be managed in the §Ydecisions menu§! and also have a few §Yunique privileges§! available to them"

 flavor_seghdihr.18.d:0 "The goblin invaders spill forth from the caves in a final desperate attempt to wipe us out, and bring their ruin upon Tree of Stone once more. We shall not allow it, and meet them head on with dwarven steel and lead. As we have repelled incursion after incursion, our resolve has only grown. The Segbandal shall prevail. Our holds will finally know peace!"
 flavor_seghdihr.18.a:0 "Finally!"
 flavor_seghdihr.18.tooltip:0 "§GThe Goblin Incursions are at an end§!"

 flavor_seghdihr.19.t:0 "The Dwarovar Reborn"
 flavor_seghdihr.19.d:0 "Three Segbandals there have been. The first was in ancient history, before the rise of Aul-Dwarov. The Segbandal of that ancient age is mythical in its own right, with little of it known except that both Hehodovar and Seghdihr were part of that alliance. The second Segbandal is one that history is far more familiar with, consisting of the five holds as we know them today. It was this Segbandal which withstood the brunt of the storm that was the Fall of Aul-Dwarov, only to collapse due to the machinations of Jexis and the traitorous Seg Band. But now we have reclaimed what was lost to us and built a legacy of our own making. Let the reclaimers from Cannor in the west squabble over the legacy of Aul-Dwarov. The legacy we leave takes shape as the third Segbandal, consisting of Gor Vazumbrog, Hehodovar, Seghdihr, Verkal Gulan, and Gor Ozumbrog, and there shall never be need for another."
 flavor_seghdihr.19.a:0 "Five as One, forevermore."

 flavor_seghdihr.20.t:0 "The King and Master"
 flavor_seghdihr.20.d:0 "The Xiaken, no matter who rules, only respect one thing: martial skill. In order to expand the influence of the SGC within Xia, the Bright King himself must challenge an unknown, masked representative, representing the Xiaken, in combat. This will not be an easy battle, but it is to first blood. Our king is clad in the best armour Verkal Gulan gold can buy, with a blade forged out of the sharpest steel.\n\nThe only thing left now is to win."

 flavor_seghdihr.21.d:0 "The air was still. The arena is a simple circle of dirt surrounded by bamboo groves and representatives of the Segbandal and the Xiaken. A square of fabric is dropped by a neutral judge. Next rings the sound of clashing steel as Dwarf and Man threw themselves at each other with ferocious measure. The very ground quaked as two titans of the battlefield clashed against each other, throwing themselves into the heat of battle. The masked Xia warrior brought forth a blade as if from nowhere, unleashing a flurry of blows faster than the eye could see. But as he raised his blade high into the air to bring it down upon the Bright King's head, the King parried expertly. The force of the clash of weapons caused the King to drop his weapon, yet, just before the Xia monk can recover, the King jumped up into the air and slammed his gauntleted fist into the warrior's jaw. The man stumbles, and spits blood. The match was won. The King is victorious. The SGC may expand into the lands of the Xia."

A goblin sighting here or there, but never in numbers enough to elicit express concern on their own. Together, however, they paint a picture of goblins scouting out the local area. For what reasons, we can only guess- but none of them are good."

 flavor_seghdihr.52.d:0 "Goblin thieves have been rampaging through [Root.incursion_target.GetName]. At first it wasn't anything for authorities to be concerned about too greatly. A ransacked shed here, a caravan looted there: all things well in the scope of local authorities. But as of recently the scale and scope of these thefts has exploded, with the most recent being an entire arms shipment to the local garrison having been stolen, including weapons and ammunition. It's obvious to see that things will only escalate from here."

Unfortunately, even this number does not even begin to match the amount of missing equipment that has been stolen or disappeared.

These were the last words of a bloodstained report handed to the commander of the local garrison from a nearby patrol post in [Root.incursion_target.GetName]. It was shortly followed by a horde of goblins, far larger in size than the first laying siege to the main settlement. A single runner managed to escape and bring us news before the assault began in earnest, bringing us news and requests for immediate relief, before the goblins can seize the province and slaughter the local populace."

Many proclaimed him their god reborn and so he began to forge his great Phoenix Empire. Though the Surani came to preach of their reborn god, now called Surael, we humoured them, but no god of men or elves could make us turn from honouring our ancestors as we have since time immemorial. Whether or not Jaher was Surael reborn or not, we had an excellent arrangement with him. We funded his blockade of Ovdal Tûngr and provided him the service of the Seg Band for his personal guard. In exchange, we became the foremost and most trusted source of Dwarven expertise across Bulwar and the burgeoning Phoenix Empire. This simple, effective arrangement allowed Jaher to focus his expansion eastwards, towards Rahen and beyond. A pity that his daughter, Jexis, did not have his wisdom and instead she turned the Seg Band against their own kin."

Now, where scholars studied, engineers invented, and proud artisans worked, there is only a hollow shell. Squatting within are the creatures that defiled the holy works of Hehogrim.\n\nOne faction within Seghdihr has long argued that the reclamation of Hehodovar must be our foremost task if we ever hope to ensure the safety of our hold.

Some of these places that were spared absolute destruction may still hold remnants of ancient knowledge. We should restore the workshops, laboratories, and schools of the Engineer's Hold and encourage our brightest minds to teach and work here. Who knows what they will achieve when they walk the same halls as the greatest inventors in the history of our people once did."

Though rarely opened after the end of the original Segbandal, it lies at the far edge of the Salahad, in territory that once belonged to harpykind and desert tribes. Now, our allies in Azka-Sur control the territory in front of both gates, and we control the territory within the mountains.

Our pettiness and suspicion damaged our alliance and our individual holds have never been as mighty or as prosperous as we were when we stood united. Our strengths compliment each other: We provide longstanding trade and diplomatic relations with the Surani people and access to the riches of Bulwar while easily acquirable and seemingly endless gold pours forth from the mines and refineries of Verkal Gulan.

The Gold Dwarves sealed themselves in their hold when the Segbandal was broken three hundred years ago and they have remained shut off from the world, their golden fortunes gathering dust in the innumerable vaults within their city.\n\nWith the rebirth of our alliance and improved security along renewed trade routes, the paranoia and isolation of the Gold Dwarves is becoming harder for them to justify. Now is the time to reconnect the Golden Citadel with the outside world, reopen the Hero's Gate, and welcome the world's traders and merchants back. Soon, the markets of Verkal Gulan will be filled with exotic, foreign goods and people once again.

Now comes the question of what to do with them. Grôzumdihr opens a new path into Rahen, and Ovdal Kanzad's weapon forges are churning out the most advanced firearms for our armies. Many of our advisors state that the Tree of Stone can be a very prosperous economic strongpoint. Therefore, a new solution is required for their current status."

The newly rechristened az-Hargûn dynasty has seen the requests by the inventors and smiths of the hold as an excellent opportunity to make their beneficence known, and plans have been drawn up to build an appropriately great forge in the industrial heart of Hehodovar.

As we re-emerge onto the world stage, we have the opportunity to once again involve ourselves in the trade that flourishes along the Golden Highway. At the strategic bottleneck of the ancient Harpy's Gate, we can establish a trading outpost to facilitate the flow of goods to the otherwise inaccessible Verkal Gulan, trading the treasures of the Golden Citadel for the rich silks and spices of Rahen before they even reach Azka-Sur."

Access to the Western Gulf of Rahen will be key in securing trade coming from there, which means ensuring that merchants along the Golden Highway are coming to us and not elsewhere. The most important key in all of our plans in extending the Golden Cartel's influence, regardless, is Davharral. Its size betrays its importance as a place where Rahen and Bulwar meet. Our improvements along the Golden Highways may be a start, but a concerted effort involving those governing the city will be required in order to properly ensure that we possess accurate charts of Rahen and secure a safe location for caravans and business ventures."

The consent of these slaves turned into slavers, either explicit or implied, is all that stands in the way of the SGC reaching into the markets of the Far East.

 estate_burghers_sgc_merchant_training_desc:0 "The profession of merchant is not a simple one, and most that wish to enter tend to pick up on the finer details by serving as apprentices under senior merchants. This is usually only achieved by those of already affluent backgrounds, which leads to a limited pool of merchants.

This concept is not always entirely put into practice, however, as perfectly good trade ventures are snubbed by merchants that are not quite comfortable with their prospective trading partners. The appointing of royal inspectors to oversee this may ensure that these merchants do not let their personal feelings get in the way of good profit."

Especially with identical trade goods of predictable value, more tends to be better, which is something that the Dwarovar rail has always excelled at when it was in operation. We ought to apply these principles to the caravans of the Segbandalic Golden Cartel, and transport our trade goods in bulk."

As their experience laid mostly with furniture, shipbuilding and ship repair has required them to coordinate with one another far more, and often defer to the expertise of local craftsmen. As they have gotten settled in, however, most have taken a liking to their new profession, and take pride in their work. And in rare cases, some dwarves have even chosen to sail on the ships that they helped build."

 flavor_seghdihr.131.d:0 "As the Ghankedhen tax code is based on old dwarven legal systems, the SGC has taken it upon themselves to assist the Ghankedhen lords in modernising their tax laws and establish new diplomatic ties and stronger relationships in the process. The locals are only too happy to work with the SGC on establishing new trade routes, sensing opportunities in the competition between the SGC and the Raheni merchants from the south and east who currently control most of the trade in the region."
 flavor_seghdihr.131.a:0 "To friendship!"
 flavor_seghdihr.132.d:0 "It is not a simple task to keep the harimari lords satisfied. The SGC has been trying to butter up every official with any power along the Dhenbasana river, with mixed success. In general, the harimari do not seem to like that the SGC is more or less independent from the caste system and undercuts the divisions imposed on middle caste merchants. On the other hand, the fact that the SGC is casteless means that they can cede trade concessions in return for gifts without dishonouring themselves by submitting to the lower castes, which gives us a competitive advantage."
 flavor_seghdihr.132.a:0 "Very well."


 flavor_seghdihr.141.d:0 "Obtaining elephants from Sharaajaghal has proven to be far easier than the SGC anticipated, as the elephant lords are quite eager for their animals to be used in the trade caravans. It allows them to display the capabilities of the elephants far beyond their border, through all the cities that the SGC conducts trade in. As such, they have offered their elephants at very low prices as the elephant lords all take great pride in their elephants being seen."
 flavor_seghdihr.141.a:0 "All the better."

 flavor_seghdihr.142.d:0 "The Segbandalic Golden Cartel has been acting as a middle man between local Elephant lords and mercenaries, as there seemed to be a demand among them for forces to unify the region. The sheer amount of contracts is something the SGC was not prepared for. Every minor noble seems to be intent on being the one to unite the Ghaavanaj people and rise as the new Black King of Sharaajaghal, regardless of truces or previous oaths of fealty."
 flavor_seghdihr.142.a:0 "They sure are a contentious people."


 flavor_seghdihr.151.d:0 "Initially, sponsoring dwarven scholars and philosophers to attend the libraries of Shamakhad was unpopular with everyone. The dwarves were not eager to move out of the Dwarovar and the Shamakhad scholars seemingly did not believe the dwarves could contribute to their discussions. However, after several well-placed gifts by the SGC the accommodations were made regardless. True enough, after the first couple of heated debates the libraries became more interested in these 'dwarven perspectives', and more dwarven scholars have travelled to Rajnadhaga without SGC incentives for the opportunity to shout expletives at "learned human philosophers"."
 flavor_seghdihr.151.a:0 "It's like a marketplace of ideas!"
 flavor_seghdihr.152.d:0 "The former lands of the Nadimraj have rarely known a secure peace, what with the conflicts with the Harimraj and the threat of the Hobgoblins looming over the land. Because of this, dwarven warriors to help garrison the forts and city walls are more than welcome, and the SGC is more than willing to provide them, in return for the right concessions."
 flavor_seghdihr.152.a:0 "Good doing business."

 flavor_seghdihr.161.d:0 "The Segbandalic Golden Cartel is far from the only trade organisation to set up a headquarters in Sramaya, considering how vital the city is for the Trade between Rahen and eastern Haless. There are advantages and disadvantages to this. There is very sharp competition, but also we have a good opportunity to directly deal with competitors and other mercantile groups. It has taken no time at all for this new eastern headquarters to become just as active as the main SGC headquarters."
 flavor_seghdihr.161.a:0 "New opportunities you say?"
 flavor_seghdihr.162.d:0 "Getting involved in slave trade is murky business, and is not popular among the population of the Segbandal. As such, it has to be publicized as a freeing of slaves first and foremost - The SGC knows perfectly well that buying and freeing slaves incentivizes the slave market, but this is by far the easiest way to provide our merchants with cheap labour indebted to them without causing an uproar."
 flavor_seghdihr.162.a:0 "For liberty!"

 flavor_seghdihr.171.d:0 "The Xia are proud of their martial skill, and are only too eager to test it against the famed Segbandalic warriors. Old veterans of the Segankâr that travel to these new sparring grounds are very welcome and they are treated with great respect. They are given generous lodging in return for occasionally training with the locals."
 flavor_seghdihr.171.a:0 "As well they should."
 flavor_seghdihr.172.d:0 "Good martial ability deserves good steel, and the Segbandalic Golden Cartel can provide. With dwarven-forged weaponry, the SGC has found eager customers among the Xia, in the form of both their traditional weapons as well as more dwarven designs. In turn, fighting with dwarven weaponry has given rise to new schools of martial arts among their people."
 flavor_seghdihr.172.a:0 "Better schools, of course."

 flavor_seghdihr.181.d:0 "From Khiraspid to Sarisung, in the markets of Sempherong and Keyattordha and Phangban, bidding wars erupt over the rare ores that the SGC has brought from the distant mountains. Mithril is the word on every maker’s lips, and the demand for the precious metal is high wherever we turn. Already rumors circulate of the experiments being run on lattices and suffused clays, and this competition will certainly only breed more calls for the ore. Though prices are already high, it seems that we will make a killing off of this trade as humans begin to discover secrets that dwarves have known since ancient days about the mastery of mithril."
 flavor_seghdihr.181.a:0 "May their treasures by strengthened by ours."
 flavor_seghdihr.182.d:0 "High up on the lonely mountain of Tughayasa, the Oracular Order spends their days in contemplation of the universe, their monastery of Mindarandaya isolated from the world. But that isolation leaves them vulnerable and unable to interpret their own prophecies, so blind to the world below as they are. The Segbandalic Golden Cartel has thus found an unequalled opportunity in dealing with the monks - knowledge for knowledge. By providing the scholars with information about the world, they have been willing to share some of their knowledge in return. While much is indecipherable, we have learned much in the way of philosophy and been informed of potentially profitable trades, seeing much wealth flow into our coffers thanks to these occasional glimpses of the future."
 flavor_seghdihr.182.a:0 "Very good!"
