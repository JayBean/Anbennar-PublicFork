 flavour_ordstun.1.t:0 "Of Two Diamond Queens"
 flavour_ordstun.1.d:0 "Over the past two decades, the orcish armies who once haunted our doors first scattered, then disappeared entirely. Our diviners, methodically scrying every cavern around us, have found only disorganized tribes without power or purpose. Something or someone has driven the orcs away, and our Queen plans to seize this opportunity.\n\nMuch of the hold’s populace, including its reformists and radicals, rally to Queen Ardeginn XXII Whiteforged’s banner. Far more of it, though-- especially the old Clans, Lapidaries, and Stonekeepers-- stand against her. We may have defeated the Beholden for now, but their advocates still dominate our manors, guilds, and temples. They have been isolated from the world for millennia, and they do not plan on surrendering to our Queen even an ounce of the power hoarded in this time.\n\nSix thousand years ago, Sigrid Stormheart, the Diamond Queen, closed the gates of Arg-Ôrdstun. Now, we have a new Diamond Queen who has opened these gates to the world. By rebuking the very traditions which have kept this hold alive, she ignites the true war for the fate of our nation."

 flavour_ordstun.44.b:0 "If they do not like the carrot, they get the stick!"

 flavour_ordstun.100.t:0 "The Critical Angle"
 flavour_ordstun.100.d:0 "A Diamond is formed only when the whole weight of the world rests upon it - it must be capable of withstanding the greatest of pressure and heat, or it will splinter into nothing. When we opened the gates of our hold, we could afford to be no different. Our nation has not been easy to govern, but with each revolt, each complication, each pressure, we have not broken: no, these conflicts have strengthened us, refined us, polished us to a brilliant shine. We have faced the Beholden reactionaries, the backwards-looking pretenders, and the clans and lapidaries demanding domination over our country. We have assimilated dwarves from across Halann, moderated the right to conflict within government halls, and determined national policies of land and conquest. We have, throughout all of this, maintained stability, increased our control, and destroyed every threat to Arg-Ôrdstun. By centralizing authority, we have unified and united the spirit of our nation.\n\nOur chamber of government, the “Gleaming Council,” has often failed to live up to its name. It has been a palace of schemes, plots, backstabbing, corruption, bribery, and incompetence: but it shall be so no longer. The Council will gleam as a place of unity and cohesion, where all parts of Diamond society work together under our direct supervision. Through the will of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], assented to by the Council, the entire nation shall glow. We shine with luster, and the world will envy the Diamond Dwarves."
 flavour_ordstun.100.a:0 "Through the Council, we will outshine all our peers!"

 flavour_ordstun.101.t:0 "A Legacy of Rebellion"
 flavour_ordstun.101.d:0 "In the empire of Aul-Dwarov, Arg-Ôrdstun made a name for itself by advocating for the downtrodden. Our rulers rallied against King’s Rock, constantly demanding more rights, privileges, and honors for those who made the Empire function. When the High King was so corrupted by wealth as to invite the Ruby Hold into our nation, we led the charge against him: and in that War of the Bloody Gem, we forever broke the tyranny of central rule. The High King never truly controlled us again, and we, not Amldihr, dominated the Serpentreach. We shall always remember this legacy as proof of our perseverance against injustice and corruption.\n\nThe problem, now, is that this legacy is being turned against us. Our nobles each see themselves as a Diamond Dwarf fighting against a tyrannical ruler: but that ruler is our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], not the despots in Amldihr. One clan, led by a dwarf wearing robes in the style of a Dwarovic Diamond, declares that we must concede to all of their demands. If we roll back our centralizing reforms, their leader says, Arg-Ôrdstun will be at peace: but if we hold steady, he will ignite a conflict the likes of which has been unseen since the War of the Bloody Gem. This is, in all likelihood, no more than just bluster: but should we risk the wrath of the nobles? Shall we risk arms being taken up against our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 flavour_ordstun.101.a:0 "No consumed rebel will see us concede."
 flavour_ordstun.101.b:0 "Grant some minor concessions."

 flavour_ordstun.102.t:0 "Foreign Clans Demand Recognition"
 flavour_ordstun.102.d:0 "We have grown in power and wealth since spreading into the Serpentspine, and this power has led to dwarves from abroad requesting entry into our nation. We have happily taken them in, for we need aid in colonizing the caverns... but this wave of migrants has not arrived without tensions. Surface dwarves have lost many of the old arts which we have kept alive: they know little of faceting, or ancient firepower, or deliberative governance. On the other hand, they know of many things which we do not: they speak of nations, peoples, inventions, and ways of life which we had never previously imagined.\n\nThese new dwarves, an increasingly-important part of Diamond government, have come to demand a place in our administration. They see the power our clans wield in the Gleaming Council, and seek to be a part of it themselves: and so they have assembled significant evidence supporting their claims. Many of these dwarves descend from clans who once fled the dying Aul-Dwarov, and so have legitimacy as heirs of ancient families and ancient titles. To accept them into governance would not only solidify our position as the rightful ruler of all dwarves, but would also bring us much-needed knowledge of the outside world.\n\nOn the other hand, of course, the old clans would be incensed by this betrayal. They promise us cooperation and levies if we hold fast to their traditional rights, but there is a question of whether we want to prioritize these rights at all. Do we side with the old, and maintain the powers of the Diamonds? Or do we side with the new, and see where outside innovations may lead?"
 flavour_ordstun.102.a:0 "Deny the foreign clans recognition or representation!"
 flavour_ordstun.102.b:0 "Assimilate the foreign clans into our own!"

 flavour_ordstun.103.t:0 "The Right to Conflict"
 flavour_ordstun.103.d:0 "One of the core principles of Diamond administration is the right to conflict. Since time immemorial, we have refused to stay silent whenever injustice is upon us, and this principle is expressed in every aspect of our society. Ancient Diamond monarchs stood up to the High King; clan-leaders demand fatal duels when their honor is aggrieved; rival sects of priests publicly denounce one another for minor theological differences. We have never been strangers to serious - and even violent - confrontation. It is vital to who we are.\n\nThis culture of conflict extends well into our Gleaming Council: and as of late, it has only intensified. Surely, we are used to clan-leaders calling us oppressors, saying our reforms will doom the entirety of Arg-Ôrdstun, and instigating fist-fights with our loyal supporters. On the other hand, we are less familiar with the growing number of clans who actively call for the overthrow of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As we become more powerful and centralized, it seems that many of our nobles and guild-leaders are using this ancient right to conflict as a means to call for active rebellion and revolution.\n\nWhat shall we do about these troublemakers? Shall we attempt to appease them, and insist publicly that their rights to disagreement are protected by law? Or shall we show the would-be radicals who truly owns this hold, and ensure that they do not plot our deaths before our own faces?"
 flavour_ordstun.103.a:0 "Fall in line or be stripped of power!"
 flavour_ordstun.103.b:0 "The right to conflict is sacrosanct."

 flavour_ordstun.104.t:0 "The Revolt of the Clans"
 flavour_ordstun.104.d:0 "As we grow, our Gleaming Council’s venerable clans gain more power: but we have been evolving faster than they have. As we spread to new holds, roads, and caverns, the old clans lack the capacity to establish control over every piece of Diamond territory. We, on the other hand, with a growing bureaucracy and a pool of loyal dwarves, grow stronger by the year. The clans have noticed this trend, and plan to put a stop to it. Before they truly lose power - before they are left in the dust as mere figureheads to be ignored - they have decided to take a stand. They are demanding that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] step down, and that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] distant relative, Harruk Whiteforged, be placed in charge of Arg-Ôrdstun.\n\nUnlike previous petitions, this is not a mere complaint or a passing fad. For years, Harruk has rallied the clans to his side, utterly convinced of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s weakness: and for decades, the defeated Beholden have lobbied the nation’s nobles to renounce our rule. As the clans’ power wanes, their prospects weaken, their allies grow belligerent, and their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] centralizes power, it seems that they have determined it is finally time to fight. Levies have been raised in every hold we own, preemptively ready to strike against our guards and soldiers. This ultimatum is one we cannot ignore.\n\nWe can, though, attempt to fight it. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a choice: whether to abdicate, or to plunge Arg-Ôrdstun into a mess of fratricidal conflict. What shall [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] choose to do? Will the nobles triumph, or shall they be crushed?"
 flavour_ordstun.104.a:0 "Beholden of the past, we will render you extinct!"
 flavour_ordstun.104.b:0 "Our monarch shall abdicate, for the good of the nation!"

 flavour_ordstun.105.t:0 "The Question of Land Rights"
 flavour_ordstun.105.d:0 "As we conquer ever-increasing amounts of the Serpentreach, we find ourselves with more caverns, roads, and holds than we know what to do with. Our success is an incredible feat of Diamond ingenuity, but it also poses a question: who gets to own all this land? Land rights were simple when we were isolated, but we cannot rely on claims of inheritance for territories which no dwarf has touched for thousands of years. We are left with three options for how ownership could be determined.\n\nFirst, we could assign new lands to whoever manages to initially claim and settle them. This would strengthen the adventurers of our society, as only those brave and crazy enough to walk into a den of monsters would be able to claim ownership of it.\n\nSecond, we could divide the land between our estates. We would grant parts of it to each of them, assuring that they work with us in the coming years without letting any particular group become too powerful.\n\nThird, we could take control of all of this land ourselves. This would be deeply challenging - we do not have the government apparatus required to control every nook and cranny of the Serpentreach - but we could certainly try. This would, at least, mean that our clans do not become more powerful.\n\nHow should we handle the question of land rights?"
 flavour_ordstun.105.a:0 "Whoever can colonize caverns deserves the land!"
 flavour_ordstun.105.b:0 "Split the land between the estates, so that none monopolize it!"
 flavour_ordstun.105.c:0 "We will control all land in Arg-Ôrdstun ourselves!"
 flavour_ordstun.105.d:0 "Split the land between the estates; we know how to manage them!" 

 flavour_ordstun.106.t:0 "The Lapidary Monopoly"
 flavour_ordstun.106.d:0 "The Lapidary Guilds, as the centerpiece of our nation’s industry and prestige, have long monopolized gem production in Arg-Ôrdstun. In the power vacuum opened up by the decline of the Clans - for even Harruk Whiteforged’s revolt was unable to stop the Clans’ decline in influence and power forever - the Lapidaries have reached towards ever-greater heights. They now buy out failing noble families’ assets, and purchase their rivals’ operations in mining copper, iron, gold, and mithril. It is clear that the Lapidaries aim to dominate all mining operations in the Serpentreach, if not the entire Serpentspine.\n\nWe can react to this development in two ways. First, we could allow the Lapidaries to expand, but only if they pay for it. If they are willing to compensate the state, and aid in general administration, they may buy or sell whatever they wish. This could lead to a great windfall in assets, which we dearly need.\n\nOn the other hand, we could force the Lapidaries to sell their shares to the state. This would be gravely expensive, but it would keep the Guilds firmly within their own industry, and ensure that their power does not expand past where it should.\n\nHow shall we handle this growing Lapidary expansionism?"
 flavour_ordstun.106.a:0 "Allow the Guilds to buy expansion rights."
 flavour_ordstun.106.b:0 "Force them to sell their shares to the state!"
 flavour_ordstun.106.c:0 "We’ve dealt with monopolists before, we can do it again!" 

 flavour_ordstun.107.t:0 "A Compliant Council?"
 flavour_ordstun.107.d:0 "Something we never could have predicted is happening. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] recently entered the Gleaming Council to propose our newest set of reforms, and the Council actually agreed to implement them. There was debate, of course - and some members of the Lapidary Guilds remained firmly in opposition - but there were no threats against us, nor speeches denouncing our rule, nor announcements of violent revolution. The debate lasted for two hours, after which the council voted sixty-five percent in favor of our proposal. Everything went... smoothly. Too smoothly.\n\nOur agents are now working overtime to try and figure out what the clans, guilds, and temples are hiding from us. They must be scheming in some way or another, and are simply trying to make us lower our guard. They will not trick us, though, and we will be vigilant. We know the Council would never agree with us of their own volition!"
 flavour_ordstun.107.a:0 "At least the reform was passed..."

 flavour_ordstun.108.t:0 "The Lapidary Revolt"
 flavour_ordstun.108.d.1:0 "For thousands of years, the Lapidaries have monopolized our gem trade. As we expanded throughout the Serpentreach, they bought out nearly all the mining operations in our nation. Now, after being granted all of these privileges and all of these rights, the Lapidary Guilds repay us for our kindness by launching a full-blown revolt.\n\nFrom every center of gem, copper, iron, gold, and mithril production throughout Arg-Ôrdstun, the Lapidaries demand total capitulation. They have laid out a program which would give them perpetual control over the entire economy, from agriculture to mining to production to export. They are not allowing us to negotiate, or propose lesser terms: we have the option of conceding, or of fighting them. With the power we allowed them to amass over the decades, fighting them will not be easy.\n\nHow do we react to this revolt of guildsmen and lapidaries? Do we accept their demands, or fight tooth-and-nail over every mine in the nation?"
 flavour_ordstun.108.d.2:0 "For thousands of years, the Lapidaries have monopolized the gem trade. As we have expanded through the Serpentreach, though, we refused to allow them to dominate every institution of mining and minerals throughout our nation. For daring to deny them full control, they now repay us by launching into a full-blown revolt.\n\nFrom every center of gem production throughout Arg-Ôrdstun, the Lapidaries demand total capitulation.

 flavour_ordstun.109.t:0 "The Final Cuts"
 flavour_ordstun.109.d:0 "As all lapidaries know, cutting gemstones into fine pieces of art is a laborious task. This process is monumentally more difficult for the hardest gemstones: and there is no stone harder to cut than a diamond. Despite this, we slowly-- carefully-- facet the Diamond of our nation. With the Lapidary Revolt over, and with the Revolt of the Clans long in the past, our government has finally started to sparkle with the sheen of a well-cut gem. Our glow begins to resemble the Arg-Ôrdstun which once ruled the Serpentreach."
