When our Diamond Queen Ardeginn XXII opened Arg-Ôrdstun’s doors to the Dwarovar, we thought nothing could be more radical: but now, we open our gates to the surface.\n\nOur emissaries leave on missions, and they find dwarves aplenty. Admittedly, this has not been easy: there are so many humans (which are very common nowadays), goblins (which we know all too well), and elves (which have apparently lost just as much as we have in the years since Aul-Dwarov). Even worse, our explorers must brave the blinding sun, the heat of deserts, the horrific openness of the sky, and the concerning depths of the ocean. This is all worth it, though, for dwarves who hear our name are filled with awe and trepidation. They understand what our resurgence means for the Dwarovar.\n\nAfter six thousand years of hibernation, the Diamond Dwarves have returned to the world. Now, it is time for the dwarves of the world to return to us."

Here, though, in these expansive caverns, fear fills the air. Their walls are not engraved with familiar stories; ruins are everywhere, untouched except for bloodstains from an unknown age; there are miniature bands of orcs and goblins prowling in the dark. We keep expecting a war, a catastrophe, a great band of orcs to erupt from the depths and slay every dwarf we have ever known. So far, this has not happened. We can only pray that our luck continues..."

This used to be a place of honor: the rails would run daily from Shazstundihr, to Arg-Ôrdstun, to Orlghelovar, and vice-versa, carrying glass, gems, and marble that were as plentiful as Serpentbloom. Dwarves were plentiful, too; in every story we have heard from our ancestors, this triangle of holds was prosperous and beloved. Now, we all live in ruins.\n\nWe imagine how many dwarves used to live here. Was it thousands; hundreds of thousands; millions? The records do not say, and we cannot know. We have occasionally seen the depths of our own hold, but we understand not how deep it leads. Could all of these holds have gone so deep? Did all of them contain enough people to support such great works? Did all of them die, were all of them killed by orcs who did nothing with their plunder? Did our prosperous empire fall for nothing, for no one to even use what we had built?"

Crystalline glassware and finely-faceted diamonds are shipped out of the Serpentspine, and they are exchanged for surface novelties we find entirely enticing. These human kingdoms, strange as they are, have such an abundance of delicious fruits, delicate woodcrafts, and bountiful sources of meat and grain.

You are supposed to pretend that surface wine does not taste like swill. Some dwarves have abandoned not only the old gods, but also their ancestors, and worship human gods alongside a dwarf named “Balgar.” Surface dwarves really love this “Balgar,” and do not like it when we say we do not know who he is. You are not supposed to look at the sun, even for a second. Humans are dangerous when desperate. Elves have fully forgotten that they destroyed us, and are rather apologetic about it when reminded. Humans do not like the taste of Serpentbloom. Their language is surprisingly similar to ours.\n\nAll of these things we have learned, and mastered, so that we might make more contact with the surface. We grow in stature, so that the nations of Bulwar and Cannor might understand our rightful role in this world."

We honor each dwarf who died, but also all of those who survived: and whose children, and children’s children, have toiled in a hold which has never seen the Dwarovar. We grieve for those who gave our life for us... and we grieve for every generation locked away from our fate, away from the Serpentreach our ancestors called home.”\n\nJust out of sight, wary of what the mages might report, clan patriarchs seethe with unrestrained contempt. Nobles trade in arms and secrets, plotting against [Root.Monarch.GetName] for upsetting the status quo. But in every window and every home, the Diamond dwarves stare out at the street.

The empire of Aul-Dwarov had already fallen, the dwarves of the Serpentreach were retreating into their holds, and the warbands were unceasing. We lost thousands of good dwarves– and a king– in the fighting: but the king’s daughter, Sigrid Stormheart, took the crown. She filled the Diamond Quarry with traps, used its winches as weapons and its tunnels as trenches, and slowed the orcish assault to a crawl. After the immediate threat had ceased, the soon-to-be-proclaimed Diamond Queen did what only she could resolve to do: she shut the doors of Arg-Ôrdstun, permanently forbidding all Diamond Dwarves from leaving. We were to stand ever-defiant as to outlast the orcs.\n\nPerhaps, after six millenia, our outlasting is complete. We knew that the orcs would eventually exhaust themselves, or kill each other, or enter into a war they could not win: and it seems our prediction has finally come true. In the last two decades, the cries of the orcish warbands have quieted, then vanished.\n\nIt will take far more than quiet orcs for us to leave our hold. For countless lifetimes, we have watched, and waited, and grown stagnant. A Diamond Queen shepherded us into isolation, and we will need a second Diamond Queen to shepherd us out..."

 H76_the_crown_jewel_desc:0 "Before Aul-Dwarov, in times which even our oldest records barely remember, we constructed a gem that would be known as the Aegis of the Serpentreach. It was “constructed,” rather than “found,” because it was perfectly faceted: it was a great diamond, larger than a fist, cut in so many directions that it compelled the very minds of those who witnessed it. It was the perfect representation of our power... and also of our follies, for we offered it to the High King of Aul-Dwarov when we joined the Empire. He accepted this gift, choosing it as the keystone of the legendary Dwarovkron. We were made to be the centerpiece of his empire, but, in doing so, lost control over that which we held dearest.\n\nFor centuries, our Stonekeepers have debated whether the Aegis was real or an allegory. (Could we possibly have faceted such a perfect stone before learning of Dwarovic industrial methods? Could a diamond compel those who look at it, simply by being so well-cut? Can a diamond that large even exist?) All of these debates have now been definitively answered, as the Aegis has finally been found. For a new age, we reforge our own Diamond Crown, which was lost so long ago that it cannot even be remembered. For the first time since the fall of Aul-Dwarov– no, for the first time since the founding of Aul-Dwarov– the Aegis is back in the Serpentreach."

Therefore, as the organization which (by proxy) dominates our entire economy, the Guilds have incredible power. A meeting of the Gleaming Council never seems complete without a Lapidary clan ordering our monarch around, making demands, or ensuring that only their clans could profit from new deposits. Now, though, the balance of power is shifting.\n\nAs we expand past the hold and enter the great caverns beyond, we unearth plentiful new mines. We could give the Lapidaries the rights to these mines, which would make them richer, more productive, and more indebted to our rule. On the other hand, we could seize many of these mines for ourselves, and ensure that the jeweler clans are not the only engines at the heart of Arg-Ôrdstun’s growth. The choice is ours, but it is not a simple one: it must be done through policy, influence, legislation, and bribery.

For so long, we have been limited to the clast shafts that make up a large area of the hold - shafts that now only contained shallow deposits of gems after millennia of mining: but now, we can reach back into the caverns, and with them, ever more deposits. By expanding our mining operations, every family of Diamond Dwarves can obtain all the gems they’d ever need! We can expand our lapidary production, and mine enough gems to supply every hold!\n\nSome begin to murmur that we will soon be producing too many gems, and will oversupply the market so fully that diamonds are no longer of any value.

If they do not know to coat wheels with Serpentbloom oil and diamond dust, as to allow these wheels to sharpen and facet gems, we do not care. If they cannot sinter tiny specks of diamond dust into steel as it is forged, then use that diamond-sintered steel as a tool which can cut even the hardest of gems... so be it.

Gems have become so common in our holds that they have become a problem; exactly as some skeptics suggested, the price of gems is spiraling. We have been too successful at extraction, and our economy enters a crisis.\n\nThankfully, by working with the Lapidaries and deftly managing our exports, we have come to a new method of trade. Within the borders of Arg-Ôrdstun, gems shall be sold for next to nothing: but no gem shall leave our borders without being exposed to massive tariffs. Both our government and the Lapidaries will take a cut of these profits, and they will ensure that our gems stay scarce and invaluable on the global market.\n\nThis system has caused the rise of smugglers, no doubt sponsored by those greedy surface traders trying to undermine us. They constantly attempt to unjustly sell our goods at fair market value, to rise against us. It has, too, created an internal currency crisis as gems become cheaper than ever within our halls. This is of no mind! Smugglers shall be slaughtered on sight, and the economy shall surely be fixed with time. This can all be dealt with, one step at a time!"

Its exact boundaries meant nothing, for the Serpentreach only served as a vague reminder of the nation we used to govern.\n\nSince the Second Diamond Queen opened our gates to the world, everything has changed. Just a few short decades ago, we only controlled an old hold and its memories; now, we dominate an entire arm of the Dwarovar. Our inexorable expansion has seen that “Serpentreach” reclaimed, and we set our sights on the future.\n\nAt the apex of old Arg-Ôrdstun’s power, our ancestors were locked to the Serpentreach by Kronium Dwarf influence. Unlike them, we have no Kronium in Amldihr to keep us from our destiny. There is no High King in Amldihr to disunite our empire, to weaken our borders, or to doom all dwarvenkind.

Almost everything is different– tunnels have collapsed in one section, reopened in another, have been barricaded by an adventurer party here, are occupied by an orc camp there– but there are fundamental patterns of geology which remain consistent. We find our way through the tunnels.\n\nWe also find ghosts of our past. Families shout out in glee as they find what they claim to be an old family home, or a structure which once held a holy shrine, or an ancestor ghost still haunting the halls. Some dwarves, though, are more ambitious in what haunts them: and none are more ambitious than Simun Az-Modan. He claims to be the descendant of a Diamond family which ruled Verkal Skomdihr, a claim which does not quite make sense. Who are we, though, to deny him his vision?

Despite every expectation, Ovdal Lodhum still stands.\n\nWhere we have been continually hampered by greedy guilds and ignoble nobles, they claim to be bereft of civil conflict. Where we have closed our gates for six thousand years, they have remained open and free. Where we are dwarven, they have been ruled by– unbelievably– a human. Gerin Orcrend killed countless orcs in the depths of the Dwarovar, took a dwarven wife, then followed her back to Ovdal Lodhum and became their king. It seems that the Garnet Dwarves will accept anyone as their betrothed, as long as they are willing to kill enough monsters.\n\nIf that is the case: fine, so be it. We shall promise to destroy every orc we find, and to reforge an empire with Arg-Ôrdstun and Ovdal Lodhum ruling it all. Will this appease them, do you think?

They did not accept a marriage, nor subjugation, and so we had to march on their hold. We did not want to hurt them, but they forced us to fight. Now, they continue to rebel against us– to deny our love, our affection, our genuine desire to cooperate– but this, too, can be managed. We have thick skin, even in heartbreak.\n\nDespite everything, Ovdal Lodhum shall still be our favourite.

We sang songs to fortify our morale, we readied for the toughest fight of our lives, and we marched towards the Firetop Mountain.\n\nThe ruined, half-melted Gor Bûrad was all we needed to see to know the fate of the Basalt Dwarves.

They were masters of weaponry (we have so many half-remembered tales of their legendary “Flintlocks,” which we presume to be some type of cannon), of herbology, and of magic. Their hold was even protected by the Warding Gate, a rune-inscribed and gem-encrusted barrier which separated our plane from the Feywild. What went wrong?\n\nSomething broke the Warding Gate, but we know not what. We must therefore send our mages and Runecrafters to this reclaimed hold, and set them to the task of repairing it. Perhaps, if we can understand why Verkal Skomdihr fell, we can avoid its fate in the future; perhaps, if we understand why the Gate broke, we can ensure it never does so again.

Therefore, we cannot push east without re-establishing the Warding Gate.\n\nWith diamonds aplenty, and powerful Runecarvers, we know this can be accomplished. Diamonds are used both as spellcasting reagents and as foci, allowing our mages to tap into incredible sources of energy; in addition, diamond-tipped tools can chisel almost anything.

The gold was the reason Verkal Gulan was founded to begin with, and despite millennia of mining, the Delve still continues to quench our people’s all-consuming thirst for more and more gold. Any ruler, dwarven or otherwise, would seek to control its riches to fund their war machine.\n\nWith Seghdihr’s capitulation to our leadership, only Verkal Gulan remains of the survivors of the old Segbandal, and as we are the new heirs to the Segbandal, it is only right and just that Verkal Gulan also submit to Diamond rule.

Yet we must also avoid the same mistakes Aul-Dwarov made; we cannot allow our subjects too much autonomy over their rule, lest we become a house divided once more.\n\nThe Convocation of Elders is our solution. By integrating the elders of other holds of the Dwarovar into a subsidiary assembly to the Gleaming Council, we will achieve two things. Firstly, we will create a forum for other schools of thought than our own, which will broaden our understanding of matters outside of our traditional powerbase in the Serpentreach.

Each hold demanded respect, for they had earned it: after thousands of years of service to each other and themselves, we were rightfully afforded dominance over the Empire. As time went on, though, the High Kings demanded more obligations to the crown. They forgot who made Aul-Dwarov function, why it existed at all.

The entrance of Rubyhold into Aul-Dwarov permanently severed the bonds between the dwarves, and weakened us right before the fall. Only a return to the old ways could have saved us, but the War ended in an unstable peace. Within two thousand years, the elves would come, and then the orcs, and we were too disunited to fight them. All because of that gem - as red as the blood that was spilled for it."

This practice is ancient and beloved, but it holds a secret rarely-acknowledged by our people: it doesn’t actually work.\n\nWhen using Lightflare armour, we have to shine bright lights onto our men so that the armour’s gems can redirect that light. This mostly just blinds Diamond soldiers, though, as the light is facing them rather than any of their enemies. Our troops love glowing like divine fury, but Lightflare is just another one of our many traditional practices which we stubbornly hold to despite minimal benefit. We must reform it, as we have reformed the others.\n\nThankfully, we’ve found a way to satisfy our nobles (who insist that it is their ancestral right to wear Lightflare) and actually make the armour useful. We shall inscribe runes around the armour’s embedded diamonds, which can force the gems themselves to emit light in focused beams towards the wearer’s enemies.

Runes are incessantly carved into its walls, sapping as much energy as possible into nullifying wards; mages use all of their effort to conduct magic away from the study; and yet, despite it all, the Diamond of our crown continues to emit unknowable charms. Those who study it become baffled and bemused, and, if they can keep at their studies, fall into a stupor which lasts for hours or days. Our gem will not allow any scholar to witness it, to understand its interior, to comprehend how or why it operates. It repels all sight like a shield repels arrows. It acts like an Aegis of its name, but only as one that defends against our desperate, prying eyes.\n\nThere is some strange complexity to the Diamond’s internals. Light twists and turns inside it like it would in no true gem... its cut is too beautiful to be understood. We thought, from all the old stories, that the Aegis was perhaps too perfect to be real. These doubts were assuaged by finding it once more, but now we hesitate, for we know not whether we actually possess the gem that once forged the Dwarovkron. Was it always like this; were we always like this? What horrifying curses have kept its magic alive for all this time? How does it function, and what– oh, if only we knew– what does this diamond actually do?"

He treated his empire as a union of equals; kings of each hold retained their status, and nobles kept their rights in all realms of life. This political balance may have seemed reasonable at first, but it led to constant conflict: and we were a crucial instigator. As we spread through the Serpentreach, as Seghdihr monopolized the Middle Dwarovar, and as Grônstunad took the East, Amldihr could do nothing to stop us. We earned every intra-national conquest through blood, inheritance, veto, and privilege. When we became powerful enough, we launched the War of the Bloody Gem to become High Kings ourselves... and we nearly won. In truth, we only failed because we made the same mistakes our enemies had.\n\nFor the last six millenia, we have struggled under the weight of noble rights and privileges. Just as Aul-Dwarov did, we gave our elites the right to conflict, the right to petition, the right to fight us tooth and nail; and what has this earned us but bloodshed? We fought against Amldihr, just to fall to the very same structures which destroyed them. We, just as much as the Kronium Dwarves, doomed Aul-Dwarov: our ancestors doomed the dwarves. We shall not fall to this same mistake again.\n\nEver since the Second Diamond Queen opened our gates, we have imposed ourselves upon the Serpentreach, and the Middle Dwarovar, and Amldihr: and we respect our subject holds only as far as they bow towards us. Through conquest, not confederation, we have crafted ourselves into an unprecedented dwarven polity. We have made a centralized, powerful, unitary government, where our rulers dictate the will of the Serpentspine.\n\nTherefore, we are no longer just Arg-Ôrdstun, nor are we Aul-Dwarov: we are Szetur Ôrdstunov, the Gleaming Gem Home.

The final safekeeping of these vaults and their calamitous contents was once tasked to a veritable army of warded titanium golems, should the unthinkable occur and Gor Vazumbrog’s defences be tested and found wanting. From the appearance of the hold, however, the unthinkable occurred long ago.\n\nAfter clearing out the orc scum that squatted in the ruins of Gor Vazumbrog, a cursory examination of the place was carried out – and it quickly became apparent what had happened. The hold fell not through orcish savagery or goblin trickery, but from something far greater and much more dangerous: the appearance of a dragon in the lowest reaches of the hold. According to the handful of surviving Titanium records, the dragon exuded some sort of toxic miasma that drove anyone nearby completely mad, and many vaults were breached as the dragon attempted to make its way out. An evacuation was ordered, and the titanium golems sent to attack the dragon.\n\nThe dragon seems to have disappeared long ago, but the vile, pulsing gash in the earth – the Dragon’s Wound – remains, and there are those who see opportunity amidst the danger. The costs to outfit an expedition of this nature would be enormous, but what are they compared to this unprecedented chance to recover the artifacts cast off by our ancestors?"

Immediately, the magics that had leaked from the artifacts within the broken vaults began to take hold: the most common affliction the survivors reported was a feeling of growing madness (or perhaps paranoia) gnawing away at the back of their minds, seemingly at all times. Sleeping grew increasingly difficult, and soon, some expeditionaries – exhausted from lack of rest and addled by hallucinations – began to turn their steel on the others.\n\nAs the expedition reached the draconic miasma which had settled into the depths, the chaos grew stronger. One dwarf tells us that the hold’s fauna and flora had been mutated beyond all recognition; his companions recount the very darkness reaching out and snatching their comrades with talons of shadow and malice. Other survivors tell of their comrades turning to stone without rhyme or reason, their last desperate cries for help choking in their petrifying vocal cords, whilst another group, who unwisely stopped to refill their waterskins from a pool, were soon clutching at insides, heads, and throats, as some sort of parasite transformed them into little more than meat puppets. One survivor swears blind he briefly saw the dragon himself.\n\nThe handful of priceless artifacts the survivors were able to bring back from broken vaults as they took flight will be locked away for safekeeping.

It is clear that the Lapidaries aim to dominate not only gem-cutting, but also gem-mining, gem-trading, and gem-enchantment: in short, they aim to dominate all jewels, and through them our entire economy. \n\nWe can react to this development in two ways. First, we could allow the Lapidaries to expand, but only if they pay for it. If they are willing to compensate the state, and aid in general administration, they may buy or sell whatever they wish. This could lead to a great windfall in assets, which we dearly need.\n\nOn the other hand, we could force the Lapidaries to sell their shares to the state.

They have laid out a program which would give them perpetual control over the entire economy, from agriculture to mining to production to export. They are not allowing us to negotiate, or propose lesser terms: we have the option of conceding, or of fighting them. With the power we allowed them to amass over the decades, fighting them will not be easy.\n\nHow do we react to this revolt of guildsmen and lapidaries?

Yet with the long slow decline of the hold following the Diamond Decree, the gemcutters, too, have withered and shrunk to a shadow of their former selves, bickering and arguing over pointless matters like everybody else, and neglecting even the bare basics of their economic duties. Whilst the Guild remains in such a sorry state, the economy will doubtlessly continue to suffer, and their incompetence will cost us dearly in the decades to come."

The incompetent old guard, together with their inadequacies and mistakes, have been swept away, and the purge has allowed a wave of younger, more dynamic minds to come to the fore in the Guild, allowing it once again to become one of the most valued institutions in all the Dwarovar."
