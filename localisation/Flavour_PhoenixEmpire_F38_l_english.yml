 phoenix_empire_the_great_waterway_title:0 "The Great Waterway"
 phoenix_empire_the_great_waterway_desc:0 "The city of Bulwar stands as a testament to the might of Surael, and thanks to the canals within it linking the Suran to the Buranun, was once the greatest center of commerce in the entire empire. Over the years, however, the canals have fallen into disrepair, and Bulwar’s prominence has slowly faded. This cannot remain! The waterways will be repaired, and Bulwar shall once more be the crown jewel of the empire of Surael."
 phoenix_empire_the_golden_highway_title:0 "The Golden Highway"
 phoenix_empire_the_golden_highway_desc:0 "Slicing through the desert sands lies the greatest of the monuments to the might of Surael; the Golden Highway. Or at least, it did in days long past. Laid in the wake of Jaher in his eastward conquests, the highway has, like so many other monuments of the old empire, fallen into disrepair.\n\nIf we are to once more project power from Yanshen to the Divenhal, we must be able to transport goods and soldiers between west and east with speed and ease, as Jaher did in those days long past. As such, the Golden Highway must be repaired; it is the will of Surael."
 phoenix_empire_secure_bahar_title:0 "Secure Bahar"
 phoenix_empire_secure_bahar_desc:0 "Bahar, the gateway between Bulwar and Cannor, has always been fiercely independent. These delusions of notions are, of course, delusional. The light of Surael shall be brought to the westernmost lands of Bulwar, and from Bahar, the march westward, to the conquests of Jexis, can begin."
 phoenix_empire_the_busilari_protectorate_title:0 "The Busilari Protectorate"
 phoenix_empire_the_busilari_protectorate_desc:0 "Businor, the realm of lions, was the sight of our first liberation, as Jaher freed the realm from the Castanorian yoke, and in one of the greatest tragedies of our ancestors, due to our lack of enlightenment, we did not even attempt to spread to Businor the light of Surael.\n\nThese lands, dominated by the kingdoms of Busilar and Eborthíl, are now of vital strategic importance. In the south of the region, the Isle of Tef serves as the beating heart of the Divenhali trade, whilst in the north, Busilar, with its protection behind the mighty Khenak Range, serves as an ideal staging point for the invasion of mighty Anbennar."
 phoenix_empire_link_up_title:0 "Link Up"
 phoenix_empire_link_up_desc:0 "With the continuing of our conquests in Cannor, the fact is that should any power challenge our naval dominance of the Divenhal, the Busilari Protectorate could easily fall out of our grasp. As such, our conquests in the west must be connected, and the Empire of Anbennar, divided and disunited by their foolish conflicts over false gods, serves as a weak and easy target.\n\nFor their own good, the light of Surael shall be brought to the Borders. The liberation of Anbennar has begun."
 phoenix_empire_jexis_conquest_title:0 "Jexis' Conquest"
 phoenix_empire_jexis_conquest_desc:0 "Hundreds of years ago, Jexis, daughter of Jaher, brought the light of Surael all the way to the isle of Damesear. We must recreate this conquest, for these lands have forsaken the light of Surael, in favour of their false Regent Court. The westerners’ petty dispute between their silly notions of these so-called gods of "Corin" and "Adean" shall be settled once and for all; there is no god but Surael."
 phoenix_empire_around_the_dameshead_title:0 "Around the Dameshead"
 phoenix_empire_around_the_dameshead_desc:0 "The Dameshead, at the center of Cannor, serves as one of, if not the greatest centers of commerce in the known world. Through control of this mighty inland sea, and the riches of the merchant-cities that surround it, we shall secure for ourselves a near-endless source of income, for despite our faith in Surael, our legions do not march on faith alone. With supremacy on both land and sea, the Dameshead shall fall before the might of the Phoenix."
 phoenix_empire_one_empire_title:0 "One Empire"
 phoenix_empire_one_empire_desc:0 "Since its founding, the Empire of Anbennar has been weak and divided. With near-constant infighting and conflict, despite its vast riches, Anbennar has not once in its history been truly united. Until now, that is. For now that the Phoenix Banner flies from Wesdam to Arannen, from Vertesk to Verne, all the peoples of Anbennar stand united through the might of the Phoenix, and the truth of Surael."
 phoenix_empire_lords_of_grapes_and_grain_title:0 "Land of Grape and Grain"
 phoenix_empire_lords_of_grapes_and_grain_desc:0 "In the far west of Cannor lies Lencenor, home of the Lorentish, and adopted land of the halflings. These lands are some of the most fertile in the world by far, and produce more grain and wine than even Bulwar itself. By conquering these lands, we shall secure ourselves against any famines we may face in the centuries to come; the followers of Surael need not ever go hungry again, for the grain of Lencenor shall flow forth to all!"
 phoenix_empire_to_the_sunset_title:0 "To the Sunset"
 phoenix_empire_to_the_sunset_desc:0 "The Dragon Coast, westernmost of all of the realms of Cannor, has fallen to Surael’s legions. All of the west now stands before us, the Phoenix banner replacing that of Anbennar, Lorent, Dameria, and any other realm that would challenge our rule over Cannor. We have reached the ocean. Our legions must merely sweep up the remnants. For we have reached the land of the sunset."
 phoenix_empire_cloudless_cannor_title:0 "Cloudless Cannor"
 phoenix_empire_cloudless_cannor_desc:0 "From Lorentainé to Gaweton, from Oddansbay to Eborthíl, across Lencenor, Small Country, the Dameshead, Gawed, and countless other lands, the light has held strong, and banished the darkness. A new day dawns in Cannor, and there is not a cloud in the deep blue sky."
 phoenix_empire_the_east_west_trade_title:0 "The East West Trade"
 phoenix_empire_the_east_west_trade_desc:0 "From Anbennar to Rahen; from Yanshen to Kheterata; the merchants of the Phoenix Empire dominate the world’s trade. Endless goods flow between east and west, and the Golden Highway is filled to the brim with endless goods, and the Divenhal and Gulf of Rahen alike are awash with our ships. Untold wealth flows throughout our lands every day, and only seems to grow larger. Surael must truly smile upon us, for as our lands stretch from west to east, His light never truly sets upon the Phoenix Empire."
 phoenix_empire_the_corvurian_protectorate_title:0 "The Corvurian Protectorate"
 phoenix_empire_the_corvurian_protectorate_desc:0 "Once home to the mighty kingdom of Dostanor, freed from Castanor by our forces so many centuries ago, Corvuria, and the lands around it, have long since fallen to ruin, decay, and corruption of the worst possible kind. Divided and squabbling, the realms of Dostanor should be easy to conquer, and they are of vital importance, for despite its largely flooded nature, the region nonetheless serves as one of the great crossroads between Bulwar, Cannor, and Escann.\n\nStrategic importance aside, however, given the rumours that have spread of the unholy nature of Corvuria’s nobility, those deathless undead creatures whomst live only in darkness, if there is anywhere that Surael’s light is needed, it is here."
 phoenix_empire_the_shining_blade_title:0 "The Shining Blade"
 phoenix_empire_the_shining_blade_desc:0 "The lands we fought so hard to liberate in the war of the Sorcerer-King have, it seems, been devastated once more by an endless tide of orcs. The southern lands of former Castanor, divided and devastated as they may be, contain one item of vital importance; Calindal, the Gleaming Blade.\n\nThis weapon, blade of fire, slayer of dragons, is surely yet another manifestation of the might of Surael. We shall scour this land far and wide, so that the Shining Blade shall be held by its true ruler: the Phoenix King."
 phoenix_empire_no_more_witch_kings_title:0 "No More Witch-Kings"
 phoenix_empire_no_more_witch_kings_desc:0 "In the lands of Escann, realm of adventurer-kings and orcish tribes, magic has been allowed to reign unrestricted, with the mages of these lands performing unholy acts that violate all that is right and just in the world, and therefore must surely be against the will of Surael. These lands must be conquered, and the Witch-Kings defeated once and for all."
 phoenix_empire_outshine_the_moon_title:0 "Outshine the Moon"
 phoenix_empire_outshine_the_moon_desc:0 "As our conquest of Cannor continues, we have encountered many of our lost brethren, but so many have corrupted themselves, intermarrying and sullying themselves with the humans of the west. It is with great pleasure then, that our legions encounter the Elfrealm of Ibevar. Although these elves have turned to the false gods of the west, to convince them of the truth of Surael will surely be easy. They shall therefore learn the most important lesson of all; the moon can never outshine the sun."
 phoenix_empire_the_length_of_the_divenhal_title:0 "The Length of the Divenhal"
 phoenix_empire_the_length_of_the_divenhal_desc:0 "To our west, at the north-eastern tip of Akasik, beyond the sands of the Salahad, lies Akasik, an oasis of plains and hills guarded from the harsh desert by the mighty Akasik mountain range, for which the region is named. Home to gnollish pirates, a constant thorn in our side, as well as several budding Cannorian colonies, it is of vital importance that we take this land: both to establish supply lines across the Divenhal and into Cannor, and also to prove our dominion over the entirety of northern Sarhal, and thus, the Divenhal itself."
 phoenix_empire_capital_of_the_west_title:0 "Capital of the West"
 phoenix_empire_capital_of_the_west_desc:0 "With the continuing of our conquests in Cannor, it becomes more and more clear by the day that these lands simply cannot be governed effectively from distant Bulwar. As Jexis did before us, then, we shall convert the mightiest of the western cities, Anbenncóst, into a center of administration not just for the former lands of Anbennar, but all of our western conquests. Under Surael’s light, Anbenncóst shall rival even the mighty metropolises of Bulwar; a capital of the west."
 phoenix_empire_westward_missions_title:0 "Westward Missions"
 phoenix_empire_westward_missions_desc:0 "To the west, beyond the Divenhal, lies Cannor, home to wayward men and elves, still worshiping their dead gods; in fact, in their foolishness, they fight each other over which of their gods are or are not dead! We shall put an end to this foolishness, showing that all gods are dead; all besides Surael."
 phoenix_empire_effulgent_escann_title:0 "Effulgent Escann"
 phoenix_empire_effulgent_escann_desc:0 "Across Escann, home of ancient Castanor, one of the only realms of men truly capable of rivaling the might of the Phoenix Empire, there was mere centuries great devastation, the Greentide, followed by a time of rebuilding. Yet from this hardship, grew only a harsher land; the enduring worship of false gods, the widespread practice of slavery, and the rise of the witch-kings.\n\nNow, however, Escann has been saved from its sin. Under the glorious light of the Phoenix Empire, its people are liberated, no longer orc, human, or goblin, but loyal servants of Surael. A new day dawns in Escann, and with it both the sun and the people of Escann shine forth, effulgent."
 phoenix_empire_revive_the_phoenix_title:0 "Revive the Phoenix"
 phoenix_empire_revive_the_phoenix_desc:0 "For centuries, Bulwar has been shattered. The empire of Jaher divided amongst countless squabbling Kingdoms, looted by gnolls, goblins, harpies, and countless other monsters, not to mention the heretical Jadd. All these foes, and countless others, have been vanquished. Jaher’s legacy has been restored, and the Phoenix Empire, guided by Surael’s light, stands ascendant over Bulwar once more."
 phoenix_empire_ignite_the_phoenix_title:0 "Ignite the Phoenix"
 phoenix_empire_ignite_the_phoenix_desc:0 "As the Phoenix Empire spreads, as it has done so in the centuries before, so too does the light of Surael. Countless lands have been saved from the dark by our endless legions, and yet, despite the strength of our faith, all these lands simply cannot be held by one central government. Instead, we shall do as Jaher and Jexis did before us, and allow the newly conquered lands to retain their previous administrations, though ensuring that said administrations answer directly to the emperor. In doing so, we shall ensure their loyalty in the conquests to come, whilst slowly but surely integrating them further into the more centralized parts of our empire."
 phoenix_empire_don_the_phoenix_crown_title:0 "Don the Phoenix Crown"
 phoenix_empire_don_the_phoenix_crown_desc:0 "A glorious crown of gleaming gold, the Phoenix Crown is an artifact nearly as old as the Phoenix Empire itself. First worn by the mighty Jaher, first true emissary of Surael, forged at his behest, and then by the mighty Jexis, the Burned Empress, after her passing, the crown has sat unused, an object of worship rather than a crown in and of itself, for no ruler since Jexis’ death has felt themselves worthy enough to claim it.\n\nWe, however, have proven ourselves worthy, for our Emperor has proven themselves a worthy successor to their legacy. In the name of Jaher, Jexis, and Surael, the Phoenix Crown shall be donned once more!"
 phoenix_empire_a_grand_celebration_title:0 "A Grand Celebration"
 phoenix_empire_a_grand_celebration_desc:0 "The palace, in all its glory, has been completed! The pinnacle of luxury and imperial power, the mighty building now stands as one of the many jewels in the Phoenix Crown. In order to celebrate this feat, let us hold a grand jubilee, inviting all in the empire of any level of notoriety.\n\nThe nobility, of course, shall attend, along with those esteemed representatives of Surael, the clergy, but in addition, local rulers, foreign dignitaries, mighty mages, renowned adventurers, and even influential commoners shall be invited to attend the celebrations!"
 phoenix_empire_secure_bulwar_title:0 "Secure Bulwar"
 phoenix_empire_secure_bulwar_desc:0 "Bulwar, core of the empire, seat of our power, and the flaming torch which shall bring the light of Surael to every corner of the world. Between the mighty rivers Suran and Buranun, lie shining cities the envy of all across the world, from mighty Brasan to shining Sarayend, splendid Azkabar, to the city of Bulwar itself, center of the world. If we are to build our empire, and hold any legitimacy as the true heirs to the Phoenix Empire, we must ensure that all of these lands lie safely under our control."
 phoenix_empire_jahers_inheritance_title:0 "Jaher's Inheritance"
 phoenix_empire_jahers_inheritance_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the wise Khetarch Baqkhet, rather than fighting the resplendent realm of Surael, chose instead to gift the eastern part of his realm to the glorious and noble Jaher. Our empire, though rightfully the sovereign of these lands, must properly establish imperial rule over the lands of the Khet, which will surely be easily, given the constant squabbles and wars between the gnolls, men, and misguided elves that call the lands of the Khet their home."
 phoenix_empire_push_south_title:0 "Push South"
 phoenix_empire_push_south_desc:0 "Even further south, beyond the sands of the mighty Salahad, lies the rest of Sarhal, a lush, if dangerous land. If we are to secure our holdings north of the desert, truly, we must therefore secure the lands south of it; the first step in this endeavor shall be to truly crush the so-called empire that the gnolls have built themselves, this "Gnollakaz."\n\nOnce this task has been accomplished, not only will our holdings in Bulwar and Kheterata be ever more secure, but the way shall lie open for expansion into the rest of the great southern continent."

 phoenix_empire_bright_bulwar_desc:0 "If we are to truly call ourselves heirs to Surael, bringers of light, spreaders of truth, then we must first ensure that all of us truly believe. The light shall be brought to every corner, and any semblance of heresy, from the Hunt, Xhazobkult, or worst of all, the heretics of the Jadd, shall be eliminated.\n\nOnly then, once Bulwar is truly bright, can Surael’s light begin to engulf the world"

 phoenix_empire_crossing_the_kharunyana_title:0 "Crossing the Kharunyana"
 phoenix_empire_crossing_the_kharunyana_desc:0 "The Kharunyana is truly a glorious river, perhaps even to rival the Suran or the Sorrow. It has, for millennia, acted as a natural boundary, dividing the proud Raheni from the ancient Bom peoples. Yet, what is a river to an empire? Who are we to let simple water define how far the light may spread? The Kharunyana shall be crossed by our armies, and it shall be crossed by our priests, and it shall be crossed countless times more. For like the Suran, like the Sorrow, like every other river upon Halann, the Kharunyana consists of water. And what does water do, if not reflect the light?"
 phoenix_empire_where_jaher_failed_title:0 "Where Jaher Failed"
 phoenix_empire_where_jaher_failed_desc:0 "The Kai peoples are proud, and, in all fairness, not undeservingly so. Where all the rest of Haless fell to Jaher’s legions, it was the Kai that remained resolute. Though Jaher would surely have conquered them had he not been brought to an untimely end by the traitorous eunuchs of Yanshen, the fact they held as long as they did would be worthy of praise. Would, that is, had their so-called accomplishment not been the denial of Surael, the denial of truth, the denial of Light. Their denial, then, shall continue no further. Their townships will fall. Their deserts will be pierced. If necessary, their jungles will be burned. In the end, the Kai will see the Light."
 phoenix_empire_long_lost_brothers_title:0 "Long Lost Brothers"
 phoenix_empire_long_lost_brothers_desc:0 "At the fall of Jaeral’s Sunrise Empire, all of Haless, in their misguided rejection of the Light, turned on the legions of old, forcing the remains of the Empire’s forces into retreat. Many of these elves made it westward, returning to Bulwar. Others, however, went south, to Arawkelin, the port city founded by Jaher so long ago. Though many differences have grown over our hundreds of years of separation, not least of which their seeming contentment with leaving the humans of their realm to rule themselves, they are our brothers nonetheless."
 phoenix_empire_make_the_oni_bow_title:0 "Make the Oni Bow"
 phoenix_empire_make_the_oni_bow_desc:0 "The Demon Hills are accurately named. It is here, among towering peaks and clouded valleys, that the Oni have made their home. They are not, like so many others in Haless, misguided, without the Light to guide them. Instead, they are, by their own admissions, creatures of the Dark, openly practicing the arts of shadow-magic. Their monasteries of Darkness shall be destroyed, their fog dismissed, and the arrogant Oni shall bow before us."
 phoenix_empire_old_gold_title:0 "Old Gold"
 phoenix_empire_old_gold_desc:0 ""
 phoenix_empire_eastward_missions_title:0 "Eastward Missions"
 phoenix_empire_eastward_missions_desc:0 "In the east, the lands of Haless, despite the attempts of Jaher a thousand years ago, cut so cruelly short, the light of Surael has, for the most part, failed to take hold. The faiths of these lands, the heathens of their high and mighty "High Philosophy" and "Righteous Path," must be annihilated, to be replaced by the glorious light of Surael."
 phoenix_empire_radiant_rahen_title:0 "Radiant Rahen"
 phoenix_empire_radiant_rahen_desc:0 "Throughout Rahen, a land witness to so much wealth, and yet so much war, witness to countless faiths and countless philosophies, so many misguided, so many false, so many in service of the darkness, the light of Surael has finally triumphed. Across its many cities, its deserts, plains and jungles; human, harimari, and hobgoblin alike now stand united in their faith in the sun; their faith in the light. A new day dawns in Rahen, and both the sun and the future appear radiant."
 phoenix_empire_secure_the_east_title:0 "Secure the East"
 phoenix_empire_secure_the_east_desc:0 "In the east, at the fringes of the empire, lies the eastern Salahad, a wild land, home to harpies, gnolls, and the egregious pretenders to Surael’s who refer to themselves as "The Jadd." We must rescue this land from itself, and bring it under the watchful eye of the empire, so that it shall not fall once more to heresy. In doing so, we can establish a link to Rahen, and by extension all of Haless, setting the stage for the conquests to come."
 phoenix_empire_the_ruin_of_the_raj_title:0 "The Ruin of the Raj"
 phoenix_empire_the_ruin_of_the_raj_desc:0 "Beyond the Salahad, beyond the imposing heights of the Paravimvata, lies Rahen, a land of riches to rival Bulwar itself. Dominated by the Raj, it is a decadent realm, one which shall prove easy enough to destroy. As Jaher before us destroyed the Raj of old, we shall destroy its successor, and bring Rahen, and eventually all of Haless, into the glorious light of Surael!"
 phoenix_empire_taking_the_porcelain_cities_title:0 "Taking the Porcelain Cities"
 phoenix_empire_taking_the_porcelain_cities_desc:0 "At the eastern frontier, along the mighty Kharunyana, lie the rich and bountiful Porcelain Cities. Within these mighty fortress-cities lie the secrets of creating porcelain, one of the most valued ceramics in the world. By taking these mighty cities, bringing them into the wider fold of the Phoenix Empire, we can use these techniques not only for profit, and these cities not only to further cement our hold over trade, but both to further the light and glory of Surael."
 phoenix_empire_visiting_the_oracle_title:0 "Visiting the Oracle"
 phoenix_empire_visiting_the_oracle_desc:0 "Though there are many temples across Haless, profane in their veneration of their so-called ‘High Gods’, there is one among them that is, seemingly, of actual value. Atop Mount Tughayasa lies the Oracular Order, an ancient group of monks who apparently have pierced the veil of time. Should this be true, then surely they have seen the inevitability of the Empire’s triumph? Surely they see the coming glory of the Light? Regardless, whether their claims be true or not, the mere possibility of the former means that they must at least be consulted."
 phoenix_empire_the_cradle_of_the_east_title:0 "The Cradle of the East"
 phoenix_empire_the_cradle_of_the_east_desc:0 "Northern Rahen is a land defined by its history, perhaps just as much as Bulwar. It was here that the first Raheni city-states rose, here that Rahen’s great libraries were first built, and here where the first High Kings of Rahen were crowned. It was here, too, that like so much of Haless fell in Harimar’s conquests, and here which fell first to the hobgoblin Command. So, therefore, it shares much similarity to Bulwar; a land of once prosperous kingdoms, assailed on all sides by enemies and conquerors. Unlike Bulwar, however, the Ruin Kingdoms did not have Surael to guide them, and did not have the Sun Elves to save them. This must, and shall, be rectified."
 phoenix_empire_the_forest_of_monks_title:0 "The Forest of Monks"
 phoenix_empire_the_forest_of_monks_desc:0 "It seems, in the wake of the old conquests, the lands of the Xianjie have forged their Xiaken, temple-fortresses of warrior monks. Where the legions of old swept through the hills and onward to Yanshen, now, we face stiff resistance, as it seems every temple is a fortress in its own right, every hilltop a bastion which must be fought for tooth and nail. Yet, there are only so many monks, and there is only so much martial arts can do against steel and spear reinforced by faith. One day, then, these temples shall be rededicated, not to warfare, or their misinformed Paths, but to the worship of Surael."
 phoenix_empire_avenge_jaher_title:0 "Avenge Jaher"
 phoenix_empire_avenge_jaher_desc:0 "It was in Yanshen that it happened. The horrid. The unthinkable. The sacrilegious. The assassination of Jaher. Jaher, freer of Bulwar. Jaher, liberator of Rahen. Jaher, Surael Incarnate. Brought low by the treacherous blades of the eunuchs of Yanshen. Well, no more! No more shall the Yan tell of their so-called victory over the Empire, the untimely end of the victory of Light in the east. We shall see to it, such that never again shall Surael’s will be defied by Yan treachery, and never again shall elven blood be drawn by eunuch blades."
 phoenix_empire_to_the_sunrise_title:0 "To the Sunrise"
 phoenix_empire_to_the_sunrise_desc:0 "Along the Yanhe, the metropoli of Yanshen stand resplendent. Along the river's flow lies the final stretch of the Golden Highway, finally linking distant Brasan, upon the mighty Divenhal, all the way to the Ocean of the Lost, and Tianlou. With the subcontinent’s conquest, the light of Surael can now truly be said to spread from sea to shining sea!"
 phoenix_empire_heliophilous_haless_title:0 "Heliophilous Haless"
 phoenix_empire_heliophilous_haless_desc:0 "Haless, for as long as its history has been recorded, has been a land of questions. Questions asked by its people. Questions of the right path of life, of the origins of their HIgh Temples, of the nature of their spirits. Questions of the nature of their so-called gods, questions of the fate of empires and emperors, and questions of what shall succeed them. Well, now, under our guidance, these questions are answered, and all are answered as one; there is no god but Surael, and Light shall triumph over Darkness. A new day dawns in Haless, and its people and their search for truth with the embrace of Light, heliophilous."
 phoenix_empire_expanding_the_farmlands_title:0 "Expanding the Farmlands"
 phoenix_empire_expanding_the_farmlands_desc:0 "Between the Suran and Barunan, Surael’s people prosper. The riverlands readily provide some of the most fertile lands in all Halann, bringing lush greenery to what would have otherwise been yet more of the vast Salahad. Yet, as Surael’s empire grows, it cannot be helped but to notice that the supply of arable land is comparatively limited. Only so many new farms can be constructed before floodplains give way to the barren mountains and deserts which act as Bulwar’s shield. As such, what land is available shall be exploited, overturned, and made all the more efficient with modern irrigation techniques, foreign crops, and of course, the labour of the servants of Surael. For though Surael’s rays allow for life to grow, it is only through the efforts of His followers that life is able to flourish."
 phoenix_empire_growth_of_the_bulwari_cities_title:0 "Growth of the Bulwari Cities"
 phoenix_empire_growth_of_the_bulwari_cities_desc:0 "Throughout the lands of Bulwar lie countless urban centres, each with a storied history of their own, dating back millennia. Following the dissolution of Jexis’ empire, many of them would serve as bases of power for the various kingdoms who went on to squabble over the Bulwari heartland. In this squabbling and division, however, many of Bulwar’s cities grew stagnant, falling behind their Cannorian and Halessi counterparts. Now that Bulwar is united once more under the banner of the Phoenix, and the Light of Surael, the cities of Bulwar must be revitalised once more. For one cannot spread Light whilst in the shadows of others, and thus the Bulwari cities must grow to become beacons that shall bathe the world in Light."
 phoenix_empire_bulwar_renaissance_title:0 "Bulwar Renaissance"
 phoenix_empire_bulwar_renaissance_desc:0 "Cannor, in days gone by, saw itself reborn in the image of its old empires, of Castanor and Dameria, in the process rediscovering traditions and arts which had long since fallen into relative obscurity. Many of these traditions have, over time, made their way into Bulwar, spread by the merchants who ply their trade across the Divenhal.\n\nYet, who are we, servants of Surael, to play second fiddle to the Cannorians, who refuse to acknowledge the true faith? Bulwar does not learn, it teaches. It does not follow, it leads. Cannor has been reborn once. The phoenix has been reborn time and time again. Let the Cannorians be proud of their so-called renaissance, for the Bulwari have had far too many renaissances to count. What’s one more?"
 phoenix_empire_a_crossroads_of_ideas_title:0 "A Crossroads of Ideas"
 phoenix_empire_a_crossroads_of_ideas_desc:0 "From the mercantile cities of Anbennar to the eunuch republics of Yanshen. From the Porcelain Cities upon the Kharunyana to the Kheteratan Metropoli upon the Mother’s Sorrow. All desire the wares of the others, and with the revitalisation of the Golden Highway, all find themselves travelling between each other through the heart of the Phoenix Empire. With the movement of these merchants, however, comes more than goods. Scholars, books, and ideas travel just as fast along the Golden Highway as the merchant’s caravan. So it is that almost every new idea in the world, every concept, every discovery, shall find itself passing at some point or another through the lands of Bulwar."
 phoenix_empire_heliocentric_halann_title:0 "Heliocentric Halann"
 phoenix_empire_heliocentric_halann_desc:0 "Just as Halann finds itself travelling around the holy sun, so too do the rest of the world’s nations find themselves orbiting the radiant might of the Phoenix Empire. Across every corner of the world, from Cannor to Haless to Sarhal, and across distant Aelantir and Insyaa, no realm can even dream of rivaling Surael’s domain.\n\nForeign rulers who would style themselves kings, or even emperors, all kneel when in the audience of the Phoenix emperor, and count themselves lucky to do so. For they kneel as rulers of independent realms, rather than as vassals.\n\nA meaningless distinction."

 phoenix_empire.1.t:0 "Victory in Anbenncóst"
 phoenix_empire.1.d:0 "I stand here, resplendent in victory, ahead of my victorious armies and surrounded by a meager hundred bodyguards, in the old capital of Jexis, city of the world’s desire, lost jewel of the Phoenix Empire; Anbenncóst. Truly deserving of its reputation, even in its ruined state, the city is large enough to surpass even Bulwar itself.\n\nYet, as I look beyond the city, and at its people, I see something yet more fascinating. From all over Halann, people have gathered in this city; elves, humans, orcs, trolls, goblins, halflings, dwarves, gnomes, harimari, and countless others. Not only living in the same city; but truly living together. I see a gnome and a kobold share a drink outside of their shared workshop, an orc and a dwarf stumbling home drunk after a night of drinking, and a human and halfling tightly grasping one another's hands.\n\nTruly, it is a thing of beauty, and something I one day wish to see in every city of my empire.\n\nOf course, there are issues to be resolved here; the people still must regard elves as their superiors, and have yet to accept Surael as the one true god, but nonetheless, it is admirable."

Though somewhat fitting that it should be named for a dead god weeping, keeping the name would nonetheless be a poor choice. A new name is required for this sea, one that reflects the might of the phoenix, the glory of Surael, who now lays dominion over it just as they lay dominion over the land it meets at the coast."

If Castanor could fall so easily, never to recover, who is to say that the same events could not happen to mine? Who is it to say that my empire could not fall like so many before; that I should be remembered as the last Phoenix-King?\n\nOf course, this idea is preposterous; for there is one thing which differentiates Castanor, and every other empire, from that of the Phoenix. Where they placed their hope in false, dead gods, my rule is mandated through the divine light of Surael. With the might of the one true god, even should my realm fall, as per its namesake, it shall rise, again and again.

What more could have been done, how much more could have been accomplished, how many lives could have been saved, had they simply not fallen to misguidance? Yet, what is in the past is in the past, and cannot be changed.\n\nAs I ponder this, I spot something out of the corner of my eye. An Ibevari child, at a mere 16 years of age, kneels upon the cobbled streets. A great gash has been cut through their side, blood pooling beside them on the pavement. In that moment, I do not see an enemy, or even a misguided ally; all I see is my brother, for we are all children of Surael, crying out in pain.\n\nClearly, the wound is fatal, in seconds they will be dead.\n\nIn that moment, there is but one thing I can do."

It is, therefore, of vital importance that we bring these realms under the sway of the Phoenix Empire, to prevent them from leaving Surael’s embrace. The first step shall be the establishment of an exclave on the continent, to serve as a staging ground for any future expeditions.

If memory serves, this theatre, the Phoenix’s Wing, was once known as the Moonsong Theatre, but of course, that name was certainly not one that could be kept.\n\nAs the performance continues, I begin to notice the subtle similarities and differences to the Bulwari theatre that I have spent most of my life watching; like back in Brasan, the Anbenncóster actors engage in dance to music being played by the band, but distinctly unlike back home, the actors join in on the music itself, singing, not just adjacent to the story they wish to tell, but as a part of it. The actors do not simply talk to each other, but address each other through song, bringing to bear a level of emotion rarely seen back home.\n\nThere are other differences too; for where back in the theatres of Brasan, and across the lands of Bulwar, the stories told are deadly serious, of noble heroes, terrible tragedies, and the might of Surael made manifest, here, they bring in lighter elements, humour, comedy. And as the actor playing Hoiasmo, a halfling serving primarily as comedic relief, trips over themselves in the middle of their own musical number, I come to a conclusion."

The warm morning sun radiates off of his skin, and the cattle seem especially docile. Even the angriest of the bulls stands content, munching on the hillside grass.\n\nThe orc looks out beyond the hillside, and sees countless farms, tended by countless people of countless peoples; his fellow orcs, true, but also humans, halflings, half-orcs, and even a dwarvern family just across the stream. The orc holds no animosity towards these people, and cannot understand such a thing occurring in the past; after all, are they not all servants of Surael?\n\nHe thinks excitedly of the coming summer solstice, and joining Durim, his dwarvern friend, for a round of Dwarovar Dark."

They sing my praises, talk of my glories, and then ask me for handouts. Thus, I decide to, at least temporarily take my leave, exiting one of the dozens of ballrooms, to stand before the gardens, and watch the setting sun.\n\nIt is then, seeming to confuse me for some sort of minor noble, I am met by a human woman, clearly by her garments one of my dozens of gardeners, who offers me a glass of wine.I think, in that moment, to tell her who I am, but eventually decide against it.

Yet, as I sit before them, I am nonetheless impressed; that so far from home, so long away, they have forged a life for themselves. If not as rulers, then as merchants, as tradesmen, as even preachers, spreading what little of Surael’s truth as they could.\n\nAnd, as I took a bite of, frankly, some of the most delicious curry I have yet tasted, I am reminded of the looks on the faces of legionnaires, both Bulwari and Halessi, as they saw the faces of cousins they never knew they had, of families, so long divided, united once more.\n\nI think, as I look at the elves sitting before me, that perhaps, our differences matter little, when we yet have so much in common."

So, I continue, up countless steps, one foot in front of the other, one step at a time.\n\nThis path was once beautiful, I can tell, but it is pockmarked now by craters and rubble, the remnants of the years-long siege. Throughout my ascent, I have seen gardens and rest-stops in various states of disrepair. Some are simply abandoned, others are little more than rubble. As I continue my climb, however, I see before me my destination; the High Temple itself, pockmarked by canonfire, yet nonetheless an impressive sight.\n\nBefore its gates are the remaining members of the Prophecy Guard. Like much of Tughayasa, they might once have been resplendent, but now, they are just as damaged as the temple they guard, their armour battered and their faces scarred and tired. At my approach, they bow as one. I can see the sweat on their faces. For the first time, I notice that, despite how winding the approach has been, circling around the mountain countless times, I now enter from the east. The morning sun rises behind me, the beams of Surael’s light pushing me onwards. How appropriate.\n\nAs the gates are opened by what I can only assume to be junior members of the Oracular Order, I am greeted by the sight of none other than the High Augar himself. He stands in the middle of his gardens, his body wrapped in a purple robe, and indeed he stands only with the support of an aged cane. Though his body is old and frail, unlike his guards, I can see in his eyes no sign of fear.\n\nIt is, I am told, traditional to bow, when one meets the High Augar. I remain standing. So does he.

He remembered the stories, told second or third hand, of endless golden legions, marching in an unstoppable advance, conquering realm after realm. Of merchants getting more and more desperate, afraid of the one they called a Ruler of Phoenixes, who did not age, would not be defeated, and could not be killed.\n\nYet, compared to a decade ago, the story is different. The Halessi now tell the Treasure Fleet of benevolence, of enlightenment, literally. Unification under the sun, which they now refer to as "Saral", or something like that.\n\nThe human merchant is skeptical, but then, he sees a figure step off one of the boats that make up the fleet, clearly a passenger from far off lands, as they seem neither Yan nor Triunic. A figure that, though at first glance may appear human, walks with a seemingly impossible air of arrogance, and has pointed ears upon their head.

Still extravagant, the palace shall be constructed in the traditional Bulwari style, home to sweeping arches and high towers. It shall be larger than all other palaces in Bulwar, but it shall not dwarf them.\n\nThe second design is more ambitious; and thus more expensive.

This proposal would see the construction of a large, cylindrical central building, standing over 6 stories tall and well over 100 meters wide, with its flat roof playing host to various gardens raised above it.

Constructed of brass, glass, and silver, this dome would be designed in such a way as that when the sun lies directly overhead, at midday each day, Surael’s rays shall shine through the various glass windows of the dome, into countless mirrors built within the room below, so as to create an image of Surael, standing resplendent in the centre of the room, and comprised of pure Sunlight.\n\nThe second feature would involve the walls of the palace. Were this option to be pursued, it would see them plated with various precious materials, from Halessi porcelain and silk, to dwarvern mithril and steel, to wood of the deepwoods itself. That is, of course, not to mention widespread use of gold, marble, and damestear, as well as the inclusion of various precious gems, from diamonds to rubies to emeralds, inlaid in the walls throughout the palace.\n\nThe third and final option would see the windows of the palace be replaced with those of stained glass, built in intricate detail so that, were one to walk in a specific route throughout the palace, they would see all the events of Bulwari history laid out for them, displayed in the windows in chronological order.

The frailty and intricate elegance of traditional elven carving, mixed with the bold and sweeping designs of Bulwari construction make for at once beautiful and imposing furnishing. More importantly, by using this style exclusively, an important message is sent; the Phoenix Empire is an empire of elves and Bulwari.

A vast, artificial wilderness filled to the brim with game ready for the Emperor to put their archery skills to use. A chaotic construction of trees, thickets, bushes, and creeks, all designed to provide the most enjoyable hunting experience.\n\nSecond, a paradise, plain and simple. The finest and most colourful flowers that can be imported, grass as soft to the touch as a pillow, trees which, through careful use of magic, provide bountiful fruit year-round, and water so crystal-clear within ponds that it appears almost ethereal.

 phoenixPalaceSizeNormal:0 "and stand before my new home, the palace, though simply of traditional Bulwari style, nonetheless outshining all others of its kind in the Empire."
 phoenixPalaceSizeLarge:0 "and stand before the three palaces that are to be my new home, the bridges and see the corridors between them already bustling with servants rushing to and fro."
 phoenixPalaceSizeMassive:0 "and stand before what is less a palace, and more a monument, a small city in its own right, a vast sun built into the landscape, to reflect upon the glory of Surael."
 phoenixPalaceWingLibrary:0 " An entrance to the new royal library, already filled with enough knowledge that one could spend even an elven lifetime within it, without reading all it has to offer."
 phoenixPalaceWingBallroom:0 " The vast imperial ballroom, one of the largest rooms in the palace, designed to accommodate thousands of guests simultaneously."
 phoenixPalaceWingLaboratories:0 " A few of the new royal laboratories, already bustling with royal researchers nearly tripping over themselves in a rush to meet with their respective colleagues."

 phoenixPalaceWingTemple:0 " The palace temple, a section of the palace dedicated not to glory, or function, but to something far more important, the recognition of the might of Surael. As I pass, I make sure to whisper a prayer myself, and briefly bow in recognition of Surael’s divine grace."

 phoenixPalaceFeatureDome:0 "Eventually, I make my way to the center of the palace, the largest room, and stand before the mighty dome just as the holy sun reaches its zenith. Before me, the rays of Light shift through windows onto their respective mirrors, forming a tapestry of Light, of Surael, glowing and resplendent, a display of beauty and faith unmatched anywhere else in Bulwar, or Halann for that matter. A faith which must spread, lest the world be forever doomed to darkness"
 phoenixPalaceFeatureWalls:0 "Eventually, as I make my way towards my own living quarters, my hand brushes along one of the many opulent walls, feeling the countless textures of marble, wood, and gem. Wealth imported from far beyond the extent of the Empire, lands which, in many cases, remain shrouded in darkness. Lands which, someday soon, shall be renewed through Surael’s Light."
 phoenixPalaceFeatureWindows:0 "Eventually, I stand before one of the palace’s countless stained glass windows, and as I stare at it, I see an image of Jaher, in the moment of his coronation as the first Phoenix Emperor. Will I ever live up to his legacy? Will the histories tell my name, as they do Jaher and Jexis?"

 phoenix_empire_lay_foundations_desc:0 "If we are to secure our legacy as the true heirs of Jaher, the chosen of Surael, we must ensure a seat of power with a level of splendor to match. Already, Bulwar’s finest architects have begun drafting plans for a magnificent palace to put all others on Halann to shame. Though this project will certainly be expensive, and surely take many years to complete, we have to begin somewhere. Lay the foundations, for the might of the Phoenix Emperor, for the glory of Surael!"
 phoenix_empire_construct_walls_and_pillars_title:0 "Phoenix Palace: Construct the Palace Wings"
 phoenix_empire_construct_walls_and_pillars_desc:0 "Though the foundations of the palace have been laid, what use is a palace full of empty rooms? Of course, there are those elements of a palace that are fundamentally important; the royal quarters, the servant’s quarters, and chambers for advisors. But now that the foundations have been laid, and designs decided, the function and design of the various outer palace wings and chambers must be deliberated upon."
 phoenix_empire_build_the_roof_title:0 "Phoenix Palace: Build the Centrepiece"
 phoenix_empire_build_the_roof_desc:0 "The third phase of construction; that of the centrepiece. The most extravagant symbol of Surael’s glory, a part of the palace which shall forever cement it not just as the seat of the Phoenix Emperor, center of the Empire, but a monument to the eternal glory of Surael."
 phoenix_empire_furnish_the_palace_title:0 "Phoenix Palace: Furnish the Palace"
 phoenix_empire_furnish_the_palace_desc:0 "Though the building itself is now completed, our new palace still lacks any decent furnishing, containing merely what is needed to be functional. We shall rectify this, and obtain furnishing and decorations of the highest quality. Silk cushions, golden tables, ivory bookcases, glass drapes, porcelain doors. Nothing but the finest and most expensive materials shall befit the glory of the Phoenix Empire!"
 phoenix_empire_plant_the_gardens_title:0 "Phoenix Palace: Plant the Gardens"
 phoenix_empire_plant_the_gardens_desc:0 "The gardens are, despite their relative separation from the rest of palace construction, nonetheless one of the most defining features of any royal abode. From the sweeping theming of gardens, down to the smallest minutia of soil composition and flower arrangement, all must be done perfectly, so as to build a garden truly representative of the might and beauty of the Phoenix Empire."
