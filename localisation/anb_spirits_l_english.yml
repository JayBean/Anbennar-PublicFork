 estate_adventurers_spirit_hunters:0 "Spirit Hunters"
 estate_adventurers_spirit_hunters_desc:0 "Adventurers are all proficient at monster-slaying and quest-completing, that is their trade. But a select few are able to handle the trickiest challenges of Haless: spirits. With enchanted blade and well-studied ritual, hostile spirits can be driven back, if not banished entirely. If we fund these adventurers, the spirit world will undoubtedly be less of a threat."
 estate_adventurers_temple_quest_licenses:0 "Temple Quest Licenses"
 estate_adventurers_temple_quest_licenses_desc:0 "The High Temples of Haless have always been a font of mystery, but one highly resilient to exploration. Now, with the invention of the Korashi Drill, we can bypass the temples' magical wards and delve into their secret chambers and hidden passages. It will not be cheap to sponsor adventurers on such an expedition, and it may offend some, but we cannot even begin to imagine the value of what might be waiting within."
 estate_mages_spirit_speakers:0 "Spirit Speakers"
 estate_mages_spirit_speakers_desc:0 "Mystics across Haless claim to have ways of connecting directly to the spirit world and speaking to its denizens. Some use elaborate rituals, others intense hallucinogenics, yet others a unique spell passed down through generations. Such behavior is rare in court, but if we task our mages with figuring out a true way to commune with our ancestors, who knows what we may learn?\n\n§YEnables Ancestral Communion events§!"
 ancestral_communion_pulse_tooltip:0 "We will attempt to communicate with our Ancestors, we will not be able to do this frequently."

 estate_mages_temple_desecrators_desc:0 "The High Temples are filled with traps, guardians, and defenses meant to keep those not meant to be there out. To overcome these trials, powerful and specialized dark magic is required. Let's train our sorcerers in these techniques and send them on expeditions."
 artifice_invention_korashi_drills:0 "Korashi Drills"
 artifice_invention_korashi_drills_desc:0 "Magic-forged steel. A nugget of damestear as power-source. And at the tip, a sharp point of black damestear, long known to the Halessi as Korashi. These are the components of the Korashi Drill, and with it, we can nullify the High Temples' wards and defenses, and begin excavation of these ancient Precursor complexes..."

 spirits.008.d:0 "As the last of the pulsing crimson in the Temple’s heart fades, it returns to its original pure shining blue at long last. We have succeeded in purging the foul corruption that had tainted the Temple Complex of [Root.GetName]. As long as we hold this great temple, it shall never again be misused for foul rituals!"
 spirits.008.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 spirits.010.t:0 "The Plundering of [Root.GetName]"
 spirits.010.d:0 "Having recently conquered the province of [Root.GetName], we have made a discovery of potentially great magnitude concerning the local Temple Complex! We have learned that those who previously had control of the Temple Complex were using Korashi Drills to plunder and pillage its ancient relics.\n\nWhile such actions will surely be frowned upon by some, it cannot be denied that they also present great opportunities for ancient riches and wisdom to be attained.\nHow should we proceed?"

The immense orb gently hovers in the middle of the room and slowly pulses with energy, almost as if it were a beating heart.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the core is made of Damestear and is most likely the source of power for the Complex’s defenses. It is undoubtedly important for the Temple Complex and its functions, but our Artificers and Mages are both clamoring for access to the artifact. Furthermore, the core presents a practical treasure trove of Damestear and could fetch us a high price if mined.\n\nWhat should we do with this Heart of the Temple?"

 spirits.014.d:0 "A gnomish master artificer at the institute of [temple_inquiry_institute_target.GetName] has published a paper which outlines a potential method of bypassing the defenses of High Temples. They hypothesize that, through the use of an exotic material recovered from Oni settlements, the potent magical defenses surrounding the High Temples might be breached, allowing access to whatever terrible wonders lie within. While this so-called Korashi material is scarce, gnomes at the institute have already begun work on a reliable method of production."

After numerous unsuccessful tests resulting in the nullification of some rather expensive magical equipment, the Mk. 5 DOLG Korashi drill has penetrated the Temple Complex of [korashi_drill_test_province.GetName]’s entry wards. Already the temple’s antechambers are filled with enterprising gnomish archaeologists, although further exploration into the antediluvian structure has been prevented by some truly devious trapmaking."

Now, as they plumb the deepest reaches of the temples, there are whispers of unimaginably powerful ancient artefacts, grand structures made entirely of damesTear, and huge hoards of lesser precursor relics."
 spirits.017.db:0 "The Halessi, in their lust for knowledge and power, have managed to breach the vaults of the enormous precursor temples that dot their landscape. News has reached us of their finds in the form of new and powerful objects on the open markets, coupled with rumours that deep within their temples lie even more potent artefacts. How this will affect us remains to be seen."

 spirits.101.t:0 "White Tiger Spotted!"
 spirits.101.d:0 "Taking a short but needed break from their duties, our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] recently went out for a quiet stroll in a nearby forest. There, among the lush greenery where shadows danced from the setting sun, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] caught a glimpse of something white out of the corner of their eye. To get a better look, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] turned and found themself eye to eye with the ethereal White Tiger standing some distance away. After staring at each other for a while, the White Tiger left and could no longer be found.\n\nThe rumors spread quickly throughout the realm and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]’s guards and attendants were able to give testimony and credibility to the story: that our great [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] was visited by the elusive White Tiger. After all, the White Tiger is a spirit that is only rarely seen by mortals and is said to only reveal itself to the just and virtuous. Thus, our subjects all rejoice at the thought of their [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] having been chosen by the White Tiger."
 spirits.101.a:0 "A sign from the Heavens!"
 spirits.102.t:0 "The Sky Runners"
 spirits.102.d:0 "Joyous crowds fill the streets across the nation as an impromptu festival is held to celebrate the visiting of the sky runners last night. All across the countryside there were sightings of the red horse spirits as they danced across the clouds, bringing luck and prosperity to all who saw their auroral drovings. We have also received reports from our horse breeders that several of their mares are mysteriously pregnant, confirming the rumours of their couplings with mortal horses."
 spirits.102.a:0 "Truly heavenly horses!"
 spirits.103.t:0 "What Lies Below"
 spirits.103.d:0 "The passage of some great, subterranean spirit has torn great rents in the earth of [Root.GetName], exposing large veins of valuable minerals that lie beneath the surface. Already teams of prospectors have set out to exploit this new wealth, setting up shrines to the unknown spirit in their new mineshafts. Meanwhile, the broken earth has caused some dismay amongst our surveyors, and they predict some difficulties developing the land until everything settles down."
 spirits.103.a:0 "Dig deeply and greedily!"
 spirits.104.t:0 "Yellow Springs"
 spirits.104.d:0 "While sneaking away from town to find a secluded place to cavort, a young couple in [Root.GetName] discovered a pristine hot spring, seemingly having appeared out of nowhere. The springs are guarded by a kindly turtle spirit, who, while voiceless, has been accepting offerings of coin and food from the people of the nearby towns in exchange for rejuvenating baths in the sulphurous springs. While we cannot begin to guess why they are here or when they will once again return to the spirit realm, the people of the region seem refreshed and content."
 spirits.104.a:0 "Good"
 spirits.105.t:0 "Jade Rabbit Miracles"
 spirits.105.d:0 "In one of our infirmaries, a man who was bedridden for months woke up miraculously healthy, claiming he had a dream of a jade rabbit giving him an elixir. Similar stories of this jade rabbit have been spreading throughout the realm, confirming the rumors that we have been visited by a rabbit spirit. As long as we are under its blessing, ours will be a strong and healthy people indeed."
 spirits.105.a:0 "I think my cold is going away!"
 spirits.106.t:0 "Divine Abduction!"
 spirits.106.d:0 "Peculiar reports have returned from across the countryside, they tell of swathes of vanished peasantry, whole villages, even the farm animals, missing. Perfunctory examinations of the affected regions have revealed that whatever took them has left the lingering scent of jasmine, and, oddly, a scattering of gold coins at the presumed location where our people disappeared. We can only presume they have been spirited away to places beyond the reach of our armies."

 #Undead Spirits
 
 spirits.201.t:0 "The Jackals of [Root.GetAreaName]"
 spirits.201.d:0 "They came in the night, sudden, furious, and terrible. Twisted creatures that bounded on all fours with the faces of men in pain and ecstasy. Their baying echoed through burning towns as they tore fleeing civilians limb from limb, watering the fields with blood. They have left several towns in ruin, and many homeless and poverty stricken.

As the sorcerers collapse under the pressure of its assault, one of the cracks begins to grow, and the spirit tears at the rent, desperate to be free. All that is left of the cadre of mages when a scouting party is sent down to investigate is smear of red painted across the temple walls, and a bottomless pit bored deep into the earth."

 #Temple Quest Encounter descriptions TODO: Can rewrite or just fluff them up - up to a paragraph or two at max, basically describing a fight with golems or a trap encounter with associated outcomes of either coming out fine or getting 1 party member wounded/killed - could whip up a custom loca string to reference the party leader (the Storied Bard/Veteran Fighter etc) if desired. Every killed string should end with "a party member was §Rwounded§!/§Rkilled§!" or a variation of that, as a Necromancer might raise them, adding " Fortunately for them, they were §RRaised§! from death by the Necromancer." at the end of the description string
 
 #Golem encounters (Precursor constructs, rudimentary and unthinking - NOT mechanim)
 
 golem_clear_key_desc1:0 "The party easily dispatched the ancient, rusted golems guarding this chamber."
 golem_clear_key_desc2:0 "The golem guarding this chamber was large and imposing at first, but fell quickly to the party's blows."
 golem_clear_key_desc3:0 "A dozen diminutive spider-like rustbuckets swarmed the party, but they were cleanly swept away."
 golem_wounded_key_desc1:0 "Before it fell, one of the rusted golems landed a mighty blow, §Rwounding§! a party member!"
 golem_wounded_key_desc2:0 "The ancient rustbuckets nearly overwhelmed the party, and one of the party members has been §Rwounded§!!"
 golem_wounded_key_desc3:0 "One of the party members slipped on the ancient stone while in combat with golems and is now §Rwounded§!!"
 golem_killed_key_desc1:0 "In a tough fight, a party member was §Rkilled§! by a golem!"
 golem_killed_key_desc2:0 "The party was nearly overwhelmed by golems in this chamber, and although they were victorious in the end one party member has succumbed to their wounds and §Rdied§!."
 golem_killed_key_desc3:0 "One of the golems in this chamber moved with a freakish speed, and a party member was §Rkilled§! before their companions could even blink."
 
 #Trap encounters
 
 trap_clear_key_desc1:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nBefore we entered a room, our party noticed a very obvious tripwire in front of the entrance. The wire was cut without further incident, or knowledge of what it could have done."
 trap_clear_key_desc2:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nHalting the rest of the party, one of my companions pointed out a risen brick in the floor - a pressure plate. Judging from the holes in the wall facing the pressure plate, activating it would likely leave the victim littered with bolts. The party stepped around the trap."
 trap_clear_key_desc3:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nA party member kicking a rock noticed at one point that the rock seemed to phase through the floor. An illusionary floor tile hid a pit trap of unknown depth. The edges were carefully marked and the trap was avoided."
 #christ there are 15 more
 trap_clear_key_desc4:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party came across a room that we noted to have blood and crushed bones littering the floor. We quickly deduced the room was rigged with a falling roof trap, so we activated it and used the roof to cross the room safely."
 trap_clear_key_desc5:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a chamber in which stood a large statue. Our history expert believed them to be an ancient, malevolent despot. The statue pointed towards an empty room. Considering the nature of the statue’s personage, the party made the wise decision to avoid the likely trapped room."
 trap_clear_key_desc6:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a room with floor tiles inscribed with symbols, some depicting virtues and some vices. One of our party members recognized them from an old nursery rhyme and explained that they were in the same order as how it is sung. Upon testing the first few tiles, their theory proved to be accurate, and we safely passed this trap."
 trap_clear_key_desc7:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party encountered a large room with some strange wind streams flowing across it from two different directions. Only some dust could be seen flying past, however just to be safe, we took great caution to avoid coming into contact with them."
 trap_clear_key_desc8:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large corridor with multiple rooms along both sides. The rooms seemed to contain horrifying statues of demons, monsters, and evil spirits. Some of us reported hearing voices calling out to them, but they wisely ignored them, focusing their gaze towards the end of the hall."
 trap_clear_key_desc9:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party decided to camp in a large room with a small hole in the roof, and had a moment of rest with laughter and good tales.

 trap_clear_key_desc10:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party encountered an overgrown hallway. We were about to continue down the hall when one of our group members noticed the vines leaking some kind of gas. The mage burned them away before proceeding."
 trap_clear_key_desc11:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large room with a pool of what seemed like fresh water. Testing the water however led to us discovering it was actually an odorless acid, so we went around it."
 trap_clear_key_desc12:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across an oddly featureless hallway. One of us decided to throw a rock down the hall just to be sure, and expected, its landing activated large blades that clanged against the opposite wall."
 trap_clear_key_desc13:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party passed by a dark room with what seemed like a little girl inside, whispering a nursery rhyme. Despite some concerns about her safety, we decided to ignore her and proceeded exploring the temple."
 trap_clear_key_desc14:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party found a room with statues with open mouths at eye height. We decided to keep our heads down, which proved to be smart, as we felt arrows whizzing past above us."
 trap_clear_key_desc15:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe group entered a room with three hallways and writings above each passage. One of our party members has extensive knowledge about ancient folktales, and solved the riddle that led us into the right hallway of the temple without danger."
 trap_clear_key_desc16:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe found a rickety rope bridge over a dark, seemingly bottomless chasm. The party decided to go one by one, very slowly, to prevent it from collapsing."
 trap_clear_key_desc17:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a room filled with small statues made of gemstones, gold and even damestear. Despite protests, we all agreed to not touch anything and leave the room unaltered."
 trap_clear_key_desc18:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe passed a large door with an inscription that apparently read: “Treasure Room”. We ended up ignoring this room, since it likely was just a trap. I hope it was anyway."
 trap_wounded_key_desc1:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of the party members clumsily hit a tripwire. Surprisingly, it didn’t trigger a trap, they just fell and hit their head. They’ll survive, but are now §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc2:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nA party member stepped on a well-disguised pressure plate. Dozens of bolts shot out of small holes in the walls and near-fatally §Rwounded§! them."
 trap_wounded_key_desc3:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a small room, and an invisible magical trap blasted one of the adventurers with potent force magic, throwing them against the wall. They are now §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc4:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a corridor with blood on the floor. Before we were even able to scan the room, the roof collapsed and landed on the foot of our front member, who is now §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc5:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a chamber where we found a large imposing statue pointing towards one of the rooms adjacent to us. One of our members' curiosity got the better of them, and they peeked into the room. They were shot in the knee by a small arrow, and are now §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc6:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe encountered a room that had a tile-patterned floor. One party member cautiously tried to cross the room, but fell through a floor tile. They managed to grab on the ledge just in time, but slammed against the wall in the process, becoming §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc7:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party encountered a large room with some strange wind streams flowing across it from two different directions. While we attempted to avoid contact with them, a more bulky member accidentally touched one and got §Rwounded§! when an obsidian shard pierced his ear."
 trap_wounded_key_desc8:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large corridor with multiple rooms along both sides. The rooms seemed to contain horrifying statues of demons, monsters, and evil spirits. One of our members stared at one of the statues for a bit too long, and now suffers from constant paranoia and nightmares. They will likely be mentally §Rwounded§! for life."
 trap_wounded_key_desc9:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party decided to camp in a large room with a small hole in the roof. During the night, the member on watch got bitten by a snake in the foot. They were able to warn the rest of us, but is now §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc10:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party approached an overgrown hallway. One member decided to scout ahead, but quickly returned vomiting from noxious gas that was coming from the vines. They’ll live, but are currently §Rwounded§! and sick."
 trap_wounded_key_desc11:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large room with a pool of what seemed like fresh water. One member decided it was smart to dip their toe in it. They now lack a toe and are §Rwounded§!, as it was acid."
 trap_wounded_key_desc12:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across an oddly featureless hallway. One member cautiously decided to scout ahead, but unfortunately triggered a hidden blade trap coming from the wall. The tip of their nose was cut off and they are now §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc13:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party passed by a dark room with what seemed like a little girl inside, whispering a nursery rhyme. Someone thought it would be funny to tell it to “Shut up”. In response, the mouth of the “girl” opened and the party member in question was knocked down and §Rwounded§! by a concussion spell that could have killed them if they had been any closer."
 trap_wounded_key_desc14:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of our members was scouting ahead and walked into a room with many statues. The statues each had open mouths at around eye level. Upon walking past the statues, one fired an arrow at them, and now they are §Rwounded§! with an arrow stuck in their cheek."
 trap_wounded_key_desc15:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across a room with three different exits, each with writing above their entrances. Our translator claims to have an extensive knowledge of folklore, but they weren’t confident they could solve the riddle behind this room. Knowing they might be wrong, the translator volunteered to go first, and almost slipped into a pit with spikes. They were slightly §Rwounded§! from falling, but luckily only sustained minor injuries."
 trap_wounded_key_desc16:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe found a rickety rope bridge over a dark, seemingly bottomless chasm. The party decided to go one by one, very slowly, but one of the party members was still §Rwounded§! from a muscle rupture anyway when they fell through a broken plank."
 trap_wounded_key_desc17:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe discovered a room filled with little statues made of gemstones, gold and even damestear. Despite promising to ignore them, one of our members wasn’t able to control their curiosity and greed, and tried to take a gold statue. It turns out they were extremely hot, and they were §Rwounded§! by a nasty burn."
 trap_wounded_key_desc18:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe happened upon a large door with the inscription “Treasure Room” written above it. Most of the group decided to ignore this obvious trap, but one member couldn’t help themselves and peeked inside. They were subsequently clawed in the face by a feral beast, leaving them §Rwounded§!."
 trap_killed_key_desc1:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of the party members clumsily hit a tripwire. It didn’t activate a trap, but they landed straight on their head, and died by §Rcracking their skull§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc2:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWithout thinking, a party member decided to touch an odd-looking relic, as there were no obvious traps in the room. Moments later, they were §Rincinerated§! by a magical trap."
 trap_killed_key_desc3:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of our members ran ahead of the group to loot the next room. A moment later, they vanished after falling through the solid floor. It turns out it was an illusionary floor, and they §Rfell into a pit of spikes§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc4:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe encountered a room with lots of blood and crushed bones on the floor.

 trap_killed_key_desc5:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a chamber where we found a large imposing statue pointing towards one of the rooms adjacent to us. Thinking it led to a treasure room, one of the party members decided to run in to take all the loot for themselves, and was §Rkilled by a hail of arrows§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc6:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe encountered a room that had a tile-patterned floor. Thinking the designs were just for decoration, one of the party members began to walk across, broke through the floor, and §Rfell into a dark abyss§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc7:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party encountered a large room with some strange wind streams flowing across it from two different directions. While we attempted to avoid contact with them, one of the party members went into a stream accidentally and got §Rpierced in the head by an arrow§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc8:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large corridor with multiple rooms along both sides. The rooms seemed to contain horrifying statues of demons, monsters, and evil spirits. One of the party members went to investigate one of the statues, went mad within seconds, and §Rslit their own throat to escape the agony§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc9:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party decided to camp in a large room with a small hole in the roof. During the night, the group was woken up suddenly by the screams of a party member who was being bitten by dozens of snakes. While the rest of us were able to get away safely, the one on watch §Rsuccumbed to the bites of dozens of angry snakes§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc10:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe happened along a long hallway that was overrun with vines. One of the party members decided to try to hack through them with a machete, releasing a lethal cloud of gas. Seconds later, they §Rdied to poison§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc11:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large room with a pool of what seemed like fresh water. One of the party members decided to go for a swim, and was §Rdissolved into nothingness by acid§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc12:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across a featureless hallway.

 trap_killed_key_desc13:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party passed by a dark room with what seemed like a little girl inside, whispering a nursery rhyme.

 trap_killed_key_desc14:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party found a room of statues with open mouths at eye height.

 trap_killed_key_desc15:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across a room with three different exits, each with writing above their entrances.

 trap_killed_key_desc16:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe found a rickety rope bridge over a seemingly bottomless chasm.

 trap_killed_key_desc17:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe discovered a room filled with little statues made of gemstones, gold and even damestear.

Upon taking it off its pedestal, they activated a trapdoor, and §Rfell into a  deep shaft with magma at the bottom§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc18:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe happened upon a large door with the inscription “Treasure Room” written above it.
