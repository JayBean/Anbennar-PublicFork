 estate_adventurers_spirit_hunters:0 "Spirit Hunters"
 estate_adventurers_spirit_hunters_desc:0 "Adventurers are all proficient at monster-slaying and quest-completing, that is their trade. But a select few are able to handle the trickiest challenges of Haless: spirits. With enchanted blade and well-studied ritual, hostile spirits can be driven back, if not banished entirely. If we fund these adventurers, the spirit world will undoubtedly be less of a threat."
 estate_adventurers_temple_quest_licenses:0 "Temple Quest Licenses"
 estate_adventurers_temple_quest_licenses_desc:0 "The High Temples of Haless have always been a font of mystery, but one highly resilient to exploration. Now, with the invention of the Korashi Drill, we can bypass the temples' magical wards and delve into their secret chambers and hidden passages. It will not be cheap to sponsor adventurers on such an expedition, and it may offend some, but we cannot even begin to imagine the value of what might be waiting within."
 estate_mages_spirit_speakers:0 "Spirit Speakers"
 estate_mages_spirit_speakers_desc:0 "Mystics across Haless claim to have ways of connecting directly to the spirit world and speaking to its denizens. Some use elaborate rituals, others intense hallucinogenics, yet others a unique spell passed down through generations. Such behavior is rare in court, but if we task our mages with figuring out a true way to commune with our ancestors, who knows what we may learn?\n\n§YEnables Ancestral Communion events§!"
 ancestral_communion_pulse_tooltip:0 "We will attempt to communicate with our Ancestors, we will not be able to do this frequently."
 estate_mages_temple_desecrators:0 "Temple Desecrators"
 estate_mages_temple_desecrators_desc:0 "The High Temples are filled with traps, guardians, and defenses meant to keep those not meant to be there out. To overcome these trials, powerful and specialized dark magic is required. Let's train our sorcerers in these techniques and send them on expeditions."
 artifice_invention_korashi_drills:0 "Korashi Drills"
 artifice_invention_korashi_drills_desc:0 "Magic-forged steel. A nugget of damestear as power-source. And at the tip, a sharp point of black damestear, long known to the Halessi as Korashi. These are the components of the Korashi Drill, and with it, we can nullify the High Temples' wards and defenses, and begin excavation of these ancient Precursor complexes..."

 spirits.010.d:0 "Having recently conquered the province of [Root.GetName], we have made a discovery of potentially great magnitude concerning the local Temple Complex! We have learned that those who previously had control of the Temple Complex were using Korashi Drills to plunder and pillage its ancient relics.\n\nWhile such actions will surely be frowned upon by some, it cannot be denied that they also present great opportunities for ancient riches and wisdom to be attained.\nHow should we proceed?"

The immense orb gently hovers in the middle of the room and slowly pulses with energy, almost as if it were a beating heart.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the core is made of Damestear and is most likely the source of power for the Complex’s defenses. It is undoubtedly important for the Temple Complex and its functions, but our Artificers and Mages are both clamoring for access to the artifact. Furthermore, the core presents a practical treasure trove of Damestear and could fetch us a high price if mined.\n\nWhat should we do with this Heart of the Temple?"

They hypothesize that, through the use of an exotic material recovered from Oni settlements, the potent magical defenses surrounding the High Temples might be breached, allowing access to whatever terrible wonders lie within. While this so-called Korashi material is scarce, gnomes at the institute have already begun work on a reliable method of production."

After numerous unsuccessful tests resulting in the nullification of some rather expensive magical equipment, the Mk. 5 DOLG Korashi drill has penetrated the Temple Complex of [korashi_drill_test_province.GetName]’s entry wards.

 spirits.017.db:0 "The Halessi, in their lust for knowledge and power, have managed to breach the vaults of the enormous precursor temples that dot their landscape.

There, among the lush greenery where shadows danced from the setting sun, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] caught a glimpse of something white out of the corner of their eye. To get a better look, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] turned and found themself eye to eye with the ethereal White Tiger standing some distance away. After staring at each other for a while, the White Tiger left and could no longer be found.\n\nThe rumors spread quickly throughout the realm and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]’s guards and attendants were able to give testimony and credibility to the story: that our great [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] was visited by the elusive White Tiger. After all, the White Tiger is a spirit that is only rarely seen by mortals and is said to only reveal itself to the just and virtuous. Thus, our subjects all rejoice at the thought of their [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] having been chosen by the White Tiger."

 spirits.103.d:0 "The passage of some great, subterranean spirit has torn great rents in the earth of [Root.GetName], exposing large veins of valuable minerals that lie beneath the surface. Already teams of prospectors have set out to exploit this new wealth, setting up shrines to the unknown spirit in their new mineshafts. Meanwhile, the broken earth has caused some dismay amongst our surveyors, and they predict some difficulties developing the land until everything settles down."

The springs are guarded by a kindly turtle spirit, who, while voiceless, has been accepting offerings of coin and food from the people of the nearby towns in exchange for rejuvenating baths in the sulphurous springs. While we cannot begin to guess why they are here or when they will once again return to the spirit realm, the people of the region seem refreshed and content."

Perfunctory examinations of the affected regions have revealed that whatever took them has left the lingering scent of jasmine, and, oddly, a scattering of gold coins at the presumed location where our people disappeared. We can only presume they have been spirited away to places beyond the reach of our armies."

 spirits.107.d:0 "Yakshini or Jazaoni, depending on whether you are in Rahen or the Yanshen, are nature spirits that appear in the shape of women. They are mostly associated with the Saraco Raheni or Saraka plant. This plant is used across all of Haless in rituals as burning the plant gives off a sweet smell that is said to ward off evil spirits. Legends say that this sometimes attracts Yakshini spirits, who, loving the smell of the plant will hang around the place that burned it and bless the area with luck and fortune.\n\nThis has now seemed to have happened in the province of [spirit_province.GetName] after a burning ritual was performed. The locals ask if they may expand their shrines and request funds to increase the burning of Saraka in the hopes of keeping the spirit around."
 spirits.107.a:0 "Surely we can spare some coin to help these people."

The shrines will be restored momentarily, but it may take quite a while until the most superstitious of locals dare to travel via that road again and the local economy is restored"

 spirits.110.d:0 "A travelling shaman has visited our court after having been rescued from bandits by our soldiers and offers their services to us as a thank you. They claim to be able to communicate with certain spirits and ask them to bless our nation with wisdom. They claim to have travelled many lands and have met many spirits, but that they have forged a unique bond with the following spirits:\n\nThe spirit of the Boabang peak. The Boabang peak is a mountain atop the Phokhao Range and the shaman has met this spirit while travelling to the Dwarven hold of Verkal Ozovar. When he got lost, it was the spirit who helped him find the way back to the right trail in exchange for keeping the lonely spirit company by travelling a longer route. They bonded and formed a unique kind of friendship with the shaman claiming to speak with the Boabang spirit regularly. They may ask the spirit to give us insight in mapping and pathfinding, which we can use to improve the functioning of our bureaucracy and taxation.\n\nThe spirit of the watersnake. When travelling across the rivers of the Lupulan rainforest in search of people to guide on spiritual matters. While originating from the region, they again got lost. That was until they encountered a wounded snake in the water. While locals would have seen the watersnake as dangerous and killed it, the shaman instead felt that something was different about the critter and decided to help it by removing a sharp tooth from its side and bandaging the wound. The watersnake then thanked the shaman by leaving an egg. When the shaman opened the egg, it contained some coins and a small bottle of liquor. And sometimes, the shaman claims, sometimes they find pieces of cloth, just like the bandage, as if the spirit is trying to return the “borrowed” bandage. The shaman may try to ask the watersnake for wisdom regarding water travel.\n\nThe White Tiger spirit. When traversing the jungles of Bomban, the shaman got lost again… Being desperate, the shaman tried multiple rituals to appease spirits and get help, yet nothing seemed to work until he heard something. In the distance they heard a faint cry from a tiger cub and decided to investigate it. They found the cub trapped in an old hunting trap and without a second thought decided to help the poor cub get out of the trap. Only then did they notice that the cub was all white with golden stripes. Not long after helping it did its mother appear, which was not only white, but a forest spirit herself. The tiger spirit helped the shaman by guiding them out of the jungle and claims to hear the tigers roar regularly when he is experiencing fear or doubt. The shaman hopes to communicate with the tiger spirit in the hopes of helping us attain a braver and nobler soldiery."\n\n The shaman gives us the option of one spirit to communicate with and gain their blessing"

And sadly this trust is sometimes misused by frauds and tricksters as has now happened to us. A shaman claimed to be able to communicate with a great yet unknown spirit who could not only bless our court, but our whole nation. Our advisors were sceptical until the shaman performed a spirit summoning in front of our ruler themselves! In hindsight, it seems to have been a simple magic trick without any spiritual involvement to speak of. After having agreed to a ritual, the shaman requested preparation time and a private room. They then snuck away and stole money from our coffers, not having been seen ever since.\n\nWhat should be done about this embarrassing incident?"

It now seems that a spirit has taken up the role of avenging them and is causing chaos in a small hamlet not far from the capital. The locals report that a goose is attacking any villager it comes across. We initially didn’t suspect a spirit yet the fact that this goose is using farming tools and small knives as weapons has given us a different perspective and we now suspect that the goose is either a spirit themselves or that a spirit has taken possession of a goose and is using it to spread chaos in the hamlet.

Their baying echoed through burning towns as they tore fleeing civilians limb from limb, watering the fields with blood. They have left several towns in ruin, and many homeless and poverty stricken.

Our guards in the region have reported familiar faces on the figures that walk within, old comrades slain in battle, great leaders from our nation’s past, all bearing the grisly wounds of war.

While it is usually used as a folk tale to scare children into behaving, it now seems to have manifested itself into reality. It appears that a spirit has taken on the identity of the folktale and is actually abducting children, good and bad alike. Many parents are afraid that their children will be taken away as well. This paranoia, combined with the disappearing children will hurt our population numbers in the area for the foreseeable future."

 spirits.153.d:0 "Haless is a continent with different spiritual and ritual practices in every hamlet, city or region. But all share some sort of veneration or respect for grandmothers, as they are the mothers of mother. This is done through either rituals, storytelling or unique traditions. Examples are a group of hamlets, deep in the Lupulan rainforest who mix the ashes of the deceased women into their farming soil so they can metaphorically give birth to food for the younger generations or the Phokhao sky cemeteries, where deceased grandmothers get mummified through the cold air and are regularly redressed and offered food, flowers, liquor and other goods so their ancestral spirits may look over the future generations.n\n\Samshimoni is a spirit who represents the grandmothers that are venerated and has been spotted regularly around cemeteries, ancestral shrines or other places of veneration, and sometimes repays the common people for their devotion as has happened now. It now seems that the province of {random_province} is blessed by Samshimoni as there is a spike in pregnancies and healthy births together with an increased amount of sightings of the Grandmother spirit.

What was shocking was the sheer number of guests who came to pay their respects. A parade of unfamiliar faces, often wearing clothing that was decades, sometimes even centuries out of fashion. \n\nIt wasn’t until a few days later had the people realised what had happened. Ancestral spirits from across the lands had come to pay their respects. Generations upon generations of elders were in attendance.

Orang Minyak seems to possess the uncanny ability to elude patrols and guards by moving silently on walls and ceilings.\n\nThe spirit incapacitates its victims by dripping oil into their mouths, causing them to fall into a coma-like state, and then carries them away into the darkness. Although most of the abducted individuals eventually return, they are deeply traumatized and refuse to communicate with anyone. Our suspicions about the intentions of this oily man are unclear, and as of now, there is no apparent solution to put an end to these horrifying attacks.

Strangely, they seem incapable of causing physical harm, as reports suggest they pass right through people without any tangible impact. Nevertheless, the terror they instill in the residents is genuine, leaving them demanding urgent action to expel these ghostly figures from the forest.\n\nThe fear and anxiety gripping the village have reached a breaking point, as the eerie nightly visits persist.

Nonetheless, everyone is familiar with the tale of Blackfang, a story passed down to children to instill a clear lesson. Legend has it that Blackfang served as a guardian of a small shrine in [Root.GetName] until an angry mob, fueled by baseless accusations of baby-eating, ended her life. The truth of these allegations is highly doubtful, but the outcome was tragically real. According to the lore, Blackfang's spirit now roams the Xianjie, seeking retribution against those who falsely accuse others of crimes they did not commit. While many consider this tale a cautionary fable, it seems that Blackfang has manifested herself in [Root.GetName].\n\nA notoriously unpopular magistrate, known for making false accusations and sentencing locals to boost personal revenue, met a gruesome fate. Snatched by a harpy adorned with dark green wings, black claws, and fangs, the magistrate was dropped from an astonishing height of around 100 meters onto the pavement of a bustling townsquare. The impact turned the once-corrupt magistrate into a puddle of remains, leaving no doubt about the severity of the strike. In the aftermath, Blackfang swiftly flew away.\n\nDespite the sudden and brutal nature of the attack, the locals have not shied away from showing their gratitude. Offerings have been left at a local shrine to honor and thank the spirit for her actions. While some may view it as a mere tale, the occurrence in [Root.GetName] has sparked belief in the vengeful presence of Blackfang. Her legendary pursuit of justice against false accusations seems to have manifested in a truly unsettling manner, sending a powerful message that resonates with the people."

Though formless, Shennong is known to wield influence over people's relationships and behaviors, both in positive and negative ways. Unfortunately, it appears that [Root.GetName] has experienced the negative consequences, with people now engaging in adultery almost openly.\n\nThis epidemic of infidelity is wreaking havoc on the province, tearing apart the social fabric and undermining its core values and norms. The widespread indulgence in adultery is profoundly damaging to the community, leading to fractured relationships, broken trust, and emotional turmoil.

Our ruler has taken such a path, attempting to forge a pact with Ngoho, a spirit renowned in tales for bestowing immortality upon those who seek it.\n\nThe ceremony was conducted with great solemnity, involving ritual chanting by shamans and the burning of incense. In the midst of this sacred atmosphere, our ruler fervently called upon the spirit to grant them immortality.

Moreover, the spirit of Vanyara, the protector of merchants, is known to employ punishment as a means to address a wide range of misdeeds related to fair trade and honest dealings.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the province of [Root.GetName] seems to be facing such challenges. An alarming rise in quacksalvers has emerged, comprising fake doctors, dentists, faulty tool salesmen, and spice merchants peddling colored sand. This proliferation has caused significant financial strain as we endeavor to suppress these dishonest traders and provide compensation to those who have suffered due to their deceitful practices.\n\nThere are strong suspicions that Vanyara's influence may be at play in this distressing situation. Many of the quacksalvers we apprehended were once well-known and respected merchants who now express remorse for their unlawful activities, attributing their transgressions to the influence of the Vanyaras.

Tragically, many have already succumbed to this affliction, and we fear more will perish in the days to come.\n\nInterestingly, it seems that Preta's impact is confined to a specific area, as those who have left the affected region regain their ability to eat. The duration of this hunger plague remains uncertain, but it undoubtedly threatens devastation and depopulation in the affected area for a considerable period."
 spirits.179.a:0 "I wasn’t hungry anyway"
 spirits.180.t:0 "Phi Am, Breaker of Sleeplessness"
 spirits.180.d:0 "Sleeplessness is an experience that everyone encounters at times. While it may be a source of frustration for many, for Phi Am, it serves as a source of energy. This unique spirit thrives on the sleeplessness of others and, in turn, grants them a restful night's sleep. As Phi Am travels through Southern Haless, its powers have a widespread effect, benefiting a whole area simultaneously. Remarkably, our nation has now been touched by Phi Am's influence, and our citizens and soldiers feel revitalized and rejuvenated every single morning. The overall discipline of our people has significantly improved, and our nation is now well-rested. Let us hope that Phi Am remains with us for a considerable time, so we may continue to enjoy peaceful and refreshing slumbers."

 spirits.200.d:0 "Monkeys are notorious thieves in villages already, but the Rending has released something even worse upon the people of [Root.GetName]: Spirit Monkeys.

 spirits.202.d:0 "It came first as mere whispers on the winds, a faint hint of something more. Steadily it grew louder, becoming a strange, chilling, twisted, and haunting howl. Coming mostly during heavy fog, storms, or at night, those who hear the howls are filled with dread, fear, and a sense of doom. Tales of the howling sea have become so commonplace that many sailors have begun to refuse to sail in poor conditions and overnight in our waters!"

 spirits.216.d:0 "You woke up and stepped out of bed like any other day, yet something was off. While you were still a bit doozy from sleeping you noticed that it was awfully quiet. No birds were chirping yet it was dawn, no wind chimes from the garding were singing yet you felt the wind on your face and there was no noise coming from the rest of the residential complex, yet it was to be a normal busy morning. And at that moment, while scratching an itch it dawned on you, that it was you who could not hear it./n/nShocked and terrified you screamed for the guards but they did not come and when you in fear and anger stormed out of your room, there were no guards, there were not even maids or servants in the hallways. Then all of a sudden you were touched by a sweaty palm and lunged back. It was the first minister who in panic handed you a note that reads: “Since last night, the whole city seems to have gone deaf, including you, me and even the animals.” Panicked, you gather your advisors and generals and hold a meeting in deafening silence via writing you pass around to each other. News comes in that the whole nation is affected and chaos is boiling. We cannot hear them but the common folk scream for an explanation and action. We suspect that spirits are at play and that we must increase our devotion. But how are we even going to spread an explanation if more than half of the population can’t read, write or hear? And even then, how are we going to convey that sacrifices and prayer are to increase? This operation will cost us a fortune while our nation slips into chaos and our enemies may even take advantage of this, we must act quick and while it may be costly, it may also save our nation."
 spirits.216.a:0 "Send messenger to explain to the common folk what to do via drawing instructions and giving examples. Have them increase their prayers and sacrifices!"

 spirits.250.d:0 "You wake up and step out of bed like any other day, yet something is off. You can hear, yes, hear a nightingale sing. Shocked and fearing you are going mad you walk to the balcony and there you see it, the nightingale singing from the top of a tree. You hear wind chimes clinging in the breeze singing as well and scratching an itch, you hear your nails on your skin. You let out an almost deafening scream of happiness and storm out of the room, finding your guards smiling that they too have regained their hearing. You go to your first minister who also hears again and so it seems does everybody in the nation. The nightmare is over, whether by the increased piety of the nation or just out of luck, but it is over. The nightingale sings again!"

 spirits.217.d:0 "Seasonal increases of dead jellyfishes washing up on the shores are nothing new in Haless, in fact they are considered a good marker for seasonal changes and changes in water temperatures. But this time, things are off, they smell. It all began when a larger than regular amount of jellyfish washed up, followed by more, and more, and more. They reek, a foul and poignant smell of salt fills the air on the beach, sometimes even terrorising the interior when the winds point west. People get sick and lethargic over the smell and it hampers with everyday life on the coast, on top of the pollution of the beaches and the dangers some extremely venomous jellyfishes like the Cobalt Dragon or the Feiten Great Junk pose to those that accidentally step on them. We suspect an angry oceanspirit is at play and may want to take action, whether that be trying to appease it or take other measures are now in our hands."

Though as days, weeks and event months started to pass by, people started to get second thought, with the spirits actively interacting with the world and people even to the most devoted Godlost, doubts started to creep inside their mind, no matter how hard they resist, how much they try to ignore the rending. It's still there, the spirits still walk upon the same earth as the Godlost and the masses slowly start doing various old traditions and rituals in the hopes to shield themselves from the spirits and the rending. And from that point on, many have begun to convert to the various old religions in Haless"

 spirits.223.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] gazes upon the flashing night sky from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace balcony. Pondering on what to do next during this disaster, “What could a single mortal do to change the course of this disaster?” He said underneath his breath. “More than most of you could imagine” Whispered back followed by the rulers swiftly looking around from where the voice came from, only to settle upon one of the corners of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] balcony. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] eyes squint as he tries to see more details about the silhouette in the dark corner. \n\n“What do you mean by that?” He retorts back, being cautious but open to hear since there was no hostility in the intruder's tone. “The Left Hand is a pathway to many abilities, some consider unnatural” Says the shadow “Abilities that grant power and with power you can change the path and future of your nation. I can teach you if you are interested to save your nation from this disaster” he whispered back, still standing in the corner but now with a dark hand waiting for you to accept it "
 spirits.223.a:0 "Accept his handshake “For the betterment of my nation”"

 spirits.224.t:0 "How did the Great Spirits become Great?"
 spirits.224.d:0 "”Great Spirits” are quite mysterious beings that are hardly researched or studied. Many Mystic Accord theologians try to study the many scrolls and myths about them, trying to uncover how they came to be or how they achieved to get such power. Such questions sometimes resonate with more powerful people and in this case [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Who´s curiosity is amplified with the occurring Rending of the Realms. Looking for any sliver of information on The Spirits and their magical might and such rumors quickly spread to many people across and even beyond the country till one slow day, around a slow evening a scholar requested a meeting with the ruler, The soldiers delivered a simple message to him which says “I can teach you how to become as Great as the Spirits themselves"
 spirits.224.a:0 "The Ruler hesitates at first before inviting the scholar to his court"

 spirits.225.d:0 "The citizens were exhausted both physically and spiritually in the province [Root.GetName]. For months they tried everything to stop this disaster and spirits intruded into their daily lives. So much sacrifice, money, faith, all the riches of the land and yet there was no hope in sight till one day A fog enrolled into the province. Along with it A giant humanoid figure with glowing Red eyes peering down upon the local towns. The people thought it was over, the spirits were finally coming for them but instead an equally giant hand came out of the fog along a voice telling that they still got more things to try out. A promise of change and power. Out of desperation and panic the people of the province  agreed to that."
 spirits.225.a:0 "I damn them for doing that. But alas these are desperate times…"
 spirits.226.t:0 "Dance with the Demons"
 spirits.226.d:0 "it was one of the yearly festivals being celebrated across the country. Every province is doing it in their unique way though as the Rending keeps playing in the night sky the citizens put extra effort in it, in the hopes that it might stop it and return the world to its old calm days. Twice as much incense is burning along other plants and leaves, special paper works, the festivals truly go wild as much as the giant pyre´s in the middle, smoke filling up whole towns as everyone is doing their best in the hopes to appease the Spirits. But during one such festival, just as midnight rolled in, when people were dancing, giant dark shadows quickly followed up dancing with the people and even Harimari, their moves imitating their dances, and soon the dark shades were replaced with colors as the citizens continued with the ritual. Oni´s both Red and Blue, participating in this festival, also hoping that this might appease the spirits. A special sight to behold as everyone was doing their best to stop a common foe or rather a disaster"

 spirits.226.b:0 "Perhaps not everyone Oni is bad?"
 spirits.227.t:0 "Fleeting moment and a quick escape"
 spirits.227.d:0 "The disaster started to take a toll on the ruler. With every passing day reports come from the people across the country. From local governors down to soldiers and patrols, spirits haunting areas, interrupting or even possessing people. Troops getting demoralized and even his own private chambers getting visited by all kinds of things leaving the ruler no moment to rest or recover for several days! Sounds and voices, and whole sceneries clashing between the mortal and spirit realm and at the end of the day, with him sitting there, barely grasping or changing anything. It's simply taking a heavy toll on the rulers spirit"

 spirits.228.d:0 "As spirits now freely roam the Plane, so do their continue with their lives. Though often they are following the mortals of this realm, with many traditions and myths coming true to some degree. Alas one of those are the spirits that follow soldiers, spirits that roam battles and past battlefields. Sadly we can´t influence or command the spirits to go away, at least not permanently. And on one such big occasion are spirits that sing and play sounds and songs of death. Usually played during funerals of soldiers, Now these spirits follow our soldiers and armies for almost every day. Most soldiers know what they signed up for but the constant stream of sounds and songs of doom and upcoming death is shaking even the ones with the strongest willpower. It's really putting a dent in the moral of our troops my Monarch"

 spirits.229.d:0 "During one of the many festivals being done to appease the spirits and to stop the Rending of Realms. The people from province [Root.GetName] have arranged a huge festival, inviting singers, musicians and bards from across Haless. They were successful and the festival played for hours till midnight arrived, which attracted the attention of the spirits at that point! Though instead of a disaster it turned into a great reception. In Fact the spirits played in unison with the citizens, people (mainly bards and musicians) were possessed as the spirits formed into various groups and bands, everyone playing their tune till it turned into a small musical fight against our citizens. The festival lasted the whole night up to sunrise, when the last bard fell unconscious from playing for so long. The spirits at the end of it were satisfied and for the next several months kept playing songs across our country, especially playing for our soldiers, raising their spirits as they are blessed by their tunes."

With curiosity and interest he looks around before noticing a rather bloody circle on the ground. \n\n“A blood ritual!? But who was sacrificed?” he looks around, noticing his noble robes along some scars on his arm, his estranged face quickly changes into a devious laughter “It seems like no matter how much time passes by, things rarely change don't they?" He says before getting up finding out more about his newly regained mortal life."

 spirits.232.t:0 "Second Revenge"
 spirits.232.d:0 "After the first little “incident” the heir sees one of his scars disappear. He thought that it was going to be harder to get rid of them but seeing that this was a contract on top of the ritual it would be wise to get rid of the scars as soon as possible in case someone important finds out. Luckily with the heir´social stance it was easy to find the next on the list as his scar itches at the sight of one of the generals serving in the army. With a little headache and a memory echoing back. He knew what to do. “Humiliating the heir to make your own son look better in front of the lord? Petty… he says underneath his breath before making a little sparring match with him"

At the sight of the governor and his son accompanying him he can feel his scar tremble. The heir´s eyes sharpen up before meeting with the governors and his son's eyes making some side remarks towards him. Even playing victim saying that the heir keeps giving them the “bad eye”. The heir does not enjoy being lied to and he's gonna make sure that they don´t mess around with a little tea party…"
 spirits.233.d:0 "Such humiliating governor! Gonna make sure that he works twice as hard for that disaster and ruined my outfit!"
 spirits.234.t:0 "Should I stay or should I go?"
 spirits.234.d:0 "The Heir takes a deep breath of air after the months of his “resurrection” From a small hill overlooking the palace from a distance. A small stone grave looking upon the capital with him standing underneath a chrysanth tree. The scars are fully healed but he was not called back to the spirit realm. It only made him ponder what was the right course of action now? He had the full freedom to take over one his “father” passes on and all the bad apples have been taken care off in the course. He could simply leave a younger but promising cousin to become the heir and leave him some incredible teachings before returning to the spirit realm. On the other hand he could live on leaving a mark upon the world, maybe leave a better life for himself and the people of this nation? "

The soldiers act and speak differently with some long forgotten accents but still follow orders with no questions or remarks, though they seem to struggle somewhat with the fire weapons and guns but their skills with classic weapons, spears and swords are suddenly second to none! They say that the soldiers are possessed but otherwise there is no harm."
 spirits.235.a:0 "As long as they follow my  and my general's orders they may fight on!"
 spirits.236.t:0 "Not to my Standards"
 spirits.236.d:0 "My Lord! The soldiers report having problems with the officers! They say that they are possessed, forcing them to train and spar to impossible standards! There were already accidents and even lives lost as the officers force on their commands! Their training styles reminded some soldiers and court members of old records from Xia, such training practices were stopped for the sheer amount of strain it gives to the soldiers but those that go through them are quick developed and trained beyond any normal standard. What shall we do?"
 spirits.236.a:0 "We can't sadly exorcise them but we might as well try to learn a thing or two from the past"
 spirits.237.t:0 "Thy ancestors smile upon thee"
 spirits.237.d:0 "While the ruler was initiating the meeting with the local governors and nobility, suddenly above him and the rest of the courtroom, shapes and faces of the past ruler suddenly emerged. Some of the older members quickly gasped in panic at the sight of the deceased now watching over them and the theme quickly changed as they gestured to speak first. Speechless as the court was, the ruler nervously nodded, gesturing them to talk which turned the mood in the room from shock to a pleasant moment as not only they praised the ruler but also accepted the nobility's conduct. Overall it ended with a great note. The royal advisors could only bow to the blessed current ruler knowing the ancestors' blessing that he was going to lead them to a brighter future."
 spirits.237.a:0 "And I shall not disappoint!"

Some of the older members quickly gasped in panic at the sight of the deceased now watching over them and the theme quickly changed as they gestured to speak first. As speechless as the court was, the ruler nervously nodded, gesturing them to talk which turned the mood in the room from shock to an unpleasant moment as the spirits of the past speak from one bad not to the other. Pretty much an hour passing by before the spirits spoke out their takes on the ruler before disappearing. That left a bad taste in the court who look like they lost some hope with how the nation might fare in the future"
 spirits.238.a:0 "I hope that I can prove them wrong in the future…"
 spirits.239.t:0 "Not yet done"
 spirits.239.d:0 "It was during one of the tea ceremonies with the local governors attending and discussing the local policies and how the real fares. A common event for the court tho during the meeting the ruler dropped his tea, staining his precious outfit. The servants quickly rush for the ruler, making sure that he is fine before he simply raises his hands and tells them to go back to their posts before he eyes the rest of the court. Everyone else is suddenly nervous at the tense and strict way the ruler spoke before requesting to repeat the state of the nation during the Times of Rending. What previously was an unsure tone on how to deal with the Rending and the Temple, now is a firm and confident tone as almost as he speaks with experience or knowledge about this. Whatever it may be he knows what he does"

 spirits.240.d:0 "We got reports of unusual spirit sightings, to be more precise our scouts reported herds of spirit elephants walking day and night through the countryside. What we assumed first to be some ill omen or them potentially attacking our citizens quickly turned out that it was no such thing. The Spirits were traveling older paths forgotten through time and wars. Though they might be dirt paths they still give us a big tactical advantage incase we need to move our armies swiftly across the country"
 spirits.240.a:0 "We need to make sure to honor such gentle spirits for their gift."

 spirits.403.t:0 "Temple Complex Neglected"
 spirits.403.d:0 "The Temple Complex of [Root.GetName]  has been in disrepair for some time now, and those who regularly visit it are requesting that the state do something about it.

Surprisingly, our infrastructure is already struggling to cope with the sheer number of visitors, and the pilgrimage season has not even officially started yet. The arrival of pilgrims not only brings increased footfall to the temples but also attracts merchants and encourages generous donations to the local religious establishments. However, what is perhaps most significant for us is the thriving economic activity resulting from the exchange of money during this pilgrimage.\n\nWith the pilgrimage season yet to reach its peak, we can anticipate a substantial and sustained boost to the local economy in the foreseeable future."

 spirits.408.d:0 "It happened during a routine patrol by the local temple guard, which are usually done by soldiers in pairs and are normally uneventful. Though it's not uncommon that soldiers are spooked or “See things'' as they do patrols,  happening mostly after the sun settles and the area is bathed in moonlight. That's when one curious soldier wandered off into the temple, claiming he saw some faint yellow glow or aura leading into the temple, only to fall unconscious and wake up again in an outer courtyard of the temple. What really happened he can't recall, no matter how hard he tries, and not even mages could help him recover his memory. He does however know that he ventured deep into the temple, through the impenetrable darkness of the temple's heart before it all turned black. And whatever happened there, it loaded his body with chi and opened his inner chi gates. Gaining not only strength but also a wealth of knowledge. We suggest that he is made into a wizard general as he can be a powerful and loyal officer to our realm and ruler"

In Fact some of the local populace called for the army to stop this nonsense as a few sides and event cults started to get physical upon each other!

 spirits.411.t:0 "Ever growing piety"
 spirits.411.d:0 "One of the unique things about the temples, besides their intimidating size and height, is their ability to invoke the spiritual side of people in the province of a high temple. Soldiers are known after guarding the High Temples for a decent amount of time or after their service time to lay down their arms and join the local priesthood in the temple. Mostly describe it as a religious call within themselves but many officers and court members suggest that the temples do influence the people in a way but don´t know why or how"

 spirits.412.t:0 "Center of Faith, Center of Trade"
 spirits.412.d:0 "With the High Temple finally standing tall, restored to its previous previous radiating glory, like aeons before it started to attract the masses across of Haless, halessi, Harimari, even dwarves and kobolds flock towards the Temple Complex in search for inspiration and faith. Tho such large influx of visitors quickly brought the attention of the Merchant class and traders too as culture and religion are being exchanged and studied, along with that plenty of exotic trade goods as well, and so a mayor of [Root.GetName] came forth asking for the Ruler to invest some funds to the local province so they may set up a Trade Center in the province”

Alarms were raised and the local militia quickly assembled and rushed into the temple which the Oni started to tear through the deep chambers of the temples, walls torn down, gates and doors smashed as if they were looking for something. Though what specifically they were looking for, we did not find out as the local militia heroically fought and slayed the huge demons as fast as they could to stop the desecration of the temple, which sadly was not enough. Through the ruins we did find some strange artifacts belonging to the Oni and some which did not…"

 spirits.414.t:0 "But to push deeper?"
 spirits.414.d:0 "As ordered, the local militia at the orders of our ruler, went deeper into the temple, after the path of destruction left by the demons. Which was easy to notice by the devastation they left behind though judging by the path they systematically plundered through the deep chambers of the Temple Complex. In fact at the very end of the trail we found a group of them, standing in a moderate sized room. All standing on their feet but with their eyes missing their pupils, nothing not even stabbing them caused a reaction, almost like they were unconscious or dead. The militia men moved them as quickly as possible out of the temple, trying to interrogate them later. As for the room where they stopped, its corners and walls were engravings and strange trinkets decorating the walls belonging to none of the religions or people that we know. What shall we do with them Sire?"

Even after so many centuries adventurers still find all kinds of artefacts and trinkets inside them or various and mysterious notes and writing on the wall or old parchments. Today my lord you received a message of a known adventurer band, requesting your permission and some investment to search through one of your High Temples my liege. Tho be aware, sometimes they may do more harm than good"

 spirits.416.t:0 "The Carvings of the Ancestors: The Monkey?"
 spirits.416.d:0 "High Temples generally abound with embellishments in the form of murals, each narrating its unique tale. While certain paintings find clear and easily interpretable explanations, others remain enigmatic, defying decipherment. Among these enigmatic artworks, one holds the centre stage in an impassioned discourse—what is the nature of this creature? The majority of onlookers and scholars perceive it as a simian entity, yet an assertive faction contends that it is, in fact, a Goblin. The debate has now escalated to a point where these groups have taken to labelling each other as "apelovers" and "Goblingrouppies". At this juncture, our sovereign's intervention is sought to adjudicate and ascertain the true subject of the depiction."

 spirits.417.d:0 "An ordinarily unobtrusive wall within the High Temple of [Root.GetName] bears carvings that have endured the passage of epochs. During a visit to the High Temple, our esteemed ruler paused, contemplative. What could that semicircle symbolise? Is it an empty vessel, evoking hunger's grip? Does it encapsulate the Moon's sway over tides? Might it form part of a ritual, a vestige of a bygone custom enshrouded in the mists of antiquity? Or does it harbour an altogether distinct significance, a riddle yet unsolved? Its import cannot be denied! Casting a discerning gaze around, they sought the insights of a groundskeeper, an individual deeply attuned to the temple's essence. As the groundskeeper's gaze alights upon the carving, a moment of contemplative silence passes, and then, with a sudden burst of certainty, they exclaim:"
 spirits.417.a:0 "That’s a bowl, for fruit probably"
 spirits.417.b:0 "That’s the Moon, sometimes at least"
 spirits.417.c:0 "That’s hat. Smart hat"

 spirits.418.t:0 "Quarrel at the Temple"
 spirits.418.d:0 "High Temples are typically sanctuaries subject to vigilant oversight by authorities; however, on occasion, unforeseen incidents transpire. A dispute between two merchants within the revered High Temple of [Root.GetName] escalated into a chaotic fight, involving into a clash of at least twenty individuals. Projectiles were hurled, heads bashed, and bodies smashed. While the prompt intervention of local guards ultimately quelled the brawl, tragically, two lives were lost and multiple participants sustained grave injuries. Compounding the distress is the lamentable fact that the temple itself incurred some measure of damage, fortunately not extensive enough to necessitate extensive restorative efforts."
 spirits.418.a:0 "Have the state pay for the repairs."
 spirits.418.b:0 "Demand payment from one of the two parties."
 spirits.418.c:0 "Demand both parties to pay for the repairs."
 spirits.419.t:0 "Cult of the Evil Moon"
 spirits.419.d:0 "The High Temples are like a puzzle we can't solve. Even though we've been near them for ages, we still don't know why they were built or who specifically built them. We know that it was a precursor realm, but the reasons behind them remain a mystery. This mystery has led to some strange ideas over time, like the thought that ancient aliens made them or that they were built by a kingdom that got submerged. Even though these ideas might sound a bit crazy, they've attracted quite a few people. Unfortunately, another idea has caused trouble. A group, more like a cult, has taken control of the High Temple in [Root.GetName]. The cult claims to know the real purpose of the temples. They say the temples, especially their centre, are actually powerful weapons that can be used to destroy what they call the ultimate source of evil: the moon.It might sound really weird and hard to believe, but we need to act and get the temple back from them before they cause serious damage."
 spirits.419.a:0 "Crush those moonies!"
 spirits.420.t:0 "Cult of Sacred Love"
 spirits.420.d:0 "The true purpose of the temples remains a mystery to us. However, this hasn't prevented people from concocting peculiar theories. Whether it's suggestions of a hidden indoor pool that heals all ailments or assertions that it once served as a refuge for an ancient Chickendeity, each theory seems more outlandish than the last. \n\nRecently, a new theory has surfaced, involving a High Temple in [Root.GetName]. A group known as the "Freelovers'' has seized control of the temple, transforming it into an open-air brothel where all are encouraged to indulge in worldly desires, or so they profess. According to their belief, the High Temples were sacred places where the precursors engaged in almost ritualistic acts of love. And while their theory is undoubtedly absurd and probably won’t take hold, many are calling for the expulsion of these "Freelovers" from the temple before their actions tarnish the sanctity of the entire site."
 spirits.420.a:0 "Give the soldiers some gloves and expel them"
 spirits.421.t:0 "title, not to long please"
 spirits.421.d:0 "War means devastation and pillaging of holy sites, including the High Temples. And even their profound importance doesn't shield them from being ravaged in times of conflict. The High Temple located in [Root.GetName] fell victim to plundering, resulting in the loss of both ancient relics and more contemporary artefacts. Moreover, the structure itself sustained extensive damage from the ravages of fire. The timeline for reclaiming the province remains uncertain, yet it is evident that substantial repairs are imperative. Our informants embedded within the city report concerning findings: cracked walls, the burning of wooden elements within, and a shroud of soot covering the entire complex. While our aspiration is to regain authority over the structure, we cannot afford complacency until [hostile_country] takes responsibility and bears the cost of the repairs."

 spirits.426.d:0 "The Ruler, being on the throne for so long and always hears all kinds of stories or events happening around the High Temple Complexes decided to visit them, perhaps out of curiosity or perhaps out of an inner calling. And So with a small elite escort he makes way, guided by a high priest as he tours the ruler through it. Explaining to him what they know about it and the many theories and practices around the temple. Though as the guide continues diligently telling the stories the lord gets distracted, his pace slowing down as he and his guard follow the guide till at one point even the elite guard got distracted by the leading priest, leaving the lord to look what appears to be a faint yellowísh color in the air, like some steam leading him to one of the many side chambers, his ears deaf as he follows the faith yellow fog path towards an empty room only to be suddenly stricken by lightning! Or was it something else? Looking around and waking up from the trance he does not recall anything else, just a small and empty golden chamber. The guards soon after rush towards the Ruler and bring him out, to be taken care by trained doctors."

Hitting all chi points and making sure no bad chi is left in his body after the incident from the Temple, though as the final needle is put inside him he suddenly jolts on the table, almost as if he was hit by lightning his body shook! His fists clench and the doctors quickly remove the needles before The Ruler slowly gets up unhindered by any injury, in fact he never felt better before! The doctors are rather stunned how fast the Ruler moved as he tended to lag behind in movement. They ask him to lay down to check once more only to find out that nothing was wrong? While the doctors spoke and checked with each other the Ruler was already out on his throne, leading the nation anew into a better direction"

Soft tunes playing out his whole life up to this point, the harsh yought, the ever threatening coronation as the new ruler. All the decisions, be it good or bad that brought him to this point under this chrysanthe tree. At that moment only he could be heard, across the small valley, attracting citizens to check the source of the soothing sounds. Gathering people by the hundreds, even smaller spirits appeared around the Tree, everyone listening quietly to the story of his flute."

 spirits.429.t:0 "Not just Adventurers"
 spirits.429.d:0 "My lord! We got a report of wild animals attacking The High Temples and the towns around it! We are not sure what happened but all kinds of creatures attacked, from wild dogs, to tigers, even an elephant herd have been seen trampling and attacking the buildings in the High Temple province! We are not sure what attracted them there but we must do something quickly!"
 spirits.429.a:0 "Dispatch the army!"
 spirits.430.t:0 "Wisdom of a merchant"
 spirits.430.d:0 "During one trip to the High Temples the ruler got approached by a merchant of renown. Asking him what's the difference between Faith and Trade? The obvious point was, one was a spiritual matter and the other one a material. “No! But also yes” was the merchant's reply “Both are in principle the same. Exchange one to gain something else, in this case we exchange our time and dedication into faith to get the blessings of Spirits, gods or even oneselves. Trade does that too, exchanging our time and dedication to gain goods, money and wealth. That does not mean that they have to be separate, no? In the end we merchants do also exchange our wealth and goods to enrich ourselves in faith and piety. But there are exceptions on both sides, no? If you are interested I like to discuss some more with you"

All that is left of the cadre of mages when a scouting party is sent down to investigate is smear of red painted across the temple walls, and a bottomless pit bored deep into the earth."

 #Temple Quest Encounter descriptions TODO: Can rewrite or just fluff them up - up to a paragraph or two at max, basically describing a fight with golems or a trap encounter with associated outcomes of either coming out fine or getting 1 party member wounded/killed - could whip up a custom loca string to reference the party leader (the Storied Bard/Veteran Fighter etc) if desired. Every killed string should end with "a party member was §Rwounded§!/§Rkilled§!" or a variation of that, as a Necromancer might raise them, adding " Fortunately for them, they were §RRaised§! from death by the Necromancer." at the end of the description string

 trap_clear_key_desc6:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a room with floor tiles inscribed with symbols, some depicting virtues and some vices.

Upon testing the first few tiles, their theory proved to be accurate, and we safely passed this trap."
 trap_clear_key_desc7:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party encountered a large room with some strange wind streams flowing across it from two different directions.

 trap_clear_key_desc11:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large room with a pool of what seemed like fresh water. Testing the water however led to us discovering it was actually an odorless acid, so we went around it."
 trap_clear_key_desc12:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across an oddly featureless hallway. One of us decided to throw a rock down the hall just to be sure, and expected, its landing activated large blades that clanged against the opposite wall."
 trap_clear_key_desc13:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party passed by a dark room with what seemed like a little girl inside, whispering a nursery rhyme.

 trap_clear_key_desc15:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe group entered a room with three hallways and writings above each passage.

 trap_clear_key_desc16:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe found a rickety rope bridge over a dark, seemingly bottomless chasm. The party decided to go one by one, very slowly, to prevent it from collapsing."
 trap_clear_key_desc17:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a room filled with small statues made of gemstones, gold and even damestear. Despite protests, we all agreed to not touch anything and leave the room unaltered."
 trap_clear_key_desc18:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe passed a large door with an inscription that apparently read: “Treasure Room”. We ended up ignoring this room, since it likely was just a trap. I hope it was anyway."
 trap_wounded_key_desc1:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of the party members clumsily hit a tripwire. Surprisingly, it didn’t trigger a trap, they just fell and hit their head. They’ll survive, but are now §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc2:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nA party member stepped on a well-disguised pressure plate. Dozens of bolts shot out of small holes in the walls and near-fatally §Rwounded§! them."

 trap_wounded_key_desc4:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a corridor with blood on the floor.

 trap_wounded_key_desc6:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe encountered a room that had a tile-patterned floor.

 trap_wounded_key_desc9:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party decided to camp in a large room with a small hole in the roof.

 trap_wounded_key_desc12:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across an oddly featureless hallway.

 trap_wounded_key_desc13:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party passed by a dark room with what seemed like a little girl inside, whispering a nursery rhyme.

 trap_wounded_key_desc16:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe found a rickety rope bridge over a dark, seemingly bottomless chasm.

 trap_wounded_key_desc17:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe discovered a room filled with little statues made of gemstones, gold and even damestear.

It turns out they were extremely hot, and they were §Rwounded§! by a nasty burn."
 trap_wounded_key_desc18:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe happened upon a large door with the inscription “Treasure Room” written above it.

 trap_killed_key_desc2:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWithout thinking, a party member decided to touch an odd-looking relic, as there were no obvious traps in the room. Moments later, they were §Rincinerated§! by a magical trap."
 trap_killed_key_desc3:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of our members ran ahead of the group to loot the next room.
