 #Privileges
 
 estate_adventurers_spirit_hunters:0 "Spirit Hunters"
 estate_adventurers_spirit_hunters_desc:0 "Adventurers are all proficient at monster-slaying and quest-completing, that is their trade. But a select few are able to handle the trickiest challenges of Haless: spirits. With enchanted blade and well-studied ritual, hostile spirits can be driven back, if not banished entirely. If we fund these adventurers, the spirit world will undoubtedly be less of a threat."
 estate_adventurers_temple_quest_licenses:0 "Temple Quest Licenses"
 estate_adventurers_temple_quest_licenses_desc:0 "The High Temples of Haless have always been a font of mystery, but one highly resilient to exploration. Now, with the invention of the Korashi Drill, we can bypass the temples' magical wards and delve into their secret chambers and hidden passages. It will not be cheap to sponsor adventurers on such an expedition, and it may offend some, but we cannot even begin to imagine the value of what might be waiting within."
 estate_mages_spirit_speakers:0 "Spirit Speakers"
 estate_mages_spirit_speakers_desc:0 "Mystics across Haless claim to have ways of connecting directly to the spirit world and speaking to its denizens. Some use elaborate rituals, others intense hallucinogenics, yet others a unique spell passed down through generations. Such behavior is rare in court, but if we task our mages with figuring out a true way to commune with our ancestors, who knows what we may learn?\n\n§YEnables Ancestral Communion events§!"
 ancestral_communion_pulse_tooltip:0 "We will attempt to communicate with our Ancestors, we will not be able to do this frequently."
 estate_mages_temple_desecrators:0 "Temple Desecrators"
 estate_mages_temple_desecrators_desc:0 "The High Temples are filled with traps, guardians, and defenses meant to keep those not meant to be there out. To overcome these trials, powerful and specialized dark magic is required. Let's train our sorcerers in these techniques and send them on expeditions."
 artifice_invention_korashi_drills:0 "Korashi Drills"
 artifice_invention_korashi_drills_desc:0 "Magic-forged steel. A nugget of damestear as power-source. And at the tip, a sharp point of black damestear, long known to the Halessi as Korashi. These are the components of the Korashi Drill, and with it, we can nullify the High Temples' wards and defenses, and begin excavation of these ancient Precursor complexes..."

 spirits.004.t:0 "Temple Complex Restored"
 spirits.004.d:0 "After many years of hard and painstaking labor, our workers are finally finished!\n\nThe Temple Complex of [Root.GetName] has been restored to its former splendor and glory, and is once again truly a sight to behold."
 spirits.004.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 spirits.008.t:0 "Temple Complex Purified"
 spirits.008.d:0 "As the last of the pulsing crimson in the Temple’s heart fades, it returns to its original pure shining blue at long last. We have succeeded in purging the foul corruption that had tainted the Temple Complex of [Root.GetName]. As long as we hold this great temple, it shall never again be misused for foul rituals!"
 spirits.008.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 spirits.010.t:0 "The Plundering of [Root.GetName]"
 spirits.010.d:0 "Having recently conquered the province of [Root.GetName], we have made a discovery of potentially great magnitude concerning the local Temple Complex! We have learned that those who previously had control of the Temple Complex were using Korashi Drills to plunder and pillage its ancient relics.\n\nWhile such actions will surely be frowned upon by some, it cannot be denied that they also present great opportunities for ancient riches and wisdom to be attained.\nHow should we proceed?"
 spirits.010.a:0 "The secrets of the so-called Gods are ours!"
 spirits.010.b:0 "End this barbarous despoiling"
 spirits.010.c:0 "Interesting...if only we could make our own Korashi Drills."
 spirits.012.t:0 "Temple Heart Discovered!"

 spirits.014.d:0 "A gnomish master artificer at the institute of [temple_inquiry_institute_target.GetName] has published a paper which outlines a potential method of bypassing the defenses of High Temples. They hypothesize that, through the use of an exotic material recovered from Oni settlements, the potent magical defenses surrounding the High Temples might be breached, allowing access to whatever terrible wonders lie within. While this so-called Korashi material is scarce, gnomes at the institute have already begun work on a reliable method of production."

After numerous unsuccessful tests resulting in the nullification of some rather expensive magical equipment, the Mk. 5 DOLG Korashi drill has penetrated the Temple Complex of [korashi_drill_test_province.GetName]’s entry wards.

There, among the lush greenery where shadows danced from the setting sun, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] caught a glimpse of something white out of the corner of their eye. To get a better look, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] turned and found themself eye to eye with the ethereal White Tiger standing some distance away. After staring at each other for a while, the White Tiger left and could no longer be found.\n\nThe rumors spread quickly throughout the realm and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]’s guards and attendants were able to give testimony and credibility to the story: that our great [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] was visited by the elusive White Tiger. After all, the White Tiger is a spirit that is only rarely seen by mortals and is said to only reveal itself to the just and virtuous. Thus, our subjects all rejoice at the thought of their [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] having been chosen by the White Tiger."

All across the countryside there were sightings of the red horse spirits as they danced across the clouds, bringing luck and prosperity to all who saw their auroral drovings. We have also received reports from our horse breeders that several of their mares are mysteriously pregnant, confirming the rumours of their couplings with mortal horses."

 spirits.103.d:0 "The passage of some great, subterranean spirit has torn great rents in the earth of [Root.GetName], exposing large veins of valuable minerals that lie beneath the surface. Already teams of prospectors have set out to exploit this new wealth, setting up shrines to the unknown spirit in their new mineshafts. Meanwhile, the broken earth has caused some dismay amongst our surveyors, and they predict some difficulties developing the land until everything settles down."

The springs are guarded by a kindly turtle spirit, who, while voiceless, has been accepting offerings of coin and food from the people of the nearby towns in exchange for rejuvenating baths in the sulphurous springs.

 spirits.107.d:0 "Yakshini or Jazaoni, depending on whether you are in Rahen or the Yanshen, are nature spirits that manifest in the form of women. They are mostly associated with the Saraco Raheni or Saraka plant. This plant is used throughout Haless in rituals because burning it emits a sweet smell believed to repel evil spirits. Legends state that this sometimes attracts Yakshini spirits, who, enamored by the plant's fragrance, linger around the location where it was burned and bestow luck and fortune upon the area.\n\nNow, it appears that this phenomenon has occurred in the province of [Root.GetName] after a burning ritual was performed. The locals inquire whether they may expand their shrines and seek funds to increase the burning of Saraka in the hope of retaining the spirit's presence."

Vile bandits have plundered the spirit shrines that safeguard the local roads, leading to a weakening of the local economy. Many peasants and merchants are now reluctant to travel on that road as it is considered "spiritually damned."

 spirits.110.t:0 "Talented Shaman"
 spirits.110.d:0 "A traveling shaman has graced our court with their presence, having been rescued from bandits by our soldiers. In gratitude, they offer their services to us, claiming the ability to communicate with certain spirits and seek their blessings for our nation's wisdom. The shaman asserts that they have journeyed through many lands and established unique bonds with several noble spirits:\n\nThe spirit of the Boabang peak, a mountain atop the Phokhao Range. The shaman encountered this spirit while traveling to the Dwarven hold of Verkal Ozovar. Lost and in need of guidance, the spirit offered help, guiding the shaman back to the right trail. In return, the shaman kept the spirit company by taking a longer route. Since then, they claim to regularly converse with the Boabang spirit. The shaman proposes to seek insight from this spirit to improve our bureaucracy and taxation through enhanced mapping and pathfinding.\n\nThe spirit of the watersnake. While traversing the rivers of the Lupulan rainforest to offer spiritual guidance, the shaman once again lost their way. They encountered a wounded watersnake and, instead of viewing it as a threat, chose to aid the creature by removing a sharp tooth and tending to its wound. In gratitude, the watersnake left an egg containing coins and a small bottle of liquor. On occasions, the shaman claims to find pieces of cloth, similar to the bandage they had used, as if the spirit is trying to return it. The shaman seeks to ask the watersnake spirit for wisdom regarding water travel.\n\nThe White Tiger spirit. While traversing the jungles of Bomban, the shaman found themselves lost once more. Desperate, they performed various rituals to appease spirits for help, but none seemed to work until they heard a faint cry from a tiger cub in the distance. Investigating, they discovered a white cub with golden stripes trapped in an old hunting trap. Without hesitation, the shaman freed the cub, only to find that its mother, a forest spirit, was also white. Grateful for the rescue, the tiger spirit guided the shaman out of the jungle and continues to provide reassurance through its roar whenever the shaman experiences fear or doubt. The shaman aims to communicate with the tiger spirit to aid us in fostering a braver and nobler soldiery."

 spirits.111.d:0 "The shamans of the Mystical Accord faith are well-liked and respected as intermediaries between the corporeal and the spiritual. Unfortunately, frauds and tricksters sometimes misuse this trust, as has now happened to us. A shaman claimed to be able to communicate with a great yet unknown spirit who could not only bless our court but our whole nation. Our advisors were skeptical until the shaman performed a spirit summoning in front of our ruler themselves! In hindsight, it seems to have been a simple magic trick without any spiritual involvement to speak of. After agreeing to a ritual, the shaman requested preparation time and a private room. They then snuck away and stole money from our coffers, and they have not been seen ever since."

 spirits.112.d:0 "Geese are generally not held in high regard in Haless, and many view their meat as subpar compared to duck or other waterfowl. These waterbirds are not treated well, and some even consider them pests that should be eliminated. Now, it appears that a spirit has taken up the role of avenging them and is causing chaos in a small hamlet not far from the capital. The locals report that a goose is attacking any villager it comes across. Initially, we didn't suspect a spirit, but the fact that this goose is using farming tools and small knives as weapons has given us a different perspective. We now suspect that the goose is either a spirit itself, or that a spirit has possessed a goose and is using it to spread chaos in the hamlet."

Many haven’t slept in days, and–BONG! BONG! BONG!–there is no end in sight. The court proposes that we provide additional–BONG! BONG! BONG!–offerings to ancestral shrines in the hopes of appeasing the gongs. However, there is always the direct method, wherein we attempt to shoot these curiosities out of the sky, but, simply put, we are–BONG! BONG! BONG!–out of our element."

In [Root.GetName], a once quiet and peaceful community has been disturbed by sightings of what seem to be "flying gongs." The locals find themselves increasingly agitated as these gongs hover over their villages, and speculations abound about visitors from other realms. While the notion of extrahallanial beings might appear absurd and somewhat foolish, the conviction remains strong among many in [Root.GetName] that an otherworldly visitation is on the horizon. In response, they have begun constructing sky shrines, hoping to appease these supposed outsiders with offerings of jewelry, gemstones, and other opulent items. Nevertheless, we suspect that these sightings and "visits" are nothing more than deceptive spirits, toying with the locals. One approach could involve assisting the residents in increasing their offerings, with the hope of placating the spirits and persuading them to depart. Alternatively, some may consider attempting to shoot down these flying gongs from the sky."

People are being randomly struck by little pebbles, yet no one has witnessed anyone throwing them. While these attacks haven't resulted in fatalities, they have engendered a pervasive sense of paranoia among the local populace, disrupting their daily activities. After dismissing the possibility of mischievous children being behind these incidents, the local magistrate suspects the involvement of a taunting spirit—one that might be shapeless, skilled at concealment, or even embodied within the stones themselves. The magistrate seeks permission to gather these stones and relocate them to a secure place, hoping that this action might put an end to the attacks."
 spirits.115.a:0 "No we are not going to "arrest a bunch of rocks.""

 spirits.116.da:0 "Local leaders in [Root.GetName] have been sharing reports and rumors about a peculiar creature—a monkey/man hybrid—that has been sighted, coinciding with the unexplained disappearances of individuals who ventured out at night. According to a local hunter, who claims to have survived an encounter with this hybrid, it hides behind foliage, using an irresistible smile to lure its victims closer. Once within reach, the creature swiftly strikes its victims with a rock, dragging the bodies away, leaving no trace behind. Attempts to eliminate it using conventional weapons such as spears, swords, or arrows have proven futile, as they seem unable to harm the creature in any way. The hunter referred to this entity as a "Huo Guai," translating to 'ghost monkey,' and the local community implores [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to take action. The mages have identified it as a spirit, advising that spirit hunters, though expensive, should be engaged to deal with the situation if a resolution is desired."

This spirit has chosen the town square as its abode and willingly engages in conversations with the townspeople, generously dispensing advice and wisdom to all who seek it. The Blue Man presents an imposing figure, towering over three meters in height, and adorned with nothing more than a simple waist sash. Its distinctive features include glowing blue skin and a semi-transparent body, earning it the local moniker, "the Blue Man."\n\nAmong the local peasants, the Blue Man is revered and cherished for its insight, believed to bestow divine protection and bring good fortune. However, the noble class holds a contrasting view, voicing concerns that the longer this spirit remains in the village, the greater the risk of it undermining their authority to rule."

So much so that the expression "Being a Diajinyuan'' has become synonymous with someone exceptionally gifted in money-making endeavors. Despite the widespread familiarity with this fable, one would expect that nobody would fall for the monkey's alluring proposition. Nevertheless, history has proven itself once again.

However, this year's harvest presents an unusual twist, with the leaves displaying a mild pink glow and many exhibiting red veins. What's even stranger is the effect it seems to have on people. Those who come into contact with these peculiar leaves become notably more amiable and affectionate, seeking physical closeness with one another.\n\nThe mages speculate that a benevolent spirit has bestowed this enigmatic blessing upon the harvest, though the exact reason remains a mystery to them.

However, yesterday, a few magpies or spirits disguised as magpies proved to be a distraction for some guards. These ethereal beings enticed the guards with promises of wealth and led them to a small cave, where their word proved to be true—the cave was filled with riches beyond measure.\n\nRemarkably, it appears that these spirits had no malicious intentions towards our guards. Instead, they acted with honesty, delivering on their promise. The guards have dutifully brought the treasure to our attention and have suggested that we find a way to show gratitude to these "magpies" for their benevolence."

The village's population has been growing unexpectedly, not due to a baby boom or any foreseeable reason, but rather due to the unexplained arrival of random individuals. These newcomers have no recollection of their origins or identities and appear disoriented, seeking refuge and assistance. The compassionate village has extended its aid and shelter to these bewildered souls.\n\nThe only telltale sign of their arrival is a faint whispering in the wind. Given the spiritual nature of this occurrence, it is in our best interest to offer support and care to these newly arrived inhabitants. Allocating our resources to help settle and accommodate them seems like the most prudent course of action at this time."

 spirits.122.d:0 "It all began innocently enough, with a few people seemingly enjoying themselves, but soon enough, the mirthful phenomenon expanded to engulf an entire street, then a village, and eventually an entire town. Evidently, this affliction spreads through sound, as the mere act of hearing those already affected is enough to overcome even the most somber and despondent individuals, compelling them to descend into uncontrollable laughter—their final laughter.\n\nThis laughing plague, likely instigated by a malevolent spirit, is spreading with alarming speed throughout [Root.GetName]. In response, we have dispatched medical experts, but tragically, even they fell prey to the infectious merriment. As a measure of containment, our troops have taken swift action, sealing off the affected regions hermetically and plugging their ears with beeswax and cotton to prevent any external sounds from reaching them. Though uncertain of the outcome, this method has, for the time being, curbed the spread of laughter, which, like those it infected, seems to be dying out."

Upon awakening, they are greeted by the disconcerting sight of a shadowy, elephantine figure cast upon the walls of their homes. This ominous phenomenon is a telltale sign that a Baku has set its sights on preying upon the dreams of the populace, and their suffering will persist until this malevolent entity chooses to depart."
 spirits.123.a:0 "I hope that a nice cup of tea will calm them a bit."
 spirits.124.t:0 "Baku, Eater of Nightmares"
 spirits.124.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetName] have been sharing remarkable accounts of feeling blessed by the spirits, awakening each day with renewed vitality and without any troubling dreams. This phenomenon is likely the result of a benevolent Baku having chosen to make its abode in the region. Though these beings are typically indiscriminate in their consumption of dreams, this particular one appears to have developed a fondness for the people and has assumed a protective role, at least for the present."

Crops now seem to grow almost instantaneously, bearing more fruit and grain than ever before.

The population fears that they have incurred the visitation of Tuiziye, the spirit of insects.

Then, just as quickly as they arrived, they vanished into the night. We do not know why these beasts have chosen to attack us, or if they will return."

 spirits.151.d:0 "A dull, everpresent fog has settled over [Root.GetName], shrouding the land with a feeling of dread. Voices whisper in the mist, speaking of old ills yet to be undone, muttering of vengeance. Our guards in the region have reported familiar faces on the figures that walk within, old comrades slain in battle, great leaders from our nation’s past, all bearing the grisly wounds of war. While our own people have remained unmolested by these spirits, our strategists believe that our foes might not be quite so lucky should they intrude into the mists."

 spirits.152.d:0 ""Bang Ba di will be back, put bad children in a bag, Bang Ba di will find all of ye, and put you into the bags, one of three."\n\nThe chilling rhyme of "Bang Ba di" and its various versions have long been known to most children in Haless. Traditionally, it served as a folk tale used by parents to scare misbehaving children into better behavior. However, to the dismay of the community, it seems that this rhyme has now manifested itself into a haunting reality. A spirit has taken on the persona of the folktale and is abducting children indiscriminately, regardless of their conduct or character. This alarming situation has instilled deep fear among parents, who worry that their own children might be the next victims of this mysterious entity."
 spirits.152.a:0 "Bang Ba Di will not take just one, but eventually he will be gone..."
 spirits.153.t:0 "Blessing from the Grandmother spirit"
 spirits.153.d:0 "Haless, a continent characterized by its diverse spiritual and ritual practices, displays a shared reverence and respect for grandmothers, who hold a special place as the mothers of mothers. This collective veneration is expressed through various means, including rituals, storytelling, and unique traditions. For instance, in a group of hamlets nestled deep within the Lupulan rainforest, the ashes of deceased women are mixed into farming soil, symbolically giving birth to nourishment for younger generations. Similarly, the Phokhao sky cemeteries honor deceased grandmothers by mummifying them in the cold air and regularly offering food, flowers, liquor, and other goods to their spirits, ensuring they watch over future generations.\n\nSamshimoni, a revered spirit representing these venerated grandmothers, has been frequently sighted around cemeteries, ancestral shrines, and spiritual centers. The common people's devoted reverence has been reciprocated, as witnessed in the province of [Root.GetName]. The area has experienced a significant surge in pregnancies and healthy births, coinciding with an increased number of encounters with the Grandmother spirit. Consequently, the population of the province is growing, providing us with more people to recruit and engage in various activities, contributing to the prosperity of the region."

 spirits.154.t:0 "Corrupted by Mara"
 spirits.154.d:0 "Rulers are akin to sheperds, while governors take on the role of sheepdogs, responsible for guiding and protecting the flock without causing harm. However, the unfortunate reality in [Root.GetName] is that our governor has proven to be more akin to a rabid dog, attacking the very flock it was meant to safeguard. This individual has engaged in embezzlement, illicit deals with local gang syndicates, and misappropriated state funds for personal gain. Clearly, we must replace the governor to restore integrity and trust in leadership.\n\nYet, we must also recognize that recovering the stolen funds may prove challenging, if not impossible. Our suspicions are that the governor acted under the influence of a malevolent spirit named Mara, who thrives on corrupting and manipulating the righteous into committing wicked deeds. This belief is bolstered by reports from the governor's own staff, who observed a dark, ominous glow in his eyes and noticed severe sleep deprivation over the past weeks."
 spirits.154.a:0 "Replace the governor, and please get him some help."
 spirits.155.t:0 "Blessed by Cao Bao"
 spirits.155.d:0 "While Haless is well-known for its focus on good stewardship and the necessity of a strong and honorable bureaucracy, humans are still humans. They can and will sometimes be corrupt or greedy, whether due to debts to pay or simply because they crave more and more. The result is the same: the state loses money and standing. However, sometimes we receive help in fighting the eternal sickness called corruption, and it comes from the divine, no less.\n\nOur administration in [Root.GetName] was shocked when the local governor disappeared without a trace. Initially, we suspected that he took off with the local treasury, but the opposite appears to be true. When the new governor inspected the office, he discovered a secret small room filled with hoarded treasure. It seems that the former governor was not acting alone, as within the small room, there was a strange shrine with offerings to Cao Bao, a spirit known to possess people who pray for debt relief and then force them into becoming treasure hoarders. Sadly, what people do not realize is that Cao Bao takes what it wants randomly, and sometimes it is the literal life of the person who called upon them in the first place, as seems to have happened with the governor. All that remains is the question of what to do with the remaining treasure."

 spirits.156.d:0 "Our spymaster stormed into our ruler’s office, bringing with them a shocking revelation: they are receiving information about our rivals from a spirit. We are unsure why this is happening, but it all began with faint voices emanating from some opera masks. Gradually, the communication evolved into clear revelations of secrets that we could not have possibly uncovered ourselves. Eventually, the spirit started disclosing full-blown state secrets about our rivals and neighbors—information only a ruler or their closest servants would possess.\n\nOur spymaster is clueless about why these whisperers are aiding us, but upon thorough investigation by our spies, we have confirmed that the information they provide is true. The only problem lies in our uncertainty about whether these spirits are also aiding our rivals."

 spirits.157.t:0 "The Craving of the Caterpillar"
 spirits.157.d:0 "Many cultures speak of a spirit or ghost that leads people, especially men, to their doom. One such Halessi legend is that of the Maokohnu, short for "The Good Caterpillar Lady." The Maokohnu is a malicious spirit who ensnares married men with her singing and lures them into the forest, never to be seen again. It remains unclear whether they are consumed or used for procreation. However, what is known is that to men, she appears as a beautiful singing lady, while to unmarried men and women, she takes on the form of a gigantic screeching caterpillar with the face of an old hag.\n\nIn a village in [Root.GetName], the Maokohnu has struck, causing a disaster. It all began with a night of disappearances when over twenty men vanished from their homes, walking straight across the rice fields and into the local forest while calling for "The Good Lady." A few people attempted to stop them, but as they neared the forest and the Maokohnu, the faint screeching turned into loud and unbearable screams. The following morning, a search party was dispatched. They scoured the forest but found no trace of the spirit or the missing men. Only after hours of searching did they stumble upon something—a small cave. Inside, they discovered bones clad in torn clothing, covered with what seemed to be wet silk string. They left the cave hastily but took some of the cloth as evidence. Upon returning to the village, their suspicions were confirmed: the clothing belonged to some of the husbands.\n\nWith no trace of the husbands other than the cave's findings, the village sought help from the state. The local governor dispatched a small group of soldiers to investigate the cave further. While they did find more clothing and bones, they found no living soul or any trace of the Maokohnu. At a loss for what to do next, the local governor reached out to us to deliver the news and inquire if monetary support for the widows is possible. Although highly unusual, the governor deems it necessary, as the village lost a significant portion of its working population to the spirit."
 spirits.157.a:0 "Compensate the widows, it’s the least we can do..."
 spirits.158.t:0 "High Visit"
 spirits.158.d:0 "At the funeral of the village elder, mourners noticed an unexpected occurrence—far more people attended the service than were officially invited. This, in itself, is not unusual, as funerals often serve as social gatherings for communities, allowing people from [Root.GetName] to mourn together. However, what stunned everyone was the sheer number of guests who came to pay their respects. A procession of unfamiliar faces graced the event, many clad in clothing styles that belonged to decades, and sometimes even centuries, past.\n\nOnly a few days later did the realization dawn upon the people. Ancestral spirits from across the lands had arrived to honor their departed elder. Generations upon generations of ancestors had gathered to be present. Such an unprecedented visit from our forebears has left the people of [Root.GetName] feeling emboldened and comforted. The knowledge that their ancestors continue to watch over them brings solace and reassurance."

 spirits.159.t:0 "Cave Ghost"
 spirits.159.d:0 "In [Root.GetName], mushroom collecting is usually undertaken by children. So, when a little girl emerged from the forest, screaming that she had seen an ogre, half the village rallied, arming themselves with weapons and farm equipment to confront and slay the presumed monster. However, they soon discovered that scythes and pikes could take down a physical ogre, but they proved utterly useless against the apparition of one. Any attempts at reasoning with the ghost were futile, as it spoke a long-forgotten variant of the old Oni language and flew into a rage whenever anyone ventured into the mushroom clearing."

 spirits.160.d:0 "The first encounter happened when an old lady was cooking, and her supposedly deceased husband walked into the kitchen. He casually took some rice cakes and proceeded to the porch, where he enjoyed some tea with his old buddies, just as he used to do daily when alive. The lady screamed in fear and rushed to her neighbors, who were equally shocked, not just by their neighbor's experience but also because their great-grandfather, recognizable by his military uniform, appeared in their house, meticulously cleaning his armor as if preparing for some drill.\n\nAs days went by, more and more of these encounters were reported, and what made them even stranger was that all these "walking dead" acknowledged their supposed death but acted as if their return was entirely normal. We remain clueless about their intentions or what can be done, and it might be best to let them be for now."

 spirits.161.d:0 "Many Halessi fishing villages are strategically situated in the middle of lakes or large rivers, providing easy access to fishing grounds and offering substantial protection. However, this protection is sometimes compromised by roaming bandits on boats and ships who exploit and harass these vulnerable villages, as the authorities either lack the will or capability to intervene. Such an incident occurred in a small lake village in [Root.GetName].\n\nWhen the local authorities failed to come to their aid, a spirit in the form of a pale lady emerged to assist the village. Adorned in white robes and a wide-brimmed hat, she bore bright red tattoos on her skin. Employing some form of elemental powers, the spirit lady confronted the bandits, forcing many of them, who couldn't swim, into the water and causing the bandit lord to meet his demise, drowning aboard his large Junk ship. Other bandits who sought vengeance and attempted to reach the village also met fatal ends.\n\nLocal authorities have refrained from visiting the village, fearing that the spirit may hold a grudge against them as well. However, it can be stated with certainty that any form of banditry in [Root.GetName] has been quelled, at least for the time being."

 spirits.162.d:0 "In [Root.GetName], a spirit known as Orang Minyak has recently emerged, taking the form of a man covered in black oil. This malevolent entity has been launching attacks and abducting people, with young women being the primary targets. These attacks occur during the night when most people are asleep. Orang Minyak seems to possess the uncanny ability to elude patrols and guards by moving silently on walls and ceilings.\n\nThe spirit incapacitates its victims by dripping oil into their mouths, causing them to fall into a coma-like state, and then carries them away into the darkness. Although most of the abducted individuals eventually return, they are deeply traumatized and refuse to communicate with anyone. Our suspicions about the intentions of this oily man are unclear, and as of now, there is no apparent solution to put an end to these horrifying attacks. The villagers remain frightened and uncertain about how to protect themselves from this malevolent force."

 spirits.164.d:0 "For over a week, a chilling spectacle has haunted [Root.GetName]. At sunset, headless horsemen emerge from the depths of the forests, galloping through the streets. These terrifying apparitions don jet black armor, their bodies mere wisps of smoke. Strangely, they seem incapable of causing physical harm, as reports suggest they pass right through people without any tangible impact. Nevertheless, the terror they instill in the residents is genuine, leaving them demanding urgent action to expel these ghostly figures from the forest.\n\nThe fear and anxiety gripping the village have reached a breaking point, as the eerie nightly visits persist. The community seeks respite and a solution to end the haunting. The enigmatic appearance and seemingly intangible nature of these headless horsemen have left everyone perplexed, and they yearn for a way to bring peace back to their lives."

They looted treasures, killed most of the inhabitants, and inflicted unspeakable atrocities upon them. Just before the woman met her own tragic end, she vowed to seek vengeance against all who served and took innocent lives. Now, it appears that her spirit indeed seeks retribution, but driven by fury, she is indiscriminately targeting every young serving man, even those who have not caused harm to others. We find ourselves powerless to halt this spirit's actions, left only to hope that her thirst for vengeance will eventually be satisfied or that she will move on to another place. The village remains in fear, unsure of how to alleviate the haunting presence of this tormented soul."

These eerie lights are infamous for one malevolent purpose: reanimating the dead from their graves, unleashing havoc upon the living. The reasons and mechanisms behind this sinister phenomenon remain shrouded in mystery. When Kubikay sightings occur, disaster is imminent, as the deceased rise from their tombs and launch indiscriminate attacks on people.\n\nIn [Root.GetName], such an alarming event unfolded, prompting the locals to urgently seek aid from the nearby garrison. However, the magnitude of the undead force was overwhelming, surpassing what a local garrison could combat. As a result, regions within the province are being evacuated hastily to prevent the scourge from spreading to other areas. Swift action is of utmost importance, for every victim of the Kubikay becomes one of these malevolent spirits, further swelling the ranks of this dreadful army of the dead. Time is of the essence, and we must act decisively before this rotting legion of death engulfs more provinces."

 spirits.167.d:0 "Harpies are an uncommon sight in the Xianjie, and many may never encounter one in their entire lives. Nonetheless, everyone is familiar with the tale of Blackfang, a story passed down to children to instill a clear lesson. Legend has it that Blackfang served as a guardian of a small shrine in [Root.GetName] until an angry mob, fueled by baseless accusations of baby-eating, ended her life. The truth of these allegations is highly doubtful, but the outcome was tragically real. According to the lore, Blackfang's spirit now roams the Xianjie, seeking retribution against those who falsely accuse others of crimes they did not commit. While many consider this tale a cautionary fable, it seems that Blackfang has manifested herself in [Root.GetName].\n\nA notoriously unpopular magistrate, known for making false accusations and sentencing locals to boost personal revenue, met a gruesome fate. Snatched by a harpy adorned with dark green wings, black claws, and fangs, the magistrate was dropped from an astonishing height of around 100 meters onto the pavement of a bustling townsquare. The impact turned the once-corrupt magistrate into a puddle of remains, leaving no doubt about the severity of the strike. In the aftermath, Blackfang swiftly flew away.\n\nDespite the sudden and brutal nature of the attack, the locals have not shied away from showing their gratitude. Offerings have been left at a local shrine to honor and thank the spirit for her actions. While some may view it as a mere tale, the occurrence in [Root.GetName] has sparked belief in the vengeful presence of Blackfang. Her legendary pursuit of justice against false accusations seems to have manifested in a truly unsettling manner, sending a powerful message that resonates with the people."

In this regard, the province of [Root.GetName] appears to excel, being renowned for its blessed and contented couples. Many in the region proudly assert that their love has grown and deepened with the passage of time. This exceptional state of affairs is widely attributed to the benevolent influence of the lovespirit Yueklao. It is believed that Yueklao actively works to nurture and strengthen relationships, resulting in a robust social fabric and enduring bonds among the people of [Root.GetName].\n\nThe presence of Yueklao's favor is evident in the flourishing love and unity that permeate the province.

Regrettably, in [Root.GetName], this has become more of a norm than an exception, and suspicions point towards the involvement of the spirit called Yueklao. Though formless, Yueklao is known to wield influence over people's relationships and behaviors, both in positive and negative ways. Unfortunately, it appears that [Root.GetName] has experienced the negative consequences, with people now engaging in adultery almost openly.\n\nThis epidemic of infidelity is wreaking havoc on the province, tearing apart the social fabric and undermining its core values and norms. The widespread indulgence in adultery is profoundly damaging to the community, leading to fractured relationships, broken trust, and emotional turmoil.

Our ruler has taken such a path, attempting to forge a pact with Ngoho, a spirit renowned in tales for bestowing immortality upon those who seek it.\n\nThe ceremony was conducted with great solemnity, involving ritual chanting by shamans and the burning of incense. In the midst of this sacred atmosphere, our ruler fervently called upon the spirit to grant them immortality. The room fell into a profound silence, and abruptly, all light vanished, replaced by a faint murmuring. During this moment of uncertainty, our ruler collapsed to the ground, while the shamans continued their chant.\n\nA few seconds later, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] regained consciousness seemingly unchanged.

During this mysterious interlude, our ruler collapsed to the ground, while the shamans continued their chant.\n\nAfter a few seconds, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] regained consciousness but complained of a powerful and sharp headache. The significance of this symptom remains uncertain, leaving us to ponder whether it heralds a foreshadowing of impending death or if our ruler narrowly escaped the clutches of mortality.

She offered them a broth with the delightful aroma of venison and flowers, undoubtedly a soothing remedy. Despite any attempts to stop her, she appeared both physically and figuratively unyielding, determined to fulfill her compassionate mission.\n\nGratitude and reverence filled the village as they recognized the divine intervention of Pyolsong and their ancestors.

As a consequence, nearly all the villagers fell ill with the pox, leaving them in a dire and desperate state.\n\nThe gravity of the situation necessitated urgent action, prompting the dispatch of the army to quarantine the province and prevent any further outbreak. Now, the fate of the villagers rests on the hands of time and the power of prayer. The once serene village now stands in the shadow of a dark and uncertain future, as they grapple with the devastating consequences of Pyolsong's wrathful visit.

Moreover, the spirit of Vanyara, the protector of merchants, is known to employ punishment as a means to address a wide range of misdeeds related to fair trade and honest dealings.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the province of [Root.GetName] seems to be facing such challenges. An alarming rise in quacksalvers has emerged, comprising fake doctors, dentists, faulty tool salesmen, and spice merchants peddling colored sand. This proliferation has caused significant financial strain as we endeavor to suppress these dishonest traders and provide compensation to those who have suffered due to their deceitful practices.\n\nThere are strong suspicions that Vanyara's influence may be at play in this distressing situation. Many of the quacksalvers we apprehended were once well-known and respected merchants who now express remorse for their unlawful activities, attributing their transgressions to the influence of the Vanyaras. This complex predicament calls for a concerted effort to restore integrity and ethics in trade within the province.

Although mostly invisible, Preta occasionally takes on the form of either a malnourished noble or a plump peasant. Tragically, many have already succumbed to this affliction, and we fear more will perish in the days to come.\n\nInterestingly, it seems that Preta's impact is confined to a specific area, as those who have left the affected region regain their ability to eat.

Remarkably, our nation has now been touched by Phi Am's influence, and our citizens and soldiers feel revitalized and rejuvenated every single morning. The overall discipline of our people has significantly improved, and our nation is now well-rested. Let us hope that Phi Am remains with us for a considerable time, so we may continue to enjoy peaceful and refreshing slumbers."

 spirits.200.d:0 "Monkeys are well-known thieves in the villages, but the Rending has brought a more troublesome issue to the people of [Root.GetName]: Spirit Monkeys. Catching these thieving primates was already a tough task, but now they've gained the strange ability to turn solid whenever they want. This means they can easily slip through walls and barriers, making their thievery even more vexing for the folks in [Root.GetName]."

 spirits.201.d:0 "Spirits are roaming all across our nation, from our cities to our fields. While many of these spirits are peaceful and content in their nature, there are some who are filled with malice and evil intent. These malevolent spirits have been committing gruesome acts, murdering innocent civilians, draining their bodies of blood, and leaving their corpses turned inside out. It is imperative that these malevolent spirits are hunted down and banished from the mortal plane to protect our people."
 spirits.201.a:0 "They will leave in time."
 spirits.201.b:0 "Hunt them down!"
 spirits.202.t:0 "The Howling Sea"
 spirits.202.d:0 "It began as faint whispers on the winds, just a hint of something unusual. Gradually, it grew louder, evolving into a peculiar, eerie, and haunting howl. These sounds predominantly occur during heavy fog, storms, or at night, and those who hear them are overwhelmed by dread, fear, and an overwhelming sense of impending doom. The stories of the howling sea have become so frequent that many sailors now refuse to venture into our waters during adverse conditions or overnight, fearing these unsettling phenomena."

 spirits.203.t:0 "The Blue Mist"
 spirits.203.d:0 "Our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] has been confronted this morning with a deeply puzzling and distressing barrage of reports. Citizens from all corners of our nation are converging in great numbers to report an unusual phenomenon: a strange blue mist descending upon our land. They insist that this thick mist is obscuring the sun, plunging our cities into darkness, and causing the crops in our fields to wither and perish."
 spirits.203.a:0 "The spirits have cursed us!"
 spirits.204.t:0 "The Red Mist"
 spirits.204.d:0 "Our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] has been confronted this morning with a most bewildering and unsettling series of reports. Citizens from all corners of our nation are coming forward in large numbers to describe an unusual occurrence: a strange red mist spreading across our land. While this dense red haze is disconcerting to witness, the sun continues to shine through, and the mist appears to be promoting the growth of plants wherever it settles!"
 spirits.204.a:0 "The spirits have blessed us!"
 spirits.205.t:0 "The Hungry Ghosts"
 spirits.205.d:0 "The Spirit Festival in [Root.GetName] was in full swing when, at dusk, a sizable gathering of spirits arrived. However, these were not benevolent spirits; instead, they were brimming with hunger and malevolence. These voracious spirits have initiated a rampage through the town, sowing chaos and spreading panic and fear among the residents. Our councilors are urgently calling for decisive action to be taken!"
 spirits.205.a:0 "We must drive these spirits back!"

 spirits.206.d:0 "A spirit has recently presented itself at court, proposing to serve as an advisor to the state! They assert that they have existed as a spirit for over a thousand years and assert that they once served as an advisor to Harimar himself. Within our court, there is a significant divide on this matter. Some dismiss these claims as nonsensical, arguing that a spirit should not hold such a high-ranking position. Conversely, there are those who believe that the spirit's wisdom could greatly benefit our state. Additionally, rumors are circulating about a faction that advocates for this spirit to assume leadership over our state. This internal conflict has now reached a critical juncture, and a decision must be made."
 spirits.206.a:0 "Hire them!"

In the place of the once-rolling hills and meadows, colossal stone statues now tower with their arms raised and hands forming a warding gesture! These monumental figures dwarf most sentient beings, and children have eagerly started climbing them. Meanwhile, other citizens describe an odd but reassuring sense of security bestowed by the presence of these guardians."
 spirits.207.a:0 "These great guardians shall protect us!"
 spirits.208.t:0 "Sword Spirit"
 spirits.208.d:0 ""Huzah, thou cowardly rapscallion of a human! Thy end will be one more victory for mine glorious string of victories! Non-corporeal or ethereal has beaten me, and the wheels of luck have made it impossible so…" the spirit exclaims with an aura of arrogance and confidence. This peculiar duelist, who appears as a finely dressed merchant armed with an even fancier sword, has been challenging individuals to lethal duels. Those "challenged," or more accurately selected, are given roughly two minutes to prepare and arm themselves before the spirit initiates the attack. Whether the person wishes to engage in combat or not makes no difference, as this Sword Spirit will only taunt those who refuse to duel before dispatching them.\n\n"Stand and fight like a man, thou fool! Get up and show me that thou art worthy of mine blade!" After defeating the opponent and boasting about the victory to onlookers, the spirit proceeds to suspend the corpse by its hair through magical means, leaving the family and locals unable to remove it for some inexplicable reason. Following this gruesome display, the Sword Spirit departs, deriding the village population as weak and pathetic, declaring them "unworthy of the Sword!" People live in constant dread of the spirit discovering them and issuing a challenge, knowing that it means certain death. They are demanding that we take action, and we believe we have the means to do so."
 spirits.208.a:0 "I shall face it in a duel myself!"

These spirits are adorned in robes of white and gold, and their luminance emanates an otherworldly radiance. The purpose behind their arrival and the reason for their march across our lands remain shrouded in mystery, with each account of the parade presenting a unique narrative. However, what is indisputable is the pride our people feel in the presence of these enigmatic beings."

 spirits.210.d:0 "In our relentless pursuit of success on this plane, it appears we have incurred damage to our khartaya, as a devastating plague of monstrous entities has descended upon our lands. These abominations manifest in a myriad of horrifying forms and sizes, ranging from grotesque, diminutive grey creatures to humans and harimari, twisted and disfigured to the point of almost being unrecognizable. These beings now parade through our nation in a nightmarish procession, instilling terror in the populace, who have come to believe that we are cursed!"
 spirits.210.a:0 "We must remain calm!"
 spirits.211.t:0 "March of Expanding Apathy"
 spirits.211.d:0 "Ghosts have become a common sight since the onset of this "spirit tide," especially in the vicinity of damaged and ruined high temples. These apparitions are typically pale blue or white, although sightings of other hues such as red and yellow have been reported. They appear with a faint aura, taking the shape of sentient species. However, recent sightings have brought attention to grey, shapeless apparitions haunting our state. These ghosts evoke feelings of dread, unease, and weariness among our people. Whatever their nature, it is evident that these entities are not entirely benign spirits."
 spirits.211.a:0 "What are those... things?"
 spirits.212.t:0 "March of Burgeoning Fervour"
 spirits.212.d:0 "A vast multitude of yellow and red spirits has been observed moving through our country in a magnificent parade.

 spirits.213.d:0 "It may sound like a story told to children to ensure their good behavior, but the grim reality is undeniable. Sinister masks, taking the shape of individuals' deepest fears, have started manifesting in their rooms during the night, casting ominous shadows over their homes. These horrifying spirits are malevolent and brimming with malice, seemingly deriving pleasure from tormenting the living. The relentless torment inflicted by these nightmarish apparitions is driving those affected to the brink of insanity, with dire consequences for their mental well-being."

 spirits.214.t:0 "Dances of Ecstacy"
 spirits.214.d:0 "A unique spirit has made its presence known in [Root.GetName], distinct from many others we have encountered. Reports from the province describe how this spirit is compelling the people to engage in vigorous dancing, even individuals of advanced age or limited mobility. They dance fervently for hours after nightfall before eventually falling asleep in the late hours of the night. Remarkably, the following day, these individuals express a profound sense of revitalization and motivation. It appears that the spirited dance has bestowed upon them renewed energy and a revived zest for life."

 spirits.214.b:0 "Where are my dancing shoes?"
 spirits.215.t:0 "Dance Till Death"
 spirits.215.d:0 "A peculiar spirit has made its presence known in [Root.GetName], unlike many others we have encountered. Reports from the province reveal that this spirit is compelling the people to dance with great intensity, including those who are elderly or have limited mobility. They dance relentlessly for hours after dusk, without pause as the hours pass. Tragically, those unfortunate souls afflicted by this spirit continue to dance for days on end until they eventually collapse from sheer exhaustion. Despite our best efforts, they cannot be revived, as their souls have been cruelly torn from Halann by this malevolent spirit."
 spirits.215.a:0 "A dance with death, a terrible tragedy."
 spirits.216.t:0 "Sound of Silence"
 spirits.216.d:0 "You woke up and got out of bed, just like any other day, but something felt amiss. As you emerged from your slumber, you noticed an eerie silence. There were no birds chirping, even though it was dawn. The wind chimes in the garden were still, despite feeling the breeze on your face. There was no sound coming from the rest of the residential complex, even though it should have been a bustling morning. Then, as you scratched an itch, it struck you that the absence of sound was because you couldn't hear anything.\n\nShocked and terrified, you screamed for the guards, but they did not respond. When you stormed out of your room in fear and anger, there were no guards, maids, or servants in the hallways. Suddenly, a sweaty hand touched you, causing you to recoil. It was the First Minister, who handed you a note that read: "Since last night, the entire city seems to have gone deaf, including you, me, and even the animals."\n\nIn a state of panic, you gathered your advisors and generals for a meeting conducted in deafening silence. You passed notes to each other to communicate. News arrived that the entire nation was affected, and chaos was erupting. Although the common folk were screaming for an explanation and action, you suspected that spirits were at play and that increasing devotion was the key. However, how could you convey this message when more than half of the population couldn't read, write, or hear?\n\nFurthermore, how could you explain that sacrifices and prayers needed to intensify? This operation would undoubtedly cost a fortune, and as your nation descended into chaos, your enemies might seize the opportunity. You knew that quick action was essential, and while it might be expensive, it could also save your nation."
 spirits.216.a:0 "Send messengers to explain with hand signals. We need sacrifices!"
 spirits.216.b:0 "Send the army to every corner of the nation. We need offerings!"
 spirits.216.c:0 "Send leaflets, let us hope the peasants can read."
 spirits.250.t:0 "The Nightingale Sings!"
 spirits.250.d:0 "You wake up and step out of bed just like any other day, but something feels different. You can hear it, yes, hear a nightingale singing. Shocked and fearing that you might be going mad, you walk to the balcony, and there it is – the nightingale, perched atop a tree, serenading the morning. You hear wind chimes tinkling in the breeze, and when you scratch an itch, you hear the faint sound of your nails against your skin.\n\nOverwhelmed with joy, you let out an almost deafening scream of happiness and rush out of the room, finding your guards with smiles on their faces. They too have regained their hearing. You make your way to the First Minister, who can hear again as well, and it appears that everybody in the nation has regained their hearing.\n\nThe nightmare is finally over, whether through increased piety or sheer luck, it doesn't matter. The nightingale sings again, and the world is filled with the beautiful sounds of life."
 spirits.250.a:0 "It is over, it is finally over..."
 spirits.217.t:0 "Jellywave"
 spirits.217.d:0 "Seasonal occurrences of dead jellyfish washing up on the shores in Haless are not uncommon, serving as reliable indicators of seasonal changes and shifts in water temperatures. However, this time, something is amiss – they emit a putrid odor. It all commenced with an unusually large influx of jellyfish washing ashore, followed by even more, and more. The stench is overwhelming, a foul and pungent aroma of salt permeates the coastal air, sometimes even reaching inland when the winds blow westward.\n\nThis noxious smell is making people sick and sluggish, disrupting daily life along the coast. It compounds the pollution of the beaches and the threats posed by highly venomous jellyfish species like the Cobalt Dragon and the Feiten Great Junk to those who accidentally come into contact with them. It is suspected that an angered ocean spirit may be behind these occurrences, and decisions must be made regarding how to address the situation – whether through appeasement or alternative measures."
 spirits.217.a:0 "Increase the cleanup attempts of the beaches until the spirit calms down."
 spirits.217.b:0 "We must make more sacrifices to ocean based shrines and hope the spirit will be appeased."

 spirits.218.d:0 "Fish is a dietary staple throughout Haless, with its rivers and coastal cities offering a wide array of fresh and saltwater varieties across all regions. It constitutes a cornerstone of the Halessi diet, but now, a potential calamity looms. Fishermen in [Root.GetName] have reported a troubling phenomenon: every fish they catch begins to rot the moment it leaves the water and lands on their hooks. This predicament threatens to unleash disaster, as the absence of a fish harvest could leave many without a reliable source of sustenance.\n\nThe exact cause of this issue remains unknown, although locals in the region suspect it may be the result of an angered water spirit reacting out of unexplained resentment. Regardless of the cause, we must address this matter urgently, as the consequences of a fish shortage would be devastating for the population of [Root.GetName]. Decisive action is imperative to mitigate the situation, as any delay could lead to more people suffering from starvation."
 spirits.218.a:0 "Provide a grain dole to the affected province and wait it out."
 spirits.218.b:0 "Increase sacrifices to the water spirits and hope they are appeased."
 spirits.218.c:0 "Leave them to their fate, we can’t afford to help them."
 spirits.219.t:0 "Black Blight"
 spirits.219.d:0 "Reports from [Root.GetName] have reached the court of [Root.Owner.GetName], delivering chilling accounts from frightened survivors that paint a bleak and haunting picture. A plague has descended upon the land, manifesting as a foul and putrid black mold that clings to everything it touches. Those unfortunate enough to be afflicted by this mold are driven to madness within a matter of days, seemingly beyond the reach of reason or sanity. The horrifying spread of this affliction has prompted people to flee the region in large numbers, desperate to avoid succumbing to the same dire fate that has befallen their friends and family.\n\nThe suspected cause of this calamity is a dark and malevolent spirit, seemingly intent on spreading misery throughout the land to compel us to take action. While confronting this entity directly would be reckless, ignoring the situation could prove disastrous for the region. Within the court, opinions diverge on how to proceed. Some vehemently oppose the idea of bargaining with the spirit, viewing it as a corrupt and malevolent force that must be eradicated. Ultimately, the decision lies with the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle], and there is no clear-cut solution to this dire situation. However, a choice must be made, for time is of the essence."
 spirits.219.a:0 "Attack this foul existence and expunge it from this plane."

 spirits.220.t:0 "Harvest Festival"
 spirits.220.d:0 "Spirits, by their very nature, are capricious entities, often changing their whims at a moment's notice. This trait can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on the outcome. Unfortunately, we find ourselves in the latter situation, as an unpredictable Nature spirit has demanded the initiation of a festival. This festival is to celebrate the bountiful harvest from the previous season, and under normal circumstances, it would pose no issue – just host a celebration and move forward. However, this is not a typical situation. The mercurial nature of spirits dictates that they have demanded a sacrifice to be an integral part of this grand celebration, as a means of honoring the prosperity they have brought to our realm.\n\nThis has, unsurprisingly, stirred controversy within the court of [Root.Owner.GetName]. Many have called for a violent response to this demand, but such action would likely lead to a disastrous backlash from the spirits, potentially devastating our harvest. Consequently, it has been decided that a sacrifice must be made, though there is still debate over who should be offered. The [Root.Owner.GetTitle] might offer themselves to the spirit, or the heir could be considered, or even the life of a virgin woman, chosen from our population. None of these options are ideal, but we cannot evade the issue and expect it to resolve itself. A decision must be made, however unenviable it may be."
 spirits.220.a:0 "I shall be the sacrifice."

 spirits.221.t:0 "No More Lost"
 spirits.221.d:0 "As the rending commenced and the spirits began to manifest in the physical world, the believers of the Godlost faith initially dismissed these occurrences as mere illusions or elaborate tricks performed by Halessi and Raheni mages. They viewed it as a deliberate attempt to discredit their deeply held beliefs. However, as the days turned into weeks and then months, doubts began to creep into the minds of even the most devout followers of the Godlost faith.\n\nThe undeniable presence of spirits actively interacting with the world and engaging with people shattered the resolve of many Godlost believers. Despite their efforts to resist and ignore the ongoing rending, the reality of the situation became increasingly difficult to deny. Spirits were walking the same earth as the Godlost, and their existence was irrefutable.\n\nIn response to this unsettling reality, people began to revisit various old traditions and rituals from the past. They sought solace and protection against the spirits and the rending that was reshaping their world. Over time, a significant number of individuals started to convert to the ancient religions of Haless, drawn to the spiritual practices that had stood the test of time. The once unshakable faith in the Godlost was now being challenged by the tangible presence of the spirits, leading many to explore alternative belief systems in search of answers and security."

[Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice barely audible against the backdrop of chaos.\n\nA mysterious response emerged from the shadows, catching [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] off guard. "More than most of you could imagine," came the whispered reply. Startled, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the attending rulers swiftly turned their attention to the corner of the balcony, their eyes searching for details in the darkness.\n\nCuriosity mingled with caution as [Root.Monarch.GetName] addressed the shadowy figure. "What do you mean by that?" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] asked, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tone a blend of wariness and willingness to hear more. The intruder's response carried no hint of hostility.\n\n"The Left Hand is a pathway to many abilities, some consider unnatural," the shadowy figure revealed. "Abilities that grant power, and with power, you can change the path and future of your nation." As the words hung in the air, the figure extended a dark hand, waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide whether to accept this enigmatic offer."

Their origins and the source of their incredible power remained shrouded in mystery, prompting countless individuals to pore over ancient scrolls and myths in search of answers. As the Rending of the Realms unfolded, this curiosity found a powerful resonance in the heart of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the ruler of the land, who yearned to unravel the secrets of these enigmatic beings.\n\nThe ruler's thirst for knowledge concerning The Spirits and their unparalleled magical might was not confined to the palace; it swiftly spread throughout the nation and even beyond its borders. People from all walks of life began to contemplate the possibilities and mysteries surrounding these beings.\n\nOne seemingly unremarkable evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and cast long shadows across the land, a scholar made a request that would forever change the course of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s quest for understanding. The message was delivered by soldiers, a simple yet cryptic statement that read, "I can teach you how to become as Great as the Spirits themselves."\n\nThis unexpected and intriguing proposition left [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a choice to make, one that could potentially unlock the secrets of the Great Spirits and their extraordinary power."

Sacrifices were made, fortunes spent, and faith tested to its limits, yet there seemed to be no glimmer of hope on the horizon.\n\nThen, one fateful day, a peculiar phenomenon unfolded in the province. A thick, eerie fog rolled in, shrouding the land in an otherworldly haze. Within this mist, an imposing figure emerged—a giant humanoid form with piercing red eyes that peered down upon the local towns. Fear gripped the hearts of the people, for it seemed that the spirits were finally coming to claim them.\n\nHowever, to their surprise, the colossal figure extended an equally massive hand from the depths of the fog. A voice echoed through the mist, promising change and power, and offering a glimmer of hope where there had been none. Desperation and panic coursed through the people as they weighed their options.

The Rending continued to dominate the night sky, casting its ominous presence over the land. The citizens believed that by putting in extra effort and devotion during the festival, they might somehow appease the Spirits and bring an end to the relentless chaos.\n\nTwice as much incense burned, filling the air with fragrant smoke that mingled with the scent of various plants and leaves specially chosen for the occasion. Elaborate paper artworks adorned the streets and homes, and the festivals themselves took on a more exuberant and wild character. In the heart of each town, towering pyres blazed, their flames reaching toward the heavens, and their smoke enveloping the entire area.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, the festivities reached a crescendo. People danced energetically, their movements infused with both celebration and desperation. It was a spectacle of colors and lights, a fervent display of hope that their collective efforts would somehow halt the unending disaster.\n\nThen, a remarkable and unexpected occurrence unfolded. Giant, dark shadows appeared amidst the revelry, seamlessly joining the dancers in their intricate movements. They mimicked the people and even the Harimari, blending into the festival as if they had always been a part of it. The somber shades transformed into vibrant hues, as the citizens continued with their dances and rituals.\n\nOni, both Red and Blue, took part in the festival as well, fully aware of the dire circumstances that had brought everyone together.

These spirits, often embodying the somber and melancholic aspects of war and death, have made their presence known by singing and playing songs that are traditionally associated with funerals and mourning.\n\nWhile these spirits may not always be malevolent, their relentless presence and constant reminder of death have taken a toll on the morale of our troops. Soldiers, no matter their strength of will, are human beings who bear the heavy burden of risking their lives in the service of their nation. The ceaseless sounds and songs of doom, combined with the harsh realities of warfare, have shaken even the most resilient among them.\n\nMaintaining the morale and mental well-being of our soldiers is of utmost importance, as it directly affects their effectiveness in battle. It is essential to address this issue and find ways to mitigate the impact of these spirits on our troops.

Instead of disaster, the spirits embraced the celebration and participated actively. They possessed individuals, forming various groups and bands that played in harmony with the living musicians. It became a musical battle, a contest of notes and rhythms between our citizens and the spirits themselves.\n\nThis extraordinary night of music and magic continued until sunrise, leaving the last bard standing but exhausted from playing for hours on end. The spirits departed satisfied, and their presence continued to bless our nation for several months. Their music uplifted the spirits of our soldiers, providing them with a sense of encouragement and inspiration as they faced the challenges of the realm.

The world around [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] seems unfamiliar, and [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] feels a strange heaviness in [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] body. As [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] gazes around, [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] eyes fall upon a bloody circle etched into the ground. Recognition dawns upon [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] as [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] realizes that this is the aftermath of a blood ritual, a dark and ancient practice.\n\nQuestions race through [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] mind. Who could have been sacrificed in this ritual, and for what purpose? [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] begins to examine [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] surroundings more closely, taking note of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] noble robes and the scars on [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] arm, both of which seem strangely significant.\n\nWith a sudden realization, [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] expression transforms from confusion to a devious and knowing smile. It becomes clear to [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has been reborn, brought back from some unknown fate by the very ritual [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] now stands amidst. [Root.Heir.GetHerHisCap] comment about the unchanging nature of things suggests that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] might have had some prior knowledge or experience with such matters.\n\nDetermined to unravel the mysteries of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] newly regained mortal life, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] stands up and sets out to explore the world around [Root.Heir.GetHerHim], [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] journey filled with intrigue and uncertainty."

Many in the court view [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] with skepticism and consider [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to be an ineffectual figurehead, someone easily manipulated or discarded when the time is right. This perspective is, of course, quite different from the powerful and knowledgeable entity [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] once was.\n\nHowever, [Root.Heir.GetName] chooses to embrace this newfound persona willingly. [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] pretends to be carefree and prone to making mistakes, cultivating an image of someone who poses no real threat and is content to let others take the reins of leadership. The contrast with [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] previous existence is striking, and [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] finds solace in the simplicity of this life, where [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] can relax and even make mistakes without dire consequences.\n\nDespite [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] seemingly carefree facade, [Root.Heir.GetName] hasn't forgotten the ritual that brought [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] back from the brink of some unknown fate. [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] feels a deep sense of gratitude and respect toward the young heir whose life was sacrificed for his rebirth. In many ways, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] sees it as a second chance at life, an opportunity to experience the world anew.\n\nWith [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] ancient knowledge and formidable magical abilities, [Root.Heir.GetName] knows that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] possesses power that far surpasses those around [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]. However, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] bides [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] time, choosing not to reveal the extent of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] capabilities. Instead, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] observes the close family members and court members who hold significant influence over the nation.\n\nIn this new chapter of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] existence, [Root.Heir.GetName] treads carefully, waiting for the right moment to make [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] move and perhaps reshape the fate of the kingdom. For now, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] continues to play the role of the seemingly unassuming and carefree heir, all the while plotting and planning behind the scenes."

This development is both reassuring and a stark reminder of the conditions of his rebirth.

It's not just a casual encounter; it's as if fate itself has guided [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] toward this individual. The scar on his arm itches and serves as a reminder of a past memory—a memory of humiliation and petty rivalry.\n\n[Root.Heir.GetName] decides to take action. [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] confronts the general, addressing the past events that led to his humiliation. While [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] does so with a measured tone and a certain level of respect, there is an underlying message: [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] won't stand for such treatment, especially not now with his newfound perspective and powers.\n\nIntriguingly, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] proposes a sparring match, a way to settle their differences and perhaps put an end to the lingering tension. [Root.Heir.GetName]'s actions are not only about personal redemption but also a means to assert [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] within the hierarchy of the palace. It's a subtle maneuver that sends a message to those around [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]: [Root.Heir.GetSheHe]'s not just an heir by name; [Root.Heir.GetSheHe]'s a force to be reckoned with."

This quest for answers brings [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to a visit by the local governor and his son to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s palace.\n\nAs [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] observes their arrival, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] can feel his remaining scar tremble. It's as if an invisible thread of fate is pulling [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] toward the governor and his son. [Root.Heir.GetName]'s eyes narrow, and his senses become acutely attuned to any hints or clues.\n\nDuring their visit, the governor and his son engage in small talk and polite conversation, but [Root.Heir.GetName]'s intuition tells [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] that there's more beneath the surface. [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] notices the son's sidelong glances and hears subtle remarks, all of which suggest that they are playing a game of deception. They even go so far as to paint [Root.Heir.GetName] as the instigator, claiming that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe]'s been giving them the "bad eye."\n\n[Root.Heir.GetName], not one to tolerate falsehoods or manipulation, decides to take matters into his own hands. [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] agrees to join them for a tea party, using this opportunity to not only uncover the truth but also send a clear message: [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will not be a pawn in their schemes, and [Root.Heir.GetSheHe]'s more than capable of handling [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] within the court's intricate web of politics and intrigue."

[Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] could strive to improve the lives of the people in his nation, using his knowledge and abilities to enact positive change and reforms.\n\n[Root.Heir.GetName]'s decision will not be an easy one.

While it is fortunate that they are still following orders and not causing harm, the situation is highly unpredictable and could potentially lead to complications or accidents.\n\nAs a first step, we should ensure the safety and well-being of our soldiers. They should be closely monitored during their training to prevent any harm or accidents. Additionally, we must conduct a thorough investigation into the origins and intentions of these possessing spirits.\n\nI would advise consulting with our court wizards and scholars to see if they can shed any light on this phenomenon. It may also be prudent to seek the guidance of spiritual leaders or mediums who have experience in communicating with spirits.\n\nWe must proceed with caution and gather as much information as possible before deciding on the appropriate course of action.

 spirits.708.d:0 "On what began as yet another ordinary day in the Demon Hills, a subtle shift was afoot. The sentries entrusted with watching over this foreboding terrain observed the fog thickening, an unusual occurrence that went largely unnoticed. As the guards stood watch, some half-asleep, a profound event unfolded deep within a long-forgotten crypt nestled at the heart of the temple—a place where Hokuma, the Black Mist of the Demon Hills, stirred from his aeonic slumber.\n\nWithin the crypt, Hokuma manifested as an ominous, inky mist, seething with long-held anger. He rent the crypt asunder, engulfing and extinguishing all life within the vicinity of the complex, showing no mercy to oni or human alike. His form, suffused with an asphyxiating density, left no survivors in its wake. For eons, Hokuma had been harnessed by the oni for his chi and spiritual powers, but that era had drawn to a close. Now, Hokuma is free once more and consumed by an unrelenting desire for vengeance upon his captors. His wrath knows no bounds, sparing none in his wake.\n\nWith the protective wards of the High Temple dissipated, Hokuma could finally exact his revenge upon those who had held him captive. He crushed, dismembered, and tore apart his tormentors bit by bit, employing his shapeless spirit in the same merciless manner that had been used against him. Kindness holds no place in his heart, only an insatiable thirst for retribution against those who had wronged him."

He came to an abrupt halt before [Root.Monarch.GetName]. "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! The dragon has Awoken!" Once again, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] found themselves standing in uncertainty, grappling with how to respond. The knowledge of the Mighty Dragon Yanhe existed solely in legends and myths. Amid the ensuing chaos that filled the palace, urgency gave way to bewilderment. Beyond the palace's windows, Royal guards pointed towards a distant spectacle. Without hesitation, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] approached the windows for a clearer view.\n\nDown the main flowing river Yanhe, spanning miles, a colossal spectral dragon emerged. The legendary Great Spirit let out a deafening roar, his regal head ascending towards the sky, causing the surrounding spectacle to expand with each passing moment. "It's drawing nearer!" The voices of the guards rang out as the massive phenomenon traversed Haless in the blink of an eye. A piercing scream rent the air, flames ascending to the heavens with such magnitude that an entire country could be laid to waste. Beside the windows, those present were violently propelled by the force of the sonic shockwave emanating from the palace. Glass shattered, ribs cracked, guards lay unconscious, and [Root.Monarch.GetName], struggling to maintain consciousness, cast a final gaze upon the mighty spirit.\n\nIn that fleeting moment, [Root.Monarch.GetName] grasped a realization: only those possessing unwavering dedication or an indomitable will could hope to withstand the presence of such an awe-inspiring creature. And so, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mind succumbed to obscurity, the toll exacted by the sound shock rendering [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] unconscious, joining countless citizens across the country in a shared fate."

Panic rippled through the populace as troubling accounts emanated from various regions, detailing the inundation caused by the majestic river Kharunyana. A tremendous tidal wave devoured not only people but also their homes, and, in some heart-wrenching instances, entire villages vanished beneath its relentless currents.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] struggled to fathom the cause. The court was abuzz with theories, from suspicions of a potent mage's hand to finger-pointing at the oni or demonic cults, though the latter seemed an unlikely culprit for such a catastrophe. Examining the reports, the flooding appeared to be natural, originating both upstream and downstream. Yet, it defied reason, given the absence of heavy rain for several days and the guards' accounts of nothing unusual upstream. Moreover, the unnaturally rapid pace at which the flooding spread was perplexing. What should have taken hours or even days to flood from one point to another had occurred simultaneously across miles, as if the river had surged as one.\n\nA local priest suddenly barged in, hastily kneeling before [Root.Monarch.GetName]. His pronouncement startled the court, though many dismissed him as a deluded old man. "This is mere folklore nonsense," one advisor remarked dismissively. However, their skepticism waned when the guards also rushed in, urgently warning of the river's sudden rise in the province.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] and the advisors hurried to the gate to witness the spectacle. Down the path, the river glowed with a faint azure hue, and suddenly, an otherworldly entity burst forth. Alongside it, the river—bestower of life and wealth to the land—swiftly reclaimed everything it had taken, swallowing it back into its depths. Trailing behind [Root.Monarch.GetName], the old priest approached, his voice trembling, "He seeks to reclaim the riches he once bestowed, ever since his imprisonment in the cold and desolate abyss, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].""

What made the situation even more peculiar was that all these birds seemed to bow, an act that could only be described as reverence, directed toward one of the eastern peaks of the Phokhao Range.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was confronted with a multitude of theories, ranging from unusual migration patterns to the outbreak of a mysterious avian ailment. Yet, among these speculations, one theory stood out distinctly. "The Regal Peahen has awoken," declared an elderly man who claimed to reside in the very mountains in question. His words resonated with a conviction that bespoke honesty, far removed from the demeanor of a liar or braggart. "The Queen of all Peafowl, Phokhao, has risen. Look to the skies."

Fortunately, the soldiers who faltered received no immediate reprimand and were allowed to repeat their exercises.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] observed this scene, only for the earth to tremble once more, albeit slightly. This time, only a handful of soldiers misplaced their steps, eventually toppling to the ground, now facing disciplinary action. However, a peculiar pattern struck [Root.Monarch.GetName]. With precise timing, the third quake occurred, and at that very moment, a single snowflake gently landed on their face. Gazing skyward, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was perplexed to witness snowfall despite the absence of any clouds.\n\nAs the fourth quake reverberated, a sudden snowstorm materialized and raced toward the temple, sparking widespread panic. People were engulfed by snow and ice, their confusion mounting in the face of this inexplicable phenomenon. Amidst the fog-draped mountains of Xianjie, the silhouette of Hengdz Bowu emerged—a colossal, frog-like Great Spirit. With each leap, this entity summoned snow and storms, casting the region into turmoil.\n\nNow, it is [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s turn to confront the Great Spirit, seeking a way to restore peace and balance to the land, though the challenge ahead looms as formidable as the storm itself."

It was a much-needed moment of respite for [Root.Monarch.GetName] after the recent calamities that had beset [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court.\n\nHowever, this moment of serenity proved short-lived.

They attempted to speak, but no words emerged, their expressions of awe conveying more than any words could. It was at that moment that the palace was abruptly enveloped in shadow. [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze toward the source, and there it emerged.\n\nCinulau, The Guardian of The Sea, appeared in all its colossal splendor. This massive whale dwarfed even the largest of the islands, leaping from the inky depths of the black sea. It left a trail of sky-blue energy in its wake.

This ritual took place at a modest temple housing a monitor lizard. Offerings were presented to the lizard as a gesture of reverence, seeking the favor and blessings of the Great Spirit. Over time, the monitor lizard had grown closer to both the people in the court and [Root.Monarch.GetName]. It was a quiet and observant presence, rarely causing any trouble, though it occasionally snapped at those it found suspicious, including diplomats.\n\nHowever, on this particular day, the monitor lizard was conspicuously absent. Both the guards and advisors interpreted its absence as a dire omen. Search parties were hastily dispatched, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] ventured out with a group to scour the region and its numerous forests in search of the lizard. A disconcerting development occurred as hundreds of soldiers also went missing during the search. Such a mass disappearance was an extreme rarity and a cause for grave concern.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] group pressed onward, they eventually arrived at a clearing. After ensuring they could retrace their steps back to the path they had taken, they continued forward. However, a strange and eerie silence enveloped them in the heart of the forest. Suddenly, [Root.Monarch.GetName] found [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] alone, separated from the rest of his group. There were no sounds, only an expanse of trees surrounding [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. In that moment, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt an overwhelming sense of doom, fearing that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had been forsaken due to his ineptitude.\n\nNight began to fall, casting the forest into deeper shadows. In the distance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] noticed a faint shimmer at the end of one of the many paths crisscrossing the local woods. All other paths seemed to lead into darkness, and so [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to follow the shimmering path, hoping it would lead [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to safety or at least provide a painless end. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] ran desperately, the darkness swiftly engulfing the path behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stumbled upon a group of guards searching for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], offering [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] salvation.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned away to rejoin the guards, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] spotted the monitor lizard. It emitted a soft, radiant blue glow, the source of the shimmer on his path. The lizard appeared slightly injured, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] sensed that a calamity was impending, one that Lupulan would need all the help it could get to overcome."

Once sober and back within the confines of the palace after the humiliating incident, the court was in an uproar. Reports poured in from across the country, detailing devastation in major cities and a series of raucous parties that had disrupted local peace.\n\nAmidst the reports, a few messages from nobles praised the party. However, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] read the word "party," a vague recollection stirred in Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind. The previous evening, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] distinctly remembered being transformed into an elephant within the palace, though how it had occurred remained a mystery. Even the guards had no recollection. All that remained were the memory of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] glowing eyes and the visible footprints of elephants amid the devastation.\n\nAs the reports continued to flood in, some began to blame [Root.Monarch.GetName] for initiating these festivals and parties, even though [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had neither agreed to nor participated in them.

It appeared to be a colossal spectral lion, a creature of mythical proportions. This was none other than the Roaring Ruler of the Desert, a legend and symbol of nobility and strength. However, it had transcended the realm of folklore and emerged as an unbridled Great Spirit, reclaiming rulership over its domain once more."

The vast expanse of the region, illuminated by the descending sun, captivated [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] senses. However, despite the peaceful surroundings and the presence of various palace animals, including graceful peacocks and exotic birds of paradise, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind refused to find solace.\n\nUnusual unease lingered within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and even the creatures around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] seemed to sense it. A scorpion, perched on the railings, fixated its gaze upon [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Baffled and cautious, [Root.Monarch.GetName] attempted to gently shoo away the scorpion, but it remained unperturbed, its focus unwavering.\n\nGrowing increasingly wary, [Root.Monarch.GetName] summoned the guards to remove the scorpion. However, to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] horror, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] escort suddenly slumped to the ground, lifeless. Panic seized [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] rushed to the balcony in search of escape, only to find it swarming with dozens of brown scorpions. Even from the fallen guards, scorpions emerged, crawling toward [Root.Monarch.GetName].

A voice resonated in the room, declaring, "These lands are not yours to rule," before fading away.

However, on this particular day, something felt amiss.\n\nThe two animals, normally kept in harmony, exhibited unusual behavior. They grew agitated, hissing and launching attacks at each other. The court retainers intervened, attempting to separate and place them on opposite sides of the palace to quell their feud. This allowed [Root.Monarch.GetName] to resume [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] royal duties, sitting upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne.\n\nYet, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] settled into his regal seat, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was startled to find that the same black swan and white turtle had reappeared in the same room. One was positioned on each side, and they continued to glare at each other while emitting hisses. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors were equally surprised by their sudden reappearance.\n\nAmid the confusion, an elderly priest approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] and delivered a foreboding message. He warned of an impending calamity and devastation heading towards their lands. The priest explained that the spirits needed to be appeased or subdued; otherwise, unrest would persist for eternity.\n\nIn the days that followed, the court found itself inundated with piles of messages, requests, and reports. Sightings of spirits, particularly the temple priests across the region, were warning that the Great Spirits had awakened once more. Their message was clear: "Calm the swan and the turtle."

The time had come to quell his raging spirit and put an end to this danger.\n\nWith the High Temples now restored and activated, their energies erupted in a vivid display of blue and yellow, painting the skies with their potent magic. This magnificent display was followed by a cascade of magical rain, which fell upon the Demon Hills. The Great Spirit Hokuma cried out in agony, and the very land quaked and trembled in response.\n\nThe colorful rain of magic washed away the black fog that had once shrouded and defended these lands, sending it back into the depths of the earth.

Shortly thereafter, the river began to radiate a soft, pale blue light, and colossal tendrils of energy shot forth, converging on Yanhe, catching the dragon entirely by surprise.\n\nA thunderous roar reverberated through the realm as Yanhe struggled, flailing amidst torrents of energy, casting forth fiery bursts in futile defiance. Yet, more and more tendrils emerged from the river's depths, spiraling around the formidable eastern dragon until he was entirely shrouded.

They believed it was safer to confine the beast than to try appeasing its otherworldly desires and views. Though a small minority opposed this decision, they were overruled by the majority. The risk to lives was deemed too great, especially with the spiritual world encroaching upon the mortal realm.\n\nReconstruction efforts began swiftly, with the High Temples along the river, the lifeblood of the nation, being rebuilt. Even as the Great Spirit attempted to thwart their efforts, the determined people of the land worked tirelessly. Countless resources were invested over months and years to ensure everything was in place. The moment to activate the Temples and imprison Kharunyana was awaited with bated breath.\n\nThe nobility, the court, and Kharunyana collaborated with haste, carefully planning and safeguarding the reconstruction against spiritual interference.

Pillars of magic rose in the distance, and a wave of blue and yellow energy swept across the lands, enveloping the Spirit. It wriggled and swayed, struggling to break free with all its might. But the ancient arcane magic held firm, entangling it in a net of power.\n\nWith a final effort, the Great Spirit dropped into the river, sinking slowly as if the river had turned to mud, before vanishing into the other side. The river returned to its calm state, and a moment of profound silence filled the courtroom. Then, as the realization set in that the Spirit was finally imprisoned, cheers erupted, filling the air with jubilation and relief."

Pillars of magic appeared on the horizon as High Temples activated across Haless, coating the sky in a yellow and blue hue. Though it challenged Phokhao's radiant beauty, it wasn't enough. Phokhao alone was more radiant than any of these arcane pillars, but it got its attention. That's what [Root.Monarch.GetName] was looking for, followed by the chanting of the mages intensifying as they channeled their powers upon [Root.Monarch.GetName], causing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to burst into a torrent of arcane beauty.\n\nEnveloped in all colors of magic, [Root.Monarch.GetName] attracted Phokhao towards [Root.Monarch.GetName], whose image was now magnified and enlarged into a massive illusion above the city [Root.Monarch.GetName] was standing. The local populace knelt towards and gave prayers to [Root.Monarch.GetName] instead of Phokhao. With that, the Great Spirit finally snapped, as there would be no one else to challenge its beauty and position. Phokhao spread its wings like a fiery bird before leaping down the mountain range, right towards [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The chanting of the mages suddenly changed their tune, and the spiraling torrent of illusionary magic shifted before Phokhao burst through the massive and mocking illusion of [Root.Monarch.GetName], its beak aimed straight for [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s head.\n\nA sudden crash erupted in the middle, sending people, dust, and debris flying everywhere for a few moments. Once the dust settled, [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw the majestic Great Spirit being enveloped by tendrils of yellow and blue colors, tightly grasping the Great Spirit before it started to sink onto the floor.

Looking around, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could see the hired mages channeling all magical reserves onto the tendrils, combining their might with the arcane tendrils channeled from the High Temple Complexes across Haless. [Root.Monarch.GetName] could only see defiance in its raging eyes as it was dragged onto its plane. While everyone else gathered the people and potentially wounded, [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw one last glimpse of sadness, followed by submission, before it was fully gone along with the magical tendrils which sank onto the paved stone floor of the court."

These ancient structures, once in ruins, were meticulously restored to their former grandeur over the course of several months, a task that united the entire nation in purpose. The people worked tirelessly, not only to reconstruct the temples but also to learn the ancient wards and rituals required to activate them.\n\nNow, as the High Temples stood tall once more, the time had come to put their efforts to the test.

The court wizards, like skilled archers, fired a signal into the night sky—a thin but brilliant line of blue magic that cut across the darkness. Just as the whale was about to reenter the sea, the earth trembled. From the distant mainland, a colossal wall of yellow and blue magic surged through the land like a tsunami. It collided with the mighty spirit, enveloping it like a fisherman's net. The great beast fell back into the sea, vanishing without a trace. There were no bubbles, no waves—only the tranquil sea and the moonlight gently washing over the once-troubled land.\n\nThe people of Haless emerged from their homes, their night filled with jubilant cheers.

Even if [Root.Monarch.GetName] wanted to change course, the court and the elite of the lands would oppose [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\nAll [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could offer was some protection, but for the sake of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] country and the people of Haless, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had to restore and activate the High Temples once more. The past few years had been dedicated to achieving this goal: scouring the lands for artifacts, quelling occasional conflicts among the spirits, and rebuilding the Temples. It had been a tedious and weighty task, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] pressed on. Fortunately, the formidable four spirits remained unaware of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] and the court's plans, or at least they didn't understand them fully. Those who did had not gathered enough power to thwart the restoration. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had made sure of that. So much had been invested in the restoration; there was simply no turning back.\n\nAs the final date approached, with the entire court assembled along with several mages, they waited for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to signal the activation of the temples, thus ending the disaster once and for all. "For the peace of this country and its people," [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared before the mages cast a spell into the sky. This prompted the Temples across Haless to hum and erupt in pillars of blue and yellow magic, shrouding the sky before the magic flooded the land with its arcane power. It separated the realms from each other, finally allowing peace to return to the lands once more."
 spirits.732.a:0 "A tentative peace."
 spirits.733.t:0 "The Burning Gaze Subsides"
 spirits.733.d:0 "Tughayasa was a rather peculiar Great Spirit, distinct from all others due to its seeming omniscience, its keen intellect, and worst of all, its omnipresent surveillance of all within its domain. [Root.Monarch.GetName] ultimately decided to imprison it after numerous sleepless nights, for even during slumber, a burning sensation lingered in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] forehead, as if the Great Spirit could peer into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dreams.\n\nThe incessant feeling of being observed and the resulting paranoia had become unbearable for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] country's court and citizens. Some believed the Great Spirit had ceased its surveillance, only for the sensation to return. In certain cases, people couldn't discern whether it was genuinely watching them or if their minds played tricks on them. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] and the court collectively agreed to end this ordeal.\n\nTemples were rebuilt and artifacts were returned. Although it seemed strange, the Great Spirit appeared to comprehend [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] actions and orders. It witnessed the restoration of the temples with minimal resistance. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wondered if the Great Spirit truly understood [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] intentions. Nevertheless, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dismissed such thoughts, focused on the task at hand.\n\nAfter months and years of combating various spirits and disasters, the temples were finally restored. [Root.Monarch.GetName] impatiently awaited the final inspection by the court's wizards and priests before receiving approval to activate the temples. Eagerly, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gave the command to initiate the process, and the guards and wizards promptly complied. The temple powered up, emanating a faith-infused blue and yellow magic.\n\nYet, an odd sensation lingered; even with a paper talisman suddenly adhered to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] robe, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt no response from the Great Spirit. Both [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and the Great Spirit gazed at the temple, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] couldn't tear [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes away from the paper talisman. It was as if the talisman peered directly into its prison, yet it remained passive, merely observing. After a few moments, the temples erupted in magic, unleashing a colorful fountain of blue and yellow into the sky, clashing with the heavens as the magic began to spread throughout the land. The paper talisman on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest gently burned away from the magic, yet it still elicited no reaction; it simply sizzled away without resistance.\n\nAs night fell and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] returned to the court, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] received reports that all talismans and spirits had finally disappeared. They were finally free from its influence!"
 spirits.733.a:0 "My mind aches with regret..."
 spirits.735.t:0 "The Rending Subsides"
 spirits.735.d:0 "Long have we toiled, long have we suffered. The spirits knew little mercy for the natives of Haless, many fledgling states mercilessly crushed beneath the incomprehensible onslaught. We have not come out of this ordeal stronger, we have not learned some essential lesson from this all. All we have learned is that the world is cruel, and that we must treasure every moment that remains. For we know not of when the next Rending shall arrive."
 spirits.735.a:0 "I pray that it is not soon."

 spirits.750.d:0 "The temples have been corrupted to serve our unique needs. The shamans have inscribed rites and runes into the High Temples, now serving as mere chains, ready to heave themselves upon the Great Spirit we now set our eyes upon. An oni warlock's third eye quivers, as if anticipating the bountiful harvest of Chi that awaits it. Now, our mystics and worksmen toil tirelessly to prepare the Grand Receptical, with which we shall seal the ancient terror's spectral form in forever more."

What really happened he can't recall, no matter how hard he tries, and not even mages could help him recover his memory. He does however know that he ventured deep into the temple, through the impenetrable darkness of the temple's heart before it all turned black. And whatever happened there, it loaded his body with chi and opened his inner chi gates. Gaining not only strength but also a wealth of knowledge.

In fact at the very end of the trail we found a group of them, standing in a moderate sized room. All standing on their feet but with their eyes missing their pupils, nothing not even stabbing them caused a reaction, almost like they were unconscious or dead. The militia men moved them as quickly as possible out of the temple, trying to interrogate them later.

Among these enigmatic artworks, one holds the centre stage in an impassioned discourse—what is the nature of this creature? The majority of onlookers and scholars perceive it as a simian entity, yet an assertive faction contends that it is, in fact, a goblin.

During a visit to the High Temple, our esteemed ruler paused, contemplative. What could that semicircle symbolise? Is it an empty vessel, evoking hunger's grip? Does it encapsulate the Moon's sway over tides? Might it form part of a ritual, a vestige of a bygone custom enshrouded in the mists of antiquity? Or does it harbour an altogether distinct significance, a riddle yet unsolved? Its import cannot be denied! Casting a discerning gaze around, they sought the insights of a groundskeeper, an individual deeply attuned to the temple's essence. As the groundskeeper's gaze alights upon the carving, a moment of contemplative silence passes, and then, with a sudden burst of certainty, they exclaim:"

 spirits.418.d:0 "High Temples are typically sanctuaries subject to vigilant oversight by authorities; however, on occasion, unforeseen incidents transpire. A dispute between two merchants within the revered High Temple of [Root.GetName] escalated into a chaotic fight, involving into a clash of at least twenty individuals. Projectiles were hurled, heads bashed, and bodies smashed. While the prompt intervention of local guards ultimately quelled the brawl, tragically, two lives were lost and multiple participants sustained grave injuries. Compounding the distress is the lamentable fact that the temple itself incurred some measure of damage, fortunately not extensive enough to necessitate extensive restorative efforts."

 spirits.419.d:0 "The High Temples are like a puzzle we can't solve. Even though we've been near them for ages, we still don't know why they were built or who specifically built them. We know that it was a precursor realm, but the reasons behind them remain a mystery. This mystery has led to some strange ideas over time, like the thought that ancient aliens made them or that they were built by a kingdom that got submerged. Even though these ideas might sound a bit crazy, they've attracted quite a few people. Unfortunately, another idea has caused trouble. A group, more like a cult, has taken control of the High Temple in [Root.GetName]. The cult claims to know the real purpose of the temples. They say the temples, especially their centre, are actually powerful weapons that can be used to destroy what they call the ultimate source of evil: the moon.It might sound really weird and hard to believe, but we need to act and get the temple back from them before they cause serious damage."

 spirits.420.d:0 "The true purpose of the temples remains a mystery to us. However, this hasn't prevented people from concocting peculiar theories. Whether it's suggestions of a hidden indoor pool that heals all ailments or assertions that it once served as a refuge for an ancient Chickendeity, each theory seems more outlandish than the last. \n\nRecently, a new theory has surfaced, involving a High Temple in [Root.GetName]. A group known as the "Freelovers'' has seized control of the temple, transforming it into an open-air brothel where all are encouraged to indulge in worldly desires, or so they profess. According to their belief, the High Temples were sacred places where the precursors engaged in almost ritualistic acts of love. And while their theory is undoubtedly absurd and probably won’t take hold, many are calling for the expulsion of these "Freelovers" from the temple before their actions tarnish the sanctity of the entire site."

 spirits.421.t:0 "Plundering of the High Temple"
 spirits.421.d:0 "War means devastation and pillaging of holy sites, including the High Temples. And even their profound importance doesn't shield them from being ravaged in times of conflict. The High Temple located in [Root.GetName] fell victim to plundering, resulting in the loss of both ancient relics and more contemporary artefacts. Moreover, the structure itself sustained extensive damage from the ravages of fire. The timeline for reclaiming the province remains uncertain, yet it is evident that substantial repairs are imperative. Our informants embedded within the city report concerning findings: cracked walls, the burning of wooden elements within, and a shroud of soot covering the entire complex. While our aspiration is to regain authority over the structure, we cannot afford complacency until [spirit_temple_plunderer.GetName] takes responsibility and bears the cost of the repairs."

This is as clear as ever, as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has received a letter of demands from our as of recent enemies. They claim that our armies were ransacking the ancient temples that dot the continent of Haless, and that such a foul act can never be taken back... But that it could be forgotten about, with a bit of gold. Should we assist them in rebuilding these ancient monuments, or laugh in their faces?"

 spirits.426.d:0 "After an extended tenure on the throne, during which [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] had heard countless stories and learned of various events transpiring around the High Temple Complexes, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] found [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis]self compelled to visit them. And so, accompanied by a select group of elite escorts, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] embarked on this excursion, led by a high priest who guided [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] through the intricate passageways. The guide meticulously shared their knowledge of the complex and expounded on the numerous theories and practices associated with the temple.\n\nYet, as the guide continued to recount these tales with unwavering diligence, the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s attention began to wane. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] pace gradually slackened, and both [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue of guards inadvertently became entranced by the guiding priest. This distraction led the lord's gaze to fixate on a faint, yellowish hue in the air—resembling wisps of steam—that seemed to beckon [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] forward. Drawn along this ethereal path, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] ventured into one of the many adjacent chambers. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] senses seemed to dull as [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] followed the path of the soft, golden fog, guiding [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] to an empty chamber. Suddenly, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] was seized by a bolt of lightning, or perhaps some other inexplicable force. As [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] scanned [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] surroundings and emerged from this trance-like state, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] found [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] recollection to be hazy, left only with the impression of a small, vacant room imbued with a golden radiance.\n\nSoon thereafter, the guards hastened to [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s side, swiftly ushering [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] away and ensuring [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] well-being. Trained physicians attended to [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] needs in the wake of this enigmatic episode."

[Root.Monarch.GetHerHimCap] fists clench and the doctors quickly remove the needles before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] slowly gets up unhindered by any injury, in fact [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] never felt better before! The doctors are rather stunned how fast the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] moved as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] tended to lag behind in movement. They ask [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to lay down to check once more only to find out that nothing was wrong? While the doctors spoke and checked with each other the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was already out on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne, leading the nation anew into a better direction"

Even our glorious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] needs a breather if not gather some inspiration. And so [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] settled for a hill top underneath a chrysanthe tree with a perfect view of the High Temple on the other side of the province. And with a simple bamboo flute [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] played. Soft tunes playing out [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] whole life up to this point, the harsh yought, the ever threatening coronation as the new ruler. All the decisions, be it good or bad that brought [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to this point under this chrysanthe tree. At that moment only [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could be heard, across the small valley, attracting citizens to check the source of the soothing sounds.

The obvious answer was, one is a spiritual matter and the other a material one. "No! But also yes" was the merchant's reply "Both are in principle the same. Exchange one to gain something else, in this case we exchange our time and dedication into faith to get the blessings of Spirits, gods or even oneselves. Trade does that too, exchanging our time and dedication to gain goods, money and wealth. That does not mean that they have to be separate, no? In the end we merchants do also exchange our wealth and goods to enrich ourselves in faith and piety. But there are exceptions on both sides, no? If you are interested I'd like to discuss some more with you."

I spun around in horror, only to catch a fleeting glimpse of a malevolent grin retreating into the darkness. My heart pounded in my chest, and a primal fear overcame me. I let out a blood-curdling scream and sprinted up the stairs, not daring to look back. My breath was ragged as I raced straight home.\n\nUpon my arrival, panting and terrified, my mother brushed off my claims, dismissing them as childish imagination. My father scoffed, attributing the scratch to a stray animal. However, my grandmother, her eyes hollow and distant, whispered with eerie certainty, "They are coming, and our time is running out."

One day, upon returning home, I found my wife in shock and grief. My worst nightmare seemed to be unfolding, yet nothing had prepared me for this. My father hadn't passed away; no, he had disappeared.\n\nIn a blind panic, I rushed out of the house and asked neighbors and others if they had seen my father. Everyone gave the same rehearsed answer: "heading towards the High Temple." Confused and with a sinking feeling that something was gravely amiss, I sprinted to the High Temple. And there, I found him. He was kneeling in the middle of a courtyard. As I entered this ancient place of doom, he turned to me with a grin—a grin so wide and unsettling that no human should wear it. I stared at him for what felt like hours; an unknown force rendered me speechless until I managed to croak out, "Dad?" In response, "he" stretched his grin even further, his eyes turning black, and a transparent aura enveloped him.\n\n"Realms fall, rulers perish, and Haless will rend like cloth in the wind," he exclaimed, his voice a cacophony of pent-up anger, vengeful desire, and lustful sadism, as if thousands were speaking as one. After this, he briefly regained his composure and collapsed to the ground, like a puppet discarded by its puppeteer. I caught him, and as I attempted to carry him out of the High Temple, I felt as if thousands of eyes and voices were watching and whispering to me—indistinct but clear in their message: something is awry, and this is just the beginning."

 spirits.703.t:0 "The Rending of the Realms"
 spirits.703.d:0 "For millennia, the High Temples stood as enigmas, constructed in a bygone era by a realm long faded from memory, their true purpose shrouded in mystery. Over the ages, philosophers wrestled with the meanings behind the intricate inscriptions, sages sought to untangle the prophecies they held, and the cursed dared to harness their power for their own ends. And, with every endeavor, they cast yet another "pebble" onto the Temples, each one adding to the countless others, slowly cracking its shell, for a single pebble accomplishes nothing, two achieve little, but thousands of pebbles make a difference.\n\nA scratch evolved into a crack, and a crack into a wound. While a lone wound may evoke little concern, enduring thousands of wounds is insurmountable—much like the fate of the High Temples. Already weakened, these Temples crumbled swiftly, eroded by time's inexorable passage, both in a tangible and abstract sense. Even the most robust walls of the pristine temples succumbed to the torrent of thousands of spirits, suddenly reinvigorated after eons of imprisonment.\n\nThe High Temples shattered. A deluge of spirits—countless in number—flooded streets as if a supernatural tide, rending lands and engulfing nations. From towering peaks to shadowed valleys, the landscape teems with spectral entities. A veritable invasion, as spirits both minute and great converged, driven by a singular purpose: evading the confines of the High Temples and being free once more.\n\nAnd so Haless descends into chaos and fear. Spirits inhabit every nook and cranny, some benign, though most seem to hold an inexorable aggression towards those that dared to suppress them for so many eons. While the spirits reap what we seem to have sowed, our people react in a multitude of ways; spawning doomsday cults prophesying the end, or rallying against the state's paralysis due to the Rending and demanding action. Yet, the majority quiver within their homes—a deceptive sanctuary, as the Rending affects everyone and reaches everywhere."

 spirits.737.d:0 "This proves to be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most challenging task yet for the nation. Restoring the High Temples across Haless was one feat, but the Demon Hills lacked a High Temple, and the warding elements in the restored Temples were scarcely understood due to their age. Countless individuals and mages were dispatched to find a method to redirect and ensure the Demon Hills felt the impact of the High Temple's magic. Many lives were sacrificed in vain, but it was a necessary endeavor to halt the impending disaster. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] maintained a cold focus, contemplating the toll these efforts took on lives. Eventually, the nation would recover from this, thanks to the sacrifices made; the future would be better and stronger.\n\nAfter years of reconfiguring the High Temples, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] breathed a sigh of relief. With a small escort, they waited at the borders of the Demon Hills, just beyond Hokuma's reach but close enough for Hokuma to sense them. With a decisive gesture, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] signaled the court wizards escorting them to activate the Temples in the distance, painting the skies with explosive magic. They waited for the heavens to be adorned with ancient blue and yellow arcane colors, dispelling the spirits plaguing the realm before they inundated the demonic Hills. Sensing impending doom, Hokuma resisted as the black fog flooded from the ground and the Demon Hills, clashing against the warding magic of the High Temples. Like two rivers colliding, the black fog began to recede, revealing that even a Great Spirit has limits.\n\nWith arcane magic pushing back Hokuma's might, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and the escort advanced into the Hills, deeper into the lands and an ancient forgotten temple. They walked toward the heart of the lands, Hokuma's prison. Only a door stood between [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and the arcane magic from the High Temples, adorned with countless magic runes and spells. Hokuma, no longer fighting, hid in the only place left, hoping that the little freedom remaining wouldn't be taken away. However, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had no mercy left after dedicating so much time and resources to this cause. With another order to the court wizards, they blasted the door away with all their magical might, flinging it into a room filled with black goo. Though the fog was thick, the blue and yellow magic wrestled with Hokuma's fog, tearing it out and swallowing it back through the door.\n\nThis further enraged Hokuma for a moment, but he had no power left. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] looked with a smile at what remained of Hokuma's might. The arcane magic slowly dissipated, its colors turning darker until they were fully sanguine, whirling past [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis]'s body, the only thing Hokuma could see—a black silhouette with a spiral of red arcane magic pooling behind them. "You caused so much damage, but don't worry; with your powers, we can undo that. I can repair the damage you caused." With that, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] emerged from the Temple with their guard, eyes glowing faintly red. They spread their arms, dispersing the fog towards them, now surrounded in a shroud of black and red fog, freeing the Demon Hills from Hokuma's influence once and for all... by placing it under someone else's."

But that lasts only for a few moments before Yanhe shows itself across the lands, casting a shadow of might as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] patrols the River and lands like a King of Kings.\n\nBut it won't last much longer. While [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] basks in the glory of the sun, replacing its spot for the people of the lands, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people work in Yanhe's shadows. While Yanhe indulges itself in the offerings of people and spirits, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people work in the High Temples. While Yanhe rests, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the court spend the nights and countless lives restoring the arcane magic in the Temples. After years, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] can finally walk through the halls and chambers of Tianlou and its High Temple. Well, for a few more moments before Yanhe would approach [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the High Temple. Like a monolith towering over [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s tiny silhouette, gesturing for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] to kneel before the ruler of the lands. Alas, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] could only smile, if not laugh, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] casually stretches out [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] right hand.\n\nYanhe roars in annoyance that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] defies his orders. And right before Yanhe could retaliate against [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Temple Complex lights up with gorgeous golden hues before it bursts with arcane magic, pushing the Great Spirit off the Temple Complex. Yanhe takes a moment to process what happens before leaning back, looking toward [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] and the Temple Complex, pouring out a roar and divine-looking flames only to be blocked off by the Temples' arcane energies, which are soon followed by several pillars in the distance as other High Temples activate on the horizon.\n\nOnly causing further confusion to the Great Spirit before several yellow and blue tendrils thrust out from the very river named after the Draconic spirit. Trying to wrap and entangle it. A spectacle to hold as the arcane tendrils and Yanhe wrestle, entangling the spirit more and more with each passing moment till it could not hold itself above the ground, causing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] to crash onto the ground with a huge earthquake before the tendrils drag [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body into the River, only for the river to gradually be dyed red. The once-yellow-and-blue tendrils, now bursting out of the river, stream right onto the Temple.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] makes [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] known to the people. Addressing them from the top of the High Temple as the glorious golden rays of the sunshine turn red by the Temples. Basked in the blood-red light was [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis], causing the birds to take flight. "The disaster has finally finished! I Swear that I'm gonna turn our land into paradise, day by day. Undoing the damage that the spirits left behind and lead us into a brighter future!" as now with the powers of Yanhe, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can change fate as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] desires."

We have suffered beneath the lawless tyranny of the Great Spirits, but now, that shall finally end. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands above the Kharunyana with a handful of hand-picked court mages and guards, waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] signal. Waiting for hours until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finally spots a disturbance in the waters.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand, and the court mages fire a magic missile into the sky. Right as the spectral catfish leaps out of the river to show off its might and ferocity, the Temples on either side of the river begin to glow a dark, bloody red. Coating the sky and heavens in bright blue and yellow magic before it fell down onto the great spirit, catching it mid-jump. The guards cheer while [Root.Monarch.GetSheName] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] other hand. One more magic missile fires into the air, this time a brilliant earthen glow, and the ground trembles as the arcane magic radiating out from the temples change direction, suddenly sucking in the magic that they released.\n\nMeanwhile, Kharunyana squirms and thrashes inside the magic net in pure panic. Trying to resist and break free, causing gusts of winds flying all over the place, noises started to come out that could not be described besides pure pain, and after a few more moments, the yellow and blue-colored magic net started to shift, turning a deep crimson hue. Kharunyana starts to slow down, swaying and wiggling weaker and slower with each passing second before the magic net starts to lower the Great Spirit into the river. The crimson hue now tainting the river, spreading up and down the stream.\n\n"Everything went as planned," said one of the court mages. [Root.Monarch.GetName] cups [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands, dips them into the now-red river, and takes a deep sip of the liquid. With a satisfied smile, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] opens [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] glowing red eyes."

Locals were also invited to join the festivities. The festival would commence with a spectacular firework show, primarily to capture Phokhao's attention.\n\nA vast court-like area was constructed with a podium as tall as three people at its center where [Root.Monarch.GetName] would stand. Countless mages were stationed along the walls, chanting and channeling their magic. Once everything was set, another firework blast ignited alongside a massive illusion of [Root.Monarch.GetName] in the sky—tall enough to attract the attention of the Great Spirit. On the ground, a royal speaker addressed the festival-goers, emphasizing the glory and prestige of the ruler of Haless and Phokhao. The speaker declared that the being crowned that day would rule all of Haless, as mandated by the heavens.\n\nWith the speaker finished, [Root.Monarch.GetName] knelt behind them, and the display continued with the massive illusion. Phokhao, tempted into action by the blatant disrespect, leaped from the mountain towards the festival. The spectral peahen’s arrival was a majestic calamity, shaking the earth with each delicate step. The mages were pressed against the walls by the sheer pressure of her wings. [Root.Monarch.GetName], despite it all, remained kneeling, while the speaker held the crown towards Phokhao. The speaker declared, "Now I shall crown the righteous ruler of Haless and Phokhao!" as he presented the crown to the Great Spirit.\n\nPhokhao, the most majestic being in Haless, accepted the crown, even if it was tiny compared to her size. She lowered her head to allow the speaker to bestow upon her this treasure, her beak nearly touching the ground. However, at the last moment, she sensed the true purpose of the mages—the ritual was more than a simple illusion. There was no time for the Great Spirit to react. A sudden splash of scarlet covered the court as two yellow and blue spikes of arcane magic pierced Phokhao's head and torso, splitting into tendrils that enveloped the Great Spirit.\n\nThe speaker turned around, with shaking hands, placed the crown on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s head, who finally rose to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet. From the podium, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked down upon the grievously wounded peahen while the mages continued chanting. A red mist started to flow towards her as the High Temples of Haless emitted pillars of ancient magic into the sky and ground, fueling the mages in the court. [Root.Monarch.GetName] spread [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arms in a gesture, showcasing to all of Haless that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was the rightful ruler, with the massive illusion above the city now turned into a red image instead of the colorful robes."

Snowflakes drifted gently from the sky, a harbinger of the Spirit's imminent arrival. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] whispered beneath [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] breath, "They are coming."\n\nSeveral court mages stood nearby, ready to activate the High Temple when the time was right. The earth trembled, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] counted in preparation. "One, two, three…" With a lifted hand, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] signaled the mages, and right on cue, Hengdu Bowu descended from the heavens, causing a tremendous storm to erupt where he landed. Simultaneously, a magical storm of yellow and blue energies surged from the activated High Temple, creating a spectacular clash of elemental forces.\n\nThe Great Spirit leaped into the sky once more, with [Root.Monarch.GetName] listening to the wind, instinctively pointing to the next High Temple to activate. The court mages, following their ruler's lead, launched another magical missile into the air. A pillar of energy appeared on the horizon, met by a burst of blue sparks as Hengdu Bowu descended nearby. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] counted again, "One, two, three…"\n\nThe process repeated as the Great Spirit was led to another High Temple, this time the earth temple, causing a seismic event that sent people to the ground. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] could sense it—the wards of the High Temple had intercepted Hengdu Bowu. Without hesitation, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] pointed to the sky with both hands, and every mage released a missile into the air, creating a dazzling display of lights that illuminated the heavens. The rest of the High Temples activated one by one, while Hengdu Bowu was still recovering, but this time it won't be a simple net of arcane energies capturing the Great Spirit. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had a better idea in mind for the frog spirit. The Arcane energies did not wrap around the Great Spirits, no, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand once more, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze firm upon the horizon. And the court mages only nod before shooting a final magic missile into the air. A scarlet red blast bursts in the sky before the earth shakes and the arcane pillars of the towers intensify as in the distance the Great Spirit is getting surrounded by several sharp tendrils of arcane energies, all pointing at the entangled and struggling Great Spirit, who in this state could hear and see the rest blast in the sky before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] visions turned fully red. The frog's eyes grow weary before drifting into a hopefully eternal slumber.\n\nAnd so a single blood-red snowflake landed in front of [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] who gazed back with a pair of deep scarlet eyes. Peace and power finally returned to the land and its people."

Along all vessels heading out, one was filled with civilians—a transport ship scheduled to travel and bring people from one Ringlet Island to another. Vessels such as these are usually shielded by mages against poor weather and opportunistic pirates. With a strong abjuration in place, the ship sailed out through the stormy sea, bouncing and crashing straight through the waves, each one bigger than the previous.\n\nThe vessel continued bravely, but sooner or later, the waves were too big, too strong for it to continue, and it simply was pushed aside. The ship was now helpless; the faint flickers of its magical ward disappearing as thunder strikes once more. The vessel floated with no direction across the sea, panic spreading like wildfire, screams drowned in the storm with no hope in sight. That was when all sound was swallowed as the darkened form of Cinulau leapt from the sea before its colossal body splashed, a massive wave erupting from the Great Spirit's position as it swallowed all others.\n\nThe civilian ship came unscathed, guided by the massive wave towards Cinulau, letting the Great Spirit get a better look at the vessel and the people on it, like a silent guardian, simply observing in the silent moment, before a crack of thunder interrupted the silence. A single small galley was spotted on the edge; on the bow of the little ship was the mage supposed to protect the civilian ship, commanding the small vessels to attack the Great Spirit with its cannons and, of course, arcane magic.\n\nThe spirit whale simply submerged and leapt once more out of the sea, causing a second massive wave to push both ships, the civilians away from the battles before Cinulau falls upon the warships and swallows them whole. The civilians looked nervously back, then erupted in a cheer, but even that quickly drowned as a painful bellowing erupts from the Great Spirit. It had swallowed the bait. A few people were a small sacrifice for the power that such a Great Spirit would offer, and with another horrible echo, the remainder of the fleet emerges from the horizon.\n\nThe poor spirit tries to resist, shakes and wiggles its massive body, like a small island hovering above the sea, causing waves to erupt underneath it, pushing and even turning a few boats upside down, but there were simply too many people, too many harpoons. By dawn, the beast finally gives up, spending a whole day and night fighting off before it's turned into a pincushion. Turning the sea blood red like the dawn that is rising on the east.

But his power alone was not enough to be a protector of these lands and its people. No, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court could only end this disaster once and for all. They spent countless resources, charting out the lands, finding and securing these ancient High Temples. Years passed by as material and people were spent to rebuild these temples back to the height of their power and function, a sacrifice that had to be made for the future of these lands.\n\nAfter several years, the court receives a message that all the towers are now restored and working.

The Magical firework only continues and even intensifies, casting all kinds of colors and shapes into the sky, plenty ones in the shape of an elephant, the image of Dhenbasana as the Great Spirit continues to indulge itself quietly in the background of the party, tasting wine after wine of the lands greatest wines that even Great Spirits like Dhenbasana could not resist their influence, especially the dwarven brews, causing the Great Spirit to loosen up.\n\nOnce that has been spotted, the court mages continue, giving a different signal, causing the earth to tremble a bit. The High Temple complex continues to awaken, radiating a gentle magical glow which slowly spirals out into an arcane pillar that stretches far into the sky. Dhenbasana continues to drink, more and more intensely, its body swaying with each step, weakened by both the alcohol and the magic of the high temple.\n\nEvery passing moment, the Great Spirit grows weaker and in the depths of the night, the Great Spirit gives in, crashing onto a river of alcohol at the edge of the town. After a few moments [Root.Monarch.GetName] comes around to see the Great Spirit finally with their own eyes. The wine being mixed up with some blue and yellow hues among the deep red. With The Great Spirit finally defeated [Root.Monarch.GetName] lets out a sigh before getting closer, using an empty cup to grab some of the wine that the Great Spirit is laying with closed eyes enjoying every drop of it. [Root.Monarch.GetName] looks upon the horizon as the dawn of a new day comes with their crimson gaze."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] is but a single soul but the ruler of the mortal realm and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] shall show [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is greater than Marutha. And so [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spirit went on to repair the High Temples, sacrificing countless days and souls to achieve that. No price too high compared to the reward [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is gonna get by defeating Marutha!\n\nOnce the preparations are done, [Root.Monarch.GetName] chooses the next morning to finally end Marutha´s reign of terror. With a loud explosion upon the Palace sky, [Root.Monarch.GetName] challenges the Desert Raja, which Marutha with all the freedom [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has now eagerly accepts. Like a tiger on a hunt, he rushes forth, leaving behind a storm and trail of destruction. [Root.Monarch.GetName] orders [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court mages to prepare one more blast upon the sky, a blast full of vivid colors to signal the High Temples in the horizons to activate, and so they do with an earthshaking activation as pillars of blue and yellow pierce the sky.\n\nBut that did not intimidate Marutha; it enraged him only further as he spirits as fast as possible towards the palace, followed by tendrils of arcane magic coming from the High Temples. Marutha dodges and dances past the tendrils while [Root.Monarch.GetName] watches on top of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] balcony, covering [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wrist as sand is blowing from all sides from the massive amounts of magic clashing just in front of the palace. "This is it!" [Root.Monarch.GetName] mumbles as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] bets all upon this, all the power and might and riches that the arcane magic of the temples gonna take down the Great Spirit.\n\nEven the loyal guards are trembling as Marutha comes closer and closer; the guards by the end flee the balcony. [Root.Monarch.GetName] watches as Marutha lunges towards [Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes not fazing as a spectral claw was a mere few inches away from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face before the claw and Marutha are sent flying to the side; one tendril of blue and yellow magic pierces the Great Spirit's body. Marutha does not give up as with ferocious eyes locks on [Root.Monarch.GetName], who yet again does not acknowledge or budge to the Spirit's intimidating glare.\n\nDespite it being impaled, it uses the rest of its energy to lunge once more, but this time a salvo of arcane tendrils erupt from behind [Root.Monarch.GetName] before all thrust into the body of the Great Spirit. Causing it to finally slump down, the arcane magic now tainted and soaked with a crimson hue before they gently turn and sip into [Root.Monarch.GetName], who with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] now crimson glowing eyes, stares down upon the defeated Great Spirit, which only shivers in pain as its energies are being drained.

It's a long-lasting fight, all kinds of tricks, resources, and rituals are brought to keep [Root.Monarch.GetName] awake, not to fall asleep and prey to the Great Spirit. Gallons of caffeine were consumed by the court.\n\nBut just before the final pieces were put in place for the completion of the High Temples, [Root.Monarch.GetName] closed down after over hundreds of days of vigilant resistance to sleep and the Great Spirit. Even the guards could do nothing against [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s body; it was too tired after months of staying awake.

But one thing was for sure, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] would not go down without a fight.\n\nThis resolve was cut short when seconds later, a stinger plunged into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest, plunging [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] onto the throne with a tired drop. Now awake, the courtroom is lively, no walls ruptured, the roof still there, guards around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] all worried along with several court members. [Root.Monarch.GetName] thought that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] was finished.

Two quarrelling sisters were simply too much to bear.\n\nOnce the High Temples were restored and repurposed, the main part of the plan sprung into action. Now the mortals went on the offensive. Hukai and Telebei were not without their tricks, however, and hid among the black swans and white turtles of the region. But with the support of the court, funds were prepared, and a nationwide hunt was declared to track down every swan and turtle across Haless. Both the military and court mages were employed, dragging these animals to the nearest High Temple.\n\nThe hunt was not without accidents, people got attacked not just by the animals; spirits seemed on alert and unusually aggressive. Whole groups of search parties went missing in some cases, but with the help of plenty of court mages, using their arcane knowledge and powers, they were able to complete the search after a few more painful months. Once the last one was caught, a signal was fired into the sky, lighting up the horizon, notifying the palace and [Root.Monarch.GetName] about the capture of all animals. All being put in cages infused with black damestear, guarded by several experienced mages, while the few remaining court mages started to activate the High Temples.\n\nAnother signal is fired, this time from the royal palace and no second is wasted as the ancient temples start to rumble and rise from their timeless slumber. One after another, the sky gets pierced by pillars of arcane blue and yellow arcane energies. All the captured swans and turtles went into a frenzy as the room where they are caged in was being flooded with the ancient magic. They bash and slam their bodies against the metal and crystal cages but they don't budge even magic could not help thanks to the damestear, but that did not stop them, they kept running and lunging, blooding and mutilating their bodies but the guards did not budge. The Temples continue to radiate and activate.

Carefully leading the reconstruction efforts, using the spirits to distract or blame each other so the efforts progress with no issues or attract unwanted attention.\n\nOnce the restorations are finally done, each one of the Four Lords will be hosting a festival in one of the High Temples. Each is decorated in a specific way since each Great Spirit has a different form. A fiery shrine made to the Azure Dragon, elevating him to the same level as Yanhe with art and tributes that show power and authority. The Vermillion Bird, a shrine to elevate its grace and ambitions the same as Phokhao, precious gems and riches paint their shrine. The White tiger shall be elevated on the same level like Marutha with tributes of Might and wisdom inside his shrine. And the Black Tortoise shall mirror Telebei, filled with masterful art and craftsmanship. Artists, priests, and craftsmen from across the region called to ensure the proper dedication towards the spirits.\n\nA nation-wise celebration is called once all temples are prepared. All Great Spirits are called upon. Court mages and priests all do their respective rituals to summon each Great Spirit towards their respective temple, fireworks and illusion magic covering the sky.

And while issues or disturbances have occurred before, this is something different...Read this report from a local girl for example: \n\n"Filthy Hobgoblin, not again!" My friends gave me a wary look as the ball ominously descended the dark and claustrophobic spiral staircase. This was not our first time losing the ball inside the temple, but each time was a nerve-wracking ordeal with the chilling darkness below. Despite the trepidation, we ventured into the foreboding High Temple to reclaim our lost ball. Deep within the dimly lit hall, we finally spotted the ball and hastily turned to leave. But this time, something felt terribly amiss. An unsettling feeling crept up my spine, but before I could ponder it further, I rushed to catch up with my friends, climbing the stairs frantically.\n\nJust as I was about to escape the last of the shadows, a sharp pain shot through my ankle. I spun around in horror, only to catch a fleeting glimpse of a malevolent grin retreating into the darkness. My heart pounded in my chest, and a primal fear overcame me. I let out a blood-curdling scream and sprinted up the stairs, not daring to look back. My breath was ragged as I raced straight home.\n\nWhen I arrived, panting and terrified, my mother brushed off my claims, dismissing them as childish imagination. My father scoffed, attributing the scratch to a stray animal. But my grandmother, her eyes hollow and distant, whispered with an eerie certainty, "They are coming, and our time is running out."

After centuries of captivity, the time for revenge has come, a moment to forever rid the sickly infection of the Left Hand Path and the Onis. Only then can Hokuma finally find solace.\n\nHokuma's appearance is that of a black mist, so deep and dark that no mage or artist has been able to replicate it. Within this mist lies Hokuma's strength, and above all, his rage—rage towards the Onis who have exploited him for ages, milking him for magic and power. But not only is he a spirit of anger, he is a spirit of the earth as well and cares deeply for its wellbeing.\n\nIn truth, Hokuma desires only one thing: tranquillity and peace in his hilly domain.

His feathers are not only the largest, but also the most colourful, adorned with gemstones more splendid than those of the wealthiest merchants and the mightiest kings. Residing in the Phokhao mountain range, far above both human and beast, Phokhao embodies splendour and grandeur, vanity and artistry, while simultaneously embodying generosity, nobility, and benevolence. These traits are not contradictory for Phokhao; instead, they enhance one another. Phokhao's demands and desires are unique, expensive, but above all, noble - something to take pride in.

At this point, a long nose is said to be a sign of his favor, taken to mean one has inherited their patriarch’s guile, from one of his many trunk-in-hand trysts with the lovely men and ladies of his domain. Though the truth or feasibility of this is debatable, brilliant advisors appear and vanish on a whim in the courts of Rahen, leaving trails of innovation and scandal in equal measure in their wake.

Emerging like a grand yet agile and athletic elephant, Dhenbasana is a charmer of prime allure.

When Dhenbasana graces the court with his presence, a magnificent celebration and spectacle inevitably unfolds, sparing no expenses or efforts. Dhenbasana embodies intellect over strength, hedonism over piety, and even intrigues over sincerity and corruption over honour, because according to Dhenbasana, a sealed, candid, and uncomplicated life is simply tedious, boring and monotonous.\n\nDhenbasana's true desire from us is rather simple: a state that personifies hedonism. Away with the rigid and pious followers of High Philosophy, it's time for Rahen to bask in a golden era of pleasure! By gathering the greatest intellects, the most agile acrobats, the finest dwarf brewers, and the most sought-after courtesans, we can transform our court into a hub of delight, debauchery and Dhenbasanic pleasure!"

As while Gehet has a potent poison, their pincers aren’t smaller or less sharp because of this.

Gehet Ketine embodies the essence of espionage, intrigue, and covert operations, its affinity for obscurity allowing it to embody the role of an assassin. With unparalleled finesse, Gehet operates from the concealment of darkness, its marks falling before they even notice, a testament to its mastery in the art of stealth.\n\nThe desert scorpion yearns for the arid expanse to reclaim its status as a haven for nomads and enigmatic assassins. No longer shall it tolerate the dominance of deceitful creeds or those who seek to malign and subjugate the spirits that dwell within. It is our sacred duty to fulfil this mission for Gehet Ketine. From the darkness of the shadows, we shall strike, swift as the desert tempests, and unrelenting as the scorpion's sting."

 spirits.840.d:0 "United like twin rivers, yet separated by the land between them, the river siblings Hukai and Telebei form a symbiosis within Bomdan, bridging the north and south, the rivers that bear their names, and the cities that grace their shores. In their respective territories, these two spirits are viewed as auspicious omens. When a swan herder welcomes new cygnets, it is tradition to invoke the name of the darker Hukai as a tribute to the river. And when a turtle traverses a path along the Telebei, it is deemed an obligation for people to either allow the creature safe passage or aid it in crossing, safeguarding it from harm.\n\nThough dissimilar in appearance, the twin sisters are bound by an unbreakable connection. One is a magnificent black Halless swan, while the other is a steadfast freshwater turtle. This bond symbolises the deep unity among the peoples of these two rivers—forever intertwined in art, craftsmanship, and culture, much like the inseparable twins themselves.\n\nHukai and Telebei yearn for a resurgence of the arts and crafts within their domains. A time where craftsmanship and the arts reclaim their honourable positions, surpassing fleeting trends from distant lands. It rests upon us to reunite the swan and the turtle once more, nurturing the flourishing of the arts. While the glory of war may be transient, the essence of art endures eternally."

 spirits.841.t:0 "Huszien, The Vulpine Lady of Yìnquan"
 spirits.841.d:0 "Long ago, the Vulpine Lady of Yinquan, the queen of spirits, met her demise, not through murder, but through being fragmented into hundreds of fox spirits, a result of the machinations of the Precursors. As she passed, her devoted followers made a singular promise: that she would one day be reborn and subsequently return to her rightful place, and that day has arrived.Upon her resurrection, the Vulpine Lady will take the form of a fox with nine hundred and ninety-nine tails, symbolising the ambiguity between good and evil, the vast realm of moral greyness, and the allure of magic and the arcane. Just as her tails number a thousand, so do choices and interpretations of which none are true good or evil\n\nIf we want to succeed in resurrecting the Vulpine Lady, it will be paramount to ready ourselves for a new era, one where Huszien reigns over both spirits and humans. And so it falls upon us to make the necessary preparations for the resurrection ritual. Let the grand fox spirit rise from the realm of the departed and onto her rightful throne!"

 spirits.842.t:0 "Tughayasa: "All-Seeing Eyes of the Oracle"
 spirits.842.d:0 "The all-seeing eye of Tughayasa stands as a unique spirit, distinct from all others. While some possess vast powers that rend the earth or ensnare the acts of debauchery, Tughayasa simply observes, seeing it all. This great Oracle spirit peers into the future and the past, casting its gaze upon lands both near and far. It perceives the seen and the unseen, culminating as the very essence that bestows its name and symbol upon the Oracle of Tughayasa.\n\nThis sublime Oracle spirit assumes the form of eyes, floating like paper talismans. When blinking it sounds like the shredding of paper and hovers above the world, ever-watchful and contemplative. It epitomises foresight, divination, and the profound philosophical insights and wisdom of the Oracle Order.\n\nTo garner its favour, we embark upon the sacred task of looking into the future, refining the Oracle of Tughayasa to greater heights and stature, and demonstrating to the spirit of unparalleled clarity our worthiness of its gift—the unbroken vision over all the entire expanse of Halann in past, present and future. Let us reveal our merit, inviting all to be seen through the discerning eyes of Tughayasa!"

 spirits.1000.d:0 "Ever since the awakening of the mighty Yanhe, the court of [Root.GetName] has been one of chaos. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] continued to stress over the many issues that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rise has caused, both across the land and within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind as well. [Root.GetName] had long claimed its legitimacy as the Mantle of the Yanhe; the mighty Dragon Army marched across the Yan river under the banner of its fearsome might, striking panic into their enemies. However, this has been brought into question by some of those opposed to us, with the onset of the Rending and the end of his slumber. How can we claim the mantle of Yanhe when Yanhe rampages in our land, bringing devastation in his wake? What legitimacy do we have to this title when its namesake is busy causing untold damage to our realm? What was once whispers had now become the dominant argument amongst the court of [Root.GetName], any semblance of decorum and peace long since gone.\n\nOne such argument had been ongoing for hours, [Root.Monarch.GetName] long since exasperated at the goings-on between [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue, as the foundations seemingly shake, violent tremors rock the fortified basement room deep within the heart of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s Castle. The roof—no, the building itself—tears off its foundations, flung off to some far corner of the city, as the colossal form of Yanhe looks down upon the members of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s court. His body is that of violent storms, huge in his stature. His massive body filled the sky of Bianfang with lightning, thunderous sound to match his thunderous rage. His being exuded raw, violent power.\n\n"To the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetName], you claim the mantle of my domain. My name as your title, as you spread your influence along the length of my river. I find your claim to this mantle bold, yet I cannot help but be impressed with your recent achievements, if only somewhat. So I come to your court with an offer; pledge yourself to me and my service, tear down these abhorrent chains to my being, and you shall be rewarded in kind," orates the Great Spirit, voice booming down from the great Dragon’s maw. The response from the members of the court was immediate, a violent outcry from the more zealous faithful of High Philosophy's teachings, demanding an immediate and violent response. [Root.Monarch.GetName] ignored them, only speaking up to ask the spirit above [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], "And what if I decline?", voice more fearful than confident. "Then I will take my due," the only response. The outcry from the other members of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s retinue increased at this, voices congealing into a loud mass of debate and argument, although none reached [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ears. All but deafened to the reality around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was lost within the confines of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own mind. All that had been fought for, all that they held, could be lost and then some in this very moment. To abandon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] teachings, all [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had known for years would be the height of blasphemy, and the response would be far from measured and calm. But the alternative, the wrath of Yanhe himself, weighs heavy on the shoulders of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. At last, silencing the court, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] responds..."

 spirits.1002.desc:0 "It began like a whisper, a mere change in the winds, but the signs were unmistakable - something disastrous was afoot. At first the river seemed only to slow, but then the languid current stilled entirely - and the unthinkable began. The mighty Kharunyana reversed. Its rushing currents flowed up, up, up the Godswall, into the peaks and the heavens beyond. The whisper grew in intensity to a roar, the unmistakable sound of raging water, as the ground began to shake. Unrestrained animals fled uphill, paintings fell from walls, and urns shattered in homes as an ominous, deep cracking could be heard from the greatest likeness of the High Gods anywhere in Haless, as if the mountains themselves were breaking.\n\nThen all was calm; the shaking stopped and the loud roaring of churning water quieted. The river had become completely still, as if frozen in time, without flow. And then, The Godswall erupted, its ten-thousand year visage shattering out into the air above the Shamakhad plain, water and stone crashing to the ground below in a cacophony of destruction. The thousand carved deities of the Godswall were swept away before the flood, and locals in Maruvad looked on in horror as a leviathan crested the waterfall descending on them from above - a vast blue catfish, glowing an ethereal light, rode along the top of the flood pouring out of the Godsbreach, propelling the torrent of devastation before them. The great spirit Kharunyana had returned to Rahen, and all would know he was here."

 #Temple Quest Encounter descriptions TODO: Can rewrite or just fluff them up - up to a paragraph or two at max, basically describing a fight with golems or a trap encounter with associated outcomes of either coming out fine or getting 1 party member wounded/killed - could whip up a custom loca string to reference the party leader (the Storied Bard/Veteran Fighter etc) if desired. Every killed string should end with "a party member was §Rwounded§!/§Rkilled§!" or a variation of that, as a Necromancer might raise them, adding " Fortunately for them, they were §RRaised§! from death by the Necromancer." at the end of the description string

 #Trap encounters
 
 trap_clear_key_desc1:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nBefore we entered a room, our party noticed a very obvious tripwire in front of the entrance. The wire was cut without further incident, or knowledge of what it could have done."
 trap_clear_key_desc2:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nHalting the rest of the party, one of my companions pointed out a risen brick in the floor - a pressure plate. Judging from the holes in the wall facing the pressure plate, activating it would likely leave the victim littered with bolts. The party stepped around the trap."
 trap_clear_key_desc3:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nA party member kicking a rock noticed at one point that the rock seemed to phase through the floor.

 trap_clear_key_desc4:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party came across a room that we noted to have blood and crushed bones littering the floor.

 trap_clear_key_desc5:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a chamber in which stood a large statue.

 trap_clear_key_desc6:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a room with floor tiles inscribed with symbols, some depicting virtues and some vices. One of our party members recognized them from an old nursery rhyme and explained that they were in the same order as how it is sung. Upon testing the first few tiles, their theory proved to be accurate, and we safely passed this trap."
 trap_clear_key_desc7:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party encountered a large room with some strange wind streams flowing across it from two different directions.

 trap_clear_key_desc11:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large room with a pool of what seemed like fresh water. Testing the water however led to us discovering it was actually an odorless acid, so we went around it."
 trap_clear_key_desc12:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across an oddly featureless hallway. One of us decided to throw a rock down the hall just to be sure, and expected, its landing activated large blades that clanged against the opposite wall."
 trap_clear_key_desc13:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party passed by a dark room with what seemed like a little girl inside, whispering a nursery rhyme.

 trap_clear_key_desc15:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe group entered a room with three hallways and writings above each passage.

 trap_clear_key_desc16:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe found a rickety rope bridge over a dark, seemingly bottomless chasm. The party decided to go one by one, very slowly, to prevent it from collapsing."
 trap_clear_key_desc17:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a room filled with small statues made of gemstones, gold and even damestear. Despite protests, we all agreed to not touch anything and leave the room unaltered."
 trap_clear_key_desc18:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe passed a large door with an inscription that apparently read: "Treasure Room". We ended up ignoring this room, since it likely was just a trap. I hope it was anyway."
 trap_wounded_key_desc1:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of the party members clumsily hit a tripwire. Surprisingly, it didn’t trigger a trap, they just fell and hit their head. They’ll survive, but are now §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc2:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nA party member stepped on a well-disguised pressure plate. Dozens of bolts shot out of small holes in the walls and near-fatally §Rwounded§! them."

 trap_wounded_key_desc11:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large room with a pool of what seemed like fresh water.

Our translator claims to have an extensive knowledge of folklore, but they weren’t confident they could solve the riddle behind this room. Knowing they might be wrong, the translator volunteered to go first, and almost slipped into a pit with spikes. They were slightly §Rwounded§! from falling, but luckily only sustained minor injuries."
 trap_wounded_key_desc16:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe found a rickety rope bridge over a dark, seemingly bottomless chasm.
