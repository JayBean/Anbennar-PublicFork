 #Mission Tree Titles and Descriptions
 seinathil_senior_branch_title:0 "Make Amends with Istralore"
 seinathil_senior_branch_desc:0 "During the Lilac Wars, we fought on the side of the Rose Party against our cousins in Istralore. Tensions have been high since then, the word "traitor" thrown about with little care. These wounds will heal over time,  but healing them sooner than that could be helpful for us. After all, Istralore, despite being blood, is no doubt more powerful than us. We could pull some strings with friends like that..."
 seinathil_istralores_stage_title:0 "Usurping Istralore's Stage"
 seinathil_istralores_stage_desc:0 "Long have we stood on the sidelines, the backing band to Istralore's fame. We have grovelled at their feet for a place at the table, and have gotten little for it. It is time to pull some strings. \n\nIt shouldn't be hard. Our songs continue to be played all through Anbennar, stories of our glory travelling wide, while Istralore has been backsliding since the Lilac Wars. It's time to decide who's the real 'cadet branch' of the family."
 seinathil_conductor_ensemble_title:0 "A Conductor, an Ensemble"
 seinathil_conductor_ensemble_desc:0 "The claim has been made, there is no turning back now. Istralore's crown shall be our's, and with it we will take our rightful place on the global stage! We are not the lesser branch of the Silistra family, we have glory beyond what you know!"
 seinathil_deamoine_madrigals_title:0 "Deamóine Madrigals"
 seinathil_deamoine_madrigals_desc:0 "Deamóine is home to a noteable halfling population - they have their own culture, and musical styles, distinct from us, but are still focused on their traditional job of farming. They could be so much more! Madrigals are quite popular in Deamóine these days, if we were to develop the province a bit more, we could work towards exporting more than just fruits and vegetables, but more sheetmusic!"
 seinathil_deamoine_madrigals.tt:0 "All paper provinces will produce 15% more paper, forever. This includes future provinces."
 seinathil_esterfield_ballads_title:0 "Esterfield Ballads"
 seinathil_esterfield_ballads_desc:0 "Estallen is a land of love, of passion. Such topics are commonly the subject of songs, and Esterfield has many bards writing ballads to the fair maiden across the way. Perhaps with a bit of work, we could turn this into a lucrative business, exporting sheetmusic filled with love ballads across Anbennar?"
 seinathil_esterfield_ballads.tt:0 "All paper provinces will produce 15% more paper, forever. This includes future provinces. This stacks."
 seinathil_cardesti_neighborhoods_title:0 "Cardesti Neighborhoods"
 seinathil_cardesti_neighborhoods_desc:0 "The Cardesti are a people with a cursed and unfortunate history. There are many throughout Anbennar who would turn them away for fear of the curse, but we see a small kinship in these people's culture.\n\nThey, like us, have a strong passion for the musical arts, and their grand festivals and carnivals would fit right at home in our cities! We should invite these people to settle in our lands, permanently!"
 seinathil_freedom_triumph_title:0 "Freedom and Triumph"
 seinathil_freedom_triumph_desc:0 "What inspires a musical epic more than tales of good VS evil? Truly nothing. The legends of battles against Witch-Kings continue to touch the lips of bards to this very day, but it has been quite some time since Alarian Singkeep liberated our capital from Black Castanor. If we were to defeat a new evil, we could surely have new material to last us for years!"
 seinathil_freedom_triumph_tt:0 "Win a war against an Evil country"
 seinathil_rally_forces_title:0 "Rally Our Forces"
 seinathil_rally_forces_desc:0 "The region known as the Songbarges stretches from Esterfield to Deamóine, but we only control a small portion of this land. Truly, it is the 'song' barges, yes? Who better to rule this land than the true masters of song itself? We must work towards righting this wrong, by force."
 seinathil_singing_songbarges_title:0 "A Singing Songbarges"
 seinathil_singing_songbarges_desc:0 "The wars will be long and bloody, but the material our bards will get for songs of our victory will be song far and wide through the Songbarges, and beyond! They will know that this day Seinathíl reigns surpreme!"
 seinathil_rebuild_songbarges_title:0 "Rebuild the Songbarges"
 seinathil_rebuild_songbarges_desc:0 "The wars were, indeed, long and bloody, and while we have a lot of new material for our songs and poems, our citizens are suffering. Seinathíl isn't a land of tyrants, these new citizens will learn that we are here to lift them up! We should spend some time rebuilding, repairing this land we just conquered. Soon it will be even better than before, and the epics they write about our rule will be so many that they may even need to open new paper factories to keep up with the sheetmusic demand!"
 seinathil_bardic_college_title:0 "Renovate the Bardic College"
 seinathil_bardic_college_desc:0 "The Seinathíl Bardic College was founded hundreds of years ago, following the War of the Sorcerer-King. While it is still the best college in the world for learning of the Bardic arts, we would be lying if we said it couldn't use a little touching up. With some renovations, it will become not only as impressive as its hayday, but even better!"
 seinathil_reinstate_warsingers_title:0 "Reinstate the Warsingers"
 seinathil_reinstate_warsingers_desc:0 "When the Silistra family moved here in the 1300s they brought the Istralari Banshee to these lands. These Banshee soon morphed into an elite squad of warriors, famous for their music art called 'warsinging', and named for the founder of the Silistra dynasty, Istralania Warsinger. In the years since, the Warsingers have become little more than a footnote in history, but if we open a new wing in the Bardic College, specifically for the purpose of training new warriors in the art of Warsinging, we could have a ressurgeance on our hands!"
 unlock_merc_seinathil_warsingers_tt:0 "Unlock the mercenary company, the §YWarsingers§!, to recruit"
 has_unlocked_merc_seinathil_warsingers:0 "Has unlocked the §Yarsingers§! mercenary company."
 seinathil_imperial_ambitions_title:0 "Imperial Ambitions"
 seinathil_imperial_ambitions_desc:0 "For what purpose are we an Empire? Anbennar was founded hundreds of years ago, and for what? It was meant to cease the squabbling of petty warlords, keen on little more than ruffling their feathers and declaring themselves petty kings.\n\nAnd yet here we are, in the present, with Emperors doing little more than working to further their own goals, be it Dameria or Wex, the effect is the same.\n\nNo longer. We will throw our hat into the ring. Seinathíl is forcing its way onto the center stage. We are not a collection of states to be trampled on by a powerful Emperor, the Emperor is here to lead, to protect! And that is what we shall do."
 seinathil_songemperor_title:0 "The Songemperor"
 seinathil_songemperor_desc:0 "The weight of the crown is heavy. Songs have been sung for countless centuries on how absolute power corrupts, but we must stay true to our goals. The Anbennari dream is one of countless states working together. They will sing songs of our coronation, but they will not match even a percentage of the songs they will sing of what we will do with that crown."
 seinathil_united_anbennar_title:0 "A United Anbennar"
 seinathil_united_anbennar_desc:0 "Times have been troubled. News from across the seas shaking the very foundations of what we knew to be true. And yet, we have weathered it. Anbennar is united once again, for one common goal. And we shall reach it."
 seinathil_anbennar_dream_title:0 "The Anbennar Dream"
 seinathil_anbennar_dream_desc:0 "The Empire of Anbennar was designed for a very specific purpose. After the fall of the Jexisian Empire the region was a mess, with squabbling warlords fighting over whatever scraps they could find. The Grand Summit of Aranthíl changed all that, and the Empire was formed to move our lands together in peace. We are seperate, but also we work together for a better life. That's what the Anbennar Dream is. We should spread this dream far and wide."
 seinathil_fledgling_fugue_title:0 "A Fledgling Fugue"
 seinathil_fledgling_fugue_desc:0 "Our true journey starts here. Seinathíl is in a dangerous position, sandwiched between those who would see us brought to harm, but we will weather it, and by the end, they will be singing undending tales of our brilliance, so enticing that many will be entranced, wishing to immigrate to our lands so they, too, may get just a grasp of that limelight."
 seinathil_swelling_seranade_title:0 "A Swelling Seranade"
 seinathil_swelling_seranade_desc:0 "Its not enough to shine, we must outshine. A true musician's path is never complete, until all eyes are on them. This brilliance will shine far beyond our walls."
 seinathil_mighty_minuet_title:0 "A Mighty Minuet"
 seinathil_mighty_minuet_desc:0 "As our legends grow, so too do our forces. A soldier looking to stake his claim and make his fortune realizes that Seinathíl is a name to respected, a brand of quality. And with him, we shall continue our legacy."
 seinathil_climactic_concerto_title:0 "A Climactic Concerto"
 seinathil_climactic_concerto_desc:0 "Music, for the most part, has been one of two things for the majority of history. A court musician would play a fancy show for the royal court, or a traveling bard would play for a few peasants in a bar. Today, we will invent a third way to experience music: the music festival! This giant event will be held every five years, and be a testament to the glory of Seinathíl's musicians! Thousands will come from miles around to witness the day's music."
 seinathil_seincourt_title:0 "Form the Seincourt"
 seinathil_seincourt_desc:0 "Our nation and the Bardic college, and its arts, have gotten further and further entwined. Bards and musicians are in the highest ranks of office, and the time has come to make our bardic supremacy official. With a simple decree, we will become the Seincourt, a government build around music and the stories produced from such.\n\nThe Bardic College will be uplifted as the organizer of all magic in the realm, and we will be able to focus on what we truly wish to, the spread of our songs and stories.\n\n§RWARNING: THIS WILL LOWER YOUR GOVERNING CAPACITY BY HALF. Plan accordingly!§!"
 seinathil_fight_muse_title:0 "Fight for our Muses"
 seinathil_fight_muse_desc:0 "The bards of Seinathíl have historically sung to the gods of the Regent Court, using them as their many muses. But two muses in particular have taken particular prominence: first, there's Ryala, who has consistantly been the voice to whom we sing for centuries. Then you have the more recently ascended Munas, the god of music.\n\nToday, those muses are in danger. Corin and her ilk are fighting to disrupt the court, and if we don't protect our muses, who will we sing to now?"
 seinathil_choose_muse_title:0 "Protected by our Muse"
 seinathil_choose_muse_desc:0 "With the Regent Court secure in Anbennar, we will breath a sigh of relief. But it wasn't just mortal hands that brought us here. We have the court itself to thank for this victory, and our muses especially. But which specifically helped us here, in our time of need?"
 seinathil_choose_muse.tt:0 "Upgrades either Ryala or Munas as our Patron God."
 seinathil_new_allies_title:0 "New Allies"
 seinathil_new_allies_desc:0 "We are in a precarious situation. After the Lilac Wars, old alliances broke down, and we are alone and vulnerable here, threatened on all sides. We need to find a new friend here, one who will stand by us in our time of need."
 seinathil_bard_support_title:0 "Bards are a Support Class"
 seinathil_bard_support_desc:0 "Bards are not warriors. On the field of battle, you might assume one to be useless. However, that is simply not true. While a Bard might struggle alone, what they can do in support of others is where their real talents lie. We are like the noble bard, in many ways.\n\nAlone, we can't make it. But with our new friends, we can. Our bards will sing songs of our friendship, and together we will take to the battlefields, stronger than if we were apart."
 seinathil_bard_support.tt:0 "You and your ally will become bound as Bardic Allies. You get bonuses any time you're in war together."
 seinathil_war_friendship_title:0 "Songs of War and Friendship"
 seinathil_war_friendship_desc:0 "With our new friends, we have become a fearsome opponent on the field! United we stand, ready to strike fear in those who dare stand against us! They will sing songs of our victories!"
 seinathil_war_friendship_tt:0 "Win 5 wars with your Bardic Allies!"
 seinathil_song_blood_title:0 "Siblings in Song and Blood"
 seinathil_song_blood_desc:0 "We have come far. We grow closer to our allies with each passing day, and as our bond grows closer, so too do our battlebards grow stronger, more accustomed to supporting on the battlefield. With enough experience, we can achieve great things."
 seinathil_song_blood_tt:0 "Win 10 wars with your Bardic Allies!"
 seinathil_skald_allies_tt2:0 "You and your Bardic Ally will grow closer, and your bardic magics will grow stronger. Your bonuses in war together will increase."
 seinathil_support_mains_title:0 "Support Mains"
 seinathil_support_mains_desc:0 "We have nearly reached the limits of what bardic magics can do on the battlefield. Our seasoned veterans spread these tactics down to a new generation, which refines it further, until we are a seasoned machine. The perfect support."
 seinathil_support_mains_tt:0 "Win 15 wars with your Bardic Allies!"
 seinathil_support_mains_tt2:0 "You and your Bardic Ally will grow even closer. Your bonuses in war together will increase."
 seinathil_strengthening_bards_title:0 "Strengthening the Bards"
 seinathil_strengthening_bards_desc:0 "With the creation of the Seincourt, bards are crucial in even the smallest matters of state. We need to make sure they are well supported and loyal, or else this experimental governmental system won't get far!"
 seinathil_strengthening_bards_tt:0 "The Bards will refine their skills even further. Your bonuses in war with your Bardic Ally will reach their full potential!"
 seinathil_modernize_college_title:0 "Modernize the Bardic College"
 seinathil_modernize_college_desc:0 "The Bardic College, once the most impressive in the land, has started once again to fall by the wayside. It is certainly impressive, yes, but as time progresses and new advances are made, it has a tendency to stick to more conservative methods.\n\nLet's revolutionize our college with a full rehaul and renovation! All the best and brightest minds, all the rarest books on the subjects of Enchantment. With this by our side, we should find it easier to research magic ourselves, and with such a glorious school, it would be criminal NOT to send future heirs to school there!"
 seinathil_modernize_college_tt:0 "The enchantment school of magic will have a §G+25% XP Gain Modifier§!, and you will have a greater chance of getting a mage heir!"
 bardic_college_xp_bonus_tt:0 "The §cBardic College§! will help [Root.Monarch.GetName] study this school: §G+25% XP Gain Modifier§!"
 seinathil_repair_swansong_title:0 "An Instrument Fit for a Bard"
 seinathil_repair_swansong_desc:0 "During the War of the Sorcerer-King, the legndary elven troubador Alarian Singkeep took the fort that would later be known as Seinathíl, using little more than music, a little magic, and his trusty enchanted harp, Swansong.\n\nIt has been many moons since that war, and although the school Alarian founded still holds his harp, on display, time has aged the beautiful instrument. It has lost much of its luster and is little more than an artifact of a bygone era, broken and unusable. It is time to fix that. With a little work, magic, and expensive resources, we can make Swansong sing again!"
 seinathil_repair_swansong_tt:0 "Enchantment: §TRenowned§! or better"
 seinathil_get_swansong_title:0 "Swansong"
 seinathil_get_swansong_desc:0 "With repairs complete, Swansong is more impressive than every before. But its true power cannot be unlocked without a truly skilled bard, ready to imprint upon it."
 seinathil_get_swansong_tt:0 "Enchantment: §OLegendary§! or better"
 seinathil_bards_north_title:0 "Bards of the North"
 seinathil_bards_north_desc:0 "Far in the frozen north there lies the land of Gerudia, known for its rough and rugged inhabitants. These Gerudians have a long storied history of music and tales, sung by those they call Skalds. They are quite similar to our own bards! Perhaps there's more in common between us than you'd expect! We should try to ally with these frozen northmen, there is much we can share!"
 seinathil_bards_north.tt:0 "Sends a missive to the skalds of the north offering an alliance"
 seinathil_skald_allies_title:0 "Our Skald Allies"
 seinathil_skald_allies_desc:0 "With our newfound allies, we have a much deeper appreciation for the Skaldic art than we originally did. It is similar to us, and yet different and unique in its own way, and all together quite beautiful. If we combine our songs further, we can accomplish geat things."
 seinathil_skald_allies.tt:0 "You and your Skaldic ally will become bound as Bardic Allies. You get bonuses any time you're in war together."
 seinathil_skaldic_teachings_title:0 "Incorporate the Skalds"
 seinathil_skaldic_teachings_desc:0 "With the modernization of the Bardic College, we should look for more classes and subjects to teach. Our old friends of the north, the Skalds, have taught us much just through casual conversation and our alliance, but if we invite them into the classroom in an official manner, our bards can learn directly from them!\n\nThis will have the unfortunate side effect of proably angering many of our homegrown Bards, however, who want to be the ones teaching classes, not some foreign northmen."
 seinathil_skaldic_teachings.tt:0 "You'll gain a new Mage Estate privilege, giving lowered tech and power costs."
 senathil_age_tt:0 "The owner of [916.GetName] will receive events pertaining to musical developments in this age over the next several decades"

 seinathil.1.d:0 "Poems and ballads are our major export, this is really nothing new. However, recently the stories the bards have been singing of our magnificent country have spread far and wide, and a large influx of immigrants have come to join in the stories and add their own fortune to our's! This benefits our entire nation, but to better feel the effects, we should direct these new families to settle in one of our provinces in the main heartland of our state. But where shall they settle?"

That's what the Anbennar Dream is, and now with our help, we've fulfilled that and more. We are united once again, and even more nations across Cannor have joined our ranks. But now that we're united, where should we go from here? We have a few options we could take, but what should our efforts go towards? We could combine our forces, increasing the armies and strength of the Empire. We could combine our economies, bolstering each of us in turn and sparking a new golden age in industry. Or, we could combine our brightest military minds, all the strategies we've developed seperate, forming together for a new purpose. Which should we choose?"

It has been many moons since that war, and although the school Alarian founded still holds his harp, on display, time has aged the beautiful instrument.\n\nIt has lost much of its luster and is little more than an artifact of a bygone era, broken and unusable. But nothing can be broken forever, and after a little work, Swansong is as beautiful as it once was, with new enchantments and Damestear-enforced strings. The legendary harp is now ready for our line to use. However, it must still be activated, and needs to be wielded and tamed by a truly worthy musician. It is said that the weapon chooses the wielder, but in this case it almost seems like that is literally true. We need to be enchanting before we can even hope to use Swansong to its full potential."

 seinathil.21.t:0 "The Renaissance Period"
 seinathil.21.d:0 "With the embrace of Renaissance ideas in our country begins a period of new art, and not just physical, but musical as well! The Renaissance period showed increasing freedom from medieval constraints as people began to research more into the cultural history of both Dameria and Castanor, with more variety in range, rhythm, harmony, form, and notation. This wasn't a retread of ancient ideas and movements, but a new movement born from those ideas, taking ancient conventions and relating them to the modern day. Not only ancient conventions and styles, but classical instruments were tinkered with as well, forming new sounds and instrumentation, such as the Giberdi basoon, and even early versions of the guitar.\n\nThis was also the birth of regular use of sheet music, with songs spreading further and faster than ever before! And they were needed too, as a larger influx of Troubadors was traveling the continent than in previous centuries. With the Greentide and the collapse of Escann, Troubadors from the Escanni courts were traveling far and wide, spreading these musical styles with them. This made it catch on quicker than music had ever before, and this quick spread would continue throughout the centuries."
 seinathil.21.a:0 "Interesting!"
 
 seinathil.22.t:0 "The Badarazi Period"
 seinathil.22.d:0 "Influences from the Greentide were more than just blood and battle. Although many would be loathe to admit it, orcish culture began to seep into certain areas, though in many cases it wasn't truly popular until someone else took the style and adapted it for Cannorian audiences.\n\nSuch was the case during the Badarazi period, where the Verne Camerata, a group of poets and musicians, began producing new music using common-practice tonality, or writing a piece in a particular key. This caught on very fast, and even more orcish influences filled in soon after, such as the introduction of the powerful driving bassline. Music also became larger, with the creation of the orchestra. Music wasn't just single bards anymore, it was an experience, grand and serious!\n\nSome stories say that when one of the members of the Verne Camerata first heard orcish music, he asked the musician what he called this fantastic music. The orc responded "Bada-orazi", which means "New Song", as in he had not named the song yet. The Vernman, not knowing orcish very well, liked the name and used it from that moment onwards as this style of music, which was quickly picked up by others."
 seinathil.22.a:0 "Fascinating!"
 
 seinathil.23.t:0 "The Silnar Period"
 seinathil.23.d:0 "By the early 1600s Badarazi music was falling out of style for many reasons. It had become overly complex and hard to digest. Many powers of Cannor stumbled, facing defeats from a united Small Country and other threats, and the orchestral sound of Badarazi became associated with Witch-Kings and tyrants. In contrast a new movement quickly swept into the hearts and minds of Cannorians, featuring a return to simplicity and immediacy of appeal. This movement was spearheaded by many halfling bards who's music caught on at this time, a large influx of them from the recently free Small Country.\n\nThe name means "Of Paradise", as these pieces were simpler, with more song-like melodies, and carried concepts of uplifting paradise, even in the bleakest times. This music was not as much court music as it was city music. After the style was solidified in the Small Country more unique styles came out of the many republics across Cannor, inspired by their lives and living spaces, carrying strong emotions that carried across easier than music from earlier periods."
 seinathil.23.a:0 "Interesting!"
 
 seinathil.24.t:0 "The Passionate Period"
 seinathil.24.d:0 "With the embrace of Enlightenment ideals, music began to change and evolve into something brand new, a new movement that took the emotional intimacy of the Silnar Period and ran with it. The ever-decreasing cost of print and the spread of publications and literacy to the masses invigorated the music industry, and as a result, music became more individualistic, emotional, dramatic, and often filled with a narrative beyond just the sound of the music. As new bright minds popped up all over Cannor, new music popped up with them, inspired by all the great literature, art, and mechanical wonders of the period. It was also often quite sarcastic and artistic; many older races found it very obnoxious."
