  miremaw_fernmunchers_title:0 "The Fernmunchers"
  miremaw_fernmunchers_desc:0 "The grand, jellied swamps of the Serpent’s Vale yoink the little things that attack us into their sloppy depths. Too shallow a stance, too short a stride, too frail a frame; only by our size do we reside in our homes undisturbed, save the odd reckless-turned-food. But...the little things had even littler things frittering among their surviving numbers. For a long time now, these irtkroti, or goblins, have scampered about on refuse and peat like blighting crocodiles, scavenging from our cozy lives for no moss off our backs. Nimble and slick, these littler things begged and pleaded over many maws with simple, broken skurkha: “Goblin! Goblin friend!” Our bellies rumbled, but our brains churned: Can food be friends, or at the very least supplicants?\n\nWe granted mercy, a modicum of the peace and quiet we enjoyed, and look at them now. They fear our girth, laud their position in our order as the smallest and weakest, and even call themselves by new family names: Mouth Smashers, Poisonblade, Boganchor. Too many for our attention; we simply refer to these goblins as “Fernmunchers.” Just as the mighty giants commanded us to accentuate their greatness, we can do the same to these littler things. In fact, a particularly fearsome goblin, starry-eyed and reverent, yearns to see all ogres in the valley beneath one unstoppable banner. Might we elevate this lowly Fernmuncher into a paragon of the littler things?"

  miremaw_mapping_mire_title:0 "Mapping the Mire"
  miremaw_mapping_mire_desc:0 "Just as quickly as they departed, our Fernmunchers scampered back into our mighty bog capital. Straining to gain our ear, they shared that their tiny feet carried them around the entire Vale, noting each standing stone, ogre clan, and migrating fauna pack. We never thought these irtkroti could travel so far, so quickly, and surprisingly, so quietly. Transcribing their maps onto barkskin and boulders, we now behold the vastness of the entire valley. So many skurkholi, cousin tribes stuck in their ways, ready for our rule; we need only bring them to heel."

  miremaw_swamp_beasts_title:0 "Great Swamp Beasts"
  miremaw_swamp_beasts_desc:0 "The Assembly Terrace’s mossy steps remind us of the ancient giant cities of yore: grand, intricate, and derelict. But does the craftiness of the creators mean a tossed log if we can do with it as we please? But...what can we do with it? The shallow plateaus lack skurkhol comfort, but, aside from the flock-petrifying catoblepas and slavering dire wolves, our cozy aurochs, petite rams, grumbling worgs, and unnerving dire lambs adore the location’s mountain water, mushy soil, and ankle-high grass. Let us clear out and enclose the terraces for our herds’ future as lovely morsels."

  miremaw_northern_neighbours_title:0 "Northern Neighbours"
  miremaw_northern_neighbours_desc:0 "Emerging from the twilight forests north of the Serpent's Vale, Fernmuncher sentries scamper into the capital hall. Our [Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] grumbles as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] meal is halted by these flustered irtkroti, but they prostrate themselves and beg, knowing full well that their lives might become morsels - yet still they protest. Swearing with their own eyes, they report witnessing ever increasing numbers of orcs, though strangely stoney and muted compared to the ones we know. [Root.Monarch.GetName] grinds [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] teeth in disinterest, but the goblins impart startling details. The new orcs move as organized groups, flutter a foreign banner, and appear to be trailblazers - a first wave signaling more to come. Mire Maw must know if these newcomers are hapless migrants, or if these “gray orcs” look to rule land rightly ours."

  miremaw_conquering_pass_title:0 "Conquering The Pass"
  miremaw_conquering_pass_desc:0 "The endless woods of Loethrg Tanvlis, or “Northern Pass,” billow with frost in mimicry to how fog blankets the Serpent's Vale. Despite this similarity, the lands beyond Uthojan's Eye are strange. Cramped trails barely wide enough for an ogre’s width, patches of shallow mud bitten by trace permafrost, and, annoyingly, the strange nakturkhi. But we are not as we were. Mire Maw, rallied by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], has chopped paths for skurkhol soldiers, smashed log forts, and crushed organized resistance in this vast wilderness. The conquered “Gray Orcs” vow that their brethren further west grind weapons and even now ready to liberate their kin, but we press onward. And onward. More nakturkhi. But none strong enough to bar Mire Maw’s banner from fluttering over the isolated mountains of Bartortali and vast waters of Sashkras beneath it. Loethrg Tanvlis shall be ours!"

  miremaw_distant_cousins_title:0 "Distant Cousins"
  miremaw_distant_cousins_desc:0 "After hammering against waves of nakturkhi further west, our ogre settlers began clearing parcels of wood for skurkhol habitation. But in those moments, we felt the eyes of the forest upon us. Our frontier warriors, hungry and nervous, delved into the wilderness in search of gray orc stragglers or scouting parties, but instead of hiding little things, we bumbled into skurkholi...or, at least, they appeared to be at a glance. Widely different proportions, strange fashion, tiny protruding tusks not unlike our supplicant orcs, and a mix of mossy green and icy blue skin. But as they spoke and raged at our intrusions into their territory, we caught glimpses of familial familiarity. “Do you speak ogre?” our first contacts asked. “Are you ogre? What clan?” They squinted and scratched their fern-filled manes, only mildly familiar with the terms skurka and skurkhol. They instead corrected us, imparting an old word with new meaning: Roelt. Troll. With our distant cousins now in the bounds of Mire Maw’s borders, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] calls for a reunion to address these sylvan siblings and their place in skurkhol society."

  miremaw_tribal_consolidation_title:0 "Tribal Consolidation"
  miremaw_tribal_consolidation_desc:0 "Tomorrow. Another time. Get out of my glen. Stay out of my fetid lake. I’m busy growing lichen. A hundred excuses for staying apart, away, disorganized; but no more. The sky-piercing mountains warble with harsh winds, portending great change; at least, that is what our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decrees. Our tribe refused to stir when we bellowed, so they shall jump when we bludgeon their kneecaps; only then can Mire Maw’s sluggish heart beat. Bringing the Vale to heel necessitates aggression and violence, and we aim to oblige, starting with our lazy tribes"

  miremaw_old_capital_title:0 "The Old Capital"
  miremaw_old_capital_desc:0 "Dull moss-veiled hills lord over the southern shores of Uthojan’s Eye, but we remember the time before this amorphous slope in Zalenaktrotav joined the untended landscape. When the Lekilnhrisgigori, icy giants and siblings of our former masters, descended into the Serpent’s Vale, they forced us to yield to their king Kranmas. Our tales still recount how the giants enslaved us to build roads and structures from the edge of our swampy homes all the way to the fabled Beastbane’s den, all for the Lekilnhrisgigor’s advantage. For our duties, the benefic giants elevated the vile Clan Bigcleaver (now fallen and gristle) to rule over all skurkholi in the Serpent’s Vale.\n\nThe masters’ gesture founded Ghavamregh, or “East Kingdom”, and anointed the first ogre kings with court, capital, and a runestone of authority. But history laid all to rest. The Ice Giants: scattered and broken by Beastbane’s ilk. Clan Bigcleaver: consumed from without and within as their kingdom collapsed. The old capital: deserted and forgotten, reclaimed by the bog. The runestone: fallen during Ghavamregh’s decline. Gazing across Uthojan’s Eye, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] counts the countless lights of the heavens. Not just the Serpent's Vale bends beneath [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], but the very stars as well! And in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] flash of monarchical ingenuity, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] orders the new capital’s name: Ks’velo Jarnsk."

  miremaw_united_swamp_title:0 "United Swamp"
  miremaw_united_swamp_desc:0 "Mist rolls in from the top of the Serpentspine like bubbling ram’s milk over a cauldron’s lid, setting a chill across miles of tended terraces and cozy bogs. Cave entrances, dark maws into the depths of the earth, quake as we stroll along the sunlit valley. The frozen north, from where the Ice Giants descended and fled, swirls in serene silence. Up and down the Serpent’s Vale, each ogre shouts praise of Mire Maw and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. From slobbering clans to a unified nation, we’ve reshaped the whole of Mossmouth life for ages to come, but despite the valley’s bountiful future, our stomachs rumble; hunger demands action. Gazing outward, we recite our warding prayer: We are skurkholi. We are Mire Maw. And the Serpent’s Vale is ours."

  miremaw_swamp_agriculture_title:0 "Swamp Agriculture"
  miremaw_swamp_agriculture_desc:0 "Plumes of gray smoke join the mountain mists bearing down the valley. Situated along Mire Maw’s fertile terraces, new structures, topped by obelisk-like chimneys, carry sugary fumes into skurkhol life. It started incrementally as our farmers cleared out segments of untended land mired by giantheart, a pest for other produce and space. Whether in aggravation or ingenuity, a brazen ogre burned the tree-weed’s mighty bows, only to notice the plant’s coarse interior boil and bubble. Curious, they tasted the moist core: juicy, sappy, salty, and perfect as pickling juice. Immediately a savory hit, giantheart captivated our people’s hearts and palettes, but despite its prevalence, starting random fires in a damp swamp one tree at a time couldn't satisfy demand. So our farmers, wise and large, thought of a solution: what if we cultivated the trees somewhere closer to home? Now processing furnaces and giantheart orchards litter the valley, cementing Mossmouth Ogres as the premiere swampy stewards."

  miremaw_eastern_kingdom_title:0 "The Eastern Kingdom"
  miremaw_eastern_kingdom_desc:0 "While the towering giants mastered the world, our ancestors languished as fodder for their empires until we rose up and consumed them. But we are not our enslaved ancestors: the little things answer to us, and we see deceit and betrayal before it blossoms into rebellion. When we slept isolated in our bogs in generations past, we only reacted when outsiders trampled our fences, burst into our hovels, and demanded our heads. But we are not our content forebears: the Vale thunders with industry and our hands grasp for growth. When old Ghavamregh consumed itself, we withered and weakened until the little things knocked us down. But we learned from the tyrants of Clan Bigcleaver (now fallen and gristle): our neighbors fear our steps, we feed our bellies without weakening our grasp, and the stars themselves all congregate in one place to acknowledge our reign. No, we are more than our people’s failures. We are modern skurkholi for a modern age. Not just Mossmouth or Mire Maw, but a true kingdom destined to rival that of any skurkholi state on Haless. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] yearns to mark this new era, and so we shall. Tear low the runestone in Ks’velo Jarnsk! Fetch the masons! For today we mark a kingdom resurgent! All hail [Root.Monarch.GetName], monarch of the Kingdom of Ghavamregh!"

  miremaw_ogre_fortifications_title:0 "Ogre Fortifications"
  miremaw_ogre_fortifications_desc:0 "Mire Maw’s influence inches along the tractless swamps of other skurkhol clans, and as we’ve moved forward, so too have our foes. The province of Shavturkad, a major ingress to our core lands, borders Avlurmogh, the “West Mouth,” from which the little things pour out. Not just the pliable but industrious goblins, no: the orcs, little tusked ogres with dark skin seeking challenge, the squat, hairy dwarves pining for a home long ruined, and the occasional cluster of scaly kobolds lamenting their slain or slumbering dragons. As delicious as these interlopers can be, their organized bands, vainglorious armies, and skittering tribes plague our new ogre settlements in the region. To deter these unwelcome visitors, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] proposes a simple plan: dig a grand trench camouflaged from the little things along the shallow marshes in the region, set skurkhol soldiers to keep watch, and then smash the squishy heads of any foolish enough to traverse the deadly boundary - Only then can our swamps breathe easy."

  miremaw_khebur_ktar_title:0 "Khebur Ktar"
  miremaw_khebur_ktar_desc:0 "The little orcs with dark skin and tiny tusks cry out from the mountain’s maw, issuing challenges without cease. Mire Maw hungers to answer, but the nakturkhi, despite their size, fight tenaciously and in great, overwhelming charges. How can we battle in their dark caverns, hungry and cramped, against a defensive foe so resolute and reckless? A squat ogre groans of a plan - let them attack first. Several clan leaders, blinded by hunger and bloodlust, issue protest, but the skurkhol explains further: Let them tire in the muck and break against our khebur ktar, or “valley citadel,” and then strike when opportune, routing their forces and pursuing the stragglers back into the mountain. Not only will they lead us through the caverns like Fernmunchers through the Vale, but they’ll sustain our warriors in the unknown dark. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] finds this prospect of food and conquest delicious."

  miremaw_grand_feast_title:0 "The Grand Feast"
  miremaw_grand_feast_desc:0 "The tusked little orcs fled for their lives and retreated up the Ghavmogh and Avlurmogh, just as we anticipated. Pursued through hallways spacious enough to fit our girth, their meager defenses failed to stop our march. Even as we reached the grand holds of the scattered dwarves, the lavish structures, cluttered with ruin and debris, did not slow us down; district by district, we found the defenders, squashed their leaders, and left their warriors broken. Squatting in a ruined throne room wreathed in nakturkh art and trophies, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] scans the huddled and defiant faces of the vanquished. Mire Maw hungers for a taste of the spoils, but even broken, the determination burning in the eyes of these little orcs, these nakturkhi, reveals something more: strength beyond size. Just as we spared the irtkroti and allowed them to become respectable Fernmunchers, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s mind wanders: what use are these orcs to Mire Maw?"

  miremaw_subjugate_depths_title:0 "Subjugate The Depths"
  miremaw_subjugate_depths_desc:0 "No matter how bright our patch of swampy heaven is, we stew a pot surrounded by rapacious little things. Dealing with these threats occupies our fledgling nation’s greatest minds, and so Mire Maw grumbles on our history for strategies. Recalling our predecessor Ghavamregh, we dread that dark age: ogre devoured ogre, clan fought clan, and the weaklings merely poked and prodded without cease. Looking further back to when the giants ruled us, they fell from power and splendor, not from without, but from within. Aside from lacking a keen eye, what enabled the risgigori to claim the world in their titanic grasp? Well, they allowed us to skim about the edges...not unlike the goblin Fernmunchers. And when we thundered about against their wishes, they snapped us back into shape...strangely similar to the nakturkhi. An idea bubbles like marsh pitch. By pacifying the little things in the mountains, we fulfill the cycle of risgigor and skurkhol, of giant and ogre, of subjugator and subjugated, save for one key detail: we anticipate betrayal as it burgeons. Rally the ogres, rouse the troops, for the mountains teem with tiny boots ready for Mire Maw’s suzerainty."

  miremaw_riches_of_mountains_title:0 "Riches Of The Mountains"
  miremaw_riches_of_mountains_desc:0 "From defiant shouts to compliant squeaks, the dark of the mountains have learned to shudder at a skurkhol’s stomp. The little things, crammed in their caverns and holds, answer our decrees with zeal lest they grace our gullets, and, beautifully, these compliant subjects lob praise and treasure upon our envoys in the hope that we leave briskly. But our hunger needs to be measured, lest we weaken our servants and engorge ourselves to the point of sloth. By establishing runestones of our own in our subjects’ capitals, our helots know Mire Maw’s expectations: when we hunger, how voracious our appetite, which little things order the rest to fulfill these demands, and what happens if they fail."

  miremaw_cave_ferns_title:0 "Cave Ferns"
  miremaw_cave_ferns_desc:0 "Amartaathall has teemed with goblins ever since we stomped down on the Black Orcs plundering the ancient dwarven hold. But as we expand outside the Serpent’s Vale and into the Serpentspine, our Fernmunchers pout in nostalgia over the long forgotten caves they once called home. Such discontent serves as fertile grounds for displeasure and rebellion, so let us grant them their request for their loyalty and service to Mire Maw. Immortalized upon a runestone, we decree that: 1) Fernmunchers may, when not impressed by skurkhol clans, travel freely about the whole of Mire Maw’s realm without harassment save for skurkholi laws, 2) impeding Fernmunchers from their travels is punishable by devouring, and 3) loyal irtkroti are guaranteed a home in Amartaathall’s neighboring holds of Vhilstein, Thalldon Sokli, and Dzimprala."

  miremaw_miners_of_mountains_title:0 "Miners Of The Mountains"
  miremaw_miners_of_mountains_desc:0 "Jujguri: the hairy little things who built the monumental yet abandoned holds, who laid the derelict rails that blaze through the cavern dark, who ordered the very mountains before their fall - now supplicants to Mire Maw. They speak of their forebears and abandoned gods through sweating brows and fearful gazes, and as they should: even the most zealous fears our hunger. But in [GetYear], we issued a demand to our dwarven subjects: journey to Amartaathall for a feast to decide their future. The rumors churned, mixing hopes of reclaiming their ancient empire’s seat with dread of the menu at this feast. But fearful of rejecting our demand and earning our wrath, our dwarven subjects made the journey. When they arrived before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], our great ruler contemplated the decision before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]: to make devotees or to devour."

  miremaw_precious_minerals_title:0 "Precious Minerals"
  miremaw_precious_minerals_desc:0 "When we claimed the Serpentspine’s gaping caverns, we also inherited its old problems: rickety pathways, condemned structures, and broken mechanisms, most of which rarely accommodated skurkhol dimensions. But for all the hardships and frustrations, our little subjects unearthed countless wonders lost in the dark: diamonds, rubies, platinum, iron, copper, gold, silver, and even fabled slivers of mithril. Rather than feed us with morsels or sacrifices, they’ve instead reopened these long abandoned mines to appease our appetite for wealth. Though it’s rarely as tasty, the allure of gem and metal glimmers as warmly as a bubbling stew."

  miremaw_settling_pass_title:0 "Settling The Pass"
  miremaw_settling_pass_desc:0 "Lumbering steps, felled trees, and fresh foundations; piece by piece, Loethrg Tanvlis bends to my ogre strength. The largest example of a khebur ktar completed to date, the Northern Pass’ great trench successfully defends against orcish and human incursions. As word of this mighty bulwark reaches the homeland, eager ogres migrate to the area, terraforming the boreal backwoods into homey swamp homesteads. Before long, Loethrg Tanvlis will brim with one of the greatest concentrations of Mossmouth Ogres outside the Serpent's Vale itself."

  miremaw_hegemon_of_pass_title:0 "Hegemon Of The Pass"
  miremaw_hegemon_of_pass_desc:0 "Fernmuncher scouts return home with information for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] about the latest expanse of Loethrg Tanvlis. Despite concentrations of Gray Orcs and the occasional troll, they’ve counted increasing numbers of a new creature: little things like stretched dwarves, but without bountiful bushes of hair or squat resistance. As our nobles laughed at the odd image, our loyal irtkroti’s moss paint sketch strangled the laughter in our royal court’s throats. Admaijai. Humans. Kin of the “Beastbane”. Conquerors of our lost swamps far, far to the West. The assembly looks to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] for action against these ancient foes, but the skurkhol ruler smirks. “We are different now. Stronger. With the East Kingdom’s wealth, we can construct a grand valley citadel to encompass the entirety of the Northern Pass. Carve the ground, fell the trees, for no human shall pass lest they cross the peerless peaks or the endless frost.”"

  miremaw_northern_bulwark_title:0 "Northern Bulwark"
  miremaw_northern_bulwark_desc:0 "The longer we travel, the less things change. Past the vanquished Gray Orcs sit increasingly frigid lands hemmed in by a massive lake not unlike that of the far East. A mountain range, puny compared to the Serpentspine, includes new yet familiar inhabitants: even icier roelts, scattered nakturkhi, and hardy admaijai who ride the deep blue as easily as we press through a swamp’s depth. Ghavamregh’s ambitions sour at the prospect of chasing these new enemies into the endless white, and so by order of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] in [GetYear], the kingdom has issued a boundary of settlement. Beyond the mountains and furthest khebur ktar hemmed in permafrost, ogres would have to fend for themselves like the lonesome trolls. With another defensive periphery set, prospective skurkholi have quickly filled in the surrounding lands, turning the northern bulwark into the rim of Mossmouth settlement."

  miremaw_end_of_gray_kingdom_title:0 "End Of The Gray Kingdom"
  miremaw_end_of_gray_kingdom_desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]: sovereign of Ghavamregh and all its subjects, stalwart door to Avlurmogh and Ghavmogh, steward of all swamps mossy and green, warden to the great Loethrg Tanvlis, and now despoiler of the nakturkhi’s “Gray Kingdom,” or at least what remains of it. Atop a stone throne ferried all the way from Ks’velo Jarnsk, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] accepts from skurkhol generals offerings plucked from the fallen citadel. As Ghavamregh’s banner flutters on the highest cracked spire, warriors and nobles grind their teeth, anticipating the feast at hand. Let us accrue our guests, plan the menu, and ponder the fate of the fallen orcish kingdom."

  miremaw_dominance_in_reach_title:0 "Dominance In The Reach"
  miremaw_dominance_in_reach_desc:0 "The deep blue extends increasingly outward from our grounded reach. Though the inhabitants of both sides of this briny deep are majority human, they spiritedly protest comparisons to one another, even as our masons prepare [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s runestone decree for the region. They gallivant about this clan or that civil war, often involving colors: blues and whites, sometimes waving a red heart, not like the others in that place that wear blue, and certainly not like those barbarians across the blue. As our Fernmunchers tried to decipher the distinctions, we couldn’t help but reminisce about the divided goblin and orc clans in age’s past; but if this was how these admaijai wish to be addressed, then so be it. After all, it is only appropriate that we grant them the respect subjects deserve, especially after we install our law-granting runestones in their conquered cities. If they bemoan our terms, well, we shall see if they still see division when crushed together beneath our benevolent heel."

  miremaw_new_power_in_north_title:0 "New Power In The North"
  miremaw_new_power_in_north_desc:0 "Past the breached walls of Bal Vroren rest the admaijai divided among strange clans in forgotten lands: “Alien-ak,” “Cah-nor,” “Esk-un,” and more! But [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] senses fear and opportunity among these humans. No doubt our grip over the Serpentspine, the great feats and feasts of our conquests, and our reputation as fair overlords have reached their oblong ears. Our Fernmunchers, stealthy and observant, have even heard that motherly humans caution their progeny with threats about ogres taking them away to be devoured unless they do as they’re told. Wondrous! By demanding that they kneel or break, Ghavamregh shall make proper subjects of their kin and usher in a new age of politics in the North."

  miremaw_pipe_works_title:0 "Pipe Works"
  miremaw_pipe_works_desc:0 "Deeper than a giantheart’s roots, tendrils of stone and metal burrow through the old dwarven foundations. Overrun by moss and fungus, most of these tubes trickle stagnant slime, but a few still ferry fresh water. The method of their construction and maintenance sank long ago into lost history like a carcass in the bog, but as we fill the spaces of our domain, our farmers and settlements thirst. Our Fernmunchers, ever aiming to please, recount their own efforts to traverse and manipulate these water-carrying...things. Migli, the irtkroti call them: A strange turn of words for our own smoking pipes. Well these “pipes'' require nimble fingers to handle the teensy gears and powerful hands to reshape the stone and metal. Our masterful minds churn with possibilities: fresh water rivers filling Amartaathall’s fountains, reliable flows along the mighty terraces, and even relaxing pools fit for a king in Ks’velo Jarnsk."

  miremaw_shevril_mozob_title:0 "Shevril Mozob"
  miremaw_shevril_mozob_desc:0 "Bit by bit, we have strengthened the soil, curbed pests, and enclosed the grazing mounds, but despite our best efforts, the mountains have resisted providing that necessity of mucky living: water. Why would it, after all, with the migli cracked, dry, and silent? After years of little thing tinkering, healthy helpings of trial and error, and beautiful skurkhol refurbishing, the day arrived. As we flicked the giant lever, the mountain veins groaned and echoed: a trickle, then a stream, a current, a river’s flow. Water, pure and plentiful, flowed from the cloud-piercing peaks of the Serpentspine. As the fresh discharge cascaded down the terrace trenches, Ghavamregh reveled as masters of the Vale in a manner not thought possible since the ancient dwarves. With nigh-unlimited reserves, unusable or parched portions of the kingdom sink comfortably into fresh muck, swelling [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s popularity. To commemorate this great revitalization, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has ordered the runestone in Ks’velo Jarnsk to be renovated. Among adding Ghavamregh’s recent titles and conquests, the new Grand King’s Runestone now proclaims: “Mountain Tamer, who bent the veins of the earth to bleed,” “Pipe Master, of both leafy leisure and liquid life,” and, above all others, “Soklesh’vra in’Skurkholi’vra in’Shevril Mozob,” or “Domain of the Ogres of the Great Swamp.”"

  miremaw_our_roots_title:0 "Our Roots"
  miremaw_our_roots_desc:0 "With our push south past the Serpentspine’s edge, we’ve encountered warmer and calmer climes: dense forests, empty plains, odd flat terraces overgrowing with delectable plants, and a dizzying number of humans and orcs. As we daydreamed about more subjects for our glory, our hearts stopped as we glimpsed past the lazy rivers beyond our realm. Dense fog, wet soil, and flooded terrain: a swamp, warmer than those in the Serpent’s Vale, but otherwise cozy and inviting. And yet despite the invitation, a citadel towered over the swamp’s haze, posed at a river confluence as a foreboding gate to paradise. Could it be? Consulting Ghavamregh’s scholars and historians, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] learned a bitter but beautiful truth: this unknown land was, at least at one point, our ancestors’ home. Not motivated by a hungry gut or empty treasury, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decreed without hesitation: “A dream of a dream swells throughout the East Kingdom this day. The great hunger abates, but let us replace one appetite for another: of spirit and homesickness for a land we could only have ever imagined.”"

  miremaw_fall_of_magharma_title:0 "Fall Of Magharma"
  miremaw_fall_of_magharma_desc:0 "“Solid flesh hides many bones,” as the ogre idiom goes, and the remnants of the Kingdom of Maghargma embodied this saying more than any of our foes. While we were sitting in cozy muck, the margadoni, or “warlords,” clashed in unending conflicts, even as they knelt to a unifying mengur’m seated among Ghormalrisgigor ruins: a fallen throne fitting a fallen kingdom. But now Ghavamregh is ascendant, and we gain where the fallen rot. Let us pluck the ribs of division, crack the tendons of opposition, and ready the meal of communion as we make our homecoming to our ogre brethren."

  miremaw_home_in_west_title:0 "Home In The West"
  miremaw_home_in_west_desc:0 "When we struck down Maghargma’s despots and claimed the Ghormalrisgigor’s fallen sky-city, we marveled at the grand avenues sized for the risgigor’s great stature. Even as we resculpted the settlement, our impressions never dimmed of the giant’s home. But as Ghavamregh’s warriors stand atop the collapsed walls of “Baul Myers,” they nod, giving only silent remarks. Impressive, certainly...for the little things. But for ogres? Barely a bump against circumference and cannon. Staring out over the humid swamp air, a thought welcomed the conquerors: with enough dire lambs, a couple clans of Fernmunchers, ample giantheart plants, and a host of royal resources, this neglected marshland could be transformed into a home befitting Mossmouth’s name. After building a great khebur ktar around the fallen citadel, the area has swelled with ogres interested in the warm, quiet lands of our ancestors. Let none ever again drive us from our homes."

  miremaw_modern_ogre_empire_title:0 "A Modern Ogre Empire"
  miremaw_modern_ogre_empire_desc:0 "“Ogre sounds through solemn scholastic schools in the soggy swamps. Little things, lightly trembling, tend to our tasks with low turns, their heads held in place by our handsome heights. The East Kingdom: growing from groverling Mire Maw to a grand and glorious kingdom.” Penned by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] in [GetYear], the dragging doggerel adds to the ever-affluent prose composed by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s honoring Ghavamregh’s legacy, but beyond Ks’velo Jarnsk’s lakeside palaces where all stars dwell, the Vale fumes with warm gas and calm air. As fireflies dance along the dense foliage, the world has finally learned to leave the ogres in swampy peace. All hail Ghavamregh: ruler of the world, master of marshland, conqueror of the little things, wise and glorious, beneficious and bountiful, and a modern ogre empire."

  miremaw_ogre_mountains_title:0 "Ogre Mountains"
  miremaw_ogre_mountains_desc:0 "Generations come and go, and few alive today recall a time before Ghavamregh’s supremacy over the Serpentspine. From Amartaahall’s bustling halls to Khudigir’s bent overlook and along Er-Natvir’s great rail nexus, the mountains answer to one people above all others. As skurkha is spoken, stone bends and listens with supplicating patience. When skurkholi pry, the gems and mushrooms glide from the walls. Where the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s decrees hang, the little things obey without question. Ghavamregh heralded the fate of swamps and forests, but now we also command the very depths themselves. Maybe these “Serpentspine Mountains” deserve a better namesake reflecting their mighty owners: Skurkhol Gortali."

  miremaw_exerting_our_influence_desc:0 "Skurkholi. Ogres. Despite a few trolls quibbling over the term, our people stretch across the roof of the world. But as our boundaries swell westward, we also glance to the East, past the thinning forests of the Forbidden Plains. Loyal Fernmuncher scouts have encountered a mix of reclusive humans, the occasional troll, and an overwhelming herd of swift centaurs, but keenly for us, also foreign skurkholi: dried, swampless, and without a runestone denoting their right to rule, but skurkholi nonetheless. Mossmouth history recounts how our swamps came to be inhabited by refugees fleeing both East and West, and so it is a strange homecoming to see ogres struggling against one another, weakening the whole in a way not too dissimilar to Old Ghavamregh’s leadership under Clan Bigcleaver (now fallen and gristle). As their kings curse and scream proclamations of authority from fallen Maghargma, we should announce our kingdom’s ambitions over these squabbling clans. With bountiful food and crushing prowess, we can easily incorporate them into our fold."

  miremaw_consolidating_our_belongings_desc:0 "One ogre requires an acre. A giantheart terrace thirsts for forty gullets. A herd of dire lambs sate their hunger on at least a full auroch. All these hungers, demands, and expectations in a single day. But as Ghavamregh’s banner flies over our little things’ holds, we reconsider our possessions. What feeds an irtkrot district? How much blood spills during an nakturkh duel? How much pomade do jujguri require during an ancestral mockup? [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] bites down on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tongue, vexed by uncertainty. Wealth and prosperity flow, but if Ghavamregh should stand tall, we must account for every coin and morsel. Let us assemble our most trusted advisors to begin this grand undertaking."

  miremaw_transporting_goods_title:0 "Transporting The Goods"
  miremaw_transporting_goods_desc:0 "CLANG CLANG CLANG. A Fernmuncher dangles on a chord, her entire body rocking a skurkhol-built bell that sounds along the rail tunnel. A flash of firefly guts alight in a sealed glass lamp, signaling to a junction center. A perturbed jujgar, his beard frazzled after a sudden double-shift, curses in skurkha, “holiday call-ins.” A fellow engineer, a nakturkh in wool overalls, eyes the schedule, ignoring his coworker’s complaint as he tugs on a lever. A rail shifts. The guided carriage wobbles slightly as a skurkhol swamp terrace owner turns in her sleep, her long journey from Ks’velo Jarnsk graced with a short nap before arriving in Amartaahall for more business. Recently expanded and retrofitted, the widened rails and state-of-the-art carriages haul skurkhol weight and goods in equal measure up and down the Serpentspine. But as the revitalized railways hasten transportation beyond mortal ken and create entire economies out of the formerly dangerous and dark caverns, none benefit more greatly than Amartaahall. Turning the winding trek up Avlurmogh and Ghavmogh from a long day’s sore walk into a scant three-hour snooze, the rapid speed has seen the sleepy terraces of the Vale align with train timetables. Just as the rail guides the cart, so too does Ghavamregh guide itself to a bright and prosperous future."

Though the world only knows our love for all things green and fetid, our souls yearn to craft and create just as our ancestors did while in captivity. In truth, the devoured risgigori relied on us to build their structures, craft their weapons, and provide for their massive lives. Countless examples of our ancestors’ peerless craft, their methods lost to history...but it can be ours again, and so much more. By demanding precious materials as tribute from our mountain vassals, Ghavamregh can stoke the lost artistic spark that burns in our thick souls and bring it to new heights."

  flavor_miremaw.1.t:0 "The Ghavarmegh Runestone"
  flavor_miremaw.1.d:0 "Over two thousand years ago, the soldiers of Kranmas the Ice Giant entered the Serpent’s Vale. As heralds of our ancestors who had returned to the world, Kranmas’s giants demanded our submission: and we were grateful to comply. There was no greater honor than working for the giants.\n\nUnder their lead, we built towers to the heavens. We crafted fortresses, roads, and homes fit for giants. We lorded over the other Giantkin, and all the lands they controlled: and we did so not just as ogres, but as Ghavamregh, the “Eastern Realm.” The giants had chosen us to be their favorites.\n\nThe representation of our old power now decays before us. The Ghavamregh Runestone, once as tall as twenty ogres, lies overgrown and forgotten in the depths of the swamp. The Giant Rune of “RULE,” carved relentlessly into every side of it in spiraling fractals, is barely visible under moss and lichen.\n\nIn the years since the fall of Kranmas, our tribes and clans have warred for the Runestone. We saturated the swamps with blood, all fighting for control over the dying kingdom. We ate our power, and each other, and hollowed ourselves out until we were nothing. The Runestone was eventually abandoned, and left to rot, for it was so coated in the blood of ogres that none dared to claim it. We must restore it if we are to remake Ghavamregh anew.\n\nWe will not make the same mistakes. We will unite the ogres, and all Giantkin, against our enemies. We shall feast: but we shall feast on our enemies more than we feast on ourselves."
  flavor_miremaw.1.a:0 "We must remember that we are the kin of giants!"

  flavor_miremaw.2.t:0 "The Northern Forest"
  flavor_miremaw.2.d:0 "The giants once controlled the northern forests. To aid them, they sculpted two species into being: the ogres and the trolls.\n\nWe were created to build. The giants gifted us with the power to construct and create: we were given intelligence, strength, and architectural ability. From infancy, we craft miniature castles out of dirt and clay; as we age, we harness this instinct to build monuments, temples, and wonders of construction. We are, by nature and merit, an industrious and creative people.\n\nThe trolls were created only to guard. They, too, were gifted with strength, but it was not so that they might move great stones and construct beautiful things with them: rather, they were given muscle only to ward off other species. They were made to be henchmen, and so are naturally dull, stupid, and beneath us. There is good reason why we control the plentiful Vale, and why they only inhabit the harsh and brutal north.\n\nWe must remind the trolls that we, not them, are the favorites of the giants. We must show them who truly deserves to rule the entirety of the old kingdom of Ghavramegh."
  flavor_miremaw.2.a:0 "May the entire pass be ours!"

  flavor_miremaw.3.t:0 "Western Intruders"
  flavor_miremaw.3.d:0 "A squadron of Fernscouts, hunched-over and starved, come to us with grave news. They have spent the last few months evading monsters from the west: orcs, gray in skin, who have staked a claim to Giantkin lands. These Fernmunchers have been spying on the orcs, watching and surveilling them, but at great cost. Forage was sparse in the brutal cold of the Northern Pass, and the orcs killed any goblin scouts they found. Battered by raids and hunger, the squadron is a withered remnant of what it once was.\n\nA particular ogre, Gulog Fearmonger, has become enraged at the thought of encroaching orcs. He has proclaimed himself “Protector of the Fernmunchers,” and has made it his solemn duty to destroy the incoming monsters as fully as possible. He has invigorated our armies, told them stories of what we once were, and prepared every plan necessary: and now, he demands that we fight. With Fearmonger, and with the strength of our nation, these newcomers to the Pass shall fail. They are not prepared for the power of the ogres."
  flavor_miremaw.3.a:0 "More orcs for us to feast upon!"
  flavor_miremaw.3.b:0 "Let’s see how their orcs fare against ours!"

  flavor_miremaw.4.t:0 "Family Meeting"
  flavor_miremaw.4.d:0 "Trolls are not often nervous, but in the northern reaches of our territory-- in a village once made only of trolls, now occupied by our soldiers-- they find themselves terrified. They were not ready for a grand army from the south, nor one that could best them so easily in combat. They now try to play the role of grateful hosts.\n\nAs we walk through their homes, they prepare a feast for us in welcome. They roast deer, moose, and caribou on beautiful bonfires which reach up to the stars; they empty their storehouses just to appease our stomachs. They say they want to be our friends, and our allies. They want to be part of our armies, and help us conquer the north. With all Giantkin united, there is nothing we could not do.\n\nWe listen to their words as they tend their flames. We think about what we could do with trolls by our side, and we also think about what ogres could be with trolls in our stomachs. What do we choose to do as their clan leaders continue on about the benefits of mutual cooperation? Do we accept their offer, or push them into the fires they tend?"
  flavor_miremaw.4.a:0 "They will serve us!"
  flavor_miremaw.4.b:0 "They will be served to us!"

  flavor_miremaw.5.t:0 "Grand Amartaathall Feast"
  flavor_miremaw.5.d:0 "The smell of livestock, cooked whole, fills the entire hold. Thousands of cows, sheep, rams, aurochs, worgs, catoblepas, wolves, and pigs have all been slaughtered: and orcish servants now work at spits, rotating the un-butchered bodies over open flames. Fernmunchers mix lichen-sauces for seasoning, and swamp-brewers hawk their swill from stills across Amartaathall. It is paradise for an ogre, and disgusting for almost anyone else.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] holds the highest seat in the city that was once a capital for ancient dwarves, and later a capital for foolish orcs. Those orcs now surround [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], watching with concern as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] guzzles the flesh of a recently-killed ogre. The ogre had been a powerful and incredible warrior, and had been slain in the final battle to take the hold; the orcs could never understand how happy the ogre would have been to be consumed by his lord. Or, at least, they couldn’t understand right now.\n\nAs the servants look on, full of fear and disgust, [Root.Monarch.GetName] must make a decision. The orcs’ strength must be brought into the Mire Maw: but how? Are the orcs to be thrown into the flames, rotated on the very spits that they were just working, their strength consumed by the ogres? Or shall they be kept alive, more useful as servants than fodder, taught the ways of the feast?"
  flavor_miremaw.5.a:0 "We feast on fresh meat tonight!"
  flavor_miremaw.5.b:0 "They will serve us!"

  flavor_miremaw.6.t:0 "Second Amartaathall Feast"
  flavor_miremaw.6.d:0 "Teams of Fernmunchers season entire rothé, each stuffed with specialty serpentbloom and fungi. Dwarves work the bellows of ancient furnaces, cooking gigantic carcasses in furnaces meant for metal. Professional ogre chefs oversee it all, using the small species’ dextrous hands to finely chop the ingredients before we cook them. It does not matter that the servants have kitchen knives, nor great fires; there is nothing they could do, even if they tried. A goblin butcher can barely scratch an ogre.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] feasts on the luxuries of the Serpentspine, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] thinks about the choice [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must make. The dwarves once built the very hold [Root.Monarch.GetName] sits in: and they have also killed countless ogres while trying to reclaim it. Was this bravery, or idiocy? If it was in fact the former, is it better to reward them, or to consume them and take that bravery for ourselves? [Root.Monarch.GetName] discusses with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fellow clan leaders while dwarves sweat by the meat-forges and cutting-boards.\n\nIn this hall of old empires, with all the small and ancient species of the Serpentspine under our control, what shall be done with the dwarves? Do we use them as servants, as builders, and as the maintainers of these holds? Or do we consume them, and do it ourselves?"

  flavor_miremaw.7.d_1:0 "Purple-green kraken tentacles, fried in oil and zested with lemon; bloody-pink rothé filets, grilled to perfection and served with asparagus; lily-white leviathan livers, stuffed with herbs and glazed with honey. The fragrances of the feast float through Bal Vroren, symbolizing our victory like a triumphal march. These smells could only be produced by the Ulpralagma: “Feastfathers,” ogres drilled like soldiers to quell hunger with flavor and discipline. They take food from the Spine, from the Pass, and the Sea, and combine them into meals that no creature has ever crafted before. We eat in the bliss of culinary euphoria.\n\nThe centerpiece of the feast, more than any sea-beast or exotic seasoning, is the Gray Kingdom itself. The orcs of this region are delicious-- pre-salted by the sea, marinated in blood-- and their carcasses tell us the secrets of all Gerudia. The fighting spirit of their forefathers fill our veins as we dig into theirs, and maps of the region digest in our stomachs. The path towards a fulfilled dream of Ghavramegh has never been clearer."

We eat in the bliss of culinary euphoria.\n\nThe centerpiece of the feast, more than any sea-beast or exotic seasoning, is our contingent of loyal followers. Mixed in with the attending ogres and Fernmunchers are orcs, half-orcs, and ogrillions, each just as ecstatic as we are to partake in the banquet. We invited those of the fallen Gray Kingdom-- we are happy to feed anyone who will bend the knee-- and now lord over the city as its benevolent rulers. For so long, the world has despised us for our hunger and for our gluttony. Now, though, we show them our virtues: and those virtues can be found in the ecstasy of a perfect meal!"

  flavor_miremaw.8.d:0 "“GET OUT!” Lasugi bellows, chasing after Fezdot like someone who can’t quite catch a mosquito. Fezdot, wearing a backpack labeled “BOOM,” climbs up into the trees in desperation.\n\n“Waitjustaminute!” the Fernmuncher exclaims as he stabilizes his payload. “Justgiveme a TRY! Just let me MESS with them, and I’ll make them BETTER!”\n\n“You can’t ‘mess’ with the irrigation pipes, idiot!” Lasugi retorts. “You are wearing a bomb, and I’ll not let you destroyed what I’ve spent my whole life repairing! Do you think it’s easy to keep this place running? Are you not grateful for the swamp’s bounty?”\n\n“I am!” the goblin replies, enthusiastic with nerves. “ I just-- look-- look!” he says, pointing. “See that pipe up there? See how I’ve connected it all the way to the hold?”\n\n“Of course I haven’t! You can’t connect a pipe all the way to the hold from here! If you did, it would saturate the pipes. They’d be overstuffed, ready to blow! If they didn’t have a release anywhere, they’d...” Fezdot nods aggressively, then gestures for her to continue. “... they’d explode.” She slams her giant palm against her equally-giant forehead.\n\n“CanImakeitreleaseplease?”\n\n“...Fine. But I get to carry the bomb.”"
  flavor_miremaw.8.a:0 "A new era of prosperity for our swamp!"

  flavor_miremaw.9.t:0 "Ogrish Metallurgy"
  flavor_miremaw.9.d:0 "We have built so much out of nothing. From the days when we first settled our swamps, we have crafted architectural marvels: without steel, or iron, or brass, or copper, we used vines and leaves to found settlements and cities. We used our strength to bend trees into homes, dug rocks out of the ground with our own bare hands, and fashioned tools out of them to aid in the work. We invented methods of carpentry that could last in the mire, raised our homes above the bog, and irrigated mud-baths for recreation and rest. We did it all without using anything not grown in the Vale. We did so much, and we did it with so little.\n\nAfter so many years of swamp-bark and reed-rope, we finally have smallfolk miners to use as we wish. Iron, gems, mithril, gold: all of it now flows from them to us, precious and useful. We build towards the mountaintops with metal scaffolding; we use steel tools to craft with precision; we build temples fit not just for Giantkin, but for giants themselves. With metal-- beautiful metal, strong and durable like nothing in the Vale-- there is nothing that we cannot create. We fulfill our destiny of mastering construction. "
  flavor_miremaw.9.a:0 "We were made to be builders!"

  flavor_miremaw.10.t:0 "Return Of The Ogres"
  flavor_miremaw.10.d:0 "“They build towers as tall as mountains. They control everything from the Serpentspine to the sea. And they eat people. By Castellos’ dead heart, they eat people.” - Diaries of an Alenic Trader, Volume 2.\n\nFor years, Cannor did not know what to make of Ghavramegh. At first, we were only a rumor: they spoke of man-eating brutes who lived in swamps, but they could barely even imagine what we looked like. They learned that we conquered our way towards the world, but were puzzled when they found that we feasted on those they called “monsters.” For a while, this let them see us as no more than a nuisance that preyed only on undesirables. They did not care what happened to orcs, nor trolls, nor goblins, nor-- of course-- ogres.\n\nBut we kept growing, and we kept expanding. We raised our flag as we pushed towards civilization, and, soon, they could not ignore us. They prepared for a cataclysm, for a band of savages that would stop at nothing to consume all. They were not prepared for architects, administrators, and artisans. When we came to meet them, they could not understand us at all.\n\nWe now sit as the lords of the west, feasting while the world starves. Our ambassadors sit in every court, our goods are sold in every marketplace, and our subjects shower us in wealth and tribute. A worse fate has befallen Cannor than they ever could have imagined: for they do not get the honor of being killed, nor eaten, by Ghavramegh. Instead, they serve as our subjects. They will learn their place in the shadows of the giants."
  flavor_miremaw.10.a:0 "For a true ogre empire!"

  flavor_miremaw.13.t:0 "The Ogrillons"
  flavor_miremaw.13.d:0 "We have begat children with the orcs. Standing physically in-between ourselves and their other parents in stature, they bear our frames but orcish tusks. They are muscular, lean, and powerful: they will always be stronger than our servants, but they will also be shorter and weaker than us. They are foreign to their masters, and to their other parents: and yet we have come to rely on them. There are no greater diplomats between ourselves and our servants than those born of both ogre and orc.\n\nLong ago, when we were kings of Ghavamregh, the Ice Giants appointed us the liaisons between the Ice Giants and the Giantkin. We had been sculpted by the giants, and they trusted us: and so they allowed us to become not only sculptors of earth ourselves, but also emissaries. We brought orders to the other Giantkin, we kept them in line, and we were honored as the elite of our kind. We now follow in this grand tradition.\n\nWe have sculpted our own new species, made of orc and ogre. We have created “Ogrekind”: a people inferior to ourselves, but greater than all the rest. With our blood, and our power, they shall lord over our servants and make them obey. They will always exist as people between kin, and they will be grateful for their status as overseers."

When we need them, they are at our beck and call: but when they don’t, they enjoy the stagnant waters just as much as we do. What more could we want from our loyal servants? Let the Fernmunchers bask in the Vale’s glory: maybe it will do them some good. As they move in, we gain allies and subjects."

Giantheart trees inch towards the heavens before we cut them down for lumber and glue; crops grow without disease, perfectly adapted to the swamp; cattle graze on plentiful forage, happy and healthy before the slaughter. We grow everything we need for carpentry and consumption: and really, what else do we need? A beautiful bounty blossoms in the Vale! "

  flavor_miremaw.16.d:0 "Love rises from the bog gas bubbling in the swamp. Love wafts in the stagnant air alongside sulfur and sewage. Love lies in the mud, the tar, and the sap: and isn’t it beautiful? What more could an ogre want than what we have in the Vale? What’s more romantic, more enticing, than a marshy paradise? Is it really any wonder more ogres are being born than ever?"

  flavor_miremaw.17.t:0 "Flood!"
  flavor_miremaw.17.d:0 "After our “improvements” to the ancient irrigation system, more water than ever flows through the pipes of the Vale. Often, though, we get a sudden squall or a pipe bursts open, causing a bit too much water to flow towards the swamp. Sometimes, an ogre or Fernmuncher messes with the pipe system, exacerbating the problem and making it worse. And rarely-- only rarely-- all three happen at once. In these exceptional occasions, rains flood the pipes to capacity, some of them burst due to overuse, and an ogre or Fernmuncher makes everything worse by incompetently trying to intervene.\n\nIt is currently one of those very rare occasions. This is going to take a lot of effort to clean up."

  flavor_miremaw.18.d:0 "The bloodhoney pods grow thick this year, hanging heavy from carnivorous flowers in stagnant swamp-water. Mosquitos suck the blood of cattle and creatures, then land on the budding bloodhoney: the plant’s maw then grasps them, sucks the blood out, and ferments it into a beautiful, sticky, scarlet consumable. A painkiller and stimulant, bloodhoney is prized for its ability to keep builders and warriors alert through all of their struggles. Its only downside is mild hallucinations, a worthy sacrifice to persevere through pain. This year’s crop is more bountiful than ever!"

What we do know is that they’re here-- draped in all colors of feathers, big and small, with a dozen different flavors-- and they are completely delicious to eat. Why worry about the details when we can have a great feast!"

While boiling, add in just a few drops of sap from a giantheart tree: and be careful while doing so, else the sticky binding agent will ruin the mixture. Once everything has been boiled together, leave it outside on a swampy, humid night. In the morning, you will have made the greatest cheese in all Halann.\n\nQ’visk, that very cheese, is famous for its pungent lumps and solid clumps. The bitterness of the lichen mixes with salty sap, creating a combination that non-ogres despise with all their hearts: but who cares what they think? We know that there is no better use for milk, for lichen, nor the swamp itself. We have cheese unparalleled in quality!"
