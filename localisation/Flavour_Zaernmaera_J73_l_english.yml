 J73_1_1_a_cult_with_a_god_title: "A Cult With a God"
 J73_1_1_a_cult_with_a_god_desc: "How could one not worship Zaernsarlan the Ravager, the greatest Chendhyan since Ultarlanbeg himself? From humble beginnings, with his inherited Ezhudar on the backfoot, enemies on all sides, he rose to master of the Guaraddhi, victor over half a dozen kingdoms. Nonetheless, if we are to live up to his example we must glorify his memory. Formally recognising his apotheosis and establishing an institutional Cult of Zaernsarlan will surely cement his legacy – and establish a lightning rod for the tribute and offerings that will surely flow in to honour his death."
 J73_1_2_a_cult_with_a_city_title: "A Cult With a City"
 J73_1_2_a_cult_with_a_city_desc: "Zaernsarlan II was not just a conqueror. The Ravager expended great effort to integrate the ways of the Taychendi into Zaernmaera’s state, modelling his own steppe-kingdom off of the very warlord states he was fighting against. Part of this effort was to expand Haenbuddar, his capital, into a truly formidable city and the sedentary heart of his power – a vibrant mix of Taychendi and Chendhyan styles, with brick and marble temples, markets and baths standing alongside the great canvas-tent drinking halls, residences and animal pens that mark many Chendhyan villages. By erecting a great temple to Zaernsarlan using a mix of both styles we shall glorify the old king, creating a centre for the Ravager’s cult and furthering our centralisation at the same time."
 J73_1_3_a_cult_with_a_kingdom_title: "A Cult With a Kingdom"
 J73_1_3_a_cult_with_a_kingdom_desc: "It is often said that converts to a religion can be more zealous than those born to it. Such seems to be the case with Zaernmaera. In the mould of Zaernsarlan the Ravager, we have embraced Taychendi religion with open arms, with the hero-cults of Adezhegs past, that of the Ravager himself chief among them, occupying a central role in our realm. Now is the time to extend that embrace to the entire Chendhyan people – from our control of the holy isle of Assakadail, we shall use our influence to turn the steppe to the path of glory!"

 J73_2_1_munakles_sancturary_title: "Munakles' Sancturary"
 J73_2_1_munakles_sancturary_desc: "For the past 500 years, the Chendhyan peoples have been divided in two. On one hand the Chainbreakers, those who remain steadfast in the old ways, zealously seek the liberation of all in bondage, and wage war only in (often pre-emptive) defence. On the other, the Taychendized Chainforgers, who engage in the slavery of non-Chendhyans, and favour glory over security. Caergaraen, using their control of the holy sanctuary of the Askalyn, have been the voice of the traditionalists for centuries – but times are changing. With the Chainforger Zaernmaera on the march, there is no room for doubt – all Chendhyans must rally under our banner, or face destruction."
 J73_2_4_kings_of_the_conquered_title: "Kings of the Conquered"
 J73_2_4_kings_of_the_conquered_desc: "As the Chendhyans settled in to their new Ezhudar kingdoms in Taychend following the Emperor Ultarlanbeg’s conquests, many found themselves adopting the ways of their subjects to remain in power. Slavery of non-Chendhyans, offensive wars for glory rather than for security, even sedentary cities and fortresses – through this process, the Chainforgers were born. Now, with Chendhyans once again ruling over Taychend, it seems a similar process is occurring, as the people of the steppe become closer to the people of the east. It is only a matter of time before true synthesis results in a new type of Chendhyan – the only question is how far that synthesis will go?"

 J73_3_1_end_the_bloodcloaks_title: "End The Blood Cloaks"
 J73_3_1_end_the_bloodcloaks_desc: "The Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak: the very name sparks rage in every Chendhyan who hears it. Since the days of Olhokar, the religious zealots of Rakkabuttai have terrorised the Chendhyans of the Guraddhi in the name of “saving Taychend”, committing unmatched atrocities with impunity. Though Zaernsarlan II inflicted several defeats on them, he was never able to crack the imposing fortress at the centre of their rule – it is time to finish what we started, and destroy the Bloodcloaks once and for all!"
 J73_3_3_end_the_8th_larankar_title: "End the 8th Larankar"
 J73_3_3_end_the_8th_larankar_desc: "Erankar the Defiant. A formidable elf, and perhaps a greater conqueror than even Zaernsarlan. The reforged Larankar stands as one of the greatest threats to our survival, and so we must ride against them sooner rather than later. It will not be easy, but this is not the first time feline cavalry has beaten equine riders – trust in the strength of our mounts, and they shall carry us to glory!"
 J73_3_4_end_the_great_city_title: "End The Great City"
 J73_3_4_end_the_great_city_desc: "The perfidious Mudaliars, the cockroach-like rulers of Nanru Nakar, were twice vanquished by Ultarlanbeg and their heirs, first defeated on the plains of the Upper Kalavend, then driven to the underground of their “Great City” when they attempted to rebel against Geladhlan the Emancipator. Soon after Geladhlan’s death, they rebelled once more, throwing off Chendhyan rule, the first to do so. We will not make the same mistakes the first Asezhudar made. Ransack Nanru Nakar, and slay every Mudaliar we can find - the heart of the Kalavend will surely be ours!"
 J73_3_5_end_ebenanths_legacy_title: "End Ebenanth's Legacy"
 J73_3_5_end_ebenanths_legacy_desc: "Taychend is ours! Cries of victory ring out through the streets, as at last a Chendhyan realm rules over the lands below the Veyii Sikarha. But there is one job still unfinished. Our victory has heralded a new age for Taychend, but certain aspects of the past still haunt us – the times Chendhyans were defeated, subjugated, invaded.\n\nThe Gophirans have been dealt with – but in Orenkoraim, the last legacy of Ebenanth, the First Emperor, who scoured the Chendhya on some foolish quest, remains. The Gathyanavaida, the giant statue that guards the Gates of the Kalavend, stands headless, having been “decapitated” by a targeted attack from Ebenanth’s relic, Starshear. Why don’t we rectify that?"

 J73_4_2_build_the_first_sygoraet_title: "Build the First Sygoraet"
 J73_4_2_build_the_first_sygoraet_desc: "When Ultarlanbeg – or Ultarlan the Decimator, as the Taychendi know him – conquered Taychend, he divided his conquests up, giving each of the major tribal Ezhudars a portion of Taychend. These Ezhudars ruled from fortified Chendhyan cities, riding out from them to subdue any rebels who might challenge their rule. If we are to control the Taychendi, then we must rebuild these cities, dubbed Sygoraets by our advisors, to project our power in our new territories –  islands of Chendhyan culture in the sea of our subjects."
 J73_4_4_monopolize_the_iron_title: "Monopolize The Iron"
 J73_4_4_monopolize_the_iron_desc: "When Ultarlanbeg first conquered Taychend, the Iron Hills were an afterthought for him – after he had defeated the Sangamar Kings in battle, he left them under the watchful eye of the Darkalyndae, who allowed the Sangamars to remain in power. As the Chendhyans were expelled from Taychend by the rise of the First Gophiran Empire, all knew that choice to be a mistake – and it is one we will not make again. The Sangamars will be overthrown once and for all, and the mines of the Iron Hills will be placed under our strict control for good!"

 J73_5_1_sieze_the_gate_title: "Sieze The Gate"
 J73_5_1_sieze_the_gate_desc: "Despite our frequent conflicts over the years with the Taychendi colonies in the Guaraddhi, we do not despise them as a rule – were they more like Oremvand, we would certainly be more tolerant. A city which enriches the Chendhyans around their walls rather than raiding them, they are a far sight better than the slavers of Kannagarendi and the armoured monsters of Rakkabuttai, and Zaernmaera has often sold both native goods and Taychendi slaves to them. By treating Oremvand with mercy on one hand, and expelling the last of Kannagarendi’s Taychendi settlers on the other, we can set the scene for our future interactions with the Taychendi."
 J73_5_2_a_new_challenger_title: "A New Challenger"
 J73_5_2_a_new_challenger_desc: "Ameion, the Kheionai colony to the south of the Chendhya, has always been a target for steppe raiders. Rich and prosperous, their lack of cavalry usually leaves them slow to respond to Chendhyan incursions, especially given their preoccupation with the Basobhar to their west. Strange, then, that they seem to have become one of the greatest threats the Taychendi have ever seen. Ameion carved a bloody path through Taychend – and if we are unlucky they may well turn their attention to us. We must be ready for them: perhaps by studying what exactly changed to render them such an incredible threat?"
 J73_5_3_rebuke_the_kheionai_title: "Rebuke The Kheionai"
 J73_5_3_rebuke_the_kheionai_desc: "Ultarlanbeg conducted several campaigns against the Kheionai, first against the slaver-city of Empkeios, then against Ameion. Though determined and heavily armed, they fell beneath his advance just the same. If we are to truly follow in Ultarlan’s footsteps, then we must rebuke the Kheionai once more, and drive the Ambhen back to their ships! Taychend is ours for the taking, not theirs – it is time to show them that fact."
 J73_5_4_into_the_peninsula_title: "Into The Peninsula"
 J73_5_4_into_the_peninsula_desc: "With the heirs of Laskaris defeated, it is time to finish our conquest of Southern Taychend. Along the Vyech and beyond it lie many great cities, prosperous and proud, the heartless city of Nagar Vyechei chief among them – but they will fall just the same, as they did 500 years ago when Ultarlanbeg rode against them. Soon, we will gaze upon the eastern waters once more!"

 #Events  
 zaernmaera_events.1.t: "Leader of All Chendhyans"
 zaernmaera_events.1.d: "When [Root.Monarch.GetName] drew Saerasyar, the green-flamed sword, the crowd before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] erupted. There were cheers, chants, calls of “Glory!” and “For the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!” and “Heir of Ultarlanbeg!”. There was truth to that last point – there had to be. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Zaernmaera stood on the steps of the Askalyn – that famed sanctuary where Munazhlan had hid from the Slaver-Nobles and rededicated the very sword [Root.Monarch.GetName] held in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands to freedom. That famed sanctuary where Ultarlanbeg had proclaimed the union of all Chendhyans. Where [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would do the same.\n\n“Chendhyans!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] called, as the crowd quietened for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] speech. “From the edge of the blue-sand-sea to the savannas of Haebizyund, from the streets of Darkalyndar to the banks of the Agotham, from Assakadail to Haenbuddar – hear my voice!”\n\nAs heat and green light bathed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] raised the flaming sword to the sky, slowly and deliberately. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had to be careful, of course – [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] held the sword, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would not use it. Even this act, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] feared, could set it off. Munazhlan would not approve of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign – but that elf was long dead. The world had changed. The Chendhyans had changed. They would not sit idly anymore, waging petty raids out of “security” – soon, they would march to the ends of the world. And by the tip of the sword and the jaguar’s roar they would find it.\n\n“We ride to conquest, to victory – to those who follow me, I promise riches, slaves, lands… I promise glory!” The crowd roared in approval, the cry of “Glory” ringing out once more. “And to those stand against us? I promise death! I stand before you the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of all Chendhyans! Ride with me or be destroyed!”"
 zaernmaera_events.1.a: "The people of the steppe will conquer once more."

 zaernmaera_events.11.t: "Kneel to Zaernmaera?"
 zaernmaera_events.11.d: "Adezheg of Zaernmaera proclaims from the monastery of Assakadail that all Chendhyans must bend the knee to Zaernmaera and be rewarded with glory and gold, or be crushed\n\nWhat will our response be?"
 zaernmaera_events.11.a: "Accept"
 zaernmaera_events.11.b: "Refuse"

 zaernmaera_events.12.t: "[From.GetName] Accepted"
 zaernmaera_events.12.d: "Our emissary we sent to [From.GetName] has return with a letter of acceptance!"
 zaernmaera_events.12.a: "Glory to Zaernmaera!"

 zaernmaera_events.13.t: "[From.GetName] Refused"
 zaernmaera_events.13.d: "Our emissary we sent to [From.GetName] has return... with a letter of refusal?!"
 zaernmaera_events.13.a: "A poor decision"

 zaernmaera_events.2.t: "Countering Ameioni Tactics"
 zaernmaera_events.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] rubbed at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chin as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked at the papers before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. The Adezheg and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest advisors were in their war tent, huddled around a great table. They were pouring over reports about the Ambhen army, detailed sketches of their equipment, battlemaps of Laskaris’ engagements in Taychend. Every piece of paper seemed to paint a portrait of a bunch of military geniuses – but the warmachine they had forged had weaknesses, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could see that just as well.\nLaskaris had created a very heavy army – pikemen in the middle, unassailable from the front, then steel-clad guard hoplites on the flanks, whose strength came from their loose formation and bulwark-like durability. But they still had no cavalry of their own. A major issue… could Chendhyan riders overcome the guard hoplites by their own strength, focus on the flanks while infantry held the attention of the middle? Those pikemen though – they were not heavily armoured, forgoing large shields and steel armour for bucklers and linothoraxes. Concentrated arrow fire could decimate them, should they get through their defences.\nOr maybe they could just charge, straight forwards. Shock and awe, the way of our ancestors! To charge against a wall of pikes was certain death – but jaguars can leap high. Stretch the line out, so the Ambhen backlines can’t hold their pikes up, then jump? They’d need many riders for that. [Root.Monarch.GetName] shook [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head – either of the three tactics could work, but they would need to settle on one definitively."
 zaernmaera_events.2.a: "Hold them in place with infantry, then assault their flanks."
 zaernmaera_events.2.b: "Do not directly engage them – bleed them dry with a thousand arrows."
 zaernmaera_events.2.c: "Massed cavalry assaults have never failed us before!"

 zaernmaera_events.3.t: "A Crisis of Identity"
 zaernmaera_events.3.d: "There is debate in our ruling elite over whether we should embrace the change or hold on to our own martial traditions.\n\nWhile our people have embraced Taychendi customs and culture, our elites learning greatly from the warlords of the east, one area in which Zaernmaera has remained staunchly Chendhyan is in our military. The backbone of our strength, the tribes have invested heavily in traditional feline cavalry, supported by lightly armoured Chendhyan warriors on foot. However, as we expand our borders and control and become a more Taychendi empire, the calls to adopt the Taychendi military system, with strong regional commanders and a delicate balance between cavalry, heavy infantry and light infantry, have become stronger by the year. While the Taychendi are undoubtedly much more amenable to outside military innovations, many say sticking with the tools that won us the empire is the only way to keep it. Ultimately, the choice is yours."
 zaernmaera_events.3.a: "Adopt the doctrines of the Taychendi."
 zaernmaera_events.3.b: "Keep Chendhyan military doctrines."

 zaernmaera_events.4.t: "The Headless Statue"
 zaernmaera_events.4.desc: "Ebenanth, the First Emperor, remains a legendary figure in Taychend, an exemplar of the relic-lords who have dominated the region for so long. But to Chendhyans, he takes a particular place of hatred, as it was Ebenanth who first sought to subjugate the steppe, scouring the Chendhya with his relic, Starshear. Killing countless members of Munazhlan’s folk, he was nonetheless forced to turn back, his expedition a failure. But that has not healed the scars of his campaign – only a final gesture can place the legacy of the Chendhyans above those of the Taychendi.\n\nIn Orenkoraim, the titanic Gathyanavaida, a Precursor statue that towers over the Gates of the Kalavend, stands without a head, having been “decapitated” by a single powerful blast from Ebenanth’s relic. By rectifying that mistake, we can rectify the centuries of defeats inflicted on us by the Taychendi, and cement our dominance. First, however, we must choose which Chendhyan hero’s head should be built there.\n\nMunazhlan, our progenitor, who led us from slavery to the freedom of the steppe? Ultarlanbeg, the first Chendhyan to subjugate Taychend? Zaernsarlan II, who bought our current empire’s rise with the sweat of his brow and the blood of our enemies? Or perhaps the head of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetName], the elf who, some may say, could rival them all?"
 zaernmaera_events.4.a: "Munazhlan, the great father, shall return to Taychend!"
 zaernmaera_events.4.b: "Who could it be but Zaernsarlan?"
 zaernmaera_events.4.c: "Ultarlanbeg’s empire shall be avenged!."
 zaernmaera_events.4.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName], of course!"
