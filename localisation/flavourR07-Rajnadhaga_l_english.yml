 rajnadhaga_weaken_the_raj_title:0 "Weaken the Raj"
 rajnadhaga_weaken_the_raj_desc:0 "Our victory in Ghattub has shattered the hold of the Raj in the region.

 rajnadhaga_press_sarnihanpur_desc:0 "The Royal Library of Sarnihanpur was the first of the Royal libraries of the Nadimraj, and it still holds both the oldest and also the greatest number of books of any library in Rahen.

 rajnadhaga_resettling_valley_desc:0 "The reconquest of the North has seen the reinstallation of many former refugees and adventurers that profit from the instability of the area while clashing with bands of goblins, orcs and also local Shamakhadi.

 rajnadhaga_empower_merchant_class_desc:0 "The Merchants have always seen a smaller role in the Caste system instituted by the Harimraj.

 flavor_rajnadhaga.1.d:0 "Sarilavhan was the capital of the Raghajandi kingdom, one of the main powers of Shamakhad for centuries, and a beacon of civilisation. The hobgoblin Command settled there, reducing its population to slavery while their leaders roamed the palaces and manors defacing them with their lack of taste. After our victory in the latest war the city was freed and our soldiers entered it as liberators, freeing the masses of Khedarid people from their shackles. But our soldiers were not enough to canalize the fury of the crowds that pillaged their own cities, tracking the goblins that had stayed there, burning much of the city in the meantime. Now Sarilavhan is pacified and returned to Humans, but at a dire cost."

The Statist school mainly found among our administrators emphasis the role of the state, the only guarantee of peace and security. The River school, called this because of the book 'The Worldy Rivers', emphasis the role of the openness and exchange. Lastly we could sponsor the School of Courage that has glorified and justified the virtuous wars waged against the monstrous races."
