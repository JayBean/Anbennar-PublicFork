Drifting through seemingly endless beds of glowing jellyfish, they have little reason to believe that their children will experience anything different. As the shore slowly recedes from view, paper lanterns released for the prior night's Jellyfish Festival strike a prominent silhouette against the lightening heavens. And in that brief moment, the thoughts of the fishermen are united as they look upward toward the mirror of the sky and wonder what it'd be like to float amongst the lanterns.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nJaher and his Phoenix Legion's ill-fated conquest of §YYanshen§! was - as war often is - brutal, disruptive, and destructive. As Jaher's Legions advanced along the §YYanhe§!, many refugees dispersed south into the sparsely populated §YJellyfish Coast§!. There, they hoped that the Coast's rugged hills and hidden valleys would shelter them from the inevitable rising of Jaher's sun. It was these refugees and their descendants, coalescing after the chaos that was the ousting of the Phoenix, that formed the §YLeague of Feiten§!.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThough a relatively new entity in §YYanshen§!, §YFeiten§! has nevertheless managed to grow rich and catapult itself into relevance off the back of mercantile power. Efforts to convert this wealth into regional influence has been mixed, however. A recent war with the southern savages of §YZyujyut§! has netted §YFeiten§! the gateway to the tea jungle, §YCuihiok§!, but this conquest came at the steep cost of most of §YFeiten's§! fleet, stolen away by the pirate queen Ping Shuang of §YPinghoi§!. To the west, the efforts of §YFeiten§! and §YTianlou§! has led to the splintering of §YXiyun§!. Even now, those two countries fight to imprint their influence on the fledgling §YLuoyip§!. This conflict is only exacerbated by the fact that §YTianlou§!, the jewel of §YYanshen§!, has far and away the richest and most well-established merchant fleets this side of the Kharunyana. If §YFeiten§! wishes to leave its mark on the world, conflict with the city of temples and their entrenched eunuchs and traders is inevitable.\n\nThe city of §YFeiten§! itself lurches toward a flickering future. For centuries, the harbour had been the launching point for minor whaling expeditions by the natives of the area. Everyone knew that whale oil burned the longest and cleanest of any animal fat, and the small amount harvested with every whale hunt was perfect to use in the annual celebratory Jellyfish Festival to fill the skies with floating lanterns. But, why waste something with such interesting properties on mere toys? With §YFeiten§! looking for any advantage against its rivals, the true potential of whale oil has only just started to be realized..."

 feiten_port_facilities_title:0 "Rebuilding our Fleet"
 feiten_port_facilities_desc:0 "Ping Shuang's rebellion has left our once-proud fleet in shambles. Not only did the dread pirate queen make off with half our fleet, she even set much of the port district aflame as a parting gift! Out of the ashes, we must rebuild. The first step must be to restore Feiten's infrastructure and shipyards to use."
 feiten_dual_harbors_title:0 "Lungs of Commerce"
 feiten_dual_harbors_desc:0 "With Feiten started on the long road to recovery and Cuihiok pacified, now it is time to learn from the mistakes of the past and look to the future. First, we must ensure that the harbours are fully protected and secure. And once we are confident in their unassailability, we must build better facilities and marketplaces for our merchants."
 feiten_dual_harbors_effect_tt:0 "If both provinces fulfill the conditions, gain an additional §G3.00§! mercantilism"
 feiten_coast_blooms_title:0 "The Coast Blooms"
 feiten_coast_blooms_desc:0 "The lifeblood of Feiten may be the trade that our harbours and ports bring in, but we cannot neglect the rest of the League either. The many villages and towns sat within the hills and cliffsides of the Jellyfish Coast must be made to share in our prosperity, if only to keep their commitment to the League strong."
 feiten_integrate_cuihiok_title:0 "Gateway to the Jungle"
 feiten_integrate_cuihiok_desc:0 "The long war with Zyujyut may have left our fleet in shambles, but we were able to wrest the port of Cuihiok from the jungle savages, at the very least. Cuihiok sits at the river mouth that is the gateway into the tea jungle, and as such, full control over it is incredibly important for our trade ambitions in the area.\n\nThose dreams lie in the future, however, for now its populace is rebellious and our grasp tenuous - something that we must work to resolve."
 feiten_into_the_tea_forest_title:0 "Into the Jungle"
 feiten_into_the_tea_forest_desc:0 "Though we now own Cuihiok, Zyujyut still controls the jungles, and by extension, the land's tea production. Feiten's longstanding enmity with Zyujyut means that our traders and merchants face quite an unwelcoming environment when attempting to tap into the tea trade, a hostility that cannot be assuaged by even the largest sums of money that we can offer.\n\nThey leave us no choice: we must enter the jungle ourselves."
 feiten_monopoly_on_tea_gardens_title:0 "A Tea Monopoly"
 feiten_monopoly_on_tea_gardens_desc:0 "Victory over our old rivals! With the jungle under our control, our merchants and traders clamour for better access to and more production from the tea gardens that periodically break free from the tangle of the jungle. Let us oblige - a near monopoly over Zyujyut tea will make us all the richer."
 feiten_incite_the_rebellious_cub_title:0 "Incite the Rebellious Cub"
 feiten_incite_the_rebellious_cub_desc:0 "Our previous intrigues in Xiyun have borne fruit with the success of breakaway Luoyip and their uprising against their former overlords. For now, Luoyip are grateful for our assistance, and looking for friends as they consolidate.\n\nBoth us and Tianlou have extended our hand to them, eyeing the gem mines of Ongdou and favour in their capital, which is situated at the confluence of two rivers and the site of a High Temple, besides. What we can promise that Tianlou cannot as easily are the remaining lands of Xiyun, conveniently bordering our own lands. With this morsel in hand, we will entice the rebellious cub to our side."
 feiten_under_our_wing_title:0 "Under our Sails"
 feiten_under_our_wing_desc:0 "With Xiyun banished to the annals of history, it is finally time to call the many debts and favours that we hold over Luoyip and officially welcome them as our partners and bulwark to the west."
 feiten_under_our_wing_no_exist_tt:0 "As Luoyip either does not exist, are already our subject, or are not allied with us, mission rewards will be skipped."
 feiten_sate_silk_turban_greed_title:0 "A Gem Monopoly"
 feiten_sate_silk_turban_greed_desc:0 "Now that the tumult of war has calmed down, the question of how best to administer the land arises. As the only gem mines this side of the Yanhe, whomever controls Ongdou will have a near local monopoly on the industry and limitless potential to profit as they see fit. And as faithful embodiments of Silk Turban philosophy, this is a very appealing proposition indeed for our merchants."
 feiten_from_ongdou_tt:0 "from Ongdou"
 feiten_a_new_trading_power_title:0 "Hinterlands no Longer"
 feiten_a_new_trading_power_desc:0 "For most of Yanshen's history, it has been the Yanhe and its vast floodplains that have hosted the inception of great kingdoms and the seat of emperors. Tianlou, the city of towers, grew powerful and rich by virtue of its location at the mouth of the Yanhe and its nebulous link to the High Gods of old.\n\nBut what has been in the past does not guarantee the future. By our shrewd efforts and the cornering of several key markets, it is Feiten merchants that now dominate many cities, and Feiten merchant ships and balloons that become ever more common in the ports of South Haless and beyond. The Jellyfish Coast - formerly ridiculed as a backwater - prospers, and all can see that the future of Yanshen lies in the League of Feiten."
 feiten_white_gold_title:0 "White Gold"
 feiten_white_gold_desc:0 "Salt has long held the moniker of 'white gold' for its high value as a preservative and importance to the diet of any human. Doubly so for us, for the long voyages undertaken by our merchants, whether by balloon or ship, requires more salt than can conceivably be harvested from the sea. In Yanshen, it is the vast salt plains of Lake Kohai and its surrounding desert that provides most of this mineral - we must make plans to secure access to it, whether by force or by trade."
 feiten_white_gold_effect_tt_1:0 "§TIf completed by diplomacy:§!"
 feiten_white_gold_effect_tt_2:0 "§T\nIf completed by espionage:§!"
 feiten_control_the_salt_road_title:0 "Control the Salt Road"
 feiten_control_the_salt_road_desc:0 "One of the main arteries connecting the Jellyfish Coast with the rich cities and flood plains of the Yanhe is the salt road. Though a long and perilous journey through a desert, trade through this avenue bypasses the stranglehold that our rival Tianlou has on the mouth of the Yanhe. We must use our influence in the area to establish control and security for our merchants, and by extension all Feiten, to take advantage of and prosper through."
 feiten_monopoly_on_salt_title:0 "A Salt Monopoly"
 feiten_monopoly_on_salt_desc:0 "Ever more caravans from Feiten dominate the Salt Road, hastening our expansion into the greater markets of the Yanhe and beyond. By increasing production of 'white gold' and ensuring that we have a stranglehold on the market all the meanwhile, we can force all Yanshen to come to us for when they inevitably need this essential mineral."

 feiten_monopoly_on_salt_effect_tt_2:0 "from Sising"
 feiten_state_whaling_expeditions_title:0 "A Whaling Expedition"
 feiten_state_whaling_expeditions_desc:0 "For centuries, small scale whaling has been a supplemental trade for many fishing villages along the Jellyfish Coast. The blubber of certain whales have long been known as a cleaner burning and superior tallow to that of any other animal or fish, but rarely utilized due to its rarity and price. This high price makes it quite attractive as a trade good - maybe it is time to organize an expedition to feel out the potential of whaling?"
 feiten_first_foray_into_the_skies_title:0 "First Foray into the Skies"
 feiten_first_foray_into_the_skies_desc:0 "Feiten has long been known for its Jellyfish Festival. What makes the Jellyfish Festival different from the dozens of other celebrations for the New Years are the hundreds of paper lanterns that get released simultaneously to light up the skies as the year rolls over. These lanterns have traditionally been lit by whale oil, a luxury only Feiten is able to afford due to the rare whale hunt.\n\nWith the nascent emergence of an entire industry centered around whaling, the design and size of these lanterns have been growing more and more ornate as whale oil becomes more commonplace. Most citizens spare no further thought beyond competition with their neighbors and showing off their wealth, but some enterprising citizens begin to wonder at the true potential of these lanterns, especially coupled with just a bit of magic... Could sustained, controllable flight be possible with a bigger payload? Say, with a human?"
 feiten_from_theory_to_practice_title:0 "From Theory to Practice"
 feiten_from_theory_to_practice_desc:0 "Switch paper to canvas, made of the thinnest cloth, silk preferably. The simple whale fat candle, to an engineered cradle with flame control. Finally, add a bamboo basket underneath - and the paper lantern has been transformed into what we have affectionately dubbed a Shuimu, or a Jellyfish Balloon, for how the flame luminesces as it refracts through the sheer envelope.\n\nA simple set of steps, perhaps, but going from the first prototype to this has been a long and difficult process. For now, the technology is young, barely able to carry the weight of a single adolescent, but what limitless potential! Untethered by the tug of gravity and floating through the vast oceans of the sky, the Shuimu Balloons are a fascination to all of Feiten, and rightly so. Some advisors have even started to come forth with the idea of using them to scout, a natural use of the visibility and range advantage of these balloons."
 feiten_haichapha_title:0 "Support our Diokzatgun"
 feiten_haichapha_desc:0 "Our merchants and trade ships are going further afield and carrying larger cargoes than ever before, which brings the problem of a corresponding uptick in piracy and corsairs looking to follow in the wake of the now-legendary Ping Shuang. Our Diokzatgun, specialized pirate hunters, do much to combat these constant threats, but as they only recruit from a limited pool of vetted Feiten citizens, their resources are spread too thin. Invest some of our profits back into supporting our Diokzatgun with better ships, more advanced armaments, and coastal defenses, and we can pound the pirates into submission."
 feiten_staging_grounds_title:0 "Staging Grounds"
 feiten_staging_grounds_desc:0 "Explorations to the north and south, probing around the storm, have revealed many new islands. Many, if not most, of these are rocky, wind-blasted hellscapes at risk of being drowned at any second, but there are some that seem hold promise as forward whaling bases or as resupplying bases for our ships. If we can build up infrastructure and develop these islands up, we can make great use of them yet."
 feiten_gateways_title:0 "Gateway to the World"
 feiten_gateways_desc:0 "More than ever, the fortunes of Feiten are carried on ocean waves and skyward currents. Whether serving on whaling boats bound for distant shores, or serving on balloons and carried by the vagrancies of the wind, all funnel through Feiten itself or our southern harbour of Cuihiok. Our facilities in these cities are starting to be strained past their breaking point - we must ensure that they do not fail as we continue to discover new lands for our people to our east."
 feiten_determine_settler_policy_title:0 "Settler Policy"
 feiten_determine_settler_policy_desc:0 "With new lands being discovered almost everyday, we must decide on a direction for how we handle their incorporation." 
 feiten_of_guano_and_whale_oil_title:0 "Of Bird Guano and Whale Oil"
 feiten_of_guano_and_whale_oil_desc:0 "The primary thing we look for when exploring the ocean-past-the-storm are islands that can work as whaling stations - islands with a sheltered bay, wood for repairs, and ample freshwater and animals for meat. Failing those, the islands almost always teem with seabirds, who cover the rocks with many feet of their droppings.\n\nMany of the older farmers amongst the Jellyfish Coast know well the value of bird and bat droppings as fertilizer, having taken advantage of seabird nesting sites amongst the pocked cliffs and caves of the Coast since the days of their forefathers. The nearby deposits have been running low as our people coax life out of the Jellyfish Coast's poor soil, but every new island layered with guano is another boon for us."
 feiten_of_guano_and_whale_oil_effect_tt:0 "All single province island colonies will get +1 production upon finishing and +25 local settler growth while in progress."
 feiten_aelantir_ambitions_title:0 "Aelantiri Markets"
 feiten_aelantir_ambitions_desc:0 "Far past the eternal storm and guano islands lies a vast, new frontier: Aelantir. But we are far from the first to discover this new land. Local "Ruinborn" form pockets of civilization across much of the new continents, while the Cannorians have already staked their claim to much of the remaining land, having approached from other side of Aelantir well before we did.\n\nBoth groups require trade, of course, for trade is the lifeblood of civilization, and our balloons are positioned to take full advantage of this."
 feiten_secrets_of_the_precursors_title:0 "Secrets of the Precursors"
 feiten_secrets_of_the_precursors_desc:0 "Hidden deep within overgrown jungle, crushed under the weight of centuries of continual construction and destruction, half submerged under the ocean and battered by the tides - Aelantir is a wealth of Precursor ruins and artifacts. Ever since the density of these relics in Aelantir was discovered, the Shuimu Engineering Cadre have been at the forefront of pushing us to take advantage of them for whatever research and development they cook up in their facilities. If Precursor Relics can truly push our inventions and technology as far as the Cadre claims, we would be fools not to invest as much as we can into their extraction."
 feiten_secrets_of_the_precursors_effect_tt:0 "We will unlock a new, costlier, research privilege, which will accelerate the invention reserach process."
 feiten_the_foreign_quarter_title:0 "The Foreign Quarter"
 feiten_the_foreign_quarter_desc:0 "More and more Cannorians sail their way eastward in search of the exotic riches of Haless, many of them looking to establish permanent bases and trading posts. Through establishing special trading zones and privileged areas for them in our cities, we can make sure that their products flow through us first, instead of our rivals. Cuihiok would be the perfect city for one of these locations, at the heart of the coveted tea trade - we must do all we can to support the fledgling community of Cannorians there."

 feiten_the_foreign_quarter_effect_tt_2:0 "If the §yReformists§! are in power:" 
 feiten_advent_of_unraveling_title:0 "Advent of Unraveling"
 feiten_advent_of_unraveling_desc:0 "The influx of Cannorians in our cities has come with an unintended side effect - the slow spread of Cannorian philosophies and religions into our own populace. The gnomes of the Gommo had little interest in doing so, preoccupied as they were with science and scholarship alone, but many of the Cannorians are of the proselytizing Corinite or Ravelian type. Ravelianism in particular has taken hold in many former followers of High Philosophy. The Ravelian focus on gaining knowledge and figuring out the mysteries of the world also resonates with many of our Cadre members as well.\n\nMany of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors and friends who have converted are imploring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to at least hear out one of the missionaries when they come on a visit. Perhaps they have a point?"
 feiten_unity_of_thought_title:0 "Unity"
 feiten_unity_of_thought_desc:0 "The fires of religious conflict have racked our nation for far too long, pitting fathers against their own sons and seeding hatred amongst our peoples. We will undoubtedly emerge stronger as a nation, but first, these wounds must be mended and our people unified."
 feiten_chasing_whale_migrations_title:0 "New Whaling Grounds"
 feiten_chasing_whale_migrations_desc:0 "Every year, as the spring thaw turns hill snow into rivulets of sparkling crystal, the citizens of Feiten wave goodbye to their husbands and sons, watching them sail into the horizon atop the wooden beasts that are their whaling boats. Everyone in Feiten knows that the start of spring is the best time for whaling, for that is when the whales migrate from their winter seas back up north to their summer feeding seas. Usually, within a cycle or two of the moon, most of the whalers would have come back with their holds full of catch.\n\nIn recent years, the whalers have been returning later and later, and oftentimes with hold half empty. Clearly, the old hunting grounds have been tapped out. We cannot let the whaling industry falter - we must find new fisheries, and quick!"
 feiten_mapping_storm_boundaries_title:0 "Storm Boundaries"
 feiten_mapping_storm_boundaries_desc:0 "For as long as our fishermen and sailors can remember, there has been a massive storm to our east. The storm consumes all, stretching its claws beneath the churning sea foam and rising up to swallow the very stars themselves. Local tales say that the storm will one day tire of its feast and start westward to flood the world in its entirety.\n\nTales of a more... suspicious age, of course - we know better, for every philosopher and wise-man knows that the world is round, and so the storm must peter out at some location. We do not know what lies beyond or within, but as our merchants seek new trade routes and access to more products and whaling bases, it will be important to map out the edges of storm in its entirety."
 feiten_to_build_an_airfleet_title:0 "To Build an Airfleet"
 feiten_to_build_an_airfleet_desc:0 "Just like a oceangoing ship, a balloon requires three major things: wood, canvas cloth, and armaments. The specifications to which these three things are needed are much different, however, as each piece must be as light as possible while remaining reliable in the winds. This will required specialized manufactories, workshops, and associated facilities to accomplish."

 feiten_league_in_schism_title:0 "The League in Schism"
 feiten_league_in_schism_desc:0 "Not all are happy with the course that Feiten has decided to chart in the wake of our self-proclaimed Age of Silk. The Silken Council is split in half. Many of the more established members see the encroachment of foreign influence as unacceptable and at risk of ruining all the wealth they have carefully accumulated over the years, while others see opportunity in that very same thing.\n\nThe League is split, and we must be careful to make sure that the cracks don't grow too large to be managed."
 feiten_league_in_schism_effect_tt:0 "\nThe starting power of the groups will depend on previous choices in events.\n\nWhile in power, the §YOld Guard§! will give:\nTrade Power Abroad: §v+20.0%§!\nTechnology Cost: §R+20.0%§!\nLand Fire Damage: §v+10.0%§!\n\nWhile in power, the §YReformists§! will give:\nNational Unrest: §v-1.00§!\nTechnology Cost: §v-10.0%§!\nDiscipline: §R-5.0%§!\nGoods Produced Modifier: §v+10.0%§!\nAll Estates Loyalty Equilibrium: §R-10.0%§!"
 feiten_dredging_feiten_bay_title:0 "Dredging Feiten Bay"
 feiten_dredging_feiten_bay_desc:0 "With ever deeper hulls leaving the shipyards of the world, deep-water ports are more important than ever in this age of global trade. Feiten Bay has served us adequately for many years, but an expansion is overdue. Silt continues to build up at the mouth of river, preventing ingress to the sheltered coves where our balloons and airships dock safe from constant ocean salt and wind. A concerted dredging effort will benefit the city immensely."
 feiten_lighter_than_air_title:0 "Lighter than Air"
 feiten_lighter_than_air_desc:0 "Our balloons require the burning of prodigious amounts of whale oil to fill their envelopes with rising hot air. As more and more of our Shuimu crowd the skies and demand increases, our stores of whale oil are fast running out, the dwindling hunting grounds fast depleting.\n\nThis is a problem that our Shuimu Engineering Cadre have been bashing their heads against the wall for a while, but it is only now that the candle of this problem is burning low. We must sponsor new research with all haste."

 feiten_feiten_school_ascendant_title:0 "Eastern Schools of Thought"
 feiten_feiten_school_ascendant_desc:0 "The High Rectorate is split between two main factions, for the most part - the zealots, and the erudites. Their debates take place far from us, in Cannor, but the reverberations of their decisions echo in Haless as well, even if less strongly than in the center of the faith.\n\nMany of their debates center around how to interpret the God Fragment's ramblings. We have extensive experience interpreting cryptic missives from higher powers, as all High Philosophy has had for guidance over these centuries were whatever writings survived in the High Temples. We should push for permanent delegation of our own to the Rectorate, so that we can give our own interpretations and scholarship and take part in these debates."
 feiten_masters_of_the_seas_title:0 "Masters of the Seas"
 feiten_masters_of_the_seas_desc:0 "If we wish to truly take the crown of preeminent trading power in Yanshen, we must have a fleet with the ability to protect our interests, and then some.

 feiten_bombs_over_tianlou_desc:0 "With our dominance in the seas assured, Tianlou has no hope of resupply or relief should we aim to break the city with a siege. Even still, Tianlou stands as the biggest city in all Yanshen, with years worth of supplies safely hidden in the dozens of High Temple complexes that dominate the skyline. Bloody urban warfare is the only way to conquer Tianlou, or so is traditionally thought.\n\nBut we have something that no other would-be conqueror has - balloons that can soar above even the tallest of Tianlou's temples, out of range of any cannon. And though we have not tested them against a live enemy yet, the Shuimu Engineering Cadre have come up with lightweight bombs that can be used to devastating effect if dropped from our balloons..."

Inadvertent as that result may have been, it doesn't change that the rest of Yanshen now looks at us with fear in their eyes, wondering if our bombs will fall on their cities next. Shall we assuage them of that fear, or lean into our newfound respect?\n\nOnce we have resolved the our relationship with the rest of Yanshen, we must finally turn our attention outward.

Our Shuimu pilots very quickly figured out how useful these devices are atop a balloon, but with no domestic production at all, have had to resort to buying from Cannorian merchants at exorbitant prices.\n\nIf we can establish a glassworks on our own shores, we can wean off our dependence on Cannorian glass and begin to design our own inventions and innovations with the material."

With their slight build and penchant for yearning for flight, the Goldscales have proven to be reliable airshipmen by the earlier adopters of balloons among our merchants, even if they were originally only brought along primarily as good luck charms.

Though still respected and a required reading for any general, it is treated as more of a philosophical rather than practical work today.\n\nOur expertise as the originators of balloon and airship warfare means that we have accumulated much knowledge over the years, enough to pen an "Art of War" for the modern age that will be circulated and read as widely as the original: The Aeronaut's Handbook."

In its raw form, the powder is extremely volatile and dangerous - to ramp up production and fully take advantage of this new discovery, we must build up facilities suited to handle and produce nitroglycerin safely."

Central to this web is the "cloud corridor", a loop that starts and ends in Feiten. Our balloons take off laden with goods from across Yanshen, following the Yanhe until we reach the Xianjie and Kharunyana river. After making a tidy profit buying and selling spices, they make north for the Serpentspine, before flying directly across it to the Lake Federation. This way, the vast steppes full of facestealers and uncooperative southward currents of northern Haless can be avoided. After trading with the Lake Federation, it is a relatively short trip taking those southward currents back down to Feiten again."

 flavor_feiten.1.title:0 "Whaling Expedition: Setting Off"
 flavor_feiten.1.desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] looks over the rickety fishing boat, despair writ plain across his face. From [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] vantage point atop the pier, the boat appears entirely too in danger of capsizing as it rolled with with the minor tides close to shore to handle a few tuna, much less the ship sized whales that were to be their quarry. Noticing [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s trepidation, the captain of the ship limps over, a slight grin on his face.\n\n    "She may not look like much, but she's served me well in over a dozen hunts. And I wager she'll serve for a dozen more."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is in the process of turning to give a grateful nod as the ocean finally wins the tug of war, a rogue wave washing over the boat's deck to a chorus of loud curses from those on deck. The nod curdles to a shudder and the captain's grin, of course, only grows wider as [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s face turns pale."

 flavor_feiten.2.title:0 "Whaling Expedition: Bored at Sea"
 flavor_feiten.2.desc:0 "Being at sea was, fundamentally, boring. Oh, there were always tasks to be done, from patching holes in the sails, to scraping and cleaning accumulated salt and dirt. Even these tasks were denied to [Root.Monarch.GetName] on account of his status as a guest, however, and so the days following a too-long period of seasickness were filled with monotony as the whaling vessel sailed through open ocean.\n\nEver the entrepreneur, [Root.Monarch.GetName] figured that this could be a good chance to talk with some of the crew of the ship, learn something about their lifestyles and whaling itself, and incorporate that into future endeavors."

 flavor_feiten.3.title:0 "Whaling Expedition: Whale Sighted!"
 flavor_feiten.3.desc:0 "Frantic cries of "Whale Sighted!" carry through the ship suddenly, followed by the heavy stomp of boots on wood. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is jolted out of their sleep and rushes deck side, where the harpooners and rowers are already preparing to launch. No one pays [Root.Monarch.GetName] any mind, fixated as they are on the flickering crescent of the whale's tale and blast of its blowhole as it swims just underneath the surface of the ocean ahead.\n\nThe air is heavy with pent up energy and the potential of action - so much so that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is compelled to do something, anything, despite lacking the years of experience that these sailors have."

 flavor_feiten.4.satBack:0 "The small harpoon boats launch one by one, each accompanied by great splashes and violent rocking as the whaling boat jettisons the weight of each smaller vessel. They skim like tiny water striders toward the beast, coordinating as to not startle the whale. After catching up to the whale and matching its speed, the harpooners ready for a signal. And upon getting it, their missiles arc high like shooting stars, glinting in the sunlight; most miss, falling short, but one embeds itself in the right flank of the whale, and the chase is on!\n\nThe whale darts left, then right, trying desperately to dislodge the harpoon in its flank, a crimson cloud billowing out from the wound. Unsuccessful, it dives, and the harpoon rope starts to whip and unwind from the boat. Just as it looks like the rope will snap taut, it stops unwinding as the whale runs out of breath and starts streaking toward the surface again. The other harpoon boats take full advantage as it surfaces and lance the whale, aiming to pierce any of its vital organs. Weakened so, the whale's movements slow, until it ceases entirely. Ragged cheers rise up among the crew - finally, the culmination of months of tracking, and a guarantee of payout once back at port.\n\nNow, the crew set to the exhausting task of butchering the whale, before sharks and scavengers can set upon the carcass. Afterwards, it was back to Feiten."
 flavor_feiten.4.descInjured:0 "With a great splash, the harpoon boat drops into the ocean. With oars slicked and face blinded by ocean spray, it took all of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s effort just to cling on and follow the fragile craft's captain's orders. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s world narrowed to a single action: that of pulling and resetting and pulling and resetting the oar. An eternity later, the call to slow down was finally yelled, a sign that the harpoon boats were close to the whale. All eyes were focused on the harpooners now, who stood ready with weapons in hand.\n\n         "Fire!"\n\nAnd suddenly, their missiles arc high like shooting stars, glinting in the sunlight. For a split second, it seems that all will miss, but one embeds itself in the right flank of the whale. The oarsmen, including [Root.Monarch.GetName], explode into action, frantically pumping their oars to get away as fast as possible, lest the whale's thrashing score a direct hit on the fragile craft. The whale darts left, then right, trying desperately to dislodge the harpoon in its flank, a crimson cloud billowing out from the wound. Unsuccessful, it dives, and the harpoon rope starts to whip and unwind from the boat. Abruptly, the rope snaps taut, having gotten tangled on a piece of wood. The harpoon boat starts to get dragged to and fro, at risk of capsizing unless something is done. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] is closest, they...\n\n§rPut all their might into dislodging the rope. With a final burst of adrenaline, the rope breaks free, whipping [Root.Monarch.GetName] square in the chest and knocking [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] on their back in a tangled heap. [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets injured!§!\n\nWith the rope free, the boat settles. Eventually, the rope stops unwinding as the whale runs out of breath and starts streaking toward the surface again.

 flavor_feiten.40.desc:0 "In the past, whaling has been an individual endeavor. To cover as much ocean surface as possible, ships spread out, scanning widely for the elusive whale. As whaling has exploded in Feiten, so too have our techniques and hunts.\n\nInstead of a singular ship sailing out into open ocean, a spotter fleet now patrols the Jellyfish Coast. Once a suitable beast is found, the fleet works together to drive the whale into shallower waters and tire it out, where specialized, smaller harpoon boats quickly pounce. The days of famous captains making their fortune off of a single successful hunt may be over, but the group hunting method is much more consistent and reliable overall."

 flavor_feiten.41.title:0 "Whaling: Collapse of the Coastal Fisheries"
 flavor_feiten.41.desc:0 "The world's insatiable need for more whales has been a great boon to our economy, but this hunger has led to a boom in would-be hunters and fortune seekers who strip the old hunting grounds down to the bone. The discovery of greater fisheries out in open ocean has alleviated this somewhat, saving our industry, but the coastal fisheries along the Yanshen Coast have now been completely tapped out.\n\nOur advisors suggest implementing a hunting license system to give the whales time to recover.

Steam powered boats, self-propelled harpoons, factory machines for processing: these and a million other small inventions and improvements have turned the whaling industry on its head.\n\nNow, our whalers don't need the services of an expensive mage on board to hunt the biggest whales, or to labouriously butcher by hand, or spend months sailing to the hunting grounds before returning empty-handed due to a failed harpoon stick.

More recently, we have learned to hunt trade and commerce, which require a careful studying of price and demand before loading the optimal cargo. But we have never had to outfit an expedition like this one.\n\nBecause today we are sending an expedition to Cannor, to make our name on the world stage. We will not bring back carcass or coin, but scholar, philosopher, and artisan, seeking their finest minds to bring our airships to a new zenith.\n\nThe aims are lofty, bit the business at hand more practical. Aside from the provision and fuel necessary for this epic voyage, there is a small store-room earmarked for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s discretion.

But for all our lofty heights let us look down on the continent unfurling below, we were still awestruck when we approached Anbenncóst. Feiten has ballooned in recent years, but even now it is but a pale rival to the city of the world's desire. Anbenncóst is massive, and seemingly every inch filled with buildings and people -- from above, the chaos of The Bilge is nonapparent, and the haphazard arrangement of Elvendocks belies its wealth and nobility.\n\nBy pre-arranged approval, we docked at one of the tallest spires in the Temple District, sole property of the Order of Chroniclers. We had not even begun to tie ropes to their hastily-assembled skydock when we were faced with a veritable platoon of guildsmen -- peppering us with questions, sketching the Shuimu Engineering Cadre's creations, and, well, chronicling our visit.\n\nIn due time, however, the eager scholars were herded away, and we were greeted by the Guild's leader. There will be a welcome feast, it seems, a chance to meet the Guild's best and brightest. And so now we must determine our approach.\n\nWe could look for a specific sort of scholar whose expertise we could use in Feiten, and concentrate on impressing them to the point they will surely join us on our return. A theologian, fascinated to debate and discuss High Philosophy? A scientist to help us break new ground in our research? Or perhaps a philosopher, well-equipped to contribute and inform novel developments?\n\nWe have not aimed low with this voyage, however, and this is no time to start. Why settle for a single guild representative, when we deserve a multitude? If we impress the guild master sufficiently, she will undoubtedly see that Feiten merits a guild chapter of its own, to record for posterity the greatness we are building."

The land was dotted with orchards, with green rolling hills filling the space between them. It is easy to see why they call this the Winebay, and it is hard to imagine just how many thousands of bottles-worth of grapes we saw growing beneath us.\n\nThe pattern continued almost all the way to Lorentainé proper, though it's tall elven spires made it an icon on the horizon for days. They had cleared a small field outside the city walls for us to land in, from what apparently was once a vineyard, now made fallow by a grape-killing fungus. Leaving a small guard with the skyships, we proceeded into the city, to present ourselves at the court of [67.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [67.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\nThere is to be a ball tonight, serving the best of the region's wines, at which our delegation will be guests of honor.

(The same cannot be true for Esmarian river parties, we spotted a smoke-plume over Seinathil from what must have been revelry gone awry).\n\nOur voyage's final visit was to Giberd, the sole gnomish country in the Empire of Anbennar, and a major hub for Cannorian artificery. It houses the Gommo's Imperial Branch, and while the world-spanning gnomish artificers guild may not match our Shuimu engineers' mastery of sky-ships, they more than make up for it with their expertise in so many other areas.\n\nThey are our only destination with a proper skydock, and the smooth landing is quickly followed by a torrent of inquiry from the gnomes. What's behind our choice of wood? Does porcelain open up long-term damestear storage? How did we solve the propellant-mass problem? It is like flying through a storm, except instead of being pelted by rain, each droplet is a small figure quickly asking detailed and specific questions.\n\nThe gnomes are clearly fascinated by us (or the Shiumu work that brought us, at least), and any member of the Gommo will cross the world in pursuit of answers -- and would undoubtedly come to Feiten. We have our pick of experts: engineers a plenty, as well as some gnomes with ideas on how to use artificery, not just develop it.

It has not been that long, truly. But already, the city looks different, and they dock at an air-spire that was simply not there when the voyage left. The Shuimu engineering apprentices taking on ships' lines have unfamiliar faces, and nearby sky vessels are clearly built with some updated design.\n\nBut as he waits for the Cannorian passengers to disembark, the captain is proud. Feiten has flown around the world, and brought back some of Cannor's jewels. More will come -- more voyages, more visitors, more glory. But for now, there is a small home for him to return to, a garden to visit, and a tree to pace around.

The bombs were meant for strategic targets only: arms depots, garrisons, the docked ships and warehouses of our rival merchants, and destroy these targets they did. But even then we're not quite sure how it turned into this level of devastation -- perhaps a Tamphora merchant selling crystallized magic whose wares caught ablaze?

Their innards were filled with smoke, their red exterior is charred, and in some places the heat was so intense it warped and melted the very earth the temples are built on. They may some day recover, but for now, it is as if we had taken a most precious painting and set it ablaze.\n\nAnd that is what, roughly, philosophers of every school are claiming we did. In poem, treatise, oratory, formal letter, and more, schools often at odds are joined together in condemning our recent acts. They demand immediate reparations, saying that it will take immense effort just to get the temples to a state they can begin repairs.

And today, on the steps of Feiten's grand workshop, he lit himself on fire.\n\nA note we found in his room explains why: the shame of seeing engineering used for devastation, the horror that the Shuimu Engineering Cadre would abet such crimes, the resolve that this death by fire was truly but one compared to the thousands upon thousands who died like this in Tianlou.\n\nIn the aftermath, it seems many who work on the Shuimu agree with Zhangang, and are refusing to work on airships if they are to be used for such violence."

Our actions in Tianlou were undoubtedly enough to earn fear and loathing from many of Yanshen's powers, and undoubtedly they would see us as an enemy -- if there was not already a terrifying, unstoppable, power breathing down our necks, which already has a monopoly on all the eunuchs' nightmares: The Command.\n\nAnd so the first delegations we received from our neighbours were not condemnations, not quite. They lambasted us for the devastation we had wrought... but all then turned to discussions of whether such a maneuver would be feasible against heavy arrow-fire, and how effective it might be at shattering even the most disciplined of formations.\n\nIf Yanshen is to have a foe, it shall not be us. Instead, with the airships providing hope against an otherwise dominant military, let us organize a coalition to confront the hobgoblin scourge and end it. It may take some effort to convince people that the ashes in one city matter little when compared to the miles of ashes left behind by the Command's occupying force, but it is what we need. And what we shall do."

There is too much in the way of parochial squabbles, too much fear of being the first to fall, and ultimately, too much dread that even the largest coalition would lose. But out of the Tianlou firestorm, it seems that last factor melted away, and the rest could be overcome. Suddenly, we could go against Haless's most deadly army with a trick up our sleeves -- or in the skies, as it were.\n\nThat opportunity was enough to build this coalition. But now we must put it to the test, and send our balloons against the enemy. We could concentrate them with our own forces, but that would risk our nominal allies succumbing again to fear. Alternatively, we could lend their armies brigades of scouting balloons, or even our own war balloons, so that every force that marches against the Command has a reason to believe they will win. (Of course, the technology and plans will not be shared in any way, shape, or form).\n\nThe map is laid out before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the battle orders drafted, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will..."

But even though none can rival the Shuimu cadre's adeptness at balloon engineering, our generals are still adjusting their way of thinking to this new dimension of combat. The war-planning session today made that clear -- but also just how much it makes possible.\n\nIt started as an off-hand wish: "If only we could remove their threat without defeating each and every army against us." It became a possibility when our head Shuimu engineer spoke up: "You know, it would almost be easier to load a balloon with supplies and a small complement of munitions, and drop them somewhere deep inside the enemy, than constantly outfit massive fleets to win individual battles..." And then, after some quick calculations -- followed by many hours working through the logistical pieces -- it became a genuine plan.\n\nThe Command's Grand Marshals have brought war to Haless. So we will bring war to them -- directly to them. Spies report that our foe's beating heart is their great warcamp in Sarilavhan, a military base that is almost as dense as Tianlou. If we destroyed it, we would undoubtedly strike a blow deeper than any single defeat on the battlefield could achieve.

But it was a chance to move past recriminations over Tianlou, and towards addressing Yanshen's greatest threat. We hoped against hope that fighting together, with support in the skies, we could at least stop such an implacable foe, if not force them back.\n\nBut it worked. It worked! Some of our airships were just recently constructed, but they still brought down countless hobgoblins. Coordination between forces was shaky at best, but we fought together when it counted. Our lines sometimes bent, but they never broke.\n\nNot too long ago, diplomats came to Feiten to excoriate the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] over what our airships unleashed. But today, as our victory is celebrated across all Yanshen, every foreign diplomat in Feiten is getting drunk on rice wine with delight, and many are toasting the very ships they once condemned. It is a party that [Root.Monarch.GetName] will join soon enough, but first there is a decision to be made.\n\nTomorrow, all those diplomats will wake up (many with a hangover). And they will wake to a land, though victorious, has still been ravaged by war. Battlefields dot once-fertile land like scars, farmers and artisans have died fighting as soldiers, and even fields untouched by direct conflict were trampled under tens of thousands of boots. We have been Yanshen's savior in war. Will we be its savior in peace, as well?\n\nWe could direct resources across the land, even using skyships to transport goods where rebuilding is most required. We would undoubtedly ingratiate ourselves to our neighbours (and we could probably leverage that into some trade benefits, too). But we have flown so long over lands not our own -- there are so many graves to dig and people to mourn, not to mention the new designs our Shuimu are already drafting.

The discovery of untamed lands to our east only exacerbates our needs for more labour, if we are to take full and quick advantage of the resources that the new lands represent. Diverting our stream of impressed sailors toward settling this land may help us tame the land quicker, at the expense of our sailor pool.

But come now, see the world, through a Feiten jellyfish's eyes.\n\nThe flight over Yanshen is the most familiar, but often the most chaotic -- constant messenger hawks exchange letters between skyships and skyposts, and the risk of a mid-air collision is real. The Xianjie's mists preclude any interesting observations, and it is not until Rahen that one can truly admire the vista below, picking out the most impressive High Temple complexes.\n\nThe Marutha's warm updrafts will propel you over the Paravimvhata range, and soon you will fly high above Ebbušubtu (and do note, with a smile, that even a place this holy could not deny the utility of having a small skyport nearby). When you arrive in Bulwar and are swarmed by merchants' flying carpets offering wares from a thousand bazaars, conceal any disdain at their inferior craft -- there is no need to be impolite.\n\nThe Divenhal is beautiful, the sunlight warm and a sparkling blue blanket below, but do not lose your edge. You will need all your wits about you when you dock in Anbenncóst, and trade for the Dragon Coast's newest gadgets and Konwell's most erudite publications. If you take aboard a black-robed Rector, well, consider it an honour (one that should instantly sober you up).\n\nThen it is west, ever west. You will cross to Aelantir in a matter of weeks (much improved from the elves' millennium), and if you look closely, you can see the Ruinrim's outline in the ocean's patterns. Each skyport here is different, from the Triarchy's newfangled designs to the bizarre array in Kheionai (no Kheion would go without!). But most importantly, do little but concrete business at the Eordan skyport; the various faiths may be united in their appreciation of Feiten's commerce, but wage brutal political war to determine who has access and control. Make no promises, no allies, and no enemies.\n\nDo you grow weary? Good, riding the Great Storm's outskirts should shake you awake as it speeds you on your way. And then, when you see balloons in the distance, where balloons have floated for centuries, but now fly and soar to heights once unimaginable -- then, you will know you are home."

Both took place aboard an airship, both took place at roughly the same time, and both, he thinks, illuminate just what the League of Feiten has become.\n\nThe birth happened aboard a small merchant airship that plied local trade along the Cloud Corridor. It was unplanned but uneventful -- the pregnant mother, who had flown ships in Bulwar and Aelantir long before her marriage, "would be damned if a quick jaunt in friendly skies was too force a wind to ride." It was probably not the first child  born aloft, given the lengthy journeys to Cannor, but the child was still presented to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] when the ship landed in Feiten, a glint of sunshine amidst the grey morass that is paperwork.\n\nThe death [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not hear of directly, no, it as a piece of gossip overheard as two messengers departed his chambers. Old Man Lee, they called him, a man who had hunted whales in a time long past, and even as the ship he worked on was refurbished and retrofitted into a merchant vessel, no one would refuse him when he went aboard for each departure with harpoon in hand, ready for the hunt that never came. In the interim, he would tell stories to the crew (often decades his younger), lose a little coin in minor gambling (though by journey's end it was always returned as his 'wages'), and nap in a stern-side hammock. It was doing the last one that he passed; the crew were amazed at how he slept through a small gust-storm, until they tried and failed to wake him. It is not the first death in the air -- the Shuimu Engineering Cadre keeps detailed records of every soul lost to mechanical defect or mishap, and war is brutally unsparing no matter how far above a battlefield one floats.\n\nIs this his people, now? Who are born in the skies, who ply the winds all their life, until there they die?\n\nNot quite. Now he has drifted a few dozen leagues south of Feiten proper, and floats above the towns and villages that yet dot the Jellyfish Coast. In the steam-powered workshops below, countless weave cloth or forge metal or carve wood, devoting a lifetime's labour to filling the Shuimu workshops but never partaking of the engineers' craft.\n\nTheir lives are shaped by it all the same, though, not just their work. The bottle of Lencori wine they sip from at night, the latest tract from the Rectorate they study after shifts, the steam-powered mechanisms that ease a life in countless ways.\n\nDoes this make his people a people of the skies? No. Ownership is the other way around. From the youngest child to the oldest citizen: the sky belongs to them. Every inch, every breeze, every horizon yet to come.

If this diverse group of Gommo representatives, religious leaders, Yangcheng alchemists, and Shuimu engineers could not crack the problem, then it was never solvable to begin with. There was one final question before the kickoff could commence in earnest: who would lead this initiative? Too many cooks spoil the broth, afterall, and it was vital that there was clear leadership and direction. Surveying the expectant crowd, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sees several possible options.\n\nThe first option would be to hand over leadership to [Root.GetName]'s own Shuimu Engineering Cadre. It is the Cadre's own problem, in the end, and they are very familiar with the unique constraints of our Shuimu.\n\nYangcheng College's Xuézhe of the Chemics are well versed in alchemy and chemistry, having devoted their entire lives to research and discovery of the basic elements of our material plane.[Root.getLighterThanAirDescGnomishAllies][Root.getLighterThanAirDescRavelian]"

[Root.Monarch.GetName] was, of course, not visiting to reprimand the scientists on shoddy safety practices, though perhaps every hiss of gas and clink of alchemical flask elicited a greater wince than it would have otherwise. No, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was here to survey the path forward, for the research at Yangcheng College has finally borne fruit.\n\nOil of vitriol, a substance known for centuries by alchemists for its acidic properties and harsh nature, once poured on scrap iron, will produce a brilliant blue dye. Done in a closed vessel, a gas violently flares out - one that can fill a silken canvas bag and make it float into the skies.[Root.getLighterThanAirDescElectrolysisMages][Root.getLighterThanAirDescCoal]\n\nIt will likely take more years still to fully realize the path forward, but at least now, the light at the end of the tunnel can be seen."

To hasten the development of this source of fuel for our balloons and airships, our Shuimu Engineering Cadre have put forth three different areas in which we can benefit from sending a research team to learn from.\n\nThe first is the dwarovrod, the ancient rail tracks of the fallen dwarven empire. In recent years, the dwarven reclaimers of their homeland have not only restored many of their old rails, but improved upon them for the modern era. Many of their trains are supplemented with coal powered steam pumps to clear out old mines and flooded passages alike.\n\nSecond, the naval dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr have developed a new class of naval ships that they have named "ironclads". Massive and built of heavy metal, these low-sitting ships take full advantage of coal-fired engines to drive them, in lieu of wind and sail. They may have the most relevant knowledge for our purposes.\n\nFinally, we have heard rumours of a city in Cannor where the river and skies run black with industry - Alenath. Though not directly related to our goal, the magnates of the Alen are the most experienced in the world with coal and steam technology.

So much pent up energy and potential within storm clouds, and only the barest amount ever makes it to the ground as lightning. Would it be possible to fly our balloons above the storms and safely collect the energy in magical batteries, to be used for other purposes later? As it turns out, yes."

 flavor_feiten.300.desc:0 "Our earliest expeditions to Aelantir unearthed wonders aplenty: the strange and foreign Ruinborn, massive ruined complexes akin to the High Temples of our home, and magical storms and energies that rent our explorers asunder. It is the mundane among all that has been brought from Aelantir, however, that concerns [Root.Monarch.GetName] today.\n\nDozens of profitable new crops discovered in the tropical climes of Aelantir, among them new varietals of sugarcane, sweet potatoes, and cocoa. Many of the more enterprising of our merchants wish to trial cultivation of these crops in [Root.GetName], to cut out the need for a lengthy ocean voyage. Growing these would of course come at the expense of other crops. Conflict grows between two factions of the League of Feiten - the communities who depend on traditional tea plantations for their livelihood and trade, and the city merchants who see profit and potential in these new world crops."

Indeed, gnomes are now a common sight in certain districts in many our ports, from Feiten to Cuihiok. Not all are happy with their presence in [Root.GetName], however. Many warn of the hidden price of our progress - the slow encroachment of Gommo influence and power into our society, and our increasing dependence on what they provide, despite the Gommo's many assurances and pledges that they merely seek to advance knowledge for the sake of knowledge worldwide.\n\nComing to a head, tensions between those suspicious and those welcoming of the Gommo have resulted in accusations of betraying state secrets and technologies against a known gnomephile who hosts a contingent of the Gommo within their estates at all times."

Reflective of the current questions plaguing [Root.GetName], this year's discussions center around the role of foreigners in the League of Feiten. One group, the reformists, look toward the Gommo and Cannorians and their institutions as something to emulate. Meanwhile, the Old Guard believes that we must not stray from the path that has brought us so much wealth and our balloons. It is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to choose which group gains ascendency for now, but this will clearly be a point of contention for decades to come in this new Age of Silk."
