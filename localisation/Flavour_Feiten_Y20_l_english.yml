Drifting through seemingly endless beds of glowing jellyfish, they have little reason to believe that their children will experience anything different. As the shore slowly recedes from view, paper lanterns released for the prior night's Jellyfish Festival strike a prominent silhouette against the lightening heavens. And in that brief moment, the thoughts of the fishermen are united as they look upward toward the mirror of the sky and wonder what it'd be like to float amongst the lanterns.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nJaher and his Phoenix Legion's ill-fated conquest of §YYanshen§! was - as war often is - brutal, disruptive, and destructive. As Jaher's Legions advanced along the §YYanhe§!, many refugees dispersed south into the sparsely populated §YJellyfish Coast§!. There, they hoped that the Coast's rugged hills and hidden valleys would shelter them from the inevitable rising of Jaher's sun. It was these refugees and their descendants, coalescing after the chaos that was the ousting of the Phoenix, that formed the §YLeague of Feiten§!.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThough a relatively new entity in §YYanshen§!, §YFeiten§! has nevertheless managed to grow rich and catapult itself into relevance off the back of mercantile power. Efforts to convert this wealth into regional influence has been mixed, however. A recent war with the southern savages of §YZyujyut§! has netted §YFeiten§! the gateway to the tea jungle, §YCuihiok§!, but this conquest came at the steep cost of most of §YFeiten's§! fleet, stolen away by the pirate queen Ping Shuang of §YPinghoi§!. To the west, the efforts of §YFeiten§! and §YTianlou§! has led to the splintering of §YXiyun§!. Even now, those two countries fight to imprint their influence on the fledgling §YLuoyip§!. This conflict is only exacerbated by the fact that §YTianlou§!, the jewel of §YYanshen§!, has far and away the richest and most well-established merchant fleets this side of the Kharunyana. If §YFeiten§! wishes to leave its mark on the world, conflict with the city of temples and their entrenched eunuchs and traders is inevitable.\n\nThe city of §YFeiten§! itself lurches toward a flickering future. For centuries, the harbour had been the launching point for minor whaling expeditions by the natives of the area. Everyone knew that whale oil burned the longest and cleanest of any animal fat, and the small amount harvested with every whale hunt was perfect to use in the annual celebratory Jellyfish Festival to fill the skies with floating lanterns. But, why waste something with such interesting properties on mere toys? With §YFeiten§! looking for any advantage against its rivals, the true potential of whale oil has only just started to be realized..."

It is no surprise that they have become experts at warfare and the technologies of war, as we have seen from our gnomish friends.\n\nWith such large distances between, however, it is hard to get a sense of what their actual society looks like or what we can learn from it.

Though Yanshen has had eyeglasses for many centuries, we have not developed the same advances in telescopes, spyglasses, and windows that the Cannorians have. Our Shuimu pilots very quickly figured out how useful these devices are atop a balloon, but with no domestic production at all, have had to resort to buying from Cannorian merchants at exorbitant prices.\n\nIf we can establish a glassworks on our own shores, we can wean off our dependence on Cannorian glass and begin to design our own inventions and innovations with the material."

With their slight build and penchant for yearning for flight, the Goldscales have proven to be reliable airshipmen by the earlier adopters of balloons among our merchants, even if they were originally only brought along primarily as good luck charms.

Though still respected and a required reading for any general, it is treated as more of a philosophical rather than practical work today.\n\nOur expertise as the originators of balloon and airship warfare means that we have accumulated much knowledge over the years, enough to pen an "Art of War" for the modern age that will be circulated and read as widely as the original: The Aeronaut's Handbook."

In its raw form, the powder is extremely volatile and dangerous - to ramp up production and fully take advantage of this new discovery, we must build up facilities suited to handle and produce nitroglycerin safely."

Central to this web is the "cloud corridor", a loop that starts and ends in Feiten. Our balloons take off laden with goods from across Yanshen, following the Yanhe until we reach the Xianjie and Kharunyana river. After making a tidy profit buying and selling spices, they make north for the Serpentspine, before flying directly across it to the Lake Federation. This way, the vast steppes full of facestealers and uncooperative southward currents of northern Haless can be avoided. After trading with the Lake Federation, it is a relatively short trip taking those southward currents back down to Feiten again."

 flavor_feiten.1.title:0 "Whaling Expedition: Setting Off"
 flavor_feiten.1.desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] looks over the rickety fishing boat, despair writ plain across his face. From [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] vantage point atop the pier, the boat appears entirely too in danger of capsizing as it rolled with with the minor tides close to shore to handle a few tuna, much less the ship sized whales that were to be their quarry. Noticing [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s trepidation, the captain of the ship limps over, a slight grin on his face.\n\n    "She may not look like much, but she's served me well in over a dozen hunts. And I wager she'll serve for a dozen more."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is in the process of turning to give a grateful nod as the ocean finally wins the tug of war, a rogue wave washing over the boat's deck to a chorus of loud curses from those on deck. The nod curdles to a shudder and the captain's grin, of course, only grows wider as [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s face turns pale."
 flavor_feiten.1.a:0 "Time to set sail!"
 flavor_feiten.2.title:0 "Whaling Expedition: Bored at Sea"
 flavor_feiten.2.desc:0 "Being at sea was, fundamentally, boring. Oh, there were always tasks to be done, from patching holes in the sails, to scraping and cleaning accumulated salt and dirt. Even these tasks were denied to [Root.Monarch.GetName] on account of his status as a guest, however, and so the days following a too-long period of seasickness were filled with monotony as the whaling vessel sailed through open ocean.\n\nEver the entrepreneur, [Root.Monarch.GetName] figured that this could be a good chance to talk with some of the crew of the ship, learn something about their lifestyles and whaling itself, and incorporate that into future endeavors."

 flavor_feiten.3.title:0 "Whaling Expedition: Whale Sighted!"
 flavor_feiten.3.desc:0 "Frantic cries of "Whale Sighted!" carry through the ship suddenly, followed by the heavy stomp of boots on wood. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is jolted out of their sleep and rushes deck side, where the harpooners and rowers are already preparing to launch. No one pays [Root.Monarch.GetName] any mind, fixated as they are on the flickering crescent of the whale's tale and blast of its blowhole as it swims just underneath the surface of the ocean ahead.\n\nThe air is heavy with pent up energy and the potential of action - so much so that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is compelled to do something, anything, despite lacking the years of experience that these sailors have."

 flavor_feiten.4.satBack:0 "The small harpoon boats launch one by one, each accompanied by great splashes and violent rocking as the whaling boat jettisons the weight of each smaller vessel. They skim like tiny water striders toward the beast, coordinating as to not startle the whale. After catching up to the whale and matching its speed, the harpooners ready for a signal. And upon getting it, their missiles arc high like shooting stars, glinting in the sunlight; most miss, falling short, but one embeds itself in the right flank of the whale, and the chase is on!\n\nThe whale darts left, then right, trying desperately to dislodge the harpoon in its flank, a crimson cloud billowing out from the wound. Unsuccessful, it dives, and the harpoon rope starts to whip and unwind from the boat. Just as it looks like the rope will snap taut, it stops unwinding as the whale runs out of breath and starts streaking toward the surface again. The other harpoon boats take full advantage as it surfaces and lance the whale, aiming to pierce any of its vital organs. Weakened so, the whale's movements slow, until it ceases entirely. Ragged cheers rise up among the crew - finally, the culmination of months of tracking, and a guarantee of payout once back at port.\n\nNow, the crew set to the exhausting task of butchering the whale, before sharks and scavengers can set upon the carcass. Afterwards, it was back to Feiten."
 flavor_feiten.4.descInjured:0 "With a great splash, the harpoon boat drops into the ocean. With oars slicked and face blinded by ocean spray, it took all of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s effort just to cling on and follow the fragile craft's captain's orders. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s world narrowed to a single action: that of pulling and resetting and pulling and resetting the oar. An eternity later, the call to slow down was finally yelled, a sign that the harpoon boats were close to the whale. All eyes were focused on the harpooners now, who stood ready with weapons in hand.\n\n         "Fire!"\n\nAnd suddenly, their missiles arc high like shooting stars, glinting in the sunlight. For a split second, it seems that all will miss, but one embeds itself in the right flank of the whale. The oarsmen, including [Root.Monarch.GetName], explode into action, frantically pumping their oars to get away as fast as possible, lest the whale's thrashing score a direct hit on the fragile craft. The whale darts left, then right, trying desperately to dislodge the harpoon in its flank, a crimson cloud billowing out from the wound. Unsuccessful, it dives, and the harpoon rope starts to whip and unwind from the boat. Abruptly, the rope snaps taut, having gotten tangled on a piece of wood. The harpoon boat starts to get dragged to and fro, at risk of capsizing unless something is done. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] is closest, they...\n\n§rPut all their might into dislodging the rope. With a final burst of adrenaline, the rope breaks free, whipping [Root.Monarch.GetName] square in the chest and knocking [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] on their back in a tangled heap. [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets injured!§!\n\nWith the rope free, the boat settles. Eventually, the rope stops unwinding as the whale runs out of breath and starts streaking toward the surface again. The other harpoon boats take full advantage as it surfaces and lance the whale, aiming to pierce any of its vital organs. Weakened so, the whale's movements slow, until it ceases entirely.

 flavor_feiten.40.desc:0 "In the past, whaling has been an individual endeavor. To cover as much ocean surface as possible, ships spread out, scanning widely for the elusive whale. As whaling has exploded in Feiten, so too have our techniques and hunts.\n\nInstead of a singular ship sailing out into open ocean, a spotter fleet now patrols the Jellyfish Coast. Once a suitable beast is found, the fleet works together to drive the whale into shallower waters and tire it out, where specialized, smaller harpoon boats quickly pounce. The days of famous captains making their fortune off of a single successful hunt may be over, but the group hunting method is much more consistent and reliable overall."

 flavor_feiten.41.title:0 "Whaling: Collapse of the Coastal Fisheries"
 flavor_feiten.41.desc:0 "The world's insatiable need for more whales has been a great boon to our economy, but this hunger has led to a boom in would-be hunters and fortune seekers who strip the old hunting grounds down to the bone. The discovery of greater fisheries out in open ocean has alleviated this somewhat, saving our industry, but the coastal fisheries along the Yanshen Coast have now been completely tapped out.\n\nOur advisors suggest implementing a hunting license system to give the whales time to recover.

But we have never had to outfit an expedition like this one.\n\nBecause today we are sending an expedition to Cannor, to make our name on the world stage. We will not bring back carcass or coin, but scholar, philosopher, and artisan, seeking their finest minds to bring our airships to a new zenith.\n\nThe aims are lofty, bit the business at hand more practical.

But for all our lofty heights let us look down on the continent unfurling below, we were still awestruck when we approached Anbenncóst. Feiten has ballooned in recent years, but even now it is but a pale rival to the city of the world's desire. Anbenncóst is massive, and seemingly every inch filled with buildings and people -- from above, the chaos of The Bilge is nonapparent, and the haphazard arrangement of Elvendocks belies its wealth and nobility.\n\nBy pre-arranged approval, we docked at one of the tallest spires in the Temple District, sole property of the Order of Chroniclers. We had not even begun to tie ropes to their hastily-assembled skydock when we were faced with a veritable platoon of guildsmen -- peppering us with questions, sketching the Shuimu Engineering Cadre's creations, and, well, chronicling our visit.\n\nIn due time, however, the eager scholars were herded away, and we were greeted by the Guild's leader. There will be a welcome feast, it seems, a chance to meet the Guild's best and brightest. And so now we must determine our approach.\n\nWe could look for a specific sort of scholar whose expertise we could use in Feiten, and concentrate on impressing them to the point they will surely join us on our return. A theologian, fascinated to debate and discuss High Philosophy? A scientist to help us break new ground in our research? Or perhaps a philosopher, well-equipped to contribute and inform novel developments?\n\nWe have not aimed low with this voyage, however, and this is no time to start. Why settle for a single guild representative, when we deserve a multitude? If we impress the guild master sufficiently, she will undoubtedly see that Feiten merits a guild chapter of its own, to record for posterity the greatness we are building."

The land was dotted with orchards, with green rolling hills filling the space between them. It is easy to see why they call this the Winebay, and it is hard to imagine just how many thousands of bottles-worth of grapes we saw growing beneath us.\n\nThe pattern continued almost all the way to Lorentainé proper, though it's tall elven spires made it an icon on the horizon for days. They had cleared a small field outside the city walls for us to land in, from what apparently was once a vineyard, now made fallow by a grape-killing fungus. Leaving a small guard with the skyships, we proceeded into the city, to present ourselves at the court of [67.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [67.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\nThere is to be a ball tonight, serving the best of the region's wines, at which our delegation will be guests of honor.

(The same cannot be true for Esmarian river parties, we spotted a smoke-plume over Seinathil from what must have been revelry gone awry).\n\nOur voyage's final visit was to Giberd, the sole gnomish country in the Empire of Anbennar, and a major hub for Cannorian artificery. It houses the Gommo's Imperial Branch, and while the world-spanning gnomish artificers guild may not match our Shuimu engineers' mastery of sky-ships, they more than make up for it with their expertise in so many other areas.\n\nThey are our only destination with a proper skydock, and the smooth landing is quickly followed by a torrent of inquiry from the gnomes. What's behind our choice of wood? Does porcelain open up long-term damestear storage? How did we solve the propellant-mass problem? It is like flying through a storm, except instead of being pelted by rain, each droplet is a small figure quickly asking detailed and specific questions.\n\nThe gnomes are clearly fascinated by us (or the Shiumu work that brought us, at least), and any member of the Gommo will cross the world in pursuit of answers -- and would undoubtedly come to Feiten. We have our pick of experts: engineers a plenty, as well as some gnomes with ideas on how to use artificery, not just develop it.

It has not been that long, truly. But already, the city looks different, and they dock at an air-spire that was simply not there when the voyage left. The Shuimu engineering apprentices taking on ships' lines have unfamiliar faces, and nearby sky vessels are clearly built with some updated design.\n\nBut as he waits for the Cannorian passengers to disembark, the captain is proud. Feiten has flown around the world, and brought back some of Cannor's jewels. More will come -- more voyages, more visitors, more glory. But for now, there is a small home for him to return to, a garden to visit, and a tree to pace around.

Their innards were filled with smoke, their red exterior is charred, and in some places the heat was so intense it warped and melted the very earth the temples are built on. They may some day recover, but for now, it is as if we had taken a most precious painting and set it ablaze.\n\nAnd that is what, roughly, philosophers of every school are claiming we did. In poem, treatise, oratory, formal letter, and more, schools often at odds are joined together in condemning our recent acts.

And today, on the steps of Feiten's grand workshop, he lit himself on fire.\n\nA note we found in his room explains why: the shame of seeing engineering used for devastation, the horror that the Shuimu Engineering Cadre would abet such crimes, the resolve that this death by fire was truly but one compared to the thousands upon thousands who died like this in Tianlou.\n\nIn the aftermath, it seems many who work on the Shuimu agree with Zhangang, and are refusing to work on airships if they are to be used for such violence."

There is too much in the way of parochial squabbles, too much fear of being the first to fall, and ultimately, too much dread that even the largest coalition would lose. But out of the Tianlou firestorm, it seems that last factor melted away, and the rest could be overcome. Suddenly, we could go against Haless's most deadly army with a trick up our sleeves -- or in the skies, as it were.\n\nThat opportunity was enough to build this coalition. But now we must put it to the test, and send our balloons against the enemy. We could concentrate them with our own forces, but that would risk our nominal allies succumbing again to fear. Alternatively, we could lend their armies brigades of scouting balloons, or even our own war balloons, so that every force that marches against the Command has a reason to believe they will win. (Of course, the technology and plans will not be shared in any way, shape, or form).\n\nThe map is laid out before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the battle orders drafted, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will..."

But even though none can rival the Shuimu cadre's adeptness at balloon engineering, our generals are still adjusting their way of thinking to this new dimension of combat. The war-planning session today made that clear -- but also just how much it makes possible.\n\nIt started as an off-hand wish: "If only we could remove their threat without defeating each and every army against us." It became a possibility when our head Shuimu engineer spoke up: "You know, it would almost be easier to load a balloon with supplies and a small complement of munitions, and drop them somewhere deep inside the enemy, than constantly outfit massive fleets to win individual battles..." And then, after some quick calculations -- followed by many hours working through the logistical pieces -- it became a genuine plan.\n\nThe Command's Grand Marshals have brought war to Haless. So we will bring war to them -- directly to them. Spies report that our foe's beating heart is their great warcamp in Sarilavhan, a military base that is almost as dense as Tianlou. If we destroyed it, we would undoubtedly strike a blow deeper than any single defeat on the battlefield could achieve.

We hoped against hope that fighting together, with support in the skies, we could at least stop such an implacable foe, if not force them back.\n\nBut it worked. It worked! Some of our airships were just recently constructed, but they still brought down countless hobgoblins. Coordination between forces was shaky at best, but we fought together when it counted. Our lines sometimes bent, but they never broke.\n\nNot too long ago, diplomats came to Feiten to excoriate the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] over what our airships unleashed. But today, as our victory is celebrated across all Yanshen, every foreign diplomat in Feiten is getting drunk on rice wine with delight, and many are toasting the very ships they once condemned. It is a party that [Root.Monarch.GetName] will join soon enough, but first there is a decision to be made.\n\nTomorrow, all those diplomats will wake up (many with a hangover). And they will wake to a land, though victorious, has still been ravaged by war. Battlefields dot once-fertile land like scars, farmers and artisans have died fighting as soldiers, and even fields untouched by direct conflict were trampled under tens of thousands of boots. We have been Yanshen's savior in war. Will we be its savior in peace, as well?\n\nWe could direct resources across the land, even using skyships to transport goods where rebuilding is most required. We would undoubtedly ingratiate ourselves to our neighbours (and we could probably leverage that into some trade benefits, too). But we have flown so long over lands not our own -- there are so many graves to dig and people to mourn, not to mention the new designs our Shuimu are already drafting.

But come now, see the world, through a Feiten jellyfish's eyes.\n\nThe flight over Yanshen is the most familiar, but often the most chaotic -- constant messenger hawks exchange letters between skyships and skyposts, and the risk of a mid-air collision is real. The Xianjie's mists preclude any interesting observations, and it is not until Rahen that one can truly admire the vista below, picking out the most impressive High Temple complexes.\n\nThe Marutha's warm updrafts will propel you over the Paravimvhata range, and soon you will fly high above Ebbušubtu (and do note, with a smile, that even a place this holy could not deny the utility of having a small skyport nearby). When you arrive in Bulwar and are swarmed by merchants' flying carpets offering wares from a thousand bazaars, conceal any disdain at their inferior craft -- there is no need to be impolite.\n\nThe Divenhal is beautiful, the sunlight warm and a sparkling blue blanket below, but do not lose your edge. You will need all your wits about you when you dock in Anbenncóst, and trade for the Dragon Coast's newest gadgets and Konwell's most erudite publications. If you take aboard a black-robed Rector, well, consider it an honour (one that should instantly sober you up).\n\nThen it is west, ever west. You will cross to Aelantir in a matter of weeks (much improved from the elves' millennium), and if you look closely, you can see the Ruinrim's outline in the ocean's patterns. Each skyport here is different, from the Triarchy's newfangled designs to the bizarre array in Kheionai (no Kheion would go without!). But most importantly, do little but concrete business at the Eordan skyport; the various faiths may be united in their appreciation of Feiten's commerce, but wage brutal political war to determine who has access and control. Make no promises, no allies, and no enemies.\n\nDo you grow weary? Good, riding the Great Storm's outskirts should shake you awake as it speeds you on your way. And then, when you see balloons in the distance, where balloons have floated for centuries, but now fly and soar to heights once unimaginable -- then, you will know you are home."

 flavor_feiten.208.desc:0 "A birth, and a death. That's what [Root.Monarch.GetName] is thinking of as he floats lazily through the skies. Both took place aboard an airship, both took place at roughly the same time, and both, he thinks, illuminate just what the League of Feiten has become.\n\nThe birth happened aboard a small merchant airship that plied local trade along the Cloud Corridor. It was unplanned but uneventful -- the pregnant mother, who had flown ships in Bulwar and Aelantir long before her marriage, "would be damned if a quick jaunt in friendly skies was too force a wind to ride." It was probably not the first child  born aloft, given the lengthy journeys to Cannor, but the child was still presented to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] when the ship landed in Feiten, a glint of sunshine amidst the grey morass that is paperwork.\n\nThe death [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not hear of directly, no, it as a piece of gossip overheard as two messengers departed his chambers. Old Man Lee, they called him, a man who had hunted whales in a time long past, and even as the ship he worked on was refurbished and retrofitted into a merchant vessel, no one would refuse him when he went aboard for each departure with harpoon in hand, ready for the hunt that never came. In the interim, he would tell stories to the crew (often decades his younger), lose a little coin in minor gambling (though by journey's end it was always returned as his 'wages'), and nap in a stern-side hammock. It was doing the last one that he passed; the crew were amazed at how he slept through a small gust-storm, until they tried and failed to wake him. It is not the first death in the air -- the Shuimu Engineering Cadre keeps detailed records of every soul lost to mechanical defect or mishap, and war is brutally unsparing no matter how far above a battlefield one floats.\n\nIs this his people, now? Who are born in the skies, who ply the winds all their life, until there they die?\n\nNot quite. Now he has drifted a few dozen leagues south of Feiten proper, and floats above the towns and villages that yet dot the Jellyfish Coast. In the steam-powered workshops below, countless weave cloth or forge metal or carve wood, devoting a lifetime's labour to filling the Shuimu workshops but never partaking of the engineers' craft.\n\nTheir lives are shaped by it all the same, though, not just their work. The bottle of Lencori wine they sip from at night, the latest tract from the Rectorate they study after shifts, the steam-powered mechanisms that ease a life in countless ways.\n\nDoes this make his people a people of the skies? No. Ownership is the other way around. From the youngest child to the oldest citizen: the sky belongs to them. Every inch, every breeze, every horizon yet to come. And where does that leave him, of course, if not the Master of the Skies?"

 flavor_feiten.210.desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] eyes the gathered assembly Yangcheng College's great lecture hall with pride - surely this was the greatest collection of minds in all Haless. If this diverse group of Gommo representatives, religious leaders, Yangcheng alchemists, and Shuimu engineers could not crack the problem, then it was never solvable to begin with. There was one final question before the kickoff could commence in earnest: who would lead this initiative? Too many cooks spoil the broth, afterall, and it was vital that there was clear leadership and direction. Surveying the expectant crowd, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sees several possible options.\n\nThe first option would be to hand over leadership to [Root.GetName]'s own Shuimu Engineering Cadre. It is the Cadre's own problem, in the end, and they are very familiar with the unique constraints of our Shuimu.\n\nYangcheng College's Xuézhe of the Chemics are well versed in alchemy and chemistry, having devoted their entire lives to research and discovery of the basic elements of our material plane.[Root.getLighterThanAirDescGnomishAllies][Root.getLighterThanAirDescRavelian]"

Two years of experiments, failed and otherwise, have left indelible marks in the main alchemy labs and testing grounds: a shorn corner on a table, the floor stained a suspicious yellow, black scorch marks on the ceiling. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was, of course, not visiting to reprimand the scientists on shoddy safety practices, though perhaps every hiss of gas and clink of alchemical flask elicited a greater wince than it would have otherwise. No, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was here to survey the path forward, for the research at Yangcheng College has finally borne fruit.\n\nOil of vitriol, a substance known for centuries by alchemists for its acidic properties and harsh nature, once poured on scrap iron, will produce a brilliant blue dye. Done in a closed vessel, a gas violently flares out - one that can fill a silken canvas bag and make it float into the skies.[Root.getLighterThanAirDescElectrolysisMages][Root.getLighterThanAirDescCoal]\n\nIt will likely take more years still to fully realize the path forward, but at least now, the light at the end of the tunnel can be seen."

Their mithril industry is surely tightly guarded, but we cannot hope to take advantage of it for our airships without giving up some of our own secrets. We can arrange for a contingent of their artisans and experts to come to our workshops to work the mithril that we purchase according to our designs and under our supervision, though this will surely be prohibitively expensive. Or, we can share specifications with them directly and trust in their integrity."

Though the vast height that our Shuimu can operate at deters most attackers, feral harpies, wyverns, and all sorts of other monstrosities are a constant nuisance, especially for any not traveling in a larger group, like many of our solitary traders. With the unique lightness, strength, and flexibility of mithril, these nuisances can be allayed.

We know well the benefits of learning from the best and brightest, as we have learned from our experiences with the Gommo. To hasten the development of this source of fuel for our balloons and airships, our Shuimu Engineering Cadre have put forth three different areas in which we can benefit from sending a research team to learn from.\n\nThe first is the dwarovrod, the ancient rail tracks of the fallen dwarven empire. In recent years, the dwarven reclaimers of their homeland have not only restored many of their old rails, but improved upon them for the modern era. Many of their trains are supplemented with coal powered steam pumps to clear out old mines and flooded passages alike.\n\nSecond, the naval dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr have developed a new class of naval ships that they have named "ironclads". Massive and built of heavy metal, these low-sitting ships take full advantage of coal-fired engines to drive them, in lieu of wind and sail. They may have the most relevant knowledge for our purposes.\n\nFinally, we have heard rumours of a city in Cannor where the river and skies run black with industry - Alenath. Though not directly related to our goal, the magnates of the Alen are the most experienced in the world with coal and steam technology. As long as we can learn the limitations and opportunities of coal power from them, we should be able to adopt their knowledge for our own."

It is the mundane among all that has been brought from Aelantir, however, that concerns [Root.Monarch.GetName] today.\n\nDozens of profitable new crops discovered in the tropical climes of Aelantir, among them new varietals of sugarcane, sweet potatoes, and cocoa. Many of the more enterprising of our merchants wish to trial cultivation of these crops in [Root.GetName], to cut out the need for a lengthy ocean voyage. Growing these would of course come at the expense of other crops. Conflict grows between two factions of the League of Feiten - the communities who depend on traditional tea plantations for their livelihood and trade, and the city merchants who see profit and potential in these new world crops."

Many warn of the hidden price of our progress - the slow encroachment of Gommo influence and power into our society, and our increasing dependence on what they provide, despite the Gommo's many assurances and pledges that they merely seek to advance knowledge for the sake of knowledge worldwide.\n\nComing to a head, tensions between those suspicious and those welcoming of the Gommo have resulted in accusations of betraying state secrets and technologies against a known gnomephile who hosts a contingent of the Gommo within their estates at all times."

Meanwhile, the Old Guard believes that we must not stray from the path that has brought us so much wealth and our balloons.

 flavor_feiten.310.t:"Substitute for Whale Oil"
 flavor_feiten.310.desc:"As it turns out, the whaling industry's collapse has had more serious consequences than we could have possibly imagined - the vital fuel on which our jellyfish blimps depend, whale oil, is now in a state of severe scarcity, directly affecting every aspect of Feiten's economy. If we can't find a substitute for whale oil as quickly as possible, the consequences are clear: the fall of Feiten will be even more rapid than a burnt-out balloon.\n\nTo this end, several emergency government meetings have been held, and the finest artificers and artisan throughout the country have been called in to study alternative fuels. Straw, wood, and even damestear batteries were intensively tested, but they always failed in the end, either due to a low calorific value or yield issues. That was  when one blacksmith from Luogang spoke up during a meeting that was quickly heading to a dead end:\n\n”There is this black ore in our home,” he said,  “that produces a powerful fire when burned - we generally use it to make steel, but perhaps we could use it for this?.'\n\nTwo weeks later, the artificers and the mages sent in their reports at the same time. One report suggested that the black ore had a calorific value far higher than whale oil, enough to support the flight of even our largest airships; the other report pointed out that there was a large amount of black ore contained underneath Luogang - enough that, with the size of Feiten's fleet today, we wouldn't have to worry about fuel for at least a hundred years."
 flavor_feiten.310.a:"What are we waiting for? Coal will be Feiten's future!"
 flavor_feiten.311.t:"The Black Gold Age"
 flavor_feiten.311.desc:"With bated breath, the crowd gathers on the precipice of the seaside cliff. Beside them is the latest third-generation Zongmin-class airships, tethered to the rocks while the first batch of coal, extracted from the mines of Luogang, was piled into the combustion chambers after a brief treatment by the artificers. A group of mages were on standby, calming the constant winds that normally battered these cliffsides, but ready to release their spells once the balloon was airborne.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood alone on the deck of the airship, gazing out at the Feiten Bay in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. No one could tell what [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was thinking, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face a mask of stern determination - once everything was ready, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gave the signal. As the black ore in the combustion chamber was ignited, a rising heat filled the silk balloon. The hull began to lift, the electroplated metal of the surface glinting in the sunlight. As the dockhands on the ground untied the ropes, the airship lifted swiftly into the air - when the mages unleashed their own wind magics,  the Zongmin airships surged forwards along the coastline, propelled by their Caged Firebird Engines.\n\nThe crowd on the ground erupted into celebration, as the normally cautious jellyfish engineers jumped higher and cheered louder than anyone else. From the deck, [Root.Monarch.GetName] looked down at the increasingly distant takeoff platform - finally, he allowed [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] to smile.\n\nToday, Feiten conquered the sky once more."

 flavor_feiten.312.t:"Facility Location"
 flavor_feiten.312.desc:"In order to ensure that the work of the Shuimu Engineering Cadre can continue as normal, a decree for the creation of a new jellyfish research facility has been approved. Though Shuimu's engineers and artificers have had at least three private duels over the location of the facility (despite orders to stop), in the end they have presented a report that listed several possible locations.\n\nIn the report, the engineers made it clear that, considering the needs of Feiten's future development, priority should be given to establishing a research facility on the Jellyfish Coast. We ought to be careful when choosing a location - besides the fact that asking for another report may well result in more unsanctioned artificer duels, construction will take years, and have a major impact on whatever location we choose."
