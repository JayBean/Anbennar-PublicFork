  mulen_take_the_river_desc:0 "The Upper Suran is the next vital link of the Golden Highway that will carry us towards the fertile lands of Bulwar. Pressed into our highlands for centuries, we must break out of the Salahad by force."

  mulen_repel_the_gnolls_title:0 "Repel the Gnolls"
  mulen_repel_the_gnolls_desc:0 "The gnolls have been a vicious thorn in the side of Bulwar for years uncounted, sacrificing humans and elves to their demons. If we were the ones to pluck out this barb, then Bulwari relations may advance even if we too are regarded as monsters."

  mulen_a_western_coast_title:0 "A Western Coast"
  mulen_a_western_coast_desc:0 "With the sea so tantalizingly close to our territory, how could we not desire to close the gap? Our trade yearns to flow freely, and with access to the vibrant markets of the Divenhal sea, it most certainly shall."

  mulen_resurgence_of_the_shadnatu_title:0 "Resurgence of the Šadnatu"
  mulen_resurgence_of_the_shadnatu_desc:0 "Fleeing the Gnolls, the Šadnatu people took refuge in the city of Zanšap. Now that we control the territory, we can do the same as we did with the Mašnsih and call the Šadnatu back to live in their ancestral lands."
  mulen_shadnatu_tt:0 "All high elevation gnollish provinces in the Šad Sur range owned by Mulén or its subjects become ruled by the New Sun Cult Šadnatu, but gain devastation as the gnolls are removed from power.\n"

  mulen_my_way_for_the_highway_desc:0 "Restoring the Golden Highway in Bulwar Proper would be easiest with cooperation from local rulers. After warming them up to our intentions, we'll deliver a simple offer. \"Allow us free access along the Golden Highway and we shall send merchants. Deny us, and we shall send soldiers.\""

  mulen_successful_venture_title:0 "Successful Venture"

  mulen_overtures_to_the_raheni_title:0 "Overtures to the Raheni"
  mulen_overtures_to_the_raheni_desc:0 "With the stabilization of Bulwari trade, the attention of Mulén has turned to the neglected east, towards the exotic riches of Rahen. Dyes, ivory, silk, and porcelain overflow there amidst the ruins of yet more unrestored sections of the Golden Highway. With official invitations sent to the merchants of Rahen, a tidal wave of exchanges is imminent."
  mulen_raheni_overtures_tt:0 "All countries in the Golden Highway Rahen Coast group must have §Yimproved relations§! to +50, or +90 for rivals and enemies."

  mulen_contract_with_the_raheni_title:0 "Contract with the Raheni"
  mulen_contract_with_the_raheni_desc:0 "As the masters of the Golden Highway, Mulén's interest in Rahen was undisguised to all. This made negotiations with the Raheni succinct yet effective: Mulén shall provide endowments for the reconstruction of ruined Golden Highway sections in exchange for unrestricted access to the markets of the east. Stipulated also was the granting special autonomy to Davharral, so that it may act as a link between our lands."

  mulen_free_flowing_trade_title:0 "Free Flowing Trade"
  mulen_free_flowing_trade_desc:0 "The Golden Highway now shines from Brasan to Sramaya in a way not seen since the time of Jaher and Jaerel. The caravans flow in a ceaseless torrent, carrying precious porcelain to the west and Bulwari pomegranates and grapes to the east. Thus exalted, Mulén is recognized as the undisputed Matriarch of the Highway."

  mulen_pressurizing_the_flow_title:0 "Pressurizing the Flow"
  mulen_pressurizing_the_flow_desc:0 "While the Golden Highway affords us mastery over trade by land in Rahen, there remains a maritime ingress into our markets that we currently exercise limited control over. There is no reason to leave such a gap unexploited, and so let us establish a naval presence in the gulf to attract merchants by sea."

  mulen_capture_the_highway_title:0 "Capture the Highway"
  mulen_capture_the_highway_desc:0 "The Desert Elves now hold the remnants of the Golden Highway in the east, and though in disrepair it still has great value. Capturing it is of utmost importance if we are to link our valley with the outside world."

  mulen_begin_the_restoration_title:0 "Begin the Restoration"
  mulen_begin_the_restoration_desc:0 "The Golden Highway built by Jaher was a major trade route that connected the two ends of his empire, and collapsed during its fall. If we were to restore it, Mulén would be positioned to profit off the caravans passing between Bulwar and Rahen. With our wingtips touching both worlds, Mulén shall control and safeguard the passage of goods."

  mulen_avamezan_valley_desc:0 "The abundant farmlands of the Avamezan valley are now in sight, and we need only follow the Suran river westward to join up with it. This valley, famed for its tranquility, must now undergo a necessary and brief period of strife to fold it under our wings. Afterward, a forward fort along the mountains overseeing the valley shall ensure the continued prosperity of the farmlands below."
  mulen_avamezan_tt:0 "All owned flatlands provinces in the Far Bulwar region will receive"

  mulen_promote_the_locals_title:0 "Promote the Locals"
  mulen_promote_the_locals_desc:0 "The gnolls of the Salahad make for terrible subjects, as their long reliance on slavery has made them disinclined to work the fields for themselves, and their cultural tendency to rally around powerful figures means that gnollish revolts will be a persistent concern. By contrast, the humans they oppress could make for excellent subjects. If we restore local Mašnsih rulership, they would be grateful and could be integrated into harpy society with ease."
  mulen_masnsih_tt:0 "All gnollish flatland provinces North of the Salahad Bay in Bulwar owned by Mulén or its subjects become instead ruled by the Jadd Mašnsih or New Sun Cult Surani / Zanite, but gain devastation leaving the gnolls power in the minority.\n\nAll mountainous gnollish provinces in Far Bulwar or Salahad owned by Mulén or its subjects become ruled by Harpies of our religion, but gain devastation.\n"

  mulen_second_link_in_the_chain_title:0 "Second Link in the Chain"
  mulen_second_link_in_the_chain_desc:0 "With the second section of the Golden Highway complete, trade has begun to flourish. So near to Bulwar, the force of greed is irresistible now to merchants and caravans, compelling them into our open - and exacting - arms."

  mulen_secure_the_northern_pass_title:0 "Secure the Northern Pass"
  mulen_secure_the_northern_pass_desc:0 "The centaurs have been at our gates before, and they are sure to come back again in due time. We shall reinforce the defenses at Çhórfo and send out a scouting expedition to see what awaits in the plains."

  mulen_a_new_trade_route_title:0 "A New Trade Route"
  mulen_a_new_trade_route_desc:0 "The expedition has returned with an unexpected report of a prosperous civilization on the other side of the plains, of which neither we nor our neighbors had previous knowledge. A new contact is a tempting prospect, and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has gathered support from the Sparrows, taking the initiative to lead this endeavor. After pushing through the centaurs, they will explore diplomatic and commercial opportunities with these isolated humans."

  mulen_secure_a_route_title:0 "Secure a Route"
  mulen_secure_a_route_desc:0 "Muléni martial traditions evolved to fight against centaur raiders that came through the pass in generations past, and they continue to prove their utility as we seize territory in the plains. The Sparrows call specific attention to this traditional aspect of their conquests in order to reinforce their mandate. Their next goals are to secure a port as well as a defensive position at high elevation."
  mulen_secure_a_route_tt:0 "\nReduces development cost in all frontier provinces by §G20%§! for 15 years"

  mulen_facilitate_trade_title:0 "Facilitate Trade"
  mulen_facilitate_trade_desc:0 "Having never seen harpies before, the bewildered humans are unblemished by prior histories with us. The Sparrows have taken full advantage of this and established ties with the humans of the three lakes, promising mutual defense against the centaurs, as well as initial trade agreements. After explaining the \"unique\" aspects of harpy biology that inform the Muléni policy of human integration (among other races), our territory in the plains has been opened to Triunic migrants."
  mulen_fp_flip_tt:0 "Owned lands in the plains will become the culture and religion of our lake federation ally"

  mulen_propose_joint_roads_title:0 "Propose Joint Roads"
  mulen_propose_joint_roads_desc:0 "The humans of the three lakes have a system of roads of their own, and it would probably seem impressive to those who have never seen the Golden Highway before. But by joining their roads with ours to the south, we can maintain exclusive access to this isolated market while connecting it to the broader economic landscape. The Sparrows report to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that they are certain some arrangement can be made with the Triunic leaders."

  mulen_reunite_the_flocks_title:0 "Reunite the Flocks"
  mulen_reunite_the_flocks_desc:0 "The harpy flocks of the Far Salahad diverged after the Sundering of Siadanlén, and Mulén formed from the followers of Múla Swift-Sparrow's philosophy of persuasion and understanding. We must reunite the flocks with her words on our lips."

  mulen_ghankedheni_relations_title:0 "Ghankedheni Relations"
  mulen_ghankedheni_relations_desc:0 "The Raheni herdsmen of Ghankedhen have suffered many raids from Harpies over the years. If we were to send diplomats rather than raiders, we may be able to learn their techniques of animal husbandry first-hand."
  mulen_ghankedhen_tt:0 "Increases goods produced by 15% for 15 years in all owned wool, livestock, and ivory provinces"

  mulen_szal_mehran_route_title:0 "Szal-Mehran Route"
  mulen_szal_mehran_route_desc:0 "The Mašnsih tribe of the Szal-Mehran capitalized on the collapse of the Golden Highway by establishing their own route that avoided bandits and harpy raiders. But now their caravans are suffering, as the safety of the Golden Highway has been restored under Mulén, leaving little reason for most to consider risking the open desert. It would be a tragedy to allow the unique skills of the Szal-Mehran go to waste. Therefore, to further our own expansion of Golden Highway trade, perhaps a deal can be struck."
  szal_mehran_tt:0 "Investing in the szal-Mehran caravan is now more lucrative."

  mulen_ruler_of_the_far_salahad_title:0 "Ruler of the Far Salahad"
  mulen_ruler_of_the_far_salahad_desc:0 "Through conquest, all of the Far Salahad is under our control. Harpy warriors patrol its wide arid skies for the first time since the era of Siadanlén, and eyes abroad turn to see what power has arisen in the desert. But rather than brutish Siadanlén, a new face meets their gaze."

  mulen_peace_in_the_desert_title:0 "Peace in the Desert"
  mulen_peace_in_the_desert_desc:0 "In order to facilitate safe travel of the Salahad, we must find common ground and broker an armistice with the Desert Elves. Our Elaiénna sisters have had frequent dealings with the elves, and using their connections we will learn from the philosophy of tolerance these elves espouse."
  mulen_armistice_tt:0 "Elves and at least 2 other races either coexisting or integrated"

  mulen_lets_get_down_to_business_title:0 "Let's get Down to Business"
  mulen_lets_get_down_to_business_desc:0 "After many years, the Golden Highway in the Far Salahad has been restored. An island of stability has risen in the desert, and this is a sign that foreign merchants and travelers cannot ignore. They will come cautiously at first, then routinely, and then eagerly as they understand the breadth of new opportunities that await in Mulén."

  mulen_to_unseat_the_suns_title:0 "To Unseat the Suns"
  mulen_to_unseat_the_suns_desc:0 "Now that the flow of coin and goods has started to increase through the highway, we must ensure that we hold a firm grip on it. Many merchants of sunbaked Bulwar have passed through our lands in hopes of trading with Rahen, while scarcely paying tribute to us for generously restoring the route in the first place. For a while, we shall levy a tax on all goods passing through the highway that involve transactions Mulén is not party to, quietly unseating the role of these wayward sun-worshippers."

  mulen_the_merchant_matriarchs_title:0 "The Merchant Matriarchs"
  mulen_the_merchant_matriarchs_desc:0 "As commerce rather than raiding has become the source of wealth in Mulén, a faction of wealthy harpies has arisen. Adopting values from the merchants they encounter, these so-called Merchant Matriarchs have used their fortunes and connections to purchase political power. Many are outraged at this usurpation of norms and have coalesced into a second faction, hoping to protect harpy institutions and the birthright of Múla Swift-Sparrow's descendants."

  mulen_material_gains_title:0 "Material Gains"
  mulen_material_gains_desc:0 "From our explorer and from our merchant contacts, we have learned of the Fieldstalker Gnolls that lie to the south of the Maqeti. Unlike their demon-worshipping brethren that we are familiar with, these gnolls of Haraagtseda worship a goddess of rebirth, recycling, and reforging. Their scrap markets put on their display their skills as cunning merchants and skillful tinkerers. The sum of their traits make these gnolls potentially valuable trading partners - but to be on the firmest footing for initial deals, we must display the skills we have to offer. Beneath Kvangraak the gnolls have uncovered an ancient palace complex that remains only partially excavated. We shall send goblin digging teams to assist in exhuming more chambers to demonstrate our goodwill. After that, it will be easy to make a deal for a new trade route between Kvangraak and our nearby market at Azka-szel-Udam."
  mulen_material_gains_tt:0 "Mulén gains §YTrade from Kvangraak§! (Trade Power: §G50.0§!) in §YHaraagtseda§! as well as the following effect for as long as §YHaraagtseda§! is §Tallied§! or a §Tsubject§!"

  mulen_overseeing_the_bulwari_title:0 "Overseeing the Bulwari"
  mulen_overseeing_the_bulwari_desc:0 "Tensions have risen between the two factions, causing separation into two distinct political and geographical spheres of influence. When the Sparrows broached the subject of increasing trade and relations with Bulwar, the Peacocks gradually took control of the project from their coalescing headquarters in Ekluzagnu. Far from the roosts on the Siadúnan peaks, they have expanded their influence over the Bulwari humans with ease."

  mulen_a_deal_with_the_matriarchs_title:0 "A Deal with the Matriarchs"
  mulen_a_deal_with_the_matriarchs_desc:0 "With the growing size and importance of the hanging cities, they have grown increasingly difficult to manage effectively. The Peacocks have petitioned to be granted local control of the cities in exchange for providing personal investment in future expansions. Though the Sparrows were loath to admit it, they cannot manage the rising complexity of the cities alone."

  mulen_the_southern_wing_title:0 "The Southern Wing"
  mulen_the_southern_wing_desc:0 "The Nalénian Harpies have grown strong and prosperous under our guidance, yet they spurn the Muléni politics of the Sparrows and the Peacocks, preferring instead to remain independent. Their distant history means they take no interest in the words and legacy of Mula Swift-Sparrow, and they consider the Merchant Matriarchs to be land-loving monopolizers with claws too delicate to truly grasp wealth for themselves. The free-spirited natures of the Nalénian are likely a result of their pirate heritage, and their eyes remain fixed outward rather than inward towards Mulén. That attitude is helpful in administering lands far away from Bulwar. In this way, even the wayward southern wing has its place within our greater flock."
  integrating_naleni_cost_4_dip_tt:0 "Integrate Naléni at a cost of §R4§! £dip£ per unit of development"

  mulen_creating_a_constitution_title:0 "Creating a Constitution"
  mulen_creating_a_constitution_desc:0 "The volatile relations between the Sparrows and the Peacocks have led many to fear that a fissure is opening in Muléni society. To prevent the abuses, excesses, and conflicts of the past from occurring again, we must devise a constitution that will legitimize and contain the powers of the two factions."
  mulen_create_constitution_tt:0 "Creates a constitution, limiting the excesses of power from both the Sparrows and the Peacocks"

  mulen_land_of_the_skies_title:0 "Land of the Skies"
  mulen_land_of_the_skies_desc:0 "The phrase may seem to be an oxymoron, but it fits Mulén well. The skies are dominated by our hanging cities and soaring harpies, while the land is traversed by traders and visitors alike. A month-long festival shall begin to celebrate the joining of Bulwar, Rahen, the Dwarovar, the plains, and Sarhal at our crossroads. Mulén - the eponymous Land of the Skies - welcomes guests from all over Halcann, and they make the long trek all the way from Cannor in the West and from Yanshen in the East. No matter from how far, all gather to share the same sky."

  mulen_charm_the_dwarves_title:0 "Charm the Dwarves"
  mulen_charm_the_dwarves_desc:0 "Dwarves are infamously proud and stubborn, and expressed these qualities as the remnant hold resisted our rule. But after a visit from Matriarch Kiríja, it was as though all past grudges melted away. Natural charisma, harpy allure, or the touch of a powerful enchantress? None can say exactly."

  mulen_restart_the_mines_title:0 "Restart the Mines"
  mulen_restart_the_mines_desc:0 "After transferring hands, the mines of Verkal Gulan fell into some disrepair. In exchange for helping to repair the mines, we will receive a cut of the product. In addition, many in the hold considered expanding beyond the safety of its doors and retaking the emptied caverns of the Middle Dwarovar. We find these ambitions agreeable, and by thus investing in these ventures, we will also encourage some dwarves on the surface to return to their hold."

  mulen_liberate_the_maqeti_title:0 "Liberate the Maqeti"
  mulen_liberate_the_maqeti_desc:0 "The Maqeti humans to the south are being ruled over by gnolls and forced to live as slaves. By freeing them from their captors, they could prove useful in pushing back the gnolls. However, vengeful freed slaves must have their fury carefully directed, lest it turn on us as well."
  mulen_maqeti_tt:0 "All gnollish flatland provinces in the Zallirkor or Dasmatuš areas owned by Mulén or its subjects become Maqeti and Old Sun Cult, gaining devastation and leaving gnolls as minorities.\n"

  mulen_mending_the_coffee_coast_title:0 "Mending the Coffee Coast"
  mulen_mending_the_coffee_coast_desc:0 "A slave revolt is never a peaceful affair. Some liberated Maqeti took their vengeance, driving out many of the gnolls who had not already fled. But now it falls on us to ensure that stability returns to the region, and pivot from destruction to creation, so that we may finally see profit from our investment in this region. We shall help the humans reestablish their bountiful coffee fields, build up their industry, and protect the remaining gnolls from further violence. Debts of blood shall no longer be paid: now, coin alone shall rule all transactions."
  mulen_coffee_tt:0 "All owned coffee provinces in the Far Salahad region will receive:"

  mulen_search_for_new_trade_title:0 "Search for New Trade"
  mulen_search_for_new_trade_desc:0 "The rich trade of the inner Gulf of Rahen lies now within our taloned grasp as Muléni merchant ships soar on salted winds. However, the unknown lands on the southern horizon beckon with new opportunities for commerce. We have little to no firsthand knowledge of those lands, so let it be known that Mulén is in the market for guides."

  mulen_disrupting_the_slave_trade_title:0 "Disrupting the Slave Trade"
  mulen_disrupting_the_slave_trade_desc:0 "Dreksaret and Telekenid, the lands to the south, are rife with slavery. Raheni demand for slaves grew so great that Ofehibi kings found that Raghamideshi merchants had bought their thrones out from under them by leveraging accrued debts. When the locals resisted these incursions of foreign influence, masses of Raheni mercenaries and adventurers were dispatched to conquer them directly. The subjugated peoples have since been subjected to intense (and obviously forced) personal participation in the Raheni slave trade, which is a major portion of the trade passing through the Gulf of Rahen.\n\nFor once, Sparrow and Peacock opinions are aligned on this issue: the slave trade between East Sarhal and Rahen should be disrupted and abolished. Sparrows extend their principles of cooperation and understanding to the enslaved, while the Merchant Matriarchs spy an opportunity to send the Gulf of Rahen into economic chaos and swiftly fly to claim newly opened economic spaces. To accomplish this, we must seize and dismantle the slave markets, while promoting local non-slave industries. The famed pearls of Dakmender are one such opportunity."
  mulen_investment_tt:0 "Have §Y2 Local Venture§! trade company investments in the §YKeygas Charter§!"

  mulen_piracy_protection_title:0 "Piracy Protection"
  mulen_piracy_protection_desc:0 "The sundered flocks of the Siadúnan Harpies were reunited under Mulén, all offshoots of the Firanyan Harpies. As Muléni ships began to sail the Gulf of Rahen, we came to learn that harpies had journeyed farther still than we had: the Nalénian Harpies make their roosts along the mountains of Telekenid, and from there they raid the wealth of the gulf, performing acts of piracy on vulnerable ships - including our own. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] commands that this wayward, backwards flock be put under heel to protect Muléni trade interests. Moreover, once integrated, the naval expertise of these seafaring harpies may be used to bolster our maritime presence instead of hindering it."

  mulen_linking_the_coffee_coasts_title:0 "Linking the Coffee Coasts"
  mulen_linking_the_coffee_coasts_desc:0 "For us, the Maqeti coast has earned the nickname of the Coffee Coast. But we've come to discover that there are in truth two coasts replete with coffee production. This second and greater Coffee Coast lies south of Naléni, and by setting up a base of operations in Nalénian lands we may conduct trade between the two coasts."

  mulen_gate_to_the_harpies_desc:0 "Once shunned by merchants for fear of raiders, Baganaš, meaning "Harpy's Gate" in Bulwari, is now the main contact point between Mulén and diplomats traveling the Golden Highway. A vibrant menagerie of peoples pass through here in view of the province's many embassies. It becomes clear to any visiting diplomat that the gate to the harpies is the gate to everywhere."

Rather than leaving them as unrefined jewels, let us develop the industry of Siadúnaiún and Baganaš to combine with the precious metals of the Middle Dwarovar. Additionally, we can draw upon our sources of pearls from Dakmender and ivory from Davharral to craft truly fine jewelry."

  mulen_finding_our_miners_desc:0 "We've learned of goblin tribes that live in the Tree of Stone, and are well-adapted to underground life compared to others, especially harpies. They would make for fine miners of subterranean wealth if we're able to locate and subjugate them. The treasures of the mountain yearn to be freed from stone and be crafted into glittering jewelry and coins. Who are we to deny such a desire?"

  mulen_combined_mining_desc:0 "With the dwarves of Verkal Gulan to the West and our goblins to the East, we've gleaned valuable insights into both of their excavation techniques that will have broad applications for surface mining.

  mulen_protect_the_heros_gate_desc:0 "The unprotected Hero's Gate has long been a problem for the Dwarves of Verkal Gulan, as it has been the surface passageway that leads brigands to the gold-rich hold. With Mulén as the most recent example of these attackers and Verkal Gulan now in our service, it is only proper that we protect this corridor so that the dwarves can open it again for trade."

  mulen_refound_mermigan_desc:0 "Mermigán has long been our capital, but now we require it to expand to become capable of administering our growing country. In contemplating this, we have received an astonishing proposal: climb the mountainside with stoneworks, columns, and archways; create vertical housing under cliff edges; build vast staircases and flight platforms to facilitate travel for both its winged and non-winged residents. Mulén shall realize this vision and found the world's first hanging city."

   flavour_mulen.3.d:0 "A goblin was spotted emerging from the Tree of Stone, and when spotted he ran to speak with the nearby harpies rather than flee. He spoke rapidly and his anger rose as he described the various goblin clan chiefs and the slights each had comitted against him, and urged us to assist him in taking revenge against the tribes of the Tree of Stone. When granted an audience with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the goblin repeated this and offered to use his experience of the labyrinthian tunnels to lead an expedition safely within the mountain, and that any treasures we find or seize would be ours.\n\nWe have been aware of the riches of the mountain for some time, and this might be the perfect opportunity to use this goblin's knowledge to reach and subjugate the Tree of Stone. Then, with investment in mining operations the glittering gems and minerals of the mountain would be ours. Although, this would be a significant investment that we may not have the resources for at the moment."

   flavour_mulen.13.t:0 "The Peacocks: Tax Evasion"
   flavour_mulen.13.d:0 "One of the few methods the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can utilize to contain Merchant Matriarch influence has been levying taxes on personal wealth and trade above a certain size. However, this is a constant struggle as Peacocks frequently skirt these laws with unconsidered loopholes. More recently, they have gained enough control of the Muléni government to outright abolish some of these taxes."
   flavour_mulen.13.a:0 "Despite their individualism, collective greed fosters uncanny unity."

   flavour_mulen.14.t:0 "The Peacocks: Minting Currency"
   flavour_mulen.14.d:0 "The control that the Peacocks have exerted over the Muléni treasury has ebbed and flowed, but now they take full advantage of their influence. This year they have set the minting offices to constant work and devalued Muléni currency, citing abstract economic theories that force their hand lest disaster strike the markets, and by consequence, themselves. Whatever the truth, their inscrutable designs have done considerable damage to our economy and the effect is that these \"immutable laws of the markets\" lessen their injury while increasing that of all others."
   flavour_mulen.14.a:0 "How convenient."

   flavour_mulen.15.t:0 "The Peacocks: Self-Governance"
   flavour_mulen.15.d:0 "The Merchant Matriarchs have long skirted the authority of the [Root.GovernmentName] using the persuasive and coercive power of wealth. Throughout Mulén, their Peacock followers now deepen their roots in key local governances to advance their goals, bypassing, bribing, or banishing administrators. Outraged Sparrows liken it to the establishment of nations within a nation, ruled by coin rather than law."
   flavour_mulen.15.a:0 "An unscrupulous subversion."

   flavour_mulen.16.t:0 "The Peacocks: Reputation Smeared"
   flavour_mulen.16.d:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been mired in controversy after unflattering rumors were spread throughout the royal court and eventually to society at large. The Peacocks are suspected as the responsible party for fabricating or uncovering these supposed truths. [Root.Monarch.GetName] denies them all vehemently, but none can say for sure which are authentic and which are exaggerations or lies, and the uncertainty has begun to tarnish [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reputation among her people."

   flavour_mulen.17.t:0 "The Sparrows: Bad Economic Policy"
   flavour_mulen.17.d:0 "The Sparrows are not known for their economic expertise, and in this instance that is abundantly clear. The policy they have recently recommended to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has had widespread negative effects on the economy that were clearly beyond the expectations of the Sparrows. Stressed from attempting to deal with these consequences and from the mocking of their adversaries, the confidence of the Sparrows is wearing thin."
   flavour_mulen.17.a:0 "A costly mistake."

   flavour_mulen.18.d:0 "Though the Sparrows are composed of many skilled diplomats that are precise judges character and intent and have absolute control over their thoughts and words, this does not mean the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] they venerate possesses the same skills or demeanor. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to personally lead a diplomatic mission to [mulen_insult_target.GetName], and through her own lack of skill has damaged their view of us, with relations more strained than before."
   flavour_mulen.18.a:0 "Perhaps this misadenture can be washed away, but it will take effort."

   flavour_mulen.19.t:0 "The Sparrows: Outdated Military"
   flavour_mulen.19.d:0 "Old-fashioned noble matrons have been powerful members of the Sparrows since their inception, providing indispensable influence over Mulén's military through their inherited officer titles. But as a consequence, their traditionalism makes them slow or unwilling to adopt new military techniques, reducing Mulén's own capacity to fight."
   flavour_mulen.19.a:0 "Their lack of vision may cost us in blood."

   flavour_mulen.20.t:0 "The Sparrows: Restricting Trade"
   flavour_mulen.20.d:0 "The Sparrows have the upper hand against the Peacocks, and to keep it that way they have enticed the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] into severely restricting free trade. The Peacocks have begun to lose access to their amenities and the Merchant Matriarchs are losing a great deal of income - but so is Mulén. The Sparrows are not ignorant of the repercussions, and consider the damage to Muléni trade a necessary pain to be endured for the sake of keeping the Peacocks in line."

   flavour_mulen.22.t:0 "The Peacocks: Generous Donation"
   flavour_mulen.22.d:0 "The Merchant Matriarchs have sponsored many public works to attract more Peacock followers, but now have made a direct contribution to the Muléni treasury. The true intentions behind the gift remain unknown as they tied no strings as to how the funds should be spent. Many Sparrows are uneasy, and wonder if their rivals have done this because they already know and approve of how the government will allocate the funds, or if this is an acceptable investment to seize Sparrow attention, distracting from some other plot."
   flavour_mulen.22.a:0 "An act of goodwill. Surely."
   flavour_mulen.22.b:0 "Refuse their offering."

   flavour_mulen.23.t:0 "The Sparrows: Focus City"
   flavour_mulen.23.d:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decided that advancing the status of [mulen_focus_city_target.GetName] should be a priority, and is diverting state funds to assist. The Sparrows had drafted the plan after careful deliberation, and now gather officials, city planners, and social leaders to oversee and promote the expansion. Through this, the commonfolk shall talk of the magnanimity of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and her Sparrow supporters."
   flavour_mulen.23.a:0 "It is the mandate of the state to dispense competent service."
   flavour_mulen.23.b:0 "Cancel the plans and redivert the funds."

   flavour_mulen.24.t:0 "Integration of Verkal Gulan"
   flavour_mulen.24.d:0 "While receiving gold from our vassal Verkal Gulan has been useful, it has been decided to incorporate them into our holdings. This will mean we no longer receive a steady stream of income from them, and instead must rely upon the mines themselves. Only through careful management of relations between harpies and dwarves has this become possible, and this momentous occasion shall be widely celebrated. Though we now hold full governance, it's unlikely that many harpies will desire to venture far into the caverns."

The Mulén constitution of [GetYear] will resolve much of the problems with our previous arrangement and give stability to our country. In it, representatives of the Peacocks and the Sparrows will endorse the interests of their patrons, and make proposals for governance. While drafting this constitution, the Sparrows and the Peacocks engaged in bitter negotiations, but slowly points of contention were eventually resolved with compromise. Resentment and distrust still persists between the two factions, but with the establishment of the constitution they may be channeled into authorized institutions.

   flavour_mulen.31.t:0 "The Peacock and the Sparrow"
   flavour_mulen.31.d:0 "Since the early days of Siadanlén, the followers and descendants of Múla Swift-Sparrow have been guided by her vision. Mulén, the nation that bears her very name, rose from the sands and soared aloft on her philosophy to outstretch its wings and now spans from West to East. No harpy could possibly have a comparable legacy to Múla. Until now.\n\nBorn of a lowborn harpy and a Raheni merchant, a harpy daughter would take up her father's trade and be enriched with the expanding political and economic sphere of Mulén. Given the name \"Talon-Queen\" by her Ghankedheni family, Telarani did not wait for the ponderous advance of Mulén's diplomats and travelled far to make her own trade partners throughout Haless. She returned to the nation of her mother and claimed for herself the surname Golden-Peacock, for in all her spectacular adornments the most bedazzling were peacock feathers inlaid and expanded with gold leaf that were woven into her own plumage.\n\nOther harpies in Mulén had found themselves possessed of ever-increasing wealth and were beginning to form a cooperative power block. Telarani Golden-Peacock seized this nascent organization for herself, charming most, convincing many, and culling the rest. With Telarani at their head, these Merchant Matriarchs began to spread their influence throughout Muléni commerce and society, all sporting newly-acquired peacock feathers of their own. Many harpies of no standing flocked to them, seeking to emulate their success - Telarani's above all - and each of these \"Peacocks\" wore one feather themselves to express this aspiration.\n\nMany took notice of this rising force and were not enthralled. As Telarani and her allies frequently challenged the authority of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Mulén, a reactionary current arose comprising of those loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and to the legacy of Múla Swift-Sparrow that she embodied. Decrying the Peacocks and their Merchant Matriarchs as defaming the nation's philosophy of understanding to promote a philosophy of base avarice, the ranks of these \"Sparrows\" swelled with incensed nobles, administrators, and traditionalists.\n\nThough buoyed by the support of the Sparrows, the line of Múla found itself unable to stamp out the creeping reach of the Merchant Matriarchs and their Peacocks. The recent death of Telarani by uncertain means has sparked a new age of internal discord in Mulén, as the Peacocks and the Sparrows fight for political and cultural dominance."

   flavour_mulen.32.d:0 "Preparations were made all throughout Mulén for the month-long Land of the Skies celebration, with the largest festivities being centered around the hanging cities and the secondary ground-based cities near them. Visitors from everywhere between Lencenor and Yanshen have come, and the world's cuisine and crafts were prepared for all to enjoy. Traders, caravan leaders, and customers thronged the markets for goods and treasures and experiences that only Mulén could assemble. Foreign performers were brought in to display their skills, musicians and dancers and fire-eaters and so many more, but the true show would come from the Muléni harpies themselves. Their traditional songs echoed down the mountainsides. Aerial performers took flight with flowing banners and ribbons to entwine and unwind in luxurious patterns. Embedded glowing stones darted through the black skies among the stars as skilled night performers flew otherwise invisibly. In the background, countless small tales unfolded between harpies and their guests. Diplomatic and trade relations blossomed as envoys were dazzled. People down on their luck forsook their homelands to stay here in this Land of the Skies forever, perhaps entranced with the advances of one harpy they had met, or perhaps with the nation herself. The Merchant Matriarchs and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] herself were seen throughout the festivities, and the contest between the Peacocks and the Sparrows transformed into one-upmanship as each strived to outdo the other.\n\nThe ostentatious Peacocks sported their eponymous feathers, decorated wings, and precious ornaments as they flocked the streets to display their wealth and beauty. Their \"vulgar\" displays had frequently infuriated aloof traditionalists who decried the improper behavior of these \"Flappers\" as they were called, but the nights of these festivals put all others to shame.\n\nThe Sparrows were more drab by comparison and collected in behavior, but still sported colorful fashion drawn from the cultures of many nations. Using their personable demeanor, versed learning, and sharp wits, they sought out people of interest and appeal to engage in articulate conversation with, to see what all parties could offer one another.\n\nThroughout the days and nights of the festivities, the people offered countless voices and scents from the farthest reaches of Halcann up to the sky. Awestruck, the sky offered its own gentle whispering winds to carry these experiences aloft and outward. And upon those winds, radiant and magnificant Mulén would soar into the future."

The Peacocks were aggressive in negotiations, but I always felt that it was a pretense and that only token resistance was offered."\n\n\"Ah, you did seem more perceptive than your Sparrow colleagues. Look at me. What do you see?" Erreline turned to face her fully and held her arms open with wings slightly outstretched. Alkasa was uncertain what she meant, but took notice of the Merchant Matriarch's features and adornments. Her dress was a fine fabric of reds, purples, and yellows. Her blue wings, exhibiting inwoven peacock feathers of course, were painted with vibrant dyes that dazzled the younger harpy. Jewels fettered to gold bands and chains adorned her arms and neck, crowned by a circlet of blinding white metal.\n\n"I wear the Sardiphadin silks of Rahen. My wings sport the Triunic hues of Sinesadma. Alloyed gold and refined gems of the Dwarovar cling to me. Mithril frames my brow. I drink Endralliande tea from Semphrerongi porcelain cups. Bulwari dates pass my lips, paired with Baempes cheese and downed by Lorentish wine. I sit at a table of Lupulan teak and ancient Deepwoods lumber. My grandfather is a Desert Elf, my father was Ghankedheni, my favored husband is Haraf'ne. I am clad in this world! But I look ahead to the world to come.\n\n"A great dissolving wind shall come to put an end to this discord of empires, faiths, and cultures. There will be no Cannor, no Haless, no Mulén. There will only be one word and reason for words, one dynamic force of disintegration, transformation, and accumulation. That word is DESIRE! For a rare few - such as myself - blessed with not only wealth but also richness of desire, the world to come is already here. All others must subsist on lesser desires and meager fulfillments. We dilute this force with justifications, partaking in but not submitting to desire: the people in the world to come shall be wiser. There will be nothing else to submit to. This is the coming totality: a world held aloft on this powerful wind. What use is there in conflict with you Sparrows who will be swept away regardless of any effort on our part?\"\n\nAlkasa's shoulders were slumped and eyes wide with shock, but she considered these words and proffered some of her own. \"It is an interesting concept to say the least. But I think that in such a world, a state may unmoor itself from the earth and be swept high on the same winds - transformed into something invisible, omnipresent, and all-seeing. The dissolving of barriers between peoples: are these not the same conditions to establish rule? In that case, I think you may find that you all shall not soar alone as you hope, Erreline. We will follow.\""

Her brash and unrefined demeanor would seem out of place in Mulén but she is very familiar with local customs and could be useful in establishing initial rapports for our professional diplomats to expand upon.\n\nThe gnoll Vahko Coppertooth, who claims no kinship with the demon-worshiping gnolls Mulén has come to rule, and says he comes from another gnoll pack to the south. He has provided guardedly few details, perhaps suspicious of our intent, but his cunning wit and his connections to various shady figures in the region may prove to be unique assets.\n\nThe harimari Aimidewu of the Raging wind, who is of different cultural stock than the Royal Harimari of the Raj that we are familiar with. She styles herself as an adventurer-merchant, braving the wilds for a chance at exclusive deals. A kindred spirit to the enterprising Muléni harpies."
   flavour_mulen.34.a:0 "Hire the Nalénian Harpy guide."
   flavour_mulen.34.b:0 "Hire the Fieldstalker Gnoll guide."
   flavour_mulen.34.c:0 "Hire the Roaming Harimari guide."

   flavour_mulen.35.t:0 "The Land of the Rain Kings"
   flavour_mulen.35.d:0 "Our merchant-ambassadors and their guide have reported back from their long journey to Sarhal proper across the Gulf of Rahen. The regions of Dreksaret, Telekenid, Denibari, and Yetefesefi are all home to the Mengi people and their numerous kingdoms, remnants of an older united empire. They tell of their revered fallen king, a master of magic who had the presence and likeness of a dragon - or perhaps they had said he was a dragon? Likely this is just something lost in translation with our interpreters.\n\nTo their west lies a vast colorless swamp that is home to hordes of trolls, with whom the Mengi have waged an eternal war. At sky temple domes they beseech the aid of their god Amilak, who sends invigorating rains to ensure the prosperity of his children. The bounty derived from the rain flows along the great Keygas and Yet rivers, which terminate at the ports of Dakmender and Yetmesira respectively - bustling trade cities that oversee all outgoing trade."
   flavour_mulen.35.a:0 "Now we're aware of what we're up against."

   flavour_mulen.36.t:0 "Dakmender Deliberation"
   flavour_mulen.36.d:0 "The bustling port city of Dakmender sits at the mouth of the Keygas river, and through its watery gates have Raheni and Mengi goods long flowed. This Jewel of Telekenid was renowned for its trade in pearls, until the kingdom was economically subjugated and then annexed by Davharral, who promoted the expansion of the slave market to the exclusion of other trades.\n\nWith its pearl-laden shores now in our hands, we must decide: shall the kingdom of Dakmender be released as a protectorate to control their trade and internal politics once more, or shall Mulén establish its own trade company to manage these territories?"
   flavour_mulen.36.a:0 "Liberty shall buy their loyalty. Restore their kingdom."
   flavour_mulen.36.b:0 "Trade yearns to be free. Muléni merchants shall liberate it."

   flavour_mulen.37.t:0 "Excavation Assistance"
   flavour_mulen.37.d:0 "Harpies from the flock of Mulén have come bearing a proposal: they will bring in their own laborers, small beings called "goblins" from mountains too distant to see, and assist us in the ongoing excavation of the Kvangraak palace complex. In return, they request that we begin initial dialogues on opening a trade route between our two nations. Some are wary of allowing outsiders to enter the ruins, but the harpies have assured us that we will retain full salvage rights to anything found within."
   flavour_mulen.37.a:0 "Two hands dig twice as fast. Let them join."

   bulwar_flavour.105.da:0 "After the fall of Jaher's Empire, the Golden Highway that spanned from Bulwar to Haless in the far east rotted away. The section of the Highway coursing through the Salahad's milder northeastern climate suffered constant harpy raids and gnoll raiders controlled the western Harra oasis, forcing the caravans to adapt their routes by going right through the middle of the Salahad desert. The szal-Mehran, a reputed Mašnsih tribe living in the midst of the desert, established a prosperous trade route along the ruthless Salahad. Using strategic locations such as the port city of Edešukuru, their homelands in Shimlardu, and the safety of the walls of Azka-sur, these Mašnsih prospered as guides for the trade caravans who preferred to brave the Salahad.\n\nWith our newfound control over these key cities and our deal with the tribe, the Szal-Mehran are finding more and more success as guides along the Golden Highway, now that merchants no longer fear tax-happy patrols from differing states eager to impose a new tariff on their goods. The stability brought by our unification of the Szal-Mehran route has led to an influx of Raheni goods in [Root.Country.GetName], as many guides still remain, for the realignment of the Szal-Mehran to their new role is not complete. During this period of transition, we can still reap their benefits."
