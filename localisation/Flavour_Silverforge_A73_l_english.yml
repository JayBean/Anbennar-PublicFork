Due to his father’s influence among the cartels, Grun was able to study under visiting loremasters from Rubyhold, Ovdal Tungr, and even Marrhold throughout his late 20s and 30s. These opportunities were not wasted on the young Grun as he proved to have a prodigious memory. Soon into his adulthood, he became a master of hold studies, inventing sophisticated pulley systems to further aid the hold construction in Anvilwright, slow as progress was. To that end, he was also the originator of the surface mine prototypes outside of Silverforge Hall.\n\nNow, he has come before $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ with a rare collection of artifacts, an assortment of firearm pieces allegedly dating to the Last Days of the Dwarovar. He holds up a barrel to reveal the spiral engraving along the inside, claiming to be able to reproduce this pattern and that it would increase the accuracy of our own weapons. While it is not clear what he is basing this claim on, having such a prestigious individual among the court would increase the political standing of the republic."
silverforge.1.a:0 "Give him the resources to tinker and see what he comes up with."
silverforge.2.t:0 "Opportunities from the Orc Trade"
silverforge.2.d:0 "Orcs have long been the enemies of dwarven civilization. Though the loremasters claim they were but one factor in the Last Days of Dwarovar, they wrested control of the Serpentspine from the dwarves and barred us from our home even so. Following the loss of the Serpentspine, orcs had only made the rare raid into the open air of Escann. While these threats never amounted to much, the dwarves knew of their potential should they ever rally in large enough numbers. This came to pass in 1424, when the Dookanson led the Greentide in a flood over Escann. The orcish army destroyed the successor states of Castanor and nearly reached the Havoral Divide, until the Greentide Vanguard was routed at the Battle of Rottenstep. If not for that victory, and the Marcher Lords' subsequent heroism, Silverforge would have been helpless to defend the Empire, its army all-but-shattered by the end of the 4th Lilac War.\n\nBut now, we have rebuilt our army and improved upon its composition. We have expanded our territory to encompass the duchy of High Esmar, and with the discovery that Aelantir is once again inhabitable, orc prisoners of war are being transported through our lands. It is believed that these prisoners will make valuable slaves in the newly forming colonies.\n\nHowever, this might be the opportunity we have been waiting for. With the increased size of our realm, and an ample supply of labor, we might be able to complete the mining project proposed by Strongbellow. The land survey has already been commissioned. We shall purchase our own slaves and put them to work as debt laborers to pay for their crimes against our first home in Aul-Dwarov and our second home in Escann."
silverforge.2.a:0 "May they never again threaten our third home in the Havoral Divide."
silverforge.3.t:0 "Rising Dwarven Power"
silverforge.3.d:0 "The political tides change swiftly within the Empire and we have done well to avoid the squabbles of pretenders and claimants, as we remained neutral during the 4th Lilac War. Still, neutrality can be a rare luxury at times of war, especially with troops at the city gates.\n\nNow, the tides have turned again with the election of a new Emperor and Silverforge’s expansionist mining policies. They have even petitioned the Emperor to resolve their supposed claim to our countryside beyond the city limits. We are no enemies of the dwarves and know they would not attack a Free City. Perhaps it is time though to align ourselves with this rising power..."
silverforge.3.a:0 "The dwarven Elector will help us to promote gnomish interests within the Empire."
silverforge.3.b:0 "No, we must maintain our autonomy as a Free City."
silverforge.4.t:0 "A Delegate of Investors"
silverforge.4.d:0 "Silverforge has invested greatly in Esmari trade in an attempt to obtain the necessary resources to complete their hold, even expanding their territory to directly control many local trade centers. In some regards, we have managed to profit from this as an important trading city ourselves. Still, we are very much on the outside looking in, and we would be better off integrating more fully into this new market.\n\nThis opportunity seems to have arrived along with delegates from the unfinished hold. They propose a large investment in our markets to ensure their growth and integration with their local hegemony. We would still pay taxes to the Emperor as per our role as a Free City, but in exchange they ask that we come to their aid in their military endeavors."
silverforge.4.a:0 "We accept this generous offer."
silverforge.4.b:0 "We would never agree to such terms!"
silverforge.5.t:0 "Digging Ourselves into a Hole"
silverforge.5.d:0 "It has been known for nearly a millennium in Silverforge that the Havoral Divide does not have sufficient resources to construct a dwarven hold. Though the iron deposits within our realm are vast, they are not limitless, and our prospector-mages informed us long ago that we would have stripped our mines bare before collecting a quarter of the materials required.\n\nInstead, we have had to content ourselves with smithing. This is no low art of course, but it cannot compare to the multi-generational masterwork of a hold. There is no greater gift for the future, no more selfless act, than committing one’s life to a project that will not benefit them, yet would benefit countless generations to come. We are no halflings who sit in a hole and call it home. Yet here we are, no better.\n\nIt was in 1412 that a young Grun Strongbellow laid plans for a new type of mine, suggesting that while the terrain of Esmaria was not as resource rich as the mountains, a sufficiently large digging operation might provide us with the necessary material to complete our hold. Prototype mines were soon built outside Silverforge Hall, but the operation was halted as we rose to the aid of Adenn Skylance. It was believed that the war would be won, then we would complete our hold. Neither came true.\n\nAs Esmaria was flanked by Ibevar and Arbaran, our troops were overextended, caught in the East Dameshead, and wiped out by Lorentish Cavalry. With the end of the war, we returned to our mines, but Strongbellow had over-estimated the material return of the mines due to faulty prospecting. Even with this novel technique, Silverforge would require a mining army of Imperial quantity for such an operation to succeed."
silverforge.5.a:0 "From bad to worse..."
silverforge.6.t:0 "Sevrund's Band Sets Out"
silverforge.6.d:0 "'There are two kinds of Silver Dwarves. One is loyal to our history and hardship in the Havoral Divide. The other simply lives here. The annals of Silverforge Hall run replete with the history of our nation and of the Silver Dwarven people. From the fall of the tribal kingdom of the Havorics, to the fall of Great Cardest, to the fall of even greater Castanor, Silverforge has outlasted them all. We have seen eruptions, dragons, great curses and wars and wars and wars.'\n-From "A History of the Surface Dwarves in Cannor", Grun Strongbellow, Konwell University Press, 1563\n\nFirst, there was a green tide that washed over Escann from the east. Now it ebbs, and a new tide flows from the west as adventurers from across the known world seek fortune and glory from within the emptied Serpentspine. The dwarves of Silverforge, unlike most, no longer feel the call of Aul-Dwarov. Still, we are only a minority of the Silver Dwarves of East Dameria and Silverforge Hall has become a popular setting-off point for dwarven bands headed for the holds of old. Perhaps encouraged by this, many of our younger dwarves have begun to set out as well, for nothing more than the excitement of adventure. To end this tide of our own, we have started to issue adventuring licenses for our citizens, limiting them to the battlefields of Escann where they might do good to rebuild what Balgar once built and eventually return to our realm as the next generation of great clan leaders. One such youth is Sevrund Ironhearth.\n\nThough not yet an adult at 37, Sevrund is charismatic with a gaze as heavy and sudden as a hammer strike. He has quickly gathered a band of a few hundred to his name and swears to personally slay an orc for each of them and every dwarf yet to join. A proud dwarf by any measure!"
silverforge.6.a:0 "May he prove himself worthy of our pride too."
silverforge.7.t:0 "Sevrund's Band Returns"
silverforge.7.d:0 "Within the past few weeks, we have been receiving couriers that tell of a dwarven adventuring band on its way to Silverforge Hall. This would not be a surprise given that the occasional band still sets out for the Serpentspine even now despite the initial rush having ended around the beginning of the 15th century. However, this band was not headed towards Escann, but from it. Then only a few days ago, a courier arrived from the band itself revealing them to be none other than Sevrund’s band, having set out a century prior. The bulk of the band arrived today with Sevrund himself now a strong but aged dwarf of 137.\n\nHis hair is unbraided and cut short, unusual for a Silver Dwarf. He is unarmed but wears fine Silverforge plate armor, undented as a show of prestige despite the many scars beneath. This would not have been his battle armor. As the $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ walks out to welcome Sevrund in person, he is met with that unmistakable gaze, as Sevrund shouts out that 100 years is too long away from his true home. They embrace as $MONARCH$ tells of the many stories Silverforge had heard of the “The Young Blood Band.” “Only half true, and the wrong half at that!” Sevrund bellows in laughter. What’s more he tells that the remainder of his band is slowly transporting a large number of orc prisoners of war to our realm."
silverforge.7.a:0 "More soldiers for the army and laborers for the mines!"
silverforge.8.t:0 "The Future of the Republic"
silverforge.8.d:0 "We cannot only rely on trade if we are ever going to collect the materials to complete our hold. We should look for means to expand our territory as well as our administration, so that we might pursue Strongbellow’s revised plans. This will require founding a new cartel to oversee the mining process as most current administration is overseeing hold construction and our Electorship within Imperial politics. We would still need to increase our workforce severalfold as well, but perhaps the locals could be convinced to aid the mining effort if we have no other option. Any progress is progress.\n\nYet, the question has been raised of how to handle our current cartels? They could see this as a power play to limit their influence to within our hold territory. We could encourage their practices in an attempt to pacify their concerns. However, this could lead to them interfering with organizing the new cartel. If, instead, we were strict in limiting their potential interference, this could cause instability in our realm."
silverforge.8.a:0 "We should encourage the cartels."
silverforge.8.b:0 "The cartels already have too much power."
silverforge.9.t:0 "The Future of the Republic"
silverforge.9.d:0 "We now hold Wexhills along with Bal Hyl at its center. Never again shall the Alenic Barbarians of House síl Wex rise above their status as dukes. As a minority Elector, we must hold the final blow or risk consequences for the Silver and Ruby Dwarves within the Empire who we represent. Still, it is enough to have taken the center of Wex’s power to prevent any further machinations they might have planned. Their poor rule, combined with the loss of their core territory, will ensure that no other realm will respect their position moving forward. Now, it is up to us to convince the Empire through our show of mercy and steady rule that our claim to Wexhills is righteous.\n\nThis has been with some difficulty, however, given that our neighbors have generally frowned upon our mining practices, with some even petitioning the Emperor to cease the operation. The Carver Cartel has taken the most offence to this, since it is a direct threat to their responsibilities as well as their power base. It can be difficult to keep the various cartels of our realm in line at times, but the Carvers especially. It seems that every day, more dwarves are joining in pursuit of their own ambitions.\n\nIt has not gone unnoticed that the current $MONARCHTITLE$ is a member of the Carvers as well as most of their top advisors. Perhaps $MONARCH$ should work to limit the influence of the cartels, before they become a legitimate threat to our standing within the Empire."
silverforge.9.a:0 "We should encourage the cartels."
silverforge.9.b:0 "The cartels already have too much power."
silverforge.10.t:0 "The Future of the Republic"
silverforge.10.d:0 "Our recent conquests have brought opportunities to Silverforge which we haven’t seen since before the founding of our hold. Once again, we hold Adstanad or ‘Oldpassage’ as it is referred to now and the tunnels leading to the Forlorn Vale. With a large population of Elves under our rule, we can begin investing in the elven goods trade. Ibevar has long been the leading cultural center for elven stylings due to their size and independent status. While we have certainly seen to cut down on their size, their artisans and merchants will still hold great sway, so long as we do not discourage the practice.\n\nAgain though, the cartel leaders have been elbowing each other out of the way to discuss dealings with $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. It has not helped matters that the $MONARCHTITLE$ is also a member of the Carver Cartel, further raising anxiety among the rest and causing them to ask for increased privileges to balance the power of individual cartels within the realm. It would be wise to assuage their fears, but at the same time the cartels have been gaining influence within the country across the board recently, not to mention the Carver’s disproportionate influence due to the size of their responsibilities…"

silverforge.11.t:0 "Bal Hyl Ceremony"
silverforge.11.d:0 "Bal Hyl High Temple is a marvel of modern engineering. The citadel itself features a double moat, one surrounding the outer wall and another for the inner keep. The grounds have two barracks, a small training field, a series of officer and engineering quarters, an administrative building, the keep, and the high temple. From the administration lies a large rectangular courtyard with a series of pointed-arch arcades with barrel-vaulted ceilings, leading to three pairs of doors at the far end that give way to Bal Hyl High Temple. These doors open into an indoor balcony above a vast cavern of a room extending far ahead, but also deep into the ground, the walls flanked by pillars as wide as three dwarves abreast, descending into the depths below. The pillars are each supported by a flying buttress extending towards the center of the room and down along the closest set of pillars run circular staircases leading to the floor. At the bottom there is a long ceremonial room lit by the great stone and glasswork dome at the center of the ceiling. Every so often along the wall is an iron door with brass filigree, leading to back rooms and tunnels far into the depths of Wexhills.\n\nThe stochastic rhythm of dozens of smiths can faintly be heard echoing off the walls. That is until the sound of hurried footsteps begins to fill the great room as dwarves bring silverglass mirrors and candle-lit lanterns to illuminate the far corners. A symphony company from Seinathil begins to set up beneath a tapestry of the Emperor. Soon after, the guests arrive from all across the Empire, in dress varying from Lorentish gowns and flowered chest pieces, to the Havoric high fashion that has so recently taken to Esmaria, to the masquerading styles of the Corvurians — without the masks. But none compare to Emperor $EMPERORNAME$ who wears a mix of Lorentish and Havoric stylings with a simple chest piece, voluminous epaulettes flowing into wrist cuffs, and a fur shortcape with gold embroidering.\n\nThe ceremony sees members of almost every major House in the Empire pass through the halls and courtyards of the grand temple, even some of síl Wex and cadet branches. Politics can have a selective memory, both for the better and for the worse. For over 100 years the Empire was wracked by the Lilac Wars. Now, 200 years gone, what remains of those tragedies? Dwarves can hold long grudges, but only a handful of dwarves today were alive then, and they were only children. Now, we stand atop Wexhills, but do we truly stand taller than House síl Wex?"
silverforge.11.a:0 "One day this will be history too..."
silverforge.20.t:0 "The Delegation of Privileges"
silverforge.20.d:0 "So far, the Carver Cartel has managed our mining operation with little integration to the rest of our government. They elect their own cartel leadership, resolve disputes, and collect their own taxes. Meanwhile, the government in Silverforge oversees the other cartels, the administration and completion of the hold, as well as all international affairs. This division of responsibilities has led to increasing inefficiency, however. The authority to mint coins is strictly regulated from Silverforge Hall, yet most exchanges now see currency leaving our realm for mining supplies. Trade relations can only be established by license from Anvilwright, yet the trade routes must be negotiated with respect to the surface mines. Daily, requests come in from the Carvers for new mining equipment, such that most of the armory cartels must put their primary work on hold, to forge these new tools en masse. Then there are the orcs… \n\nIndustrious to a fault, but haughty and stubborn, the orcs put to work in the mines are a constant source of tension. Occasionally, there is unrest within Silverforge Hall over the potential threat the orcs could present if they ever revolted on a large scale. Though the Carvers have never had difficulty keeping the orcs in line and in mine, the lack of interaction between Carver day-to-day operations and the average dwarf in the hold must be resolved to ensure the stability of our realm. The Carver Cartel must be further integrated into our administration. This will of course mean a trade in power: they will lose some authority over the running of the surface mines, while we will lose some authority over the other cartels and administrative divisions. The only question is how much we should give and where to ensure efficiency."

While most internal affairs are split between the Carver Cartel and the elected clan government of the hold, the Cartel still reports to $MONARCH$ in weekly briefings and their authority over the surface mines dervies from the $MONARCHTITLE$. In practice, these briefings often lack key details of their operation and our neighbors inform us of the occasional incursion of dwarven miners into their legal territory. If this were not bad enough, the head of the Carver Cartel has sent a delegate to the $MONARCHTITLE$ demanding more autonomy in their own affairs."
