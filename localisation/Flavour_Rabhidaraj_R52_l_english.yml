 R52_claws_extended_title:0 "Claws Extended"
 R52_claws_extended_desc:0 "The tiger must know when to extend or retract its claws if it is to survive in the jungle. This lesson has not been lost on the Harimraj, nor shall it be with us. There is a time to strike, and a time to bide. It is now the former."

 R52_finish_our_meal_title:0 "Finish Our Meal"
 R52_finish_our_meal_desc:0 "Years ago, the Grand Vizier Manava acquired the province of Nabukh from the Prahbi of Saddathar. The weakened rump state left behind poses a substantial security risk to the Raj as it is unable to defend the eastern flank of the Raja's Vajiya holdings. It will be best if we consolidate the region ourselves - for the good of the Harimraj, of course."

 R52_the_farmer_and_the_herdsman_title:0 "Farmer and Herdsman"
 R52_the_farmer_and_the_herdsman_desc:0 "The great textile centers in Vajiya are supplied by vast cotton fields to its west, currently controlled by the Prabhi of Setapsim. These fields, vital as they are, are unfortuantely highly vulnerable to raids from the Raghamadeshi and illegal grazing by the Tudhina. It is crucial that we safeguard the supply chain for this critical imperial revenue stream."

 R52_a_reliable_partner_title:0 "A Reliable Partner"
 R52_a_reliable_partner_desc:0 "Our efforts in recent years have consolidated and secured the Dhenbasana basin and placed the Raj in its most secure position since the peaceful days of Shurapalar the Radiant. Our power and loyalty is well noticed by the Raja and should be appropriately honored - and what better way to celebrate this partnership than a party?"

 R52_investigate_disloyalty_title:0 "Investigate Disloyalty"
 R52_investigate_disloyalty_desc:0 "Unfortunately, few of the Raja's subjects share our spirit of devotion and service. The rot that began under Golpalar the Scholar has grown unabated and threatens to kill the Raj if we do not act decisively. We must know of plots against the Lotus Throne before they happen - so we must improve the keenness of our eyes and ears. Soon we will know thoughts of treason and rebellion before they are even spoken aloud by the disloyal."

 R52_challenge_the_courts_title:0 "Challenge the Courts"
 R52_challenge_the_courts_desc:0 "We have assembled considerable evidence of insufficient loyalty and improprietous against the Raja amongst the courts of the realm. Laying out the case against this spirit of casual treason will ruffle some fur, but it cannot be allowed to fester."

 R52_illuminate_the_raj_title:0 "Illuminate the Raj"
 R52_illuminate_the_raj_desc:0 "Our foes accused us of self-dealing and fabricating evidence, but in time our program has revealed the presence of enemies of the state at all levels of society. We have been proven right -- and the Raj is safer for it."

 R52_a_beacon_of_light_title:0 "A Beacon of Light"
 R52_a_beacon_of_light_desc:0 "All now look to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for guidance and moral leadership, and even our foes recognize the incomparable weight of our Vizierate's authority. Our ceaseless efforts have banished the Raj's age of darkness and restored light to the realm."

 R52_the_eastern_fields_title:0 "The Eastern Fields"
 R52_the_eastern_fields_desc:0 "East of Rabhidaraj lies the agrarian region of Satarsaya. This broad plain of horsemasters and cotton fields is divided up between squabbling landlords and corrupt administrators. Once storied cavalrymen and industrious laborers, now the Satarsaya Prahbia are little more than overreaching bandits, fallen into the common corruption of our society,  failing the people. We must move into the Satarsaya, throw out these unrighteous lords, and restore the plains to a state of order and justice as an example to the realm."

 R52_secure_the_supply_chain_title:0 "Secure the Supply Chain"
 R52_secure_the_supply_chain_desc:0 "The cotton fields of Inner Rahen supply the paper mills of Dhenijansar, creating the famous cotton paper that has become synonymous with the Raja's administrators and ministries. As it is so vital to the proper functioning of the state apparatus, it is only sensible to ensure these fields are directly controlled by the central government. As the only trustworthy parts of the central government are loyal to the Vizier, it is only sensible that they be controlled by us."

 R52_one_raj_one_vizier_title:0 "One Raj, One Vizier"
 R52_one_raj_one_vizier_desc:0 "Prior to the ascension of Grand Vizier Manava, it was the Senapti of Amtujsaat that historically held the Raj's highest office. Though once great, the Goldenpaw clan forgot the responsibility of righteous rule, and under their leadership the Raj decayed into its present state of decadent rot. Even now, scores of corrupt officials and noblemen yearn for the return of the Amtujsaat Vizierate. For the good of the Raj, we must crush them and ensure that the scions of Goshar Goldenpaw offer no alternative center of power for traitors to rally around."

 R52_codes_of_the_sun_title:0 "Codes of the Sun"
 R52_codes_of_the_sun_desc:0 "Others mock the Radiant Sun school for its uncompromising moralism, but this is only because they have grown accustomed to the horrible decadence that Rahen has sunk into of late. The philosophers of late have not yet experienced what it means to live in a society of just people - but we can change that. The use of the Vizierate's authority can be used to promulgate new moral laws and encourage the formation of a virtuous citizenry - this will be a key plank in our plan to restore the glory of Harimar's empire."

 R52_warriors_of_light_title:0 "Warriors of Light"
 R52_warriors_of_light_desc:0 "As part of our moral reform regime, we have instituted a strict but fair system of military justice. While other armies loot and pillage their way across the countryside, those flying the banner of the Bloody Claw know they fight for order and righteousness. A soldier of such virtue will always face the battle with more determination than one who fights for mere self-interest."

 R52_knife_in_the_dark_title:0 "A Knife in the Dark"
 R52_knife_in_the_dark_desc:0 "Our transformation of the Raj is nearly complete -- but it seems that even as we build a more moral society in the countryside, the halls of power are yet haunted by decadence and self-dealing. Despite all of our efforts to reform the legal system, to root out corruption, there is one final stain that keeps the Lotus Throne imperfect - The Raja. No matter how we have strained, the Rajas have never joined our crusade against corruption with as much vigor or belief as we. Can we ever hope to finish our reforms when we wear only the Red Turban of the Vizierate? When the Lotus Court itself is kept ever in the shadow? Surely... surely the greater good justifies the smaller evil of seizing control?"

 R52_lay_the_bait_title:0 "Lay the Bait"
 R52_lay_the_bait_desc:0 "Simply sniffing around and attempting to catch the trail of traitors and criminals cannot possibly deal with a problem the size of the one facing the Raj today. We must actively lure them out with the promise of a fantastically lucrative yet highly illegal bargain. By spreading rumors that the Vizier's brother is open to bribery, the snakes will swarm from the shadows to seek a way into wealth and power - and we will slam the trap shut as soon as they show their treacherous tongues."

 R52_cleanse_the_filth_title:0 "Cleanse the Filth"
 R52_cleanse_the_filth_desc:0 "Our scheme has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. The band of criminals we captured was just the start -- our determined investigators have compelled these cretins into revealing their contacts across local high society. It is time to begin the arrests of the leeches who sap the lifeblood of Rahen."

 R52_light_the_shadows_title:0 "Light the Shadows"
 R52_light_the_shadows_desc:0 "As we suspected, the rot reaches ever higher. While it is horrifying to learn from the confessions of disgraced noble leaders that they were directly aided by those among the Senaptia, it is gratifying to get closer and closer to ripping the corruption out by its roots."

 R52_begin_the_cleansing_title:0 "Begin the Cleansing"
 R52_begin_the_cleansing_desc:0 "The ministries were once a beacon of meritocracy and justice. In the days when they were truly institutions of merit and order, the administrative state worked for the good of the realm, and the needs of all of the castes were met. Now, however, it has become infected with parasites and the indolent scions of decadent houses. The lower castes are left without direction or aid, the middle castes are unpatronized, and the high castes find no reward for moral behavior. We must remove the termites that feast on the ministries before the whole structure comes crumbling down and we descend into anarchy."

 R52_behold_the_dawn_title:0 "Behold the Dawn"
 R52_behold_the_dawn_desc:0 "Our program of ministerial reform was derided as reckless and needlessly inflammatory, but even the skeptics are taken aback by how remarkably effective the civil service has become after we purged it of its leeches. The people are again supported, able to pursue their callings and destinies, and the improved efficiency of the ministries has done much for the coffers and reputation of the Raja."

 R52_a_viziers_lament_title:0 "A Vizier's Lament"
 R52_a_viziers_lament_desc:0 "Our school, the Radiant Sun, has always seen sinfulness and hypocrisy in the courts of the Raj. However, the full scale of this wretched enterprise only became clear to Manava of the Bloody Claw after his ascension to the Vizierate. Perhaps the Raja merely needs to be shown that a better world is possible?"

 R52_traveling_poets_title:0 "Traveling Poets"
 R52_traveling_poets_desc:0 "Our mission to transform society will require persuading the common people that they have a key role to play in building a nation of virtue. The lower castes are the builders, farmers, and sailors - the base on which all the splendor of Rahen has been built. They may have become discouraged and forgotten their incredible importance during the decades of corruption, but we must remind them of their own nobility. We shall dispatch traveling poets to bring our message to the masses through their beautiful verse, inspiring the people and restoring their belief in themselves."

 R52_seven_tales_of_rot_title:0 "Seven Tales of Rot"
 R52_seven_tales_of_rot_desc:0 "The 'tale of rot' is an emerging literary genre created by our cadre of traveling poets. In it, they detail the lurid stories of corruption and decadence they have observed and castigate the upper class for failing to prevent it. Now, a group of scholars has edited a collection of seven of these tales, and they have grown popular among moralists of all castes. We should ensure the widespread circulation of these tomes."

 R52_scholars_of_radiance_title:0 "Scholars of Radiance"
 R52_scholars_of_radiance_desc:0 "As a relatively new branch of High Philosophy, the Radiant Sun has not historically enjoyed the scale and breadth of academic discourse as the other schools. We can correct this by establishing a central hub from which the scholars of radiance can work toward perceiving ever closer approximations of true righteousness."

 R52_the_colorbound_tomes_title:0 "Colorbound Tomes"
 R52_the_colorbound_tomes_desc:0 "The close link between the scholars of the Radiant Sun and our own rising power in the Raj has reinvigorated our school, filling our brightest minds with the sense of possibility that comes only from proximity to power. The so-called 'colorbound tomes' are the bound codices of foundational writings that have come out of Parusapa in recent years, notable for the vibrant, bright covers created with the city's famous dyes. We can ensure these tomes begin to circulate in the wider philosophical reading circles, spreading  the Radiant Sun further throughout Rahen."

 R52_the_solar_altar_title:0 "The Solar Altar"
 R52_the_solar_altar_desc:0 "The Radiant Sun was formed when the scholars of the High Philosophy were exposed to Bulwari theology following Jaher's conquest. Though we do not in any way disavow the great contributions of our ancestors or their search for the righteous path of the High Gods, the people need a living, breathing god to bind them together. Let them turn to Surael, last living god, whose brilliant radiance casts away the shadow and turns the focus of all to the path of righteousness."

 R52_parusapa_conclave_title:0 "Parusapa Conclave"
 R52_parusapa_conclave_desc:0 "There can be no doubt that our reforms have brought considerable religious upheaval, a regrettable byproduct of necessary change. Nevertheless, the time has come to provide a clear and stable path forward. We should summon the brightest minds of both Bulwari theology and Raheni philosophy together to discuss and debate the matters at hand."

 R52_patronize_commentaries_title:0 "Patronize Commentaries"
 R52_patronize_commentaries_desc:0 "The Bloody Claw watches the scholars of the Radiant Sun carefully for those who show signs of promising, innovative thought. We should uplift these key individuals and provide them the resources they need to continue producing their work."

 R52_a_most_delicate_art_title:0 "A Most Delicate Art"
 R52_a_most_delicate_art_desc:0 "Dyemaking, known in Parusapa as 'the delicate art', requires not just competence and dexterity, but also patience and calmness of mind. In this way, it is an industry that by its very nature rewards virtue - a fitting backbone for Rabhidaraj's fiscal future. The greatest limitation on growing the industry is simply that there is not enough demand for dyes, but control of cotton and the resulting textiles should solve that problem."

 R52_parade_in_black_and_red_title:0 "Parade in Black and Red"
 R52_parade_in_black_and_red_desc:0 "The uniforms of the Bloody Claw cut a striking figure, the brilliant black and red dyes serving as a stunning advertisement both of our martial prowess and of our precious goods. Why build such a beautiful army if you aren't going to show it off?"

 R52_ravinandan_method_title:0 "Ravinandan Method"
 R52_ravinandan_method_desc:0 "Ravinandan was a Parusapa dyemaster and a contemporary of Grand Vizier Manava who created a vastly improved method of coloring paper. Suddenly, the creation of ornate and intricate illustrations was both more affordable and much more appealing. This method has been slowly percolating through the industry in local circles, but with our direct intervention, the surging demand for our products would bring great wealth to both Rabhidaraj and the Raja."

 R52_resplendent_finery_title:0 "Resplendent Finery"
 R52_resplendent_finery_desc:0 "Though the innovations in paper dyeing have proven to be the most economically profound, it is the way the imperial clothiers have improved the process of dyeing cloth that allows our dignitaries to so easily outshine those of other courts at every function."
 #Events:
 rabhidaraj_events.1.t:0 "Lord of the Feast"
 rabhidaraj_events.1.d:0 "Every few years the Tudhinai hold a grand feast to celebrate the relationship between Raja and Prabhi, a tradition which goes back all the way to the conquests of Harimar. Some feared that we would end this long tradition now that we are the rightful overlords of the Tudhinai shepherds.\n\nThey need not have worried. A feast which serves a virtuous purpose, like binding together the Raja and his subjects, is not an unacceptable or sinful frivolity like many of the grand parties and feasts of the empire. Instead, we have chosen to celebrate and highlight our partnership with the Raja by turning this year's feast into the grandest that ever was. At that feast, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was publicly thanked by the Raja for his loyal and useful service, which has restored imperial power to its highest point in many years."
 rabhidaraj_events.1.a:0 "Enjoy, in celebration of the realm!"

 rabhidaraj_events.2.t:0 "Lamentation Before the Sun"
 rabhidaraj_events.2.d:0 "'Every morning my shame rises with you\nFor I know we have soiled your eyes'\n     -excerpt from the Lamentation Before the Sun\n\nLast year, a mysterious epic known as the Lamentation Before the Sun began a circuit of performances among the Parusapa nobility, decrying the state of the empire and how its officials have looted the common people while ignoring their cries for order and safety. The other Prabhia and Senaptia have reacted with incredulity, demanding an investigation into the identity of the author so they might be punished for treason.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has instead defended the piece, inviting the Raja to a performance at the court in Parusapa. After the performance, the tears in the emperor's eyes confirmed that they, too, understood what had become of Harimar's legacy. The two spent the long hours of the night lamenting the state of the empire before swearing to one another that they would purge corrupt elements, heal institutions, and restore the glory of the Harimraj."
 rabhidaraj_events.2.a:0 "At last, the Raja sees the light!"

 rabhidaraj_events.3.t:0 "The Setapsim Affair"
 rabhidaraj_events.3.d:0 "The Raja and [Root.Monarch.GetName] were in Setapsim evaluating the progress of the cotton harvest that was bound for Vajiya when they were assaulted by a team of assassins! Though these brigands struck swiftly and dishonorably from the shadows, they were shocked by our ferocity and the power of our response -the Vizier personally slew three of the assassins in defense of the Raja, and the rest were quickly cut down or captured by Bloody Claw and Lotus Claw bannermen.\n\nThough some claim the attack to be suspicious and politically convenient for our faction, we know that it is little surprise that the forces of evil would conduct themselves this way. Fortunately, the incapable assailants have left behind ample evidence of the involvement of enemies of the Vizier, and our investigation has convinced the Raja of our enemies' guilt. Perhaps the rest of the empire will come to believe us in due time."
 rabhidaraj_events.3.a:0 "His opinion is all that matters."

 rabhidaraj_events.4.t:0 "Parusapa Moralism"
 rabhidaraj_events.4.d:0 "Parusapa Moralism was a theological-political movement that began in the city of Parusapa in the early 15th century, most commonly associated with the Radiant Sun school of the High Philosophy. While the Rabhidaraj Vizierate was never formally associated with the movement, large amounts of correspondence between its foremost thinkers and the Grand Vizier Manava have been discovered, suggesting that the local authorities were deeply sympathetic to the movement.\n\nIn general, Parusapa Moralism revolved around the belief that the primary purpose of the state was to construct a society in which people would be reshaped into virtuous citizens. It made the further claim that a successful society and a virtuous public were nearly synonymous, with the mere achievement of material prosperity or martial dominance being nothing more than hollow vanities. The movement was broadly critical of many trends in contemporary Raheni society and attracted a wide array of enemies and critics. Though the movement's most ardent supporters could be found among relatively well-educated harimari who had nevertheless found themselves on the wrong side of the established social order, it was the official protection of the Rabhidaraj Vizierate that ensured the continued public force of the movement. As a result, the movement's fortunes were largely tied to those of the Bloody Claw Dynasty."
 rabhidaraj_events.4.a:0 "An idea is the most powerful force."

 rabhidaraj_events.5.t:0 "The Cult of Surael"
 rabhidaraj_events.5.d:0 "When the worship of Surael was imported into Rahen by the Rabhidaraj Vizierate and their allies in the Radiant Sun school, some feared that it would result in a wholesale adoption of Bulwari religion. However, the new 'Cult of Surael' did not go quite that far. Instead, they used Surael as a personification and focal point for their values of a stable and prosperous society.\n\nMost art from the early Suraelist era included one of three depictions of the god. The first portrayed him as an aging patriarch whose manner toward his children was equal parts firmness and compassion. In the second, Surael was a valiant warrior protecting the weak and defenseless from hordes of adversaries. In the final depiction, Surael was shown as a great wizard and intellectual, capable of fantastic feats of both magical and mental prowess.  However, only one depiction would dominate later in the Suraelist period."
 rabhidaraj_events.5.a:0 "Surael the Father"
 rabhidaraj_events.5.b:0 "Surael the Warrior"
 rabhidaraj_events.5.c:0 "Surael the Wise"

 rabhidaraj_events.6.t:0 "The Parusapa Conclave"
 rabhidaraj_events.6.d:0 "More than a hundred dignitaries, and thousands of their attendants, have descended on Parusapa in the last few weeks. The question put before them was simple -- what should the theological future of Rabhidaraj be? Of course, all in attendance know that at stake is not merely the personal religious beliefs of a handful of Bloody Claw elites, but also the religious leanings of the entire Harimraj. Each day, the mood in the meeting room seems to be even more tense than the day before. It is clear that no single compromise will be reached, and instead the attendees have gravitated toward three possible solutions.\n\nThe first set of delegates preach a wholesale conversion to the Jadd, pointing out the obvious similarities between its teachings and the beliefs of the Radiant Sun school's Moralist movement. The second counsel a more moderate approach, syncretizing many aspects of the various Suraelist sects with reverence for the High Gods and the old philosophies, giving Surael a new place as lord of the High Gods. The final group, including most prominently the delegates from Rahen itself, have begun pushing the idea that the Radiant Sun school should treat Surael as a useful personification of the righteous path they truly worship, realigning itself with the High Philosophy and securing its place as the most prominent of all the schools. The impasse will only be broken when [Root.Monarch.GetName] makes a decision."
 rabhidaraj_events.6.a:0 "The Jadd rings of truth."
 rabhidaraj_events.6.b:0 "Further integrate worship of Surael."
 rabhidaraj_events.6.c:0 "We are stewards of the High Philosophy."
