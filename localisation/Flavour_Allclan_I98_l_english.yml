 # MISSIONS
 I98_begin_the_frenzy_title:0 "Begin the Frenzy"
 I98_begin_the_frenzy_desc:0 "Hammers enrapture one's senses; clanging rattles the bones: the enamoring sounds of industry. The Glorious Erectors could heed no greater calling, for the Frenzy has begun. Hide the children. Cover your ears. Plug your nose. Our days shall be filled with a bustling cacophony of nonsense for the foreseeable future. Hygiene shall be ignored. Food shall only be consumed for the purpose of continuing the Frenzy. No plot of land shall remain barren by the time we're done."
 I98_rabid_constructions_title:0 "Rapid Constructions"
 I98_rabid_constructions_desc:0 "Faster. Taller. Put a sculpture of [Root.Monarch.GetName] over there. Level that apartment complex and build another apartment complex on top of the rubble. I want seventeen separate taverns on main street. I didn't ask for complaints, I asked for progress."
 I98_delirium_of_the_hammer_title:0 "Delirium of the Hammer"
 I98_delirium_of_the_hammer_desc:0 ""Days blend to weeks; months blend to years. I don't know how long I've been hammering away at the same old fluid intake valve, but it's been longer than a few days. I don't know how long I haven't seen my children. I don't know if they're still children. I'm tired.""
 I98_lesson_in_moderation_title:0 "A Lesson in Moderation"
 I98_lesson_in_moderation_desc:0 "Legends tell of a goblin of the Vale. He possessed incredible tenacity, boldness, and above all else, desire. He swore that he would live to the fullest. That was, until he tried to bed an ogre. He flew too close to the sun, and ended the encounter half the goblin he once was. An inspiring tale of temperance and humility, and one that we shall take to the heart."
 I98_nevermind_more_is_better_title:0 "Nevermind, More is Better"
 I98_nevermind_more_is_better_desc:0 "After about thirty seconds of living the humble life, our nation is already bored. This cannot go on."
 I98_life_beneath_the_sun_title:0 "Life Beneath the Sun"
 I98_life_beneath_the_sun_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, the only goblins to inhabit the Serpent's Vale have been those bold enough to face down ogres or those stupid enough to think they tasted bad enough to avoid being eaten. Nothing tastes that bad to an ogre. Rest in peace, Stinky Pete. You will be missed."
 I98_prepare_the_tidal_pool_title:0 "Prepare the Tidal Pool"
 I98_prepare_the_tidal_pool_desc:0 "Aside from one, there are very few subterannean lakes large enough to consider building a navy, and the exception in question is simply not worth the risk. That being said, our new passion for the sun (and staring directly at it for hours on end) has resulted in a renewed passion for all things boats. But we need a testing ground. Thankfully, there's already a large uninhabited lake within our grasp. All we need to do is fill it up enough to support naval vessels."
 I98_cleaning_up_title:0 "Cleaning Up"
 I98_cleaning_up_desc:0 "We made a bit of a mess. Turns out the lake wasn't uninhabited, and that the local population was mildly unhappy with our experiments. Their loss, really. Guess it's time to clean up with our fancy gadgets."
 I98_the_accident_title:0 "The "Accident""
 I98_the_accident_desc:0 "We flooded a really big lake. It's mildly concerning, but now we have to figure out what to do with all this water. We tried using it as a water supply for Hul-Jorkad, but upon further inspection, the 'water' is at least 30% motor oil, 18% grime, and 1% Substance X. Hul-Jorkad was not happy with this arrangement. We now need to figure out another place to drain this water, and thankfully, a large unsuspecting subcontinent has done us the favor of existing."
 I98_haven_for_chaos_title:0 "A Haven for Chaos"
 I98_haven_for_chaos_desc:0 "There are no places on the face of Halann that allow one to exist in a state of pure, unadulterated chaos. Thankfully, there is one below that face, burgeoning in a state of metachaos and thriving (suffering) through it. Let us sustain this delicate balance by feeding the chaos and letting it grow."
 I98_involuntary_revenue_service_title:0 "Involuntary Revenue"
 I98_involuntary_revenue_service_desc:0 "The Involuntary Revenue Service, or the IRS, is our primary tax-collecting service. 7/13ths of all economic output is collected and subsequently squandered--in theory. However, our rampant desire to waste money is being hindered by goblins who simply are not paying their taxes. They site such silly reasons as "that's ludicrous" and "I don't feel like paying my taxes". This cannot stand."
 I98_establish_building_standards_title:0 "Gobuilding Standards"
 I98_establish_building_standards_desc:0 "The Frenzy must continue, but there is a fine line between chaos and a hullabaloo. We are veering towards the latter. The Frenzy must continue, but under proper regulation, guided towards at least a moderately productive cause. No more "Fields of Outhouses" or "Lamp^3"."
 I98_municipal_zoning_title:0 "Municipal Zoning"
 I98_municipal_zoning_desc:0 "In the past, goblin zoning measures have consisted of several drunk--and possibly high--individuals wearing tophats drawing random lines through cities and telling the Erectors to have fun. Unfortunately, this has had the undesired effect of being completely awful in every conceivable way. If only there was a better way... aha!"
 I98_articles_of_confoundment_title:0 "Articles of Confoundment"
 I98_articles_of_confoundment_desc:0 "To the silly go the spoils, and to the drunk goes the drab. Such is life in Ves Udzenklan, for a confounded government is too inefficient to make mistakes. The time has come to cement our confoundment in fine print, so it can subsequently be ignored."
 I98_tallest_of_stalactites_title:0 "The Tallest of Stalactites"
 I98_tallest_of_stalactites_desc:0 "Upside down is the new rightside up! We are quickly running out of space on the ground, and after the noble efforts of one goblin who attempted to hang upside down for a week to reach enlightenment (he died), we have unlocked the unlimited (very limited) space available on the ceiling of our caverns!"
 I98_multi_layered_homesteads_title:0 "Multi-Layered Homesteads"
 I98_multi_layered_homesteads_desc:0 "The repeated and suicidal efforts of the Clodhoppers have revealed a delightful truth about the caves we call home: there's a lot more of them than we thought. Many simply aren't on any maps, and even more simply contain ravenous goblin-eating beasts that kill anyone who discovers their abodes. Thankfully, with the development of Subterranean Typography Devices (STDs), goblins no longer need to come back alive to document their discoveries!"
 I98_boom_rock_cave_clearance_title:0 "Boom-Rock Cave Clearance"
 I98_boom_rock_cave_clearance_desc:0 "We used to use Boom-Rocks as rudimentary grenades, but now that we've evolved past that point, the billions of leftover Boom-Rocks are soon to expire in barrels, left unused and unloved. There is no worse crime than squandered explosives, and as such we will use these bombs quickly and rather indiscriminantly."
 I98_industrial_cave_clearance_title:0 "Industrial Cave Clearance"
 I98_industrial_cave_clearance_desc:0 "The Boom-Rocks were such a massive success that we started making actual cave-clearing explosives, specially-manufactured for maximum rubblage. This couldn't possibly go wrong, especially with such competent oversight. Overseer Tim isn't sleeping, he's just closing his eyes to... hear better?"
 I98_gobsolescence_title:0 "Gobsolescence"
 I98_gobsolescence_desc:0 "We have a nasty habit of developing new and improved equipment within several days of approving another, slightly less effective model. This has resulted in millions of underperforming weapons littering our stockpiles, never to be used. For our own sanity, we should probably implement a system of modernizing old equipment instead of just discarding it entirely."
 I98_setting_a_precedent_title:0 "Setting a Precedent"
 I98_setting_a_precedent_desc:0 "We have come a long way since the disunited days of old, scavenging and foraging a means to survive in these dark depths. We are now a proud nation of artificers, ready to face whatever the surface can throw at us. The time has come to formalize our laws. Bring forth the Prefectoriums!"
 I98_goblins_are_great_title:0 "Goblins are Great"
 I98_goblins_are_great_desc:0 "Goblins are truly a noble people, filled with righteous pride and love for our neighbors. We are the most trustworthy, most disciplined, and best-dressed individuals on the face of Halann, and our actions reinforce this notion daily. There is no competition or argument to the contrary. If you find anyone that disagrees, they are an enemy of the state."
 I98_priestly_tax_collectors_title:0 "Priestly Tax Collectors"
 I98_priestly_tax_collectors_desc:0 "Goblin shamans are known to be equal parts pious and charlatans, and this works in our favor. A goblin unswayed by coin is hardly a goblin at all. Leveraging the influence these goblins of "faith" possess over the populace, we can finally establish a moderately efficient tax collection service."
 I98_drug_barons_title:0 "Drug Barons"
 I98_drug_barons_desc:0 "The Harmaceuticals are equal parts merchants and pharmacists. They certainly produce many conniving concoctions, but drugs unsold are drugs squandered. This twofold dynamic brings us such radical fortune that we could not dream of life any other way."
 I98_early_psychotics_experiments_title:0 "Experimental Psychotics"
 I98_early_psychotics_experiments_desc:0 "Through years of questionably legal experimentation, the Harmaceuticals have invented a new line of narcotics: psychotics! Essentially, they work just like narcotics, except every aspect is amplified tenfold. They've been a best-seller to our customers, or at least those that survive their first dose."
 I98_befuddle_the_bureaucracy_title:0 "Befuddle the Bureaucracy"
 I98_befuddle_the_bureaucracy_desc:0 "A befuddled bureaucracy is an efficient one. Oft a source of rampant corruption, bureaucrats have been a thorn in our side since day one. They do nothing but cheat, lie, and keep Ves Udzenklan running smoothly. How dare they!"
 I98_IRS_ceasefire_title:0 "Involuntary Ceasefire"
 I98_IRS_ceasefire_desc:0 "The Tithic Rebellion has been bloody, but we have suffered through far worse. Clodhoppers are no real threat to modern military tactics, and we have one the day with zero casualties (real numbers pending)! Now, we must rest."
 I98_deeper_and_deeper_title:0 "Deeper and Deeper"
 I98_deeper_and_deeper_desc:0 "We have told tales and sung songs of the Great Broodmother, lurking beneath the nests of the west. We believe her to be the mother of all spiders, and quite frankly, it'd be nice to have such a powerful friend on our side."
 I98_magmatic_tempering_title:0 "Magmatic Tempering"
 I98_magmatic_tempering_desc:0 "Hammers swing, children sing, all is well in the forges. We still haven't solved the heatstroke issue, but that doesn't stop our bravest smiths from tempering and toiling to the music of their own clanging."
 I98_military_industrial_gomplex_title:0 "The Industrial Gomplex"
 I98_military_industrial_gomplex_desc:0 "More war means more guns, more guns means more factories, more factories means more war! The cycle shall sustain itself forever, and no amount of naysaying shall stop the gomplex for persisting into perpetuity!"
 I98_gobfuscation_title:0 "Gobfuscation"
 I98_gobfuscation_desc:0 "We must be swift, like the wind. And invisible, also like the wind. Such is the mantra of the Cloak and Swaggers, who have long tried to achieve true invisibility by wearing dark clothing and standing very still. Unfortunately, though effective at fooling the occasional senior citizen, they have fallen short of their goal by a wide margin. Thankfully, the Discombobulatorium has developed something that may just be their answer."
 I98_rocketry_title:0 "Phosphatic Rocketrification"
 I98_rocketry_desc:0 "The process of Phosphatic Rocketrification is one of efficiency. Sure, we can launch a rocket into the sky, but it'll come back down in several seconds once the force of gravity overtakes the dynamite we used to get it up there in the first place. For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring perfection to the crudely conceived idea of a transmission that would not only supply inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such an instrument is the turbo encabulator. The only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance. The original machine had a base plate of pre-famulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the "up" end of the grammeters. The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and it’s being successfully used in the operation of novertrunnions. Moreover, whenever a forescent skor motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm, to reduce sinusoidal repleneration."
 I98_what_goes_up_title:0 "What goes up..."
 I98_what_goes_up_desc:0 "The day has come to launch beautiful Patricia into the air! It is a wondrous occassion for all parties involved. Our brave gobbonauts have already boarded the shuttle, and are patiently waiting for you to press the button. Well, not really "patiently". We allowed them to drink as much as they wanted before flying, seeing as there's basically zero chance of them returning. The cockpit is already trashed, and it's only going to get worse until you press that button."
 I98_may_come_down_title:0 "...May come down"
 I98_may_come_down_desc:0 "They returned."
 I98_discombobulate_title:0 "Discombobulate"
 I98_discombobulate_desc:0 "The Discombobulatorium is in a constant state of innovation. New shoes, new couches, new benches, new sofas, new... long chairs? Regardless of their spontaneity, they are true geniuses, and truly are the lifeblood of our nation. Give them some funding and peace and quiet, and they'll squander all of it. But they might produce something useful in the process."
 I98_setting_up_shop_title:0 "Setting Up Shop"
 I98_setting_up_shop_desc:0 "Despite our extreme success in marketing drugs to our own people, one country simply does not suffice. We need money, and we need it now. Thankfully, there is an entire world outside of these caves that represents an entirely untapped market. To the surface we go!"
 I98_great_goblin_influx_title:0 "The Great Goblin Influx"
 I98_great_goblin_influx_desc:0 "It turns out there's plenty of our old friends on the surface. Well not *our* friends, but our great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents' friends' grandchildren! We should invite them into our Great Goblinic Paradise!"
 I98_railroad_repair_title:0 "Railroad Repair"
 I98_railroad_repair_desc:0 "How are we supposed to get from point A to point B with all these broken tracks? We have bombs and drugs to ship, and wasted time is wasted money. Let's tell the Erectors to get to work!"
 I98_wide_scale_experiments_title:0 "Wide-Scale Experiments"
 I98_wide_scale_experiments_desc:0 "Knowledge is power, and every goblin yearns for power. Not that we aren't already powerful, but more is always better as far as we're concerned. Let's experiment on everything: the best way to make toast, the most efficient manner of brushing teeth, and how to get goblins to actually start brushing their teeth!"
 I98_thaumic_metallurgy_title:0 "Thaumic Metallurgy"
 I98_thaumic_metallurgy_desc:0 "Our experiments have yieled many interesting results, but perhaps the most useful of these have been in the field of metallurgy. Metal, when used right, can be almost anything (as long as the thing is made of metal)! Let's continue along this path of questionably legal experimentation at any cost! After all, what's a little debt in the face of science?"
 I98_buradic_heatstroke_title:0 "Buradic Heatstroke"
 I98_buradic_heatstroke_desc:0 "Okay so, good news and bad news. Good news, we've discovered far easier ways to temper metal, and have esentially revolutionaized metallurgy. Bad news, everyone who knew those secrets immediately and spontaneously burst into flames. So now we need to figure it out all over again."
 I98_hot_and_cold_title:0 "You're Hot and You're Cold"
 I98_hot_and_cold_desc:0 "It turns out that bursting into flames has become a recurring issue. A small flaw in our scientific process, but no matter, for we have the solution! Nestled in the Anvil Mountains is the key to all heat regulation issues, or so we've been told. Let's go on a trip!"
 I98_gobliteration_title:0 "Gobliteration"
 I98_gobliteration_desc:0 "Despite our continued scientific progress, one question has all but plagued the minds of our chief Discombobulators: what if it used more explosives? this has led to many unfortunate accidents, but most of all, we've discovered the incredible speed dynamite has to offer. What if we accelerated all of our railcarts with some modified strip mining equipment?"
 I98_horrific_beasts_title:0 "Horrific Beasts..."
 I98_horrific_beasts_desc:0 "Above us: an inhospitable wasteland that few could ever hope to inhabit. Below: goblin-eating beasts the likes of which one can hardly comprehend. We'll take the beasts."
 I98_where_to_tame_them_title:0 "...And Where to Tame Them"
 I98_where_to_tame_them_desc:0 "With each passing generation, more and more vital knowledge is lost. No one remembers where the Goopy Goblineater resides, but we're pretty sure it's somewhere around where we just built our new orphanage. We should probably write this stuff down."
 I98_shock_and_awe_title:0 "Shock and Awe and Raids"
 I98_shock_and_awe_desc:0 "For once, the Prefectoriums are in agreement: we need more land. The Serpentspine has become uncharacteristically full of life (and angry dwarves) in recent years, and as such we may need to take unprecedented measures in capturing this land for ourselves. What's a little elbow grease when fun is on the line?"
 I98_other_clans_title:0 "Other Clans"
 I98_other_clans_desc:0 "Much to our shock, it turns out we're not the only goblins. There are more, and they are pitiful. They still bathe in mud, and eat bugs, and... well maybe we're similar than we thought. Nonetheless, we should invite these lil' guys to our great nation!"
 I98_specialized_trains_title:0 "Specialized Trains"
 I98_specialized_trains_desc:0 "Decades ago, we affirmed our desire to standardize trains for one singular purpose: moving stuff. But as it turns out, not all stuff is moved in the same way. Too much jostling, and our explosives will fulfill their purpose a bit early. Too hot, and our produce will produce its own produce. We should really work on that."
 I98_heated_experiments_title:0 "Heated Experiments"
 I98_heated_experiments_desc:0 ""To master one's self, one first must master the elements" -some human nerd. Despite being entirely too tall and not green, this human may have a point. We've only really mastered one elementa, which would be the element of surprise, and surprising steel doesn't make it temper any faster ...or maybe it does, and we've actually mastered none of the elements. Regardless, our goal remains the same."
 I98_krakdhumic_chill_title:0 "Krakdhûmic Chill"
 I98_krakdhumic_chill_desc:0 "The cold is not our strongsuit. In fact, caves are quite warm, especially when you pump them full of industrial exhaust and furnace fumes. Heat transfer is a recurring issue, and perhaps a chilly wind would do us some good."
 I98_synthetics_for_sale_title:0 "Synthetics for Sale"
 I98_synthetics_for_sale_desc:0 "Naturally grown drugs are expensive, and simply put, a waste to sell. Why bother with the effort when our clients can't tell the different? Let's save the good stuff for us, and market our newfound synthetic psychotics to the loathesome Cannorians!"
 I98_rainbow_goblins_title:0 "The Rainbow Goblins"
 I98_rainbow_goblins_desc:0 "I'll be honest, this is weird, even for us. Our synthetic psychotics have had the unfortunate side-effect of turning goblins entirely different colors, with different mixes producing different spectacles. We're not sure if there are any other side-effects, but in the meantime, we're treating this as an intentional effect, and it has increased the drug's popularity tenfold. We'll see if we start having rainbow funerals soon enough, but until then, let's party!"
 I98_natvirod_exchange_title:0 "The Natvirod Exchange"
 I98_natvirod_exchange_desc:0 "The opening of the Marrhold Tunnel has led to unprecedented wealth flowing through what would otherwise be Clodhopper territory. The Harmaceuticals already muscled their way into the province, but the Natvirod has quickly become a focal point of the Klans."
 I98_multi_level_marketing_title:0 "Multi-Level Marketing"
 I98_multi_level_marketing_desc:0 "The Harmaceuticals had an idea. What if we get some Cannorians to pay us money in return for simply nothing? Genius, we know, but the question of how still remains. This is where psychological warfare comes into play. We'll convince them that they can get money from other Cannorians if they pay us, using our massive mercantile empire as legitimacy for our claims!"
 I98_should_have_seen_this_coming_title:0 "A Predictable Outcome"
 I98_should_have_seen_this_coming_desc:0 "The utter fools have fallen for our devious and well-crafted scheme!"

 # EVENTS
 allclan.1.title:0 "The Pragmatic Codification"
 allclan.1.desc:0 "In the heart of Ves Udzenklan, the leaders of the five distinct Pentapandemoniac Prefectoriums convened, each representing a facet of the nation's rich culture and history, paving the way for the unification of the West Serpentspine.\n\nFirst among them was the eccentric figurehead of the Discombobulatorium, a gathering of wizards and artificers who thrived in the realm of chaos, their unpredictable experiments setting the tone for the meeting. Beside him sat the Clodhoppers, the daring and audacious adventurers who fearlessly tamed the labyrinthine caverns of the Serpentspine. With their jovial spirit and unrivaled knowledge of the subterranean landscape, he contributed his unique perspective to the discussions. Next, the Cloak and Swaggers brought their shroud of mystery to the gathering. Assassins, rogues, and the vigilant state military formed their ranks, their silent presence a reminder of the special skills that ensured the nation's safety. Following the Cloak and Swaggers came the mask-clad Harmaceuticals, offering a touch of unconventional expertise. As creators of both pharmaceutical wonders and controlled (and uncontrolled) substances, their role was vital in the nation's intricate balance. Last but not least, the Glorious Erectors, master builders of the realm, contributed their vision to the assembly. Their dedication to crafting marvels that defied both logic and gravity stood as a testament to the creativity that abounded within Ves Udzenklan.\n\nTogether, amidst the eclectic assembly, they embarked on a monumental task: forging a cohesive set of rules for their new nation. With a shared commitment to stability amidst the eccentricity, they etched their agreement onto a steadfast rock. Here, amidst the fusion of chaos and order, the leaders of Ves Udzenklan penned the promises that would shape the nation's future, a testimony to the harmonious collaboration of the Pentapandemoniac Prefectoriums."
 allclan.1.a:0 "...and then we §Osmashed the rock.§!"
 allclan.2.title:0 "Goblins are Great"
 allclan.2.desc:0 "When asked about the greatest nation, Ves Udzenklan undeniably springs to mind as the first choice for all who respond. Our Discombobulatorium consistently churns out innovation after innovation. The Glorious Erectors construct marvels previously unseen in the many caverns and roads of the Serpentspine, while the Harmaceuticals ensure that their products flow down the rails at a remarkable pace. The Cloddhopper’s expeditions into the depths of our cave-dwellings yield ancient treasures one after another, flooding wealth through the streets of our Holds and bending the creatures within to our command. The Cloak and Swaggers adeptly infiltrate the innermost circles of our neighboring realms, unearthing every secret and discovering every angle to exploit.\n\nMithril extracted from our mines finds its way to markets from Castonath to Brasan, while our Iron is forged in smithies across Cannor and Gerudia – from plate and sword to tools and fineware. Serpentbloom springs forth in abundance, nourishing the ever-expanding goblin population. The bounty of the Serpentspine is readily available at their fingertips, regardless of their residence within these bounds. Our elite armies are unmatched, ready to face any adversary with nothing but the finest in arms and armor, defending the glory and safety of our people.\n\nAcross Ves Udzenklan, the citizens bask in the prosperity and riches, an unprecedented luxury within these dark corridors. From Khugdihr to Hul Jorkad, every goblin within our borders experiences the stability provided by our nation. Our achievements stand higher than any in the past, and it is likely that none will rival them anytime soon. Our greatness towers above all else on Halann."
 allclan.2.a:0 "Surely nothing bad will happen now."
 allclan.3.title:0 "The Erecting Frenzy"
 allclan.3.desc:0 "It all began slowly, with a modest uptick in construction material requests from the Glorious Erectors for Massive Shaft – an approval granted. Subsequently, the allocation of quarried stone for maintenance to Khugdihr was doubled, another request granted. Vast quantities of glass and marble were dispatched from Bulwar to Dur Vazahtun, a flow of iron substantial enough to build kilometers of rail to Er-Natvir, and copious amounts of wood and copper sent hurtling down the rails toward Hul Jorkad. Sheets of documentation detailing the staggering number of construction projects initiated over the past two decades sprawled across the floor, extending the entire length of the Erectors' offices.\n\nSpools of invoices and records piled as high as the Ogres in the Vale, each entry recording incomprehensibly immense quantities of purchases earmarked for increasingly whimsical structures. Statues within Holds, houses stacked upon houses, and entire new rail networks branching seemingly into oblivion across the entire expanse of the mountains, accompanied by new trains to transport the acquired materials to their new destinations. The source of funding for these endeavors remains somewhat enigmatic, yet no cautionary alerts have emanated from the Treasury, thereby leaving us without any substantial reason to halt this ongoing progression."
 allclan.3.a:0 "§OThis is a good idea.§!"
 allclan.5.title:0 "A Cure for Homelessness"
 allclan.5.desc:0 "As crazy as it sounds, our overgobulation issues are slowly being solved through the construction of new homes! The new homes are surprisingly affordable, and impoverished goblins across the nation are finding themselves in better situations every day."
 allclan.5.a:0 "What wondrous news!"
 allclan.6.title:0 "Gobonomics"
 allclan.6.desc:0 "Over the many years of the Erection Frenzy, we have developed an incredibly efficient method of financing continued construction. We market unbuilt homes to families looking to pre-order housing, then proceed to use the generated funds to finance more houses!"
 allclan.6.a:0 "Such a system could never fail!"
 allclan.7.title:0 "Debtor-Subsidized Erection"
 allclan.7.desc:0 "Funds for continued constructions have begun to run dry, and as such, several major construction companies have begun to take short-term highly liquid loans from questionable sources. Such fortuitous thinking has resulted in a second building boom. Though some critics suggest caution in the face of over-leveraged gobuilding companies, but we know better than to stop while we're in the lead!"
 allclan.7.a:0 "All I see is green."
 allclan.8.title:0 "Minor Loan Defaults"
 allclan.8.desc:0 "The various companies and firms that have been at the heart of the construction craze across Ves Udzenklan have begun to default on some of their loans, causing several sites to cease work unfinished across our holds. Several of these companies had been overleveraged for years now, taking increasing debt in an attempt to stop their downward spiral, as their loan repayments continued to spike and spike over time. The banks who had financed these loans have come to the Prefectorium to ask for assistance in recouping their losses from these defaulted loans. This has also led to several housing projects being canceled, as the companies constructing them have gone bankrupt and been liquidated, assets seized by the banks and state where possible as collateral."
 allclan.8.a:0 "I'm sure we've already seen the worst of it."
 allclan.9.title:0 "A Bloody Morning on the Natvirod"
 allclan.9.desc:0 "So it appears that when companies are left to take loans repeatedly to finance construction projects with little to no financial viability, it tends to result in repercussions. We have certainly become intimately aware of this, as even more construction companies across our territories have defaulted under the weight of accumulating debts from various banks within our borders. As these banks request assistance in recovering their losses and are met with silence, they proceed to deny withdrawal requests from their clients. Consequently, nearly all commercial and industrial enterprises across Ves Udzenklan have ground to a halt, as companies lack access to the necessary funds for functioning.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the housing market has been the most heavily impacted sector. With promised homes and apartments left unfinished, thousands of goblins are now confronted with homelessness. This issue has been compounded by a colossal spike in housing prices due to the complete absence of new constructions, causing the existing problem of overpopulation to reach new heights. Rental properties have seen a tenfold increase in cost, and already strained housing programs have nearly ceased functioning, with wait times stretching up to a decade in some regions. This situation has persisted for days, as various attempts to alleviate this economic plummet have been no more than mere drops in the deepest lakes of the Serpentspine."
 allclan.9.a:0 "How could we have seen this coming?"
 allclan.10.title:0 "Properties Repossessed"
 allclan.10.desc:0 "Various constructions funded by financial institutions throughout our country have been repossessed as collateral, in an effort to curb the economic losses they are experiencing due to the Gobblivion Property Plunge. The residents of these properties are far from content, yet they possess limited means to prevent this action. The issue of overgobulation is beginning to surge to unprecedented levels as Holds become overcrowded with goblins on the streets. Food supplies are being stretched thin, and with no resolution in sight, the outlook is grim."
 allclan.10.a:0 "Such greed! We're so proud."
 allclan.11.title:0 "Street Riots"
 allclan.11.desc:0 "It began with a protest. Millions of goblins marched along the steps of the Prefectorium, demanding a solution to the overpopulation issue that has been devastating our country.

This clandestine marketplace, shrouded in perpetual twilight, is a haven for the cunning and the daring. The air crackles with whispered bargains, and the scent of greed hangs thickly amidst the damp, echoing tunnels.\n\nBut beware, for this is no ordinary marketplace. Here, the goblins have established their own chaotic stock market, a frenzied arena where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye. The Goblin Bazaar, fueled by an insatiable thirst for wealth and power, thrives on volatility and revels in disorder.\n\nAn eerie symphony of frantic shouts and clinking gold fills the cavernous space as frenzied goblin traders, eyes wide with avarice, jostle for prime positions. Like wild animals, they fight tooth and nail, trading with feverish urgency, propelled by a manic desire to strike it rich. Rumor has it that fortunes beyond imagination can be won, but at what cost? With every flicker of candlelight, tensions ignite like a powder keg. A single misplaced word, a misunderstood gesture, and the bubbling chaos erupts into explosive violence. Blades are drawn, and the once-boisterous market transforms into a battlefield, littered with the fallen and the broken dreams of ambitious goblins.\n\nFor those brave or foolhardy enough to enter this den of anarchy, great riches await, but the risks are equally immense. Forget profits, one's life is at risk along these sunless roads. Let the bartering begin!"

With the recent extremely violent passing of the hold's former governor, the time has come to elect a new official to oversee operations.
