 # Allclan Mission Events
 allclan.1.t:0 "Choose our Focus" #Used for allclan.1-4
 allclan.1.d:0 "From humble beginnings skulking in shadowed caverns, our clan has prospered. We have created a uniquely goblin Serpentspine, an Allclan for all goblins.\n Without the looming threat of extinction, the various factions of our clan have begun to squabble amongst themselves for dominance. If we don't show clear support for one or another, our union may fail before it even begins.\n\n The machinists and weaponsmiths have formed a union of technocrats known as the Zukovinkraty. They advocate for supremacy through innovation and invention. \n\n The once disparate clanbosses and their cronies have banded together to reform the horde into a functional and efficient state, capable of matching the direct control displayed by the great empires of the world. They call themselves the Fubaristi.\n\n One can never discount the clan in shadows, the Kartelklanovi. The cartels have a strong grasp on all monetary ventures of the clans, and have become a formidable force in the political arena. \n As the unifier of the Allclan, our choice may well tip the balance. Which faction deserves our support?"
 allclan.1.a:0 "Laud the Technocrats."
 allclan.1.b:0 "It was bold leadership that brought us here."
 allclan.1.c:0 "The cartels provided the cash to make this happen."
 
 allclan.5.t:0 "The Dwarven Decision"
 allclan.5.d:0 "Dwarves are hardy, diligient workers. They are also profoundly stubborn, and demonstrate an intense hatred of all goblins. They may eventually make for good slave labour, but keeping them around may be more trouble than its worth."
 allclan.5.a:0 "Purge them."
 allclan.5.b:0 "Put them in ghettos."
 allclan.5.c:0 "Our current policy is fine"
 allclan.6.t:0 "The Orcish Inquiry"
 allclan.6.d:0 "We have a long history with the orcs. In ancient days we would struggle side by side against dwarven oppression. The mountains still hold vast numbers of orcs, and they will be a valuable resource if we can pacify them. That being said, the tensions inflicted by the Greentide run deep, and there are factions demanding vengeance for their treatment of goblinkind. By any means necessary."
 allclan.6.a:0 "Purge them."
 allclan.6.b:0 "Send them to the ghettos."
 allclan.7.t:0 "The Kobold Quandary"
 allclan.7.d:0 "Kobolds are an interesting lot. They tend to be a nuisance if left unmanaged; stealing gold from the clan's banks, laying traps on otherwise mundane corridors, and generally being pests. However, we do recognize that many in the world would consider us goblins in a similar light. If we can tolerate their strange ways, the Allclan could expand to incorporate the kobolds. If not, well.. they will not be missed."
 allclan.7.a:0 "Purge them."
 allclan.7.b:0 "Treat them as second-class citizens."
 allclan.8.t:0 "A Role for the Kobolds"
 allclan.8.d:0 "Kobolds thrive on purpose. As it stands, that purpose, being to horde wealth, often gets in the way of the plans of other parts of goblin society. Each of the factions envisions a different approach to solving this issue.\n\n The Technocrats look at kobolds and see minds almost as bright as goblins, but without the ambition to be great. This is excellent. There has been a running problem in goblin technical circles whereby an assistant will stab their superior in the back (often literally) to get credit for a discovery. Kobold assistants will be far more complient, and as a bonus - more expendable.\n\n The Reformists see an opportunity to fill vacancies in their least successful sector of their new state: law enforcement. Goblins are free-spirited at best and anarchistic at worst, leading very few to law enforcement. Those that do persue such a career all want to be the boss, with precincts having almost as much politicking and backstabbing as the Nezkaru council. Filling the ranks with obedient kobolds would solve a world of trouble for the Reformists.\n\n The Cartels don't much care for the kobolds. They seem to be an uninspired, obedient lot. What the Cartels do care about is kobold gold. New arrivals always seem to have plenty of gold on them, and communities of kobolds always seem to be acquiring more gold than they ought to, even as the community around them seems to lose out. So the Cartels encourage this wealth-seeking behaviour, all they suggest is an extra tax levied across the Allclan, whereby all citizens' taxes will be increased proportionally to the length of their tail. Does this almost explicitly target kobolds? Yes. Does it encourage wily kobolds to self-mutilate to decrease their tax-burden? Also yes. The cartels are comfortable with these implications."
 allclan.8.a:0 "Send them to be lab assistants."
 allclan.8.b:0 "Their muscle will make them good bailiffs."
 allclan.8.c:0 "They can contribute with a tail tax. We've got to ensure that buildings are up-to-code for tailed citizens somehow!"
 allclan.9.t:0 "The Kobolds Spread"
 allclan.9.d:0 "With their new role secured, the tension between kobold and goblin has eased. Throughout our nation tribes of kobolds are settling into goblin communities and improving productivity."
 allclan.9.a:0 "This is good for the goblins (and the kobolds, I suppose)"

 allclan.10.t:0 "Council Debate: How to Move the Orcs to the New Farms"
 allclan.10.d:0 "The Nezkaru council has called a special assembly to deal with the newest item of policy. It is a remarkably calm one, with only two bombings and a poisoning that have disturbed the proceedings so far. The issue currently under debate in the council is that of the orcs, specifically how best to move them to the new farms we have prepared.\n\nThe debate, as it always does, has coalesced into three policies supported by one of the major political factions.\n\nThe Zukovinkraty position is that the process offers an excellent opportunity to test the latest inventions and give our military some practice. Their plan might take longer, but offers to make the enterprise serve a dual prupose.\n\nThe Fubaristi plan is to simply force the orcs to move the old fashioned way. They claim it will be both swift, cheap, and nationally important to allow the goblin masses to push the orcs out as a united effort. No doubt a ploy to win themselves some influence with some of the easier fooled masses, but a workable and likely swift suggestion.\n\nFinally, the Kartelklanovi see this as another opportunity to make money. They claim that the council can encourage various cartels to put their own money into the whole affair by offering farm production futures and land allotments to goblins for sale, meaning more money all around. The hidden impact of their plan is that we will likely make more money selling them once the orcish labor is in place, but the impact might not be so much."
 allclan.10.a:0 "Sounds like a perfect opportunity to test some new weapons!"
 allclan.10.b:0 "Orcs respect strength right? Why not show them some."
 allclan.10.c:0 "Why not just solve it with money? We have some generous donations lined up."

 allclan.11.t:0 "The Project is Complete"
 allclan.11.d:0 "Orcs handled."
 allclan.11.a:0 "We made the right choice."
 
 allclan.12.t:0 "Council Debate: Showing the Dwarves their Place"
 allclan.12.d:0 "The members of the council are giddy with anticipation as they ready to decide just how to strip the dwarves down to size. Every clan in Serpentspine has tales of how their people were purged, enslaved, demeaned, or embarressed by dwarves throughout history. Well we're on top now.\n\n The alchemists of the Zukovinkraty guild put forward plans to engineer a fear gas that can be pumped into the dwarven ghettos. This will create a persistent environment of paranoia, panic, and anxiety. There is widespread support for this plan; show them how it feels to cower in the dark, terrified for your life, feeling like you are hunted at all hours. Soon they'll be begging us for labour assignments just to get free of the gas.\n\n The Fubaristi think that the Zukovinkraty solution is over-engineered, as always. They think it will be enough to simply treat them how they deserve. Regular beatings to within an inch of their life. Gruel that isn't fit for an Ogre. Forcing them to break rocks with their bare hands. Straightforward will-breaking. Dwarven resilience just means they can get in that much more misery before they break.\n\n Last but not least, the Kartelklanovi suggest using the dwarves' own fatal flaw against them; their greed. Dwarven greed has been the fall of powerful empires. It can tear families apart. With a little incentive, dwarven community leaders can be cooerced into betraying their people to earn an easy life for themselves, leaving the remainder in a perfectly demoralized and pliable state."
 allclan.12.a:0 "Start brewing the fear gas immediately."
 allclan.12.b:0 "Make their lives a living nightmare."
 allclan.12.c:0 "Use their greed against them."
 
 allclan.13.d:0 "Dwarves handled."
 
 allclan.14.t:0 "A Demand to the Tree of Stone"
 allclan.14.d:0 "We make a simple demand of the Undergrowth Dens; aknowledge our right to rule, or prepare for war."
 allclan.15.t:0 "An Envoy to the Triarchy"
 allclan.15.d:0 "An ambassador has been sent to act as cultural envoy to the Triarchy. With any luck, they will be able to establish a knowledge sharing initiative with the Triarchy. The secrets of Aelentir will be ours!"
 allclan.15.a:0 "Reach out for some idea exchange"
 
 allclan.16.t:0 "What to Do With our Guns?"
 allclan.16.d:0 "Guns are great. Really! But now, gnomes have guns, and soon the whole world! How can we make our guns the best guns to ever gun?"
 allclan.16.a:0 "I like big guns I can't deny"
 allclan.16.b:0 "What if they shot... bombs?"
 allclan.16.c:0 "What if we put knives on them?"
 allclan.16.e:0 "I wanna see how many bullets we can shoot"
 allclan.16.f:0 "Guns for our crawlers! Guns for our crawlers!"

 allclan.17.a:0 "Clear some space... with bombs."
 allclan.17.b:0 "Sounds like a perfect time for favor-trading."
 allclan.17.c:0 "Put our lazy citizens to work!"

 allclan.18.t:0 "A Demand of the Deepwoods"
 allclan.18.d:0 "Scouts have been sent throughout the Deepwoods to spread the message to the forest clans; the Allclan offers protection. Failure to accept this offer will be taken as an act of rebellion." 
 allclan.18.a:0 "Demand tribute."
 allclan.18.b:0 "Demand vassalization."
 allclan.19.t:0 "A Demand of Escann"
 allclan.19.d:0 "All goblins are citizens of the Allclan. It is time to let our kin in Escann know." 
 allclan.20.t:0 "A Demand of the Bulwari"
 allclan.20.d:0 "A lucrative offer has been sent to the exodus clans. In exchange for access to their trade networks and agriculture the armies of the Allclan will provide defence in times of war. They would be wise to consider this offer carefully." 

 allclan.21.t:0 "Election Reform"
 allclan.21.d:0 "Goblin elections can be a chaotic affair. It's considered bad luck for your term if your political headquarters doesn't get firebombed a half dozen times during election season. The factions see room for improvement.\n\n The Technocrats have better things to do than watch the populace get consumed with partisan fervor; there is science to be done! They have drafted a proposal for a greatly streamlined election process. On the day of the election, and no sooner, will bosses anounce their candidacy. They will have until end of day to debate, rally votes, kiss hand, shake babies and what-not. At end of day, everything is voted on; clan leaders, guild representatives, legal referendums, and so on. Absolutely no more voting during the rest of the political term. The perfect system for those honestly would do anything else.\n\n The Reformists want to extend years between elections. Getting goblins to agree on anything takes a long time, moreso if you actually want to do anything so complex as legislate. The Reformists want to get things done, and to them that means they need the extra time in power.\n\n Of course, the chaos of the political cycle does benefit some. The cartels' influence over an election is magnified when upheaval is common, funds are low, and tensions are high. Naturally, they support decreasing the interval between elections. Let the bosses play their games, money is the only true ruler of the Allclan."
 allclan.21.a:0 "Consolidate voting, to leave more time for tinkering."
 allclan.21.b:0 "Longer terms are necessary to implement any policy."
 allclan.21.c:0 "The constant churn of shorter terms will be best."

 # Jaw Street
 allclan.74.t:0 "Jaw Street: The Founding"
 allclan.74.d:0 "Jaw Street, named for the toothy, jagged stalactites and stalagmites that ring its looming entrance. While originally used by the Gob boss “Big Jaw Jergel” to shake down folks who didn’t hear his associates right the first time, the place has of late become a home for a much more modernized, and civilized form of swindling. Jergel has taken to encouraging anyone he’s having a little chat with to invest in certificates of ownership known as “stocks” belonging to the merchants and businesses that pay for his “protection”. Furthermore, these papers seem to be more and more valuable as time goes on. While we’re still wrapping our heads around this particular racket, we could surely skim some coin off the top before it falls apart."
 allclan.74.a:0 "You see, things have value because people think they have value..."
 allclan.74.b:0 "Does seventy-thirty sound like a fair split?"

 allclan.75.t:0 "Jaw Street: Seed Capital"
 allclan.75.d:0 "Much to our surprise, Jaw Street is booming! Impressively, it’s become the premier way to make your money into even more money, beating out gambling and alchemy with its lower risk of bodily harm. While we’d only expected this particular scam to last for a few months before there needed to be a show of rounding Jergel up for his crimes, and admonishing any of our own who participated in this, his stock market has caught on fire, in every sense of the word. With the smoke clearing, these incidents have inspired better bookkeeping practices, and a fair deal of fights over the lost documentation. Regardless, everything is coming up green for the goblins down on Jaw Street. However, some naysayers suggest the bubble may be bursting. Should we cash out, or hold? If we stay in, and legitimize this venture, we’ll need to more officially integrate it into our economy."

Many have lost everything, or have become outraged that so many of our people live in poverty as our leadership grows exponentially wealthier. While we hardly care, being those lucky few ourselves, it has been pointed out that firstly, it seems detrimental to the ideal of the Allclan, that we might be leaving our people to starve. Secondly, the sticks that those signs are tied to do look quite excruciatingly pointy. Perhaps we should address the issue, before they decide to give us a closer look.""
 allclan.76.a:0 "Get rid of them! If they’ve got no money, what are they worth?"

 allclan.77.t:0 "Jaw Street: Capital's Capital"
 allclan.77.d:0 "While the original entrance of Jaw Street proved pitifully small for its booming traffic, the artistic rendition that replaced it has more than sufficed to capture the extravagance and luxury of the place, a set of golden teeth, an idealized form of those jagged jaws now arches up from the floor surrounding the road, between the lanes, and from the ceiling above, a savage, toothy grin that reflects the cut-throat nature that remains as a holdover from its shady past. The walls of the way are lined with windows into bustling offices, shimmering storefronts that offer the perfect place to turn those stocks into more tangible luxuries. While whispers persist that the heart of our nation has shifted from the council’s chambers to the floor beneath the big bell at the exchange’s center, it’s hard to deny that the place gathers coin on every surface like a misty morning leaves dew."

While purse-snatchers zooming by in their spiderless carriages and golem enforcers shaking down our impeccably honest entrepreneurs were bad enough, a bandit making off with a satchel of certificates from the exchange lit the fuse on the Bowling Lava-tube Rocket, and took it straight through the ceiling.
