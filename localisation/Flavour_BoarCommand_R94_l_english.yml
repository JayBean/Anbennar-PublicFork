 boar_command_veteran_camp_tier_1_desc:0 "While most Boarborn serve as soldiers between the ages of 16 and 60, there is space in the Boar Command for those who are old or infirm. As there is a camp for war, so must there also be a camp for peace. The Camp of Quiescence is a Boarborn institution where those wounded in war or too old to fight go to live out their days in peace. Children visit often, and families live just a stone's throw away. The heroes of today look on at the heroes of yesterday to know that there is indeed something waiting for them past the bloodshed."
