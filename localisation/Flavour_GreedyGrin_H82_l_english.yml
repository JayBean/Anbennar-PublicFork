 # Missions
 greedy_grin_create_vault_title:0 "Create a Great Vault"
 greedy_grin_create_vault_desc:0 "Every goblin in Greedy Grin knows that a large coin collection will bring them luck. But the great vaults of Verkal Gulan have shown us just how big a collection can get.\n\nWe will improve upon the dwarves' designs to create a coin vault that will span an entire province and bless us one and all with luck once it is filled."
 greedy_grin_create_vault_guard_title:0 "Create the Vault Guard"
 greedy_grin_create_vault_guard_desc:0 "The coin vault was hardly finished when errant goblins first attempted to pilfer some coins. So far, each attempt has been successfully thwarted -- we built plenty of watch-posts into the dwarven foundations -- but it is clear that we should invest in creating a vault guard to protect the coin vault from any inventive thief. And, of course, we need extremely strict requirements for these vault guards, so that they don't take anything home themselves."
 greedy_grin_fill_vault_title:0 "Fill the Vault"
 greedy_grin_fill_vault_desc:0 "The vault is built. It is secured. Now it’s time to fill it to the brim -- and 20 thousand crowns should be a good start, if an insufficient one!"
 greedy_grin_expand_vault_guard_title:0 "Expand the Vault Guard"
 greedy_grin_expand_vault_guard_desc:0 "More coins in the vault means more thieves after those coins, and the recent increase has gone beyond our treasurers’ expectations.\n\nWe must expand the Vault Guard in turn, though with their numbers getting high, perhaps a few can be tasked to protect other important areas as well."
 greedy_grin_vault_worthy_title:0 "A Worthy Vault"
 greedy_grin_vault_worthy_desc:0 "Every day more and more wealth is being produced and our clan is thriving more than ever, no doubt thanks to the coinvault we built and filled with 20,000 crowns, but this is still not enough and we should spend another 40,000 crowns, to fill the coinvault with mountains of pure gold coins, to further our prosperity and allow every goblin in our clan a further increase in luck.\n\n It will be truly marvelous."
 greedy_grin_gate_to_east_title:0 "The Gate to the East"
 greedy_grin_gate_to_east_desc:0 "After taking Gor Ozumbrog, we now have free access to the Tree of Stone. We should conquer the dwarven holds within it, and then take control of the goblins that live in its caves."
 greedy_grin_tree_stone_title:0 "Into the Tree of Stone"
 greedy_grin_tree_stone_desc:0 "Following our expansion into Ovdal Kanzad and Grôzumdihr, we border a strange goblin nation that nigh-worships a single goblin. We should free these goblins from their chains and show them that wealth, not some strange mage, is the best past forward."
 greedy_grin_destroy_chains_title:0 "Destroy the Chains"
 greedy_grin_destroy_chains_desc:0 "Having taken control of most of Tree of Stone and showing more goblins the truth that wealth is best, we now border a so-called slave state of the Hobgoblin Command, which views goblins only as slaves while seeking military power. Their discipline will be buried beneath our coin!"
 greedy_grin_second_capital_title:0 "A Second Capital"
 greedy_grin_second_capital_desc:0 "Our conquest in the Tree of Stone and against the Command has expanded our nation by quite a bit and stretched our government. We should invest some of the wealth we have acquired in building a second capital in Grônstunad to better control the eastern Serpentspine."
 greedy_grin_hold_of_gold_title:0 "A Hold of Gold"
 greedy_grin_hold_of_gold_desc:0 "We have information about a dwarven hold that is said to be made entirely of gold. Although the rumor is probably exaggerated, even a trace of truth is tantalizing. We should go see for ourselves and capture whatever wealth remains."
 greedy_grin_mountain_of_gold_title:0 "A Mountain of Gold"
 greedy_grin_mountain_of_gold_desc:0 "The rumor was true! Well, the entire hold is not made of gold, but between the amount of gold found in the vaults and the amount yet to be mined is enough to build an unimaginably huge mountain of gold.\n\nWe have found a Paradise. But gold is not the only think that sparkles bright, and we hear to the west, there is a gem-rich Hold ripe for the plunder."
 greedy_grin_plunder_seghdihr_title:0 "Plunder Seghdihr"
 greedy_grin_plunder_seghdihr_desc:0 "We have successfully reached Seghdihr, it is time to attack the dwarves and take control of the hold to rob it of its wealth and gems."
 greedy_grin_expand_into_caverns_title:0 "Expand into the Caverns"
 greedy_grin_expand_into_caverns_desc:0 "Between the gems of Seghdihr and the gold of Verkal Gulan, we have achieved a level of wealth never before seen in Greedy Grin. Now it is time to invest our wealth and take control of the surrounding caves teeming with other goblins to increase the power of our nation.\n\nTo the east lies the the Tree of Stone, teeming with our brethren, and Gor Ozumbrog will act as our stepping stone into there."
 greedy_grin_going_west_title:0 "Grinning West"
 greedy_grin_going_west_desc:0 "Our expansion in the caves and on the roads has reached the old dwarven hold of Hehodovar. Another Hold under our control will soon mean more coins in our vaults!"
 greedy_grin_gate_to_west_title:0 "The Gate to the West"
 greedy_grin_gate_to_west_desc:0 "Having taken Hehodovar, we can now move west to Gor Vazumbrog. The Gateway to the West will be a perfect hold to secure our nation's western territories. It is controlled by orcs riding drakes, but against our numbers and wealth they will be destroyed."
 greedy_grin_unite_middele_dwarovar_title:0 "Unite Middle Dwarovar"
 greedy_grin_unite_middele_dwarovar_desc:0 "We have taken control of all the dwarven holds in the middle dwarovar and the roads. We have also already started to control some of the caverns, we should now take complete control of the middle Dwarovar to unify our home region."
 greedy_grin_domination_title:0 "Domination"
 greedy_grin_domination_desc:0 "Having conquered large parts of the Eastern Serpenspine and defeated the Hobgoblin Command in several battles, we should now unite the Eastern Serpentspine under our rule and exile the Command completely from our mountains."
 greedy_grin_wealth_unimaginabel_title:0 "Wealth Unimaginable"
 greedy_grin_wealth_unimaginabel_desc:0 "Our vault is immaculate. Our conquests vast. Our nation -- perfected. And as such, we must ensure the golden jewel in our golden crown is equal to our feats, by building a capital worthy of the great Greedy Grin"
 greedy_grin_secure_food_title:0 "Secure Our Food"
 greedy_grin_secure_food_desc:0 "Unfortunately, while gold may be key to our survival, we cannot actually eat it. No matter how busy our mines get, we do need to also increase our food supplies. Establishing large farms of serpentbloom in the great cavern should be sufficient."
 greedy_grin_feeding_nation_title:0 "Feeding a Nation"
 greedy_grin_feeding_nation_desc:0 "Acquiring more gold! And gems, and silver, and land that bears every other precious metal! That is where our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] places most of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attention… but alas, the chief advisor cannot be denied when she points to our ever-growing population and its ever-growing needs. It seems today, we must look away from the mines, and focus again on our Serpentbloom farms."
 greedy_grin_dominance_serpentbloom_trade_title:0 "Serpentbloom Dominance"
 greedy_grin_dominance_serpentbloom_trade_desc:0 "Our continuous investment and the advantages offered by the Levy system allow us to produce a lot of serpentbloom already. But if we can dominate trade in the food-stuff, either directly or through our connections, we may be able to establish profitable cartels and reap gold from all these crops."
 greedy_grin_system_feed_millions_title:0 "How To Feed Millions?"
 greedy_grin_system_feed_millions_desc:0 "In our capital, cooks make new creations out of simple Serpentbloom for the wealthy elite, making use of the foodstuff’s abundance and discarding plenty of mishewn creations on the kitchen floor. But in smaller caverns, far from our country's gems, goblins go hungry -- some even starve.\n\nEnough! We must ensure the Serpentbloom cartels dole out food with an even hand, and have the rail network in place to do so, such that all in [Root.GetName] eat well -- or at least sufficiently -- every night."
 greedy_grin_peace_time_prosperity_title:0 "Prosperity Through Peace"
 greedy_grin_peace_time_prosperity_desc:0 "The Middle Dwarovar is united. It is safe. And it is prosperous. In peace, we truly see every goblin flourish, from the artisans’ new creations to the constant deepening of the mines to the steady growth of the Serpentbloom farms. And with our levy system, we know perfectly what every one of our workers is doing -- and each and every one is furthering this great prosperity."
 greedy_grin_army_reforms_title:0 "Greedy Grin Army Reforms"
 greedy_grin_army_reforms_desc:0 "For a long time now, the levy system and our food system have worked together to enable the functioning of our nation, with many conflating the two. One current problem, however, is the right to plunder: an idea we introduced when we reformed war taxes, but which often causes problems as some goblins grow rich from war, whiel others merely lose their land or limbs. If we eliminate the right to plunder and instead increase access to food for all goblins fighting as levies in our army and their families during war, not only will most goblins be happy, but the number of goblins we can raise and support will increase in turn."
 greedy_grin_establish_levy_system_title:0 "Establish the Levy System"
 greedy_grin_establish_levy_system_desc:0 "Other nations pay their armies to sit around and get drunk all day in peacetime - a complete waste of money that no Greedy Grin Clan goblin will ever allow.\n\nInstead, we will implement a levy system that will allow us to quickly raise an army for war and disband it afterwards to continue working in our mines and fields - this will be a great boon in times of peace, yet ensure we still have an effective army in times of war."
 greedy_grin_war_tax_reform_title:0 "War Tax Reform"
 greedy_grin_war_tax_reform_desc:0 "War taxes are a common idea in our clan, yet it takes effort to get people to actually pay them. By allowing our soldiers more of the loot, we can ensure that war taxes are paid less by our subjects -- and more by our conquests -- and make both our soldiers and our people happier."
 greedy_grin_local_levy_stations_title:0 "Local Levy Stations"
 greedy_grin_local_levy_stations_desc:0 "When we collect our levies, we often have to rely on the word of the locals that the number of troops they send is the right one. But thanks to our food system, we now have a clearer picture of any area’s actual population based on its food consumption.\n\nSince many goblins are not fulfilling their duty to fight for us as levies, we will be setting up local levy stations that, along with the food system, will determine the number of levies each province must send. This should give us much larger reserves in war and, since only registered goblins will have access to the food system, an easier time replenishing and reinforcing our troops while being cheaper overall."
 
 # Events
 flavor_greedy_grin.1.t:0 "A Mountain of Gold"
 flavor_greedy_grin.1.d:0 "After the successful conquest of Verkal Gulan, we first had to repair it to gain access to the vaults deep below, but now that we have access and see how much gold there is, we can only marvel. The question now is whether we just take everything or just what we need for our expansion. "
 flavor_greedy_grin.1.a:0 "Take everything"
 flavor_greedy_grin.1.b:0 "...in moderation"
 flavor_greedy_grin.2.t:0 "The Gold Dwarves"
 flavor_greedy_grin.2.d:0 "After our conquest of Verkal Gulan, we never bothered with the rest of the so-called Gold Dwarves we conquered, but it is time we asked ourselves what we are going to do with them. Some advocate killing all who oppose us, which would lead to their near extinction, or enslaving them and using them and their knowledge to mine more gold in the years to come."
 flavor_greedy_grin.2.a:0 "Kill any that resist"
 flavor_greedy_grin.2.b:0 "Enslave them"
 flavor_greedy_grin.3.t:0 "The Sacking of Seghdihr?"
 flavor_greedy_grin.3.d:0 "We have Seghdihr under our control, it's time to decide if we just want to take what we can, which would preserve it better if we want to make it part of Greedy Grin, or really sack it, which would give us more loot now but destroy large parts of it."
 flavor_greedy_grin.3.a:0 "Just take what we can"
 flavor_greedy_grin.3.b:0 "Sack it completely"
 flavor_greedy_grin.4.t:0 "Sacking of Seghdihr"
 flavor_greedy_grin.4.d:0 "Those greedy goblins have conquered our glorious hold and completely looted it, causing huge devastation and loss of dwarven life. We should recapture it as soon as possible and exterminate these goblins. "
 flavor_greedy_grin.4.a:0 "An undying grudge has been born"
 flavor_greedy_grin.5.t:0 "The Citrine Dwarves"
 flavor_greedy_grin.5.d:0 "We have successfully conquered Seghdihr, but unlike the Gold Dwarves, we should make the decision over how to treat them earlier this time, so they can't fight back with their outside allies.\n\nThe question is again, whether we kill them, or force them to pay an additional tax in exchange for good conditions and loyalty."
 flavor_greedy_grin.5.a:0 "Kill any that resist"
 flavor_greedy_grin.5.b:0 "Let them pay an extra tax"
 flavor_greedy_grin.6.t:0 "The Topaz Throne"
 flavor_greedy_grin.6.d:0 "Our army found a throne set with topaz in Gor Ozumbrog. Some of the topazes have been lost, but it is still a great sign of authority that we could use to show the power of our leader. Or, of course, we could sell it for a fortune. "
 flavor_greedy_grin.6.a:0 "Use it"
 flavor_greedy_grin.6.b:0 "Sell it"
 flavor_greedy_grin.7.t:0 "A Mysterious Seal"
 flavor_greedy_grin.7.d:0 "After the capture of Hehodovar, most of our army went in search of valuables left behind. One of these goblins found an empty office containing a mysterious seal, thinking it valuable, he took it as loot.\n\nA few strange reports, however ,soon brought it to the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The seal seems to have some strange power that makes decrees or orders all but impossible to disobey. We must watch it closely and make sure that it cannot be used by the wrong goblin."
 flavor_greedy_grin.7.a:0 "But our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is the right goblin!"
 flavor_greedy_grin.8.t:0 "War Time Demands New Innovation"
 flavor_greedy_grin.8.d:0 "Better infrastructure and our new, innovative system of levies are of great benefit to our war capabilities."

 flavor_greedy_grin.9.d:0 "Peacetime investments lead to unprecedented prosperity."
 flavor_greedy_grin.9.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 flavor_greedy_grin.10.t:0 "Cannon Schematics"
 flavor_greedy_grin.10.d:0 "We lost so many to the cannons of Ovdal Kanzad, even if our conquest was successful. Thankfully, with the Cannonhold taken, we can scour their knowledge about cannons, and even adapt several schematics we have discovered."
 flavor_greedy_grin.10.a:0 "Use them"
 flavor_greedy_grin.11.t:0 "The Depths of Gor Vazumbrog"
 flavor_greedy_grin.11.d:0 "After the conquest of Gor Vazumbrog, we discovered several vaults that we initially thought were similarly rich to those of Verkal Gulan, but we discovered that the vaults were constructed quite differently, not so much for defense from the outside as for defense from the inside, which confused many.\n\nWe could open a vault with our gained knowledge and see for ourselves what was kept inside, or use the knowledge we gained to help us with siege work."
 flavor_greedy_grin.11.a:0 "Open it"
 flavor_greedy_grin.11.b:0 "Something feels wrong"
 flavor_greedy_grin.12.t:0 "Defy The Command"
 flavor_greedy_grin.12.d:0 "The Command, having realized that it borders on us, has sent a group of hobgoblins to put us in our place. From their point of view, we are nothing more than subordinates and should become a slave state under their rule. We should show them that their orders have no power over us and we will defeat them. Our levies are already gathering and are in full support for a war against The Command."
 flavor_greedy_grin.12.a:0 "Defy it"
 flavor_greedy_grin.13.t:0 "A Region United"
 flavor_greedy_grin.13.d:0 "We have finally conquered and settled the entire Middle Dwarovar, our home region - a great day for our nation."
 flavor_greedy_grin.13.a:0 "The Middle Dwarovar is ours"
 flavor_greedy_grin.14.t:0 "A Second Capital"
 flavor_greedy_grin.14.d:0 "We have completed the construction of our second capital in Grônstunad. From now on, the affairs of the Eastern Serpentine can be handled there to reduce the pressure on our capital in Verkal Gulan. "
 flavor_greedy_grin.14.a:0 "Its time"
 flavor_greedy_grin.15.t:0 "Greedy Grin Domination"
 flavor_greedy_grin.15.d:0 "Having brought our home region completely under our control and also secured the entire Eastern Serpentspine for our nation, we are truly dominant within the Dwarovar and no nation will be able to stand against us and our wealth."
 flavor_greedy_grin.15.a:0 "We are Dominating"
 flavor_greedy_grin.16.t:0 "Wealth Unimaginable"
 flavor_greedy_grin.16.d:0 "Our gold production is gigantic, our nation is greater than any other in history, our infrastructure is the best in the world, and our wealth is just unimaginable, wealth is really the best."
 flavor_greedy_grin.16.a:0 "We are Unimaginably Wealthy"
 flavor_greedy_grin.17.t:0 "A Lucky Find"
 flavor_greedy_grin.17.d:0 "It has been only a short while now, since we filled our vault and today two different patrols in the two provinces neighbouring our vault happened to find mithril, what a lucky find. The coinluck generated by our vault is surely great, we should quickly set up equipment to mine this extremely rare material."
 flavor_greedy_grin.17.a:0 "Truly lucky!"
