 pasiragha_affirming_our_ties_title:0 "Affirming our Ties"
 pasiragha_affirming_our_ties_desc:0 "Pasiragha is the senapti of the west, whose etymological roots define it literally as the western kingdom. It is our duty to watch the hills, to defend the passes and to see the Raj's will done in the lower highlands and valleys. Yet with our current power base this grows more difficult by the day. Perhaps it is time to solidify our political position, and grow our strength for the good of the Raja."
 pasiragha_develop_port_title:0 "Develop our Principle Port"
 pasiragha_develop_port_desc:0 "Attyhuyaba is now firmly in our hands, and gives us access to the Sea of Rahen - a luxury previously denied to us. With a new port we can more easily attract the scholars and pilgrims that will strengthen our intellectual strength, and bolster our economy. To that end, we must expand the port, our principle port."
 pasiragha_failing_peace_title:0 "The Failing Peace"
 pasiragha_failing_peace_desc:0 "The realm is collapsing. Countless decades of mismanagement, blatent favourtism and rampant corruption has crippled the Raj from within. The empire is barely held together by Raja Manva I, and only then because he refuses to die. It is only a matter of time before the senaptis and prahbis must take their destiny into their own hands. Preparations must be made."
 pasiragha_coast_war_title:0 "War for the Coast"
 pasiragha_coast_war_desc:0 "With the approval of our allies and patrons, the time for war has come. To reclaim the coast for the Raj. A land which has long since rebelled and broken away. The western kingdom shall return those riches to realm at large, and at long last claim a port of our own."
 pasiragha_western_estates_title:0 "The Western Estates"
 pasiragha_western_estates_desc:0 "On our western border lies the lands of Ghabrabhi and Dhurasidheni, the latter of which holds the final resting place of Rama Nar Singh. The value of this land is currently squandered under the current administration. With some proper stewarship, it could be converted into a proper hub of trade and pilgrimage, but first we need to aquire it."
 pasiragha_nar_singh_stupa_title:0 "Rama Nar Singh's Stupa"
 pasiragha_nar_singh_stupa_desc:0 "Upon the an undescript hill, approximately 5 miles west of the High Temple of Dhurasodheni, lies the Stupa of Rama Nar Singh. An ancient monument built in the early 200's dedicated to the philosopher's life and deeds. It has, over the centuries, fallen into disrepair and neglect.\n\nAs part of our plan to attract pilgrims and travellers, we should reviatlize this site."
 pasiragha_ensure_saftey_title:0 "Ensure Pilgrim's Saftey"
 pasiragha_ensure_saftey_desc:0 "Pilgrims are a common site in Rahen, for the only way to see th High Temples is to go there yourself. Sure, there are Brahmkalaas that provide detailed replications of the art works, but they are inheirently flawed - influenced deeply by the views of their makers.\n\nAs the steward of the Hall of Endless debate, and now two diffferent High Temples, it is our duty to protect these pilgrims as they travel our lands. Let us renovate the trails roads and paths."
 pasiragha_future_of_hall_title:0 "The Future of the Hall"
 pasiragha_future_of_hall_desc:0 "Pasiragha is defined by her highlands and more importantly, The Hall of Endless debate. The massive structure has been the center of Rayavashapal for as long as city held any position of importance. Rayavashapal breathes in tune with the coming and going of the philosophers and scholars that tread the paths of that great building. Yet at this moment her future is uncertain..."
 pasiragha_ravanars_plan_title:0 "Ravanar's Plan"
 pasiragha_ravanars_plan_desc:0 "We are currently walking an unknown path. The future before us is uncertain, but Ravanar has a plan. A close advisor to the senapti, and long time military advisor, he has returned from a long trek into the Ghankhaden Highlands. His military venture taught him much about convoy protection and guerilla tactics, and he wants to begin training a cadre of light infantry around this new model."
 pasiragha_defend_interior_title:0 "Defend the Interior"
 pasiragha_defend_interior_desc:0 "With our recent conquests we have finally pushed our borders beyond the immediate surroundings of Rayavashapal. A proposal has been put forward to construct a new band of fortifications around our core territories. Without the threat of immediate seige our farmlands and cities would be able to flourish like never before."
 pasiragha_hall_to_district_title:0 "From Hall to District"
 pasiragha_hall_to_district_desc:0 ""Five more books to be carried out, the door closes and at that moment you are invisible, a ghost in the hall"\n-Saer Halliday\n\nThe hall bustles with activity scholars from all across the Raj come to read and learn. Her libraries grow with new tomes and treatisies, and the ampitheatres are always full - racaus and bold.\n\nWhile the hall did not come from humble beginnings, she has grown to encompass a district. New inns, apartments, homes, and rennovatiosn have spiraled out from her. The veins and arteries of a reviatalized heart beating in the center of Rayavashapal."
 pasiragha_painful_birth_title:0 "Painful is Birth"
 pasiragha_painful_birth_desc:0 "To exist is to search for happiness, to struggle against the suffering of reality, but most do not see this truth. Guru Suhan, an Ascendant Soul philosopher from the Yan river valley has traveled westward to arrive in our place of worship. He bring with him a new doctrine of multipilicity and syncretims. Where paths once spread outwards into the forest of wisdom, Suhans has unified them once again. He has forged a path composed of all, and regardless of his intentions, each step on that new path will be soaked in blood."
 pasiragha_expand_school_title:0 "Expand School Grounds"
 pasiragha_expand_school_desc:0 "Attached to one of the hall's many chambers is the Rayavashapal School of Principles. The school's curicullum is centered on the four tenants of: politics, economics, philosophy, and historical tradition. It has historically been one of the preeminant centers of education and learning, but has lost much of its prestige over the past century. Right now, it is nothing more than a stamp for the elite, practically a vacation destination rather than a school. We must correct this course."
 pasiragha_entice_thinkers_title:0 "Entice Future Thinkers"
 pasiragha_entice_thinkers_desc:0 "A rennovated school is nothing without teachers and students. Most philosophers within Rayavashapal would rather spend their days debating within the hall or ruminanting their hour away within High Temples and small cells. We must provide incentives for them to teach, perhaps even make it a requirement that some of their lectures and arguments take place on school grounds. Then we can begin the hard work of attracting the students of the next generation."
 pasiragha_broadening_scope_title:0 "Broadening Our Scope"
 pasiragha_broadening_scope_desc:0 "Avhavubhiya now overflows with goods and trade ships unloading their cargo and pilgrims. A fair number of these travellers come from far away lands, amd a few have even graced The Hall with their presence. The debate halls have never been livlier, and many of our philosophers nwo request that we encourage this exchange of ideas and people; we must bring them in from far and wide."
 pasiragha_gulf_bases_title:0 "Securing Bases in the Gulf"
 pasiragha_gulf_bases_desc:0 "While the western approaches to Avhavubhiya are relatively well defended and patrolled, the waters of the east to the south of Bhuvari are rife with piracy. Massive fleats to raids shorelines and assail merchants, and even Vangham sometimes serves as a base for these cutthroats. In order to secure safe passage from the east we must put a stop to this plague.  First, we will need to secure some new forward bases for our fleets."
 pasiragha_convoy_security_title:0 "Convoy Security"
 pasiragha_convoy_security_desc:0 "With a proper base in Houdoduwo, we can bring our campaign against the pirates to its rightful conclusion. To the south east are their primary bases within Hoangdesinh, but more importantly, they hold several islands within the Ringlet chain. If we do not flush them from their hiding places on those jungle islands, they will merely raise new forces and strike once again. The Ringlet Isles must come under our control."
 pasiragha_colonial_truth_title:0 "Spreading Truth"
 pasiragha_colonial_truth_desc:0 "Across the Gulf of Rahen, on the northern shore of Sarhal, is the land of the Mengi. A people's whose coastline has for many years slowly come under the control of various Raheni merchant republics. Yet, they are poor stewards of this land. The native peoples who follow our faith are given some degree of special treatment sure, but there is little to no effort to protect them.\n\nAs the rightful ruler of the western Raj, it our duty to step in, and take control of this situation."
 pasiragha_inter_school_coop_title:0 "Inter-School Cooperation"
 pasiragha_inter_school_coop_desc:0 "While High Philosophy appears to be a united faith, in practice many of the schools hold diametically opposed beliefs from one another. Golden Palace, Ascendant Soul, and Starry Eye scholars constantly butt heads over the nature of atma and whether or not visatama exists at all. Even in that microcosm of metaphysical disagreement, one can see that the cracks run deep. Yet, it is our duty as the steward of the Hall to bring them together. To permit them a co-operative enviornment, even if it is bound solely to the confines of our great building. A commitment we must uphold to a higher degree as the reformation rages about us."
 pasiragha_promote_residents_title:0 "Promote Residents"
 pasiragha_promote_residents_desc:0 "The scholars, theologians, and philosophers who visit the Hall have increasingly begun to put down roots. Many bring their whole families with them when they arrive in port. While officially this practice is discouraged, no one has enforced any of the regulations so long as they can fend for themselves. As a result, within Avhavubhiya and Rayavashapal, there has been a growth of immigrant districts where the crafts and customs of their homes shine through in food, goods, and architectue. While there is a vocal minority which condems the foreigners, most city officials see them as a positive windfall and have even brought forward a proposal to expand this district and provide official recognition."
 pasiragha_exilarchs_modest_proposal_title:0 "The Exilarch's Proposal"
 pasiragha_exilarchs_modest_proposal_desc:0 "Fires have burned down several districts in our major cities, and we are now left to pick up the pieces. However, the source of the problem, immigrant communities that lie outside of the caste system still remains. Finding a way to integrate them into our society has become a hotly debated question. Yet one answer has come to the surface: perhaps the new outsiders could be guided by the old outsiders.\n\nThe Exilarch has long been the leader of the dwarves in exile, awaiting a day that they may return to their ancestral homeland. Historically, we have had an excellent relationship with the Exilarch. Perhaps we could officially bring him into our government? Provide him a position of authority, and allow him to be the voice for all who lie outside of the caste system."
 pasiragha_battle_of_will_title:0 "The Battle of Will"
 pasiragha_battle_of_will_desc:0 "The reformation is a battle fought on many fronts, not just in the Hall or the battlefield, but also in the hearts and minds of rulers. For it is the ruling castes which enforce doctrine and will upon their subjects. The Senapti posseses a unique position given the starting point of the reformation, perhaps they can win over some hearts and minds with the pen instead of the sword?"
 pasiragha_upgrade_paths_title:0 "Upgrade the Paths"
 pasiragha_upgrade_paths_desc:0 "With most of the Ghankhaden Highlands under our control, we can begin to extend our trails and roads through the mountains and hills. Dhakilamvi will serve as the next terminus. It is there that Rama Nar Singh's teaching on atma were fully syncretized into High Philosophy within the old governor's palace in 146. While we pave new roads, we should also take the time to invest in the old infastructure. Engineering has come quite a ways since the first paths were laid in dirt and stone and they are due for an upgrade."
 pasiragha_new_dogma_title:0 "A New Dogma"
 pasiragha_new_dogma_desc:0 "The strife of the past few years has finally come to a close, and a new Pasiragha has emerged from the chaos. A new dogma has been forged, and it is her duty as the steward of the Hall to spread that doctrine near and far. Preparations must be made, for the battle for the purtara of a nation has begun."
 pasiragha_western_authority_title:0 "Authority in the West"
 pasiragha_western_authority_desc:0 "We have positioned ourself as the true western authority when it comes to matters of High Philosophy. We have spread our doctrine throughout the land by word and sword. Our spiritual authority is unquestioned. Now all that is left to do, is to solidify this position. Hence, like the philosophers of centuries past, we will organize a council."
 pasiragha_legacy_of_reformation_title:0 "Legacy of the Reformation"
 pasiragha_legacy_of_reformation_desc:0 "Suhan has come and gone, his bones returned to the soil, but his faith has not perished, nor has its followers. His disciples still spread his message far and wide, and philosophers of the traditional schools follow them at every turn. Yet, for the everyday person, things have settled down. The wars are over, and historians have begun to properly look at the events that took place these past decades. A legacy has been laid down by our hand, but the question is, what will history think of us?"
 pasiragha_unity_of_spirit_land_title:0 "Unity of Land and Spirit"
 pasiragha_unity_of_spirit_land_desc:0 "We stand at a prescipice. Our goals were never purley of conquest, yet that is the machine we have created, and it is clear that the Raj is collapsing. It has been for some time now.\n\nWe have the heart and soul of the old Raj in our hands and it yearns to be reunited with the body once more, to become one with the empire, and to stear her towards better days. It is time for us to assume the mantle of the Raj."
 pasiragha_battle_of_body_title:0 "The Battle of Body"
 pasiragha_battle_of_body_desc:0 "War is coming, and Pasiragha is not ready. We have trained men into small elite units, not into massive formations, yet the latter is what will be necessary to survive in this age of reformation. While Ravanar's light infantry tactics have been massively successful on the small scale, we will have to pick and choose the parts of that doctrine which are imparted onto the average soldier. A new curriculum focusing intense march drills through rocky terrain will provide our troops an edge in quickly closing the gap between retreating forces. We will strike quickly and melt away before we can be pinned by bloody costly engagements."
 pasiragha_ofehbi_freedom_title:0 "Ofehibi Philosophers"
 pasiragha_ofehbi_freedom_desc:0 "While our philosophy has been spread to the communities of the Srahal coast, there are still those within the interior who share our views. Small communities within Mewojala, Simegesfan and Mewomender still follow the wisdom of the High Gods and should be placed under our protection.\n\nThe big question within government circles is how? While we could begin carving a path into the interior of the continent, such a war would surely be expensive, so perhaps a diplomatic solution is more appropriate. The Raja will have the final say on the matter."
 pasiragha_farther_afield_title:0 "Ideas from Farther Afield"
 pasiragha_farther_afield_desc:0 "Each day our grasp widens and encompases more peoples and new ideas. Yet there are still those beyond our reach. There are stories of peoples from beyond the deserts of Bulwar that follow a rational philosophy, and even further still tales of a people in Alecand who hold a unique philosophy of government.\n\nLike all peoples they are welcome to the Hall, but we have to get them here first. A series of naval bases around the southern coast of Sarhal would provide our fleets the necessary range such that we may begin making inroads."
 pasiragha_simralka_title:0 "Restore the Simralka"
 pasiragha_simralka_desc:0 "The Simralka ultimately served as the center for a philosophical renaissance within Keyattordha. While it would take Rama Nar Singh nearly half a decade to attract a meaningful following, the Simralka would thereafter support him for almost the entire second half of his life. Situated on what is now known as the Phulaandgara, the original school was little more than a small collection of furniture, and a single stone pavilion. The Simralka would grow over the next two decades to consist of two lecture halls, a debate room, sleeping quarters for Rama Nar Singh and other philosophers. Nowadays the site is an old ruin, barely noticeable through the greenery and centuries of sediment build up, but this is something we can fix."
 pasiragha_joint_expedition_title:0 "A Joint Expedition"
 pasiragha_joint_expedition_desc:0 "The Exilarch has brought forward an interesting proposition. There are many dwarves within our realm who still wish more than anything else to return to the mountains of their ancestors. For most of history this has seemd like little more than a pipe dream pushed by small adventuring bands, but with the recources of the Raj, this might just be possible. The Exilarch's plan is to set up a joint expeditionary board which would manage Grozumdhir under the protection of the Raj. He would serve as their representative within the Raj while any who did not wish to live under the new system would be free to move to the new dwarven home. All he needs now is approval."
 pasiragha_lessons_of_gov_title:0 "Lessons of Governance"
 pasiragha_lessons_of_gov_desc:0 "Pasiragha has benefitted greatly from the scholars and philosophers we have brought into our borders over the past centuries, and many have identified issues within our government. While most of those criticisms come from a place of ignorance (especially in regards to the caste system) some do make valid points. In particular our legistlative body is an antiquated relic of our days under the old Raj's thumb. Once the realm is sufficiently stable, we can begin to implement some of these suggestions. The real question is a matter of whose vision we follow."
 pasiragha_restore_visatama_title:0 "Restore Visatama"
 pasiragha_restore_visatama_desc:0 "We have been the beating heart and beacon of reason of the Raj for some time now. Yet now, we possess the body as well. A body mistreated over decades as rich corrupt men carved her into pieces - little fiefdoms for their own enrichment. The whole of her form is akin to a corpse, and the work to repair the damage will be immense, but it is a task we must undertake for the good of all within her lands, such that all may reach purtara."
 pasiragha_integrate_roads_title:0 "Integrate the Road Networks"
 pasiragha_integrate_roads_desc:0 "The road networks of the Raj are a mess. While our core territories have standardized templates and consistent engineering, much of the territory we now rule is a patchwork of local dirt paths, the glorious remains of the Golden Highway, and antiquated streets. A key part of our reformation efforts is to incorporate all of these disparate networks together into a cohesive whole. The effort will be immense, and the standardization process is excepted to take decades, but the rewards for our commerce, communication, and military would be incalculable."
 pasiragha_answering_questions_title:0 "Answering the Question"
 pasiragha_answering_questions_desc:0 "An empire has been forged from a single city in the highlands of the western mountains. The western kingdom has become a Raja on par with all but one of her incarnations. The enemies which threatened our existance have been defeated, philosophers are freed from binds, and countless peoples have been shown the wisdom of our doctrines. The Hall bustles with new ideas and new peoples, and our horizon is ever expanding.\n\nMore importantly, we have changed. Pasiragha is no longer the small military governorship of her youth. We have syncretized and integrated ideas and beliefs from cultures around the world. Each of them has left marks on the realm and how we function. The question now stands of who left the biggest mark."
 pasiragha_bury_hatchet_title:0 "Bury the Hatchet"
 pasiragha_bury_hatchet_desc:0 "Bhuvari broke free from the Raj centuries ago. It has grown to become a highly defined culture of its own built on, but seperate from, our own. Many Raja's have tried and failed to conquer its people and subjugate them under the Raj once more. Most doubt Pasiragha would be any different in this respect. Yet there is another way - a path to peace.\n\nIt will not be easy, and will require sacrifice, but a lasting peace would truly be an achievement worth boasting about for generations to come. Will we try to bury the hatchet?"
 pasiragha_secure_wall_title:0 "Secure the Godswall"
 pasiragha_secure_wall_desc:0 "The Godswall is one of High Philosophy's most holy sites. The High Temples and old carvings suggest that it was built by the High God Prathim and then later added to by man. The massive structure of statues and temples stretches towards the heavens, reaching towards the Ascension Plateau. Sadly, it has been under the control of The Command for some time now; it has been left to languish and decay without any care.\n\nWith the Raj stablized we can push back and retake that which was taken from all of High Philosophy. The North will fall under the rule of the Raj once more."
