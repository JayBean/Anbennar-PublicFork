 precursor_relicsDESC:0 "Before the rediscovery of Aelantir, the disparate trinkets and artefacts of the past were a mistery across most of the world. But, with the Age of Unraveling, these relics came to be commonly known as the last remnants of the world-spanning empire of the Precursor elves. \n\nDisplaying an unrivaled magical prowess that far surpasses our own capabilities, these curios are keys to the past and blueprints for the future."

 precursor_relics.1.t:0 "Precursor Ruins Discovered"
 precursor_relics.1.d:0 "While we'd not thought much of [This.GetName]'s hinterland, it seems that the hubris of our dismissal had been a grave mistake. Recent surveying efforts in the region have revealed a mysterious ancient and exquisitely designed, further inspection dating it back to the time of the Precursors. \n\nA few of our people have had to be taught the lesson of not sticking every unknown object one finds in an ancient ruin into their pockets, the site has mostly been secured to prevent any further incidents of theft or injuries from the often-volatile properties of these relics. Our experts are at the ready, primed to set up a proper dig and delve if the word is given. Should we see to it that these items are secured and put to proper use?"
 precursor_relics.1.a:0 "Send them in, and secure the site!"
 precursor_relics.1.b:0 "Just throw the dirt back over it, it's too much trouble."
 
 precursor_relics.2.t:0 "Relics Dwindling"
 precursor_relics.2.d:0 "Our historians estimate that the Precursor Elves must have held the world for thousands of years... And, yet, it seems that simply wasn't enough time to leave the amount of relics that the world now clamors for. The ruin in [This.GetName] has proved bountiful and illuminating. Our crew on the ground has brought us concerning news, however. The site is growng barer by the day, our digs moving further and further from the exhausted abundance of the site's center. \n\nThis isn't the end, but we can hear rumblings that the site may soon be exhausted."
 precursor_relics.2.a:0 "Make hay while the sun shines."
 
 precursor_relics.3.t:0 "Relics Depleted"
 precursor_relics.3.d:0 "Looking terribly sheepish, the leaders of our excavation at the Precursor ruins in [This.GetName] have come knocking with the most unfortunate news. Though they've kept digging for weeks now, they've yet to turn up more than a pittance of pottery, a few loose bones, and enough worms to give a small city's worth of people a nice fishing trip. Simply put, the ruin is ruined. We've picked it clean of anything valuable, turned every stone, and used it to the last. \n\nUnfortuantely, it seems our investments in the province will have to be redirected to some other industry. Let's hope we can muster something to give even a fraction of the relics' worth."
 precursor_relics.3.a:0 "You can make history, but you can't make more history."
 
 precursor_relics.4.t:0 "Precursor Relics Shortage"
 precursor_relics.4.d:0 "Previously the domain of a few cloistered scholars in far-flung corners of the world, and hardly worthy of note outside the tales of particularly prestigious items such as the blade Calindal, the neglect precursor relics has finally come to an end. With the widespread awareness of their utiltiy, a permanent trade in these curios of the past has been established for years now, and is quickly transforming these items from a valuable commodity to a rarity. \n\nMany of the first and most noteworthy deposits of relics have begun to run dry, and the world has begun to scramble for new sources. This however, has been quite a profitable panic, as the trade has only become more lucrative in recent months, and should only grow more profitable from here."
 precursor_relics.4.a:0 "Great news!"
 
 precursor_relics.5.t:0 "Precursor Relics Shortage"
 precursor_relics.5.d:0 "While the world has for some time now been aware of the depletion of precursor sites, such news has become more common and pronounced, with sites in all four corners of the world being greatly diminished, or exhausted entirely. Though some sites had been mostly inaccessible, and helped to alleviate this anxiety, the climbing prices have made even the most remote deposits viable. \n\nIt's clear the world will soon see the peak of its supply, as the squabbles between the historians, mages, and artificers who all wish to put the relics to their own ends grow more bitter and acrid. Though the prices are still rising, giving a boon to the state, its clear that soon, most everyone will simply have to make do without relics."
 precursor_relics.5.a:0 "...Great news?"
 
 precursor_relics.6.t:0 "Relics of the Past"
 precursor_relics.6.d:0 "This obsession with digging up the past to chart our future seems like it soon may be a thing of the past. Only the grandest or most remote ruins still continue to yield relics of the precursors' empire, with many of their finer examples long since broken down for study, or confined to the collections of those who simply refuse to be bribed for them, or are too powerful for unseemly folk to pilfer from. Most every self-respecting mage or artificer would give almost anything to get their hands on these relics, but even the wealthiest among them struggle to secure more than a pittance of useless baubles for their efforts. \n\nThose lucky few who hold the coinpurses for the remaining excavations will doubtlessly be endowed with abundant, vulgar wealth. The question remains, though, how long until the foundations of their buisnesses have become as much a relic as those artefacts?"
 precursor_relics.6.a:0 "Not so great news..."
 
 precursor_relics.9.t:0 "Precursor Relics"
 precursor_relics.9.d:0 "In years past, Precursor Relics had been nothing but a curiosity, their origin veiled in mystery, the power they contained stunning and inexplicable. Fortunately, with the rediscovery of Aelantir and the formalized study and interest in them, a greater understanding has grown and spread through all the world. With a contextualization of these items in the history of the Precursor Elves' empire, they are now merely stunning and nearly inexplicable. \n\nStretching the limits of magical possibility, these common items blow past the finest mages and tinkerers alike in their ability to provide solutions to problems. At least, when we can figure out what exactly they were for. Whether for their brilliant applications of known principles, strange effects that are contradcitory to our understanding of the natural world and laws of magic, or simply the prestige of holding the legacy of the world's greatest empire, the price of these relics has lit the markets ablaze. \n\nMore importantly, it will put those who control the relics in the perfect position to part the world's political and intellectual elite with an exhorbitant amount of money."
