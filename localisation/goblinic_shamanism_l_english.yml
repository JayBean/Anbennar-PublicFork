 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.2.d:0 "Of the many peoples we allied or subjugated one follows a faith from the West which believes the gods don't interfere directly in the mortal plane, but instead use 'avatars' to execute their will in the world. Despite these people clearly not understanding theology (as everyone can see their 'Dame' and 'Castellos' are but aspects of our moon-goddess), some of our people have begun to take over this idea."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.3.d:0 "The gnomes value intelligence over all else. They pay homage to neither gods nor spirits, preferring to develop an understanding of the physical world. A group of our shamans have donned gnomish thinking caps and now demand recognition as the Cult of Reason. They have begun debating, experimenting, and recording every major and minor discovery they have made. While they are eccentric even by goblin standards and the majority of their findings have been useless at best, occasionally they produce actionable ideas."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.4.d:0 "The dwarves we have conquered seem to possess a strange way of venerating their ancestors.

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.20.d:0 "We currently find ourselves forging ties with a realm still venerating the oldest of all gods: Grandmother Earth, the first being who stepped out of the primordial chaos and mother of uncountable gods. She is so old she has more names (ranging from Teerdi to Soilide) than any other deity.\n\nMillennia ago our people were thrown out of their original underground homes and dismissed her as but a minor god as she failed to help them, but perhaps our ancestors should have given her a second chance, as they did for their later gods."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.21.d:0 "Recently some of our people have come back from listening to the herdsmen of a nearby country: they now say we don't give enough veneration to the lord of the sky. According to the herdsmen, they visited he's one of the most important spirits being the father of all stars, the maker of clouds, the bringer of rain, and the ruler of the Milkyway."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.22.d:0 "Today we were visited by traders from one of our neighboring countries. They claim that their nation considers the sun to be the most powerful and clever of all gods, despite being imprisoned by her sister. They claim the many contradictions in our mythologies are caused by her plots, which can span centuries, and that someday she'll succeed in breaking free and take back her rightful place as ruler of all stars beginning an age that shall be named after the metal of the sun, gold.\n\nShe previously already helped the mortals by spreading the arts of medicine and shamanism and now is using her schemes to prepare the conquest of Earth by our kind."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.23.t:0 "Muta Mestika"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.23.d:0 "Our shamans tell us of an old goddess, who is newly demanding attention. Mother Moon: The goddess of justice and rulership. According to the exodus goblins, she became the current head of the pantheon, after overthrowing her older sister and forcing her to become the sun by chaining her to a flying chariot. It is said she only speaks in puns and double entendres, regarded by learned shamans as the highest form of poetry."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.24.d:0 "Even a goblin child knows Guard Thunder, whether or not he's known as Blexim or Eragurd in our realm: He's the morning star who circles the sun to fight against the hordes of evil spirits, who want to kidnap her, with his lightning arrows.\n\nHowever some know him as much more: according to traveling fanatics he once liberated the other gods known by our people from slavery by the evil deity followed by the brutish orcs, 'Great Dookan', when Dookan was distracted fighting other gods.\n\nNow he's fighting both Dookan and the other gods alien to our kind, and he's calling on his followers to help him by fighting their henchmen on Earth."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.24.a:0 "Wait, he claims our gods once were enslaved by Dookan? That's heresy!"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.25.t:0 "Vortza Lesa"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.25.d:0 "A shaman has returned from a quest into the woods with a profound appreciation of Vortza Lesa, Lady Forest, and would demand we all pay her equal respect. She is mainly seen as a mediator between goblinkind and all the forest spirits, but the forest goblins in the Deepwoods go much further and see her as the personification of all nature and thus the only deity worthy of worship"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.26.t:0 "Vortzo Laukuno"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.26.d:0 "A farmer tending the fields has had a vision and been welcomed by the shamans as one of their own because of the profundity of her vision. She brings with her teachings of Vortzo Laukuno, Lord Agriculture: He isn't normally regarded as an important god in goblin culture, however, an exception to the rule is the Exodus Goblins with whom he has highly risen in rank after their conquest of fertile agricultural regions. Thanks to a deal between the gods he only has to spend a third of the year in the underworld, so he can spend the rest of the year with his wife the forest goddess, above ground. The time he spends in the underworld is generally referred to as 'winter'."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.26.a:0 "A god for farmers? What next a god for bakers?"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.27.t:0 "Vortza Krpa"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.27.d:0 "A weaver fell into a trance while at a loom, and when he emerged, he had created an incredible picture of Vortz Krpa, Lady Cloth. This omen certainly means we will have to pay her respect in the future. She is, after all, the goddess of weaving, trade, and many other crafts. As the daughter of Strahllena and Blexim, she was raised by the other gods who tossed her around like a hot potato. However, this allowed her to learn many trades. She ended up marrying Wezariff for business reasons. (i.e. in exchange for him to stop constantly robing her.)"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.28.t:0 "Zvaiko Udenzo"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.28.d:0 "There have always been a few outcasts in goblin society who worship 'controversial' gods, however amongst the privateers employed by our government this is becoming commonplace: They have started to follow the rogue star, the pirate under the gods, 'Lord Water' himself. Whilst they justify this by claiming he committed great services to the world in his fights against sea monster, this nonetheless disturbs the more conservative of our population."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.28.a:0 "Fascinating..."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.29.t:0 "Zvaika Kirba"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.29.d:0 "A half-drowned goblin, after the water was pumped from her lungs, has shared with our shamans the conversation she had while drowning with the god Star Water. A rogue star, when the other gods were busy fighting each other, he carved out his own domain in the seas, he was wounded in the fighting and now wears an eye patch and has a wooden leg. He acts as the protector of pirates and fishers. It is also believed he causes floods when he's drunk, so it is forbidden to sacrifice alcohol to him."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.29.a:0 "We shall not sacrifice alcohol, and instead will drink it all!"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.30.t:0 "Vortzo Liezmo"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.30.d:0 "A searing fire has torn through a small hut on the outskirts of [Root.Capital.GetName]. The only survivor is a small child, whose eyes have been seared red, and speaks only of Vortzo Liezmo, Lord Fire. As the god of fire, furnaces, and industry, he is the protector of smiths and the miners who supply them with their material. It is said that he managed to trick Kroozmuta Zemna into allowing those who plundered the Earth, her realm, into the good parts of the afterlife. This makes him highly regarded among cave goblin miners."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.31.d:0 "A rouge scout rode into our city. The goblin told us of the great broodmother: Muta Kroozpauz. The Spiderqueen of us all, her realm being spiders and everything they produce. Worship is through consumption of venombrew, living in silk and spreading her realm. How fascinating."

But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has a much better idea that listening to their advisors' disparate voices — why not reach out to the clan's founders, to be certain we are following in their footsteps? The shamans prepare a ritual at once, and the only question is what kind of spirit we should reach out for..."

Your daughter has also taken a keen interest in the war, studying warfare alongside her religious education.\n\nOne night, the court's storyteller retells the story of how Muta Mestika once led the divine army against the demons. Your daughter listens, transfixed. She later approaches you requesting to fight our enemies."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.50.a:0 "Go! With the wisdom of the goddess, the enemies of [Root.GetName] shall tremble before you."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.51.d:0 "Maintaining marriage bonds with other countries has helped [Root.GetName] diplomatically and in a recent meeting with the ruler of such an ally, you also discussed the spiritual significance of the bonds of marriage.\n\nThe ruler and many ambassadors were followers of Vortza Lesa and knew our god as Vortza Lesa's consort Vortzo Laukuno. You took this opportunity to speak to them about the importance of our god as a medium to the divine and the bringer of prosperity. Your words seemed to sink in and their leaders now have a better understanding of our faith as well as the value of our royal marriage."

Because of the de-escalation, a new tradition has emerged for the festival.

In later years, Bayvek and Celmaldor would operate as a factional bloc in the Northern League's parliament, finding allies as minority groups marginalized by Gawedi hegemony. \n\nCulturally, this manifested as a tradition known as Silver Shamanism, wherein goblins would adopt elven magics and language, as well as material traditions such as architecture and styles of craft. The practice was considered endearing enough to warrant the aid of the more progressive segments of elven society. Elves, either for pragmatic convenience or out of sincere admiration for their little imitators, offer consultancy and obscure techniques in industry and warfare in exchange for the numbers and technological innovation that goblins could provide in return, each party shoring up the other's relative weaknesses."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.404.a:0 "We are more together than apart."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.405.t:0 "Sun Cult Introduced"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.405.d:0 "The elves and humans of Bulwar have several different religions, but all those religions are kind of the same religion. They all worship light and the sun, whether they call it Surakel or Surael. Then again, the sun is undeniably very powerful, she is one of our own gods as well after all. The humans and elves don’t understand us when we talk about Tewanka Sunka, however, so some of our shamans have taken it upon themselves to set up a separate, more outward-facing cult for Aunt Sun. To properly integrate these humans and elves and whoever into her worship, they have incorporated many of the themes and ideas from the existing Bulwari religions."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.405.a:0 "For Surakel or Surael or whatever you call them!"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.406.t:0 "Gerudian Cult"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.406.d:0 "We first heard their songs during the raids from their ships. Many goblins took to the melodies long before we even knew what they meant, but with more interactions with the giant northmen, more and more goblins began to be swayed.\n\nYou would not expect goblins to have much in common with those giantbloods of the north, and in fact, some might say we still don't. Even with a slow conversion of some of the population over to Skaldhyrric cults, their practices are usually slightly warped from the original intentions. There are many of our folk who immediately took to the stories, their intentions, and the legend and history behind them. They realized the stories of Skalds keeping a dragon chained in sleep suspiciously connected with their legends of chaining a dragon in the Serpentspine. Many more, however, just liked how they sounded.\n\nGoblin skalds, for the most part, care less about the meaning of the words and more about how the melodies and sounds make you feel. Processions of Troubadors are loud, booming, colorful, and fun. When a goblin skald does focus on the lyrics more than the music, there is a tendency to twist the tale a bit. There are many stories spreading through our country that are very suspiciously like the tales of the northmen, but with names changed to the skald's grandfather."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.406.a:0 "My dad was a Reaver you know."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.407.t:0 "Dookan Cult Introduced"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.407.d:0 "Across our history, the relationship between orcs and goblins has been contentious, to say the least. Since the Greentide, however, we have been less cramped up in small spaces with them, and have been more able to observe them from a distance rather than be hunted and enslaved by them. In their zealous worship of Dookan, be it the old one or the new one, they are driven to extraordinary feats in battle. One group of shamans has decided it would be worth it to make some effort to keep him on our good side, through rituals where goblins act like orcs, so that we may achieve similar things during warfare."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.407.a:0 "Waaaaagh!"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.408.t:0 "The Hunt"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.408.d:0 "When it first happened, it was just in passing. The harpies came, and they hunted the plains and trees. The goblins hid. The goblins watched. They watched the harpies hunt and seek and find what they were looking for. Always something different, but always something they valued. The goblins had long hunted too. A home. Safety. A meal. But it wasn't their life, not like the harpies. The goblins then started to hunt more. To find what they wanted, what they sought. And this time, the harpies watched. They watched as the goblins sought, with greater fervor. They watched as what once was simply a hunt became THE Hunt, the Goblin Gods and all their shamans hunting with them. For the goblins now found something. They found their Hunt. And the harpies were Hunting with them."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.408.a:0 "For now we hunt as one."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.409.t:0 "Our Way to Keep the Fey at Bay"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.409.d:0 "While the forest goblins had inhabited the Deepwoods since time immemorial, their dealings with the fey had historically gone poorly. The two peoples had initially formed a pact, the goblins of the Deepwoods having agreed to serve the fey. But, whether it was the capricious nature of the fey, in the weaving of some intolerable bargain, or the greed of the goblins, their agreement was broken, goblins and fey descending into a war of spiteful tricks.\n\nRather than deepening, however, these grudges grew ancient and stale, the malice behind the mischief long forgotten. Beginning beneath the serene boughs of Ahain, the River Grove, the elves' wisdom shared in fleeting moments of peace helped to mend what was broken. Though they failed to embrace the delicate dance of ritual and appeasement between the Wood Elves and the fey, a very Goblin solution prevailed.\n\nEvery village would name a Feykeeper, an unfortunate scapegoat stuck with the short end of every bargain with the fey. Forced to live in ramshackle huts far beyond the borders of the village, these much-maligned wise folk serve as intermediaries between their people and the spirits of the Deepwoods."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.409.a:0 "Keep the Fey Away"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.410.t:0 "The Cult of Paper"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.410.d:0 "Our shamans have observed Raheni society with great interest. Their social order is extremely rigid, with a strong bureaucratic workforce that writes down every last law, statute, and correspondence. A group of shamans has now established the cult of paper to emulate this level of record-keeping. In order to increase efficiency and social cohesion, they have ensured that the language is complicated enough that most goblins will have trouble making sense of any of it. Beyond that, they have also established a system of strategically losing and sometimes finding records whenever it’s in the best interest of the social order and themselves."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.410.a:0 "I’m filing a complaint."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.411.t:0 "The Emptiness"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.411.d:0 "Contact with other races is never a pleasant affair, but contact with giantkin is beyond uncomfortable. Trade caravans passing through their lands often return with fewer goblins than they left with, paying tolls of blood and meat just to get by with their goods intact. One party had left with a shaman on it to potentially negotiate peace with the locals, strapped with goods and supplies ready to feed a goblin for a hundred days, and if lucky a small group of ogres for a tenth of that time. What returned was... unsettling.\n\nThe shaman returned bearing eyes as black as pitch, his body distended and bloated, his mouth dripping with monstrous blood that was not his own. His companions were gone, and the flesh of ogres was present in his cart, a single corpse with a torn open stomach being the most complete one there. \n\nThe shaman was and remains a gibbering mess, speaking of an endless maw that called him to eat and eat and eat, consuming his very being with a maddening emptiness. Shockingly, a cult has formed around this madman, attracting the ravenous hunger of both the mad and the hedonistic alike."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.411.a:0 "I'm so hungry..."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.412.t:0 "Ride Forwards"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.412.d:0 "A noted leader of the Spiderwretch clan was captured weeks ago by a battalion of beastmen in a slaver ambush. Today that leader has returned, changed, and with a flame in their heart so powerful it could be seen through their eyes. They spoke a word to no one for days and were seen staring out at the endless plains of the centaurs almost longingly. This was how they were before they disappeared once more.\n\nA battle occurred just recently. An expeditionary force of goblins hoping to reclaim the depths of a local shanty town were met with an assault by our own feral kin, led by a familiar general at the back of a massive spider. Our feral kinsmen followed the general's commands and cries with a fervor unnatural to goblins, riding forward on spiders fuelled by the promise of a glorious afterlife. The ensuing battle leveled the town and left hundreds dead, along with the general.\n\nThough dead, he remains immortal, with war-dogs and spider jockeys charging in his name before crashing into glorious combat, fighting to enter that same glorious afterlife that they and their shamans--the survivors of that great battle--wished to enter."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.412.a:0 "We Ride to War!"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.413.t:0 "A Goblins Hoard"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.413.d:0 "To the goblins, the kobolds were an interesting people. Like them, they stood in a hostile land surrounded by invaders who had come to retake their land, but unlike them, they were driven by a strong religious and social urge that united them all, HOARDING. This concept of eternal greed for riches was quite familiar to goblins, but the display of it in massive piles was entirely new… and enticing. If goblinkind was to borrow this idea however they were going to do it their way, not through private hoards within their homes but through massive displays available for all to see. The shamans would accept the "donations" and in turn, keep a running tally of everyone’s hoards and guarantee bragging rights to any goblin that wishes to flaunt his wealth."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.413.a:0 "Easier to Track it all that way."
 
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.414.t:0 "The Holiest Shape"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.414.d:0 "Yet another faith from the west has newly arisen, only this one has been even more prominent than the rise of Corin prior. The Ravelian emissary trying to convert us to his faith claims that there is only one true God, and that all other gods are merely aspects or saints of this god, and they speak unto their followers in the form of the God Fragment. When one of our diplomats asked to see what the God Fragment looked like, the emissary looked confused. When pressed further they attempted to describe it. After hour of back and forth, we decided to call it a cube and move on.\n\nAlthough the idea of a single true God is ridiculous, as we know for a fact that there are dozens of our gods, a certain group of Goblins now believe that the cube must be the holiest shape in the universe. Cube cultists have begun constructing buildings and statues made entirely of cubic blocks, as well as creating the images of themselves and their gods, representing what they believe to be their most ideal forms, for to be a cube is to be closer to God."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.414.a:0 "Is there anything going on that isn't about boxes!?"
 
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.415.t:0 "Goblin Soul"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.415.d:0 "For thousands of years, Goblins have been forced to serve and fight the orcs, who would enslave and kill our people for the sake of their imprisoned god Dookan. This is why it’s come as a surprise when we’ve discovered that Orcs have recently not only abandoned the worship of their god, but have accepted him as dead, believing that he left unto orcs the “orcish soul” and that one can be reincarnated with it, and those can eventually become Bulgu, a kind of orcish hero that they sing about.\n\nOf course, this means that Dookan has been slain by one of our own gods, which is a truly pleasing end to that which tormented us for so long. Many shamans believe that Dookan’s slayer has passed down pieces of Dookan’s remaining soul to the goblins, and those with the “goblin soul” have been attempting absolutely outrageous feats just to be considered “heroes'', all to maybe get a nice song made for them from a shaman. Though most merely die stupid deaths, there have already been a few who have been seen as heroic enough to be immortalized in song by our shamans, and these songs are really rather nice to listen to, and they help our people feel more proud of our history and what we are capable of."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.415.a:0 "Now let me sing the song of my people!"
 
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.416.t:0 "Grobilazk the Twisted"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.416.d:0 "The dwarves seemed to have rediscovered their old pantheon from before their empire fell. Hidden among these silly dwarven gods we have discovered something very interesting. Their stories refer to an entity known as Grobilazk the Twisted who, after discovering that Halanna (an obvious copy of Kroozuta Zemna) had created dwarves, grew jealous and stole the gifts of Joztralanna, using a stone and a cave chameleon to create us goblins from his own Image. Though usually a loner, Grobilazk was a very intelligent trickster, bestowing unto us the same intellect and ingenuity that have allowed us to survive in this world, before eventually going on to create the bugbears and hobgoblins to prove his power over the dwarves.\n\nThe dwarves spoke ill of Grobilazk, considering him to be a dirty trickster who plagued them with our presence for thousands of years, but they are clearly jealous of this god’s sheer creativity for creating a race as wonderful as goblins. It is obvious then that many shamans have already taken to spreading the name and teachings of Grobilazk the Twisted, for his existence has not only finally given us a creator god, but also explains our natural intellect and cunning. Shamans of Grobilazk teach that we were created to dominate the dwarves and to be his instrument of mischief across the world, encouraging us to create wild contraptions and perform diabolical pranks."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.416.a:0 "I like this one"
 
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.417.t:0 "The Blood Runes"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.417.d:0 "The recent arrival of the Obsidian Legion has incited panic amongst the dwarves, yet in us goblins they bring out a morbid curiosity. Tales of the magical weaponry of the Obsidian Dwarves has been the source of this interest, with axes that rot flesh and swords that can melt someone from the inside, and canon batteries that fire with a power unrivaled by any in the world, all powered with just a bit of magical blood. Of course, we can’t just ask the Obsidian Dwarves to share what they know, for they are notorious for killing or enslaving every goblin they see, so we have sent out scouts to scavenge remnants of Obsidian battlefields for their infamous Blood Runes. The scouts could only find a few blood rune weapons in working condition, but after one of our court mages decided to test them using his own blood, we were instantly able to confirm their effectiveness after the blade melted through our table.\n\nWith this revelation, some shamans, referred to as Scribblescratchers, have taken to replicating these Obsidian runes. Scribblescratchers will scratch these runes onto equipment and then put them through a frightening ritual where they execute a prisoner with magical blood on the spot, allowing their blood to flow onto the item and empowering it. Similarly to the obsidian dwarves, this practice can even be brought into battle, with these unfortunate souls being called “Scribblesappers”. Though many in the clan are outraged at this new practice for its cruelty, if we stay on the side of the Scribblescratchers, our nation may see a new era of prosperity painted in crimson red."
