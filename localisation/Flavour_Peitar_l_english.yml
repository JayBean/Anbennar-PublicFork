 peitar_prepare_the_gladewardens_title:0 "Prepare the Gladewardens"
 peitar_prepare_the_gladewardens_desc:0 "The Gladewardens are an elite sect of warriors, scouts, and paladins. Believing zealously in the power and guidance of the Fey Lords, they serve them unquestionably patrolling the Domandrod. However, they might be persuaded to join our cause. Us Peitar are humble servants of the Fey Lords, it should be no problem to gather the Gladewardens if we remind them of this."
 peitar_rein_in_the_wayward_flock_title:0 "Rein in the Wayward Flock"
 peitar_rein_in_the_wayward_flock_desc:0 "Ever since the betrayal of seasonal heretics, Eordand has been splintered into countless tribes and polities. None but the Peitar stay true to the old traditions, the right traditions. We must uphold our vows and shepherd the heretics back into the fold, by war if necessary. Any blood spilt will be necessary, not even a cost, for our cause is just."
 peitar_extinguish_heretical_worship_title:0 "Extinguish Heretical Worship"
 peitar_extinguish_heretical_worship_desc:0 "The Fey Lords taught us to respect the natural beauty and power of the seasons, but the heretics twisted their words and began their blasphemous reverence of one season above all. The natural order of the world is the flow of the seasons, one never empowered above the rest. The crime of breaking the natural order should be met with swift and firm justice. But if we are to integrate the heretics back into the fold, they cannot all be dead. They should feel gratitude for our mercy."
 peitar_congregation_of_the_faithful_title:0 "Congregation of the Faithful"
 peitar_congregation_of_the_faithful_desc:0 "Those faithful and true to the Fey Lords are scattered across Eordand in their own enclaves. Our greatest flaw, the Peitar themselves bicker amongst each other for petty reasons. It is time to convene a grand meeting of the Peitar nations and unite against the heretics!"
 peitar_seasonal_neutrality_title:0 "Seasonal Neutrality"
 peitar_seasonal_neutrality_desc:0 "The Peitar are those who remained loyal to the doctrine of seasonal neutrality set by the Domandrod Fey. We must maintain our neutrality by respecting each of the seasons equally."
 peitar_domandrod_communities_title:0 "Domandrod Communities"
 peitar_domandrod_communities_desc:0 "The Domandrod is the forbidden domain of the Fey Lords, a mystical forest replete with both beauty and danger. However, due to our humble service to the Fey, the Peitar have been permitted to dwell within the forest. Although those settlements are beyond our reach, there are some in the boundaries of our realm that are beholden to our rule. We must extend our rule in these regions and claim the riches of the Domandrod for ourselves!"
 peitar_service_to_the_fey_lords_title:0 "Service to the Fey Lords"
 peitar_service_to_the_fey_lords_desc:0 "As our influence over the outskirts of the Domandrod grows, the Fey Lords have requested that we show proper deference. They require that we honor them with glory, and specify that we must make those kneel who are not our own. Some skeptics suggest in a borderline heretical statement that the Fey mean for us to focus our attention elsewhere, but what do they know?"
 peitar_sunset_title:0 "Sunset"
 peitar_sunset_desc:0 "Murdkather, the mighty court of the Summer Court apostates, must be seized. Its heresy must be sunk as deep as the ocean depths that they so revere!"
 peitar_wilted_flowers_title:0 "Wilted Flowers"
 peitar_wilted_flowers_desc:0 "The proud and haughty Selpheregi think of themselves as superior, but they are heretics, nothing more. Their lies must be stopped by seizing the Spring Court of Arakeprun."
 peitar_fetid_harvest_title:0 "Fetid Harvest"
 peitar_fetid_harvest_desc:0 "On the island of Einnsag the false paladins of the Tuathak plan their conquests of the true believers. This Court of Autumn must face its final reaping."
 peitar_final_thawing_title:0 "Final Thawing"
 peitar_final_thawing_desc:0 "Far in the north of Eordand, the Winter Court stagnates in their adoration of Winter. Their icy fortress of Gemradcurt will melt into naught but a tarn after our righteous fury."
 peitar_claim_oathsworn_legacy_title:0 "Claim the Oathsworn Legacy"
 peitar_claim_oathsworn_legacy_desc:0 "While we Peitar have sworn to restore the balance of the seasons throughout Eordand, our allegiance to the so-called Oathsworns of Pelomar are tenuous. Ever since the defeat of the first Pelodan, the Peitar tribes have acted independently of the Pelomar. For the sake of our cause, let us assume the title of Oathsworn to those worthy of its title."
 peitar_four_seasons_under_one_title:0 "Four Seasons Under One"
 peitar_four_seasons_under_one_desc:0 "The foremost goal of the Peitar will always be to unite Eordand under the true faith. Once the balance of the seasons have been restored by ending the heresies, our lands will thrive unlike ever before."
 peitar_ward_of_summer_title:0 "Ward of Summer"
 peitar_ward_of_summer_desc:0 "The official gateway into the Domandrod in the south, Sidpar has traditionally been stewarded by the Swiftswords of the Peitar. The Ward of Summer must be controlled by the Peitar lest the fair woods and Fey be corrupted by our heretic brethren."
 peitar_ward_of_spring_title:0 "Ward of Spring"
 peitar_ward_of_spring_desc:0 "Arankid stands as the Ward of Spring, closely guarding those who can enter the Domandrod from the west. However, it has fallen into the hands of the Vernal heretics of Arakeprun: it must be returned to the hands of the Peitar."
 peitar_ward_of_autumn_title:0 "Ward of Autumn"
 peitar_ward_of_autumn_desc:0 "The Autumn Ward in Orachran, once the sole possession of the Iadth Peitar, served as the staging ground for the Peitar invasion of the Tuathak states of Oreig and Dorcurt. We must ensure that the connection to Domandrod remains secure."
 peitar_ward_of_winter_title:0 "Ward of Winter"
 peitar_ward_of_winter_desc:0 "The northern gate to the Domandrod, Dungat watches over the silent and cold woods to the north. Although operated by the Peitar Gateguards of Strutmar, we must ensure that it remains within Peitar control."
 peitar_fifth_ward_title:0 "The Fifth Ward"
 peitar_fifth_ward_desc:0 "For as long as anyone could remember, there were four entrances to the Domandrod. One for every season, each faithfully guarded by the Peitar. But for reasons unknown, this harmony was recently broken by the establishment of a fifth gate in Fogrim. Originally seen as a second Winter Ward by the Snecboth, the Hibernal Crusade has recently claimed it as a new Autumn Ward. Regardless of how to classify it, we must take this new ward of the Domandrod and establish proper Eordellon guardians for it."
