 beggaston_A_2_desc:0 "As we braved the cliffs of Noruin, we often found ourselves traveling with other Cannorians. The strangest of this lot – and, yet, the ones we came across most often – were the half-orcs of the Chipped Tooth Company. As mercenaries who worshiped both Corin and Dookan, they were of two minds. Sometimes, we would share stories by the campfire, braving the cold nights of the Ruin, and they would give us extra rations even when food was scarce. At other times, they would let us know (with no hostility in their voices, rather only an acknowledgement of a truth) that, once we settled in Aelantir, they would gladly conquer us if they were paid enough coin to do so. They were freely and openly belligerent, and yet were giving and kind all at once.\n\nAs far as we can tell, the Chipped Tooth Company ended up settling in around the same area as we have. If we come across them, we will almost certainly come to blows: Let us hope that these blows are temporary, and without great offense. They have more than earned our respect, and we have more than earned theirs. May the strongest adventurers win in the quest for Aelantir."

How did you find me?”\n\nThe Beggastonic settler stammers, unable to fully comprehend. “Gifts. No more raids. Take this.” She lowers her arms, pushing the box towards him.\n\nThe horseman opens the box, then stares in shock at the beautiful pendant inside. He lightly touches it, feeling its cold metal, appreciating its craftsmanship, before finally looking up towards the gift-giver.

Back then, we all could have gone our own ways over the vast plains of the Expanse: but water bound us together.

The first task of the first Circles was determining water rights, and ensuring that everyone had enough to Prosper.\n\nIn the years since, we have conquered hunger and thirst alike. We found Ynn, and we became her disciples; we brought Begga here, and shared Charity with all. Through worship, through hard work, and through cooperation, our Circles have brought water to everyone who needs it. The Ynn no longer floods, for we have sated her; families no longer fear drought, for we always have enough water. From the beginning of our great work to the present day, our quest has been one of finding abundance and Prosperity. Through the Dams and the Dome, that Prosperity has been achieved."

In every promise made, they were an assumed collateral.\n\nIn the new Ynn, fighting is done by consent of the Circles. We have to use conscription – without soldiers, we would be crushed – but we made it as justified as we can.

Then, these sub-Circles distribute their manpower mandates between their own sub-Circles.

The Calassani Trading Company only equipped her with the worst ships they had to offer, strict instructions not to enter their pre-existing colonies, and the well-wishes of a group which simply wanted her and her rabble-rousing followers out of the country. We were the only ones who had faith, and so we are only ones who have been rewarded.\n\nIt took us over a year of avoiding the monsters in the Ruined Sea to dock in the Bloodgroves. It took a year more before we realized other powers had already claimed those Groves for themselves. Six months later, we faced the same problems in the Trollsbay, and realized the only way out was up. It then took twenty-one grueling months to become some of the first Cannorians to scale the Cliffs of Ruin, only to be forced west by the Ynnic natives after a single month.

 flavour_beggaston.1.d:0 "A scrawny, gaudy noble – or, perhaps, a man desperately trying to look like a noble – has come to the Circle with a too-intense gaze and a contract bound on vellum. His squire in retinue, after blaring a tarnished trumpet in the center of [Root.Capital.GetName], reads its contents to a bewildered crowd: “We, the signatory Calassani Trading Company, hereby transfer a one-hundred-percent ownership share of the Shining Circle Adventuring Company to Sir Anderol Froedam. Froedam is thereby fully authorized, with the legal backing of Damescrown and the military support of all Calassani-hired adventurers, to establish the Kingdom of Froedamia in the Epednan Expanse.” This “Froedam” then coughs, laughs awkwardly, and proclaims himself “King Anderol the First” in the town square. In this moment, we realize the folly of our actions.\n\nAs we were preparing to depart for Aelantir, we signed a contract which stated that the Calassani Trading Company would fund our expedition, in return for them retaining full legal ownership of our colony. This seemed a great deal, perhaps even a steal; out here in the Expanse, where it takes years for a single emissary to reach us, Calassani’s vast powers could demand nothing more than the occasional shipments of taxes. In isolation, we were freed from interference... or, at least, so we thought. How very wrong we were.\n\nThe adventurers who have followed us through thick and thin move to support “King Anderol,” and the merchants of Ara nod as they accept a change in ownership. We, though, the people of the Shining Circle, the fervent worshippers of Begga, do not. After all we have suffered, after all the struggles and deaths it took to get here, we shall not have our fate determined by some buffoon wielding vellum. As Matilda Silverlocks hears this proclamation, she puts out a call to arms: all followers of Begga are duty-bound not to accept this betrayal. We shall expel this pretender king-by-contract!"

The “King” may have fled – gone as soon as he realized he was losing, speeding off towards the Ynn even as his followers assured him of victory – but the Circle now has no one to support them, no government to speak of, and not a single connection to the outside world. Half the adventuring companies in [Root.Capital.GetName] lie dead in the street, whether they sided with or against the peasants; every merchant in the country, disgusted with the bloodshed, has already left for Damescrown. All the Circle has is each other.\n\nTo a stalwart band of radicals, bruised like overripe fruit, Silverlocks attempts to salvage the situation. “This... this’s an opportunity,” she says, as unsure of herself as the crowd is. “We were bound by ‘em, before. Bound to a way’a livin’ we didn’t want. We came here – look, why’d any’a you follow me in the first place? It wasn’t for wealth or riches, was it? No, ‘course not! If it was, you’d be with the idiot king, not with us. You came here – we all came here – ‘cause’a Begga. ‘Cause we were surrounded by riches that were hoarded by the people who already had all the fortune. We couldn’t give ta one another, we couldn’t support one another, ‘cause none of us had anything ta give in the first place. And even when we got here, we were obliged on all sides: we had ta send tribute, ta pay tariffs, ta follow people who didn’ understand.

Hells, we can pay you more than that!”\n\n“Heh, yeah,” the mercenary replies. “He’s goin’ to all the Ynn elves, you know. ‘King Anderol.’ Tryin’ to get ‘em to send an army against you. Promisin’ he’ll be an Iosahar. Says he’ll do whatever it takes to conquer you back.”\n\n“Is it working, then? Are we gonna see thirty thousand elves march into town?”\n\n“Naw.

As father pleads, the river takes.\n\nHe overturns all Selocshana to find his child. The River’s Hands rescue a drowning boy.\n\nThe father finds his son, asleep and unsteady. The Hands tell him that he must pray.\n\nHe worships a goddess that is not his own. In desperation, he clings to any faith he can find.\n\nThe son awakens, hearing Begga and father. They weep together, and tears flow towards the Ynn.\n\n“I am Lord Talvynn yen Nizel of Selocshana, and I will follow Begga until the day I die. The Ynn takes, but Begga gives. I live in the grace of her charity.”"

 flavour_beggaston.5.t:0 "Repudiation"
 flavour_beggaston.5.d:0 "Ysaar has tended to the Dam for thirty-eight years, and he has learned the ways of water all the while. To channel the River is not to control it, but to grant it a new opportunity: it will always find a path, and will always lead towards the depths, no matter how hard you try. Every new tributary is an experiment, a dance, an exploration of the Ynn and its love for the world. Nothing can stop it, for a reservoir without release will always come to burst.\n\nDespite this, the Krahnorians have tried their best to impede the River’s flow. They have sent their “Hands” on missions to deny the River, to tell its people that the River does not support them, to insist that simply because one cycle– one cycle!– has been a bad one, the River has been lost forever. They conquer the Iosahars, break the contracts held with the Ynn, and convert its people to their own faith. They have the gall to march into the Dam, take it for themselves, and then request reconciliation. It seems that the “Beggastonics” are not only monsters; they are, in fact, also fools.\n\nYsaar curses as he sends missive after missive to every lord in Sarda, telling them of the Hands and what portents they bring. He wrings his own hands until they chafe, then wets them with the River, then writes in watercolor once more. These outsiders, and their pet lord in Selocshana, must be expelled from the Ynn entirely!"

 flavour_beggaston.6.d:0 "“Ricain yen Froedaine, yes? It is your turn to take the plunge.”\n\nWithin the walls of the Teal Keep – glazed with brilliant blue, softly shimmering with anti-runic wards – a single human sits in this conspiracy of unequals. “My father,” he says, his mouth dry, “was supposed to be an Iosahar. We were all supposed to be Iosahars.”\n\nThe ruinborn to his right once ruled over a realm more populous than three Beggastons put together. With an air of regal projection, he proclaims: “All our fathers were Iosahars, and all of us were meant to be the same. The Ynn has demanded our allegiance since time immemorial, and we have kept our promise to the River. But Sarda has lost itself, betrayed its sacred duty, and it has left us unable to fulfill our oaths of protection. The River runs wild, with no guardians, no Iosahars. This can only lead to a flood.”\n\nThe ruinborn to his left descends from a Ynnic Emperor. “We shall be that flood, young Rican. We shall wash over the Beggastonics like the River, and we will restore balance to its tides. Are you ready to become anew?”\n\nRicain nods, and his face is shoved into a pool of water by both adjacent ex-lords. After two full minutes he is allowed to breathe in, and as he breathes out, the ruinborn to his left bellows with pride. “As those who oppose us have taken the Sarda and bent them towards Begga, we have taken this Krahnorian and brought him to the River. We will take back our homes; we will take back our empire! By every Iosahar in Sarda, we shall be free!”"

These stories are now erased from the world, one cannonball at a time.\n\nWith every volley, we demand surrender. With every volley, they refuse. We do not want to destroy this center of Ynnic power; we want to rule from the Keep, to turn it into a symbol of republican triumph. We wonder if we should cease, if we should stop our assault and try to lure the Keep’s garrison out of their fortress. If we do so, though, we are placing a greater value on this monument to feudalism than we are on the lives of the fallen. We cannot hesitate, for these symbols are not ours to revere.\n\nWhen the lucky shot strikes the last supporting beam, we watch the Keep collapse. A hundred lords, and far more of their servants, had been assaulting us from their fortress for more than a month, but with this crash of brick and beam and tile, there is little chance that any of them survived. We can feel the glares of the townspeople, still in their homes, as they watch us destroy everything they have ever known. We only hope they can come to forgive us in time."

 flavour_beggaston.8.d:0 "Some castles have been destroyed, their walls torn down like the feudal order they symbolized; others have been repurposed, made into bases from which Beggan Circles rule; others still retain usage by a dispossessed lord, now too disempowered to keep fighting back. Some temples have replaced paintings of the Ynn with sculptures of the Regent Court; others have added representations of Begga alongside their River; others still seem unaltered from when we first began to rule. Sarda is changing, but its transformations are not complete. Though many still mutter of our blasphemy and incompetence, they are no longer quite so powerful as to maintain a revolt.\n\nDuring one of our many patrols around discontented Sarda, a guardsman is approached by a too-thin-by-half Cannorian. The stranger throws a musket down on the ground, and then says: “I want to repent. I am sick to death of hiding. Please – can you forgive me?”\n\nIn return, the guardsman blinks a few times, looks down at the man, and says, “What?”\n\n“My name is Ricain Froedam. My father fought your people, and I fought your people, too. But I don’t want to anymore. I don’t want to be stuck in a hidden barn, with no companions in the world save for a cow and a chicken. I don’t want to hold on to a kingship that my father pretended to hold. Please, take me in: please, take me back. May I serve you? What must I sacrifice to the people of Beggaston to be deemed worthy of their mercy?”\n\nUnsure who this strange man is, and without any actual authority, the guardsman stammers. “I, uh...”"

You pretend we are flawless, but we are not: now we finally are without foes, and can focus on our own Prosperity. Are we going to ruin that now, after all we’ve built? Are we here to conquer for conquest’s sake, or are we here to help people?” – Matilda yen Darant, arguing in the Circle of Hands.\n\nOur fields Prosper, but still some go hungry. Our Hands provide what they can, but there are boons which they cannot afford when so much of our budget is directed towards war. And, too, while we may have abolished lords and fiefdoms, we are not a nation free from injustice: still there are the petty tyrannies of overreaching Circles, of gifts which become obligations. Beggasrad is not perfect, but we can make it perfect. We now have an opportunity to try.\n\nThe Circle of Hands has decreed a complete overhaul to our nation’s administration and finances. Conscription is hereby abolished: while we will retain an army, it shall be constituted only of volunteers. Beggasrad shall dedicate great quantities of its budget to health, education, and Prosperity; with great hospitals and schools in every community, we shall conquer disease instead of the world. The Circle of Hands’ role will be reduced mostly to a judicial one, settling disputes between Circles as they argue over who should be Giving to whom. All else will be left to our people.\n\nDespite our change in focus, there are still those who demand our intervention into the outside world. We hear their cries that others suffer while we Prosper, and, truly, they are right. Therefore, we will create an army – not of soldiers, but of Hands – who shall provide a Halann-wide task-force of Charitable givers, bringing food and Plenty to all who need it. We shall perfect our Prosperity at home and abroad, and never lose sight of our purpose. For all who suffer, Beggasrad will provide!"

Shall we still claim to be Charitable, when we no longer share our Prosperity with the world?” – Matilda yen Boyac, arguing in the Circle of Hands.\n\nTo the west, peasants toil under the yoke not only of backwards lords, but also of the arbitrary Fey. To the south, slavers spend lives like crowns, working orcs to death just to maximize their profits. Everywhere we look, there is starvation and disease: the masses live and die for the benefit of their masters, without ever being able to stand for themselves. From our utopia, we witness a constant and global calamity.\n\nThe Circle of Hands has decided that we shall no longer simply watch. We obligate greater contributions of grain from our Circles; we require many of them to be retooled into training grounds. We transform farms into mines, and community workshops into manufactories. This will require sacrifice, but sacrifice is part of Charity. We have Fortune, and others do not.\n\nThis process shall cause strain in Beggasrad: but it is a strain we can tolerate. We brought Prosperity to Sarda, the Expanse, Veykoda, Dolindha, and Rzenta: with each conquest, we have made everyone richer. Our rule means functional dams, great works, surplus food, and self-determination. Our rule is a boon which must be spread to the world. For all who suffer, Beggasrad will provide! "

Here in the Grand Temple of Svemel, the elf could have been surrounded by retainers, but he relented out of a sense of hospitality. After sharing in fine wine, providing his finest meats, and listing off all the treasures he had gifted to his attendants, he finally asks the question of the evening. “I think I’d like to become an Avatar. How does that sound?”\n\nThe Emulant spits out his drink. The young elf continues to speak. “You see, I like your ‘Ara.’ She’s quite the goddess: one of fortune, and wealth, and luck, and prosperity. She provides for her people, but she understands that ‘providing’ doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy a good life! And your other gods, the ones you follow so closely: Begga, and the Ynn. They are her Avatars, yes?”\n\nThe Emulant nods, then starts to explain the nuances of ascension. His host ignores the details. “Yes, yes, of course. That Corin in the east, she was an Avatar, but now she fights to lead your Pantheon... and Castellos, the previous ruler – I’ve heard he also had an avatar, long ago. A powerful... dragon. Is that right?”\n\nThe dragon’s guest begins laughing in distress. Varlangeilt uses a scaled hand to raise a glass in celebration. “I like your Circles; I think they’re quaint. And I’ve never opposed something that will make my people richer. Beggasrad may rule, but the Rzentur will be charitable to me, for I am their champion: I will give them love and prosperity, just as you wish. To Beggasrad, to Ara, and to her newest avatar!”\n\nThe guest hesitates to raise his glass in return, causing Varlangeilt to snarl. “I am offering you cooperation and good faith, Emulant. Do not tempt my own charity. You can treat me as a foe, or an Avatar. Do you wish to see my people kneel to both of us, or to me alone?”"
