 flavor_telgeir.1.b:0 "Reject the claim."
 
 #Missions
 telgeir_own_gabmorionn_yearncliff_title:0 "Border Disputes"
 telgeir_own_gabmorionn_yearncliff_desc:0 "Before Tristan of Vanbury was bestowed Telgeir and surrounds for his efforts in arming the Empire during the Lilac Wars, our land was disputed between the lords of Esmaria like Gabmórionn. We have always been seen as outsiders in Esmaria, and land disputes between us and the south are as frequent as the steel pouring into our foundries... until now. Yearncliff yearns for us, and an old and decrepit lady rules Gabmórionn. The time of Telgeir has come."
 telgeir_own_rayalanar_title:0 "Conquer Temple Lands"
 telgeir_own_rayalanar_desc:0 "We have never liked the Cult of Ryala, preferring the likes of The Dame and Balgar - and in turn, they have never liked us, seeing us as foreign heathens who refuse to pay much respect to their goddess. The expansionists within our realm suggest this as the next course of action."
 telgeir_buyout_of_esmaraine_title:0 "Buyout of Esmarainé"
 telgeir_buyout_of_esmaraine_desc:0 "Ever since the Grand Duchy of Esmaria was dissolved in 1365, the greedy merchants profiting of the Esmar have taken control of the once great capital of the region.\n\nTheir greed can be used against them, however, and the coffers of the Vanbury Guild never disappoints."
 telgeir_own_bennonhill_area_title:0 "Bennon Expansion"
 telgeir_own_bennonhill_area_desc:0 "The foundries of Telgeir always hunger for more resources, and the goatlords of Bennon are coincidentally in the way of our progress in harvesting the metals of the Havoral."
 telgeir_full_fl_title:0 "Telgeiran Standing Army"
 telgeir_full_fl_desc:0 "Telgeir's position as the border between the decadent riverlords of Esmaria and the decadent merchants of the Damescrown has always left it in a precarious position between these two rich powers. We already have the means to produce weapons and arms, so why not create a true standing army to protect our interests?"
 telgeir_army_professionalism_title:0 "Steel Drill"
 telgeir_army_professionalism_desc:0 "Telgeir has always relied on expertise in arms than strength of numbers. We have the means, but now we must invest in training a true professional army."
 telgeir_aranmas_grain_title:0 "Grain Production"
 telgeir_aranmas_grain_desc:0 "The lands of Aranmas has always been fertile and perfect for cultivating food, but their nominal lords have never been as efficient as us. Under Telgeiran rule, Aranmas can reach its full potential!"
 telgeir_own_calascandar_title:0 "Steal CLSTC Trade Secrets"
 telgeir_own_calascandar_desc:0 "During the Lilac Wars the armourers of the Vanbury Guild and the Calasanni Trade Company (CLSTC for short) saw each other as rivals on who could out-fit the most knights and men-at-arms, and which armours were the most efficient and recognizable in the field of battle.\n\nNow that the traditional headquarters of the CLSTC is ours, we may be able to gain an edge over our rivals."
 telgeir_return_to_vanbury_title:0 "Return to Vanbury"
 telgeir_return_to_vanbury_desc:0 "After the Greatwood Uprising the House of Vanbury were banished from their ancestral lands, and with it the prosperity of their home province, Vanbury began to dwindle. While the Baldfather Kings attempted to keep their profitable steel foundries and armouries open it never reached its previous wealth and simply became just one of the cities along the Alen... until now.\n\nWith a Vanbury on the throne once more we can make Vanbury the true capital Gawed deserves: rip the curtains and sell the gaudy trinkets of the Baldfather and Gerwick kings, and move the court and its riches to Vanbury!"
 telgeir_gawed_anbennarization_title:0 "Telgeiran Nation"
 telgeir_gawed_anbennarization_desc:0 "It is a new age for Telgeir, no, a new age for Gawed.\n\nOur time in the cultured south has changed us, and so should it change the people of Gawed. No longer will Gawed be seen as a backwater place with backwater people, but a true syncretic mix of the best parts of elvenized Anbennarian culture and hard-working cultures of Gawed."
 telgeir_own_aranmas_title:0 "Own Aranmas"
 telgeir_own_aranmas_desc:0 "To prevent dependency on food from the lords of Esmaria like Asheniande, Telgeir traditionally buys their produce from downriver rather than up, hoping to avoid any sort of blockade on much-needed supplies. While we were allies during the Fourth Lilac War, Aranmas has increased tariffs on much needed grain, forcing us into seizing the means of production for ourselves."
 telgeir_own_heartland_border_title:0 "The Heartland Borders"
 telgeir_own_heartland_border_desc:0 "At the very edge of Esmaria lies a dangerous choke-point: the borders between the Imperial Heartlands and the Alenic Frontier.\n\nThe elven castle of Calascandar stands proud at the borders, challenging any would-be attacker to brave its defenses and risk being caught between mountain and sea. If we are to rise as a great power in Anbennarian politics we must secure this castle and surrounds, no matter the cost."
 telgeir_own_damescrown_title:0 "Conquest of Damescrown"
 telgeir_own_damescrown_desc:0 "With the natural flow of the river, many of our wares make their way down trade barges to the city of Damescrown, where they are then sold to clients all over the world - indeed, the largest branch of the Vanbury Guild even resides there.\n\nBut enough is enough! Long have the greedy merchants of Damescrown taken larger and larger percentages of our profits, so maybe we remove the middleman once and for all?"
 telgeir_large_army_title:0 "Vanbury Royal Army"
 telgeir_large_army_desc:0 "Blades have been rattled, and the rise of the Telgeiran State is nigh. We must create a formidable army to challenge even the Marquisate of Arbaran - and after we have hegemony of the northern reaches of the Empire, we will be able to act with impunity for our true ambitions."
 telgeir_restore_vanbury_to_gawed_title:0 "The Throne of Gawed"
 telgeir_restore_vanbury_to_gawed_desc:0 "With the extinction of the royal house of Gawe in 1152, the throne went their cadet family, the House of Vanbury. However, Ricard of Vanbury, the claimant to the throne, was also the son of a Siloriel of Lorent, the principal rivals of Gawed. This sparked a war of succession, with Ricard aided by the nominal 'Ioriellan Empire' (Lorent and its sphere of influence under Ioriel) against the anti-Iorielist forces (much of Gawed), who was secretly being funded by Jexis, the Empress of the Phoenix Empire.\n\nThe war ended in 1162 with Ricard claiming the throne, and was eventually known as a liberal and modernizing figure - always striving to integrate Gawed with the new elvenized way of things... until we were deposed by the uncivilized anti-elf brutes of the House of Baldfather during the Greatwood Uprising of 1170, two years after Ioriel's death."
 telgeir_gawed_throne_restored_title:0 "Vanbury Restoration"
 telgeir_gawed_throne_restored_desc:0 "At long last, the wrongs of the Greatwood Uprising have been righted.\n\nThe true heirs of the House of Gawe, through the line of Lord Caylen of Vanbury, second son of King Stovac I Gawe, has been restored to the throne of Gawed!"
 telgeir_own_vertesk_title:0 "Own Vertesk"
 telgeir_own_vertesk_desc:0 "The city of Vertesk is both the entrance and exit to the riches of not only Gawed, but the entirety of the Alen, stretching all the way to Escann. Conquering this great city will connect our lands in Gawed to the world."
 telgeir_telgeiran_renaissance_title:0 "A New Telgeir"
 telgeir_telgeiran_renaissance_desc:0 "The drums of change echo a new age in Cannor. We must keep abreast of these developments and welcome it wholeheartedly. No longer will Telgeir be a foundry attached, but a new city of industry, yes, but also culture and the arts."
 telgeir_giberd_title:0 "Gnomish Ingenuity"
 telgeir_giberd_desc:0 "Telgeiran armour has never been known to be the most beautifully crafted, nor the most ornate. What we are known for is affordable and trustworthy goods that any knight can wear, and any standing army can rely on.\n\nBut why can't we be both? The gnomes of Giberd have been a consistent trading partner of ours, but what if they are capable of adding the flair that our products have been lacking?"
 telgeir_advanced_foundry_title:0 "Modern Foundry"
 telgeir_advanced_foundry_desc:0 "With all three races of industry working together as one, we will now be able to create products unrivaled in finesse, number and reliability. The wars of the world will be fought with Vanbury arms, on both sides."
 telgeir_industrialization_title:0 "Steel and Smoke"
 telgeir_industrialization_desc:0 "The advent of coal has marked a new and prosperous opportunity for us - as if the gods themselves have bestowed a great gift for our realm. The cities of Telgeir are nothing but ready to be heralds of a new age of industry."
 telgeir_silverforge_title:0 "Fix Dwarven Relations"
 telgeir_silverforge_desc:0 "Telgeir and Silverforge have long been collaborators, in fact, the founder of Telgeir, Tristan of Vanbury started the Anbennarian branch of the Vanbury Guild with many dwarven investors from Silverforge.\n\nHowever, with our role in aiding Lorent in the Fourth Lilac Wars, the dwarves of Silverforge have wanted nothing to do with us. Dwarven stubbornness to a fault, but the war is long over, and now is a time to work together again."
 telgeir_hre_electors_title:0 "Imperial Ambition"
 telgeir_hre_electors_desc:0 "Like all Princes of the Empire of Anbennar, we have our eye on the throne. We should stir up some support from the electorate."
 telgeir_hre_emperor_title:0 "Damerian Legacy"
 telgeir_hre_emperor_desc:1 "Under the Silmuna Grand Dukes of Dameria, Anbennar entered an age of great prosperity - and it was through their rule that Anbennar became the forefront of civilization and the arts - not to mention hegemony over Cannor. Their legacy has not been forgotten, and neither has their ambition. We must be crowned Emperor."
 telgeir_hre_imperial_ban_title:0 "Defend the Empire"
 telgeir_hre_imperial_ban_desc:0 "Over the course of time, many of our Princes have foolishly lost territory to the uncivilised nations beyond the Imperial borders. Unfortunately, that makes us look weak. Recover them."

 flavor_telgeir.2.t:0 "The Return of the Vanbury Kings"
 flavor_telgeir.2.d:0 "Centuries ago, the Vanbury family was denied its birthright as kings of Gawed and forced to flee. Now, the wrongs of the past have been righted, and the House of Vanbury rules again from their ancestral lands.\n\nOur time in Anbennar has changed us and our people, however, and we have brought these changes to the Alen with our return. Now the Gawedi have begun to embrace Anbennarian culture and values, and some believe that it is perhaps time to rename our kingdom, to better reflect our new identity.\n\nThe Vanbury are..."
