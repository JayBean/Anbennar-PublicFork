 orcish_beserker_frenzy_desc:0 "Known by the dwarves since times immemorial, the dreaded berserk fury of the orcs was only first truly appreciated by the surface-folk during the devastation of Escann in the Greentide. Few formations can withstand the terrible might of a frenzied warband's charge."
 orcish_control_the_clans:0 "Control the Clans"

 orcish_teach_the_young_desc:0 "Ours is a cruel and unforgiving world, and it is best that the young learn of the harsh truths of life sooner rather than later. This ensures that we always have a supply of world-wise warriors at the ready when life eventually claims our own."

While we seem to have lost this ability after Dookan's son, Korgus' passing, our colour is still adapted to that of our current environment."
 orcish_orcish_legions:0 "Orcish Legions"

 goblin_sneaky_tactics_desc:0 "We goblins were nothing but fodder to the  Dookanson, used as flimsy meat shields. And while we were slaughtered by adventurer firearms, the orcs mindlessly charged after the first barrage, running over every dying goblin and bringing them to an agonising end.\n\n Now that we are free, this will no longer be. We will fight as we learned in the darkness of the caverns, cleverly hiding and attacking with poisoned arrows, ambushing enemy leaders and bleeding their armies. This is the way of goblin warfare, and it is the way we will forever follow as long as we are free."

 goblin_life_under_the_blue_sky_desc:0 "Though still a hostile place with our former captors and adventurers still lurking, Escann is a much more pleasant place to live than the Serpentspine, with its lush forests and serene lakes. Here, we  need not fight over any source of food or water for there is plenty for all.\n\n With this bounty has come changes among the clans. The ancient traditions celebrated in the darkness of the caves are now festivals in the sunlight and under the shadow of ancient ruined temples consecrated to the many gods of mankind. In this beautiful place, we gblins can create something better than our ancient homeland. Perhaps we found a home at last."
 goblin_looting_for_knowledge:0 "Looting For Knowledge"
 goblin_looting_for_knowledge_desc:0 "Escann is not only rich in food and resources, but also knowledge. Among the old human ruins are books, scrolls and all manner of written stuffs that survived the desolation brought by the Dookanson. All as valuable as any other loot.\n\n However, these texts are written in a language unlike the crude tongue of the Dwarves we came to grudgingly learn. If we are to make use of this treasure we must decipher this language.  Fortunately, we goblins are equally cunning and intelligent. To learn this “common” script, we will capture those adventurers who can and force them to teach us the language of humanity, and learn from the knowledge left by those who inhabited these beautiful lands before us"
 goblin_the_naegub:0 "The Naegub"
 goblin_the_naegub_desc:0 "With the progressive modernisation of the clans, a new social class is emerging, created by those goblins who are considered within the clan to be the most astute and have the best manners, as well as having managed to adapt more quickly to the language of humanity than their congeners. They are the Naegub.\n\n Ranging from merchants to negotiators and even diplomats, they act as the link between the clan and the realms of the other civilised races. They are involved in every transaction and negotiation, be they commercial or political, always wringing the most they can for the clan (and themselves). As such, it is a role of great power. Something that garners immense respect, and envy, within the clan."
 goblin_always_prepared:0 "Always Prepared"

 pactseeker_forest_goblin_with_a_little_help_from_my_friends:0 "With a Little Help From My Friends"
 pactseeker_forest_goblin_with_a_little_help_from_my_friends_desc:0 "Governing is all about delegating. No one can do everything. The archfey, who we have made extensive pacts with in the past, rely on our warlocks to make their sometimes incomprehensible agendas a reality. The chain of delegation doesn’t stop there, though. As we may work for the archfey, other fey may work for us.\n\nOne example is the Aralez. These fey come in the shape of winged dogs and are exceptional at carrying mail and messages, all for a bit of consistent attention. Another common fey we work with are fairies. They can be difficult partners, but are excellent consequences for missed taxes. And we shouldn’t forget a favorite of all administrators, Dobies. Scarcely coming up to a goblin’s knees, Dobies will faithfully copy any text or writ given a pact for a warm hearth.\n\nSuffice to say, we’ve gotten very good at delegating. It’s no wonder that our clan functions smoother than so many others."

 pactseeker_forest_goblin_for_our_patrons_and_us_desc:0 "By now, everyone knows how closely coupled our clan is with the fey. It is natural for others to assume that our clan’s actions are not just our own choosing, but also our patrons’. We’ve found this to be particularly useful during peace negotiations.\n\nMore than once, as we sat across from defeated foes carving out our rightful winnings, we’ve found the threat of invoking our patrons’ wrath to be enough to quiet any protests. After all, what’s the loss of one more province compared to the anger of the archfey?"
 pactseeker_forest_goblin_secrets_of_the_fey:0 "Secrets of the Fey"
 pactseeker_forest_goblin_secrets_of_the_fey_desc:0 "The ignorant believe that the Fey are bound to the Feyrealm. And fools assume that the only connection between Halann and the Feyrealm is the Deepwoods. We are neither ignorant nor foolish. \n\nGiven enough will and power, a fey can cross into our world. And, throughout not just Cannor but all of Halann, there are many portals tucked away connecting our plane and the Fey’s. Perfect for the Fey we have pacts with to cross through.\n\nFrom these crossings, these fey have seen many things. They’ve heard many whispers of knowledge. And sometimes they deign to share those with us."

 old_ways_forest_goblins_never_trust_a_fey_desc:0 "“Remember, Syz. You cannot trust the Fey.”\n“I know, papa. But, I want to know why.”\n“Because long ago, the Fey betrayed the Goblins.”\n“For doing what?”\n“Nothing.”\n“That’s not a good reason!”\n“Does a beast need a reason to bite you? It’s just its nature.”\n“So all fey are bad?”\n“That’s right, Syz. All fey are bad. And we must always be watchful.”\n“Okay, papa.”"
 old_ways_forest_goblins_the_other_goblins:0 "The Other Goblins"
 old_ways_forest_goblins_the_other_goblins_desc:0 "Our clan has changed. We are still a tribe of goblins, but not all of us call ourselves Forest Goblins. Many in our clan are newly freed slaves from the wretched orcs. Unlike us, they come not from dark forests of the Deepwoods but rather from the deep caverns of the Serpentspine. \n\nWhile we do not regret saving them from orcish oppression, we cannot help but recognize they are a little strange. They don’t talk quite like us. They don’t look quite like us. And, they don’t think quite like us. The first one can be fixed. The second we will just have to ignore. But, the last one… it might prove valuable."
 old_ways_forest_goblins_from_the_fringes:0 "From the Fringes"
 old_ways_forest_goblins_from_the_fringes_desc:0 "Our clan is all too familiar with making more with less. Our ancestors, their ancestors, and THEIR ancestors spent their lives on the edges of the various groves that dot the Deepwoods. It was a poor place, little more than sticks, stones, and a whole lot of nasty creatures wanting to eat goblins. Despite this, the Forest Goblins endured and even thrived. The beasts that threatened us quickly learned our old adage - “Sticks and stones can break bones.”\n\nToday, our clan has a proper home and proper weapons. But that doesn’t mean we’ve forgotten how much can be done with less, and the tenacious spirit of our ancestors is still with us."
 old_ways_forest_goblins_clanboss_by_prowess_not_pact:0 "Clanboss by Prowess, Not Pact"
 old_ways_forest_goblins_clanboss_by_prowess_not_pact_desc:0 "Every goblin clan needs a clanboss. They need a goblin who ensures that a clan works together, with an iron fist as needed. Us forest goblins are no different. However, there are some that believe that a pact with a dirty fey is all you need to become clanboss. That a little bit of unearned magic will get you the clan’s respect.\n\nNot in our clan.\n\nOnly the strongest goblins, the smartest goblins, and the biggest goblins have the right to be clanboss. A clanboss must earn their position. And that means showing you’ve got what it takes."

 deepwood_orc_everything_not_nailed_down:0 "Everything Not Nailed Down"
 deepwood_orc_everything_not_nailed_down_desc:0 "When we arrived in Escann from the depths of the Serpentspine, we were amazed by all the riches that could be plundered from even the smallest towns and villages. No longer did we have to live on scraps, as any orc under Dookanson could provide for themselves if they could swing an axe. In the Deepwoods, however, we have had to make do with less once again. There isn’t all that much to go around, so you’d better make sure you take all you can get."
 deepwood_orc_unending_warfare:0 "Unending Warfare"
 deepwood_orc_unending_warfare_desc:0 "Since the moment we entered the Deepwoods, we have not had a moment of rest. Unlike the Escanni, every single denizen of the woods knows how to wield a blade, and they have all been raised against us. All the better. We shall keep fighting, and we shall become more tenacious with each battle, more vigilant with each ambush, more brutal with each raid."
 deepwood_orc_towns_of_stone_and_wood:0 "Towns of Stone and Wood"
 deepwood_orc_towns_of_stone_and_wood_desc:0 "As the invasion has dragged on, the orcish forces have slowly dragged to a halt. The tide of  invasion has turned into raids and counter raids, and mobile war encampments have turned into palisaded settlements. Unwelcome as we may be, we live here now, and we had better act like it. There is rock and wood aplenty, and we will build our new home with them. We are here to stay."
 deepwood_orc_legacy_of_the_great_invasion:0 "Legacy of the Great Invasion"
 deepwood_orc_legacy_of_the_great_invasion_desc:0 "The great orcish invasion was the largest army the Deepwoods had ever seen. An amalgamation of many clans, the invasion force cut through the forest and obliterated all opposition. So successful were the early advances of the warbands that latecomers to a battle had barely any work to do in picking off the stragglers. This bred an eagerness for glory in all the clans, who were always eager to get their part of the battle before it was over."
 deepwood_orc_strong_chieftans:0 "Strong Chieftains"
 deepwood_orc_strong_chieftans_desc:0 "The Greentide in Escann was shattered abruptly when Korgus was slain, the now-leaderless clans frenziedly gathering what power they could for themselves in the aftermath. This did not occur in the Deepwoods, where Korgus was always a distant figure and the clans functioned with great autonomy.  By the time that news of Korgus’ death reached the forest, the unity of the clans had long since disintegrated and the chieftains warred against each other from their own autonomous domains. Though these internecine battles sapped their strength, their lack of reliance on central authority left the Deepwoods orc chiefdoms far stronger than their Escanni counterparts in the long run."

This, however, does not mean they are respected.\n\nStarting in 1620, Eilísin began expanding their policy of mages assisting wine production, through the use of spells, in order to meet the growing demand for Eilísin Tríros, disregarding these well recorded laws of magic. To the despair of the rulers of Eilísin the increased usage of magic did not increased crop yields in the long term, seemingly having the opposite effect. In order to remedy this state mages, and even rulers, went down unnatural paths to restore the fertility of the soil and meet the ever-growing market, to keep the profits flowing.\n\nDuring the reign of Rewan IV there were many instances of bodies of farm workers being found, their life force drained. While they were never linked to Rewan IV directly, these rumours proved too much for the Lorentish King at the time, who called for Rewan's execution and had his titles confiscated.\n\nRewan was never executed, disappearing on the day of his execution."

Imbued with new purpose Maugun set about catching the beast; stalking the Unicorn for a year before he caught it.\n\nBlessed with his new mount, and a refocused purpose, Maugun returned to his home of High Ording. He found it in flames. Without a moment's hesitation Maugun flew toward the besieged town, barely dodging a fireball, thrown his way by a marauding mage. Moving fast so as to avoid a second fireball Maugun sped toward the man, killing him in a single strike. Fortunately, the raiding force was a small one, and with the help of a few volunteers they were easily routed.\n\nIn the following year Maugun fought hard to defend his home. His valiant bravery made him popular with the locals, who coined the name "Maugun the Unicorn Knight", and later he befriended King Rewan Lorentis of Lorent, who granted him the Duchy of Great Ording.

For Rubyhold the Institute has been an important way of keeping tabs on what humans are doing, with the added benefit of sometimes uncovering new ideas the dwarves had not considered.\n\nMost famously, it is here that the Lencori Plan was devised: the idea of creating a human nation out of the local tribes to act as a shield against external threats for Rubyhold.

Among the lessons learnt: having an outer set of gates, instead of just relying on the main gates of the hold for protection. These were named the Redgate and the Rivergate. Wrought and rewrought five times in our history in response to new lessons. The gates have stood up against the Ashen Skies, the Dragonswake, and foul sorceries.

The distances involved in transporting them, combined with the relative scarcity, meant West Rubies have historically commanded a premium price.\n\nThe most famous West Ruby is disputed, most go to the Great Rose on the Ruby Crown of Lorent, which is ringed by five lesser rubies, collectively assembled to create a stylised rose. As a result, many Cannorians also refer to West Rubies as Rose Rubies.\n\nIn cultures further east that is not the case, West Rubies being associated with sunset, blood, or endings instead. The ancient crown, the Dwarovkron of the Dwarven Empire was said to have the largest West Ruby as its centrepiece, which was a late addition to the crown to mark the official recognition of Rubyhold as a hold equal to those underneath the Serpentspine. Such a controversial decision sparked the last great civil war of Aul-Dwarov, the War of the Bloody Gem, which to many was the final omen leading to the Last Days of the Dwarovar and the fall of dwarven civilization."

The discovery of new world gems in the colonies only increased the quantity of gems arriving in Rubyhold for cutting. During the 1600s ruby dwarves began setting up gem cartels, in many cases directly taking over the operation of mines in the new world. With long mining expertise, many countries were eager to accept the assistance of the cartels in their colonies. Those cartels funnelled gems of all shapes and sizes back to Rubyhold. Gems from Lorentish colonies arriving via Oldport and the Redgate, gems from imperial colonies arriving via Exwes and the Rivergate.

The lead designer of the renovation, Teagan of Freecestir, was struck with an idea upon seeing the behemoth banners; a way to not only incorporate them into the Castle, but to create a new array of defenses. Every section of wall was covered in banners, with very little space between them or the ground. Behind any banner could be a hidden door, a trap of some sort, additional arrow slits, or simply nothing.

But following some incident (the details are unclear) shortly after he turned 25, he was all-but-exiled from the land of his birth, and he headed east to find better fortunes in the foreign realm called Castanor.\n\nHe found a place tending to Castan V the Great's wolf-hounds, descendants of those raised by Castan II Beastbane. Though a lowly kennel assistant, he struck up a friendship with the Castan, whose favourite past-time was hunting with his canine companions, and deeply appreciated their beauty and vigor.\n\nWhen the Castan marched on the Alenic Frontier, Clothar accompanied him as assistant and retainer, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Legion II Vertesk. When the wars came to a conclusion, Castan the Great granted him a large swathe of land (including Derwing), elevating him as a 'civilized' and 'domesticated' Alenic.\n\nThe Lord Derwing, ruler of the Lower Alen under Castanor, would serve well for roughly two decades more, keeping his vassals at bay (though they despised him) and visiting Castanor every year or two to make personal reports to the Castan. But following his death to a bone cancer, many vassals refused to pay his successors any fealty whatsoever — they were denigrated as 'sons of a bitch, the lot of 'em' — and most lands beyond Derwing itself were lost.\n\nThis is our legacy, well-earned by service and never revoked from the family of Derwing.

And so, the regent sent Petran to spend his youth amongst the city folk of Esmarainé, the old capital of the disbanded Grand Duchy of Esmaria.\n\nAmongst the Esmarainé wealthy, and their extravagant parties, Petran would learn three skills that would serve him well for the rest of his days: how to drink, how to argue, and how to tell when someone was bluffing. With these experiences in tow, Petran would return home a skillful diplomat and would lead Terr through the harsh realities of imperial politics.\n\nWhen Petran's children came of age, he would send them off to Esmarainé as well to experience it just as he had.

In the north, the hunters of Bennon wished to secure the Havoral Divide, and Terr's lands in Havorton lied in their way. To survive, Terr would have to act decisively.

While this act put Terr at odds with their overlord, they would go on to side with the mages along with many other minor lords when the civil war would break out in 1253.\n\nMany years after the war, Terr's fondness of Aranthíl and the Magisterium has never waned.

She wished not to ask the other lords for help lest they take advantage of Havorton's precarious situation and lay claim to the county to prevent the Havoric Kingdom from rising again, and so sought alliance with Warin, another lesser noble like her who happily accepted the countess's hand in marriage, bringing Havorton under Terr's rule.\n\nWarin marched confidently into Havorton with little heed of the enemy forces. What he assumed would be a ragged band of vagabonds turned out to be an army led by Henric the Fierce, a Havoric descendant gathering power to restore the kingdom, starting at its ancestral capital of Havorton. When all seemed lost, Warin picked up the fallen eagle banner and waved it high, reminding his men of the countless drills and battles that have been fought under it over the centuries, successfully driving Henric's men into the Esmar river and filling it with blood.

These Black beetles wandered from one flower to the next, chewing them clear of their petals.\n\nWhen the halfling, Isabella Brightflower, heard of the blooms deep in the Terr forests, she departed Viswall immediately with dye tools in tow. Brightflower set up a small lab on the edge of the forest and went to work. She found meager success, as each of the flowers produced too little pigment per petal to be an efficient dye. One day she came in and, to her horror, found her red flower petals had been eaten by dozens of bright red beetles. However, Brightflower recognized these beetles as the Terrman flower beetles, only they had turned a brilliant red, and then she had an idea. It turns out that the beetles turn the same color as the flowers they are fed, allowing for intricate and precise colors to be manufactured.\n\nBrightflower soon found herself in a storm of new dyes and colors. Unfortunately, the beetles never managed to survive the trip back to Viswall and so, Brightflower set up shop in Terr. While the dyes were never produced in the same quantities as they were in Viswall, the colors were still brilliant and easily distributed throughout Esmaria, bringing great wealth to Terr and her people."

In short time, the order seized the whole of Loveswood and united with the Ryalan Temple, serving as its militant arm in a revolt that resulted in the death of the Themarennic Duke and a suing of peace soon following.

Yet, amongst the clergy, a priestess by name of Kerstie of Tretun would rise to carry the burden of leadership and the mantle of High Priestess. It was she who skillfully negotiated with the Emperor to convince him to enact "The Ryalan Privilege": a statute stating that in return for the Temple's legitimization and blessings of all Emperors' weddings in perpetuity, the Emperor would reaffirm the Temple's right to govern Ryalanar Proper and Loveswood.

The custom of the twin bands evolved to be associated with - and became the dominant symbol of - Ryala (and therefore true love) and was proselytized throughout the old empire to noble and commoner alike to both honor Castan's success and help popularize the first marriage rites of the emergent Cult of Ryala."

 A43_springtime_floods_of_the_ryal_desc:0 "Just as the river Esmar flows through Esmaria, so too does the Ryal flow through old Ryalanar. Oddly, the Ryal, by proportion, floods its banks nearly twice as high as nearby rivers every thawing of the spring and many consider this phenomenon to be a holy occurence. In fact, the flooding of the river is so consistent that natural scientists within the Empire have been able to predict river levels within an infinitesimal margin of error. Curiously, the villages and towns lining the Ryal have also been the origin of more than a few avatars of Ryala. Whether this is due to the increased presence of Ryalan clergy in the area to recognize avatars or the river being truly blessed by Ryala is still a hotly debated topic amongst the top scholars of the faith."

Traditional Ryalan marriages were considered by many Corinite folk in Escann as overly formal and even austere occasions; and most importantly: a symbol of Adeanic control. Among other upheavals, the most noteable and controversial was the disregard of the old marriage ceremonies: replaced by immethodical celebrations, wedding bands by cameo pendants, and white dresses by simple blouses; further reinforcing the Cannorian religious and cultural divide. It was not until the Corinite Wars had reached their apex that the High Priestess of Ryala, in an effort to limit violence between sects, proclaimed that the new Escanni marriages and customs would be considered legitimate by the clergy of Ryala and upheld as the "Canons of Escanni Rite"."

Of old ages past, tyrannical warlords and righteous kings alike vyed for the hands of Lady Ryala's incarnations, hoping to prove themselves worthy by word or pursuing their desire through deeds of arms and armies: tales as ancient as the faith itself. Yet, these tales are not just that: the most recent conflict for an avatar being between the Duchies of Cestirande and Istralore. As the conflict reached unprecedented levels of bloodshed with no end in sight, the Emperor declared all hostilities between the two duchies must cease in order for the matter to be settled by the High Priestess of Ryala. It was ruled that a contest of affection would be held with the ultimate choice of who she would wed, if any, being decided by the avatar herself, marking what is known as the first diplomatic solution to a conflict for the hand of a Ryalan avatar."

Fortunately, Silverforge evaded scrutiny due to slavery here being based on a system of indentured service and intergenerational debt for the crimes of the orcs against civilization.

The challenge spread to the Esmari river parties, where humans would line up to challenge the iron gullet of a dwarf. Some dwarves would accept multiple opponents at once to even the odds, with little change to the outcome.\n\nThe true show only really began when orcs challenged dwarves to the competition.

This would soon be answered as, after a few decades of exploration, ancient dwarven weaponry was being discovered with some finding their way outside of the Serpentspine for those with enough coin.\n\nWith these ancient weapons, the task of replicating their design was assigned to Grun Strongbellow. As the head of the project, he worked tirelessly and was able to make an early redesign of a rifle in 1523. It was fairly accurate for the time but would be too expensive for army-wide use. With this limited success, he went on to update the artillery batteries that Silverforge used, keeping them above the curve in comparison to their neighbors.\n\nStrongbellow would die in 1589 of natural causes and would be remembered in Silverforge for his dedication and ingenuity. In 1652, a university was built and named after him dedicated to Gunsmithing and Metallurgy."

Under the Akalate of Dartaxagerdim, however, a renaissance of all things magical began under the patronage of the sages of the szal-Fazil.

Serving as a conduit for those disillusioned with Sun Elf rule across Baharšes, szel-Harrumaz coalesced his newfound followers from across a myriad of Old Sun Cult traditions into a single unified and fanatic force, the Šebhuliam, meaning green helmets in Bahari. This was  a militant sect dedicated to the sole purpose of ridding Bulwar of the Sun Elf yoke, just as it had thrown off that of the gnolls and the Djinn.

Upon its discovery, Irsakar gifted the hold to the dwarves of his kingdom to resettle in exchange for their service.

For decades, the council would convene and arguments would rage with each clan claiming some legitimacy or prestige that would validate their claim to rule the rest. In the interim, a single clan was selected to oversee administration of the hold with term limits of 20 years.

While not all dwarven sailors belong to this clan, for much of history they were the most likely dwarves to be found trading hold supplies with Ruby Dwarves in Oldport, competing with the copper merchants of Busirat, haggling for grain along the Coast of Tears, or buying silks in Brasan.

This was most true when it came to trade policies. This administrative advantage combined with their long lives, led to the copper clans holding debts over most of the great houses across bulwar. Whenever the political tide turned against Ovdal Tûngr, they could leverage these debts to ensure their advantage. This changed, however, with the arrival of Jaher and his elven legions. To ensure the loyalty of his conquests, Jaher banished all dwarves from his realm and forgave all debts they owned. In response, Odval Tûngr sided itself with the resurgent Castanor led by the Sorcerer-King.

Copper Bottoms as they are known among the humans were pivotal in the dwarven primacy along the Divenhal trade routes.

In 1491, however, a visiting dwarven inventor by the name of Grun Strongbellow would propose a new hydraulic system that could drain even the deepest of mines.

After the war he was ordered to give the lands he occupied with his army back to the Esmarians but he refused, and used his River-Reavers to continue to dominate the riverways of the Esmar against his foes.

The crystal was used to keep a simple transmutation spell that protected the silver from ever tarnishing.\nBut in 1440 Cristof was taken away from her far too soon, as he died during the Fourth Lilac War. When she found out about his unfortunate passing, she glanced at her ring. It was glowing as radiantly as it did the day it was made, not stained by a single smudge. At that moment, she realized that they were not connected in a mere union of a man and a woman. No. It was not only Reánna and Cristof who were united in wedlock.

Just outfitting for an expedition might cost a hefty chunk of the quest's potential profits, in terms of potions purchased and armor repairs.\n\nBut the ruinborn, ah the ruinborn... They will pay vast sums for shoddy muskets, and give away for almost-free magical reagents that artificers and sorcerers will pay trunks full of crowns for.

Some flee due to persecution of their faith, like the Corinites, while others flee because of unjust purges against their kind, like kobolds. Some are not pioneers but instead ruinborn, wanting to live in peace with their new neighbours.

The breaking of the Greentide in 1443, however, was a rallying cry to the dwarves of Cannor. Scions of lost holds, cartels, great families, even famous individuals, no matter the dwarf, all are kin of Balgar, all are kin of Dagrin Everbeard, and all have been roused to action!

As we restore our reclaimed holds and word of our success spreads, dwarves from all across the world flock to join us, united by a shared dream - a reborn Aul-Dwarov, a dwarven homeland restored to its legendary glory. Our ranks boast dwarves from every walk of life - no matter your birthplace, clan, or class. As much as the old dwarven clans that have persisted in the surface want to control our adventuring spirit - the reclamation of the Dwarovar somewhat mirrors the expulsion of our kin from the homeland so many years ago: it is a fresh start."

But the first two Fundamental Truths to life is that we all live in One World, and are created by One God, and so Varil did not stop there. By 1631, almost every Busilari ship engaged in the Kingdom's prodigious Sarhaly and Halessi trade would carry with it an array of new inventions along with a missionary who would use them to spread the teachings of the One God. In trading ports across Halann, in the wake of a Busilari trade fleet's visit, small communities of Ravelian adherents would undoubtedly spring up."

By 1441, all 86 packs of the Hillthrone gnolls had been subdued and united under her leadership, through war, diplomacy and marriage, thus becoming the first undisputed Queen-of-the-Hill in recent history. Whilst her enemies accuse her of having sold her firstborn to demons in exchange for power, these claims only exacerbate her already fearsome reputation, for she would stop at nothing to keep her people free from human domination."

To fix this, the seventh Queen-of-the-Hill, Zabrixa instituted the Brainmarrow Pact, demanding Hillthrone mercenaries working abroad to bring a piece of knowledge or technology every five years.\n\nThe plan saw great success, most likely because should they fail to meet that quota the mercenary's family would be executed, and whilst it didn't prevent the ultimate downfall of the Hillthrone Gnolls decades later, it did bring them closer to Cannorian culture and ideas."

Seeking asylum in nearby Sugamber, the Queen-of-the-Hill submitted herself and her last remaining armies to the duke, in exchange for a land to settle. Thus, the county of Honderaak was born.\n\nWhilst still looked down by most humans, these 'Dovesworn Gnolls' (as they'd eventually be called, after the Anbennarian sigil) eventually embraced human gods and traditions and become integrated within Sugamber society, some scholars even considering them a completely different race from their savage Sarhaly brethren due to their 'civilised' temperament."

 U08_unbroken_republic_desc:0 "The Republic of Ekha was established in 332 BA in opposition to Menkaunswt's conquest of Akan. Despite being defeated on land, Ekha stood strong on the waves and managed to strike a favorable peace deal, keeping its autonomy in exchange for tribute. This continued until Damerians invaded Kheterata in 105 BA. This presence of another successful democracy in the Divenhal reassured the people of Ekha about republican government. Akan was then conquered once again in 475 AA by Crodamic people. For some time the country was a vassal state of Akan, until Sedoric I granted Ekha title of march as a gratification for help during Akani Civil War. During the Era of Black Ice Akan was conquered by Gerudian reaver Henrik Divenscourge, however his rule quickly ended and the people of Akan took their land back from invaders. However, now Ekha is at the brink of destruction - the gnollish horde of Viakkoc is at the gates, only stopped by a yearly tribute. But the republic will not fall - not now and not in the future!"

 U08_dechan_frontier_desc:0 "Ekha is uniquely situated at the westernmost point in Sarhal which gives us geographical advantage to explore what lies beyond the vast ocean. This, combined with the dire situation of the country, gave the Dechan movement an opportunity to rise. Many merchants and traders travel to the new world establishing outposts and settlements to profit from transoceanic trade. Some of them however, want to escape their homeland, seeing the republic and vision of free Akan as doomed; their foolishness will bring us glory and gold."

 U08_desati_sisterhood_desc:0 "People of Ekha don't consider Planetouched as holy as ancient Akani or Fangaulans, but they still are an important part of culture and society; Desati Sisterhood exemplifies this state of things. Many Desati sisters are planetouched which is seen as a sign of nobility and blessing from Mother Akan. It is said that they descend from Storm-Queens - the ancient rulers of Akan. While this claim is probably incorrect, their influence over the republic cannot be underrated; daughters of storm, as they call themselves, hold many important societal, government and military positions. They are based in numerous secluded sanctuaries in Akan mountains however some live in city temples to help local communities. "
 U08_pri_nebiw:0 "Pri Nebiw"
 U08_pri_nebiw_desc:0 "Pri Nebiw, translating to “The House of Gold” refers to the splendorous palace in the center of the city of Ekha. It holds many important facilities - courts, assembly hall, diplomats and president's quarters, and even prison. Dripping with gold and silver, it is a prime example of eclecticism - it mixes elements of Businori, Imperial, Fangaulan, Akani, Kheteratan and even Gerudian architecture. It was built in 479, but was rebuilt multiple times, each time adding new elements, mostly to appease the Ramset - legislative body of the government, but also to show power and extent of influence of the state. It is the place where the most important decisions in political life of the republic happen - a single topic can be debated for days, if not for months. People say that's not because of their love for the republic, but rather to spend more time looking at this beautiful piece of art. And with the new age of the republic comes a new Palace worthy of our mighty empire."

 U08_new_ekhan_arsenal_desc:0 "Ekhan Arsenal is one of the oldest and most important institutions of Ekha, probably as ancient as the city itself. Its service to the republic is indisputable, providing quality ships for times of peace and war. It was expanded multiple times, most notably during The Third Cinder War in effort to fasten ship production. Despite its importance, it has fallen into disrepair in times of gnollish subjugation due to lack of sufficient funds. But now it stands greater and more efficient than ever, restored in 1521 thanks to patrician patronage and most notably Izemrasen kas Diven's gift. Our outstanding engineers and new technological advances in shipbuilding allows arsenal to streamline ship production producing up to 1 ship per day while keeping them at exceptional quality."

Since the 1630s it also schools Tefewmesa - elite marine regiments experienced in fighting on both land and sea. Trained in harsh conditions they are the best forces Ekha has to offer."

With the major nobles of House Silcalas in Arbaran having joined the Moon Party, there was a lot of pressure on Kylian to follow suit. However, Kylian being cousins with the King of Lorent meant he held many Rose Party sympathies. This led to a meeting with the King of Lorent by the Rivergate to decide the role of Exwes in the upcoming conflict.\n\nHere, it was decided that it was better for Kylian to stay out of the conflict, to prevent the Silcalas family from installing a pretender. A compromise was reached with the neutrality of Exwes being guaranteed by the Rose Party and Exwes allowing military access to their members. With the Lilac Wars spiralling out of control with no end in sight, all consecutive rulers of Exwes have upheld the treaty to stay out of the conflict. Even after Arbaran switched sides in the Fourth Lilac War, Exwes remained neutral, despite the main reason for neutrality being gone.

As a foreign dynasty in Exwes, Alec made sure to be relatively lax in enforcing Silcalas views on religious and political matters to appease the local population, and become more Exwesser and Arbarani during his rule.\n\nThis lax attitude came to shape Exwes as a nation shortly after the Corinite Proclamation, when many of the disenfranchised came to Exwes to escape the religious conflict regardless of whether they supported Adean or Corin."

Our oldest tales cite that they fought waves of murderous trolls intent on destroying the Gerudians, yet over the years it has become clear that our early history with them is far more complex. From the oldest settlements along the coast such as Urviksten and Sporreyn, the Gerudians served the waning kingdoms of the Frost Giants alongside their Troll watchdogs.\n\nNestled in the steep valleys at the foot of the Titan’s Rest Mountains, Skaldol has long endured as a sacred site to Gerudians, thrice rebuilt in different ages. As much as times change, from the decline of the ice giants in aeons past to the death of Castanor itself, the mountains and coasts of Gerudia still fall yearly to Elkaesal’s wintry wrath. It is in Skaldol that the first snowflakes fall, and the last of the snow melts.

The Dragon and the Skald, the recounting of the One-Armed Skald’s fateful encounter with Elkaesal, is sung to herald the end of winter and warm even the bitterest winters, a matter of survival for Gerudia.

The draconic rime grew across the land like a fungus over a felled tree, freezing the very land itself.\n\nElkaesal the White watched in delight as the world around her fell into an endless winter. The holds of the Ebonsteel Kings were abandoned and lost under the snowfall, and all who could left Gerudia for lands not yet frozen. Determined to slay the wyrm, the greatest of heroes banded together to save their land! With axe and spear, bow and shield, these great men and women traversed the frigid land, following the trail of Elkaesal. Finally, in the heights of the Titan’s Rest Mountains, they found the dragon’s lair. Within a glaciated cave they intercepted the dragon, attacking with cunning, brawn, and zeal! One by one, the last heroes of Gerudia perished.\n\nBut not all was lost. Following behind, late to the battle, the One-Armed Skald and his students prepared to make their own stand. The Skald entered the cave alone, witnessing the dreadful scene of the slain heroes atop the plundered and frozen treasures of Gerudia. Under the dreadful gaze of Elkaesal’s baleful eyes, the One-Armed Skald began to sing a deep, soothing song - a tale of the dragons long ago. With each verse of the rise and fall of dragonkind, Elkaesal calmed and became drowsy, soon falling asleep into a deep slumber. With the dragon aslumber, the One-Armed Skald emerged from the cave to the First Thaw, the endless winter ended."

Whether burned and drowned by dragon’s fire, or felled by the axe of Gjalund, the rule of Giantkind has long since ended. Inscribed in runes, the tales of the earliest Gerudians have endured on ancient stones. Countless fearsome beasts prowl the forests and fjords, from lindwurms to trolls and werebears, all of which commit great evil before being slain by a valiant einher. From the dawn of time to now, these heroes have not only had their stories recorded and sung by skalds, but have also been mentored by them in the ways of war and life.\n\nBehind Bera, founder of Bjarnrík, were the skalds who fought the Trolls with song and spear. Behind Castan Ebonfrost were the skalds who terrified the Castanorians with our magic. With our guidance, kingdoms have risen. Those who set us aside have failed, fallen to history without our wisdom - Black Castanor set aside our guidance for those of the absent southern gods. Skaldskola has long been the mentor in the shadows of the hero - it is time to be our own legend."

While their magnificent ice-palaces have long since melted, these stone ruins are extensive around the still-standing towers of the Giant’s Manse.\n\nFrom these lonely islands, skalds have long studied the realm of the drowned giants.

Long-dormant seeds sprouted, enduring trees spread cones, and beasts of the land returned. For some time, only the One-Armed Skald and his few disciples walked the awakening land, witnessing the return of all life. For months they exchanged stories of the old world, but also spoke of the future.\n\nThe First Thaw of the snow and the blossom of flowers is celebrated as the start of the new year in Gerudia. It was then that the first Skaldhyrrics organized, teaching the returning peoples of the Elkaesal’s plight. Temples and mead halls are traditionally built in the spring, places where stories are recited and shared.

Aided by their stalwart allies in Bjarnrík, the Skaldic Guard cut down the invaders with halberd and shot, emboldened by the songs of old. The fires of the One-Armed Skald burned bright into the night, a beacon of hope in the war-torn land.\n\nIn Bjarnrík, the corrupt were tempted by the false promises of the Ravelians. Turning their back on their own countrymen for a comfortable place under their Gawedi masters, they struck from within and usurped the Crown of Bera. Skaldskola’s defenders, Olavish and Dalric, were soon cut off and abandoned. The Northern League conquerors cared not to defend Skaldol from Grombar, as they wished for the holy city and its faith to be eradicated. A final stand for the Skaldhyrric Faith, the Guard fought to defend every mile. It is said that the Skaldic Guard went down defending the Archives, for to this day the Ravelian occupiers have failed to plunder the heart of Gerudia."

Of course this is not the case, however, it does provide a valuable opportunity.

While the bill proved extremely difficult to enforce, it was enough to calm the people of Envermark and restore order to the city."

Under Adshaw Dinesck was nothing more than a mere momentary pause for dignitaries journeying to Bayvic. After Gawed turned its hungry eyes north but was solidly rebuffed by Bayvic in fierce fighting, they finally noticed Dinesck, saw the opportunity for a consolation prize, and the city wound up all-but-razed in a sacking by frustrated Gawedi soldiers. Even when goblins rose to power in so-called Bayvek, other Reachmen assumed the same must have happened in Dinesck.\n\nThis is an insult, but also an opportunity.

And when the Reach began to industrialize in the 17th century, the entire Alenic region suddenly hungered for wood to fuel the burgeoning furnaces and proto-factories.\n\nThis was invaluable for Dinesck as it recovered from the Gawedi sack; the city hired out logging teams across the Alen, while devouring more and more of the nearby woods itself. Under the Northern League, Dinesck was instrumental in felling vast swathes of forest fill the Magnates' coffers.

But more importantly, in Dinesck, Tola used the money to build a massive palace just outside the town. But the gentry of Dinesck had long disdained the city's lower classes, and would not relinquish their sneer when one suddenly ascended far beyond their assigned status. For all the palaces' lavish rooms and abundant ballrooms, they ignored any and all of Tola's invitations, not a one stepping foot in his 'Petty Palace'.\n\nTola would live and die in that building, and his fortune enriched two generations of descendants who did the same, before his grandson died without heirs. The Palace became used for two reasons: lumber storage, and impressing visitors who did not know its background.

These lands were almost free of any settlements, as they were as cold as inhospitable. Later, on the brink of the so-called Era of Black Ice, many Gerudian tribes started to settle in the White Reach, where they founded a village named Cedevik. With time, Cedevik grew. In fact, it grew so much that when Castan Ebonfrost became the ruler of Vrorenmarch, Cedevik already was the largest settlement in the whole White Reach.\nThe Castanorian Empire was well known for projects never before seen by a human eye, called Balgar’s Wonders, the nearest example being the citadel Bal Vroren.

When the first gray orcs laid siege to the city, an observation was made. While orcs are native to the darkness - they emerged from it, after all - their eyes need a little time every day to get accustomed to the sunlight. When the first rays of morning light hit the sea, the sailors knew they had a short span of time to get past the orcs undetected. These smugglers managed to keep the city’s sparse supplies lasting for far longer than anyone expected.\nStill, the situation became less and less sustainable as it became clear that no one else would break the siege. Cedevik was on its own. It may have been able to survive for ages, but how can you be truly alive when you're confined within a fortress until the end of times, living like an animal in a cage? The truth is that you can't, and no smuggler can replace that.\nBut they can replace many other things.

Eventually, they were given citizenship and granted the right to vote in 1584. Over the years it became more and more common to see a goblin candidate in what was previously a human position, and in 1602, Reb of the Westflowers, an incredibly popular goblin born and bred in Bayvic, was elected to the most high office of Bayvic, or Bayvek as the goblins call it.

That threat pushed the Gray Orc clans to unite faster and form Grombar, the Land of Gray People.\n\nOne of our new country's main policies was the destruction of orcish clans' importance in social life, tribal lands were revoked and tribesmen were settled in new cities, being forced to adapt to the new urban way of living.

With the greatest technologies, magical and otherwise, we shall build Nimrith anew. Great wings of gold and steel, powered by magic and great furnaces. Shimmering red scales of ruby, jasper and garnet, strengthened with mithril. A powerful maw that spews flames hot enough to rival dragonfire.

This would be used as the primary weapon for the new firedrake formations, who would fight on the frontlines of any offensive, burning away barricade and foe alike before the rest of our troops would jump in and finish off any stragglers."

As the Crimson Deluge and the League Wars ravaged Cannor, hundreds of thousands fled their homes to the shining, peaceful beacon called Anbenland. Faced becoming a nation filled with hungry peasantry lacking skills or crafts, the government enacted a quota on refugees entering the country. Later known as the Great Sorrow, it prioritized those refugees with useful skills and established a new service that those without skills could join to earn access to the safety of Anbenland. These skill-less but motivated souls were organized into The Dule Legion, named after a flock of doves and in honour of their selfless service to the state and her people. These exiles served for 3 years, somberly risking their lives for the defense of Anbenland so that they might one day bask in her prosperity too."

Davan II saw an opportunity to be rid of this nuisance with the Greentide. The constant demands for supplies and funding to rebuild besoaked baronies, and intermittent rebellions from the lack of help, were too heavy a price to continue financing.\n\nJergan of Corveld, an eccentric but charismatic noble with dubious claims to the ruined city of Corveld, was summoned to Arca Corvur. Behind closed doors, the Raven Banner was established, outfitted with arms and supplies to drive deep into the Greentide.

Their zealous hearts fixated on the role of Corin as a defender of the weak and a slayer of evil.

Investing vast sums of her ill-gotten gains into the fledgling town, she invited talented indivduals, improved infrastructure, and laid out the foundations of the city's government. Since those days, Nathalaire has become known as a place where the skilled and ambitious can make themselves great and potentially even rise into the mysterious inner circles of the Shadow Council."

Only effectively opposed by the Tefori Goldwater Squadrons and the Phoenix Armada of Elizna, the galleys of The Black Hulls were fast, maneuverable, and aggressive, favoring short engagements and boarding crews to extended exchanges of cannon fire.\n\nInvolved in privateering and smuggling as well as military operations, there were few sights as beautiful and dreadful for the merchant ships and coastal settlements of the Divenhal as that of Nathalaire's navy under full sail - The ebony wood, dark as night, gliding effortlessly over the waves on dozens of agile oars, their prows pointed towards their next target of trade or plunder."

The Nathalairey are, by-and-large, outcasts and fortune seekers - the exact type of people who Nathalyne patronized in life, and continues to favor in death.

While Nathalaire's isolation and many well-armed ships kept it safe for decades, the years following the Lilac Wars saw major efforts by Eborthíl and Crathánor to conquer the city.\n\nTo properly defend Nathalaire, in 1488 the Shadow Council created the Maritime Guard, the first proper state military in Nathalaire's history. Conceived of as a force that could fight on both land and sea, the Maritime Guard was the brainchild of the great Smuggler Prince Sigmund sil Heartspier, and proved their efficacy with their successful 1490 Invasion of Gemisle."

Slavery quickly became the single most important business in Nathalaire, and so many gnollish slavers flocked to the city to take part in the industry that Nathalaire's slave market was soon known by the gnollish name for it - 'The Krahzate.'\n\nNathalaire grew fabulously wealthy from the slave trade, but the 1589 Anbennarian Abolition led to a precipitous drop in the profitability of slaving. This unprofitability led Nathalairey slavers to turn their eyes towards other uses for their prisoners. Several naval captains noted that orc slaves could be put to use as rowers aboard galleys, their great strength making them well suited for these tasks.\n\nOffered freedom if they completed 10 years of service, many orcs went to sea for the chance to escape bondage and proved themselves to be capable sailors, becoming indispensable for Nathalairey naval operations in the mid 16th century."

Masters of light manipulation, the shadow puppeteers of Nathalaire use beautifully designed paper figures in conjunction with intricate lighting, smoke, flame, and music to put on incredible performances of stories old and new. So realistic are the shadows that some believe them to be more than simple tricks of the light..."

Finally completed in 1689, the Silnath Opera was considerd a masterwork of architecture, combining elements of Neo-Damerian and Bulwari styles that gave it a unique and instantly recognizable look. Coldharbour's vast fortune was further invested in bringing skilled musicians, actors, and performers to teach and perform, and the Silnath Opera would become a major center of the arts throughout the 1700s and beyond."

Records of the name are found thousands upon thousands of years ago, but all records of this first Segbandal were lost to time. In 5848 BA, the holds of the Middle Dwarovar reforged the fabled alliance in response to the fall of Amldihr to the orcs and the proclamation of the Jade Empire by Grônstunad. The holds were equal partners, expected to aid each other against the attacks of orcs in the west and the imperialistic Jade Empire along with goblin raids to the east.\n\nAs this second Segbandal consolidated its power and defeated countless threats to its survival, it grew in wealth and power, reaching a golden age in the midst of the West's fall. Of the five holds of the Middle Dwarovar, it was Seghdihr that slowly consolidated political legitimacy and came to be the de facto leader of the Segbandal, first among equals, protector of Dwarven Civilization, patrons of Bulwar and masters of the mountains."

Its recruits mostly consisted of dwarven exiles from the Segbandal or Ovdal Tûngr, but sometimes included human warriors liberated from slavery.\n\nTheir efforts greatly reduced Gnollish influence in Bulwar, but the Seg Band found itself overmatched during the invasion of the Great Xhaz. Seeking allies, the Seg Band sent emissaries to Castanor and there offered their services to Castan II “Beatbane”.

This mutual cooperation culminated in a treaty of friendship between the two peoples in 2672 BA, when the God-King of the Surani city state that would one day become Eduz-Vacyn contacted the Segbandal for help against an orcish warhost that had emerged from Hul-Jorkad. The Dwarves came to the human's aid 16,000 strong, 3,000 from each hold and 1,000 of the Dauvek Veker of Gor Vazumbrog, led by Krummul Orcslayer himself.\n\nOn the field before Eduz-Vacyn he delivered a famous vow to them, promising to slay every orc in their lands and to teach them the superior dwarven craft of both stone and metal and to foster good relations among each other.

With the hired Seg Band and her Sun Elf Legions occupying the hold, the Segbandal collapsed into infighting, and Seghdihr itself became a shared hold between the dwarves and the Sun-Elven empire.\n\nAfter Jexis' death in 1162, the Seg Band relinquished their hold on Seghdihr in return for amnesty.

They would rather see the lives of dwarves spared to prevent devastating war instead of brutal sieges and guerilla warfare. During the War of the Bloody Gem, King Magûn VI az-Segh offered to duel the King of Verkal Kozenad, Khadan Forktongue, to end the catastrophic war between dwarfkin.\n\nKhadan accepted, but also planned to dishonourably kill his foe. Before the duel began, he ordered a mage to create light which would temporarily blind the good king Magûn. As the spell was cast, Khadan rushed to pierce Magûn with his sword not realising that Magûn's helmet was forged with anti-magical runes from Gor Vazumbrog. Khadan's blow was easily parried by Magûn, who then swiftly beheaded the dishonourable Opal.

This state of perpetual war gave rise to a unique culture amongst the dwarven holds, where sacrifice and skill were valued above bloodline, and the good of the hold was held above that of empire.\n\nThe outcasts of the empire gave more for the survival of their hold than any other dwarf in the Empire, be that by gold or blood. This attitude became known as 'The Chain Bond' amongst the people of Krakdhûmvror, a chain between each member of the hold from generation to generation forged in the frozen hardship of the north."

As it was founded by exiles and criminals, Krakdhûmvror had very few strong clans in its early days. Instead of positions being determined by bloodlines or clans, Krakdhûmvror favors those with individual talent, which has resulted in a far less rigid hierarchy than most other holds. Even those of the most humble of upbringings can rise to the top, and nepotism is all but sacrilegious in the frozen halls of power.\n\nBecause of this, Krakdhûmvror has enjoyed an innovative and flexible administration for much of its existence. Many a time a disgraced scion of a royal clan fled to Krakdhûmvror demanding status and position, based on little more than their parentage, and all were told the same thing: 'Zaru ubr Bloth', Skill over Blood."

This is not without purpose; due to its origin as an expanded fort, every building in Krakdhûmvror is first and foremost dedicated to defence and survival. Even the smallest hovel is built to serve as a fortress unto itself. More than once, these fortifications stalled invading monsters long enough to save Krakdhûmvror from the destruction that befell all other holds in West Serpentspine, leading to a common Quartz Dwarf saying, 'Those in gold houses often end up dead.'"

From weapons that give enemies frostbite and arrows that shatter into shrapnel on impact, to armour that can 'unfreeze' and flow back together, the potential applications of Ice-Steel are widespread.\n\nWhile the production of the hold's signature steel has over the centuries declined, Ice-Steel armaments are nonetheless common enough that well-off soldiers have at least one weapon or piece of armour made of it, making the Frozenforge Hall's armies a glacial wall of unbending steel and death."

Originally built to protect Dwarovar against the Ice Giants of yore and manned by exiles and criminals banished from the rest of Dwarovar, it became a derelict outpost after the giants' civilisation fell thousands of years ago and was eventually expanded to a hold. As the last outpost of Aul-Dwarov, isolated in the Giants Anvil mountains and disconnected from the Dwarovrod network, the only people who arrived to make a new life for themselves in the hold were those unwanted elsewhere in Dwarovar or those trying to escape their past. This led to the outpost developing a reputation for a solitary culture, and having very little interaction with the outside world.\n\nAt least, until the emergence of the orcs. As the holds of Western Serpentspine fell, refugees began to pour to the hold from Amldihr, Orlazam-az-dihr, and Dûr-Vazhatun, desperate for safety from the orcish menace. The rapid expansion of the hold's population forced the dwarves to work with what little resources they had to expand the hold's defences, living quarters, and infrastructure to accommodate a vastly larger population in a relatively short period of time. While this event took place ages ago, the dwarves of the Frozen Hold of Krakdhûmvror still retain the lessons of those days to this day, allowing them to easily integrate foreigners and expand the hold's infrastructure to account for the needs of the people."

It takes the most tenacious and determined people to work together in order to survive in as unforgiving an environment as Giant's Anvil, and centuries of hardships and struggle for survival have led to the dwarves of Krakdhûmvror becoming as unyielding as the quartz they get their name from.

This allowed them to deploy and test strategies new and old, and to constantly refine and tweak the conduct and practices of the armed forces.

This ancient ambition is said to have once consumed the hold.\n\nEven now, dwarves are raised with the tale of Gulan-Amekh, the Golden King. As a young, starry-eyed man, the last king of Hul-Jorkad was said to have spent his life searching for the ritual in which he might turn our lead to gold. Soon enough, though, he was afflicted with intense greed and obsession with wealth, and his goal discarded. Only his fixation on gold remained. It's long been said that Hul-Jorkad might have held, had he not embezzled and hoarded the funds that would've armed the soldiers on the fateful day of the hold's fall, or even that the orcs were sent as a punishment, for a greedy, unfit ruler whose lust for gold had spread to his people, fracturing the hold at every level."

While historically meltwater from the peaks fed through the aqueducts of Hul-Jorkad was enough to maintain the hold, that supply had become nearly insufficient.\n\nMeanwhile, the lake was filled with the life of many fish and edible plants that would provide the Lead Dwarves with food variety envied by the deeper holds. First with simple water wheels along the river's run, and ultimately with the towering mechanical water pumps, the water brought up into Hul-Jorkad would be enough for its people and to sell to every stretch of the Serpentspine beyond.

On a day like any other, with no warning given, The Hunter of the Deep keep came upon Vazumbrog. A great dragon of deepest purple scales, it tunnelled into the hold from its deepest levels, circumventing the Titanium Hold's many defences and killing all who stood in its path. Its corrosive breath ravaged flesh and melted the titanium golems sent against it, while its mere presence maddened and dazed the dwarves that it came upon.\n\nThe beast killed tens of thousands before the General-King admitted the hold could not be saved. Sending the remaining Titanium Guardians against the dragon in a desperate bid to buy time, the King ordered an abandonment of the lower levels and began to organise the total evacuation of all dwarves in Vazumbrog. While the refugees fled to the other holds of the Segbandal and prepared to regroup and retake their home, the dragon settled into its new home.\n\nThe bottom levels of the hold soon became saturated with gaseous poison, which mixed with the virulent magices of the innumerable cursed artifacts in the deep vaults to create The Dragon's Wound, a glowing purple miasma that leeched the spirit and melted the flesh, a permanent stain on reality commemorating the tragedy and hubris of the Titanium Hold."

When the Phoenix Empress Jexis occupied and turned Seghdihr into a puppet in 1139, it shattered the unity of the already eroded foundation on which the Segbandal even further.

The Seg Band tried to disway the Citrine king, however, and when az-Segh decided to provide help to the Topaz Dwarves the Seg Band had him killed in the middle of the night, blaming the killing on Ombrindal.\n\nAfter such treachery, Ozumbrog broke with the Segbandal and attempted to unite with its old ally in the east, Ovdal Kanzad.

Lasting for over a decade, there was little the damaged hold could do in the end to withstand the onslaught. It was only a matter of time when the outer reaches of the hold fell. \n\nLegends say that King Ombrindal alone held the remains of the main gate to the inner hold for over 23 days, long after the last of his personal guard had fallen - refusing the cries of the gate's defenders for him to fall behind the gate to safety. The last two of those days were said to be spent half-dying atop a mountain of goblin corpses, but he granted innumerable dwarves the chance to flee, arriving in Verkal Gulan and Ovdal Kanzad, with the trickle of refugees ending in 1167. The lessons imparted from it are a reminder that the Topaz Dwarves fought for things greater than themselves, and that even hundreds of years after their own deaths, they may be remembered for deeds that seemed inconsequential today."

Even when Og was struck by a stray Fealgarn arrow, he held true to this view. With his dying breath, Og asked his son, and later chieftain, Bosk not to seek vengeance but to learn from his death.

The Blackmoon Clan on the other side was famous for their battle shamans, who unleashed their magical power on the armies of humans and dwarves.

The Sadih know this is not the case.\n\nIt is said that long ago, before the people of the Boek arrived in this land, they were united as a single tribe under a female chieftain named Imar'el. They lived as one and their bond was unbreakable.\n\nWhile it may seem that time has broken this bond, the Sadih have proven this not to be the case. With skilled diplomacy they were able to re-kindle our lost kinship, uniting our disparate tribes into a single entity.

With their backs to the cliffs it was clear to the Boek that there would be no surrender, and they fought with a previously unseen ferocity. The Braves, living up to their name, charged, with disregard for their own lives, headlong into the Cannorian muskets. Refusing to give up what little they had left the Braves pushed on through the gunfire, with each Brave taking as many as 6 shots to bring down.\n\nBut it was not enough; no amount of bravery could make up for the technological disparity between the settlers and the Boek and they were slaughtered to the last.\n\nIn the end it seems the Lenef were proven correct: there is more to war than mere bravery.“ – Excerpt from The Last Stand of the Braves."

As our tribe grows however the prospect of moving our entire tribe becomes a daunting one, and so have been forced to adapt.

They cut down our scouts with the same emotionless precision as they offered the Bloodfeeders.\n\nSo it was for years, that we skirmished with these 'elves'. Though we could scarcely capture them, for the ferocity they offered, what little we could gleam was that they wished to kill all who walk upon the world, save for their own kin. So it was, for a time, our dwellings pushed from the forest that was our home, our trees aflame as we found ourselves set against this great enemy.\n\nBut we were not alone in our fight. A strange short-eared folk followed who too came from across the seas but were embroiled in battle with the elves. Whilst at first we had distrusted these people it became clear we could not stand alone and our braves joined with theirs becoming their brothers in battle, standing at our side, along with many others.

With the settlers came a new breed of Bloodfeeder, one capable of disguising itself as a person, tricking our people into following them away from the tribe where they are drained of blood.\n\nOur braves have become adept at hunting and killing these creatures.

Following the foundation of this settlement the Inek found themselves drawn towards the coast, expanding the Inek settlement and eventually absorbing the Busilari settlement.

The humiliating defeat of the magocrats ensured continued animosity between the order and the Magisterium. Even with the advent of blackpowder, the Arca Aldresia remains nigh impregnable thanks to its multitude of magical defences and the diligence of the orders knights."

 hobgoblin_forging_an_empire_desc:0 "In the aftermath of our invasion of northern Rahen, we had to quickly adapt our administration to accommodate the new territories. Many local leaders organised resistance against our rule, which weakened our control over the conquered lands. In response we hunted them down and executed them. We ensured that they were replaced with weaker willed locals. These meek rulers would lead by example. Under the watchful eye of hobgoblin garrisons they greatly weakened any resistance to our rule. It was through these strict measures that newly conquered peoples and lands could be quickly incorporated into our Great Command as we marched upon Haless."
 hobgoblin_modern_drill_techniques:0 "Modern Drill Techniques"
 hobgoblin_modern_drill_techniques_desc:0 "Through many generations we have developed traditional techniques of drilling our armies. While these techniques had been adequate for border protection and the conquest of the Jade Mines, our expansion into northern Haless introduced us to several new enemies. This kick-started the development of modernised drills. The two main drills were those developed by the Wolf Command, which centered around cavalry flanking maneuvers, and those developed by the Boar command, which centered around massed infantry. The latter of the two would prove a very effective baseline for later firearm drills."

 hobgoblin_warforged_culture_desc:0 "Constant warfare both within and outside of the Jade Mines has pushed hobgoblin society into ever greater centralisation and militarisation in the form of various Commands, culminating in the founding of the Great Command in 1391 AA. This has led to hobgoblin society becoming an incredibly well oiled machine capable of supplying vast armies with extreme efficiency, with almost every household capable of producing weapons, uniforms and soldiers for the Great Command’s endless campaigns. This has resulted in a civil society that is completely integrated into the purpose of the state: War."
 hobgoblin_honourable_service:0 "Honourable Service"
 hobgoblin_honourable_service_desc:0 "Honour is a core pillar of our culture. And honour is kept through loyalty. No good hobgoblin would even consider betraying their duty to their family and Command and lose their honour. A hobgoblin without honour loses their family, their position, their very place in society. They are removed from all the things that give meaning to life and thus often end up with two options, suicide or exile. Suicide is the preferred choice for those who have dishonoured themselves, for such is the weight of our honour. No secrets are spilled."

 hobgoblin_expanded_ninyu_kikun_desc:0 "As the armies of the Wolf, Boar and Lion grew in size and strength, various Grand Marshals of the Great Command sought to expand the forces directly controlled by them beyond the enslaved Zanyu Kikun. This led to the creation and steady expansion of the Ninyu Kikun, the combined army, which answered only to the Grand Marshal. This force would systematically recruit the most disciplined soldiers and most accomplished commanders into the service of the Grand Marshal, eventually forming the most formidable army of the Command. The Ninyu Kikun would be the first of the armies to adopt artillery into their formations, crushing enemy defences and opposition while paving the way for the artillery innovations of the Dragon Command. The existence of the Ninyu Kikun also served to increase the authority and control of the Grand Marshal within the military structures of the Command and by extension their authority over the lesser Marshals."
 hobgoblin_military_education:0 "Military Education"
 hobgoblin_military_education_desc:0 "Hobgoblin military education begins in the family, with grandfathers and fathers beginning the process of passing down their martial skills to their sons from the age of 8. Years of training from a young age form the foundation that a young hobgoblin builds upon through their introduction into larger military divisions, such as a senun, banner, or ten, regiment. It is here that a hobgoblin has the opportunity to distinguish themselves on the battlefield, potentially earning an exaltation from a superior officer. A hobgoblin soldier who earns themselves an exaltation is given an advanced military education and promoted to captain, regardless of their clan’s status. The system of exaltations ensures that the officer corps of the Command has greater pools of talents to draw upon than most states on Halann and prevents the elite clans from monopolising leadership positions."
 hobgoblin_direct_control:0 "The Six Command System"
 hobgoblin_direct_control_desc:0 "Our expansion outside of Shamakhad began to strain the administration due to the lack of loyal and honourable hobgoblins to govern our newly conquered lands. This led to our Grand Marshal dividing the three original Commands into the Tiger, Elephant and Dragon commands, who would found war camps and settle in the lands outside of Shamakhad. The influx of our people into the distant territories allowed for the expansion and spread of hobgoblin garrisons, easing the pressure on our central administration and ensuring that our Great Command could govern the dishonourable peoples of Haless with greater efficiency than before."

Everything, from marital status to the state of the family to even the intricacies of currency were defined in the Reforms, serving as the greatest singular code of laws in Haless.

Among his most famous works, the poem that would become known as The Flower Oath began 'On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.'\n\nMany see a message in these words - a message of ambition, longing, and surety. We agree, and we will embody these ideals as we reaffirm the oath that gave our ruling dynasty its name. Under our firm paw we will bring peace and serenity to Rahen - by any means necessary."

It is a vast pyramidal structure made of stones the color of a blazing sun and fit together so precisely that the temple stands without a trace of mortar between each great brick.\n\nTiltaghar has been the seat of petty kings and great priests in Shamakhad for thousands of years, most recently being occupied as the seat of one of the Dhenijanraj's eight senapti. As the seat of our government, we are caretakers of the temple, and its glory brings us great prestige and the envy of all those who behold its majesty."

A twin to the golden Pyramid of the Tiger, the Elephant Temple is carved of stone that gleams like pure silver, mirroring her western sibling the same way that the moon mirrors the sun in the sky.\n\nThese two great temples mark the ends of the ancient Sojourner's Road, a winding path once walked by pilgrims who believed that the enlightenment of the High Gods could be reached somewhere on that sacred road. Though it has fallen into disrepair in recent years due to the conflict raging in northern Rahen, the Sojourner's Road and Tilathi remain sacred places of great beauty worthy of restoration and protection.

While this decree was unquestioned by many in South Rahen, in Tiltaghar the distance from the centers of political gravity meant that the reform never took as firm of a hold.\n\nThroughout the history of the Northern Senapti, humans proved their valor, skill, and intelligence, and the attitudes of the harimari rulers of Tiltaghar changed to become far more accepting of working with, instead of ruling over, humans over the years. This culminated in the 1601 Edict of Tiltaghar, issued shortly after the collapse of the Dhenijanraj's central authority, and decreed that the highest castes would no longer be forbidden to humans, who would henceforth be equal partners in the land of the Tiger Ziggurat."

Though many feared that the newborn and still fragile Raj would be torn asunder without a capable hand guiding the ship of state, such fears proved to be unfounded. The late Raja’s principle advisor, Goshar of the Golden Paw, Prabhi of Amtujsaat, stepped in as regent to the infant prince and served as de-facto ruler of the Raj for 23 years, raising the prince to be a capable ruler and handing power to him when Shurapalar turned 25.\n\nIn his stewardship of the state, Grand Vizier Goshar was known for his masterful and gentle hand, convincing many to follow the throne with perfectly selected arguments and, when those failed, political assassinations, rather than open warfare. Since the days of Goshar’s stewardship, the lords of Amtujsaat have sat at the right hand of the Raja as their most trusted lords and advisors, a unique position for a Prabhi to hold."

When Manava died in 1478, his daughter Indira succeeded him in an unprecedented elevation of a woman to Grand Vizier, and the passive hostility between the two lordships began to boil towards open conflict.\n\nThe Wars of the Vizierate, which raged intermittently from 1481 to 1505 and began with the death of the Raja Indrapalar IV, were a disaster for the Harimraj. It is estimated that 100,000 soldiers and a quarter million civilians died over the course of the struggle, and the legitimacy of the throne in Dhenijansar was badly degraded. Worse still, 25 years of civil war had allowed the armies of the Jaddari to gain a foothold on the Southwestern Coast, The Command to cross the Kharunyana and seize Pordhatti and Sarnavan, and Bhuvauri to invade the Ascension Peninsula and topple the Senapti of Rabaghekhur.

At the highest ranks of the ministries sits the Circle of Theory and Doctrine, an association of the greatest minds that serve the Raja.\n\nHere, the most skilled of the ministers sculpt the policies that the ministries will take and discuss the best ways to carry out the mandates of the Raj.

The loss of the capital and its centralized bureaucracy facilitated a general collapse of order as the regional governors and lords lost the ties that bound them together. As the Jaddari armies advanced, many of the prabhi surrendered and swore fealty to the Desert Elves directly, and soon a large swathe of lower Rahen was controlled by the invaders.\n\nAfter failing to halt the advance of the Jaddite Army at Rhamirta, the reeling lords of Amtujsaat turned to their southern neighbor, the Senapti of Tujgal, for protection. Offering their fealty to the White Tiger of the Jungles in exchange for protection, Amtujsaat and their fellow prabhi of Umdaj and Parus Panasur became vassals of Tujgal, who proclaimed the formation of a new realm, separate from the old Raj and based in the unified and centralized jungles of the Ascension Peninsula - the Kingdom of Vanrahar."

The 1531 New Sashtabari Codex formalized a decade of Imperial Edicts and ensured that the armies of the Raj were large, flexible, and modern - traits they would demonstrate with great success against the Command in the Second Dhujat War."

The old harimari took a shine to the energetic young Manava and began to delegate many responsibilities to his vassal.\n\nManava, ever hungry for more power and personal advancement, took on these positions with relish, leveraging his personal position at court to amass great wealth, influence, and even seize the nearby city of Nabukh from the Prabhi of Saddathar. At the height of his influence, Manava was the power behind the throne of the Raja - and some claimed that it was he who truly ruled over the whole of the Raj.

Despite our internal diplomatic struggles, the Radiant Sun is also strong in the great mercantile republic of Bhuvauri to the East, and we have cultivated many commercial contacts there.\n\nTheir mercantile bent and knack for a good deal has rubbed off on many of those merchants who have regular contact with the slave-princes, and we find our traders growing more skilled by the day.

But our adherence to the Radiant Sun school of High Philosophy had made the message of the Jadd particularly compelling to our Senapti and many of our warriors, and the ever-ambitious lords of Rabhidaraj sensed an opportunity. Secret talks were initiated with the Jaddari, via Bhuvauri liaisons, to betray the Raja and join our realm to theirs - in return, we would convert to the Jadd and join them as equal partners in empire.\n\nWhen the forces of the Dhenijanraj met the Jaddari at the Battle of Ghamakrit, the Rabhidaraji held the right flank as always - but at a critical moment in the battle, we withdrew and exposed the Raja's center, allowing them to be crushed by the Jaddari cavalry. With the army broken, we marched alongside the Jaddari to the gates of Dhenijansar and threw down the walls for our new brothers in the faith. Thus, by the treason of Rabhidaraj did the Jaddari gain their dominance over lower Rahen - and we obtained our central place as governors and administrators in their growing realm, sculpting policy from within as willing partners instead of subjugated serfs."

The territory traded hands a dozen times until Ramapalar the Reunifier conquered Dhujat in 1306 AA. The great Raja settled the dispute by splitting the land equally betwen ourselves, our ancient rivals, and the Royal throne.\n\nFor many years this dissatisfactory status quo held, with verdant Maharaaja split in three, and Endhuvi waited, patient, for her opportunity to finally take her rightful land. In many ways, the waiting came to be more important than the land itself - for while the plains would eventually be reclaimed, fought over, and lost again, the standoff would come to characterise the Rasarhid people of Endhuvi.

Soon known far and wide as a great hub of thinkers, the Cinnabar Lotus was second only to the Hall of Endless Debate in its prestige among Raheni scholars, and famous members of the society such as Agnimitra of the Iron Way and Vishwanath Andipalar Malviya produced some of the most fascinating treatises on moral philosophy and theology that had ever been seen in Haless."

The cause was soon made apparent when an enormous catfish, its scales glittering every color of the rainbow, emerged from the mud of the river, its tail-strikes shaking the earth. The magical creature was seemingly non-hostile, and folk flocked to the shore to get a glimpse of the vast beast.\n\nThe spirit fish would eventually disappear into the vastness of the river-sea, but returned to the shallows of Endhuvi often. Many took the gentle spirit's favoritism of their waters as a sign of good luck, and whenever the spirit returned festivals would be thrown celebrating its presence. In later times the Spirit Fish would become a symbol of Endhuvi, and its majesty the primary reason foreigners visited the city."

In 1699, the Lorentish diplomat Celador Rosebloom was arrested in Keyattordha and accused of attempting to steal state secrets. Found guilty and executed despite the formal protest of the Lorentish government, the event led a cabal of Cannorian merchants to seek revenge.\n\nStriking a deal with Bhuvauri, to humble the porcelain cities, secret orders were sent Sramaya to the many Bhuvaurite mercenaries garisonning the cities. Upon receiving them, the soldiers of Keyattordha’s garrison mutinied and sacked the city, destroying its porcelain workshops.

The forces of the Lion Command crossed the river at Elephant Gorge, a steep walled canyon that was narrow enough to span with mobile bridges. Though outnumbered and with little hope of relief, the brave warriors of Pordhatti fought the invaders both on the high cliffs above and in the rushing river of the gorge itself.\n\nFor three days the Hobgoblins were held at bay, the terrain minimizing their advantages in numbers and tactics. The fourth day of battle, however, would see the Bloodsong Orcs make a suicidal charge across the gorge to break the human lines. Though nearly a quarter of the Bloodsong fell, the defenders were overwhelmed and pushed back as the hobgoblins streamed across the river, now unimpeded. Elephant Gorge secured, Pordhatti would fall soon after."

The reality of occupation by the northern invaders was, in fact, significantly less apocalyptic than many had been led to believe. While they were certainly demanding and unforgiving, life under the Hobgoblins did not differ significantly from life under the Harimari. If one was competent and obeyed the strict laws of The Command, they could rise high in its bureaucracy or military, regardless of their race or caste. This offered a much higher degree of social mobility than many had ever experienced before, and the level of resistance to the occupiers was much lower than outside observers expected.\n\nAs the years went on, and the occupying hobgoblins permanently established control over the upper Kharunyana, they left their mark upon the culture of the human population under their control. Military discipline, honor, and community became ever more important, reshaping the society into what the hobgoblins called the Wuhyun. The people of upper Rahen had their own name for this culture - Navanyodhi, the New Warriors."

The most prodigious writer of this content during the 1500s was a native of Ghundagar, Akshal Bhirala.

The rebellion was initially very successful, and while the lords of Amtujsaat defeated one of the peasant armies, the rebels succeeded in capturing Sardiphadin in 1559.\n\nThis crisis within their own borders forced the Raja to abandon the defensive fortifications at Shenral to deal with the crisis, pulling their armies back and capturing Sardiphadin from the rebels after a 4 month siege. This time away from the borders allowed the Jaddari to advance through the Bloody Pass and put Rayavashapal to siege, the City of Endless Debate falling in early 1560.\n\nWith the lordship of Pasiragha lost, the Raja was forced to appoint a new Senapti to assist them with the war, and careful political maneuvering by Ghundaghar saw them achieve their long awaited goal of becoming Senapti.

We were rewarded for our patience when, in 1504, the slave lords of Bhuvauri approached us with a plan to crush Rabaghekhur while the armies of the Raja were embroiled in the Wars of the Vizierate. Together we launched a joint invasion, with our armies seizing Pahruavan while the Bhuvauri burned Rabaghekhur’s fleet in port at Sardika. The cowardly Senapti of Rabaghekhur, seeing our unstoppable advance, fled, and we stood alone atop the hierarchy of the Harimari homeland.

In exchange for our protection, the former Prabhi of Amtujsaat, Umdaj, and Parus Panasur became vassals of Tujgal in the so-called Union of Umdaj, an event which united the entirety of the Ascension Peninsula under one strong ruler for the first time in centuries.\n\nIn the aftermath of this unification, the idea of a single, unified harimari state grew popular among the population of the peninsula, with many pointing to the decadence and disunity of Dhenijansar as the principle reason that the Harimraj fell. Instead of old customs, many young officers and thinkers began calling for a new realm, a complete break with the old system of rajas, prabhi, and senapti, with only one centralized government. This concept, called Vanrahar or "Jungle Paradise", aimed to see our home remade stronger and purer than ever before, no longer divided arbitrarily but instead foremost among the nations of Haless.

With the defenders dead, Jagaddipendra’s forces seized the city and slew the Raja.\n\nWhen news of this display spread, it so shocked the feuding warlords of Rahen that they agreed to an armistice until this terrible mage could be brought to heel. When Jagaddipendra did finally fall, his bow was recovered by a young warrior who was given lordship over Saddathar. Though it has not been seen for many years, the Tisarha Dola is supposedly still held in Saddathar, a trophy and reminder of the dark time of the Warlock of the West."

As with many places away from the centers of the schools, however, there are unique regional variations on the common rituals and forms observed by the Golden Palace have sprung up in Saddathar.\n\nHere, this variation takes the form of the Auric Chant, a derived form of standard meditation. Meant to conjure the emptiness of the desert in the mind to enable better self-reflection, the Auric Chant is performed by a group of at least five individuals, with two drummers and two flutists accompanied by at least one cantor. The musicians will allow their minds to drift and become still, striking notes that elicit the rustling of wind over sand and the cries of desert wildlife while the cantor provides a low ululating note to center the musicians and any other celebrants that have come to join the group.Famously done without conductors, each variation of the Auric Chant is different, and while considered highly unorthodox by the Golden Palace scholars in Dhenijansar, the local people are fiercely proud of their unique tradition."

Sandranayar lent huge sums of money and soldiers to the Raj in the pursuit of stopping Suhan, ensured that Suhan’s philosophy was not tolerated in his lands, and came very close to capturing the Guru when his entourage passed through the Red Gates of Shenral as they fled to the safety of the coastal cities."

The old supplies were given to the people in the local villages, who used the surplus materials to hold small celebrations. Over the years, these grew into larger affairs that would involve the whole community baking different breads and pastries that would be available to all in attendance, regardless of caste.\n\nThese festivals would draw people from far and wide and continue into the modern day, where they draw acclaimed culinary figures from across Haless, Bulwar, and Cannor, who all come to share ideas and compete for the prestige of producing the highest quality breads at the festival."

This led to several vast construction projects throughout the region, as old walls were demolished, and new ones were constructed several dozen attilambi away.

And for each one of those merchants, every deal they struck, every good they sold, every coin that fell into their pockets, all of that wealth would return with them back up the Kharunyana, and only make the porcelain cities wealthier yet."

While many harimari in the north resisted these cultural blendings, those of Sarnavan did not.\n\nThe long penchant for pragmatic cultural acclimatization that had defined the kingdom of Sarnavan persisted long after its fall, and many of the harimari families in the region embraced the practices and beliefs brought south by the Command. In doing so, Sarnavan’s harimari would become the most common harimari auxiliaries among the Command’s forces in their southern campaigns, and would merge their martial philosophies with those of the hobgoblins to create extremely skilled warriors."

Toarnen did not benefit from this trend economically, as the cloth was made elsewhere, but it did improve the reputation of Toarnese nobility for being "trendsetters"."

He was a famous figure who sailed his ship across the Divenhal, hunting pirate ships and saving coastal villagers from slavery and worse. One day, he sailed away only to never to be seen again. The Order respected his name by fulfilling his duty. Thus, the Knights of Serondor did not ride horses, but commanded swift galleys and galleons."

It was primarily used for extravagant clothing worn by wealthy Celliander noblewomen, as it was extremely expensive. In later years, when Arannen became the primary center of textile production in the Borders, Doveswall lost much of its relevance, its weavers seeing Arannen as an upstart rival. They invested much into improving their production methods so they could compete with the northern city."

While the Milcori people had later been devastated by the War of the Sorcerer-King and the White Pestilence, the Arannese were considered their descendants. The nobles were inspired by these tales and began fabricating family trees claiming descent from legendary Kings and Queens of Milcorissia."

 A56_milk_skinned_folk_desc:0 "Considered by the Celliander upper class as evidence of their Milcori heritage, the Arannese of Celliande had especially pale skins, and black hair was more common than in the rest of the Borders. Those who lived outside of the Borders saw Celliander women as especially beautiful and elegant. This stereotype became more widely known in the 18th century, when it appeared in Anbennarian poetry and stories. In the 19th century, the term "Celliander" was often used for the advertisement of women's beauty products."

Milcorissia, after all, had encompassed much of the Borders. Thus several futile wars were fought, but Celliande never reached the heights of the legendary Milcori Kingdom. The period of expansionist policy eventually came to an end with the unification of the Empire of Anbennar."

But during the Lilac Wars, it chose the wrong side in the conflict and was dismantled by the victorious Kingdom of Lorent. The Crown of Thorns, worn by the Roilsardi rulers, was burned into ashes. Years later, the Roilsardi defied their Lencori cousins and restored the Duchy anew after reclaiming its former lands. The Crown was remade and is now once again worn by the ruler of Roilsard.

While culturally closer to the Lencori, the Roilsardi aligned politically more with Dameria. However, they often used their position to their advantage to act as mediators between Lorent and Dameria, which enabled them to retain their independence for a considerably long time, despite their relatively small size as a country."

For centuries, Roilsardi pikemen had been a literal thorn in the side of Lorentish cavalry, which inspired the Lorentish General Darien síl Ainethán to eventually develop the Thorn formation.

After the Crusade was over and the Pestilence had been eradicated, some Roilsardi crusaders returned home, but many chose to stay and join their cousins, finally helping supplant the suppressed Milcori tribes that inhabited The Borders. The Crusade brought much fame and respect for the Roilsardi in Cannor, and their efforts in it were never truly forgotten."

While often compared with its Saloreni cousin, the Roilsardi wine was usually stronger with a higher alcohol content. It was often served with traditional roasted foods which were popular among the Roilsardi. It was especially popular among the commoners, yet the upper class enjoyed it similarly and did not regard it as a "peasant drink". One could say that love for Roilsard wine brought national unity for the Roilsardi."
 A78_minaran_cult:0 "The Cult of Minara"
 A78_minaran_cult_desc:0 "Minara was an especially popular goddess among the Roilsardi. She resonated with the Roilsardi not only because of their love of grand celebrations with copious amounts of wine, but also because of the Roilsardi tradition of having large families. Child-making was less of a taboo in Roilsardi culture than elsewhere, and while this resulted in foreigners regarding them as debauched, it did also increase Roilsard's population as long as there was enough food to feed everyone."

While many initial settlers perished, eventually large Roilsard communities sprung up in Aelantir, just like they had sprung up in the Borders during the Aldresian Crusade. The Roilsardi colonists would retain their distinct cultural identity to this day, albeit most of them have no desire to return to their homeland."

This later led to conflict with their fellow Wexonards and other neighbours, who changed sides to support the Rose party instead. From Bisanese perspective, they were fighting against traitors, but their righteousness did not bring them victory.

While many of the elves assimilated into the human populace, their descendants becoming half-elves, a small enclave of urban elves remained in the heart of Aelthíl. They were called Glassweavers due to their skill of using magic to create elaborate items from glass, so beautiful and intricate that they were famed well beyond Bisan itself.\n\nWhile the Wexonards do show a colder reception to the elven race, the Counts of Bisan have generally allowed them great autonomy and benefits - either due to Bisan's pro-Damerian leanings, or perhaps coin that fills their coffers."

Their small hands were helpful with the intricacies and allowed corsets to have much smaller lacings. Corsets were fashionable among noblewomen and the demand for high-quality Corseton corsets brought considerable wealth into Bisan.\n\nHowever, there is also a more morbid origin to the city's name. Many know of The Necropolis that dominates the city, which was, for a longest time, the largest temple of Nerat's faith until the Bone Citadel in Aelantir, but only historians know that Nerat was not a god of a pre-Elikhet Kheterata, but was in fact a death god imported by Milcorissian slaves. This fact became widely spread in the 16th century when adventurers uncovered ancient Milcorissian burial grounds in Corseton, containing corpses posed with corsets, leading to the curiously macabre realization that the name for corsets came from corse, an archaic word for corpse."

In 1403 AA, Count Harold the Fourth gathered the army to seize Gnollsgate and bring an end the gnollish menace. The hill gnolls were beaten in several decisive battles and Gnollsgate was secured under Bisanese rule.\n\nThus Harold IV earned the title of "Gnollcutter", becoming one of the most famed military leaders of Bisan's history. His bold tactics continued to influence the Bisanese army for many centuries to come."

However, many remained loyal to Adean, and soon religious tensions erupted between the two groups like they did elsewhere in Cannor. The Bisanese solved the problem like how they usually did, with violence. In the night of 7th of Nerament 1576, the eve of Lansday, the Corinite faithful struck at the Adeanic nobility. The outbreak of assassinations and mob violence resulted in thousands of deaths and crippled the power of the Adeanics, securing Corinite control of Bisan."

While initially loyal, tensions soon started to rise due to various disputes - most importantly, the taxation of salt production. Weary of Arannese arrogance and their desire to dominate the Borders, the Gisdenese secretly betrayed their overlords by joining the Rose Party during the Lilac Wars. Gisden fought alongside Wex, Sugamber and Toarnen against Arannen, Asheniande and Celliande.

Therefore Count Austyn II of Gisden welcomed newcomers from the west, many of whom were Alenic Wexonards. The Gisdenese mixed with the new settlers and soon became rather distinct from their other Arannese neighbours, despite still having much in common. This helped with the formation of a distinct Gisdenese identity, which was a combination of Milcorissian and Wexonard traits.

The tradition of herblore is strong in the Gisdenese commonfolk, and many learn in their youth to heal wounds with extracts from the roots of the creeping cinquefoil. This medicinal knowledge was put to use during the White Pestilence, when the Gisdenese mass produced the cure created by Garion the Wise. This was also when the elves first settled in Gisden and founded the Guild of the Silver Cinquefoil, an organization of potion makers and healers.

And this they did, their talented artisans crafting fine copper items in their makeshift workshops. The people were pleased and the Counts kept their promise.

This tradition didn't exist merely among the commoners, but even amongst the half-elven nobility, as foreign dignitaries and visiting monarchs were given the same gift. It was said the Gisdenese were the most friendly folk in the Borders, and most welcoming to strangers. However, violating this hospitality was a quick way to become a despised outlaw."

When the two eventually launched a surprise attack from two directions simultaneously, the Gisdenese defenders fought back valiantly despite being greatly outnumbered. With the support of local farmers and their allies, Gisdenese soldiers waged a brutal guerilla war against the occupiers. While they ultimately failed to repel the invaders and Count Austyn V was deposed, the resistance strengthened Gisdenese identity and led to concessions of local autonomy from the occupiers."

The Orcs took to blaming these attacks on “Sarmozd Arvakh” - frozen ghosts in the common tongue.\n\n Officially, there are no frozen ghosts, and if they did exist, the leadership of Esald would do everything in their power to protect their new overlords. Unofficially, many locals are quite discontent with serving those who just decades ago ravaged the land, and local mercenaries, spies, and assassins have taken matters into their own hands."

New blood, new structures, and new guilds revitalized the city and made it shine like never before.\n\nThey renamed the city Garok, and Garok now glows where the ashes of Esald once burned. Under this new dawn, the city grew to double the size it had been before the rebellion, and in 1506 King Gunk chose the renewed city to be the capital of the Grombari state."

While king Marr believed griffons to be just another pest, Ulric believed that these griffons were essential to protect the nation from another dragon's wrath. He was the first human to train a griffon, and down the line he created the first elite division of griffon cavalry.\n\nIn more recent times, Griffon riders are made up of Marrhold nobles and commonborn knights who had proven their worthiness of riding a griffon with an exceptional act of valor in the battlefield.

The Marrhold militia was able to cross through secret tunnels while the capital was being sieged, and by morning the Blademarcher king found himself cut off from his supply line and surrounded on both sides. The subsequent surrender of the Blademarches shocked all of Cannor, and Marrhold gained immense prestige as a nation 'nigh impossible to siege'.

In the 17th century, however, the grand reopening of the Marrhold tunnel changed and boosted trade between dwarves and humans.

And then came down the sky what looked like a lighting, followed by a deafening but oddly musical roar of thunder. The Silver Dragon of Castanor, the legendary Avatar of Castellos, who helped Castan I at Burning Hill, was coming to our help again - and began to fight with Zaamalot.\n\n'I knelt before the glistening silhouette instinctively, amazed at the creature's might and beauty. For once, the sight of dragonfire filled me with hope, and the flames reflected on his scales, shining so brightly that it seemed dawn had come for a moment. Two years after the end of the Dragonwake, I still feel blessed by this memory. All of our people should feel blessed that twice in history, Castellos himself appeared in the form of the Silver Dragon to save Castanor from a horrible end.'\n\n-Autobiography of Castan XXXVII the Rebuilder"

Hence, when Castanor was rebuilt from its ashes, it was clear to all that the new Castan lacked a fitting crown. From today on, this will not be the case.\n\nOut of silver and mithril, in one year of work, our best smiths forged a huge majestic crown. At the base, shining brightly, is a circlet sculpted to depict the White Walls. Surmounting each tower of the circlet are statues of the gods of the Cannorian Pantheon, encrusted with innumerable jewels. At the center, linked to the interior of the wall by bands of metal, lies an astonishingly accurate representation of Trialmount, topped with a huge diamond!\n\nBut that is not all, as there are actually two different parts in this masterpiece! Our smiths forged a splendid miniature dragon, and the most talented enchanter of our realm created an invisible magic link between the two parts, so that the dragon can levitate atop the crown! The mighty Silver Dragon of Castanor deploying its wings around Castan's head as he speaks is truly a sight to behold."

Many of the cities were sacked amidst the "Typhoon of Broken Vases," as the infamous event became known, but not Semphrerong — it just happened that the city was between contracts, for the first time in centuries. It was manning its walls with a smattering of other mercenaries, and so was passed over amidst the chaos."

However, none have yet succeeded in opposing it, for they have yet to create a unified force against it."
 J49_defend_secrets: "Defend Our Secrets"
 J49_defend_secrets_desc:0 "Insight V: Secrecy\nKnowledge is one’s greatest asset, and it is something that can rarely be afforded, instead it is gathered with time and effort. A craftsman is not valued for his tools but his expertise. To ensure the knowledge of the state remains valuable, it must be kept secret. Our actions are easily befuddled if one can learn of them in a measly tavern or with a well-placed bribe."
 J49_endless_assault: "Endless Assault"
 J49_endless_assault_desc:0 "Insight VI: Relentlessness\nTo win in conflict, one must simply outlast one’s  opponent.

While the common people celebrated their democratic history, many of the nobility have longed for the consistency a monarch brings. Now that we have given them this opportunity, their enthusiasm will be our foundation of strength."
 J50_modern_governance: "Modern Governance"
 J50_modern_governance_desc:0 "While many consider the system of monarchy to be antiquated, to us it represents a new potential for our people. In their commitment to democracy the cities of Sätsare allowed their republics to stagnate into uncompetitive oligarchies, and now we offer a new way forward. When the leadership of the state is known in advance by birthright, those who once squabbled for power can instead devote themselves to the betterment of the nation."
 J50_regal_courts: "Regal Courts"
 J50_regal_courts_desc:0 "While some may consider the process of a ballot effective, it does not come close to the majesty of a royal court. When attempting to get your way diplomatically, it pays to be able to impress foreign diplomats with lavish decorations and appropriate cultural dress. When they return home to deliberate in their sovereign's court, it shall be ours that dwells on their minds."
 J50_zealous_march: "Zealous March"
 J50_zealous_march_desc:0 "It is easier for troops to fight when they know what it is that they fight for. In ages past they fought for survival or for petty strife between cities, out of desperation or obligation. Our men fight for glory, their nation, and the crown. To these higher callings they find pride, and find it easy to send those without such purpose away from the field of battle."
 J50_glorious_reign: "Glorious Reign"
 J50_glorious_reign_desc:0 "To many 'Glory' is hard to define, but they know it when they see it in the fine architecture built by kings past that stands to this day. Despite their previous detestation of monarchy they found pride in the monuments it helped erect, and in this identity the novel crown shall find strength from its distant predecessors."
 J50_loyal_troops: "Loyal Troops"
 J50_loyal_troops_desc:0 "There are few qualities more valuable in a soldier than loyalty. Loyalty is what keeps a fighter fighting for one cause, it is what drives them to stand by their compatriots, and it is what keeps them on the march under our banner.

 J51_yyl_moitsa_lumber_desc:0 "We are situated just a short boat trip away from the massive forests of Yyl Möitsa. While logging operations have been established by the Metsamic cities in the past, they were small and disparate, and would often compete with each other for land and wood. Now that we are united and our dominance over the Blue Sea is secure, operations can finally start in earnest. The entire forest is ours for the taking, and its wood shall be used to build the cabins of our new settlements and the ships that will defend them."
 J51_merchant_families: "Rise of the Merchant Families"
 J51_merchant_families_desc:0 "With our newfound dominance of the seas and exploitation of the forests, we have seen a dramatic increase in the wealth of our merchants. As the houses that pioneered these developments rise in both wealth and influence, and successful merchants establish brand new houses, the families who fail to capitalize on the new opportunities fall into irrelevance."
 J51_cold_north: "Fortress of Wood and Snow"
 J51_cold_north_desc:0 "Yyl Möitsa is a cold and harsh place. While the Kukatodics were exterminated by the stronger ogres and centaurs in the west and south, in the north they were able to use the very forest and winter itself to defend themselves. We should combine this hard-earned wisdom with our knowledge of modern warfare to defend our mainland territories. Our enemies shall find nothing but cold and starvation; even if we have to destroy our own roads, break our own bridges, and torch our own cabins to make it so."
 J51_humble_crown: "Ceremonial Crown"
 J51_humble_crown_desc:0 "While most Triunics see their old monarchs as oppressors and tyrants, we have fonder memories. The people of Vantnhasadma know it was the Oldkings who built their great city from nothing. Stories of the Iron Kings’ strength are still told in Raattakod. The Raven Kings would bravely risk their lives every year for the people of Länkinä. And House Semaas still rules the hearts of Valralahdi centuries after giving up rule of the city itself. But we should never let this fondness make us forget our modern liberties. The king of Möitsakyva has certain ceremonial and administrative rights and duties, but executive control of the state must always lie with our elected officials."
 J51_not_forbidden: "Bridge Between Worlds"
 J51_not_forbidden_desc:0 "For as long as history can remember, the Triunics have been largely isolated from the outside world. Yyl Möitsa, Moduk and the Forbidden Plains were endless walls that separated us from other civilizations. Yet our expansion has made us venture beyond these walls once and for all. Our ships regularly sail all the way to Yanshen, and our pioneers in Yyl Möitsa rub shoulders with both the Cannorians and the emerging kingdoms of the Serpentspine. We have now become the bridge that connects the Triunic Lakes to vastly different ends of the world."
 J51_modern_diplomacy: "Global Diplomacy"

 J52_workshops_enuuk: "Workshops of Enuuk"
 J52_workshops_enuuk_desc:0 "When the civilization of the Khaashalg collapsed as the skies turned to ash, it was Enuuk who taught us how to rebuild what was lost. Over a millennium of practice the cities surrounding her lake became the most impressive of the Federation, and now as we return to where it began we bring these lessons with us, not only to rebuild, but build better than what came before."
 J52_longbarrel_cannons: "Longbarrel Cannons"
 J52_longbarrel_cannons_desc:0 "As Ianakal lacked a supply of war-worthy iron, what little artillery we could muster was made from bronze, and even then they were smaller than what distant lands could produce. As we find mineral wealth across Nuzurbokh, the potential to build larger cannons opens a new form of warfare to us, one where volleys can be launched from a safe distance and decimate a foe before it can even engage us."
 J52_ancestral_connections: "Ancestral Connections"
 J52_ancestral_connections_desc:0 "The presence of tangible spirits in other regions of Haless has influenced their very way of life. While we have worshiped the Goddess Enuuk, there are many in these lands who do not recognize a divine figure, or only perceive them in connection to the spiritual world. Even our ancestors once worshipped the Supreme Spirit now known as Umon Omi, and some today even consider it the progenitor of Enuuk.\nRegardless of these discrepancies, we have much to learn from the locals of the lands we seek to incorporate into our new nation, and nothing to gain from persecution."
 J52_banking_systems: "Ultakal Minting"
 J52_banking_systems_desc:0 "While Ultakal has produced gold for coinage for over a thousand years, it has never been consistently owned by one state until now. This allows us to establish monetary policy with far more effectiveness than any individual city ever could, for the supply of currency lies exclusively at the state level. With this monopoly, procuring payment for major projects becomes a matter of producing the appropriate coinage and using it to pay laborers."
 J52_new_administration: "Twin Administration"
 J52_new_administration_desc:0 "Not since the Ashen Migration have the Khamgunai been in a state consisting of more than one major city. This fact alone has fostered a need for administrative reform, and it must also be able to manage the less urban lands of Nuzurbokh. To solve both of these problems we have adopted the Dazarnuuk administration, to ensure effectiveness of policy both on the lakes and the interior lands."

 J53_return_taqoshur: "Old Sun Rising"
 J53_return_taqoshur_desc:0 "While the goddesses of the lakes are closely associated with the Triunics, they were not the first gods worshiped by our people. Inscribed on ruins across the endless grasslands are the rites of our forefathers, and highest among them are those towards Taqoshur, the sun above our heads and the source of all life and civilization.\nWhile it was behind mother Yukel's waves that we bided our time, it is under Taqoshur's glow that we face our destiny head-on."
 J53_mounted_warfare: "Mounted Warfare"
 J53_mounted_warfare_desc:0 "While the forests, hills, and cities of Leloyal inhibited the movements of cavalry, the open steppe demands the free movement only a mount can provide. While we have yet to master this form, you need only look to a pack of centaurs to learn the role of mobility in combat. To have your enemy surrounded is to have effectively won a battle before it has even begun, and to retain the ability to flee from an advancing foe ensures total defeat is an impossibility. Let no Orachav fight with their feet upon the ground, and they will never be vanquished."
 J53_horse_gunners: "Qultiqatish"
 J53_horse_gunners_desc:0 "While the physically stronger centaur has been the master of hectic warfare, the introduction of the firearm has returned the advantage to us. Their charges across the field of battle mean little now that we can drop them dead from a distance, which we can maintain upon our own steeds. While some have learned to fire a bow from atop a horse, the effectiveness of the gun will multiply that technique tenfold."
 J53_aid_tayoghor: "Aid the Blessed Warrior"
 J53_aid_tayoghor_desc:0 "As we reclaim our own ancestral lands from those that took it from us, the stout inhabitants of the mountains surrounding us have begun to do the same. Tayoghor, a god of such proportions, embodies this desire to protect our lands from that which threaten it, and to enrich ourselves from the bounty of our land. Any who fight against the forces of evil and disaster are a friend to the Orachav, and any skilled warrior can find a home among us."
 J53_well_traveled: "Well Traveled Armies"
 J53_well_traveled_desc:0 "When a lone Orachav travels, knowing how much food to carry can be a matter of life and death, for the nearest supplies could be days away. When a group travels, herd animals may be brought along, but in the haste of war this luxury cannot be afforded. While horses can tilt their necks and feast upon grass at a moment's notice, our men must be prepared for weeks of travel and know how to prepare for it."

When terrain is not limited, the formations of friend and foe alike.

 J32_our_swamp_desc:0 "The flooded lands of the Serpent’s Vale are a nightmare to trudge across, but not for us Mossmouth, as we have adapted to the terrain of their great swamp. Orcish raiders would often try to invade, yet the terrain bogged them down enough to let us easily club them to death.\n\nWe created pits of sharpened logs that lay across the seemingly safe paths, enough to fool any invader that would dare to follow us Mossmouth back to our homes. We cover ourselves in dirt and moss to lay in ambush as well, pretending to be rocks or mounds, yet our smell could be the only giveaway."

 J32_fernmunchers_desc:0 "The one exception we have to the interlopers within the swamp are the goblins of the Fernmuncher clan, whom the great Chief Shrakk integrated after his efforts to unify the Mossmouths. They were at first slaves to the orcs, kept around as scouts to navigate the swamps, utilising their small stature to sneak by traps and ogres.\n\nHowever, as the goblins could not turn the tide in invading the ogrish lands, they began defecting to the Mossmouth to escape being lowly slaves to the orcs. With goblin cooperation and vow of servitude without chains, they taught the mossmouth the art of extortion instead of direct raiding. With this, the goblins would go and threaten surrounding enemies with ogre clubbing if they didn’t depart with all of their riches."

 J32_chosen_by_the_mire_desc:0 "By Mossmouth tradition, to become the next leader of our clan, an ogre must first travel around the Serpent’s Vale and eat the various plants that grant visions, to gain immunity to disease and poison. One such vision as described by Shrakk described him travelling alongside a donkey to rescue the princess of a kingdom far away, while others showed him expelling trespassers from our swamp.

Irritated by their presence, many ogres started destroying the pipework only to discover that their destruction only led to more flooding. What began as wrecking turned into the study of the various mechanisms to further expand our swamp and grow our clan to new heights."

 G25_imperial_heartland_desc:0 "The area surrounding the cities of Vareynn, Stantirshalas and Bostynn is known historically as Trojvare, or “Three Cities" in Dolindhan, which formed the original nucleus of the ancient Kingdom of Vareynn that rose to unify the entire Ynn River into a great Empire, beginning with its conquests in the early fourth century and finishing in the seventh century with the total submission of the Sarda.\n\nOf the three, Stantirshalas was the oldest and most central settlement, often mediating issues between its two “Little Sisters" up and down the stream and making sure that they remained united in the face of danger and hardships. And while it was Vareynn that created an empire, nobody can understate the role Stantirshalas played in safeguarding Vareynn up to that point."

Only after the barycenter of the Empire had shifted south to the lands of the Sarda, did they break free along the rest of Dolindha. To this day, “to be a Stantirshalan" means to be helpful and supportive, loyal to a fault and never shifting in your allegiances."

Built over the narrowest portion of the eastern Ynn River, the city faded in importance already during Imperial times, when Emperor Armynn II ordered the construction of the massive Bosancovac Dam, a project which once completed opened up a second, much larger passage downstream. We will tear down the old Bostynn Bridge, and, using the most lavish materials our coffers can import as well as advice from Cannorian engineers, we will build a new splendid bridge that will signal a new start for the town, and help revitalize the local economy."

 G25_bostynn_bridgewardens_desc:0 "This has to be said - the whole reason the Bosancovac Dam was built, was because two Imperial functionaries had been thrown off the Bostynn bridge, then the city refused to apologize for the incident! In a stark contrast to us, Bostynn has always been the home of fierce, outright obstinate people, who jumped at every opportunity to revolt, forming impromptu bands of peasant warriors who ransacked the countryside until the Imperial army would inevitably arrive to put them down.\n\nThe "Bridge-Wardens" were experienced hunters who frequently put themselves at the head of those revolts and, when not busy leading, constituted the best archers available north of Arverynn. Many often joke that had it not been for the usefulness of the Bridge-Wardens, the city of Bostynn would have been razed to the ground centuries ago."

While nobody contests that Stantirshalan produce is of far higher quality, it would be foolish to let ourselves fall behind in quantity: we shall invite some Cannorian farmers as honourary guests to our harvest festivals, where, under the effect of the beer - and the sense of commonality brought by our festivities - it'll be easy for them to open up and share the secrets of their craft."

Before any more Rzentur, new or old, gets the idea to invade us, we should act preemptively: many Old Rzentur tribes would like nothing more than to settle the lands of their cousins to the south, and some of our "traders" will make sure to provide them with the motivations and means to do so."

In order to keep up with this stream of challengers, mandatory training sessions will be scheduled, where our knights will be brought up to date with the latest fencing techniques, riding formations, and fighting tactics of the enemies.

When King Jeborad crossed the Ynn at Vels Bacar to conquer southward, he did so coming to the aid of his allies in Stanyrhrada.

And as they argued, the Bacaran allies, the Amstenuri, lost a battle they had to fight on their own and found themselves besieged.\n\nIn the second phase of the war, Bacaran sentries kept watch and made fortifications over the fords of Arverynn while their main force engaged the Stanyrhradans, seeing some successes. It was all for nothing when, in 572, Jeborad took the city of Vels Bacar by the storm using a path nobody had foreseen: a massive pontoon bridge had been built in just seven days from one statue of Filenval to the other, and, with the cover of the mist that in rainier days makes it impossible to see the other side of the Ynn, nobody in Vels Bacar noticed Vareynn's soldiers and riders atop their massive antler horses suddenly charging in before it was too late.\n\nThe lesson our marshals have drawn from all this is thus: “Time is of essence.""

And while the first elections were held successfully to the cheer of the people, this move was deeply unpopular with many Sarda neighbours, who called the new republic an anachronism and a betrayal of Ynnic values in favour of Cannorization. Thus began the War of the Bacaran Succession, where Lord Calrodiy V of Arverynn pressed the claim of a vassal of his to rule Vels Bacar.\n\nThe war soon escalated, involving not only Sarda, but also many frontiermen nations and even the Mayor of Valorpoint and the Gospodh of the Rzentur. In the final stages of the war, kobold snipers were picking off Escanni knights and dwarven cannons mercilessly bombarded the walls of Vels Bacar, as other dwarves on the Bacaran side rebuilt them each day and night. The war lasted for 21 years and saw Vels Bacar besieged five times, ending only after the death of a million people and Vels Bacar's destruction.

Founded in the sixth century after Flood, they contained pieces from further back, like Hrolatas's very first account on the Epednar from 350, Pelovit's detailed chronicles of the Hundred Years' Uprising told from both Vareynn's and Malacnar's perspectives, the constitution of the Trojvare league from 204 and even texts from before the Ending Flood such as the theories of Telaryos yen Arafthil, a powerful water mage who argued water was the most magical of elements.\n\nHowever, these texts would be the Archives' downfall, as in 1023 the western bank of the Ynn was seized by the fanatical movement of the Mun Pienik, who sang to the moon in an attempt to bring forth the second Ending Flood. Seeing the world of present and past as irredeemably evil, they targeted the Archives for containing memories of the world and its sins, and blasted the building into the Ynn River.\n\nSome books could be salvaged, but most were lost or made unreadable after they had been fished out of the Ynn. No effort was made to restore those books, but recently some councillors have advised our Lord that, with the arrival of so many new people to the Epednan prairie, new Archives detailing their differences would be most useful. While we may never restore those unreadable books, we can seek knowledge from our neighbours, and see if their stories match with ours and can be used to help reconstruct them; perhaps, along the process, we will accumulate so much new knowledge, the resulting Archives will be even greater than the old ones."

Taking his advice, I ordered Ivrandir to cast an invisibility spell on me and the party, and we took a deviation to stop following the course of the Ynn River, moving northwest further inland to skirt along Arganjuzorn's borders.\n\nEvidently, that wasn't enough, for I was ambushed (…)\nWhen I woke up, my hands were tied and I was on a carriage, and I couldn't see my party anywhere.

Because of her selfless gesture, her soul was made to return to this world time and time again in the form of a guardian spirit who travels along the River.\n\nVen Eranelas's travel, from the spring of the Velenynn river to the Divine Waterfall past Adbrabohvi, begins each year with her ritual Drowning in Fadhevych: first, a sarcophagus bearing her likeness is crafted, then children who can afford gifts - flowers, effigies, drawings of the heroine - fill the sarcophagus with them.

When the War of the Bacaran succession erupted in 1602, Mitrenya was already a consummate war veteran, having led incursions into the Epednar territories over the past two decades, going as far as to reach the recently-founded city of Pelodaire during one of them.\n\nIt was thus to everyone's surprise when she announced she would maintain her neutrality during the Bacaran conflict.\n\nTwenty years later, when the war was over, a shocking discovery was made: Mitrenya had been torturing the prisoners made during her past incursions, as well as some of her subjects and even relatives of her vassals. Not satisfied with water magic anymore, she would finish torturing them only to kill them then bathe in their blood; drawing power from it, using it to strengthen her magic and stay young forever.\n\nWith most of the Ynn still recovering from war, nobody moved to oppose Mitrenya, except for Vyr Arok yen Clovenvels, a mercenary captain of Escanni origin who ventured into the forests of Vels Fadhecai and defeated her many minions.

 H26_rhymes_of_rhovynuc_desc:0 "Rhovynuc, a corruption of “Rohavy Buycev”, “Savage Horse”, was the fake name of Yarhel Yonnasik, an infamous bandit leader active from 613 to 644.\n\nBeginning his career during the aftermath of the Dolindhan conquest of Sarda, Yarhel's legend begins with the theft of an entire herd of antler horses, and he used them to form a robber band in the woodlands of the southern Ynnic Empire. Though some claimed he was little more than another beast to be found in the woods near Vels Domfan, in truth he and his band adopted the chivalric values of their Dolindhan conquerors: never using violence when scare tactics would do, providing the poor with food stolen from the rich, and protecting the locals from any (other) prowling monsters.\n\nRhovynuc evaded imperial capture for decades, until betrayal saw him captured and executed. But to this day, his legend lives on, ever-popular with our playwrights and bards and inspiring all who hear of him."

 H26_vote_with_your_feet_desc:0 "A common saying in Vels Domfan is that if people are unhappy with their lot in life or with the current mayor’s policies, they should just leave, thus “voting with their feet”. While other lords would spend much time and fanfare to justify their wisdom, benevolence and the oh so many accomplishments of their house, the mayors of Vels Domfan know but a simple spell against the angry masses. A powerful one, that leaves them free to deal with more serious matters.\n\nBeing spared from Emperor Calrodiy I’s reform which enforced serfdom throughout most of Sarda in 894, Vels Domfan’s territory has dearly clung onto its social mobility. Why repress troublemakers or try to convince them of your benevolence, when you can simply export them away? The holy Ynn is limitless and ever-welcoming, or so the Adbrabohvir river-priests next door say."

Many noble clans are willing to defend Vels Domfan, and during peacetime they perform as traders and road-guards, gaining extra revenue which helps pay for them and recruit even more knights.\n\n“Departing Adbrabohvi, we were informed that the next settlement was a town named Vels Domfan, meaning "Forest Home", and were advised to keep to the beaten path on the way there. My party was surprised to discover that the namesake forest of Vels Domfan was patrolled by a great number of native knights, which was a sharp contrast from the forests of Noruin where no native horse lived.\n\nThose Ynnic knights rode great antlered horses, wielded swords or long knives, wore leather or iron armours and protected their heads with antlered helmets. While the craftsmanship of their equipment was crude and lacked the true elven finesse of Ibevari or Lorentish knights, and they lacked technology such as stirrups and couches, they still carried themselves with elegance, donning vibrant milk-green cloaks, and their numbers were great like the armies of Adenica and Enteben of old."\n\n-Report on the Ynn River and its People, Adrien síl Terr, Cannorian Explorer, 1557"

These glass coins are as durable as they are beautiful, thanks to the labour of a dedicated order of mage-crafters, and they used to be found as far north as Svemel and Vareynn.\n\nIn 908 Emperor Calrodiy II, struck by the beauty of our coins, ordered that they become the standard currency across the Ynnic Empire - a choice which proved to be wise, as growing hostilities with the Epednar tribes would soon disrupt the trade of gold arriving from the western mountains, which our coins only use a small quantity of.\n\nBut in a twist of fate that would make Rhovynuc proud, our Green-Gold Mint would also be the final nail in the coffin of the Ynnic Empire, when in 1203 Emperor Fineas, ruling over a rump state limited to the Sarda region, tried to enforce serfdom in our territory and demanded the relocation of the mint to Arverynn. In response, Vels Domfan interrupted the supply of coins to the Imperial coffers, and in the ensuing collapse two years later, Emperor Fineas would go down in history as Fineas the Lynched."

Ultimately, he was able to pioneer the adoption of the stirrup, new banking techniques, and partnership systems across the Ynn.\n\nDespite being born from humble origins, Trhevyr was able to make a respectable fortune for himself: when he returned home to Thromshana in 1583, he paid for the construction of a palace and decorated it with Moon Elven artwork he purchased. Many were finally interested in the tales the so-called "Mad Merchant" could tell, and by the time of Threvyr's death, the letters to and from fellow merchants (and even a few Ynnic nobles) in his palace's archive numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

Working with a Fadhevychi noblewoman, they adapted the game for Ynnic audience through several revisions: antlers were added to the knight pieces, the pointy head of the rook was swapped with the round head of the pawn and vice versa, and the King and Queen were renamed Overlord and Iosahar.\n\nNaturally, these adaptations were to be just the beginning, as Ynnic play-testers suggested the addition of a “motivation system" to the game, whereby chess pieces could refuse orders that would result in their own destruction, and a “politics system", whereby the Iosahar piece could overthrow the Overlord. A Dolindhan suggested that the stronger the will of a piece is, the more damage it could inflict to the opposing side, and that this could be raised by giving rousing speeches. A Trompolerey noblewoman arrived, and she suggested that the game could be performed on special occasions by live actors dressing in costumes.\n\nTo the noblewoman's dismay, the mere suggestion was the last straw for the overworked human siblings: the two speedily resigned and rode out of town, settling to live a quiet life in Tellumtir where they could sustain themselves by winning scraps at the saloons, rather than enduring the cost to their freedom that came with living in the more luxurious Ynnic communities."

All of these dynasties have earned the title of “Everlasting" through their centuries of history, and it would be a scandal if they were succeeded by someone with the wrong hair colour all of a sudden.\n\nSarda families thus follow an “Authenticity" method of succession, where firstborn sons and daughters of a mismatched hair colour are passed over in favour of the child whose hair shade is most authentic to the colour of their family or community, and if none is available, marriages and adoptions can always be arranged."

 U69_seltac_waystations_desc:0 "The Ynnic Empire spanned an enormous territory, and it was hard to maintain communication from one end to another. While you could always send a canoe courier if you were in a hurry, this bore the risk of the canoe getting destroyed by a river monster along the route. The Imperial fleet, lacking enemies to strike out against after the Ynnic Empire's unification, was deemed too costly to maintain and the emperors looked for a solution.\n\nThat solution presented itself in 633, when the Champion of the Ynn encountered an enigmatic Sarda known as 'the Striding Man' who spent his days trekking for miles across Sarda. While the tale of him outrunning the Champion's horse is almost certainly an exaggeration, the Champion was nonetheless impressed enough that he vouched for him with the Empress, and the idea of the Selin Prealtac - “Way Outposts", Seltac for short - was born.\n\nThe Ynnic Empire became thus connected through a network of waystations which relayed messages from one end to the other, similar to the Treehouse Striders of Sarda tradition, but augmented by the new steeds Dolindhans brought. As to the Imperial fleet, its vessels would be later repurposed to funerary barges, and they would meet a gradual, dignified end throughout the reign of Emperor Gamelirn the Pious."

The Cannorians readied their rifles and pointed at our lines, as doubt began to seep among our fighters.\n\nAnd then… it rained. One of the strongest rains seen in Sarda downpoured with no warning over the battlefield, sabotaging the mechanisms of the Cannorian guns and sweeping away the stakes.

Legends speak of ancient antler horses being able to talk, being able to select people for their nobleness and virtue, just like people selected horses for their strength and speed.\n\nThis "force" allowed Ynnic knights to practice for the longest time a hybrid cavalry-foot technique, known as Leomarc, the "Charge-Jump": charging into battle without stirrups nor lances, Ynnic knights hurled themselves into the air and into the fray before their steed collided into the enemy lines, and as the knight began cutting down his many enemies his antler horse would gore and trample to death just as many."

We would be wise not to take all those claims for granted, however it would be needlessly arrogant to write them all off as trouble-making outsiders.\n\nCooperation with the Cannorians opens up a great deal of opportunities, especially if we take the time to break down such a catch-all grouping as "Cannorians" into more specific terms such as "Ebenmassers", "West Tipneyans" and "Beggastonics", to truly see which of these peoples are worthy of our time, and of one day becoming our peers as the backbone of the Ynnic Empire."

In order to counter this, the Haraf'ne have developed a special technique derived from the various shrubs and scarce trees of Haraf. A Watcher cannot take the spirit of something it cannot see, allowing one to surround themselves with thick, concealing smoke from the burning plants.

Despite their clear soullessness in refusing to allow a Kalun Spirit to inhabit their body, the many exiles and disenfranchised experts fleeing from sacrifice or worse in the Reaper's Coast to Haraf were a great boon to our slow attempts to organize our disparate people, as the exiles offered their service as advisors to the oldest of Kaluns in exchange for a home."

In the early days after our people inherited the world from the ancient gods, was Palaya Orenkoraim one of these wall-less cities. A warlord from Cankamam would take the city and mistreat its people, and from this situation a hero would rise.\n\nElrandar challenged the Cankamam warlord to personal combat for rule over the city, and despite the warlord calling upon the help of his companions Elrandar slew them all in a great feat of strength. Now Elrandar led the people of Palaya Orenkoraim to conquer Cankamam. After tearing down the walls and temples of Cankamam, the bricks would be moved along the Kalavend back to Palaya Orenkoraim. Using the stones of their walls and temples would Elrandar order the construction of thick durable walls that were made to reach the heavens, where Elrandar fights to this day after ascending to the gods.

Fearing his rule was coming to an end, he put it over the prosperity and honour of his people, and opened the gates of Palaya Orenkoraim so his new overlords could slaughter all who opposed his rule.

It was said that one of these bandit warbands could attack a town, wipe it of all worth, and leave for the next before word could get out.\n\nThough we are not bandits, and raiding has given way for actual warfare, these lessons were never forgotten.

One of the most important of his reforms was the creation of the "Woolen Cloaks", an appropriately named permanent army which he then put to work carving out a true domain, and a real city to govern it. After a long and successful reign, he ascended to godhood and his mortal form was buried in Hessamadha.\n\nMany of his reforms are, by modern standards, redundant and outdated.

If we have learned nothing from our legacy as bandits, it is that considering noblemen as the only candidates for leadership is lethal.\n\nIndeed, all individuals considered capable are valid candidates to command an army, and even the gentry has enough sense to know that the commoner in an otherwise "noble" occupation has earned their role.

A bloody chase by Alvarion’s soldiers followed where many Nakari lives were lost, but ultimately Alvarion was forced to retreat after nine tenths of his men were killed, bringing to Kortazel a paltry haul of bloodied wealth."

 G69_the_little_brother_desc:0 "Nakar Kilaiek is the remnant of Darandar’s faction in the breakup of Nanru Nakar. Following the death of Pelozhil Mudaliar during the second Larankarha War, his eldest son Elatam was the successor. While he was a skilled and effective administrator, his poor military leadership and the looming threat of Larankar led many to consider replacing him for the good of the realm.\n\nChief among these voices was Darandar. The youngest of Pelozhil’s sons, he was a skilled military leader, but was despised by the nobles and scavengers for his inflexible leadership. Darandar did not desire to rule and, instead, repeatedly requested his brother to give him control of the entirety of Nanru Nakar’s armies. He stated that with Larankar ready to invade again the armies needed a leader with experience in command. Elatam mistook the wishes of Darandar’s followers for the wishes of his brother, and attempted to arrest and execute him. Forced to flee for his life and fight his brother, he established his power base in Nakar Kilaiek and would personally train many officers who would lead under his banner."

The second was beaten back, with the aid of Royakottar and Orenkoraim who rightfully understood that if Nanru Nakar fell, they were next. This was not without cost, however; King Pelozhil Mudaliar was slain driving the Larankarha from our walls, setting the stage for the War of Three Brothers. Then, when Larankar came for the third time, there was no united Nanru Nakar, only three squabbling and tired brothers.\n\nThe outcome was obvious, and Nakar Kilaiek was forced to yield. Despite the high nobility’s valiant efforts, the officers of the lesser nobility and the ranks of peasant soldiers often broke before any advantage could be pressed. Worse, they  would cravenly quit the field before combat even began. Afterwards, the army of Nakar Kilaiek would shift focus from creating strong warriors to creating strong soldiers."

In the chaos of the Ruin she came, rising from the west with her host, and smote the ancient gods of the city of Nanru Nakar and gifted it to her people in perpetuity. For this glorious act she would ascend in their place as the new god of the new city. In Nakar Kilaiek, many seek to emulate her speed upon the battlefield, training constantly to improve their speed and endurance so that they may drive their enemies from the field of battle."

Whilst many were enraptured with the power of an arquebus, many officers and the Dhavana of Nakar Kilaiek saw the power of the cannon. Many of those great cannons were bought that day, and immediately artisans were set to work on determining how they were made.

Happily the Exemplars complied, seeing it as a means to weaken their enemy. This came to an end with the sack of Urvand. The Larankarha had taken much from us, and we wished for many relics that belonged originally to Nanru Nakar to be returned.\n\nThe Exemplars agreed, if we would only abandon our gods and embrace the light of their supposed one true god, Surael, and his herald and their namesake, Jaher. Such blatant hostage taking of our history could be neither stomached nor ignored. We seized the relics of Nanru Nakar and began the march home, but the Exemplars were faster. When the Exemplars reached the three Nakars, they divided themselves into three forces: their leader Kortazel would march on Nakar Mlerek, while two subordinates by the name of Pisandal and Alvarion led the assault on Nakar Kilaiek and Nakar Kriadvai respectively.\n\nPisandal began her assault on Nakar Kilaiek by seizing the slave markets and turning them against their masters. For weeks she ardently proselytized the Sun Cult to the slaves, declaring all could be free if they followed the Jaherians and converted. Though many slaves were recaptured as the Jaherians were expelled from Nakar Kilaiek, the blow struck deeper than burned buildings and pillaged temples. The worship of their Sun god, Surael, had spread among the Lai’i and Taychendi slaves. They had tasted the freedom of Jaher and in the countryside, with the looming threat of a slave revolt, the Dhavana of Nakar Kilaiek canonized Jaher as a divinity in order to appease the slaves and reluctantly gave them the ability to earn their freedom through restoring the damaged city and countryside."

When that damn crystal's light was shining in the crypt and the elven lady said we found God itself... We all felt it was the truth, but we didn't know what to think. My men and I are simple men: when we need money, we pray to Ara, when we're sick, to Nerat, or to Corin if we need to fight; but that... fragment of God, it was there!\n\nWhat we did know is that we were out of basically everything and further than the back of beyond, so we went to the nearest -relatively speaking- civilized settlement for supplies, a small wooden town named Cestirmark. The lady mentioned the significance of our operation to some official there. Now, I don't know exactly what Torrieth told him about our discovery.\n\nBut when they came back, he was rambling about some bright future. Gave her everything she asked for and more, even allowed us to set up a base on the coast a bit to the west of here. The place's bustling with adventurers and scholars who want to go inland walk the path of truth, to see the God Fragment, nowdays. Maybe that's why I decided to retire there. The air's nice, makes you don't want to ever leave."\n\n-Captain Vincen's diary, High Rectorate archives"

Thousands of faithful met a fate worse than death as their very souls were sacrificed to dark magic. Those who escaped had no place to return to, for Ionntrás had fallen to Esthíl's sorcerer armies. Desperate, the survivors rallied behind Father Godwin, a preacher who had received a vision of a new nation for the Corinite faithful, and fled Escann to seek this promised land in Aelantir.\n\nThe memory of the horror that brought them to Aelantir lingers in the minds of the Corinsfielders, and they deeply detest magic of all types.

Third was the perilous Cliffs of Ruin, which claimed a quarter of the remaining men in treacherous climb — and when they had been conquered, they were hounded north by tattooed warriors and horned monsters.\n\nThe few remaining Corinspilgrims were exhausted and nearly out of supplies when they came across a lush prairie filled with red flowers that resembled poppies. The beleaguered settlers took the sight as a sign from Corin that they had at last found their new home, and named the land Corinsfield, dubbing the flowers “Corin’s Poppies”. As the settlers soon found out, the crushed petals of the flowers could be used to make a deep red dye, which would soon become both the chief export of their burgeoning farmsteads and the symbol of their religious devotion.

As a result, the people of Corinsfield have become renowned sharpshooters, and any who would approach one of their fortified communities in war would do so under a hail of deadly-accurate musket fire."

 H35_the_red_sentries_desc:0 "The numbers of the Corinspilgrims were devastated by their long march, with less than half of their original number remaining by the time they arrived in their new home. The land itself was fertile and conducive to farming, and the need for many hands to work the fields led to a strong push for large families that would become integral to Corinsfielder culture. In the 1600s, the average Corinsfielder couple would have between 6 and 7 children, and families of 12 or more were not uncommon. Coupled with an early age of marriage, this tendency to large families led to a massive surge in population, and by the 1640s the Corynn river was one of the more densely populated tributaries of the Ynn.\n\nCorinsfield's insistence on firearms training was imposed upon its large population giving them a huge pool of potential soldiers to draw upon when the need to defend their community arose, and the militias of Corinsfield, colloquially called The Red Sentries, were always well staffed and swelled with sufficient recruits."

Every Sorrowday, Corinsfielders would gather at their meeting house or temple and join forces to work on a new community project, which could range from building a new house for a recently wedded couple or repairing the town’s waterwheel to laying down a new road or preparing collective food stores for the winter.\n\nThese constant community improvements would make the towns of Corinsfield quietly prosperous and constantly changing, and although they were never as grand as the big cities of Cannor or the Ynn proper, travelers would liken them to points of light in a dark and unforgiving world."

By and large, Corinsfielders believed that all men are created equally and no man must impose his will over another without their consent. Corinsfield placed great emphasis on this belief in their governmental and religious structures: their administrators and lawmakers were elected for brief terms and could be removed from office if they went against the will of the people. Their preachers were not ordained, but were instead regular members of the community, and all men were encouraged to read scripture, discuss, and come to their own conclusions about Corin’s faith."

But for Adrahel, it would be a short-lived one: the captain of the Corinsfielders, Ichabod Roose, questioned Adrahel during the extravagant victory party and came to the conclusion that the rebellion was motivated by nothing more than personal ambition, and so he seized Adrahel and executed him for his act of treachery.\n\nUnexpectedly to many, Adrahel's execution was met with applause by the Ynnics, who saw in the Corinites a possible saviour from the corruption rife in their land. By the end of the day the banners of Corinsfield flew over Fadhevych.\n\nAn emboldened Corinsfielder-Fadhevychi army pushed further into Sarda, onto the Ynnic holy city of Adbrabohvi, which surrendered quickly to avoid the destruction of millenia-old artifacts. Roose promised no harm would come to the city, but rogue Istranari seeking revenge for their failed crusade disobeyed and pillaged the city at night. Losing hope for a victory, the Sarda Emperor proposed an armistice and Corinsfield, already feeling overextended, swiftly accepted. The crusade was over, but the Ynn River Faith would never be the same."

Beyond his military achievements, Dak also implemented a complex system of administration. His influence, and thus his greatness, runs to the very core of what the Chaingrasper Clan is today."

However, they were not alone in their efforts to dominate the Tree of Stone. Ovdal Kanzad, sensing opportunity in the chaos of the disunity of the goblin clans in the western regions of the Tree of Stone had begun to expand once more.

This kind of control in goblin society can only be maintained via carefully ensuring that powerful goblins feel they have a measure of control. By setting the wealthy, intelligent, and powerful goblins against each other via the Granite Council, the Clanboss can maintain control while also staying well advised, showing favoritism and discarding the inconvenient as necessary to manipulate the Granite Council into following their vision."

The destiny of Clan Chaingrasper changed with the Week of Stabbings. Making use of his powerful magics, Dak would cast hexes, curses, and other malicious enchantments to bring his rivals to a gruesome end, often at the hands of their own people. This would culminate in a weeklong period of violence by Dak, as he used his magic to browbeat enough clans into submission, creating the Chaingrasper Clan as it is known today."

The mines have been divided between rival tribes, placed under the watchful eyes of Castanor's dwarves, split amongst squabbling patricians, siezed to bankroll Jexis' thirst for conquest, and suffered a thousand other fates in their unnumbered years. It was only under the care of the newborn Empire of Anbennar, in 1124 that Aramar's mines were for the final time placed in the care of a single entity, the Imperial Mint, under the watchful gaze of the High Fortuner of Ara.\n\nThrough the following centuries the Mint would grow in power, being handed a monopoly over the minting of all coin within the Empire in exchange for its flawless record of producing pure and undiluted coinage. Traders and banks throughout Anbennar, and even the whole of Cannor beyond are reticent to accept coinage with any stamp but that of the Imperial Mint."

The Everlucky Chargers are the pride of Aramar, sworn to preserve the prosperity their namesake delivered.\n\nThese paladins of Ara are tasked with seeing shipments from the Imperial Mint safely across Cannor, protecting the goddess' shrines, ensuring the smooth flow of commerce in the city and her lands, and taking up arms to defend Aramar in times of war."

Yet, these are not the only dealers of such dishonesty. Mortal merchants twist words, fudge numbers, plunge knives of usury and greed into the sacred union of seller and buyer that underpins all commerce.\n\nThe Aramari temple holds an ever-evolving codex of laws that serve to clamp down upon the greed of financiers, merchants, moneychangers, and other handlers of coin. While most punishments for these fiscal offenses are metered in fines and revocation of titles and property, none stand quite so infamous or prominent as dealings with and worship of Forsara.

And, in that time where the men of Cannor were barbaric nomads, it was found. The Cannorian intelligentsia first rediscovered this ancient lore in a tome produced by one of the Sorcerer King's Acolytes, and summarily, the secret of alchemy's great work was soon set to practice.\n\nThe bank-breaking, unending conflicts of the Wars of Rule set creditors into such a riotous state that most every side involved was employing their finest mages and alchemists in illicit minting, transforming base metals into coinage to bankroll their squabbles. With the abundance of gold flowing through the Empire, inflation shot to astronomical levels, and all sides of the conflict were threatened with the collapse of their economies, and the revolt of dissatisfied peasantry in numbers that even their most powerful mages couldn't crush.\n\nThusly, one of the few agreements found under the rule of Gracos I was the institution of the Charter of Aramar. With a new system of minting devised and implemented by the avatar Nathalara, each Crown crafted at the Imperial Mint would be infused with a distinct magical fingerprint, a universal mark that would show the coins as the sole legitimate tender within the Empire."

While some pursued the chivalric courts of far-flung Lencenor, Aramar plunged mountains of gold into quickly erecting sprawling tenements for Adean's folk, seeing that none would be denied a place amongst their number.\n\nNow, the city bustles and bulges with a fresh force of labor to hew her mines, and the teeming tenements brim with the sweet tunes of troubadours' tales of chivalry. Gratitude lingers among Adenners and other Escanni refugees, reclaiming her charitable image and seeing that the temple is owed many favors across the courts of Cannor."

Merchants, adventurers, thieves, and every sort who has known the razor-thin edge of fate pay their due to her, for on The Lady's whim lays fortune or fatality.\n\nIt is said that Ara is one of those lucky few mortals, alongside Munas and Balgar to ascend and stand amongst the gods of the Regent Court. While no histories of the distant time of her life have stood to the present, those theologians who have studied the ancient histories of Cannor have come to believe her to have lived the life of a nomadic chieftess during her time on Halann. The most prominent hypothesis arising from the prominence of Everlucky and the Horseshoe in her symbology, along with ancient relics and texts states that her domain had shifted alongside that of her people.\n\nTales from the days of Castanor, and records of discussion from the Pantheonic council recognizing her ascension hold that Ara's folk, now grown into the Crownsmen once wandered the land in a moving city of tents, so rich with the spoils of trade and plunder that one day, they found they could move no more, lest they abandon their fortune. Forced to forsake their nomadic lifestyle, Ara and her people developed from riders to merchants. However, they never lost the keen sense of adventure and eye for coin. Even with their new home, the followers of Ara continue to thunder across Halann in their unending quest for fortune, to keep the books of their fate forever in the black."

As a result, the use of banknotes was seen as impious and even heretical, so vicariously opposed by the Fortuners of Aramar that banks across Anbennar would be reticent to issue them, lest the flow of fresh coin from the Imperial Mint dry to a trickle. The Crown was the sole tender of Anbennar, and the Fortuners refused to see it masked in some Forsaric contract of flimsy paperwork.\n\nHowever, the Great Earthquake of 1672 would result in an ironic collapse. The mines of Aramar were wholly blocked by rubble, halting production, the city crawling to a halt when it most desperately needed an inflow of fresh currency to repair the damage inflicted by the disaster. The High Fortuner stood strong against any proactive changes, bringing the city to a boiling point. She was swiftly deposed in a coup by Ravelian sympathizers, who shortly issued the Proclamation of St. Aras.\n\nThe city would officially adopt the Ravelian faith, and the fortuners would integrate themselves into the hierarchy of the Church in exchange for the Rectorate's aid in rebuilding. The freshly minted Rector of St. Aras would issue a paper currency backed by the value of the gold in its mines, replacing the Gold Crown in a temporary measure that would come to stand in perpetuity."

The cost was paid with the Rail-tithe, a system where we extorted or forced any goblin clan or small enough orcish warband that wanted to move over the railways to give over a portion of their wealth and slaves.

They would suffer from this during the turbulent time following Jaher's assassination and Jaerel's civil war, as they did not retain any of the martial advantage they had been born with. So in 1131 AA, Yatasuo of the Divine Call travelled to Rahen, and would return five years later with a rekindled understanding of their ancient traditions.

Most famous of these is a special drug nicknamed Demon's Blood, produced only in Ilzin Mykx with a secret recipe.

Instead, Arawkelin gained a strong cadre of former legionaries as new officers and leaders for their armies, training the native Kelino to mimic the days of old.\n\nOver time, these sun elves would later return home to Bulwar peacefully, or go to Azkare for a true semblance of a sun elf-led state, but the country's reliance on foreign officers training a largely native force remained. Just as Arawkelin was one of the first to welcome Cannorian traders, they were also one of the first to adopt their ways of war, and even offered luxurious positions to veteran soldiers to train up their army in this new era of gunpowder warfare."

The home of a member of the clan will feature many coins hung or displayed as charms and effigies believed to bring luck and fortune. This focus on money means that many members of the clan are easily able to judge the wealth of any goblin, orc or dwarf, making Greedy Grin tax collectors frighteningly effective."

What started as a small, catchy tune by a single goblin shopkeeper to drive out his competitor's business has expanded into a complex industry of performers, poets, and singers for hire. This music of the shop is rapidly changing local economies, and upsetting the long standing and venerable tavern industry."

So, it should come as no surprise that the goblins of Clan Greedy Grin have made themselves a major part of that trade.\n\nRanging far and wide, the finest cultivars are acquired in one manner or another by various state-backed cartels.

 H85_idea_1_desc:0 "The Clanboss of the Truedagger Clan employs many assassins and cutthroats for punishing breakers of the law, or whoever happened to cross them that evening at dinner. To steal from the Clan, or worse, the Clanboss, is to invite a knife to your back and a garrote around your throat. Treason is even more ruthlessly punished, with the offending goblin or goblins having wire run through their arms, their legs broken, and then strung up on posts by earlier mentioned wire, dangling several feet in the air. Death is slow and cruel, and any attempting to aid the punished will instead join them."
 H85_idea_2:0 "Return of the Dwarves"
 H85_idea_2_desc:0 "With the emptying of the Serpentspine, the dwarves have returned. Many other clans may see this as a critical threat to our existence, as they come armed with new weapons, new tactics and far more zeal than the ancestors which fled to whatever misbegotten corner of the world they had dug to. However, dwarves are creatures of habit and tradition, and the importance they place on their reclamation can be exploited like any weakness. Should we have to combat them, we can easily divert their slavish devotion and short attention spans with a few dwarven “relics” here and there. They will naturally seek to recover what is essentially trash, dividing themselves before us."
 H85_idea_3:0 "Serpentspine Gladiatorial Sports"
 H85_idea_3_desc:0 "The goblins of Clan Truedagger are fond of many things, such as knives, darts, nets, and the like. They are just as fond of duels, brawls, and other expressions of violence, not even necessarily between two goblins. As of late, captured slaves, be they goblin, orc, or dwarf, are often pitted against each other in vastly publicized arena fights. Fights between beasts and monsters are also common, and slaves versus monsters is a particular favourite of the crowds. The less armed the slaves, the better. "
 H85_idea_4:0 "The Values of Cunning"
 H85_idea_4_desc:0 "Goblins are, generally speaking, very impatient. Many goblins are simply looking for a way to one-up their neighbor, or the quickest route to success. This is one of our people's greatest assets, as it drives us forward. But Clan Truedagger breeds a smarter goblin than the average. There is a time for patience and a time for expediency. Why rush, after all, if your opponent is doomed to fail? Especially when you can, with half the effort they put in, make them fall twice as far?"
 H85_idea_5:0 "Unrestricted Raiding"
 H85_idea_5_desc:0 "In warfare, nothing is fair. The enemy, regardless of their nature, must be broken in both body and spirit. There are many ways to achieve this, but one that Clan Truedagger finds particularly useful is raiding. By allowing our warriors unrestricted rights to pillage and plunder during campaigns is an excellent incentive to not only move quickly through territory, as their fellow soldiers also plunder the countryside, but keep morale high during sieges."
 H85_idea_6:0 "The Lessons of Leadership"
 H85_idea_6_desc:0 "What makes a leader worth following? Respect? Fear? Violence? The Clanboss of the Truedagger Clan must use a mixture of all three, but not always in equal measure. Sometimes, a Clanboss must be respected and feared, or feared and bloodied. Or violent and respected. A Clanboss who can use and be all three is a successful Clanboss, a Clanboss that fails to inspire these will not be Clanboss for long."
 H85_idea_7:0 "Clever Cannonfire"
 H85_idea_7_desc:0 "Goblins are fond of explosives, this is a simple, fundamental fact of our people. Finding ways to properly harness this fondness, however, is slightly more difficult. As it stands, cannons are bulky, heavy things unfit to be carried by a goblin. However, one tinkerer has happened upon a method of making a lighter cannon, capable of being carried by a team of eight goblins, two of which are reserved for carrying the powder and ammunition. Though small, these rapidly deployable cannons are capable of being set up in harder to reach places with enough preparation, allowing for devastating ambushes and clever cannonfire."

 H87_idea_1_desc:0 "The goblins of Clan Thieving Arrow were once part of the Goblin Exodus fleeing the chains of Korgus Dookanson. Unlike many other clans, however, we did not abandon our domain in the Serpentspine. Still, we find ourselves in an unfamiliar stretch of these great mountains, as we passed an actual dwarven hold, still inhabited by its keepers! Considering Dookanson's mustering, and how many warbands had come to his banners, it is only reasonable to prepare for them to make efforts to reclaim the rails and other holds. Furthermore, orcs still dwell in these caves and ancient rails, meaning we will have a fight for our survival, one way or another."
 H87_idea_2:0 "Demanding Supplies"
 H87_idea_2_desc:0 "Money doesn't grow on trees, and anyone who says otherwise is insane or trying to con their fellow goblin. Still, finding the necessary supplies for any large undertaking is difficult in the Serpentspine, be it from military campaigns to construction projects. So, we must acquire money and supplies from wherever we can - and if we have to ste- requisition supplies from our people as needed, then that is a simple, yet unavoidable misfortune. Goblins after all love to collect things, whether it was earned or not. What's wrong with collecting them back?"
 H87_idea_3:0 "Collection Administration"
 H87_idea_3_desc:0 "Collecting things from our people was easy, at first. Now, however, fewer and fewer goblins are paying their fair share to the Clan as a whole, and by extension the Clanboss. This has led to the creation of a special group of goblins, who- with the Clanboss' permission, are to go out and ensure everyone is paying their fair share, by any means necessary."
 H87_idea_4:0 "Clanboss' Cut"
 H87_idea_4_desc:0 "The effort of attempting to collect from our clan grows more and more difficult with each passing year, as goblins find clever rules or rather clever ways to hide their wealth from the Clanboss. The obvious solution is to simply take a percentage of any exchange or trade. This will allow us to move on from simply strong-arming goblins for big lump sums of wealth infrequently, to a much easier to budget stream of income."
 H87_idea_5:0 "Armament Effort"
 H87_idea_5_desc:0 "As the process of our collection grows, there have been many who would want to take from us our wealth and our land. Be it dwarf, orc, or even our fellow goblin, we must be ready to spend some of our wealth in order to defend it. By arranging for certain weapon producers to be given less extensive collection by our special agents, this will allow us to build a better understanding with those who are willing to supply our military forces. As well, it is not like part of the wealth we give away won't end up coming back to ourselves… "
 H87_idea_6:0 "Collection Breaks"
 H87_idea_6_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to centralize our wealth around the Clanboss and his ever growing organization, even as it grows so large as to require meetings on how to allocate the collection for needs of state, we have to rely on the powerful and influential who are outside the Clanboss' organization. By offering lessened collection and allowing them to keep more of their wealth, we can make them indebted to us in other ways, ensuring that we can make up for lost revenue from the rest of the Clan. "
 H87_idea_7:0 "Regulation of the Collection"
 H87_idea_7_desc:0 "Taxes. As we come into contact with other societies beyond the Serpentspine, primarily those in Bulwar and by extension our kin who continued to flee during the Exodus, we have learned other societies call our method of collection 'Taxes.'' While it matters little what we call it, at the end of the day it seems nobody likes paying up for the good of the state. Taking some inspiration from our kin in Bulwar however, has given the Clanboss an idea. By formalizing the rules of Collection into a series of codes, laws, and formal dates of payment, we can keep our subjects less disgruntled and reduce rock-thrown complaints through the Clanboss' windows- and at the Clanboss in general."

As the clan moves forward, so too has this tradition. Many goblins spend their spare time perfecting new insults for both rivals and friends. Now their insult skills are not only used to taunt the enemy into their demise, but have also become a tool of diplomacy and negotiation."

 H89_idea_2_desc:0 "Before the Greentide breached through Khugdihr and spilled into Escann, the goblin slave Rurnor Snotfinger led a group of fellow goblin slaves into the nearby caverns, avoiding the fate of those who would become the Common Goblins. Every goblin of Snotfinger knows this story well, and knows the truth of why there can never be peace with orcs. They all must die.\n\nOf course, there are many others who share our hatred of the orcs, and we may find ourselves with strange allies along the way. "
 H89_idea_3:0 "Free Goblins All"
 H89_idea_3_desc:0 "The Snotfinger clan came into existence through our escape from orcish slavery, and none of us have any intention of returning to it.

 H89_idea_4:0 "Snotfinger University"
 H89_idea_4_desc:0 "Within the depths of Snotslair lies a great complex of goblin learning known as Snotfinger University, founded in 1476 AA and named after Rurnor Snotfinger. Established by the goblins of the Snotfinger Clan as a school of engineering, in time it would become a city on its own merits. The purpose would end up being to both educate the next generation of expert goblin weapon-makers and engineers, as well as keep them and their experiments safely away from where they might blow up something actually important."
 H89_idea_5:0 "Chainbreaker Wars"
 H89_idea_5_desc:0 "Even during the Greentide, the Serpentspine was far from emptied of orcs. Dookanson would send plenty of warbands back into the mountains to rally orcish warriors and capture goblin slaves. This would lead to the Chainbreaker Wars, where the Snotfinger Clan would ambush orcish slavers making their way to Escann and liberate fellow goblins. Some would join with the Snotfinger Clan, bolstering the clan's numbers and further ensuring that the clan could withstand further struggles."
 H89_idea_6:0 "Trade Through The Dwarovar"
 H89_idea_6_desc:0 "With the end of the Greentide, the reclamation of Escann and dwarves returning to the Dwarovar led to a time of great difficulty for Clan Snotfinger. In time, however, trade with the surface would be established. Unlike the hidebound and traditional dwarves, Goblins have far fewer scruples in both business partners and methods of acquisition. Goblins, unlike dwarves, are far more capable in extracting the wealth hidden away in the tunnels and caverns of the Serpentspine. With markets in Escann reopening, it is only natural for us to take our fair share, especially with those unfairly turned away by the dwarves for petty things like “Murder” or “Smuggling”. Of course, taking a little bit extra off the top to finance wars and other endeavors is just the price of doing solid, reputable business in the Dwarovar"

After making it, Slobald quickly, and fatally, discovered the lethal side effects of continued consumption of his invention.\n\nThankfully his daughter and lab assistant Qihx was able to save the recipe, while also reducing the dosage per cup.

Many clans struggled against dwarves and orcs, but none other had to endure the pain we had been subjected to. As slaves to a black orc warband we were the lowest of the low, we were worth less than the dirt we slept on. But deep in our hearts there stirred a thought. A faint memory of hope that someday we could be free once more. This hope nurtured us, strengthened our resolve. It is only through these decades of hidden resistance that we could eventually gain our freedom from the orcs."
 H84_idea_2:0 "Empty Halls"
 H84_idea_2_desc:0 "The rise of Dookanson meant that almost all orc warbands had left the Serpentspine, leaving behind a gigantic power vacuum that is slowly being filled by the innumerous goblins crawling out of the eternal shadow. If we want to stay relevant in this world we must make haste and fill these empty halls with our own goblin kin who serve us and only us."
 H84_idea_3:0 "Cutthroat Expertise"
 H84_idea_3_desc:0 "To survive in the harsh world of the Serpentspine the Clanboss needs only the most capable advisors around him. But in a world forged by fearsome strife and bloody battles such as the Serpentspine a simple academic is useless if they can’t fight. To prove that an advisor can survive the world they need to fight for their place. Whoever wishes to lead must defeat the one in front of him. This way only the truly strong will be the ones to advise the Clanboss on matters of state."
 H84_idea_4:0 "Mithril Coinage"

To ease the burden we have supplemented their pay with coins not made of gold but of mithril, which we have in relative abundance thanks to our home, the mithril hold of Mithradhûm. This mithril coinage enables us to put our gold to other use."
 H84_idea_5:0 "Reuse Refuse"
 H84_idea_5_desc:0 "Left in the wake of the fall of Aul-Dwarov many holds and roads are full of ancient dwarven mechanisms and machinery of war. Those that have not been trashed by roaming black orc warbands can still be put to some use. Especially the old cannons and firearms are useful once they are outfitted and repaired with what we can find elsewhere. These patchwork weapons are quite hefty and to our delight we have found that they leave more than a few scars and blue spots."
 H84_idea_6:0 "Innovative Mining"
 H84_idea_6_desc:0 "While drills and pickaxes are perfectly suitable tools to scratch the rock of the Serpentspine they are not much use if we want to dig down fast. For that we need to blast away all of the useless rock by firing explosives from our mithril-cannons and free the precious, shiny metals, obliterating the surrounding stone in much the same way as we did to our warband when we gained freedom. These new mining practices will show the world what it truly means to dig a mine."

We were not prepared for the onslaught wrought upon us however, as the forces of Bianfang broke our lines and ravaged our city, our people despaired.\n\nHow had we fallen so? Was it our own hubris, or had we lost the favor of the High Gods? For years our people pondered and wept, but now we have finally regained our independence from those brutes.

 Y29_hulong_incendiary_scrolls_desc:0 "While Jilin isn't known for academics, the monks of Jilin are renowned for a particularly notable treatise, the Hulong Incendiary Scrolls. These scrolls were revolutionary for combat in the Xianjie, being manuals on experimentations with martial arts and items used for combat. Some of the items were explosive remote bombs, fireworks, early prototypes of land mines, and paper bombs, and the scrolls discussed ways of fusing these inventions with martial technique to create a new style of combat. These scrolls eventually helped pave the way for the common sight of monks wielding firearms, especially as new invaders from east and west threatened the independence of the region."

 Y29_neza_literacy_reforms_desc:0 "Neza 'the Generous' was one of the most notable righteous masters of the Jilin who, instead of focusing on the nation's military sector like his predecessors, gave careful scrutiny to the state's internal affairs. The low literacy rate and lack of education access had been problems neglected by the country for decades, and so he directed funds into educational reforms, public libraries, and improving schools for the populace. Neza is remembered in the Xianjie as an enlightened master not on the basis of physical strength, but on his heroic deeds in the name of justice."

Sirtan quickly found a place as an effective and in-demand middle-man, whose merchants sell many of these exotic goods from the rainforest while demanding none of the hassle or frustrating. By the Age of Witch-King, serving as such an intermediary for Busilari trade fleets and other Cannorian ventures would become a massive component of Sirtan's trade and economy."

Our enemies cannot react to our swift strikes, letting us cut them down in droves. This speed also allows us to strike in unorthodox places, confusing our opponents and bypassing their defenses.\n\nThe reason we are the only nation to use this tactic is because it demands a special beverage that is made only in our temples, enhancing our warriors' endurance and agility and allowing for their extreme speed.

Ealar returned to his people and showed them the truth in the seas, and where he first set off on his raft Murdkather was built.

Unfortunately, Jaerel's stance was only seen as a failure to choose a side, which saw many of his allies abandon him.\n\nTimes have changed, however, and as the world is led by the scions of Anbennar, a realm created to bring peace and equality, perhaps Haless is now ready to see that All Are Equals Beneath the Rising Sun."

Found and translated by scholars in the 19th century from a lost part of Jaerel's will, the Rezan Zimhar was a plan to essentially federalize the disparate and diverse cultures and religions of Haless into a united state which granted them great amounts of autonomy and privileges, all under an impartial sun elven central court. Assumed to be greatly inspired by events surrounding the collapse of Jaerel's empire-building efforts, he had hoped to present this proposal at Sarisung shortly before he was assassinated.\n\nNow that the Sunrise Empire shines ones again, perhaps Jaerel's ambition can now be realized."

Before that, most magic-users in Haless either utilized chi (their spiritual energy) or were outcasts studying rough forms of arcane, druidic, or other magics in the fringes of Halessi society.\n\nThe Monks of the Weaving Palm were a collection of sun elven magi, high philosophers and righteous path monks who apparently spent a hundred days and nights debating on the nature of spirits and magic in the High Temple of Tianlou.\n\nThere, they developed a concept of magic that was described as 'the weave', something that one must connect with on a spiritual basis to master, not just through study. While the concept of 'the weave' never reached wide-spread popularity, the Monks of the Weaving Palm proved incredibly deadly in battle, evoking arcane spells through movements and gestures akin to chi and cultivation practices, using nothing but their internal energies - the arcane 'weave' in the air - rather than spell reagents and components."

 Y00_we_all_lift_together_desc:0 "A common saying within the Sunrise Empire, possibly originating from ancient Yan proverbs, "We All Lift Together" was a slogan used during the industrialization initiatives of the Age of Artificery when many factories, funded by artificers and magnates, were created across Haless. It is said that the unity of the Sunrise Empire saw that every man, woman and child, regardless of race, had a role in lifting up the empire - or in a factory's case, worked as one in an assembly line."

The great lord Hiderion ruled over his human subjects not as a tyrant but as their righteous guardian, a true servant of the people and a paragon of the ideals set by Jaerel.\n\nFor the elves of Haless to thrive in this land, they must do so as equals of those that have called this land home for millenia, united in harmony under an serene empire, built on the virtues Hiderion lived by. We must not rule Haless as conquerors, nor as her "saviors". We must rule as her guardians, protectors of the peace and sentinels against those that would seek to exploit her."

The hill on which it stands is lined with ancient, crumbling stones rumored to stretch back to the depths of time, to fortifications that stood well before even the Castanite Exodus.\n\nThe latest fortress on the site was built following the establishment of the modern state of the Brinkmarches during the Aldresian Crusade, but even it remains influenced by our unique regional style.

Silvelar's renown has been further bolstered by silver's - and, by extension, its - association with the Dame. More prosaically, the silver that Silvelar exports in such great quantities has ever been minted into currency, and has circulated far and wide across Cannor. Yet one might say that its silver is blood-streaked, for Silvelar's silver funded the Damerian Republic's wars and paid for vast numbers of mercenaries."

Over the centuries, the nobility waned and the burghers waxed, and things came to a head. The city was victorious, and when Anbennar was established in 1221, Silvelar acceded to it as a Free City, answerable only to the Emperor, the yoke of its old aristocrats lifted from its shoulders."

Formerly a colloquial term used to refer to a member of the Silver Families with a particularly bad reputation, the Tarnished eventually became associated with the guild that Lucian Silmuna founded and would later be used to refer to the entirety of the Silvelari underground, which was - by that point - dominated entirely by the Tarnished and their subordinates."

However, with the death of the first Harpy Queen Firanya, her bickering daughters established their own flocks, splitting the once unified Queendom into petty squabbling.\n\nSince then, many have tried to reestablish the once great realm but it was the flock of Ayara that has unified us for the final time against the now weakened Kingdom of Birzartanšes.

Giving his life in the process, his actions were not forgotten, with many former Hašr refugees commemorating his memory and calling themselves the people of Erlian, the Erlian-natu, in his honour.\n\nWhen the upper Suran was finally liberated, plenty of those Erlian-natu were the first to resettle these lands and Azka-Sur has always been able to count on their villages to send conscripts for its wars."

No, the Azka-Suri knew their place was as the shield of the faithful, to be brandished by the heirs of Jaher in order to protect Bulwar from the Darkness in the Salahad and beyond. After defeating the gnollish hordes and bringing the Light of Surael to the depths of the desert, the ruler of Azka-Sur was proclaimed ‘Sur Zama' -Sun Shield- by the sun elven priests of Bulwar."

Their main inspiration following their wars in the Salahad was the Desert Legion who, while heretics, were also direct heirs to the legions of Jaher, praised be his name.\n\nWhile never as disciplined or skilful as the Legionaries they fought – and how could they be, when the legions were comprised of the Chosen who have centuries to master their arts and have the blood of Surael running in their veins – the Surani legionaries were nonetheless a deadly and feared force in all Bulwar."

They discovered that he was a half-elf, the only one ever known to walk the fields of Kumarkand.

Adorning it, the artifact began to glow faintly, and immediately his magical items fell useless to his side.

There, under the Imperial campaign tent, Erelessa, head of the Legion, presented a boy called Jaddar as the rightful heir to the Jaherian bloodline. His claim to succession was rejected by most leaders present, and he and most of the Legionaries went East into the Salahad. Meanwhile, Taelarios of Irrliam took the lead in splitting the Empire among the various Elves who all rose from governors to Kings.\n\nWhile the peace it created did not endure, with two more Cinder Wars in the 13th century, the Kalib partition made the city of Kalib famous, and paved the way for a diplomatic tradition the Kalibi are renowned for throughout Bulwar."

 R58_silk_capital_of_the_raj_desc:0 "Sardiphadin means silk, and silk means Sardiphadin. This common saying in the region has been true for roughly as long as the city itself, which grew out of an encampment where multiple silk-weavers joined together their businesses. Since those early days it has flourished, even despite the various warlords of Rahen and the theft of their secrets. In the renewed Harimraj, it has become a rival to Dhenijansar itself in its magnificence, due to its nigh-monopoly on the realm's silk supply.\n\nRedglades silk might be cheaper, Bulwari silk more plentiful. But no one in Halann has a material as fine, embroidery as elegant, or colours as radiant as Sardiphadin silk. (Or at least, so they would have you believe.)"

 R58_thieves_from_the_west_desc:0 "For most in Halann, the event that divides history into a before and an after is the Day of Ashen Skies. But for Sardiphadin, a different nigh-apocalypse happened five centuries prior, when in 503 BA visiting Zanbari merchants snuck into a silk facility and absconded with a few silkworms, along with the secrets of silk production. Sardiphadin's greatest secret was out, and would never be recaptured.\n\nEven centuries after, the scars still go deep: from a reflexive distrust of foreigners, to the rumored secret police that patrol the city and keep its dealings well-hidden."

 R58_the_temple_of_towers_desc:0 "Rendered in great detail on Sardiphadin's flag, the Temple of Towers was the brainchild of a particularly wealthy silk merchant with a passion for architecture. A lavish complex composed of numerous soaring spires, silk ribbons blowing atop each, it has been the city's distinctive landmark ever since its construction. Still, for most, it is largely associated with Harimar the Great.\n\nDuring his rapid conquests after unifying the harimari living in the Jungles of Ascension, Sardiphadin was one of the first major cities to bow to his rule. It is said that, upon receiving their surrender, Harimar climbed to the Temple of Towers' highest point. There, he proclaimed that all he saw would soon bow before him — and he was right."

 R58_direct_cannorian_trade_desc:0 "In the 1800s, following the opening of the Jashar Canal in Jasiir Jadid, Cannorian traders flooded into Rahen. This gave Sardiphadin the opportunity to market their silks directly to these wealthy buyers, rather than having to rely on Bulwari merchants to transport them. This served two purposes: they could avoid working with those untrustworthy thieves, and also maximize their own profits. Soon, Sardiphadin silks could be seen as far away as Anbenncóst or even in Marlliande's most lavish estates."
 R58_silken_slave_soldiers:0 "Silken Slave Soldiers"
 R58_silken_slave_soldiers_desc:0 "For almost as long as Sardiphadin has been rich, the question of how to protect those riches has loomed. For roughly as long, most of its ruling class have chosen the same answer: rely on the ever-loyal slave soldiers of Bhuvauri. They already know the secrets of silk-production, so there are no costs to letting them into Sardiphadin's inner-most sanctums, and they are sworn to protect their charge with their lives. At its peak, the Harimraj banned such practices, treating the Bhuvauri more as foe than friend, but as the ministries grew corrupt Sardiphadin was quick to take advantage. A number of companies have been on direct retainer from Bhuvauri for decades now, and these contracts are the bedrock of Sardiphadin's defenses.\n\nSome thought to reconsider this arrangement after the "Typhoon of Broken Vases" in 1699 AA, when the Bhuvauri were bribed by Lorent with vast sums of money and exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their employers in the Porcelain Cities (recompense for the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage). But their voices were far and few between, and the next regiment that rotated onto Sardiphadin's walls was adorned in porcelain jewellery."
 R58_weaving_new_flags:0 "Weaving New Flags"
 R58_weaving_new_flags_desc:0 "The 16th century saw a number of new powers rise in Rahen. From the sprawling Jadd Empire forged out of the nomadic Jaddari, to the unification of many Ghankedhen families in Rahen's west, to the resurgent harimari state of Vanrahar, never-before-seen states arose into major power players. And each, of course, needed a new flag to symbolize their new status.\n\nSardiphadin was always quick to leap at this opportunity. One of the first envoys each new monarch would receive was a silk-merchant from Sardiphadin, bearing a rendition of the new banner in finest silk. This gift would pay great dividends — Sardiphadin could expect an order for more renditions within a year, and it always ingratiated these rising powers to the City of Silk."

 R58_the_edict_of_sardiphadin_desc:0 "One of the many reforms that Manava, Harimar's grandson, passed was the Edict of Sardiphadin. It established the new system of castes in Rahen. While it was received with mixed enthusiasm throughout the wider region, in the south it was readily integrated into legislation and many of the native Raheni took everything decreed by their benevolent harimari overlords as gospel." # This is a current South Raheni idea.

When a Cannorian merchant or Yansheni scholar thinks of the sub-continent, they think of a lavish jungle or an opulent city, not of an arid, scorching, desert. The Tudhina, however, embrace the desert.\n\nMany shepherds include the desert as part of their wandering, and they believe their flocks are made hearty by its sand and heat. But most notable is the coming-of-age ritual every male and female Tudhinai goes through at age sixteen: they must spend three days alone in the desert, with only a single waterskin and a loincloth. A few of every generation perish, but for the most part, each emerges newly forged by the desert heat — and knowing it like an old friend."

Others find themselves most at home in bustling city (especially in their most lavish of palaces). But a few harimari reject both, finding the humidity bad for their fur, and the chaos of city-life overwhelming to their keen senses.\n\nSuch harimari often find their way to Tudhina, which has for centuries embraced them in turn. The arid heat, the pastoral lifestyle, the fiercely loyal people — these may seem anathema to most harimari, but for a handful, it is perfect."

His keen eyes could count the number of spears arrayed against him, his ears could hear the war-horns blow from leagues away. But when he came to Tudhina, it was his nose that proved most salient.\n\nFor rather than resisting Harimar, the Tudhinai welcomed him with a great feast, slaughtering their finest cattle and arranging a massive banquet to welcome the great conqueror. Ever since, the Tudhinai have continued this tradition, inviting the Raj once a decade to indulge in a feast of harimari proportions. Their hospitality has long won Tudhina an out-sized voice in the Lotus Court, well exceeding their nominal status as a minor prabhi."

The more perceptive might appreciate the value of cowhide for leather, opportunities in the alchemy that uses brain or heart. But only a true Tudhinai appreciates one of the most important outputs of their animals: excrement.\n\nThe dung is a powerful fertilizer, turning the arid land at least somewhat arable, and by the 17th century, it was even being exported to Rahen's burgeoning cotton and indigo fields. It is also the Tudhinai's traditional fuel source, a clean flame perfect for roasting meat over, and burning strong against the night's chill."

And among the many forces rallied against the hobgoblins, one of the most distinctive was a single brigade of Tudhinai, who had crossed the Marutha to join the war effort for unclear reasons. They brought with them two particular things of import: a vast amount of beef jerky which they stubbornly refused to share with their brothers-in-arms, and a surprisingly fierce fighting spirit."

 R42_a_shadow_on_the_sun_desc:0 "In the late 15th century, following early conquests in Bulwar, Jaddar and his people set their sights on Rahen. From winning over the allegiance of many Ghankedheni, to divvying up the coast with the Bhuvauri, to trampling resistance underneath their desert steeds' fearsome hooves, few could stand before them. But although they were not heavy-handed in their rule, and sought to win over the populace with lavish festivals and generous policies, the Tudhinai chafed nonetheless.\n\nRooted in the Unbroken Claw school's long-standing grudge with the Radiant Sun, the shepherds were often late in their taxes, only paid lip service to Jadd rituals, and nigh-refused to join its legions. When the Deioderan came, tearing the Jadd Empire apart, they were some of the first to rebel against the East Jadd Empire — and the Nahana Jadd would never reconquer them."

Over the course of only a few decades, with the help of dwarven engineers and a few Cannorian artificers, pastures and farmland were largely replaced by factory and foundry. But a few families in the region found the smoke-filled skies of West Rahen to be anathema to the skies they knew, the skies they had lived under for generations. These outcast Ghankedheni often found a new home just east, in Tudhina, where they could continue their pastoral way of life among a new people, and forge new families together with them."

Only the Light of Surakel remained to save its people from damnation and corruption but the old priests still adored the dead gods and refused to acknowledge that the only salvation could come from the Sun. But in 1150 BA, an hermit emerged from the Salahad desert and gathered followers. He spoke of his visions, of the war between the Gods, the Darkness and the sacrifice Surakel made for his people and his never-ending fight. The old city of Vacyn welcomed Hammura the Wise who became the first kašra (priest) of Surakel and built the first temple, eduz, to his glory, giving a new name to the city.\n\nBulwar may have become the centre of the cult thanks to its huge population, but every true believer knows that the Cult was born in Eduz-Vacyn."

Eventually their rule declined as gnolls invaded the upper Suran, but they never were conquered by foreigners as the petty kingdoms of Avamezan or Azka-Sur always guaranteed their independence for the sake of the faith.

With this title, he claimed primacy over the various temples of the Sun Cult as the first religious authority of the believers.

Then priests light up incense, the smoke purifying the believers who pray for Surakel to rise up in the sky. Then the light of the Sun pierces through the smoke to illuminate and bless its chosen people.\n\nAs Eduz-Vacyn is the main producer of incense in Bulwar and the temple has a monopoly on its production and trade, the local souk is always filled with merchants sent by the various followers of the Cult."

But they were soon shown the errors of their ways when His Legion defeated the Surani Alliance, that had been assembled by the priests of Eduz-Vacyn. The Savior of the World, praised be he, entered their temple in 1025 and banished their fears of retaliation as he left the temple and the city intact after praying atop the temple all night until the rising of the Sun.\n\nFollowing their mistakes, the priests of Eduz-Vacyn became the staunchest supporters of the Jaherian Cult and developed an inquisition to track down the unbelievers that formed the basis for the later Jaherian Exemplars."

Even Keladora I Birzartantazuir was said to have consulted Azkabari in designing her formidable bureaucracy, and they would play a key role in the administration of the Jadd Empire (and their arguments with Harimari ex-ministers over proper paperwork would become things of legend)."

The corridors that separate the cells are not patrolled by humans or even elves… but by ominous spectral creatures, with an almost blank face dominated by a gigantic mouth that devours the hopes and dreams of its victims.

Their work in education greatly helped the poor locals, as they set up schools and hospitals in various places. Along with their aid they brought a new faith and a new single god. Their Ravelian teachings did not spread far into Bulwar, but they certainly took hold on the Drolas, who saw their god as the one that lightened the hardships that they had gone through under Surakel."

They drove back the gnolls, and the Anzabadi were among the first freed by these newcomer saviors. In their liberation, they reclaimed the phrase, and so the chained sun militia was formed.

Anzabad has never forgotten, nor forgiven, them for this crime.\n\nAt its best, this rivalry pushes every Anzabadi merchant to perform to the utmost, knowing any deal around the Divenhal which does not dock at our ports may very well dock at theirs. At its worst, such as in the brief chaotic period following the death of Taelarios Irrliazuir, it has lead to the sugar-marshes of the peninsula being watered with human blood, and full-scale privateering efforts crippling trade in the eastern Divenhal."

But in 1501 AA, with Gnollakaz having seized Kheterata in the south, and the encroaching Jaddari to the east, Akal Baraz szel-Aban began a project to build up the old ruins to their former glory.

And so Harklum for centuries has given them a place in the army, the 'Childrens' Corps', so that they can find their purpose renewed and their light set ablaze. While this was traditionally constrained to Harklumi children, in the late 11th century an enterprising Akal sponsored orphanages across Bulwar, to ensure no child's light is dimmed for long."

And this belief is only reinforced by the Sunlily berry, one of the more interesting and curious plants native to the region.\n\nWhen consumed, the berry grants a man the energy to go through an entire day, requiring no other food and only a small libation of water. No doubt this is a small emanation of Surael himself, all his life-giving energies condensed into one small ounce of creation. It is what ensures we can tend our fields with care, despite our dispersed population and strife-rife lands."

When Barseen took control of the place, it was little more than a pile of ruins. His son Bavar I, with his Akalate flourishing, ordered the restoration of the old fortress and turned it into a palace.

But they tended to charge exorbitant rates — all knew of the gold mines at Azka-Evran's heart — and also were quick to flee when a battle turned south.

And then gold was discovered in the region, it became one of the most important fortresses in all Bahar, and had its garrison increased ten-fold.

He found the forces beyond the walls a stark contrast to those manning them: disorganized, lackadaisical, sloppy. He rose quickly in the ranks, imposing the guards' discipline on a small regiment of his own. The regiment's subsequent success during the conquest of Re'uyel and the war with Birzartanšes proved his methods, and when rose to lead Azka-Evran, he instituted them across the army.

Setting up targets further and further away, they compete and hone one another.\n\nDeggarion was particularly keen on this game, and at the head of his own regiment, ensured every soldier learned a sniper's accuracy.

But after the Burned Empress's death, amidst the chaos of Jexisian civil war, they made a decision as poor as that prior one had been wise: siding with Elizar, whose sole focus was on revenge against Ioriel, they were abandoned when Birzartanšes struck in a war of subjugation. As a final indignity, King Birzartan I put his brother Eletar on the throne of Baharšes, now renamed Baharkand.\n\nThey would not regain their freedom for a full generation, when they fought a brutal independence war, watering the forests and hills with blood as they used guerrilla tactics to secure their freedom.

Eighard mobilized against this threat in time to defeat the invaders, and joined with Einnsag's coalition to defeat Raithtall to stop their meddling.

Thinking the Eordan savages who would be easy to dispatch with their advanced weaponry, the Guild fleet fell into a carefully prepared trap. When their sailors were loading the ammunition into the guns, the Einnsagger druids summoned a storm that drenched the enemy. No ordinary storm, the rain still contained the brine of the sea, not just a nuisance but corroding the gears and making their weaponry unsafe to fire.

The folly of Dorcurt was the assumption that no large forces could arrive from the Domandrod because of the restrictions on entry enforced by the Gladewardens and fey spirits within. The Tuathak Legion guards were quickly overwhelmed, unprepared to fight such a large force so quickly, and almost all those gathered at the conclave were murdered by the balance-obsessed zealots. The Sonad of Raithtall, Urian Oakgardner fought to avenge his comrades, but was pierced with a poisoned blade.

At first viewed as a troublesome but unimportant heretical cult by the mainstream Autumn Court who favor the aspect of Autumn as the season of harvest and preparation, the Cult of Rot seized control of Eighard overtime, slowly replacing the governorship until even their Esbagg adhered to their practices.\n\nTheir most infamous practice was the construction of a new prison in Darblath, a squat but deep building extending far into the earth, where heretics and prisoners were locked in pit-like cells and left until their body decayed into soil. The many bones left behind were showcased as a warning to would-be troublemakers, with some thrown into a massive pile outside the prison as example, and others left in a long corridor all over the floor and walls where domestic and foreign dignitaries were reminded of their fate should they fail."

Home to only scattered tribes of Snecboth unable to fight off Ewandil's army, the Tuathak forged a new realm named after the natural harbor shaped like a spear thrust into the Randrunnse.\n\nFortune struck Slegcal, for in their southern reaches bordering the Egasach brilliantly shining gemstones were found peaking through the barren soil.

The secret alloy used by the bladesmiths resembles the bronze used throughout Eordand but for its curious iridescence, owing to the rare and glittering black rocks near the compound.

Armonadhi tools and artifacts have been found in the hinterlands by wandering miners, but Snecboth history tells of how the Armonadhi met their end. The Snecboth, while recognizing that all seasons are not equal but unwise in trusting the cold death of Winter, migrated to Galbhan and Armonadh. The ancient Armonadhi fought back against the Snecboth, but could not handle face the superior magic and equipment preserved from our Domandrod heritage.'\n\n'As the reader should be aware of already, Slegcal was founded by Tuathak Hibernal Crusaders after the ambush at Minnorac shattered the Crusade's leadership. Our founder, Ewandil Firstborn recognized the promise of this land and that the clergy of Eighard would have no say over our new realm. Ewandil pacified the unruly Snecboth by instituting a fair taxation system: those that do not recognize the superiority of Autumn over all else may be permitted to live in peace in exchange for an increased tithe.

However, its beauty did not impress the ever-fickle Fey, who were instead threatened by its ability to injure draconic and fey creatures. The fey demanded that it be destroyed; the Gladewarden who forged the sword refused and fled with it beyond the Armonadh mountains, never to return.\n\nCenturies later, Darran Eaglesthorn set Slegcal on a mad quest to retrieve Dracball. Contact with the peoples of the Ynnic river valley spread tales of Dracball, supposedly having slain a mighty dragon at war with the Rzentur centuries ago! Raising his host in the far north near the Broken Sea in 1782, Darran Eaglesthorn marched into Dragon Dominion lands towards Arganjuzorn, intent on retrieving the legendary sword. While the Rzentans proved to be untrustworthy vassals, breaking their oaths near instantly, the people of Arganjuzorn recognized their status as subjects to Slegcal. Agreements were made with the Dragon Dominion to allow Slegcaler movement along the upper Ynn, and the first Eordan embassy was established in Svemel.\n\nAt last victorious, Darran drew Dracball from its hilt and spent nearly a month testing it against the monsters of the Epednar plains, including slaying a mighty Poskawa Whale, a gigantic mountain-like fish monster that blends into the rockfields. When news of Cannorian mercenaries invading Slegcal reached Darran, he returned home to face off these invaders but was already too late. Darran Eaglesthorn met his end speared with bayonet during the defense of Eirminn, clutching the bloodied legendary blade beyond death until his fingers were cut off by a looter. It is said that the Juzornic lords assembled their retinues alongside Darran, hoping that Slegcal may prove an invaluable ally against both Ynnic and Cannorians.

However, they began to talk of unity to defeat the Winter Court in their holy war, a case far too dangerous to ignore. The Eordellon faithful agreed and assembled an army to quell their unity, and were granted passage through the Domandrod by the Fey Lords for enforcing the balance.\n\nGathered in their seditious conclave, the leaders of the Autumn Court were an easy target to eliminate, for Dorcurt lies not far from the Domandrod's obscuring borders.

Despite their obsession with trivial matters, the Arakepruni had amassed great knowledge, population, and the wealth to use them. To combat this threat the Iadthi allied with a useful Spring heretic: Manaron Goldtree of Elchos, vassal of Arakeprun. Goldtree sought to liberate his possessions from the clutching grasp of the Arakepruni scholar-clergy, and garnered support from across Arakeprun's nobility to stage an armed rebellion.\n\nPelomar, always imagining themselves the great hero of old, took this as the prime opportunity to weaken their rival, while Iadth allied with the upstart Elchosi for purely practical matters of resolving our volatile border with Arakeprun. The border territory of Tasmet had long been disputed between Dorcurt and Arakeprun, but Iadth had no use for the Autumnal heretics that dwelt there.

The brothers, seeking an opportunity of a lifetime, asked to build a center of artificery led by them. The dragon, who usually masqueraded in ruinborn form, seeing the practical use of artificery and perhaps kinship with his misbegotten cousins, granted their wish.

By the time it did, this composite army was already too big to not give it support without risking having their holding sacked for “standing in the way of the Dragon's will". Some of those lords gave the army supplies and safe passage through their lands, while others joined the totality of their force to them.\n\nThis army, despite being massive, was heavily infantry based, as well as plagued by organisation issues.

For the goblins, they had always been a selfish lot. In their dark undergrowth of the Serpentspine they crawled over each other and killed each other for scraps, living truly to a "every goblin for themselves" mentality.\n\nUs kobolds, however, had to survive, but we did that together. We lived closely with our people and learned to share in our resources and tribulations, so it was no surprise that when we came to Haraf that the gnomes and goblins went their usual way in their treatment of the ruinborn - seeing them as lessers or a thing to get rid of. But we welcomed them with open arms, and in time they proved themselves as great members of our society, and many, like the famous warriors of the Kalun Masks, served in our armies with pride."

Rocks replaced with shrapnel bombs, tripwires replaced with laser sensors, and pressure plates made into land mines. As Gommoport and Mestikardu spread with impunity, claiming large swathes of Haraf for themselves, both understood well enough that for the benefit of their soldiers and explorers that they should steer well clear from Zurzumexian lands."

A great achievement enabled by this technology Zurzumexia's "Scion District", filled to the brim with structures sitting high above the rest of the city without any walkways, as the inhabitants of these high sections fly between buildings like the dragon scions of old."

For Mestikardu, this resulted several very powerful families holding power in the city, and together they formed an agreement to put the stability of the city, and their families, above all."

Once Mestikardu was established it moved its primary offices from Bayvic to Mestikardu and got into the business of funding other Aelantir expeditions.\n\nTheir competition, the dwarven Asra Bank, had standards and preferred expeditions that would succeed. On the other hand, Sizapzarko would lend to anybody, particularly those with a shortsighted desire to get rich adventuring. Either they succeed and the incredibly high rates mean Sizapzarko makes a huge profit, or they fail and become basically owned by debt.

Lithe and dextrous, with the strength afforded to the rough life in the jungle, these ruinborn voltoj found a place amongst the elite guards of the city, and with their ability to traverse the jungles (due to their height), they eventually found themselves as the principal commanders of the Kardun armies."

He lost a paw in a duel to the soon-to-be Emperor, however, and his wound festered until he died in 21 AA.\n\nHis son, Vamayur, was more talented with pen and parchment than sword and shield, and came to Harimar's attention just as he was beginning to be faced with the challenges of governance. Vamayur was instrumental in drafting the Harimraj's first set of laws and ordinances, many of which are still in force today. It was for this service that his dynasty earned the lands of Pasiragha, and furthermore, through intricate loopholes and clever designs he ensured it a place of prominence in the court beyond its seeming stature.\n\nVamayur compiled his lessons and wisdom into a tome, Vamayur's Codex, which was passed down from generation to generation, and from senapti to senapti during the latter Harimraj. Though said to be secret, over the centuries a few copies were made — finding their way into a certain estate's bookshelves in Sramaya, and a constant guide to the young Senapti Mahapalar of the Flower Oath — and once the printing press arrived in Rahen, it was disseminated far and wide.

Though originally restricted to High Philosophy scholars, by the time that Jadd missionaries were coming east, it had opened its doors to any one with an idea worth discussing. Even amidst the turmoil of 16th and 17th century Rahen, the palace only grew and thrived: it was where the Nahana Jadd defined its tenets, became a hub for Raheni artificery, and by the early 19th century one could find scholars from as far afield as Konwell and Aqatbar joining its lively debates."

Philosophers and comics alike turned to political cartoons as a way of expressing their thoughts on contemporary affairs. These quickly became a staple of the Raheni political scene, and by the early 1700s, a pamphlet printed in Pasiragha could be found inspiring debate and discussion in Srayen or Sarisung within days of its creation."

Within it, the porcelain workers felt safe to revel in their riches. But everything changed when Harimar attacked.\n\nThough the walls were insurmountable, the gates were not. The harimari troops quickly breached the city's mighty gates, and quickly overran its defences. But Harimar was a benevolent conqueror, and he saw the value of a kind example in bringing the rest of the Porcelain Cities under his paw. Instead of sacking the city, he allowed its rulers to proclaim him sovereign. Then, before he left, he ensured the shattered gates would be rebuilt out of pure porcelain, a shining white beacon so that all would remember how quickly he had seized the city — and his mercy afterward.\n\nThe days of the old Harimraj are long gone now, but the White Gate still stands, the symbol of Khiraspid and harder than any wood or stone. And though hobgoblins threaten from the north, zealots threaten from the east, Khiraspid's White Gate will stand strong, nigh-insurmountable, against them."

Not a single individual, no matter their fitness or position, is allowed to shun this duty, and it ensures that Khiraspid never goes without a well-manned guard.\n\nThe other Porcelain Cities often looked down on this practice, which meant an apprentice porcelain-worker would share a spear with a street urchin, especially when mercenary forces and Bhuvauri slave soldiers were well-trained, plentiful, and cheap. But it would pay off in 1699 AA, when following the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage, Lorent paid the Bhuvauri a vast sum and promised them exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their would-be masters and sack the city of Keyattordha. That city was left ravaged, and the slave soldiers also looted a few others as they abandoned the Porcelain Guilds' contracts in full. After the "Typhoon of Broken Vases", as the event became known, Khiraspid alone stood untouched."

Alas, all good things must come to an end.\n\nIn 1507 Tluukt's old enemies, the Jaddari, declared the final war against the gnolls in Bulwar. While some traitorous gnolls sided with the elves and accepted the Jadd, the loyal gnolls of Tluukt fought to the last soldier, but despite their ferocity were pushed back all the way into the recently restored Ekluzagnu. Here, the Jaddari led an extremely long and costly siege, fighting floor by floor to kill every single gnoll in the fortress. Ironically, the very same place destroyed by Xhazobine ended up being the site of last stand of gnollish rule in Bulwar."

Varbuk was one of these half-orcs, having been born in Dalaire to an orcish mother and a human master.\n\nIn 1597 after witnessing his master brutally kill his mother, Varbuk managed to break free and killed his master along with his entire family, liberating orcish and half-orcish slaves. Calling themselves 'Varbuk's Freemen', they moved around Dalaire freeing other slaves and causing havoc on the colonists. The revolt was seeing plenty of success until the colonial armies managed to secure few key victories and pushing former slaves deeper into Dalaire.\n\nHaving nowhere else to go, Varbuk led his men into the Cursed Forest. Colonial armies chose to let them go, believing they would perish against the Cursed Ones. However, that was not the case.\n\nAfter several years of traversing the forest and fighting off the locals, Freemen have emerged on the other side.

Outraged by that act, Varbuk declared that half-orcs can't rely on anyone but themselves and must build their own future.\n\nThis policy has persisted long after Varbuk's death.

Fortunately, Freemarches wasn't the only country with desire to tame the forest.\n\nGnomes from the Broken Sea faced the same problem of Cursed Ones' raids and resistance. To combat them, they invented the Bond Breaker - a small metallic rod that operates at the same frequency as Kinbond, distracting and confusing the affected Cursed Ones for a short period of time. The rod however could work only at a short distance. In order to properly test and utilise this new invention gnomes needed to get close enough to the Cursed Ones.\n\nNot willing to waste their own lives for this, the artificers contacted Freemarches with an offer. They would employ some half-orcs and have them venture into the forest alongside gnomish expeditions to act as a protection against the Cursed Ones, and in return gnomes would provide some Bond Breakers for Freemarcher use. Half-orcs accepted gnomish offer, and this dual endeavor greatly decreased half-orcish losses against their old enemies."

When goblins first invaded this region during the Exodus they made no attempts to learn any of these foreign languages. As they began transitioning from roaming hordes to proper states and interacting with the locals more frequently the problems of communication became clear as day. Initially, Overclan's government proposed the creation of a new language by combining all those present in Bahar, but it was deemed an unnecessary waste of time and effort.\n\nThe actual solution was the employment of non-goblins who taught goblin administrators, diplomats and rulers in those local languages, while encouraging all others to follow suite.

Very few were willing to work for these former invaders, especially in the bureaucracy, as that meant having a near constant contact with goblins. An intriguing solution was proposed by Overboss Dramkork in 1529 - raising orphans as bureaucrats. Many locals have lost their families during the Decades of Devastation, Goblin Exodus and during the Samartal investigations and were left with nothing, fighting for scraps on the streets. Overclan provided those children with shelter and food, in hopes the children would work for them.\n\nThe program was a success, with the Overclan raising a proper bureaucratic force within just a decade, which was fully utilised in the subsequent Bahari-wide programs.\n\nA large portion of said orphans was made of Voltoj - half-goblins, who were not always orphans, but castaways from their families.

Those were mostly made of indebted peasants and soldiers, both of which were disillusioned with Elven rule and hostile to the invading goblins, who plagued the countryside and occasionally even raided the larger cities.\n\nAfter goblins have secured their rule in Bahar, many of human adventurers turned to banditry as well. Those former adventurers did not recognise Overclan and saw goblins as mere monsters, harassing any goblin controlled cities and punishing non-goblins for what they saw as supporting the enemy.\n\nThe issue was resolved only following the formation of Overclan. Scouring of the bandits became the first truly united effort in the Overclan, with goblin, human and even some elven veterans working together to end this issue. The proposed solution was the creation of a volunteer militia, which was trained in combined goblin-human-elven tactics and spread throughout the region. The volunteers consisted primarily of those directly affected by the bandits.\n\nWhile Overclan's main armies were focused on securing the integrity of this newfound nation, the militia secured its internal stability by fighting the bandits, while also trying to convince adventurers to stop the raids. The bandit plague met its final end in 1547, when the volunteer militia cleared out the occupied citadel of Azka-szel-Azka, which has been used by bandits as a safe haven.

In order to do that however goblins needed to atone for the damage caused by their Exodus. That was done with a 37 year long process known as the Decades of Restoration.\n\nWhile primarily Decades of Restoration focused on restoring razed buildings, rejuvenating old farms and resettling abandoned villages, its primary function was to convince other races of Bahar to accept goblin rule. The first few goals were achieved relatively easily, but the racial integration saw heavy resistance. The solution came in a form of Voltoj.\n\nFollowing the creation of a new bureaucracy made out of orphans, half-goblins became an integral part of the Overclan administration and actively participated in the Decades of Restoration. Local Bahari preferred working with more humane looking Voltoj than goblins. Seeing this, the Overclan decided to nearly entirely transfer the integration part of the program to the half-goblins. As expected, half-goblins made considerably better effort in securing good relations with other races, further increasing their standing within the Overclan as they were seen as a thematic representation of Overclan's racial syncretism."

Before the unification of Bahar however, goblin navies were the weakest in the Divenhal, having been sunk by human, elven and dwarven navies on numerous occasions. Once the Overclan formed and integrated other races' designs into their own, the goblin fleet became a common sight in the Divenhal.\n\nDuring the early 1600s, a goblin writer Zyt the Short wrote a history of the goblinkind, in which he claims that goblins have previously conquered two frontiers - the caves of the Serpentspine and the forests of Escann - and that now Exodus Goblins have begun the conquest of the ocean, also known as the Third Frontier. Unsurprisingly, this thought became popular in the Overclan, partially as a reaction to recent successes of Bayvek and Mestikardu, two other seafaring goblin nations.

The religion and conversion to it were heavily promoted by the government. Yet Ravelianism only became popular with goblins, with nearly all remaining shamanists having chosen to convert and adopt Ravelian teachings and encouraging Cannorian artificers to move to Bahar.

But Amarien saw an opportunity in this devastation: she decided to recruit many of the elves that could not fight in the Legions, or who had already fought but had gotten injured (and left without a manor tended by humans to retire to), to immigrate to her lands. There they toiled the fields, rebuilt whole villages and cities and sponsored a strong elven culture in the hills and mountains\n\nNowadays, nowhere in Bulwar one finds so many sun elves as in Birzartanšes.

Called Ordalanner in honor of his creator, the cannon was so massive it needed 50 oxen to be moved. This great weapon was instrumental in the siege of the great Dartaxerdim fortress of Kuzak in 1484, its fire shattering the walls in a way only the most powerful of archmages could match.\n\nThe country's early interest was only furthered as artillery progressed over the years, and as the safety of operating a cannon increased, the need for human or dwarven engineers was soon replaced by Sun Elves, who became experts in operating the machinery and the black powder.

They would do so by passing an examination that was the same for everybody, everywhere in the kingdom.\n\nThe new class of bureaucrats was still predominantly elven and from the old aristocracy, for only they could spend entire years studying for the examinations, but the testing process allowed the state to remove the corrupt and unsuitable administrators that had plagued it."

To ensure that this problem grew no further, the Jaherian Exemplars in Birzartanšes were tasked to apply the ‘Cleanliness of Blood' Edict, or in Sun Elven 'Silsun Sirad', which required every person applying to serve the state to demonstrate a pure ancestry in either human or elven blood.\n\nThe role of these Exemplars expanded over the years as they began to examine human villages and quarters for individuals who looked "too elven". By the late 1500s, their power was so great that they could even dare to publicly target a prince of the royal family. Taelar, grandson of Arantir and minor prince of the royal family, was caught in an affair with the palace singer and dancer Emmita Nuartu, and got her pregnant.

Prominent figures gather for a soirée during which they wear elaborate masks, drink the finest Jaherian Sunlight, and dance to the sound of famous bands from all over Bulwar.

The answers of the Sun Elves to the malaise that plagued Bulwar in the 15th century were diverse: Some turned towards magic, others sought guidance in the Sun Cult's faith, many sought to reinforce the supremacy of the elves; all to enforce their position as the true Phoenix Successor.\n\nBut in Birzartanšes, Keladora saw nothing but mere illusions in the endeavors of her neighbours. What would allow the Phoenix to rekindle its flames? It would be creating the perfect state, and putting the needs of the state above all else.\n\nShe was the one to craft the now famous ‘Kuil szel-Laded' (‘State Reason') philosophy, the idea that immoral actions could be justified if the state required it. No alliance, no scheme is impure for the ruler of Birzartanšes as long as it allows the state to protect its subjects."

Many Kheteratan advisors were allowed in the court and were considered some of Zaleria's closest allies, something unheard of in other Kingdoms. In addition to this, she tasked her priests with finding similarities between the worship of Surael and Elikhet, and many were found. Both gods are believed to be the only true god. Both Surael and Elikhet sacrificed themselves so that darkness could be held at bay. Both Surael and Elikhet had a Chosen people (The Elves and Khet respectively) which were appointed as guardians of their servants. Some high priests have claimed that Surael and Elikhet are one and the same, and Elikhet was a manifestation of Surael to protect against the Darkness in times of dire need.

One of the striking differences between Kuzarami and the rest of Bulwar is that the most important prayer of the day is not made at dawn but at the twilight, the Kuzarami praying for Kuza to regrow and help them fight the Darkness in their hearts. And every lunar month when the Moon disappears, the Kuzarami lighten their homes and the whole mountains and pray for two days for Kuza to reappear.

But the mountain clans were deeply loyal to the Amarienzuir dynasty, for it was Amarien of Imulušes that had burnt the last harpy nests in the mountains and freed the Kuzarami.

His poem ‘Utur-Irnitu' (Great Success) made the phrase famous throughout Bulwar as he boasted at how pathetic the Gelkari were in their endeavors compared to the mighty Kuzarami.\n\nMaking enemies everywhere he went, he was forced to travel throughout his life and decided one day to leave for Aelantir.

As the nomads deliberated what to do with the deposed god-king, one of the Djinn from the Salahad arrived in the city. She said to the chieftain that the only way to deal with Amussu was imprisoning him for all eternity, and that she was willing to lead a group of warriors to a place where they could build a prison and guard it.\n\nThe warriors doubted the sincerity of the Djinn, whose interest seemed to be to prevent the rise of new genie-binders. But they accepted the offer, and thus, Ardeth and his kin followed the Djinn to the most distant reaches of the Salahad, when they found an oasis in the depths of a basin surrounded by mountains. There, in the deepest section of the gorge, they build a prison for the god king. Neither Ardeth or their kin ever returned to the eastern plains or the banks of the Suran; they never witnessed the glory of Karqašlu or the darkness of the age of monsters. They stayed in the Nihruqalu, the Silent Hall. Standing guard. Protecting a land that they will never inhabit.\n\nBut at some point their numbers dwindled, and they had to interact with the Salahadesi nomads that would become the Mašnih. They showed to their leaders the unkillable evil that they watch over. The tribal leaders offered to send warriors to nurture the ranks of the szal-Ardeth, and since then, when needed, the wardens recruit both men and women from the other tribes.

While most of the former slaves fled south and formed the kingdom of Dasmazar, Yazkur and several warriors stayed and managed to occupy the Harra oasis for a decade, before being expelled by the gnolls.\n\nAnother great clan member was Ekrem szal-Yazkur, who lost an arm fighting Zokka, and during the Battle of Sun's Providence, tried to kill the Pack-Lord before Jaddar could.

Many were lost in the desert, and one by one died, until only Fazil and eight more remained. They would not have survived if not for their stumbling upon the lost city and its oasis. There they found the knowledge of Ancient Bulwar, and they decided to keep it safe until the Bulwari were free to practice magic in their own home. They adopted a silver nine point star as sigil, representing the nine original magi and the brightest star in the night sky, Fazil.\n\nThe szal-Fazil are renowned for their wisdom and use of magic, and their magi are usually found in other tribes as advisors.

Some fought hard (and earned a punishing occupation), while others gently acceded to the new conqueror, but none could stand before the desert's storm.\n\nMedurubar was one of the states that fought the fiercest, engaging in street-fighting block by block even after the Jaddari legions had pierced their walls. Even after conquest, legions of Lightbringers could not stamp out this rebellious spirit, and the city remained firmly (if quietly) defiant of the Jadd. The resistance largely consisted of late tax payments and underground dissension — that is, until Surael blessed their cause with a Jadd civil war.\n\nDuring the Deioderan, Medurubar led the revolt against their Jadd overlords and helped secure the independence for several western Bulwari city-states. As the threat of the Jadd was not eliminated, and the Jaddanzar Empire left behind was certain to seek reconquest after licking its wounds, these states united into a loose federation known as 'Surakeši League', with Medurubar being elected the league's first leader."

Next came Udiš szal-Šarad, a brilliant politician and commander who's sharp intellect allowed us to break free from Akalesian rule. Then most recently, and most upsetting, came Seyma szal-Radin.

Finally, those humans with magical talent were able to practice their craft openly, and our humble lands quickly became a home for those with magical capabilities.

While Varilor's long rule is remembered as a prosperous one, his longest-lasting legacy was in his treatment of humans who lived in eastern Damesear.\n\nWhen other Elfrealms maintained their elven purity - or intermingled to such an extent that they no longer were true Elfrealms - Varilor ensured that the Damerians were able to continue their separate existence under his lordship, leading to Varivar becoming unique among the Elfrealms of Cannor for retaining minority elven rule over a human majority. Interestingly, this led to Varivar becoming a haven for not only elves, but for all races, in spite of the apparent disproportionate rule."

The largest of these shipbuilders, the Bluewood Arsenal, became famous for producing some of the finest ships in the Dameshead, the vast majority of which went to supply Dameria's 'Wooden Wall'."

The fact that many of Varivar's elves had personally known Munas in life and held great respect for him also played a role, of course.\n\nFor almost five centuries, the Temple of Munas at Varivar remained the center of the Moonsinger's veneration, being eclipsed in importance by the Great Temple of Ibevar only after the temple's sacking by the Wexonards in the aftermath of Dameria's dismantlement. Even after Varivar's conversion to Ravelianism, Munas' worship continued on, with the 16th day of Esmarment being an annual holiday to mourn Munas' death and celebrate his life."

The Varivarians spearheaded a Silmunist movement among Dameria's former subjects that sought to restore Silmuna rule over Dameria's former lands. Wexonard attempts at curtailing the Silmunist movement through violence simply pushed the loyalists underground, giving rise to the Shadowmoon Conspiracy."

Since Eargate has traditionally served as the Damesear's first line of defence in the east, the fort of Eargate has throughout the years been upgraded to stay up to date with advancing technology and hosted a small order of battlemages that provided the fortifications with much-needed firepower prior to the age of gunpowder. However, as naval batteries grew more advanced, the seafort on the tiny island of Floodtower Pass grew more important, since it had the ability to intercept any vessel trying to cross the sea to Damesear.\n\nThese fortifications proved crucial during the Corinite Wars, where the water batteries and the battlemages of the seaforts stopped the Corinite League's navies' advance to Damesear, and would have posed a significant obstacle for Camir's invasion of Anbennar, were it not for the sabotage of the fortifications by the Shadowmoon Conspiracy."
 Z42_marines_of_varivar:0 "Marines of Varivar"
 Z42_marines_of_varivar_desc:0 "Varivar's dependence on the sea for its income and trade connections left it particularly vulnerable to raids by the various warlord states that emerged during the Interregnum. In response, Varilor's successor, Erondil Bluetongue, established a dedicated naval infantry company in 1207 to protect Damesear's coasts and merchant fleet from foreign incursions. First of its kind in the world, Varivar's Marín Company would go on to become the blueprint after which the other marine corps of Cannor were modeled, and even named after.\n\nIn the aftermath of Varivar's annexation, the unemployed marines entered the services of foreign fleets as naval officers and drill sergeants, or formed freelance mercenary companies, such as Laochri síl na Már or the Dameshead Marine Company. From the first landings of Lorentish forces in Noruin, to the Gnomish Hierarchy's invasion of Eordand, these 'free marines' would be vital to the success of countless amphibious assaults, and would eventually form the basis of Anbennar's Imperial Marine Corps."
 Z42_sustainable_development_act:0 "Sustainable Development Act"
 Z42_sustainable_development_act_desc:0 "As artificery gave rise to industrialisation, Varivar came to struggle with questions of the impacts on nature of industrialisation and urbanisation. On one hand, Varivarians valued their forests and did not want to see them being destroyed by these rampant developments. On the other hand, Varivar's earlier proto-industrialisation had made the region wealthy by Imperial standards, with windmills, shipbuilding, and clothmaking generating an export economy that rivaled those of much larger duchies.\n\nVarivar took a third path, spearheaded by economist and former forester Aveline síl Marionaire: sustainable development. Based on the forest management laws of 1654, which combated the overexploitation of forests for timber with mandatory forest replantings and logging regulations, Aveline proposed an economic policy organising Varivar's economy to ensure that living conditions and the economy's needs were met without undermining the stability of nature. Although the Sustainable Development Act was implemented only at a local level, it nonetheless led to Varivar being the sole voice of sustainable design in the Empire against the chorus of maximised industrialisation, and led to Varivar becoming the center of nature conservation and environmentalist movements in Cannor."

At the near end of this path are the so-called 'potentiates', people who have latent magical ability but lack the discipline to use it in any consistent and meaningful way. At the far end lies the Universal Mind, the great dispassionate, impersonal intellect which suffuses all the world. The Ascendant is the being who traverses this great path, growing in each stage until they achieve a true union with that purest Intellect.

In the Black Demesne, to suggest such regulations was not merely seen as foolish, but rather a blasphemous heresy against Doctrine itself.

Precisely because the most powerful positions were restricted to magic users, these same powerful people often chose to surround themselves with those who could not possibly be a threat. They often promoted members of the non-magical class based on pure competence, justifying the high placement on the basis of intellectual virtue. This was in stark contrast to many other kingdoms, where promotion was by right of blood alone."

Thus, the Demesne had great need for living scouts, battlefield engineers, and officers. Such positions were an excellent way for non-magical subjects to climb the social ladder by making themselves valuable to mages. Every time war was declared, a great influx of some of the Demesne's most intelligent, driven, and ambitious people came to serve the army in all manner of roles, a pattern that would later earn the moniker of 'the Reaper's Gift'."

In the Demesne, it was an expectation and personal obligation for every magical initiate to serve for at least some time in the military.

Theoretically, as long as one wore the ring of an Acolyte, one was honorbound to give nothing but absolute loyalty to the legitimate bearer of the Ninth ring in all matters.

Depending on the area of impact, this can have any number of effects - particularly skilled individuals can delay these blows up to eight hours, bringing a man down as he goes to rest after combat!\n\nWhen brought to combat, this is a particular asset to our warrior-monks; the fast and unpredictable nature of combat leaves few capable of reacting, let alone stopping, to a blow that can incapacitate them as quickly as it was struck. As any could expect, this maneuver is an asset in melee combat."

 Y47_the_righteous_band_of_108_desc:0 "As far as nations are concerned, ours is a history especially humble. Before Yizeikwu came to be, the region was nothing but a humble group of villages, controlled by the distant Jinhusi. Their aloof system of government had few problems, until the day arrived when they demanded extortionate sums of money from the villages as part of a Xianjie tournament's financing. In effect, these taxes were so extortionate that every villager would need to sell everything they owned in order to even hope to pay them off.\n\nIn response, a delegation of villagers made their way to a bandit group, the Society of the Gentle Fist, and promised them power for their salvation. When Jinhusi came to collect their dues, their armies were turned aside by the power of a martial art never before seen. It was from this that Yizeikwu was born, and the story of these legends and their mythical (to outsiders) fighting shall serve to instill awe in our nation."

To this end, Gentle Fist monks prove some of the most effective as both guards and robbers. Through its swift incapacitation, the Gentle Fist is able to dispatch any enemies with ease, such that a robber's success is determined by their stealth and ability to carry.\n\nMany warrior-monks use these heists as an opportunity to train their skills, and one consequence of this is that many know all the usual spots that valuables will be hidden."

To enforce this, all of these bandits performed a delayed blow upon another of their number, such that they might die once they broke their oath.\n\nThis tradition carries on even today. Whenever an individual is inducted into an office of sufficient status, a warrior-monk performs the Secret Art of the Gentle Fist, a move that delays an individual's death until the monk decides it should happen, only for their head to spectacularly explode afterwards. Not many abuse the office."

Many of the village militias in Yizeikwu have tested this tactic extensively, encouraging deep bonds between soldiers such that they will fight harder for their friends. It is effective - as proven by the occasion when a contingent of militiamen held their ground against a hobgoblin attack until they proved victorious. Were they not brothers, they would have been rooted long before."

This is only half true; though our soldiers eat as much as any other, a bountiful store of food is carried alongside all armies, and it itself is consumed as quickly as the regular stores. The reality is that we provide a veritable feast to our soldiers on the evenings before battle, often consuming as much as quadruple the regular stores in a single night.\n\nThough it is helpful to raise the men's spirits, this practice also grants us the appearance of being gluttonous - which, though seemingly harmful, has its own benefits. It is particularly humiliating to be beaten by a man you think is a mindless glutton, and because of that our triumphs seem so much more than they really are."

An angry man dies just as easily as a happy man, in truth, but none remember this in the moment.\n\nThis has been carefully cultivated by our warrior-monks for centuries. Each man is a master at verbal combat, with tongues as lethal as palms. None can make a man as angry as quickly as a Yizeikwu monk. With their expertise we will be able to determine the perfect spots with which to deliver an agonizing tongue-lash."

Their unique mastery of shadow magic makes practitioners of the School of the Looming Shadow masterful fighters and infiltrators, able to mask their presence, muffle their footfalls, and even step instantaneously between distant shadows. Fabled figures such as White Blade An Lai and the goddess Nathalyne are said to have learned these and other exceptional skills under the watchful eye of the masters of the Looming Shadow, and their great renown has made the myth of the school grow even greater. Such powers and legend make the monks of Yantrakari respected and feared among the powerful of Haless, for it is a rare day when one marked for death by the Yantrakari escapes alive. After all, where can you run when every shadow might hide a lethal blade?"

The coming of Jaher and his Phoenix Legions displaced hundreds of thousands of people across Haless, and many of those that fled the lowlands of Rahen and Bomdan would make their way into the misty hills of Xianjie, where they were given shelter by the monks of Wulin. Some of these refugees began to serve the Wulin directly as a show of gratitude for being given a new home. Put to work on less-than-honorable tasks that the masters did not want to be associated with, the early Yantrakari performed with great enthusiasm and zeal as they began to serve their new home. To this day, the Yantrakari families are bound by a strong sense of unity and loyalty to the concept of the Xia as a whole, an oddity among their normally fractious countrymen."

The Phoenix Empire in Haless was deeply unstable for its entire history, and both Jaher and his son Jaerel would be assassinated by Halessi intent on throwing off the Elven Yoke. It was the Yantrakari who slew Jaerel and broke the Phoenix Empire in Haless forever, one of their greatest agents infiltrating the palace of the Sunrise Emperor and slipping past all of his defenders to strike the killing blow. The prestige of that kill, the final extinguishing of the Phoenix's embers, is to this day the greatest glory of the Yantrakari."

Though their loyalty to the Wulin is beyond question, it is rare for more than a token delegation to attend major festivals or gatherings of the Schools, and it is not unusual for the Yantrakari to completely ignore official summons of the Masters. The day-to-day lives of the Yantrakari reveal this secrecy and inward focus to be more than just diplomatic show - folk do not converse as they pass on the street, nor do they hold open markets for the sale of goods or gather publicly for religious worship. Though they are open with those few who prove themselves trustworthy, the Yantrakari's inherent stoicism and reticence to engage with outsiders makes them nearly immune to spies or saboteurs seeking to steal the secrets of the Looming Shadow."

Crafted on looms made of ebonwood, creation of a Shade Cloak involves the weaving of fine silk and threads of shadow together into a product not quite corporeal. Seeming to ever shift as if buffeted by an unseen wind and blending perfectly with its background, those who wear these Shade Cloaks are rendered nearly invisible in dim light. With this tool enhancing their already lethal arsenal of skills, the assassins of Yantrakari are nigh uncatchable when vanishing into the night."

A deeper examination, however, would reveal that Yantrakari towns are anything but ordinary, and running between the various buildings of each community are extensive networks of hidden chambers, false walls, tunnels, and subterranean rooms. These secret living complexes allow individuals to hide themselves away in the presence of intruders, or move swiftly from one side of a town to another for purposes of defending their communities. The great experience that the Yantrakari have developed with labyrinthine building has not only made their homes difficult to conquer, but also made them into experts on creating the most usable space in the smallest area with the least resources."

Among these are a variety called the Qi-Xin, beings of fog that take the form of winged snakes and eat the idle thoughts of daydreamers. The monks of Yantrakari have learned to summon the duplicitous and cunning Qi-Xin, and with pacts and deals have been able to glean great knowledge of the past and present. Some believe that the Yantrakari learned the secrets of Shadow Magic itself from the Qi-Xin - but whatever the truth behind the legend, there is no doubt that the Yantrakari spirit callers are masterful at gathering secrets from across Haless and using them against any targets or enemies of the School of the Looming Shadow."

It protects us from harm, allowing a handful of brave Kuta to protect the rest from harm. It also provides a year-long source of food, providing a plentiful bounty of fish, big and small, for the Kuta to graze upon without concern for harvests or rains. It does this without complaint, and without payment - for most.\n\nWe hold a yearly festival where many fruits and vegetables are thrown into the ocean, a payment in nourishment for all that it does for us, followed by games and festivities where the ocean might watch and be entertained.

There were very few places for constructing powerful ships meant for the open seas, and fewer still to maintain them - the resources were simply needed for other affairs. This all changed when a group of Yanshen pirates sailed to our shores, captained by a pirate queen. Following a friendly reception and a few hours of examinations, they offered a deal: they would pay for the construction of port infrastructure, provided they were given preferential treatment.\n\nThe docks that followed were grand and efficient, providing room for even the greatest ships to come to port and rest. Many new techniques were pioneered in the creation of the first Kuta dock, many of which are still used today to great effect."

Only by joining with another individual and raising a third can someone show that they have set the desires of childhood behind in exchange for the nature of the real world.

Though the tolls are slightly higher than most, the sheer openness of the docks makes up for it. All individuals, provided that they follow Kuta's laws on dry land, are allowed to do as they please upon their ships. There have been cases of pirates saving their own lives by sailing into Kuta, where their presence was not only embraced, but protected by the local forces.\n\nAs a result, ideas tend to flow in and out of Kuta more openly than any other place, for our extraordinary openness makes our port a far more tempting haunt for merchants; though the sea elves come to buy goods, oftentimes they often also sell new information to be investigated and processed."

It is still up to the sailors of Kuta to fight well enough to turn aside any army. As it so happens, they are capable of just that.\n\nKuta sailors are braver than any other on Halann, and fiercer too. Many a raider ship has been defeated after being outmaneuvered by a Kuta ship, who moved in to board and battle when their opponents would least expect it. Many soldiers first distinguish themselves on the ocean, and nearly all leave with their aptitude at sea unharmed."

They were small, and were designed to be easy to bring to port and depart - for their environment was one with poor ports. They were made to transport individuals and to survey the Ringlet Isles, and were designed with exceptional speed in mind - to evade fights, rather than perform them.\n\nEventually, due to sustained naval combat, these djongs found new purpose. The djongs would be tied to larger, heavier ships, then detached as combat was joined. They were able to maneuver around larger ships and, using the exceptional bravery of Kuta sailors, boarded and neutralized enemy ships-of-the-line."

Increased Cannorian presence in Haless resulted in an even greater influx of information and goods, the most notable of which were missionaries. These Ravelian missionaries eventually found their mark and, slowly, converted the populace to Ravelianism. In the year 1788, a single year after efforts began, the nation of Kuta was the first in Haless to officially proclaim its state religion Ravelianism. A period of openness followed after, where the country gradually permitted more and more business opportunities, including the first organized logging companies for the Lupulan Rainforest.\n\nIt was said that Kuta was the main factor in the spread of Ravelianism, for their native missionaries were more capable of adapting the faith to the unique conditions of Haless."

Her reforms refilled the Brenulan coffers, filled the army with men, and replaced the old administration with a system so efficient we use it even today.\n\nHer genius is the reason we are an independent country today - having defeated Arawkelin without even a single arrow fired - and her reforms, visible even today, are doubtlessly why we are still independent from our old overlords today."

Gasps of fear, unreasonable anger, even inhuman hunger; all of these can be removed by ritual or by elixir. As it happens, many of our country's problems are caused by spirits.

The music of Jaya Raya is remarkable for its fast tempo and strong percussion, and the addition of metallic sounds creates a melody that is incredibly popular, not to mention loud.\n\nAny who fight us will hear the echoes of Hebat music, an omnipresent beat that our troops might march, fight, and die to."

Though the arrival of Pinghoi complicated matters, the struggle with foreigners is one that Jaya Raya is very used to.\n\nThough they might seem superior, none know the Lupulan.

It performed the water dance I have heard so much about, and eventually they animated a second, and the two did all sorts of things, all the while their puppeteers (were those really puppets?) narrated their goings-on. It felt almost as if the dolls were waiting for cues.\n\nIt did not look like any kind of necromancy to me, and that unsettles me. These puppets... there is nothing like them, not in the whole world.

Yet circumstance cannot be sunk, and her pride and joy was destroyed but a night before a battle with a great host from Feiten, a storm ridding her of every boat save for a single piece of driftwood. Facing death, she called upon the ancestors of all in Kudet Kai to deliver her. They listened. A fleet triple the size of her own came to her aid, and a crew of apparitions and ghosts ushered her to captaincy. With their help, she routed the fleet and saved both Kudet Kai and her own life.\n\nAll of the captains of our nation hold this tale to be true, and all await the moment where they must plead to their ancestors for aid. It shall come when they truly need it, and not a moment further, and for this they fight harder than any other. None wish to plead their case, only to discover their misery is no fault but their own."

As ordered by king Tarakar in the year 1702 AA(many sellswords used the Cannorian calendar, and so it was easier to use it as well) a marvelous building was constructed to hold the Danon Dungcam guild, a sort-of-adventurers-guild used to organize mercenary companies for all to make use of. The most promising individuals were hand-picked and hired for highly competitive wages, recruited into the regular forces of Kudet Kai."

They rarely interact with outsiders, so much so that the only opportunity to truly see one is during a diplomatic outing. Their appearances are often breathtaking, for a skin as white as porcelain combined with intricate, beautiful clothing combines to create some of the most attractive people in Haless.\n\nFew can resist the charms of a Tlagapatung diplomat, for their unearthly perfection is hard to look beyond. Likewise, the reclusive nature of this people makes it exceedingly easy to identify outsiders who do not belong."

Capable of manipulating the earth and shaping it into various forms, they are also capable of reading the subtle signs of a land that knows all - a sort of divination. The pastel tones of their dyes are used to divine the future, with various colors representing different circumstances. For example, an individual's love might be determined by burying pink dye and uttering the individual's name. The earth shall provide an answer - sometimes clear, sometimes not. This divination is a powerful tool, for it allows the geomancers of Tlagapatung to read the future, and in doing so determine the best routes for the country to take."

Subjugated for many years, the geomancers of the land were conscripted for use elsewhere, put to matters of divination and war. It was a dark time for the kingdom.\n\nThat is, until a chief named Caksak Sajan made a fateful discovery. Having found an abandoned statue under the lake, the chieftain signed a dark covenant; they promised the statue followers in exchange for the freedom of his people. Using this power, Tlagapatung was able to break free of the Jaya Raya yoke. Ever since, the whistling people have enshrined the lake. The spirit beneath was powerful indeed, said to be one of the first Great Spirits to roam Halann, and the people of Tlagapatung think highly of it for delivering them their freedom."

These rights draw from the Tlagapatung belief that all deceased individuals are tied to the land upon which they perished, and so guaranteeing families land to reside upon allows for their ancestors to stay united and strong.\n\nWhat this means for the state is that it owns far less land than what official records indicate. Many malignant beings lurk within the Lupulan rainforest, and every family parcel is one plot less that the state must guard..."

The section of the Lupulan that the nation resides in is particularly infested with spirits (both malicious and benevolent) and is rife with their influence. For this, the efficient operation of the council is a necessity.\n\nIn exchange for their duties, this council has managed to carve itself out a very needed niche in the government, and the pawangs hold great influence in the government, unlike lesser spirit hunters."

Floods hit record highs, earthquakes shook the jungle, and hostile spirits swarmed like angry hornets. To say the state had fallen upon hard times was an understatement! In 1627, to round off all these events, the Pinghoi pirates invaded Tlagapatung, seeking to subjugate their inhabitants. Though the soldiers of the whistling people fought bravely, their state was so shaken by disaster that it could not provide them with what they required for victory.\n\nThe king at this time, Kalagamet, led a band of soldiers to Semat Tidakhui, begging it once more to deliver its followers from destruction. What transpired none can say, but 7 days later the king returned with a band of Hantu, powerful spirits with demonic powers. These Hantu routed the Pinghoi pirates easily, emanating negative energy in waves so strong that those they faced often routed outright. How our patron spirit could summon a host of this magnitude is unknown, but by integrating the Hantu into our regular forces we can ensure Tlagapatung never faces destruction again."

All sorts were named, from minor animal spirits that could hardly be seen on a human's finger to the very spirit of the Lupulan, marking it as one of the most complete almanacs on spirits even to the modern day. These books were popularized in the 17th and 18th centuries as adventurers flocking to the region used them as guide-books.\n\nWhat they did not know is that the wizard writing these was a devout follower of Semat Tidakhui. Countless symbols and hymns to the spirit were disguised within the pages, such that any uninformed individual would be instilled with an unhealthy amount of respect for the spirit of Tlagapatung. The consequences of such trickery is not known, but some rumors have attested to a gradual increase in demonic energy at Tlagapatung's sacred shrine."

One of the most important of these principles is to live in harmony with the spirits of Haless, enabling good while stopping evil. To simply label them all as malicious or benevolent is a harmful designation, and so our people have had to learn the nature of each spirit they encounter.

In order to resolve this issue, we have had to find new combat uses for copper.

In times of peace, however, we used our extraordinary mobility to settle disputes. Many horsemen were talented negotiators, and even when negotiation failed, our riders were able to force a solution.\n\nThe soldiers of the Baihon Xinh, though plentiful, were not able to fully cover every area of the empire. We, however, could. For this, we found a lot of purpose even at peace. The memories of this conflict resolution stay with us even today, and none are our equal at resolving conflict."

The last emperor, known posthumously as the Driven Emperor, overheard his sons plotting to shatter his hard-won empire into squabbling statelets. Though he might have loved his children, the mere idea of this disunity was more than he could handle. Mad with rage, he prepared their deaths - yet found he loved them too much to kill them by his own hands. For this deed, he hired an executioner - his first mistake - to kill them all. He failed, and one of the slayers-of-unity fled north, where he prepared the destruction of Baihon Xinh.\n\nUnderstanding the nature of his failure, the Driven Emperor used a lost Khom ritual and killed himself to live as a specter, seeking to dedicate his very existence to saving the empire he so beloved. Even with a forbidden ritual, his efforts fell upon deaf ears as the hated separatists tore his empire apart. It matters not, now, for the Driven Emperor still wanders Halann, rended from his corporeal form, and his presence fills us with the very same stuff he exists from.\n\nVengeance.

For many agonizing weeks, they drew their noose ever tighter around Hon Sai, and it seemed that even the final stand of the empire would prove insufficient. Thanks to some well-placed money and connections, however, a Binhrung army and Sirtani raiders arrived and defended Hon Sai from an immediate invasion from Ma Hoang.\n\nNo debt went unpaid that day.

This convenience is appreciated by merchants, who prefer to take the route through to the realms of Thidinkai and the Lupulan rainforest.\n\nBy creating and maintaining trade stations across the river, we can make sure any merchants wishing to take advantage of the river will need to first pay their dues to us as they go about their way.

The Khom people have kept this system rigid, going so far as to formalize it.\n\nAn individual lives and dies according to their familial role.

Though many had the courage to stay when the traitor pretender broke away, this courage turned out to be nothing but a ruse. As the Driven Emperor killed himself as part of his immortalization, many took it as their sign to leave. Countless nobles, big and small, fled to Ma Hoang, throwing their lot in with him.\n\nThose few who remained, whatever the reason, quickly found out that they had made the correct decision.

His sons lie dead, their bones ground to powder and forgotten; his restoration of Baihon Xinh has brought it to peaks never before known. With this done, he left this mortal world as gracefully as he entered it.\n\nBy this point the Driven Emperor was beloved by all Khom people, and countless plays and works of literature based on the stories of his life.

Of course, this came with a benefit - we would protect those who paid us tribute. Few tried, and fewer succeeded in their invasions.\n\nOne came closer than most. The elf Jaher marched upon Haless, seeking to subjugate it to elven rule. Though he nearly succeeded in subjugating Baihon Xinh, 300 defenders held a fortress for over six months, which allowed the rest of the Thidinkai to rally to their defense.

This fascination culminated in the Ethereal Makkbom, a large tower which was one of Halcann's earliest formalized observatories.\n\nMany observations of constellations and stars in Haless can be traced to the findings of the observatory, who carefully logged every discovery and pattern.

For the Silcalas themselves, the CLSTC serves not only as a source of revenue, but also a platform for opportunity outside of the constraints of the Cannorian feudal system.\n\nIndeed, when the Blackpowder Rebellions swept the continent, many Silcalas were happy to relinquish their titles in Arbaran and elsewhere, for their wealth came not from their feudal estates but from their interests in the CLSTC."

Under orders of Director Laurens Silcalas, in 1602 the various ship-borne detachments were organised into the Calasanni Corps of Marines, and soon proved themselves an effective fighting force, most notably against a Lorentish force at the Battle of Neuros, even if still looked down upon by the knights of home."

The sort of ship that could survive the journey across Uelos' Lament was not always the sort that the Company needed, and as its operations grew it soon began building its own. To ensure consistency and a sufficient supply as conflicts against competitors and pirates intensified, in 1633 Director Alfons Silcalas ordered the construction of a set of shipyards in New Calas, and in time the Company's intra-Aelantir sealanes were dominated by fleets of standardised ships built there, known as merchantmen, following patterns drawn up by experts hired from headquarters in Damescrown.\n\nBut not only were these merchantmen used for trade and cargo - they were also armed to protect against pirates or privateers when not sailing in convoy, and though not built to stand against proper warships, they were at times pressed into service to bolster the Company’s navy, and on more than one occasion the additional numbers turned the tide of battle, such as at the Battle of Cape Mordun."

Had the Company remained solely in Cannor, the wars of religion would have divided it, for their noble backers in Arbaran turned Corinite whilst their bourgeois headquarters in Damescrown remained staunchly Adeanic.\n\nBut in their Aelantir operations, such divisions were kept out of the open, for Ara was respected by both the Corinites and Adeanics of the CLSTC, and zealotry had always been ignored regardless in favour of prosperity. Even with the arrival of the Ravelians, religious divisions within the Company remained unimportant, for there was space for Saint Ara of the Ravelian Church in their beliefs too."

Despite supporting opposing sides, with Ebenmas favoring Vels Bacar and Arganjuzorn backing Arverynn, no shot was fired over the border, which allowed both of us to end the war mostly unscathed.

Known as dread slavers and merciless marauders, many chose to surrender and accept gnollish oppression rather than fight when Viakkoc's armies approached.\n\nThis experience in domination proved as applicable in newly-conquered Akan as it was in the south.

Longtime rivals, the armies of the two gnollish packs clashed before the walls of Kheterat for two days before Grizaka's superior magics crushed Viakkoc and his army against the shoulder of the Mother's Sorrow.\n\nThe Clash of the Gnolls at Kheterat was an unmitigated disaster for Viakkoc and led to the disintegration of its wider empire. Viakkoc XI, grandson of the dead king, led his people home in the aftermath of the battle and vowed revenge on Grizaka and all her followers.

They dreamed of a Gnollish Kingdom at the heart of Dameria, a Gnollish Emperor on the Dove throne directing a terrible empire, one that would spread the Xhazobkult across the Divenhal and Dameshead. Though they would never achieve this goal, the Corsair Fleet made four great raids on Damesear between 1643 and 1731 in an attempt to gain a beachhead for this new Empire of Viakkoc, burning the forests of Varivar and seizing many treasures from the temples of the Moonmount in the process."

A truly distinct national identity had been forged."

Putting the tribesmen to work clearing vines and shrubbery, Harimar found the beautifully sculpted walls of a High Temple.

As the patriarch of the Caoban family, Sang saw his word as law regarding his sons, expecting them to perform whatever he demanded of them exactly as he demanded it.

So, when he came to find out that they had gone against his wishes and planned to partition the empire after his death, he felt (and maybe was) justified to order their execution.\n\nWe will reform these laws and customs.

The monks argued well that a particular mural held a far more martial connotation than previously believed. The philosophers took this revelation to heart, believing that the methods of chi cultivation the monks practiced gave new insight into the High Gods, and begged to be taught how to perform it. The monks relented, and a new tradition was born.\n\nThis new class came to be known as the Righteous Philosophers, adherents of the High Philosophy but trained in the Righteous Path.

Even after losing its empire, the spirit raged on, tormenting the people of Tuan Caoban in their dreams and sending familiars to abduct innocents from the streets for use in nefarious rituals. It took the efforts of the new emperor and a host of spirit hunters to finally put an end to it.\n\nChanged by the events he experienced within that palace, the emperor worked with what lucky few survived the ordeal to establish the Order of Banishment, a governmental body that would train and deploy spirit hunters to put down any spirit that threatened the status quo.

The untimely collapse of the Hierarchy would see their numbers bolstered even further by waves of gnomish upper class refugees who flocked to the shelter provided by their close ally. As a whole, these Delta Gnomes who once comprised the upper echelon of classical gnomish society still maintain many of the traditions and customs of the Old Hierarchy that have otherwise been forgotten by their Cannorian brethren.

The marshy floodplains that surround the river's delta feel this great love the fiercest, yet Koroshesh has endured and even continued to expand and grow into the moist swampland. The key to this success lay in the ingenuity of the Delta Gnomes, who have cultivated their namesake with precision and care, constructing levees and dams throughout the delta. Dried drainage canals line the city, stretchmarks that serve as testament to the countless acres reclaimed from the wetlands and repurposed for urban development.

The ascension of Khetarch Amsiskhet III, however, saw a resurgence in the influence of the Delta Gnomes when he elected to fill his court with gnomish advisors, directing them in particular down the burgeoning field of artificery.\n\nThe magnum opus of this brief period of artifice in Kheterata would no doubt be the Mechamel - an ingenious if somewhat uncanny automaton that could only charitably be said to resemble a camel. Ambling about on dexterous, extendable legs of metal and comfortably capable of seating two, the Mechamel promised to revolutionize the otherwise labor intensive lives of the Kheteratan peasant.

These faceted gems with 56 cuts would become a trademark of the Delta Gnomes, yet to produce a gemstone of such obscene refinement was a painstakingly slow process that required a lapidarist with a lifetime's experience. Consequently, these powerful weapons soon became an artifact of classical antiquity wielded only by arcanists of both extreme skill and wealth.\n\nWith the advent of artificery, however, the degree of scientific precision that a Gnomish Cut gemstone could provide led to an explosion in their demand.

What drew both of these groups and more to settling in the region is both the reason for the River's distinctive color and it's main utility: Sulfur. As a result of the volcanic activity of Mount Havoral in the Day of Ashen Skies, Varainé became home to all sorts of volcanic chemicals - mostly sulfides - that besides giving the river its faint green-yellow coloring, also serves as the basis of several important Varainéy industries, such as the production of Fertilizers, Glassware, Gunpowder, Pharmaceuticals, Beauty products, and Alchemicals."

Utilising those Juzondezani that had stayed loyal to the Dominion, the Seekers were established, a secret police organisation focused on rooting out the disloyal elements found in Dolindha.

Small, wingless and almost like humanoid dragons, they claim to be related to - or even created by - dragons. They first began to arrive in the lands of the Rzentur en masse after hearing of Varlengeilt, the one true god. They venerated the idea of dragons as gods in Cannor, but none were to be found, until their arrival in Aelantir.\n\nExcellent excavators and with a predisposition for finding wealth, many of these kobolds devote themselves to Varlengeilt and gladly adopt the true faith.

A devoted group of veterans, returning from the War of the Great Dragon Host, founded the Order of Dolenmach which pursued the mission to safeguard Drozmagog's egg from any Ynnic incursion, hiding it for its safety among the foothills of the Ekyunimoy Mountains.\n\nThen, in the spring of 1443, the egg showed signs of life, eliciting great joy, but also eliciting great caution. The members of Dolenmach were priests and forward-thinkers, who realized that many would try to persuade the young hatchling and influence them negatively, or worse, try to subvert the Son of God to their own ends. And so the news were kept secret for a year, until the joy and commotion for His Divinity's hatching became too much to hide.\n\nAfterwards, Dolenmach kept fighting to ensure that Drozmagog's spawn was raised by morally upright guardians in a philosophically and culturally rich environment, overseeing the creation of the Ustajanky ik Drozma, or the Mouths of the Dragon, tasked with ensuring the Son of God would be capable of not only leading the faith but also of uniting it towards a new future."

The swamps and fens of Mocvare are shallow and filled with muck and rivergrass, making normal paddles ineffective. This resulted in the development of crude hand powered paddle boats.\n\nThis gnome, whose name was incomprehensible to our scholars, with local assistance, replaced the hand-crank with a chain powered by foot pedals, and attempted to “test” the device against the current of one of the Ynn's canals. Unfortunately, this is when we learned that gnomes are physically frail, and a “light current” to us, for them is apparently enough to pull them into the sluices that maintain the waterflow. Thankfully, since they expected to return, their notes were left on shore, and the advancements had some merit and left hands free to fish or, as has grown even more common, allowed people to leisurely travel along the River’s waters - so long as they keep away from the deeper parts!"

My hopes were dashed when I saw the local inhabitants: they looked at me like I was from another world, and ignored me when I pleaded for shelter. Each villager had a weapon in their home, and wouldn't hesitate to grab it and threaten me. Only the local priest, a Ruinborn named Vardha, was kind enough to offer me a loaf of bread and some shelter.

It would only be learned upon the arrival of the Cannorians- alongside a few bloody close encounters by inquisitive gnomes, that the blade is some variety of Precursor spellblade. While no one is any closer to slaying the Beast and claiming its treasure, its sightings are rare, and those who seek to confront it usually end up dead.

The Rzentur had been pushing into the Ynn for decades, striking against its faithful in an effort to spread the dominion of their dragon god. Mocvare was targeted due to three reasons. The first was simple practicality. Any further expansion into Dolindhan realms was blocked by Mocvare, whose knights were more accustomed to fighting in the treacherous swampland and would have been a consistent thorn in the side for any circumventing force. The second was logistics: the Great Dam was a large crossing that allowed armies to move easily to the north or south bank of the mighty Ynn. Finally, there was faith: Mocvare's Great Dam was an important holy site to the Ynnic faithful and paramount to their morale.\n\nWhat followed was a brutal 15 year long siege, where the Rzentur would be forced to split their sieging force into three groups to encircle the north and south ends of the dam while also besieging Mocvare's city. The next 7 years would be marked with fierce Mocvarian resistance, with bands of faithful Ynnics from other realms fighting along the southern bank, breaking the siege no less than 13 different times. A two year armistice followed, which was broken when the Rzentur once again marshalled a great force to encircle the city. This time, however, the siege was backed with weapons inspired by Cannorians, primarily in the form of gunpowder explosives which were deployed to break the dam's formidable defences. In spite of this, it would only be in 1610 AA when the Rzentur’s fire ended the reign of the water of the Ynn, with the final capitulation of the city. Whether an act of mockery, or of honour, the 381 remaining defenders were allowed to board a funeral barge and be sent down the Ynn."

Recent times, however, have seen Epednar visit for a different - though equally warlike - purpose. In 1317, a powerful tribe of Epednar rode upon our fortress. Fearing the worst, Lord Dalatan I faced the oncoming horsemen with the too-few militiamen at his command. Thankfully, conflict did not break out that day, as instead - to the Selocshan surprise - the Buycev tribal leader Auvuro called for parley.\n\nUpon their meeting, Auvuro guaranteed to the Lord that he had no intent to slay the defenders - though both knew he could. Instead, the Epednar were here to talk business: his tribe wanted in on the spoils of the Ynnic wars, and wanted the Selocshan to advertise and legitimise their ‘services’. In exchange, he offered protection from other tribes of Epednar - or from Dalatan’s fellow Ynnics - a protection the township evidently could use.\n\nThus, Auvuro’s tribe were granted governance over all the lands west of Selocshana Fort. More than a century later, the Selocshan still look at the tent-city of the ‘Auvukonyr’ with distrust - though most admit; playing host to the greatest horsemen this side of the Ynn does have its upsides."

These local names mean the same thing: “Thunderglade”. No other place across the Ynn can boast such a population of Thunderbirds, and it has become a common spot of visitation for Selocshan Sarda and Epednar alike. Children dare each other to run through the glade to prove their bravery, while adults sit in quiet contemplation, admiring the majesty of the glade’s inhabitants.

When the empire fell, the road did too, and it now is nothing more than a trail of shattered brick reaching out towards the distant mountaintops.

But no such barrier separates us from these new folk to our south and west, and early interactions have clearly demonstrated the superiority of their weaponry, social practices, and administration.

Better instead to sample Selocshan hospitality on the way to Adbrabohvi - so long as we convince them of that, we can enjoy first pickings of the Cannorian product.

In 1568 the Lord’s son, emulating his father, knelt in the current, praying for the flood’s end and struggling not to be swept away. He failed at both, and only by happenstance did the River’s Hands find him, unconscious and ill by the riverbank.\n\nThe disciples of Begga extended Her charity to the child, attempting to nurse him to health - until eventually, the Lord’s search led him to the roaming priests. Seeing what the Ynn had done to his beloved son, Lord Talvynn fell into a crisis of faith. He begged the River’s Hands for aid; they told him only prayer could save his child’s life. So pray Talvynn did - not to the Ynn, but to a foreign God - and a week later, his son miraculously awoke.\n\nPraising Begga, Talvynn became the first - and, for a long time, the only - Ynnic lord to convert to the Regent Court, breaking his oath to the River Priests of Adbrabohvi and further isolating his lordship from the disapproving Sarda. Though the other Ynnic realms denounced his conversion, many Selocshan had seen the good the River’s Hands had done, and tolerance of both Ynn Worship and the growing minority devoted to the Cannorian Pantheon became the norm within Selocshana."

That illusion was shattered during the Red Year, 1787, when Sarda found itself beset on all sides by enemies. The fortress of Selocshana saw itself facing a Cannorised army for the first time - and the modern Plumsteader forces were unlike any besiegers that had preceded them. The defection of the Auvukonyr at the promise of full integration into Plumsteader society and the subsequent surrender of the fortress marked the end of a near-millenium of home rule for the Selocshan, and saw the citizenry of that township become increasingly suspicious of any foreign influence.”\n\n-The New Sarda, Privinc Ostravyr, Sarda Demographer, 1844"

Once after such loss, she wandered far into the Rzenta forest, and arrived at a hidden glade, where a fey was waiting for her. The fey knew of her troubles and promised help, giving her a potion she claimed would make the one who drank it incapable of using magic. With a heart full of jealousy and a wounded pride from her recent defeat, the older sister accepted the gift and hurried back home. \n\nAfter dinner, the younger sister tried starting a fire with magic, but could not. As she continued trying to cast a spell, she became more and more anxious. The older sister smiled, her cursed deed being successful. In the meantime, her sister began to change as feathers began growing on her skin, her eyes turned black and her voice grew more beastlike. With her desperation at the fullest, the younger sister turned into an owlbeast. Shocked, the older sister watched in stupor as the beast lunged at her. \n\nNext day, the family's neighbours came to visit but were met with a ghastly scene.

Upon seeing the neighbours, she screamed at them to get away from her and fled outside, going into the same forest her sister went to the day before. \n\nYears later, the locals would sometimes claim to have seen a feathered lady wandering the forest, her transformation seemingly becoming more permanent with time.

Under the care of Eranian, the first New City - Nékhei - was built and a new era for all of the Kheionai began.

Its texts were primarily made up of a collection of scriptures detailing the lives of the average hardworking settler and the barbarians that oppose them.

In time, Eneion became a staple part of Basobhar tribal politics, which allowed Eneion to expand much more easily into the interior of Theinos (Devand), for Eneion could rely upon its preexisting relations with Basobhar tribes to protect its frontier.\n\nThe second was the summer worshipping Caamasi to the far north.  Their navigators had sailed south to explore Aelantir, and came into contact with Eneion through its fishing ships in the Kaydhano sea. The Eneioni where the first Kheionai the Caamasi met, creating a great first impression that helped establish great trading relations between the 2 mercantile civilizations.\n\nAnd finally came the Kheinor, a vast and diverse civilization from outside Aelantir. The first contact the Kheionai had with such a civilization came in the form of 3 massive exploration vessels flying lilac banners, that docked in Eneion's harbor in order to resupply. Eneioni diplomats left a great impression upon the Kheinor, and soon many more would come, in the form of merchants and mercenaries.\n\nThe legacy of these first contacts lay in the renowned diplomatic skill the Eneioni have, and the great relations that they developed with foreign nations."

These "Dranikites" where causing chaos and division within the city, and in a desperate bid to retain power and avoid internal conflict, Lokemeion exiled these radical philosophers and their followers, with the kylakas at the time, Eledas Akropolites stating "They can build their so called paradise, but not here. In Besolakí they will go." The exiling of the Dranikites started a long standing trend in Lokemeion, where those that disagreed with the established order would be sent to Besolakí, which resulted in a population boom.

The open door policy was put in place, where anyone that wanted to could enter Apikhoxí, grab a small plot of farmland for themselves, and as long as they protected it and stayed on it for 5 years, it would be theirs. As a consequence, many immigrants from across the Kheionai world, almost always of the lower classes, came to Apikhoxí hoping to build a better life for themselves.

While they were forced to work the fields, far from their friends and familly, their morale never wavered. Joined by constant shipments of convict laborers, Deyeion would become known as the prison colony. Deyeion’s early history was marked by constant revolts only being barely put down, with Degakheion often having to intervene directly. Eventually, after several generations, the descendants of rebels and criminals would wrestle control of the local government, reaching a compromise with Degakheion, recognizing their parent city as overlord while gaining much autonomy in return.

Soon, much of the population would fall in love with it, and even the state’s attempts at growing tea at home could not satisfy the demand.

Many a barbarian tribe would be defeated in battle, forced out of an area, and settlers would be sent to the area to secure it. This strategy worked well when dealing with the fractured and disunited Basobhar, but once Deyeion pushed deeper inland, it faced problems. An independent group of settlers headed deeper inland than the state had advised, near the land now known as Vexydhan, they were slaughtered. It was not a Basobhar tribe that had committed this atrocious act, but a mysterious group not well known to the Kheionai, the Mteibhar.\n\nUnlike the Basobhar, the Mteibhar were much more unified, and unlike the Basobhar, they could not be easily destroyed. The Mteibhar, seeing the Vexydhan settlers as a declaration of war by Deyeion, began agressively raiding and destroying any Deyeion settlements they could find, with one warband even reaching the walls of the city of Deyeion itself before being turned away. The deyeioni army, in turn, began an agressive campaign of burning every Mteibhara village they could find, and innovated new ways to counter the hit and run tactics the Mteibhara used. Eventually Deyeion, with the help of their allies, would push the Mteibhara back into their home valley, but the legacy of this attritional conflict remains in the new tactics and innovations Deyeion developed."

A shared trade policy, a common military, defined borders, and much more, the Échate league showed the Kheionai banding together would lead to prosperity for its members. When the great kheions of Alecand united in a great league of their own, it was apparent to many that the Échate League was what inspired them to do so.

Following the conclusion of the Wars of the Sorcerer-King, Saint Magda took it upon her own charitable soul to provide refuge to the innumerable widows of the war, many of whom would come from the devastated lands of Esmaria. This would inadvertently absorb a large portion of the sewing industry from the region and bring both peace and luxury to Magdalaire.\n\nUnder the banner of our dear Saint Magda, a unique culture of piety erupted from a spiritually stagnant population of urbanites. Such fervor would maintain the spirit of the city, unyielding even in subjugation and incorporation, leading to a new golden era for Magdalaire. This prosperity and prominence would allow the city limited autonomy even under a unified Anbennar, with the majority of power remaining in the hands of the local Wexonard and half-elf upper classes."

While other Wexonard towns still trapped under the Grand Duke's rule were forced to pay taxes to their liege and to the Emperor, we had the privilege of paying taxes and directly answering only to the ruler of All-Anbennar.

When said Dragonwake occurred, driving the Wexonards from the old Alenic lands into the then-Damerian Eastern Dameshead, the new rulers took it over and used it for the same purpose.\n\nAs time wore on, the often-disputed nature of the lands around Indlebury proved too much for the castle to handle, and it suffered terrible damage in a great battle. Therefore, what is now called the Old Bury was increasingly used only for political-administrative matters. The view of the average Indleburian is that it's a damned good use for such an old, venerable building."

What that old name was, or why the letters in 'Indelbury' switched like that, even the city fathers don't know. However, they do know where the name "Indel" came from, as do all their fellow citizens.\n\nThe great Indel was, depending on which Indlebury neighbourhood or township the person you're asking came from, a soldier, a mercenary, or a mage of great bravery and ability. Regardless of his background, two things ar clear: first, that he was a Wexonard, and second, that he single-handedly held off a bandit raid on what was to become Indlebury and so terrorized the brigands that had occupied what was to become the Old Bury that their leader simply surrendered after six hours. This feat was made even more impressive by his ability to dodge projectiles left, right, and centre."

For example, Indel's second-in-command, it is said, was the brother-in-law of the local halfling leader.\n\nThe halflings of Indlebury, especially in the rural hinterland, tend to be pig farmers. One particularly profitable tradition of theirs is to take these pigs out to hunt for expensive fungi the local dialect calls 'shrooms.'

After the rebuilding, the fire briefly faded into memory until a particularly idiotic Tellumite crier decided to use a pun and refer to it as the Kindlebury Incident. That horrible decision made the fire stick in people's minds throughout the Empire and caused the Emperor and the Grand Duke of Wex to take turns hitting their own foreheads with a thick book. More importantly, it set off a rash of folk-songs and both sober and inane speculation about why it burned.\n\nWas it malicious outside forces? Typically witless adventurers? Careless mages? Was it a bar brawl between Wexonards or the Lorentish or some other foreigners? Did someone light a match next to some flour, or did a cow knock over a lantern? We'll never know, but speculating is too fun to pass up; besides, the ideas we come up with might turn out to be useful for something else."

No matter where the people of Indalaberi originally came from, local or otherwise, they are all rude and stubborn. They have to be pestered even to move a crate from one end of the store to another to help their own mothers. Foreigners do not, in my experience, feel too out of place or unwelcome here simply because these Indalaberi people treat their own parents just as rudely."\n\n- From the writings of Nandaprabhan Janavarman, later Mayor of Bhuvauri, during his Anbennaric journey in the early 14th century."

It has been attempted to whip this behavior out of them, but the screams were only incorporated into the songs.

In practice they use wooden swords, striking hundreds, if not thousands of times a day. Even some, claiming to be remnants of Jaher’s eastern campaign, demonstrate prowess with merely their fists. When these masters spar it is in such a graceful manner it almost seems a dance, fluttering about each other in a flurry of movement. Should the day ever arise where these veterans are needed to maintain the peace they cherish, they will skillfully fight in the Repose's name."

It is unlikely such a place would do well as a resting place, given the treacherous trek to the monastery, if not for the fact that visitors are often elves. For others more unfit, this climb is near-impossible. Far, far, from the world below, the mountain's steep climb and winding path lead to necessity from a Repose guide to get up. Those confident to go without often never find their way off the volcano, never making it to the Repose. For invaders, this spells near certain doom. If not advantageous for the Repose enough, the high walls surrounding it are made of firm elven architecture, densely packed bricks capable of resisting simple attacks. These natural defenses, in combination with the walls, have deterred many an invasion from weaker forces, and convinced those stronger that it may not be worth the trouble."

However, instead of ushering in dark times for the region, the rule of Drosten proved to be very fruitful for Deamóine due to the River-Reaver's intent on inviting other races to Esmaria - and most importantly among them for Deamóine, halflings.\n\nThese halfling immigrants not only helped rebuild Deamóine, but shared everything they had with the humans in need, including much of their farming expertise.

And Xogariel,  the greatest savior, the oldest savior, the last savior, looked upon the Mayte and lent the help he could.\n\nIn the end, the Mayte bureaucracy was streamlined, its traditions upheld, its military strengthened.

At first, we expected them to just be another threat for us to face eventually. But then their envoys came to our gates, and offered us their knowledge and goods in exchange for ours. And with this, our silence, which had lasted for hundreds of years, was shattered.\n\nSince we were the easternmost Sarda settlement on the Veykodan tributaries of the Ynn we became the main entry point for Cannorian goods, and merchants, Cannorian and Ynnic alike flocked to our lands, turning little isolated villages into prosperous towns and clearing out thousand-year old forests to make space for new settlements"

They also believe that one day, a heir of Rhovynuc will ride from Veykoda at the head of a great host of dashing rogues, and with that host he will shatter the nobility and bring liberty to all Ynnics.\n\nThe only reason why the Buykonyr were never punished for this belief is that such a story coming true was, in the eyes of nearly every Ynnic, simply impossible. But then King Jahanon of New Havoral did descend from the mountains at the head of an army of bandits, and thousands of rangers and hussars flocked to join his host, believing that despite being a human, Jahanon is Rhovynuc's heir.\n\nDue to the influence of the Buykonyr, who by this point owned Arvezl in all but name, we peacefully submitted to Jahanon, who renamed the place New Havorton and chose it as his capital, which Arvezl's riders boast about at every possible opportunity, even though Jahanon's kingdom eventually fell."

Most famous of these is Castle Twin Spears, a Balgabaric-style keep which was meant to be Jahanon's seat of power and occupies nearly the entirety of Old Arvezl, and the Arvezl Academy of Economics and Trade, one of the first universities in the Ynn, built in the shape of a traditional Ynnic temple."

It is in this architectural wonder where the Crownsman famed contracts reach their peak: the main institute of law in the Damescrown. \nThe building itself is ancient: some say the foundations date back to the years before the Ash, while its gold and alabaster walls change between Castanorian, Esmarian, Damerian and Elven influences: Stout walls and dragon engravings mix with the arms of Anbennar, ornate Elven motifs decorate windows of Varainéy glass...  all dedicated to Nerat and the sacred Rule of Law. \n\nThis mixed building tradition grew into its own Crotháni style, centered around practicality and beauty, but it was during the rebuilding after the Corinite Wars when the Crotháni style truly shone, finally taking the center stage as entire patrician neighbourhoods were rebuilt following the trend born in the Hall of Golden Scales."

Growing with the years as the city turned into its modern law-centered self, the original Sailmarket turned from sails to various types of cloth, founding its own pole of attraction under the colossal shadow of Damescrown. With the centuries, the Sailmarket fair became a known meeting place for Esmarian fashion designers hoping to find revolutionary materials before their competitors, some going as far as equipping their party barges with sails made from Crotháni cloths to the horror and amazement of their fellow Esmarians. \n\nSailmarket cloth used for sails?

So brutal and effective was the way in which she dispatched the warriors of Irsmahap that she was bestowed the epithet 'Slayer-of-Slayers'. Rakkaz I ultimately perished in battle against the gnoll warriors of Viakkoc during the Battle of Kheterat, leaving our pack to the command of her daughter Rakkaz II, who quickly gained the reputation of a brutal warlord even by gnollish standards.\n\nThough Rakkaz I was a loyal vassal of Grizaka, Rakkaz II 'Slayer-of-Slayers' would oppose the founding of Gnollakaz, instead choosing to break off her pack and lead her hyena-riders south to raid the lands of Tijarikhet. From there she declared Grizaka’s proclamation as “emperor of gnollkind” to be hollow words, and vowed to live up to her bloodline’s name by slaying her."

What is known, however, is that the place hums with demonic energy, and it has been host to warlocks longer than our pack has ruled.

Goaded by their warlock advisors, our pack’s rulers now fill them with all number of dissenters and rivals, each of whom meet slow, miserable deaths at the hands of fighting-slaves and wild animals.\n\nConsequently, the land now menaces with a palpable suffering that emanates from these fighting pits - a dark gift to the night hags of the Shadowswamp whom these warlocks are truly courting. The hags feed off of extreme suffering, and so tolerate our pack’s existence and sometimes even deign to empower a warlock to act as their agent."

The resulting hellhound is imbued with all the fury and rancor of a lesser demon - a hateful beast that dominates the battlefield, seeking to avenge itself upon all mortals.

The corpses of dead gnolls were brought to the dark bogs of the Shadowswamp and left to mummify in the peat. Midway through the process a slave was tied to the burial site and left to starve, their suffering giving rise to a necromantic energy which suffused the mummified gnoll, allowing it to be possessed by a dark spirit. From this ritual a witherling was born, ready to be bound to a warlock’s will through fell magic.\n\nWitherlings made for ideal foot soldiers, for as undead they were ignored by demoncollar hyenas and were capable of receiving the brunt of any attack without complaint, and as former gnolls they retained a savagery and strength of their own. Ultimately, their greatest asset was a total, unswerving loyalty to the warlock who bound them."

Not even our mightiest warlocks could match the zeal of those scrap-worshippers, the boons of night hags and demons alike crumbling in the face of Kvangahga. Even as the warlocks fled our country in fear, however, a bold gnoll gladiatrix named Yeeno 'Trampler-of-Fools' seized power and rallied the last of our hyena-riders in a glorious charge against the enemy. Yet it was all for naught, as the gnolls of Haraagtseda levied forth their guns and cannons and decimated our riders before they could even draw blood.\n\nThough Yeeno's charge ultimately proved futile, her memory lived on in the survivors of the siege and was often commemorated by those who resisted conversion to Kvangahga."

It was home only to small bickering packs being manipulated and set against each other by the vile hags of the Shadowswamp to the south. The arrival of a coalition of Bonegnawer Gnolls fleeing religious persecution in the 1440s would change the fate of this land. Led by the young Pack Lord Rozherg, these Salahad nomads following the ancient Kvangahga faith joined forces with the ambitious witch-seer Izaba to seize control of her sister’s pack and establish the city of Haraagtseda in the heart of the savannah.\n\nImpressed by the powers of the Kvang Priest-Smiths among the Bonegnawers, Izaba and her pack converted to the faith of their new allies, establishing for the first time in centuries an independent Kvangahga realm in the gnollish world. The success of this new state would draw to it both Kvangahga packs from abroad, and those disillusioned with the Xhazobkult, leading to an influx of settlers that would expand the gnollish frontier deep into eastern Sarhal."

These wasteland nomads had a reputation as feared marksmen, using crude yet effective crossbows constructed from scavenged materials to outrange numerically superior foes and limit their losses.\n\nWhile the Bonegnawers were later integrated into the greater Fieldstalker population, their preference for ranged warfare led to their descendants being among the first gnolls to widely adopt firearms. Long after they abandoned the diet of their ancestors, Haraagtsedi warriors would continue to mark their faces with white warpaint to emulate the bone dust that marked the faces of the original Bonegnawers, providing a stark contrast to the smoke stained fur of those gnoll gunners"

Thanks to the veritable bounty of junk being brought into the city by foreign merchants, the Kvang Priest-Smiths of Haraagtseda were able to practise this ideal with gusto. From the invention of the Scrapmetal Fragmentation Cannon, to the Wastewater Recycler, Haraagtsedi Priest-Smiths demonstrated their capacity to create useful new technologies out of unlikely and waste materials that most other artificers simply wouldn’t have bothered with.\n\nThis tradition of wasting nothing often extended to the non-tangible as well, leading the gnolls of Haraagtseda to reconsider concepts and ideas that other nations had abandoned or failed to use effectively, repurposing them to fit their needs and trying things a different way, eventually leading to the establishment of the "Eglezalt" school of philosophy among the educated classes dedicated entirely to this concept of scouring the history books for failed concepts to repurpose and retry."

The royal line as descendants of both Izaba and Rozherg were seen as the exemplification of this union, carrying Rozherg's title "Hammer-of-Kvanga" as well as his mystical weapon of the same name as potent symbols of office.\n\nThe copper-hued war hammer was an ancient relic of the Kvangahga faith and was said to imbue its wielder with great strength and cunning. The hammer featured heavily in the royal rituals of Haraagtseda, particularly around the succession, each child of the royal blood, be they male or female, would be tasked with using the mighty hammer to assist in forging a crown of their own, with a council of the greatest Priest-Smiths in the realm assessing the skill, diligence and craftsmanship of the prospective heirs"

As adherents of Kvangahga, the Haraagtsedi valued efficiency, and burning slaves on a pyre or working them to death like chattel just isn’t efficient. Instead they invested in their slaves, feeding them, housing them, allowing them to have families. As a result, Haraagtsedi slaves developed a reputation for being strong and healthy, hard workers who were highly sought after in the flesh markets of the Ofehibi and in Rahen.\n\nThey were even allowed a chance at freedom through the Trial of The Reforged Chain, a Kvangahga ritual that became so popular it led to the establishment of a class of free humans in Haraagtseda. The Yavridav or “Chainless” became such a significant part of society that influential Yavridav eventually successfully lobbied for the abolition of slavery altogether in the 1840s, causing a near economic collapse as Haraagtseda adjusted to a free labour force."

However by the 1800s this city of tents had transformed into a metropolis of forged metal and glass, a sprawling mega-city drawing in more people with each passing year.\n\nThose gnolls disillusioned with the Xhazobkult and the megalomaniacal dictators of central and western Sarhal flocked in their droves to this beacon of comparative liberty in the east, and the Priest-Smiths of the latter centuries of the period were all too happy to meet the challenge of housing them, building sky-high tenements of magically reinforced scrap-metal. Competing Priest-Smiths would build ever higher towers, employing more and more unsteady methods of construction to achieve their goals until the “Great Wreckage” of 1782 forced the government to step in and set limits on their construction."

Maxota “Gifter of Chains” brought many of these tribes into her army with promises of great bloodshed and abundant food, the savages served as excellent shocktroopers and spawned a tradition of unarmed, brutal combat in the Kogzallan military.

We, who are the contemporaries of the enlightened and civil­ized nations of Aelantir and Cannor, who behold the advantages which they enjoy under the protection of the impenetrable bastion of civilized law, find it no longer possible to suffer, without cowardice and self-contempt, the cruel yoke of the Kheions who have weighed upon us for more than a millennia.

They each had their own unique culture, distinct from the great Kheions out west. Eventually, they grew to be very different, forging their own identities.

To us it seemed impossible that any large towns or cities would exist here without major effort from both the Kheions and their settlers. Unfortunately, the Alecandi refused to provide much if any support besides basic necessities. It was up to the newly arrived settlers to bear the weight of building the colonies.\n\nWithin a short timespan, all of that had changed. What was once the largest forest witnessed by the Kheionai had turned into lush fields, farmlands, and even large towns and bustling communities. They had even found growth in their economy through the slave trade of the Bashobhar.

Even with the threat of the Bashobhar diminishing, there are still predators and monsters that would love to eat an elf for lunch. Thus, the special training of how one should approach the highlands and its dangers is of the utmost importance.

They were by no means professional, but they showed their bravery and prowess in battle. They were treated as honorable elves by the citizens of the Nékheis, serving their country of their own volition. It was not uncommon for the most experienced of the Phylakíor to be given the honor of being incorporated into the army as fully fledged military personnel.\n\nMany Phylakíor groups continue to operate as local police in remote areas, serving when the army cannot.

Tragically, though, progress was halted. Somewhere along the line, the cities had splintered on what their destiny was.

Yet, despite this, a feeling of hope and even pride permeates the soldiery. For if the Sitewosi can withstand even the harshest of punishments and survive, then surely they could weather them all and eventually claim superiority.

Oddly, the ebony inherits the flexibility and relative ease-of-harvest of wood, but also an optimal hardness and sturdiness for armour and especially weapon-crafting. Often described as a “wooden metal”, the Sitewosi long ago discovered the painstakingly arduous process of working such a wondrous material. It has ever since brought them great wealth from professional adventurers, collectors, and trusted allies seeking to possess the fabled “ebony axes of the southern Mengi”. It is half-joked among the Sitewosi that the trolls of Yezel Mora never feel fear, but ebony-clad warriors wielding razor-sharp, ebony axes fit to slice through limbs like air afford them a close second."

In such situations, when all the kings are threatened, accords of unification are agreed upon. The weaker kings submit willfully to the strongest and wealthiest king and offer their armies and wealth under the promise of ridding the lands of invaders and the return of what remained of said armies and wealth. In reality, however, once an invasion was repelled, the “Accorded King” would never surrender their power. This cycle of imminent danger, unification, and consolidation of power, only to break apart upon death of the king is seen by many philosophical Sitewosi less as a dreaded cycle of tyranny and more of an evolution of state - each ‘cycle’ improving upon the last to eventually result in a perfect, unified kingdom that will endure and prosper for all time."

As well, it is believed by the Ofehibi that the act of simply wearing the turban assists to ingratiate oneself to the native Raheni merchants they often deal with.\n\nA favourite, if morbid, folktale among the Ofehibi is that of the gnoll who was a young and eager slaver with a mind set to make a fortune. After his first successful slave raid, the gnoll ordered his caravan’s navigator to plot a route to the Ofehibi and upon arrival was furious at the sight of the “roundheads”, who he mistook as Raheni.

Upon being enslaved, the slave awakens to a new, holy purpose - cleansed of any past sins and reborn in the eyes of Amilak to serve dutifully. As for the slaver, his duty to feed, shelter, and perpetuate the enslavement of the wayward is equally cherished. However, because the Mengi people are accepted as sacred by birth, it is viewed reprehensibly for a Mengi to ever enslave or hold another Mengi in bondage. For this reason, any slave found in the Mengi will inevitably be a foreigner."

If a dhow is engaged, it can often use its small size and superior maneuverability to score effective, disabling hits on an enemy’s sails and rigging, allowing a quick escape."

As time wore on, the tales of such myth evolved into an opportunity for local subjects to confer with their kings, who traveled much like Ardimya-That-Was across their domains and beyond. Soon, merchants seized the opportunity to use the moving royal court to hawk their wares, and eventually it became an official part of the these 'Market Proessions' - where a king travels not only to hold court or engage in diplomacy, but to use such an occassions to share (and sell) the best their kingdom can offer."

Unfortunately, some lords, not realising the duties they possess, tend to treat their slaves... sub-optimally.\n\nBut that does not mean that a slave can just give up their duty just because it is difficult. If a slave proves faithless and rebels or commits suicide, we of the Yeteferen cannot show mercy for such a betrayal, as it is not only a betrayal to their lords but to our God Amilak.

From there, the Metobesebi developed a very significant tradition of writing, primarily pertaining to religion and law. By our hands the basis of the Mengi Myth was written; our scribes derived codified governance and teachings from the ancient djinn manuscripts.\n\nLater the Raheni came across the sea, and brought paper and their own script with them; this was a welcome innovation. However, thanks to the Myth Tablets, we did not go overboard with embracing the foreign at the cost of our own ways.

For instance, in one dialect 'warrior' may refer to a male soldier, but another dialect may have the same word refer to a female soldier due to an ancestral history of women warriors. This phenomenon makes imitating Metobesebi communications excruciatingly difficult for unlearned foreigners, and even our Mengi kin, and therefore makes monitoring or subverting our country no walk in a park."

Most landed in the north, but several ships of scholars and intellectuals found themselves on the coast of Bamdikizy. Welcomed in by the tribe's people, these migrants would settle in Onymapo and go on to form an advisory body dedicated to guiding the chieftesses of Bamdikizy.

 L52_mercenary_turned_monarch_desc:0 "Perhaps the lowest point for Bamdikizy was when they found themselves not only subjugated by their rival Tibokbo, but beset by pirates from the black port of Oronsinoma. Having received no support from their overlord, the chieftess of Bamdikizy, Tsiomeko Jungleraised, scrounged all that the tribe could afford and hired a famed Mazava naval mercenary company to defend the coast - the Ranmaro company.\n\nThe steep price proved itself when the mercenaries swiftly brought the pirates to heel, despite facing fierce resistance and innumerable offers to turncoat. These repeated showings of valour and loyalty soon became the talk of the tribe. In particular, the company’s captain, Volana, was soon elevated to local hero for reportedly spitting on a chest of riches offered as a bribe before kicking it off her ship’s deck.\n\nYet one problem would be replaced by another when chieftess Tsiomeko Jungleraised passed away suddenly in 1412. The resulting power vacuum and chaos quickly caught the attention of Tibokbo, who saw an opportunity to end their vassal’s quasi-independence. Desperate for a new leader, the fractured Bamdikizy turned to the now loved Ranmaro company once more. This time they offered the mercenaries not coin but a place in the tribe with Volana as chieftess. Stirred by their pleas, Volana accepted. What followed was an independent Bamdikizy led by Volana Ranmaro, first of the Ranmaro dynasty. Together with her former mercenaries, Volana would raise Bamdikizy and her fleets to new heights."

 L52_the_ranmaro_system_desc:0 "When Volana Ranmaro rose to the throne of Bamdikizy she brought with her the great shipbuilding traditions of the Mazava. This tradition centred around training numerous artisans on one or two specific aspects of shipbuilding, creating a large group of highly experienced and specialised craftsmen. These craftsmen then would utilise their experience to create their aspect of a ship as efficiently and expertly as possible, allowing each piece to be brought together and assembled faster than any team could build a ship from scratch.\n\nVolana, however, sought  to apply Mazava ways not to build new seafaring vessels, but to restore the crumbled remains of Bamdikizy’s towns and infrastructure. By bringing together Bamdikizy’s craftsmen and workers, then organising them in the same manner but tasked with rebuilding homes and other constructions damaged in the recent civil strife, Volana was able to reinvigorate the tribe’s infrastructure and lay down a precedent for a new, efficient system for construction."

The main principle of Fombarifisa was that to truly unite Fahvanosy a state would require aspects of all three Vyzemby cultures within its functions and upper echelons (key to this idea was the denial of the Fomarati as a separate culture from the Mboala). The prevalence of belief in Fombarifisa within the government meant that the state was more effectively able to integrate new lands."

These different breeds specialised to be  better suited to new terrain the warriors of Bamdikizy found themselves fighting on, such as the vast savannahs of the west coast, or serve different field roles in battle, such as seeking out the injured and carrying them back to Bamdikizy medics. With all these new uses for dogs, cavalry began to compose an even greater proportion of the nation’s armies."

 L52_specialisation_of_culture_desc:0 "Should Bamdikizy have come to rule all of Fahvanosy, they would have sought to do similarly to the halfling cultures what was done to the Bamdivy - specialisation into general roles in society. The Mboala would have served as warriors and rulers, also taking on the bardic aspects of the Fomarati, as the government would consider them Mboala. The Amazetany would have remained traders and innovators, while the Mazava farmed cloves and worked to produce and maintain a navy powerful enough to exert influence across Sarhal. By utilising the different traditions and perceived strengths of each culture most effectively, a Bamdikizy led Fahvanosy would no doubt have been more than the sum of the three peoples."

While Ioriel herself was the greatest guide to this new era, Kyliande takes pride in being among the first to bear their new elven culture. Morganne síl Kyliande, in marriage and conception to Alvarion Duskwatcher, began the transformation of the rough Lorenti into the refined Lorentish.\n\nNot far from Lorentainé and the Rewanwood before they became the Redglades, but far enough away from the bustling cities: Kyliande is where many Elves fell in love with the idyllic farmlands of the Upper Bloodwine.

Inseparable in their youth, they walked hand-in-hand by the Bloodwine, dreaming of their great future together. But the clarion call of war summoned Beltram and his father to fight against Black Castanor, leaving Morganne alone. Beltram fought valiantly at the Battle of Elderlan, the last counterattack by Castanor, where his lord father perished. Morganne soon found herself ruling both estates, as Beltram's mother had passed from sickness and her own father defenestrated.\n\nThe triumphant hero returned home to his beloved bride. A bittersweet wedding was hosted, a gloomy air of the dead lingering over them. Underneath the light of the full moon, Morganne paced through the gardens and met the most beautiful rose: Alvarion Duskwatcher. An exceptionally handsome elf, Alvarion found it no trouble to entrance and seduce the young duchess. And while the night was still young, Morganne took Alvarion to bed. Beltram too thought to pay his bride a visit and stumbled upon this encounter.\n\nThe broken vows between houses Kyliande and Ventis, and the marriage of Morganne and Alvarion, is considered one of the major catalysts for the conflicts that began shortly thereafter between the elvenized Lorentish and the traditional Lorenti."

Morganne found herself facing against the combined forces of Beltram and the Rewantis on their way to depose the elven queen, as well as her own head. War raged across Lorent for years, but the Siloriel crown persevered. The rebellious lands along the Bloodwine, as well as the remnants of the great Rewanwood, were partitioned amongst loyalists.\n\nFollowing the rebellion, the lands of the síl Kyliandes were greatly expanded as reward for their loyalty to Ioriel. Former lands of the Rewantis were distributed to Kyliande, including portions of the Rewanwood not incorporated into the Redglades. Years later, their woodlands would become something of much greater importance. \n\nDuring the Interregnum following the death of Empress Jexis and the fracturing of the Phoenix Empire, the half-brother of the slain empress sought revenge against Ioriel Redrose.

The third son of a king ruling a minor kingdom, Tivara was not expected to inherit, and spent his early adult life as an adventurer, defending common folk from monsters, never expecting fame or title. When his two elder brothers unexpectedly died, Tivara inherited the realm from his father, and returned to rule his kingdom. From this small Setar state, he began his wars of consolidation - first taking the dry plains of the South and East Marutha, then striking the mighty Nadimraj and seizing its crown while it was embroiled in civil war. Finally, Svrinrangam forced the 14 princedoms of the Dhenbasana to acknowledge him as Maharaja, and he proclaimed the unified Rahenraj from his original palace in Setarudhar in 956 BA."

The thankful dwarf told Svrinrangam that the necklace would bless any who wore it with fortune and joy as long as they held it in love and filial piety. Tivara took the necklace in thanks, and wore it all the days of his life.\n\nIn the millenia that followed the first Rahenraja’s life, the Peridot of Svrinrangam changed hands many times, bringing good luck to all who held it. It eventually landed in the hands of the Thousand Strikes Dynasty, a powerful clan that ruled the lands north of Dhenijansar from Djunadesh to Kramitra, and at first it seemed only to increase their fortune. When the Brother's War broke out, however, the house turned on itself, and the once radiant gems of the Peridot necklace turned sickly and murky.

Shielding his eyes, the wanderer could swear he saw a great golden lion in the distance, shimmering amidst the buffeting sands. The lion stared at him for a moment before turning and striding away, disappearing into the sandstorm.\n\nWhen the tempest subsided, the wanderer followed in the direction of the beast and found himself less than a league away from his home village, where he had been given up for dead.

The man who led the fleet was the king of Saikinoma himself, Masana Meblic. Meblic was a young man who had grown up to become one of the most prestigious academics and cunning generals. Nobody could deny his talent, not even the king of Saikinoma, who allowed a young Masana to have his daughter’s hand in marriage. Now in the light of the public, he became perceived as generous for using the wealth gained through his various campaigns to improve the city of Saikinoma itself, and to give back to his people.\n\nEventually, once the old king of Saikinoma died with no heir, Masana stepped up to lead the nation.\n\nDuring the Meblic rule of Saikinoma, he conquered local cities and took the wealth of the rich to give back to the poor. He often personally traveled to the slums to deliver wealth and prosperity. Thus, Saikinoma as a kingdom grew to conquer and grow as a regional powerhouse. This brought fear to the kingdom of Kolonoma, who declared war on them to try and halt the great kings’ progress. Unfortunately for both of the cities, a new threat would arise. A grand human migration would storm the region, and after the battle with Kolonoma, Masana had to march back home to relieve his city from a horde of humans seeking to pillage. Masana had lost his wife and his kingdom, and only had his people left.\n\nThus, he expended all his wealth to build a fleet to save the citizens of Saikinoma from the human invasion, and to flee to the Summer Isles. In doing so, Masana Meblic reignited his people’s hope for a better life, and forged a new home in an unrecognized territory."

This has resulted in a group of people who have forged their own unique culture compared to the rest of the isles. Rayafo, being a kingdom of refugees, holds their traditions from Saikinoma strongly. One such tradition is the ancient art of Philosophy.\n\nIt starts with the iltraray, the council who advises the king, kneeling on pillows around a blue flame cast by the mihipha. The iltraray then begin their discussion, with a general forum of no less than 300 people discussing the politics of the nation. Then, after the politics have been discussed, and nothing is left, the iltraray call upon the gods, and begin the true discussion.\n\nThere is to be a speaker, who shall be the lead of the conversation and the receivers. The speakers bring up a topic, and the receivers respond. Nobody is to go out of order, as it is disrespectful to interrupt the discussion. All ideas, concepts, or theories, brought forward must be depicted in great, vivid detail, usually through metaphors. Unlike regular discussion, the true discussion should not be limited by politics. Nature, life, and stories are frequently talked about. These discussions are said to bond the iltraray with life and the gods, and provide heavenly wisdom like no other."

It has been said that Meblic saw this as a sign to continue forward, and the refugees saw it as a blessing from their gods. Arriving onto the coast of the Vyzemby isles, Masana had begun to organize the many refugees, and began the Great Settlement. In honor of the great light that he saw, he named the first settlement Mapiltra, the Skyhome. The refugees-turned-settlers immediately began to reconstruct their homes, and establish themselves quickly in these new lands. They were dubbed the fire starters, from where the name Rayafo originates. Mapiltra grew exponentially, and the nearby lands of Tsomindy were settled by farmers, which funneled food into the city. Alafo would soon become a center for wood and materials, which would be used to make new buildings and fortifications.\n\nAnd thus, the kingdom of Rayafo was forged out of the dust of a fallen kingdom, and the Rayafosi had fully settled down into their new homes.

Thus, the ships were renovated, and former sailors who had once guided the Rayafosi away from tragedy would now guard the coast of Rayafo. Pirates struggled to break their waters as the eternal fleet stood by, everpresent.\n\nUnfortunately for the Rayafosi, they failed to maintain their navy. Pirates came less frequently, and soon were near foreign to our coast. They would have benefitted from converting our fleet into trade vessels, but by then the economy had been whittled down by trying to maintain such a large fleet for war. Now they had once again been docked at port, and some faced irreparable damage. Thus, the ships were scrapped for parts, and only a few would remain.\n\nNow though, if we are to retake Saikinoma, a navy is needed.

The wealthy should help the poor, a lesson carried from Masana Meblic’s generosity to the impoverished.

This way, science works for the Rayafosi in a way like no other. When in times of war, we devote our scientists to creating new weapons and tools that could give us an advantage on the field. When at peace, we focus on developing our cities and strengthening our home security.\n\nThis has led to massive scientific developments across our country, and a unique system where innovators work for us. This is shown in the Mapiltra University, where historically, some of the finest weapons in all of Sarhal have been invented and allowed us in our times of need to defend ourselves. \n\nWhether it be a spear or a new invention to drive our economy: if we believe in its importance, we will make it."

That would change when a terrible sandstorm swept over the caravan she was guarding. When the storm cleared, she found herself alone with the caravan nowhere in sight. Rather than relent to the desert’s oppressive heat, she persisted. For days, the gnoll wandered the desert surviving off what little the land had to offer. \n\nYet even with her iron will, the Salahad would have certainly taken her had our founder not encountered the council of shamans who had been on their own decades-long desert exodus. As if expecting to meet her, they gifted her the name Irkorzik and pledged their support to her, declaring her their Pack Mistress. The subjugation of  the other lesser Windhowler packs soon followed, giving rise to our pack. \n\nThe following years were a prosperous and stable time for our people. As such, before her passing our Pack Mistress made a final decree. Succession of the Irkozik pack would not be decided by bloodline nor bloody infighting, but through proving their strength and skill in the Salahad, and those who succeed would take on the name Irkorzik themselves. In time, our pack would call this the \"Trial of the Sands\"."

But ultimately, it was one of these humans, a planetouched woman named Biakata, who led our kind to conquer the Binwarji lands and establish the Second Fangualan Empire. Through Biakata's legacy, we are reminded that strength can come from anywhere; it may not even be a gnoll who guides us in future victories. Thus, we are willing to establish accords with conquered peoples, so they may perhaps one day follow in her footsteps."

As time moved, empires both local and foreign pushed the Irkorzik deep into the desert, making a manageable inconvenience into a debilitating one. However, one day a group of Delta Gnomes wearing curious attire were encountered traveling through the desert as if it was nothing. Upon inquiring about the suits, they explained that they were \"survival suits\" that keep the wearer cool. They offered to manufacture simpler versions for us for a small fee, which we agreed to. While fashionably questionable, the results spoke for themselves, the suits making a trip through the hottest parts of the desert feel uncomfortable at worst. The suits saw widespread use in the horde, allowing our forces to fight with their full energy under the beating sun."

He did so because his dear friend, Diakarida, who saved the Empire from the gnolls, was executed for trying to improve his peoples' lives. In a grand display of his planetouched might Banni buried the imperial palace with an earthquake, killing the entire royal family and collapsing the Empire with it.\n\nWe, his descendants, uphold Banni's memory.

Ashakani glass-art of this period is characterised by asymmetrical composition and the ‘khirop’, the sense of arrested movement - a spear almost striking the neck of a warrior, a vase about to smash, an abstract shape seemingly on the verge of collapsing.

The Khet considered the tribute mostly symbolic of fealty as the actual amount was negligible. They didn’t realise quite how deep the gold mine of Imbushid was. Whenever Khet administrators visited the region, they were struck by the modest lifestyles the people lived in. This was because the leaders of the Imbushid enacted strict bans on gold jewellery to hide the extent of their golden horde.

The story is intentionally full of holes, errors, and contradictions (Lakanya will change genders multiple times in the story) and the storyteller must come up with increasingly elaborate explanations for these errors if challenged on them.

Fortunately, the most appropriate possible location lies ready for us: the seat of the 1st Fangaulan Empire still stands, ready to be rebuilt. We have renovated and furnished it so grandly and completely that all visitors will realise the splendour of our nation and of our heritage.\n\nOur king sits upon an ebony throne flanked by elephant tusks and shaded by a large silk parasol topped with a silver donkey. To his left stands his court Jelli, who carries a silver three stringed sintir, the high priest, and the court healer bearing the horn of the mythical Abada, an antidote to poison and disease. To his right stands the royal executioner, the king’s planetouched bodyguard, two of the king’s favourite white horses, and two rams to protect against the evil eye.

In the hands of the Binwarji, the ritual lost all religious pretence. It became entertainment for the nobles and lower class, as well as a way to showcase the cultures and peoples subjugated by the Fangaulan Empire’s military might. Frequently, former soldiers of conquered peoples would be forced to fight in arenas for their conquerors’ amusement. As time passed however, individual Gladiators became more and more respected and famous, with those who won their freedom becoming respected landowners or even nobility.

The cultures around us create sculptures that could never be fooled for the real thing while our artisans have created  ivory, terracotta, bronze, and wood artworks that are extremely lifelike. There are even legends that one bronze sculpture was so enchanting that its artist attempted to marry it. Many foreigners admire our artistry, with Cannorian traders even spreading the rumour that a long lost tribe of dwarfs must reside within our borders, due to the profound craftsmanship of our sculptures.

We pull back again and again to an innumerable series of remote and camouflaged fastnesses, avoiding direct engagement; each village knows the location of a few, and keeps them swept clean and stocked with supplies.

From great statues, to temples, palaces, and tombs, the people of the Mother’s Sorrow have a history of creating great works. This has created a storied history and wealth of knowledge to draw upon for future projects and lesser works that the average Kheteratan may be able to appreciate more, such as bridges, plazas and roads.

Hunger is often far from the minds of the average farmer, and thus all they support. Grain, vegetables, flax - all are produced in great abundance and lead to a wealth unheard of for the lower class in other realms.

Whilst still loyal to the Khet, they see the excess and grandeur of the priesthood as unnecessary and a misuse of their authority. Strong supporters of Aakhet due to a secret prophecy that the brotherhoods had kept for centuries, after his death and the arrival of the Crodamos dynasty and the introduction of a true "noble" class, they had doubled down on their belief of being champions of the common folk, making them well beloved by those they have sworn to protect, and recruit from."

When the Crodamics moved from Akan to Kheterata, they found their horses unsuited for the soft desert sands and intense heat of their new home. Instead, they adopted the local’s traditions of camelry, or “camel cavalry.” Transferring their extensive knowledge and tradition of riding on horseback to this new medium, making use of lances derived from the ones their ancestors once used on the plains of Cannor, the Crodamic Camelry are a strong noble class of camel-riding warriors, who often challenge the Ahati brotherhoods for military dominance."

Regardless of this, however, Kheterata has remained largely unchanged. All of these invaders were forced to submit to the authority of the reigning Khetarch, or be destroyed by the divine protectors of Kheterata and expelled from their conquests. In times when they refused and the Khetarchs themselves could not be moved to act and unleash unnecessary suffering upon their people, Elikhet himself would rise from the grave to effortlessly excise the stain, ruling for a time to set things right, before returning to his slumber. In the case of the House of Crodamos, they would themselves become Kheteratan in their own right, a dynasty that has lasted nigh on a thousand years, and may last a thousand more!"

The emperor had made him governor of Negefaama due to him and his companions involvement in the killing of the twin xhaz. When touring his new lands he desired to visit isolated Kaino villages that many of the dominant ruling class pretended did not exist until tribute and warriors were needed. After spending months among these isolated Kaino peoples he returned with A new republican system that was inspired by his time among these isolated Kaino tribes. This system consists of autonomous villages and cities ruled by diffused authority without a formalized, permanent, or hereditary leadership position. It was a direct democracy on the village level with a representative assembly elected by village elders, mages, priests, secret societies, representatives of the Council of Women and all male adults. Diakarida was convinced that this system would lead to his province and eventually the empire to become more flexible, adaptable and fair, preventing the tragedy of the twin xhaz invasion. This idea was too radical for the empire and was seen as a threat to the empire's authority leading to the hero who had saved Fangaulas execution. The outrage of this crime led to the birth to the Kingless land of Negefaama with the system implemented to honor the great hero who was unjustly murdered.

Powered by an elemental bound to the golem by damestear, the artificers finally recreated the golems of the ancient past.\n\nWhile these new prototype golems were not nearly as effective as the genie-bound golems of old in warfare, they excelled in construction. A golem needs no pay, no safety requirements, and is stronger than a human laborer.

In the late 17th century, Cannorian missionaries and traders would start preaching this truth themselves, but with a twist: they had found the last remnant of God in this world. Negefaama, already closely connected to Cannor through trade and diplomacy, quickly converted to Ravelianism, becoming one of the first nations in Sarhal to do so. With their quick and easy conversion, Negefaama created a strong alliance with Ravelian powers in Cannor, which helped stave off foreign domination by playing Cannorian powers off of eachother."

A long time ago a great king Named Ndurubu decided to explore the entire world. He traveled north where the air was cold and snow fell during the rainy season and even visited the land of the immortals to the west. Yet when he visited the savanna he fell in love with its beauty and great animals to hunt. He loved it so much after his travels he decided to resettle his entire people to the savannah. They adapted so well to the land that when the king died he was reborn into the first lion Fojara. Whenever a Ndurubun dies they are reborn as a lion and whenever a lion dies they are reborn as a Ndurubun. That is why the Ndurubu people possess blond hair, and why we share their bravery.

While our neighbors call us thieves they are simply misinformed. All the hooved animals in the world are property of our people due to our god Fojara Being married to one of the Ujun. Our God being married to the mother of cattle means that all of her children are rightfully under our ownership.

Thus it is our duty as Ndurubu to rid the world of Gnolls. When we were the foundation of the Fangaula imperial army we were never allowed to purge them from the savannah despite their raids as the Binwarji relied on their connections with the slave trade.

A king may ask their court Jelli about how the kingdom is dealing with a famine only to be told “Quite badly sir, after all you are only eating six meals a day! You must be starving constantly!”. When asked by a Cannorian trader about their role in Taafi society, a Jelli responded with the parable of Makan and the king of gods Aro, where the conquering god Aro forces Kanhati, the god of death and wisdom, to teach Makan manners after Makan mocked Aro constantly in front of the other gods. Kanhati confronted Makan and their war of words turned into a game of wits, which Makan won.

Of all the gods Makan appears most often to mortals, usually during the night around slave quarters. In the daylight she plays with the children, teaching them the best pranks and games. When she appears she plays her drum and the people, no matter their misery or sadness, will be able to dance and laugh and gain the determination to look down at their oppressors and foster small acts of rebellion. This angered the goddess Biakata and she allied with the gnoll goddess to destroy Makan's drum, causing her to learn the feeling of loss and sadness. In her search around the world to find a new drum to replace her broken one she eventually finds her “drum heart” , the drum every person has that one must play to become truly free. The story is told among slaves and rebels to build their courage to cast down their kings, slavers and tyrants using their inner strength. Makan’s worship was banned in the second Fangaula empire and became an important national symbol during the gnoll invasions that forced us to settle down.

Eventually we grew curious about the stars and the planets - curiosity that was rewarded with a madness born from looking upon the void above the skies of Halann too long. Finally after years of searching the skies with great care and replacing those driven mad with new sages, we uncovered a great grave secret of the dark creatures that hide between the stars. Unfortunately, this drew the attention of one of the dark gods. It descended into our dreams, driving most of our people mad. The few surviving sages led us off the island and performed a ritual to make the Taafi forget the island existed, and it disappeared into the mists shortly after.This story, our most secret, is known only from tattoos that were placed on the backs of those sages who did the ritual, and which we mark our wisest with still."

Despite this, our knowledge of metalworking endures and we continuously find smaller deposits of copper which the korebitamipi exploit and refine even to this day. In this way, most copper still passes through our land on its way to the river Yet’s trade routes, be it from our small village sources or in sporadic caravans from the vast mines of war-torn Dakinshiland to the south."

Over the centuries, however, it grew from a small village into a prosperous center of trade thanks to favorable laws and a little luck. As the city rose, so too did the power of the lords of Enikmesiki, who became the wealthiest of the Lesser-Kings across Shelokmengi. They were soon able to force their liege to grant them a degree of autonomy rarely seen among the Mengi nobility.\n\nIn 1430, a new king ascended the throne of Shelokmengi. Eager to secure his rule, the young king decided to make an example out of Enikmesiki, his first major edict confiscating the unique privileges enjoyed by its nobles. When their rejection of the decree inevitably came, Shelokmengi declared war.\n\nIn spring of 1431, the two feuding armies clashed outside the walls of the city of Enikmesiki. The battle ended with a stunning victory for the rebellious Lesser-Kings, and though Shelokmengi would return with its armies twice more, twice more they would be beaten. In 1438, the last of these battles ended with the decapitation of Shelokmengi’s king, leaving his 4 year old son the throne. Formal recognition of Enikmesiki’s independence was quick to follow."

Infuriated, Fetengoni would declare war. As Fetengoni was one of the most powerful Mengi kingdoms of the time, their victory seemed practically assured. At Zusedar, that belief was sorely tested.\n\nThe King of Fetengoni had ordered a bridge to be built in the area, in order to cross the Yet River with his great host. Enikmesiki had other plans. The night before the battle, half of Tariku’s army had crossed the river, and had hidden behind Fetengoni’s army. As dawn broke, and the Fetengoni army began to cross, the army of Enikmesiki surrounded the enemy host. All those that were not deemed valuable prisoners were killed on sight, and the King of Fetengoni himself would be taken prisoner.\n\nHe would only leave the dungeons of Enikmesiki after paying a massive ransom, but, in  one last insult, Tariku would personally carve a hideous scar upon his captive’s face…"

A kingdom in the highlands to the north, Werikgeta and Shelokmengi had always found themselves in conflict, seeing each other as traditional rivals.

Of particular note was the tradition of sending the most insulting of letters to Enikmesiki’s rivals on the first day of every month.

They returned with new knowledge and set to work constructing one of the most imposing fortifications in all of Melekmengi. Imposing and sturdy walls to resist nearly any bombardment were raised over vast underground grain storage that would keep the city fed during sieges and a massive tunnel network that served as an effective secret escape route.\n\nThe day the lords of Enikmesiki had long prepared for finally arrived in 1472, when a combined Shelokmengi-Fetengoni force marched towards their capital. The invaders had chosen the perfect moment, for Enikmesiki’s stalwart ally Werikgeta had fallen into civil war with the death of their king. Forced to fend for themselves, the fortress of Enikmesiki would be put to the ultimate test.\n\nThe siege was brutal for both sides, with the city completely surrounded.

The Saqraxati clans' competition has led to all clan heads being highly adept at capturing vast amounts of slaves.

This frustration is believed to have been one of the main motivations behind his coup, and one of his first actions upon taking power was to centralize the clove trade under royal jurisdiction, so that the Mazava would be paid what their goods were truly worth."

The Ilaakhidigaha Yaghin faith in particular caught his attention, impressed with the religion's focus on scholarship, philosophy and innovation. He took particular notice of how the spread of the new faith had coincided with the rapid advancement of Baashidi society and power during the Age of Glory.

He saw beings with skin white as chalk, with scaly growths on their waists and backs and serrated teeth like those of a shark. When a group fitting this description enters the tavern, the traveler’s shriek of fear is drowned out by the uproarious laughter of the locals. \n\nThe ‘ghosts’ are none other than the Ikishebe hunters and warriors, who traditionally sharpen their teeth into points, cover their skin with ash mixed with tree sap (following the old belief that the sap gives them the strength of the trees), and wear cloaks and belts of lizardfolk skin. The terror inflicted on this unsuspecting traveler is nothing compared to the terror they inflict on Isagumze's enemies, whom they harass with effective guerrilla tactics, to the point that many of their foes would rather fight actual ghosts than these brave and skilled warriors."

The gigantic lizardfolk hordes would surely invade them if the reptiles weren’t too terrified of the brave people of Isagumze to even think about it, an idea that has generated a bit of a superiority complex. \n\nAlthough their neighbors don’t appreciate the condescending attitude resulting from this, most of them recognize the importance of their labors. However, some voices question whether the accounts of the Ikilshebe about the dangers posed by the lizardfolk can be trusted, believing that the creatures could be negotiated with, and that the ruthless and cruel practices of the Ikilshebe are only breeding more hostility between the races.

This mistrust is a result of the rivalry between the monarchy and the Kulugi Abe, as the former frequently suspects diplomats to be secretly conspiring with the traditional nobility to fragment and weaken the kingdom, and the latter believe them to be collaborating with the monarchy to end their privileges and ban their traditions. Although this has sometimes made the relations of Isagumze with their neighbors difficult, it has also helped the country get rid of hostile infiltrators, as at least one of every three diplomats expelled or imprisoned for espionage was probably a real spy."

In addition to its defensive properties, the Ikilshebe soon came to appreciate this leather for its aesthetic value, and the elites of the kingdom competed amongst themselves in hunting the most beautifully scaled lizardfolk, turning them into magnificent armor as a way to show their status and stand out in battle. There is a particular preference for the serpentine naga, whose scales only the greatest chiefs and the kings wear.

This ambition even pushed them to bend the knee to Kheterata, in hopes of getting from them the resources needed to fulfill their destiny, but the authority of the Khet in Horashesh collapsed before this could come to be. \n\nThese setbacks did not demotivate the Ikilshebe, and they would continue to pursue this goal for centuries, organizing campaign after campaign against the lizards.

While he was held prisoner and about to be eaten, he decided to sculpt one final carving out of stone: the head of a great warrior. When the Ashhama came to him, however, they looked upon the head and the Blood-Madness was temporarily banished from their minds, and they promptly named Ruan their leader.\n\nRuan founded the city with the band of Ashhama. He finished the statue of the warrior and placed it at its center, setting the tradition whereupon each successor would craft a statue to place beside it.

If not our wealth then our techniques, the years of knowledge our smiths and artisans have generated, are surely unimaginable to these resourceless people.

Born a farmer, Yemane originally owned only a small piece of land. His great administrative skills and wit allowed him to increase the yields of his farm manyfold, and he began to increase the yields of other farms in the local villages. Eventually, he would be noticed by Ayufari II during one of his yearly harvest processions, was recognized for this skill, and hired as the king’s personal secretary.\n\nYemane would be a crucial advisor to Ayufari II for most of his reign, being responsible for many administrative reforms in the kingdom.

Leaning on their administrative skills, they raised a force of 10,000 men in one month and marched to the city of Berfan, directly in the path of the advancing Trolls.\n\nAt the gates of Berfan, Shelokmengi made its stand.

He also reformed the cavalry and completely abandoned the concept of Outriders in favor of heavily-armed lancers. These cavalrymen, calling themselves the Lasmarcai, were clad in the best armor available, and their lances were extended to enable devastating charges against ranks of enemy infantry weakened by gunfire. According to this concept, combat usually began with a slow advance of two ranks of infantry against enemy formations. As infantry bullets thinned the enemy ranks, cavalry units sprang into action, attacking the center and flanks of the enemy formations, making a devastating charge and then retreating, allowing the infantry to continue firing."

As a result, Laseáni vintners have developed something new. While technically not a wine, grain wine is seen with a similar reverence and referred to as such by those in Laseán. Slightly stronger than ordinary wine or beer, usually made from grains of rye or wheat, this pale wine-like drink, also called "Laseán Pale", is the pride and glory of the duchy.

His main supporters were the Vurebindu natives, tired of the Confederacy's oppressive taxation and of being treated like second-class citizens, although many Irsukuba also joined his ranks. This revolt would manage to successfully topple the Confederacy, replacing it with a centralized empire led by Kui and his descendents, who to this day still sit on the throne of Kuiika. \n\nUnder the wise leadership of Kui the empire achieved great splendor and prosperity, controlling all of modern day Horashesh at its peak, but his successors were not up to the task. The state slowly declined, with its borders being reduced to the immediate area of the Kuiziva lake and eventually becoming just another subject of Kheterata. The memory of this glorious past and its tragic loss motivates the people of Kuiika; they will rebuild this empire, and this time it shall never fall."

He had to face the fearsome warriors of the Ikursuba elite, and his army consisted mostly of Vurebindu peasants, more numerous but inexperienced and undisciplined. To remedy this he organized them into legions of 5000 men and put them through a harsh and short but effective training, which both prepared them for combat and thoroughly indoctrinated them to be unconditional fighters for Kui’s cause. These new troops proved incredibly effective, and Kui was able to not only push back the Ikursuba Confederation, but also to unify Horashesh under his command.

The effigy is accompanied by bands of musicians and poets loudly proclaiming praises and playing songs dedicated to Kui, and followed by seemingly endless masses of both pious peregrines and curious tourists from all over the world. The procession makes 4 stops, one every last day of a week, during which massive amounts of free food and alcohol are distributed and the people dance and sing until the next day dawns. In the fourth and final stop the effigy of Kui is loaded onto a great raft along with many offerings of both food and valuable objects, and they will all be covered in oil and rowed to the center of the lake by 10 men and 10 women volunteers. Only one of them stays in this raft, usually a very devout and old individual who sets the raft, and themselves with it, on fire while thousands watch silently from the shore.

Their former ally of Zuvavim, now turned competitor, had a powerful fleet that could wreak havoc unopposed in their newly obtained coast if they wished to do so. To remedy this the ruler at the time decided to undertake an ambitious naval build-up program, hiring a crew of Vizemby shipbuilders led by a particularly ambitious halfling, who promised that they could deliver a hundred ships within a year. As it turns out, building a hundred ships from scratch in a year from a single port with an improvised shipyard isn’t really possible, so the shipbuilders had only finished 10 ships when the term expired.

The nobles were of course outraged, and to calm them down Kenmu invited the most powerful ones to his palace to discuss the issue. \n\nOnce there he bade them pass into his garden, telling them that they would talk about the taxes after observing some beautiful roses recently planted. The twelve most prominent malcontents entered first, and after them the king stopped the rest and told them to wait, as some weeds had been found among the roses and they needed to be cut immediately, so that they wouldn't tarnish the beauty of the roses.\n\nWhen he finally let the nobles pass, they were horrified to see the 12 decapitated heads of their colleagues piled in a cart.

However, with the spread of Ravelianism in the nation this fact started being disputed, which caused the monarchy to oppose the new faith initially, as the ruling dynasty claimed to be descendants of Kui and their legitimacy benefited greatly from his assumed divinity. A compromise was soon reached, as the queen at the time believed embracing Ravelianism would speed the modernization of the nation. Kui may not be a god, but he would be a Saint, and so it was arranged. In a great ceremony coinciding with the celebration of the Kuiziva festival, which was attended by the High Rector Torrieth herself, the founder of Kuiika was officially canonized as Saint Kui, the queen was converted and Ravelianism became the new official faith of the kingdom of Kuiika, who would become the main diffuser of the truth of the One God in the region."

They declared their leader, Delian Whitecloak, the first Emperor of Anbennar. The lands around the Dameshead had known naught but war and chaos for decades, even centuries - some elven warriors hadn't seen a lasting peace since their arrival in Cannor. Delian Whitecloak and his compatriots envisioned an end to the endless conflict, brought about through a force that could cut through any king, any army: magic.\n\nThe Interregnum lasted sixty years. In six months, it was over. From Vertesk to Verne, from Beepeck to Bennon, warlords set aside their differences and their long standing feuds in the name of unity. Many had to be compelled to do so, through domination or destruction, but in the end they all welcomed the new peace.\n\nSince then, mages have held incalculable influence over the Empire's affairs. Only a mage could sit the Dove Throne. Magical ability was a requirement for legitimate succession. Even when the regime of Mage-Emperors came to an end during the Wars of Rule, they were replaced by the Magisterium, which ruled over the institutions of magic throughout much of Cannor, and controlled an Imperial electorate for centuries. While that influence has waxed and waned over the years, the notion that extraordinary abilities wielded by extraordinary people can change the world has remained.\n\nAnbennar, arise!

The Emperor spoke as if the great task was still ahead, not behind them. What could he mean? It was a simple yet effective rhetorical gambit - the curious audience listened in rapt attention as the Emperor expounded on the meaning of their words.\n\nSilver is the Empire's color, of its banners, of its coinage, of its diplomacy. Silver for the moon, or perhaps for Castellos. The influence of the half-elven Silver Families runs deep, as does, of course, their blood descent. The memory of the heroic Silver Band that expelled the Sorcerer King lives on in song and story. Silver arms kept evil at bay, and silver tongues brought the imperial princes together.\n\nSteel is simpler. Steel for the spears of Verne, for the muskets of the Vanbury Guild, for the guns of Giberd. Steel from the foundries of Telgeir and the forge of Anvilwright.

And yet this dream was bartered for in the blood of thousands with the end of the Interregnum. After thirty years of peace came the Wars of Rule, and thirty years of chaos and civil war.

The Ruin and the subsequent War of the Falling Stars between the Damerian Republic, Castanor, and the Gnomish Hierarchy laid waste to the region, but not for long. Wealth would continue to flow from the Divenhal to the ever-growing cities lining the Dameshead. The Dragonwake, the White Pestilence - in the course of history, these disasters were no match for geography and economics. The old cities made room, or at least provided construction material, for the new. The gnome-ruled Beepeck was rebuilt into a halfling-ruled Beepeck. The mouth of the Alen suited a city, and so a city arose; it did not matter if Vertesk was ruled from Castonath or Gaweton, or if its citadel tower was white or black. Damenath gave way to Damucen, which became known as Anbenncóst when the seas brought the elven Remnant Fleet to the Damesear.\n\nTruly, these tranquil shores have seen the tides of history crash and rage amongst them. There is the legacy and the destiny of the Empire and its peoples. As the Crownsmen saying goes, a ruler makes history, but wealth makes a ruler.

Soldiers of Emperor Lothane III marched through the capital of Anbenncóst, not in glory, but amidst flames, and carrying away loot. The Rose and Moon Parties licked their wounds and sharpened their daggers, and the Electors all but openly disregarded the emperor's will; Lothane III may have been a terror on the battlefield, but he was an old man, a Wexonard without silver lineage, with only a human's lifespan. Another, stronger and wiser, or maybe one more willing to "forgive" and "compromise", would soon come into the Dove Throne. After all, the success of a great man - or woman - with the will to dominate and restructure the Empire would come at the expense of the Empire's privileged princes. And if worst came to worst, the princes could always call upon Crothán to furnish a 'legal scholar' to defend their rights in the Imperial Court for a couple of decades.\n\nNonetheless, the Empire - with some considerable help from a certain faction - pulled itself together. The smaller states agreed to a new model of centralization that would protect them from the depredations of their larger neighbors. A common tax was levied for the first time in centuries. The Imperial Parliament was consolidated and streamlined into a functional legislature, with a permanent session. The Imperial Estates and the Prince-Electors were brought to heel, and with the revocation of the Privilege Against Appeal, the Emperor was once again the supreme authority of the realm.

In heraldry, this positioning is often reserved for the most prestigious titles. The moon represents the roots of the Empire in the Damerian Republic, ruled from Damesear, with a Parliament hearkening to the old Senate. Informally, and to a degree only formerly, the moon represents the Silver Families, especially the Silmunas. In the second quarter is the silver dragon, Castellos, for Castanor, the ancient empire of humankind and the original rulers of the Dameshead. In the third quarter is the golden phoenix of the Jaherian Empire, whose scion, Jexis, was the last great emperor to rule the lands that now form the Empire; her realm collapsed into the Interregnum with her death in 1161 AA. The inescutcheon features a dove carrying a branch: a symbol of peace.\n\nDameria, Castanor, and the Phoenix Empire - the heritage of Anbennar covers much of Halcann.

Ultimately, the war had to be ended by Sadealdhahk the Wise killing his own father and negotiating peace with his rivals.\n\nSadealdhahk was a competent ruler, and thus he was able with help from the merfolk to bring the Dhebiji peoples back from the depths of decadence by finding peace with the Ashamadi through conference rather than violence. Yet, a scar remained even after Sadealdhahk was gone, which united all who followed him: Beeragga was to never stoop to such levels of incompetence again.

Merfolk swimmed around with ease across their cities, as they dragged their human accomplices along to show them the greatness of the people underwater.\n\nSoon after, the merfolk managed to rework the device to allow for the merfolk to breathe water on land. As both civilizations explored each other's world, the relationship between Beeragga and Nguvu grew ever closer, melding and merging into one.

The Kneadsbridge Barrow turned out to have housed the tomb of Cerda, a near-mythical tribal king mentioned in old Halfling folklore, and produced some of the most spectacular grave goods ever found in the Small Country; the barrow's silver and gold regalia of ancient Halfling design notably inspired a popular jewelry brand in the Small Country with similar motifs of complex geometric shapes and animals."

In late 1444, he invaded the lands to the west that bordered the swamp. During the campaign, the soldiers of Simegasa noticed how weakened the enemy armies were, as if they were surrounded by bad luck and miasma. In truth, the hags had used their vile magics to weaken Dejen’s enemies.\n\nAt the battle of Sodikant, the combined armies of Dubishan, Tikur Adanyi, and Poson clashed with Dejen’s forces. Utilizing his superior cavalry, he employed hammer-and-anvil tactics to crush his enemies. The Simegasans gave no mercy, with less than a thousand of the enemy escaping with their lives. Dejen II would then annex the 3 kingdoms, tripling the size of Simegasa in a single day.\n\nOn the 14th of Nerament, 1444, Dejen II would be found upon his throne, a glowing purple brand etched upon his forehead, having become an undead slave to the hags.

This led to waves of warriors, bandits, and vagabonds pouring into Simegasa’s borders to join its army, solving Simegasa’s manpower problem.\n\nThe edict would be expanded by Simegasa’s rulers over time.

For the Kings, the coalescing of the region’s disparate chiefdoms into a single entity is a symbol of unity that has inspired Kidsit Yitsi to endure Tanizu raids and troll incursions - and that raises them above the fractured Kingdoms of the other Mengi.\n\nThis ideology of unity to face off adversity meant that, when the Angel Kamniel shattered the hordes of Yezel Mora and declared the Kingdom of Melakmengi, the Kings of Kidsit Yitsi saw it as the natural path of the supposed final Sitewosi Kingdom to be absorbed into the seemingly final Mengi Kingdom.

With this new availability of useful wood, an innovative construction method began to emerge in the region. By driving vast numbers of timber stakes into areas of the swamp, a large, solid, and stable surface could be created - the wood petrifying until practically stone.

The seemingly endless labyrinth of tunnels below hold texts dating back to ancient times, left undisturbed in spite of conflicts raging above. It is said that there are more texts within than stars in the sky, and while this might be an exaggeration, scholars estimate that cataloguing the library in its entirety could be a centuries long endeavour. Nevertheless, this task could prove quite fruitful. Surely there is something to be learned from so much knowledge; such as our people’s long lost history, or clues to discovering the secrets of the Zatsarya above."

Tensions arose between our people and the Naga long ago, but during an event known as “The Crackdown”, Naga advisors of the king pushed for the collection and destruction of all knowledge of its existence,wiping the origins of the conflict from history. Unfortunately for them, while they may have succeeded in erasing history, they could not erase its effects; distrust and open hostility to their influence permeates our society. Many more crackdowns have occurred since, but in an ironic twist have only served to increase the intellectual stimulation of the populace, as holding secret seminars and keeping hidden book caches became normal practice."

To take advantage of this, we have developed special boats that are designed for these conditions, focusing on speed and carrying capacity over hull resistance."

 L83_access_for_artificers_desc:0 "The status of the Yadirratala as the forefront of its kind in terms of sheer magnitude of information is not one hastily attributed. Around the beginning of the 17th century, there was a large increase in foreigners both near and far who came to us in search of knowledge, like the scholarly Baashidi, or the recent trickle of travellers from the far off continent of Cannor. While it might be prudent to keep this knowledge to ourselves, it would be a shame to bar entry to aspiring minds, especially when they have much to offer in exchange. There are those among these travellers known as artificers, who create devices to harness magic without needing to cast it oneself. We allow them to access a carefully vetted portion of the library's contents in exchange for their assistance in fostering this practice amongst our people, to great benefit. Artificery has opened the door to an endless sea of possibilities for us, finally shifting the balance in power between the Naga and our intellectual class."

 L83_the_new_state_desc:0 "The beginning of the end of Naga tyranny came with yet another crackdown, but this time it was more than just routine resistance. The increase in artificery among our people created unease amongst the Naga, whose magical abilities legitimised their social status. With the power they wielded becoming less relevant, they urged their puppet king to disband the growing artificer’s guild and outlaw the practice, lest these new ideas lead to a revolution. In seeking to avoid it, they brought the revolution on themselves. \n\nThe noble house of Katalend, who themselves became prominent in recent years due to their adoption of artificery, took the ban as a hostile declaration towards their house itself, and struck back against the regulations. A majority of the populace took to their cause, having seen first hand how beneficial artificer technology was to their daily lives. Together they swiftly ousted the ruling dynasty, replacing them with the house of Katalend. Ever since, they have passed vast reforms to strip the Naga of their power, in favour of the artificers they attempted to oust. The old makes way for the new, allowing Shangra to finally reach its full potential as a technological behemoth to rival all other nations in the world."

As a result, the most successful of our people tend to be those with more delicate claws, a mutation normally seen as a detriment, as hand-to-hand combat presents an increased likelihood of sustaining permanent damage. However, they allow for intricate work and precision that simply cannot be achieved by those with harder, sharper claws. As a result, this mutation has become common, as these “Softclawed” immigrate to the cities, become successful, and reproduce, and those without live in more dangerous rural areas, allowing our productivity to flourish in a safe environment."
 L83_efficient_reloading:0 "Efficient Reloading"
 L83_efficient_reloading_desc:0 "We would never claim to be the strongest warriors. Our focus on intellectual stimulation comes at the cost of neglecting our physical strength, and so our armies consist of the few who choose the lifestyle, or conscripts in times of need - not to mention the prevalence of Softclawed amongst our general populace. As such, in order to defend ourselves and stake our claim in this world, we must adapt. Firearms have become more commonplace, changing from a useful addition to one's arsenal to standard issue for entire armies. The only striking issue is the time it takes to reload one once fired, as it leaves one exposed and defenceless for up to a minute in the heat of battle. However, the same artistic precision our mutations give us could also be used in this reloading process. With some adjustments to the structure of the weapon, our long claws can be used as ramrods, and to quickly operate its machinery, allowing the firearm to be ready to fire again before the smoke even clears. These modifications may sacrifice a degree of speed and accuracy of our bullets, but are heavily made up for by our fire rate, which outclasses our opponents by wide margins."

 S53_legacy_of_the_great_migration_desc: "Unlike other Mengi kingdoms, we do not have a great and storied legacy, for our great nation is barely 3 centuries old. In 1104, a great migration out of Tanizuland came, heading north to the lands of kings and cities, a place far more prosperous than their homeland. The swamp-dwelling Sitewosi rejected the migrants, and eventually forced them away. Still, the Tanizu were not deterred, and continued onwards, eventually crossing the Yet River and settling in the lands of Layinret. Though the king of the land was welcoming at first, he sent his soldiers upon our camps, and were it not for the shifters, our ancestors would’ve met their end upon that night. We fought back, and surrounded that king’s palace, burning it to the ground. We then headed north, taking all that we saw fit, founding a kingdom of our own in the heart of Amilak’s domain, Averilibet, the kingdom of the beast marked."

We were the first to send scouts to discover and meet this angel, Kamniel, as he referred to himself. A being sent by Amilak himself to destroy the vile Yezel Mora! On the 13th of Nerament, 1444, Queen Merima II Inyaswarosa personally traveled and met the angel for herself, and on that day she pledged complete allegiance to the angel and his cause.\n\nKamniel would use the strengths of Averilibet in his great struggle against the evil swamp, with many a victory won by the crucial intervention of beast shifters.

Every Averilibeti is trained from a young age in martial arts, able to fight with or without a weapon. Our third queen, Desta Inyaswarosa, had the brilliant idea of showing off our martial abilities to others in tournaments, reminiscent of show-battles in the coliseum of far-away Fangaul.\n\nOn every important holiday we host great tournaments, inviting both Averilibeti and foreign warriors abroad to fight. Large crowds from afar gather to see great warriors, most notably our locally-famous shifters, clash against one another.\n\nWhile the payouts to the winners of these tournaments are substantial, we more than recuperate the cost at every event, bringing our kingdom a great sum of wealth throughout the year."

He started a new school of glass-making in the new village, focusing on quality and using glass as a construction material. While many at the time laughed at Singas for proposing such an idea, he sought to make it reality. While he would die before seeing his dream become a reality, his protegee managed to turn glass into a viable construction material.

It was no coincidence then that a Fuulmanan would find themselves amongst the highest ranks of Kamniel’s and later Melakmengi’s diplomatic corps, for the Fuulmana had become known by many for being the messengers or ‘voice’ of the angel."

But in the early 12th century came those beastmen, an uncouth crowd of peasants who had no regard for our culture and way of life. After our southern cousins kicked them out of the swamp, they fled north to our lands. King Harafari II, following his kind nature, welcomed the migrants, and let them set up camp in lands. A foolish mistake, for the beasts started ravaging our lands, insulting our soldiers, and most daring of all, denigrating the one God himself.\n\nOnce Harafari II learned of this, his kindness turned to fury. He ordered his army to “drive the heathens from my lands!”. Thus in the middle of the night, his army ambushed the beastmen. We hoped they would flee our lands from this. How were they supposed to know the monstrous strength these shifters had? The shifters, after slaughtering our army, marched upon our capital, razing it to the ground.\n\nIt has been centuries since that time, yet our kingdom still stands.

A prosperous city developed here, one that has been sought after by numerous kings.\n\nIn the late 1300s, Krekdekel was owned by Ketemcaka. The king of Ketemcaka at the time passed a series of edicts that angered the merchants and urbanites of Krekdekel greatly, such that they offered to swear fealty to Layinret in exchange for beneficial privileges. Layinret’s king accepted, and marched upon Krekdekel, taking the city without a fight.

The Averilibeti refused to face the Layinreti army head on, instead launching constant hit and run attacks. The entire countryside turned against Layinret, with even the bugs of the land spreading disease among Layinret’s ranks. After a year of campaigning, Layinret’s army returned home, accomplishing very little except bringing more corpses.\n\nOnly then did Averilibet’s army appear, and marched upon Layinret’s capital. The city had also mostly recovered from its razing 4 centuries prior, and now here it was facing another onslaught of shifter-warriors.

Before Layinret could fight its final stand, Kamniel himself intervened. He forced Averilibet and Layinret to negotiate an eternal peace treaty. Thus Layinret barely escaped from disaster once again, its freedom intact.\n\nBut the king of Layinret now had to start over from scratch, his capital in ruins, again. Instead of trying to rebuild for a second time, he moved his capital as far away from Averilibet. In Krekdekel would Layinret be reborn. When the king of Layinret was criticized by his advisors for doing this, he responded, “Do you want to see all that our ancestors have built be destroyed for a 3rd time? I am trying to save what remains, for I can see reality for what it is. It seems clear to me you can’t.”."

Seeking to curtail this selfish and outmoded attitude, king Mitra established the Rakraz Tartashvyth Tsarat - the Royal Thundersteel School - to properly educate his soldiers on the usage and power of firearms.

All the while it has retained its importance as the heart of Melakmengi's trade with the outside world, and Dakmender is the only place in East Sarhal to rival the cities of Rahen in size or wealth.\n\nDespite its great wealth, however, Dakmender's independence has often been tenuous, and the kingdom's finances were overleveraged during the chaos of the late 1300s slave trade. These economic woes came to a head in 1421, when the Kingdom official defaulted on its debts to powerful merchant houses in Davharral. The merchants demanded payment in property and influence, and the settling of debts resulted in increasingly direct control of Dakmender by Davharral.

To counteract this, several conventions were called by the Jadd and Lorentish diplomats, but the great mercantile interests of the region were largely unable to agree on quotas, and enforcement of such measures was never able to completely stem the overfishing. Dakmender was one of the core markets for the oyster trade during this time, city officials asking few questions despite official policy, and it once more grew rich on the pearl trade that replaced much of the city's earilier slave economy."

Centuries of skirmishes with these winged raiders, intermittent warfare with fellow Mengi, and the recent fights with Raghamideshi fleets have provided a wealth of experience in fighting against forces from land, air, and sea. Fortifications of the Kingdom of Boyebareti were thus built with defense from all directions in mind, with construction taking into account aerial countermeasures and naval invasions to ensure that no defensive position could be taken by surprise by an aerial or seaborn foe."

A major power in the coastal trade, the mercantile networks of boyebareti's rich traders are the primary mechanism through which the kingdom conducts diplomacy, using informal diplomats that range far and wide in Rahen, inner Melakmengi, and Dakinshi instead of a dedicated diplomatic core. Though unusual, the methods of the kingdom were proven during the Raheni invasion, and were responsible for rallying the other eastern Ofehibi to their cause and building the coalition that held off the mercenary armies of Sarkashabid."

The Kings of Boyebareti consolidated their lands under the auspices of protecting the lesser chiefs and kings of the region from invasion, and they are ostensibly leaders of the League of Kings. Their legitimacy derived from their ability to defend the land from foreign invasion, and while this made them vulnerable in the face of foreign aggression, it was also a far more diplomatic government reform than that of their cantankerous mengi bretheren."

With such reinforced ships they pushed back two invasions launched by Sarkashabid, but the additional weight reduced the maneuverability, and the so-called Iron Fleet could not match the numbers and speed of the Bhuvauri Republican Navy when the Slave Republic invaded in 1512, an event that would mark the beginning of the end for the independent kings of Boyebareti."

Conservative zealots, who held fast to beliefs about the importance of Vurebindika, did not appreciate being shown just how tiny their nation truly was in the context of the rest of the world.\n\nThe map was rescued from the burning building by the wealthy merchant Salik of the Diven. Salik helped fund the reconstruction of the state house, including commissioning a giant version of this map to be painted on the back wall in the central hall. The hall became the central hub through which trade negotiations, public political debates, and even cultural performances were held.

This wasn’t helped by the insulting names those on the mainland would use to refer to the Vyzemby. ‘Dog riders' and its double entendre meaning could be found scrawled on the walls in halfling districts. In an attempt to combat the racial divide, Vyzemby History Day was introduced as a national holiday to celebrate the great history of the old Vyzemby civilization and its people.\n\nFor years the holiday was mocked as a patronising joke to the people of Fahvanosy. But the efforts to teach the people of Vurebindiku about the history of the Vyzemby were ultimately successful.

The way the law was written though didn’t specify what it meant to be Khetist. It was borderline impossible for those who claimed Khetist ancestry to differentiate themselves from the local existing landowners after centuries of mixed marriages. This led to a cottage industry of forging documents claiming Khetist heritage. These “new” Khetist people were much more keen to embrace their supposed Khetist forefathers, erecting statues of Elikhet across their properties and dressing in traditional Khetist clothing.

Today the nation’s fighting force bears the legacy of those original settlers. Its soldiers are cobbled together from old generals descended from these original settlers, mixed with local warlords and their bands of followers.

That was their official position at least. In practice, they used baseless accusations of embezzlement and fraud to remove those from positions of power that the central government did not approve of.

Do this enough times and you start to get very efficient at the process. Give Khetist settlers ownership rights to new lands, integrate those who already live there, and drive out resistance. One day you could be a farmer with a small plot of land in western Sarhal, and before you even knew there was a war, a statue of Elikhet would loom over your local market and an official bearing documents would inform you that your land was being leased to you by a foreign Khetist noble."

The "Tribute Of Arms" as referred to by the governors, while unpopular among the chieftains, were followed to the letter upon pain of death.\n\nThis mobilization system, while relatively simple, helped produce vast armies of warriors from all across Fangaula, which helped the empire achieve many victories upon the field of battle."

He then headed inland, raiding and sacking the hinterlands of the 4 cities. He then returned to his capital, vowing to come back next year and conquer more.\n\nThis brief period of time was just enough for the rulers of the 4 cities to come together, forming an at-first temporary alliance.

He chose to finally conquer Manta. He gathered his great army and marched upon the city. The warriors of Manta chose to hide behind their armies and waited for the alliance. And the armies of the alliance came, and engaged Simegasa’s forces at the battle of Manta, where an unexpected attack by Manta’s warriors in the rear proved decisive. The besiegers were forced to flee, a great victory having been dealt to the Simegasan aggressors.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the kings of the cities decided to continue their alliance, forging it in blood and ink, creating the Pechuketema Pact."
 S46_the_glass_city: "The Glass City"
 S46_the_glass_city_desc: "From the earliest days of Dugiti’s existence, it has been the focal point of all Mengi glassmaking. Most glass used by the Mengi comes from Dugiti, which gives the city a firm monopoly on the material in East Sarhal. Even low quality glass requires premium prices, making it a material of prestige in Amilak’s domain. The monopoly that Dugiti has over such a desired product has led to massive amounts of wealth pouring into the city, fueling its growth far beyond what should be expected of the initially modest town."
 S46_hunred_guilds: "A Hundred Guilds"
 S46_hunred_guilds_desc: "Over the centuries, Dugiti has developed an extremely competitive environment. A hundred guilds can be found in Dugiti, all focused on perfecting the art of glass. Their competitiveness, while detrimental at times, has led to many ingenious innovations that would not have been discovered otherwise."

 S46_fire_breathers_desc: "The Dugiti were never known for their martial abilities, until 1596, when the city unleashed its new, experimental weapon upon the Trollish horde that besieged them, The weapon was a massive glass trumpet, enchanted by magic, where one blew air in and out came fire. The new weapon incinerated the horde, proving the weapon’s viability. It would not be long before the king of Pechuketema set the guilds to work, producing small, mobile fire breathers.\n\nWhile many Dugiti would take these fire breathers and become mercenaries, many more would join special “fire breather” brigades set up by Pechuketema. In battle, these specialized units would be used to intimidate and destroy the enemies’ morale, while also being useful in flushing out hidden ambushers."
 S46_the_ancient_citadel: "The Ancient Citadel"
 S46_the_ancient_citadel_desc: "Long ago, there was a long-forgotten kingdom that ruled the lands of the inland Ofehibi. A great kingdom of its time, it built many structures across the land. While few stand today, there is one remnant of that ancient kingdom in the center of Dugiti, a deep black, towering citadel. The city that bears the name “Dugiti” was built around this great citadel, after a local lord took over the abandoned structure, refurbished it, and made it his seat of power.\n\nEventually the citadel would be improved upon, and walls would be built around the settlement, yet the central structure remained crucial in Dugiti’s defense. Many times attackers would break through the walls, only to be unable to crack the ancient citadel."
 S46_brittle_subjects: "Brittle Subjects"
 S46_brittle_subjects_desc: "Every kingdom faces internal struggles for power. This problem is made worse among Mengi kingdoms, where violence and assassinations are common practice among the ruling classes. However, no Dugiti royal has ever been assassinated, a rarity in Amilak’s domain. This is due to the lords of Dugiti and their families taking up permanent residence in the ancient citadel, from which they are safe from the constant violence and bloodshed outside.\n\nFrom their position of safety, the lords of Dugiti deliberately inflame the violence between the guilds and estates, such that they are too busy killing each other to fight against the king. This gave the kings of Dugiti much leverage over those below them, which they used to centralize power over time."

And throughout this long period of its existence, the settlement has focused primarily on honing the martial strength of its warriors. Every Mantan child, no matter their sex, is trained from birth to be an excellent warrior. The training process is brutal, with weaker children often dying in the process.

Every single one of our top fighters challenged him, and all were defeated. Strangely, Shivaji had a habit of sparing those he defeated, and instead offered to train our warriors to use the special energy he harnessed, which he referred to as “Chi”.\n\nHe would move on from our city 5 years later, leaving behind a new tradition of Sarhaly chi cultivators in Manta, a tradition we practice to this day."

By some strange coincidence or as if guided by Amilak himself, every wandering warrior will find themselves in Manta at some point along their journey.\n\nIn 1461, another one of these wanderers entered our town, a humble warrior named Kajen. While he was nothing particularly special in combat, he had a keen tactical and strategic mind, such that he quickly rose through the ranks in our army. He impressed the king with his genius, and he was given the opportunity to lead an army of his own, in the upcoming campaign against the Simegasans.\n\nKajen performed brilliantly in the war, and although the campaign ended in a stalemate, he shined brightly. Kajen’s example proved to the rulers of Manta the untapped potential the wanderers had to offer, and so instituted policies designed to encourage them to join Manta’s army."

Unfortunately for the Sedarketemans, Mewomender horses were far faster than their own. Yet the Mewomender cavalry deliberately stayed within sight of their pursuers, as if they were taunting them. And soon, the Sedarketeman raiders were led into a forest, where they were ambushed by Mewomender warriors lying in wait…”\n\n-An excerpt from the book “Tales From East Sarhal”, by Jadu Uditanarayan Upendranayaran, 1756"

During this visit, a controversial abolitionist philosopher of Mengi-Raheni heritage named Jishan Sinda pressed Kamniel upon the topic of slavery. The following is an excerpt of that famous dialogue:\n\n“You claim to want to unite these lands, so that the darkness of the west will be destroyed, yet you ignore the darkness of our home? Should one not first cleanse their own body before cleaning another's? Why is it that you are so entirely focused on the vile hags, yet ignore the evils perpetuated by the kings daily?”\n\n“You misunderstand my intentions. I am purely concerned with the evil of the Yezel Mora not because it is the only evil, but because it is the most dangerous one in this world. Only with the extermination of the coven and its servants can the process of exterminating the evils of this world continue.”\n\n“Yet surely you can agree that this land is full of darkness, one that you have seemingly ignored. You have the power to end those vile institutions right now if you so chose, yet you let the slave-lords continue as they please, right in front of your eyes!”\n\n“My priority is the protection of this land, but that does not mean nothing can be done. I want to unify this land without violence and bloodshed inflicted upon its people, but that requires the cooperation of its noble kings, which forces me to look beyond…”\n\nThe angel Kamniel is said to have paused, and stuttered his words, before abruptly leaving.

For this purpose, the early residents of Tsuz converted the town center into a large forge complex. The so-called 'Forge-Tower' was a looming construct. Each floor of the tower served a different purpose, at the top ore was melted into streams that flowed down. The second floor combined these streams into a flowing bronze river. The final floor was dedicated to smithing. The complex was able to out-produce the surrounding villages many times over. Even as Tsuzik was eclipsed by the northern iron mines and the town fell into poverty, more Towers were erected. By the 15th century, most of the city lay in decaying disarray. However, the center of the city was still lit by the central Forge-Tower, staffed by the residents who remained."

At the time, Tsuz was holding the 31st Zamathanssin, and so did not involve itself with foreign conflicts. At the request of both sides, Tsuz sent a delegation of bards to negotiate peace terms.

Indeed, they saw creations as the highest form of art, a unification of the brutal history of their people and the soft expression of emotion. As the technique of Tsuzik Smithing was refined, the nature of smithing was redefined. The new art of Metalcrafting led to an explosion of unique innovations.

With this method, the smiths could mass-produce cruder tools. While the city smiths continued to balk at it as an inferior practice, melt-smithing soon became the main medium by which a soldier's weapon was made. It became integral to the Tsuzic military, as it allowed them to supply many more soldiers than their otherwise modest production capacity could allow.” - Except from “On the Sarhali Metal Craft” by Ogrin Fourthbeard."

To the common people, they are seen as great rulers, who bring peace and prosperity to their subjects.

Teleksemayi referred to the Sedarketemans as rebels, and punished them accordingly. And in 1478, when Sedarketema was finally destroyed at the battle of Denkaret, Teleksemayi made sure to make an example.

Utilizing its manpower advantage, and with support from Iyarhashar's rivals, Teleksemayi's armies marched eastwards in 1485.\n\nAt the battle of Tefgeben, the Teleksemayi and Iyarhashari armies clashed. The battle quickly turned into a stalemate, but due to a hidden flanking attack by Teleksemayi, the army of the Metobesebi emerged victorious. In the following years, the Iyarhashari would be kicked out of every holding they had on the mainland, and by 1489, they sailed away from East Sarhal, never to return.

In accordance with this policy, the state worked to destroy the old family structures and their patriarchs.

The hegemon must never be a patriarch himself, and no family should have one of their own serve as hegemon twice in a row. In turn, for the sake of the unity and stability of Sedarketema, the hegemon shall not show favoritism towards his own family.\n\nThis system led to Sedarketema having far more stable politics than other Mengi kingdoms, while at the same time avoiding the tyranny found in Sedarketema's rival.

It held for a year, long enough for our army to arrive and force the besiegers to flee.\n\nThe defense of Walagnet proved the superiority of large defensive strongpoints, instead of small wooden forts Sedarketema had been building up to this point.

Even the legendary Walagnet fell in the end, Sedarketema’s power dwindling. And with the Raheni cutting off their life line, they knew the end was near. In 1478, Sedarketema was pushed to Denkaret, the last stronghold of the free Metobesebi. Every available man, old or young, gathered in a suicide army of 8,000. The king of Teleksemayi had arrived with his much larger host, prepared to exterminate the defenders and their families to the last.\n\nThe final army of Sedarketema hid behind their final hillfort, prepared to fight to the end. They fought on the walls, they fought in the courtyard, they fought in the keep, they fought in the watchtowers, they fought in the barracks. They never surrendered. They were eradicated.\n\nThe cost Teleksemayi paid was enormous, as the Sedarketemans killed 2 men for every 1 they lost. And while Teleksemayi entered the battle with 20,000, it left Denkaret with only half still standing. The defenders, exterminated to the last, became martyrs. They along with Sedarketema itself became symbols to future Metobesebi on the better path their people could have taken, rather than the tyrannical Teleksemayi."

Surviving in squalor conditions, these refugees started off as simple foragers. However this simplicity of survival bloomed into academic intrigue. Foraging has led them to discover which food is edible and farmable, but it granted an advantage to survive longer in this shady wasteland. Soon these scholars soon found themselves in an unusual alliance of hunters, Deathsworn, and shamans, becoming the faction of the “Swamp Wardenship.” Swamp-Wardens became experts of the terrain with a scientific understanding of the Swamps.\n\nBy 1444, The Swamp-Wardens currently rule Yemotafari. Ruling with a fair meritocratic system of governance. So far, they have returned the egalitarian status quo lost during the “Great Shame.” Despite this, their actions during and after Tamrat’s fall are still seen with contention with some, even those who disapproved of the tyrant’s actions disliked their method.

Riots were frequent and quashed brutally. Our poor treatment of the lands cost our Tanizu allies, as Kidsit Yitsi added salt to our wounds by isolating us and leaving us open to a counter-attack. Their invasion was quick and furious, and our tribe was close to collapse.

It was an exhausting effort, the Scribes sifted through hundreds of studies, some contradictory, some outdated, some right and wrong, a few completely gone or completely incoherent and had to be rewritten. But by 1449, the “Index of Kadmuduuk” was completed, and was an immediate source of importance to the Wardenship, enforcing the text on newer recruits.

 S58_spreading_the_fire_desc: "For generations the kings of Werikgeta cultivated an order of spies, personally loyal only to the monarch himself. This order of spies dutifully carried out every order of their sovereign, no matter how heinous it may be. The agents of Werikgeta were responsible in aiding the renegade king of Enikmesiki in his fight against Shelokmengi, in the splitting of Meretgeban, and the general spread of utter chaos across the Yet River Valley."

 S58_enslaved_axemen_desc: "The kings of Werikgeta only trusted those that were personally loyal to or dependent upon them. Such was their paranoia that they disregarded the conscript armies so common in other Mengi kingdoms. Instead, Werikgeta bought masses of young male slaves to be turned into soldiers. The enslaved axemen of Werikgeta trained their entire lives to fight in battle, a standing army superior to the mass conscripts they usually fought. The axemen held a high position in Werikgetan society, for they can do as they pleased, bowing to none except their owner. They were untouchable, as to insult a Werikgetan axeman was to insult the king."

 S58_the_archetypical_mengi_king_desc: "After crashing down upon Halann and meeting with the queen of Averilibet, Kamniel traveled south, seeking to meet the rulers of the lands of the Yet River Valley. The first city he came to, Weriksedar, happened to be the capital of Werikgeta. Kamniel flew into the golden palace, bypassing any guard that even tried to stop him.\n\nKamniel came face to face with Behishan II, the king of Werikgeta, in his throne room. Behishan quickly realized that he was facing a divine being, and so placated the angel as much as he could, trying to give a good impression. But for as much as he tried, the king would be embarrassed constantly, for every lie he told was immediately detected by the holy being, who directly addressed Behishan for this. Once Kamniel realized the king Weikgeta would only tell him lies and was only interested in placating him, Kamniel left as swiftly as he came, never to return.\n\nIt seems Kamniel had learned from this experience, for he never again truly trusted the gold lord and his kingdom."

 S58_a_spy_in_every_camp_desc: "The spies of Werikgeta were found in every court, every fort, every camp, and every town across the Yet. Every move made by every monarch was known almost immediately by the Werikgetan king, allowing the gold lords to respond quickly to any action by their rivals. It was this massive spy network that led to Werikgeta’s rise to power, and it will be crucial to Werikgeta’s future successes."

 S58_city_of_suspicion_desc: "“North of Shelokmengi lies the domain of the gold lords, Werikgeta. I had heard it was a kingdom of gold, of wealth, and of power. I wished to see this for myself, and so traveled to Weriksedar, the golden seat. The city sat atop a large hill near the western edge of the kingdom, looking down at the plains below. As I was visibly not of these lands, the guards at the city's gates at first didn’t let me through, and only with the help of a native companion of mine was I allowed in.\n\nThe city was just as I had imagined it to be, visibly very wealthy. Although, this place seemed extremely different in both customs and appearance to my homeland of Qasri Aqoon. As I walked its streets and markets, I had an unnerving feeling I was being watched, as if my every movement was being recorded. And out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow move, which frightened me greatly. The citizens too seemed to watch my every move.\n\nWhen the day turned to twilight, I had decided to leave, for I had realized the truth about this place. I had heard rumors before of Werikgeta operating a vast network of shadowmen, who followed the king's orders alone. Clearly, by entering Werikgeta, as foreign as I appeared, I unintentionally had caught the eye of these spies, who now watched my every move. This city of suspicion is not for someone like me, who prefers a peace of mind, so I left. I would travel throughout the night, returning back to the pleasant fields of Shelokmengi…”\n\n-”A Journey Across Sarhal” Nakhar Salow, 1453"

 S58_alliances_of_convenience_desc: "Through subterfuge and luck, Werikgeta was crucial in the weakening of its rivals, being secretly responsible for the establishment of Wezingoa and Enikmesiki. These two kingdoms are tied at the hip to Werikgeta, and depend upon the gold lords for survival against Meretgeban and Shelokmengi. In true Werikgetan fashion, however, the lord of gold refused to aid Enikmesiki and Wezingoa in any offensive against their rivals, keeping the two kingdoms as mere pawns."
 S58_crashing_down: "Crashing Down"
 S58_crashing_down_desc: "The last lord of Werikgeta, Behishan II, ascended to the throne at age 16. He continued upon his fathers’ successes, and led to Werikgeta becoming the most powerful of the Yet River kingdoms. Yet he was unable to prevent the establishment of an alliance formed against Werikgeta, leading to three decades of an uneasy stare down across the Yet River Valley. Being unable to produce an heir of his own, Behishan II was forced to choose from a number of distant relatives to be his heir. Tragically, every successor he chose died from disease or accidents. Upon Behishan’s death in 1472, there was no Werikgetan heir, with the court and the slave army split upon two relatives to become the new ruler. Behishan’s body had not even become cold before the bloodshed and the bitter civil war began.\n\nSeeing a golden opportunity, the alliance of Shelokmengi, Meretgeban, and Fetengoni moved against Werikgeta and its allies. Both potential heirs of Werikgeta would die in battle fighting the alliance, with Meretgeban’s armies famously sacking the Golden Palace of Werikgeta. Werikgeta was partitioned between Shelokmengi and Meretgeban; never again would the lords of gold dominate the region as they once had."

 S60_a_land_of_markets_desc: "In many Mengi kingdoms, the lesser-kings rule with impunity, only having to pay vassalage to the king himself. This is not so in Meretgeban, a land where the merchant clans have grown to be extremely powerful, able to contend not just with the nobility, but even the king. These merchant clans made their wealth primarily from the slave trade, but have diversified their incomes, wielding their influence far beyond Meretgeban’s borders. These merchant clans even started imitating the market processions of the Mengi kings, displaying all the power and wealth they had."
 S60_from_merchant_to_king: "From Merchant To King"
 S60_from_merchant_to_king_desc: "The Abdi clan that now rules Meretgeban was once not even of noble rank, merely a family of extremely wealthy commoners. While they had as much or even more material power than the nobles, they and their merchant peers were not afforded the same amount of respect. This led to much internal tension as the mages and nobles opposed the merchants on nearly every issue. This was the status quo in the kingdom for generations, as the royal family was forced to balance the two factions, lest their kingdom fall apart.\n\nIn the 1420s, Aberash III ascended the throne of Meretgeban. The new king was a powerful mage in his own right, following in the tradition of Azmera the Unbreakable. The rise of a mage of such caliber to the throne of Meretgeban angered the merchant clans severely. The wealthy clans raised one of their own, Amadi of the Abdi clan, to become the new king, starting a civil war.\n\nThe conflict was bloody, but in the end the merchants proved victorious, forcing the royal faction to flee upstream to Wezinmesig. The new royals, the ije Abdi-Amadi, relied heavily upon the merchants to exert power, and it is with the merchants that the new Meretgeban was born."
 S60_aiding_the_angel: "Aiding The Angel"
 S60_aiding_the_angel_desc: "Meretgeban was one of the first Mengi kingdoms to offer unconditional support to Kamniel’s cause. And while the actual manpower Meretgeban offered was comparably light, the funds and supplies needed to keep an army functioning year round certainly was not. Much of the food, equipment, and money Kamniel’s army needed to function came from Meretgeban, at the kingdom's own personal expense, and with no expectation of a reward.\n\nTo the other kings of the region, what Meretgeban was doing was both honorable and crazy, especially for a merchant dominated kingdom such as this. But as far as the merchants of Meretgeban where concerned, destroying the hags and the trolls would reap long term gains over the short term losses they suffered."

 S60_the_council_of_111_desc: "The monarchs of the ije Abdi-Amadi proved far weaker than the royal house that came before. It was not long before the merchants forced Jadiku I in 1464 to establish a great council, in which the patriarchs of every merchant clan had a seat. This council, which became known as the council of one-one-one, had the sole legal right to raise taxes in the kingdom. This body would only grow in power over time, forcing the king to make concession-after-concession, until by the 1500s the king was a mere figurehead, all real power being vested in the council, which many historians consider the first Mengi parliament."
 S60_the_cannons_of_calib: "Cannons Of Calib"
 S60_the_cannons_of_calib_desc: "Many Mengi are distrustful of innovations not of Amilak’s land. We are different, for the world beyond the seas are full of wonderful inventions, especially of a military nature. How great was it when foreign ships sailed into our river harbor, carrying a black tube filled with an explosive powder that fired large stones at great distances. This incredible weapon was soon bought from the foreign ship at an exorbitant price, but the weapon itself was worth it. We set our engineers to work to replicate it, and then had our artisans build these “cannons” for our armies.\n\nThese cannons were put into practice in our armies under general Calib ije Nahum, who created the first Meretgeban artillery corps. It was the cannons under his direction that won Meretgeban many a victory. Calib would later write down his tactics involving cannons, passing his texts over to our officers. To this day every Meretgeban general studies Calib’s work in detail, ensuring our dominance in artillery warfare in East Sarhal."

 S60_revenge_upon_the_gold_lords_desc: "In 1472 the king of Werikgeta, Meretgeban’s main rival, finally met his end, without an official heir to succeed him. Immediately the kingdom fell into a succession war. Meretgeban and Shelokmengi immediately saw their chance, and invaded their common enemy.\n\nMeretgeban marched upon Weriksedar, the golden seat of the kings of Werikgeta. The defenders put up a fierce resistance, but after a month the defenses broke, and Meretgeban’s army swarmed into the city.\n\nThe following sack of Weriksedar was brutal, even by Mengi standards. As soldiers broke into the royal palace, the last surviving claimant to the throne, along with his family, were captured. As for the common citizens, Meretgeban’s commanders decreed that every Werikgetan commoner should be killed on sight, the women and children too. Meretgeban set an example that day, one that the enemies of Meretgeban never forgot."

In 1481, the council of 111 issued a new law that called for the integration of mages into the army. These mages would become officers, firmly integrated into the command structure. Every regiment had a mage, whose job was to create and maintain a strong ward around their local unit. These wards protected the kingdom’s armies from arrow and cannonfire in battle, and proved critical in any retreat Meretgeban’s armies may be forced to undertake."

It is here where the most powerful wizards of East Sarhal can be found, and where the latest and greatest magic minds share their knowledge. These mages, while predominantly of the scholarly type, are still remarkable in their abilities if they can be coaxed out in their academic pursuits.

 S59_on_the_backfoot_desc: "Once, the kings of the ije Birra-Bonsa ruled Meretgeban. They enjoyed the benefits of a great and wealthy kingdom, a power of the lower Yet. The kingdom was plagued with a great factional rivalry, between the mages and nobles on one side, and the wealthy merchant clans on the other. The kings sought to keep the two factions in balance, but it would eventually break at some point. And it came in the 1420s, when king Aberash III, the true and only legitimate king of Meretgeban, came to power. The merchant clans, angered, rose a wealthy commoner to the position of king, tearing Meretgeban apart in bloody strife.\n\nEventually, the legitimate side was forced to flee to Wezinmesig, the corrupt merchants now having a puppet in Meretgeban. Although Aberash III and his allies had lost the battle, they were not out of the fight, and bid his time, waiting for the perfect chance to march southwards and retake his rightful throne."
 S59_azmera_the_unbreakable: "Azmera The Unbreakable"
 S59_azmera_the_unbreakable_desc: "In the 1200s, a young mage in his 20s named Azmera left Meretgeban, traveling upstream to build a mage tower for himself. In this tower he researched and improved upon his magic, becoming the foremost expert in abjuration and transmutation magic in East Sarhal. In time, a settlement grew around his tower, as his feats became famous across Amilak's land. This settlement prospered even after Azmera's demise, becoming known as Wezinmesig, the river tower.\n\nWhile Azmera accomplished many legendary feats in his day, there is one that stands above the rest in its usefulness. He invented a method by which cloth can easily be abjurated, becoming as hard as metal, negating the need for heavy iron armor. This abjurated cloth would quickly become mass produced in Wezinmesig, as the method was refined so that even apprentice mages could do it.\n\nWhile the method would spread to other cities over time, only in Wezinmesig is the highest quality warded fabrics produced, made exclusively for our soldiers to use in battle."
 S59_tempering_our_ambitions: "Tempering Our Ambitions"
 S59_tempering_our_ambitions_desc: "Unfortunately, the day where Aberash III’s armies marched to Meretgeban never came, at least in the short term. What was assumed to be a tactical retreat turned into a long exile. The old order of Meretgeban was forced to build an entirely new kingdom of Wezinmesig, a kingdom known as Wezingoa. This new kingdom still claimed to be the rightful rulers of Meretgeban, yet in daily life the reality was clear. This was a new kingdom now, heavily influenced by the mages of its capital. Consequently, Aberash tempered his ambitions, focusing less on returning to Meretgeban, and more on patronizing the research into magic itself."
 S59_studying_the_divine: "Studying The Divine"
 S59_studying_the_divine_desc: "The appearance of a divine being on Halann named Kamniel presented an extremely rare opportunity to the mages and scholars of Wezinmesig. In 1459, Kamniel came to the city to meet with its king. During this visit, the angel let the mages and scholars perform numerous tests and interviews with him. The information gained from this was invaluable, and gave a rare glimpse into the world of the divine.\n\nWhat they found was this: angels are made of pure light, they do not bleed, light emerges from any wound they receive, they have their own emotions and feelings, they are fundamentally good beings, but their morality is strange to mortals. The information gained from Wezingoa, along with the later discoveries by the Ravelians centuries later, would form the foundation of understanding of celestials as a whole."

 S59_fetenilibet_system_desc: "“The mages are a blessing for us, and without them we surely would have fallen to Meretgeban by now, so why not reward them?”\n\nThis was the reasoning Aberash III gave in 1443, when he instituted the Fetenilibet system. This system rewarded mages that did great deeds for the state, where they would be elevated to the rank of nobility. This made the mages more loyal to us, and more importantly, much more willing to work hard for our interests."

 S59_the_treaty_of_kwariketem_desc: "Werikgeta had aided Wezingoa greatly, guaranteeing its independence from their adversaries in Meretgeban. But with Werikgeta’s destruction in 1472, it was clear that Wezingoa’s time had finally come. The old king, Aberash III, and his advisors, hatched a daring plan, made specifically for a scenario such as this. They would negotiate with Meretgeban before their armies arrived, and call upon Kamniel to aid them.\n\nWith the divine being on Wezingoa’s side, the old king negotiated the best deal he possibly could have gotten, where Wezingoa would be peacefully annexed into Meretgeban, but with no retribution being taken against the mages, the lesser-kings, or anyone else. Crucially, the ije Birra-Bonsa would remain untouched, only having to give up their claim to the throne of Meretgeban permanently.\n\nThus the Treaty of Kwariketem was signed, finally re-unifying the old kingdom of Meretgeban. Aberash and his family would then retire to the countryside, becoming a prominent clan of mages in the centuries to come."

As such we employ well-made bronze shields reinforced with hardened wood, which we align in tight formations, skillfully holding off any charges from the tribal kings of the jungle. “The Woodchopper Kings” was a nickname given to the ije Devhane-Owe dynasty due to the Glenslaughter, a battle in which a Sitewosi army ambushed King Tesfaye I ije Devhane-Owe at an inspection of a recently initiated jungle clearing, where he and his royal guard had joined in at cutting trees as a symbol of support to the foresters. At first, the King’s soldiers were driven back as they attempted to get to their armour and weapons unable to form their tight ranks without their shields, but Tesfaye I rallied the woodcutters to fight, cutting at limbs as sure and swiftly as they did at branches. The Sitewosi were halted and the royal guard swept in to corral their disheartened warriors, chasing them into the newly made clearings and skewering them on their long spears. Since then a portion of the King’s guard is chosen among the woodcutters and armed with axes on top of the usual spear.

An issue with this was the Sitewosi, while they paid tribute quite willingly once subjugated the issue was that their kingdoms were not long-lived. Every decade a few new tribal kings would topple the old loyal ones to raid the borders of the Great Kingdom once more. Though this was lessened by the establishment of true Sitewosi vassal kingdoms in the area it became clear to Owe III that he must use a firmer hand with the jungle. For this cause, the Kingdom of Ketemcaka was founded, the city of Ketemcakan was granted to Taridas, a lesser king from Zusedar and all the kings and lesser kings of Great Fetengoni, as well as all the tributary kings of Owe III were invited to the city to witness Taridas I ije Devhane-Owe’s crowning. Despite the propping up of a lesser king to king being rather untraditional the prestige of Great Fetengoni and the presence and approval of so many Kings at his coronation made Taridas’s dynasty one of the most legitimate of the Mengi respected even among the great house of the Yeteferen."

They raid our farms to steal grain and cattle, and they sack villages and towns, even pillaging the temples of The One True God despite claiming to be His followers. It is no wonder why the kings of Ketemcaka keep a well-manned guard around them at all times, as on multiple occasions ambushes come upon them from the jungle sometimes even from our own Sitewosi subjects. \n\nOnce we tried to include Sitewosi in our army as the kings of Ibekisedara proudly do, this practice lead to chaos among our troops as the wild unscrupulousness of the tribesmen wore at the discipline of our ranks. While an inefficient and unpopular policy it was still maintained in the faith that the savages through Amilak’s light would eventually civilise. This foolish dream of trust came to an end with the assassination of Taridas II by a presumed honourable Sitewosi of his own royal guard. While our neighbours consider them honourable fellow residents of the Holy Land we know better, even the most respectable seeming or kind Sitewosi hides a dagger behind his back, the only Mengi we can trust to fight for our king is a Yeteferen!"

As such we developed a method through the use of fire, while considered dangerous by some, and a waste of wood by others this simply couldn’t be further from the truth. The method is simple in theory: we cut down the trees around an area, creating a border to what forest we wish to burn and keeping the fire from spreading out of control, when it is burned regular patrols keep watch over the borders to ensure the fire is contained. For additional safety, burnings are forbidden except in the month before the end of the dry season and the start of the wet, so even if a mistake is made and the fire leaps across its boundary the rains are not too far away to quench it before it can do too much damage. With this method we rapidly expand our farmlands more and more, one day we shall produce more grain than the fields of Shelokmengi itself."

Over time, however, it became clear this was making us unprepared and short-sighted, a prime target for Sitewosi raiders. Thus Taridas I concluded his army must learn the ways of the jungle to make sure no Sitewosi could unwittingly cross our borders. While the Sitewosi were still trusted it was they who taught jungle warfare and logistics to the soldiers, their banishment from the military did not mean the banishment of the tactics and survival skills they shared with us, and it is no surprise that when such logistics skills are incorporated into an actually well-coordinated army they end up being much more potent than in a tribal rabble."

Lightened by wax candles hanging from vast beams, debating furiously in the scent of plundered Yeteferen incense floating in wisps through the fresh breeze one could find most of the lesser kings of Bosonkikon, along with any of the Dread Fang’s off duty generals. Lishan II fostered a culture of discussion between the healing soldiers and the resident lesser kings, the accounts of battle would be brought to the ears of these eager minds, and gaps in Bosonkikon’s strategy are quickly  healed just as the holes in our soldiers."

As in any deal, any relationship, there is a give and take, a compromise: over the centuries this softer, more harmonising manipulation of the trees gave birth to the Palewood, with thick trunks and windy branches with large round green leaves these trees hide behind their plain bark a wood of purest white. Treasure to us of Bosonkikon, and a sign of Amilak’s favour in tending the forest this wood is rare and used only in the most important construction, reserved in most cases to be carved into ornaments to be traded abroad or kept as heirlooms. It is said the Palewood grows only on the land of a most pious king or lesser king, and truly pious is the man who can afford a house of them, for wonderful as they are few have ever been built."

The King of Saposakosa accepted the offer, taking the name Himmedas I ije Umat-Defen, meaning “son of the Prosperous” and with support from the armies of Ibekisedara we forged a powerful nation in the eastern jungle.

The streets and palaces have been left to crumble, in order that we maintain the integrity of the high walls.

It is clear that the ambition of the Bosonkikoni king to oust Yeteferen influence will bring him to us next. Though we are no strangers to such conflicts, our wise king Aante II, to be ready for the ‘Upstarts’, mandated an expansion of the militia system in 1445.

However, their approach was one of passivity: they stood guard over the treasures and remains of the demi-lich Kaino, protecting them for centuries, but doing nothing to correct the world around them.\n\nNow, they realise that they can do more to oppose necromancers as well as others that misuse magic. The Adaru sentinels have integrated into our ranks to form an elite unit of ‘Lich Hunters’, specialised in combating spellcasters.

Among their ranks have emerged some who have taken to referring to themselves and our people as the Banni. They argue that by ending such a terrible evil as the Second Fangaulan Empire, Banni redeemed our people of our ancestors’ sins. Now, they say, we should discard the name Kaino and take up the name of Banni as a name we can wear with pride.\n\nWhile this movement is still young, these motivated loyalists nonetheless go about espousing the accomplishments of our people, leaving a different impression of us in the minds of others."

In addition to the tales and fables conveying morals and values, they began telling of the Kaino’s past and present.

Experts in Kaino poetry, they would create poems for each child to convey their insights to them.

 B69_grey_grey_mist_of_home_desc:0 "Over rolling hills and across meandering streams, an ever-present grey mist shrouds Crovania. In other lands, this would be considered an omen or warning, but for us, it is a simple fact of life. Farmers toil and merchants haggle, unbothered by the blurred horizons and dappled light during daytime. At night, a common saying in Crovania holds that hard workers “sleep in the mist's embrace” - peacefully and without a care. Why worry about anything beyond your own field if you can't see it in the first place?\n\nMany who visit Crovania are unsettled by the mist and leave as quickly as they arrive. They spread rumours of ghostly figures hidden in the gloom and scoff at our simple lifestyles, discouraging many a traveller. This suits us just fine. Each mist-wreathed village and town is a placid land of hardy folk, left mostly untouched by the squabbles of greater Cannor. Where other holdings suffer under tyrannical nobles, we enjoy a great degree of autonomy and freedom. The nobles enjoy passing their time around the village and participating in chat and parties with commoners. In Crovania, everyone is cut from the same misty cloth. Some may call our lands strange and steer away from the fog. For us, though, it's home."

The classic symbol of the Crovanian peoples is that of Adean’s hand holding a spear.\n\nCrovan Spearsworn was the first to bring the worship of Adean not only to Crovania but to Lencenor as a whole. The ancient Crovanni people followed his lead, and with Adean guiding Crovan, they were able to find a safe land and establish a secure community in Crovan’s Rest. Thus, the origins of an Adeanic Crovania came forth, and the people have had an affinity for the god ever since. The people are generous and kind, and the nobles are honourable and clean of corruption, working day and night to prosper. These are lessons ingrained in the Crovanians from the day they were born until now, all thanks to Adean."

When they fought alongside the Moon Party during the Lilac Wars, though, they proved their worth. As opposing Silmuna-aligned and Lorentish armies met in battle, the Crovanians became a necessary component to fight off the Lorentish coalition. A disciplined and unwavering force in a sea of crashing waves.\n\nThe reason for such valiance is the same reason the Crovanians stayed humble: Adean. By fighting in battle with all they could, the men of Crovania believed that they would be blessed by their patron and could live their lives happily.\n\nThus, the morale of the Crovanians remained high all throughout the war. They fought in the battles of Kyliande and Greatfield, and eventually witnessed the Derannic surrender in Rosereach in 1439. Deprived of allies, the Crovanians strained themselves to stand as firm as they could. They would cry their final hurrah as their armies were wiped out in the battle of Crovan’s Rest. By 1440, the Crovanians would surrender to their fate, and they would be annexed by the Lorentish crown."

For centuries, nobody has dared venture into the cursed fog. Rumours abound of monsters and eldritch beings that lurk around the coast, that grab onto people and then drag them to the depths of the waters to feast. The fact that the mist became so thick sometimes that it was impossible to see a lighthouse; these tales don’t tempt explorers to venture around these waters when there are far more interesting things to explore.\n\nThe Crovanians thus had the Shrouded Coast all for themselves. They enjoyed full control of this seaway, as it allowed the few Crovanian traders that existed to outcompete their competition in Lorent and Sorncóst, even with their tiny numbers. Their willingness to explore and memorise the Shrouded Coast gave them navigational knowledge like no other.\n\nThe Crovanian traders banded together to form the Crovanian Trade Company, which dominated trade around the Shrouded Coast and transported goods no matter the dangers. This pioneer spirit led to them expanding to the far reaches of the Dalaire, transporting goods to and from Aelantir."

After the death of Triandil Medrontis with no suitable replacement from House Medrontis, his close friend Belan was given regency over New Adea until a suitable replacement from House Medrontis could be found.\n\nUnfortunately for Belan, the old lady Griselda, mother of Triandil and ruler of nearby Mistspear, heard a different story. As a young mage, she studied all the magics profusely, believing that they had spoken to her. While it may have just been a gut instinct at first, in her old age she truly acted as if the magics were alive and talking. In her slumber, she heard voices screaming cries of assassination.\n\nEventually, Griselda invited her young nephew Drunhem, Belan and the rest of House Medrontis to a meeting. Nothing seemed different from any of the previous occasions on which House Medrontis had convened. It was one of Griselda’s nieces who noticed she was noticeably different that evening. Her face was tired; her eyes were bloodshot, and her pupils in a blur. As the family gathered around the dinner table, Griselda stood to give a toast for the wonderful evening. She talked for what seemed like an age until, abruptly, she stopped. A tear came to her eye as she spoke of her son and his brutal assassination. Nobody knew what she was talking about, as Drunhem and Belan sat watching in fearful paralysis. Griselda continued, her voice becoming hoarse and her tears flowing. She shouted and screamed until finally she turned and yelled:\n\n“You Belan, you took my son from me! He is dead because of your greed! My own nephew, Drunhem, helped him! And all of you did as well! You are all pigs and devils and demons! You will all be damned!”\n\nThe night was still young, as Medron Hall went dark.

The fields were unproductive, and the people were poor.\n\nThis was true until the elves would come to settle in Crovanian territory. They saw the calm lands and immediately brought their peoples in caravans to settle along the Shrouded Coast. Many were surprised at the vast number of elves travelling to settle in their isolated fields. The Crovanians were intrigued by the incoming elves and their culture. They treated their new neighbours as friends and provided them with food and new homes. It took very little time for the elves and Crovanians to mix into one.\n\n Whilst well-appreciated by the Crovanians, the most notable thing they brought wasn’t their culture or their wealth; it was their silk. Shops appeared across Crovan’s Rest, and eventually even large-scale companies. Crovania would become notorious for its elven silk, which gave it a soft feel unlike any other. Thus, Crovan’s Rest became a valuable hub for the silk market, and Crovania soon became invaluable to their wine-loving brethren."

What was the need if they were so distant from conflict?\n\nYet, as the lands grew older and old rocks eroded, an opportunity came about. An iron mine was found in Mistspear, and nearby, a copper mine.\n\nThus, the era of the Crovanian Cannons began, as high-quality cannons were shipped out locally and regionally. Mistspear, which had once been a backwater, suddenly got rid of its run-down infrastructure and prospered from the new income surrounding the mining and forging community and the production of their cannons. They were known for their firing power, which allowed them to reach long distances with ease.\n\nAll of this gave the Crovanians a new outlet for their tiny local guard, the Lorentish major army, and any other possible buyers. Their few numbers could now be happy, economically and militarily secured by high-quality Crovanian cannons."

Whether it be animal or humanoid, the spear of any of the lizardfolk in our tribe are equal to the warriors of more city-inclined states. Where they have one warrior, we have ten."
 lizardfolk_tangle_of_snakes: "Tangle of Snakes"
 lizardfolk_tangle_of_snakes_desc: "They say the true danger of a tangle of snakes is that it becomes impossible to differentiate one from another, or the venomous ones from the not. Lizardfolk diplomacy is a similar situation among the tribes and cities. What may be a greeting to one could be an insult to another, what may seem like a kind gesture, could bring about war and death. Thousands of years of history have left every tribe connected in some form or other, insult one and you’re likely to garner the support of a dozen and the anger of a dozen more. For this, us tribes have a tendency to keep our minds open and our connections too."
 lizardfolk_cycle_of_empires: "Cycle of Empires"
 lizardfolk_cycle_of_empires_desc: "We may be tribes, but we are no strangers to empires. Since the beginning of our history there have been 332 empires, each one proclaiming itself to be the grandest there has ever been. We of the tribes merely laugh and wait, for in due time these empires will fall too. Whether it’s a decade, a century, or even longer, they will not last. Even then, the cycle must come to an end eventually, the prophecy will be fulfilled."
 lizardfolk_legacy_of_anzara_empire: "Legacy Of The Anzara Empire"
 lizardfolk_legacy_of_anzara_empire_desc: "The greatest part of the Anzara empire, the 332nd, has been its fall! We tribes have remained for the most part unaffected, but with the fall of the 332nd comes the chance for the 333rd. Though we were united under this past empire, it was merely the penultimate. The 333rd is prophesied to be the final empire, the one that will unite all lizardfolk under its banner for the rest of time."
 lizardfolk_use_everything: "Lizardfolk Use Everything"
 lizardfolk_use_everything_desc: "From the hide of a beast to the most minute bone, we Lizardfolk are known to find a use for each aspect of our crafts. Each failed ceramic can be repurposed and even a broken bowstring has a purpose. In the harsh jungles we waste not, for there is much to want."
 lizardfolk_times_change_warriors_do_not: "Times Change, Warriors Do Not"
 lizardfolk_times_change_warriors_do_not_desc: "So came the Cannorians with their guns, and so came the Halessi with their martial arts, and so came the Aelantiri with their strange magics, each one a new tactic and weapon to our way of life. No matter how these cultures may try though, they will not and can not force their ways on us. Whatever we choose to adopt we will, and whatever we decide to reject best not show itself to us again! People come and times change but our faithful warriors do not."

 F63_battlemages_junta: "Battlemages Junta"
 F63_battlemages_junta_desc: "Aramoole is one of the primary examples of that form of governance that is increasingly referred to as a 'battlemage stratocracy'—martial rule by mages. It is magical-martial potential that determines the merit of a person in the eyes of the Aramoole state. For, to remain strong, the state cannot tolerate hereditary governance by inbred fools or the election of leaders from a choice of money-grubbing buffoons. It is only through a constant generational renewal of new mages that Aramoole can maintain its integrity and magical might."
 F63_raising_a_battlemage: "Raising A Battlemage"
 F63_raising_a_battlemage_desc: "It matters not if a child within our borders was born a noble or a slave—if they show magical potential, the Aramoole state will take them to be raised into an elite battlemage. However, every child is different, each requiring a unique approach. As a result our battlemages are trained differently; they each have different magical affinities, different weapons preferences, different tactics and strategy on the battlefield. But the outcome is always the same: a battlemage of Aramoole is, without fail, a deadly, disciplined, and powerful warrior."
 F63_militarized_capital: "Militarized Capital"
 F63_militarized_capital_desc: "Without a capital, a nation is nothing—without Aramoole itself our state is nothing but a historical footnote. It is not enough for us to have some castle walls and a garrison—the whole capital of our nation must be militarised. We will construct barracks, forts, academies, training grounds, equipment workshops, and mage towers—and post guards everywhere and maintain dragonne packs wherever appropriate. In this manner, we will preside over an era of military strength, with a healthy dose of technological advancement  for good measure."
 F63_tijarikheti_attatan: "Tijarikheti Attatan"
 F63_tijarikheti_attatan_desc: "We Tijarikhetis have many noodle dishes, which we tend to refer to as 'attatan' or 'attahan'. However, the average foreigner generalises all attatan to one specific dish, which tends to make all of them, no matter where they come from, drool. Small, tub-shaped sorghum noodles, a sauce composed of sheep or cow's milk, salted goat or—more rarely—buffalo cheese, and butter. Such is the popularity of this combination, that our battlemages have jokingly complained the dish’s reputation outshines even their own! It gets even better with the addition of a local mushroom, which we call 'gnoll's fur', or shredded chicken meat."
 F63_a_bronze_eye_watching: "A Bronze Eye Watching"
 F63_a_bronze_eye_watching_desc: "Our suspicious enemies, trying to avoid taking responsibility for their blunders, claim that a bronze eye is watching us in Aramoole. Whenever it seems like we are going to lose, we manage to win. Time and again we pull victory from the jaws of defeat. We pull off ambushes of a sort that no one but a great talent of history would normally achieve. The rumor began with enemy reports of a large, scaled beast being seen behind smoke and shadow, there at every important moment. Perhaps these people are in the right, but perhaps not—regardless of the truth behind the rumours, we will march forward to conquer Tijarikhet and the East."
 F63_great_cannons: "Great Cannons"
 F63_great_cannons_desc: "Years ago, our great ruler Aakhet sent emissaries out throughout the then-known world to bring back samples of artillery. When the emissaries returned, Aakhet worked with them to build the beginnings of our legendary artillery corps. Though later on after Aakhet's departure our artillery corps suffered, we are now in a position to revive it and expand its scale beyond anything Aakhet himself could have dreamt of. This being done, we will be able to ensure that everyone trembles before the sight, sound, and strength of our cannons once again."
 F63_reforge_aakhets_empire: "Reforge Aakhet's Empire"
 F63_reforge_aakhets_empire_desc: "Tijarikhet is now unified; the most immediate enemies of Aramoole are defeated; we have at last begun to do honour to our august ruler's memory. But it is not enough. We must head north, seize the Mandate of the Khet, then push to the East until there is no more east left to push into. In this manner, Aakhet's name and Aramoole's glory will be engraved upon the minds of all races on Halann!"

 L08_peace_between_houses_desc: "When Kheterata ruled over Horashesh, they split our homeland into Medasi - regions to be ruled over by a Kheteratan governor working in tandem with a local monarch. Other Medasi have descended into petty conflicts, fighting each other for influence until the quaggas come home and the sun falls out of the sky. Kulugiash has historically been more prudent. Both Kheteratans and the native houses of Kulugiash knew the merits of coming together to obtain goals. While others bleed each other white, we put aside our differences and preserved peace between houses. It would take something extraordinary to break this harmony between our people…"
 L08_the_quagga: "The Quagga"
 L08_the_quagga_desc: "In our lands there exists a breed of horse called the quagga. Carefully raised and bred by mages, it is the absolute pinnacle of its species, unmatched in bravery and unparalleled in its stoicism. Unlike weaker horses, or other equines such as the zebra and the wild ass, the quagga can survive any and all harsh conditions it faces — even to its own detriment if the rumours are to be believed."
 L08_our_men_for_our_own: "Our Men For Our Own"
 L08_our_men_for_our_own_desc: "Kheterata would in days past rely on Kulugiash, our homeland, for its auxiliaries and elite soldiers. They plucked our finest generals to serve their own goals. When Kheterata suffered from a crisis, Kulugiash would suffer too, being bled dry of its men for the sake of the Kingdom. But that time is past. Kheterata has lost her grip over us and our armed forces shall serve for our purposes alone."

 L08_religion_desc: "We are the heartland of the Cult of Ikhanilawuli — a great ruler of ages long past, known above all else for training respected diplomats and leaving an example of discipline that a thousand generations would tell their children to imitate. Though dominions may rise and fall and powers appear and disappear, the greatness of Ikhanilawuli shines forth like a torch against the unrestrained folly that surrounds us. We will not forsake our great deity — never!"
 L08_pastorialists: "Kudemtu Pastures"

With their burdens borne on backs strengthened by centuries of honest labour, and with methods and skills handed down to them by their ancestors' ancestors, we know few who can rival the Kudemtu in their skill of animal husbandry or ability to bring forth the fruits of the earth."
 L08_a_divided_nation: "A Divided Nation"
 L08_a_divided_nation_desc: "Kulugiash has always been split between the Khetist settlers in the highlands and the native followers of the Medasi Pantheon down in the savanna. For centuries we have been able to preserve peace between our people, but the collapse of Kheterata has caused tensions to start bubbling beneath the surface. These divisions in our nation cannot last forever. But, at least for now, we have ways to quell these dissidents."
 L08_a_modern_army: "A Modern Army"
 L08_a_modern_army_desc: "During the Second Kuiika Wars, the might of the Kuiika army was feared throughout Horashesh. Their numbers dwarfed their Horasheshi neighbours and it seemed inevitable their forces would crush any resistance. However, under the leadership of Esi ‘the Gunman’, a general in the Kulugiash army with a radical approach to military reform, the Kulugiash military was equipped with firearms purchased from Cannorian traders. At the Battle of Shen Yunas, it is said not a single Kuiika warrior reached the Kulugiash battlelines, with every single one being struck down by musket fire."

 L69_scaleguard_resilience_desc: "Many years ago, the Scaleguards ruled at the top of a great Anzalkatsa Empire. But foreign invasions and treachery at home toppled us, and our empire was reduced to nothing. One would think, as has happened to so many other ruling dynasties, that we would have fallen to nothing too. Hah! We laugh at such absurdities. We live still, and thrive in Serat—we have survived against all odds!"
 L69_the_worthy_foe: "The Worthy Foe"
 L69_the_worthy_foe_desc: "It has been so since ancient times, and persists as such today: the cat and the lizard shall fight, and neither dares underestimate the other. Centuries of rivalry and combat between us and our eternal foes have yielded a familiarity with Khet military tactics unrivaled anywhere in Halann. Others may shatter before Khet offensives, but not us—we will have prepared well in advance, for we know our foe and respect its power too much to be complacent.  "
 L69_loyal_bloodlines: "Loyal Bloodlines"
 L69_loyal_bloodlines_desc: "Meritocracy is not for us. More important, more trustworthy is seniority and right of blood. Inherited experience from generations of competent servants of the rulers of Zerat is the surest guarantor of loyalty and ability today. Our ancient noble families know this, and so they have always placed themselves at our service. So it has been, so it will be—and so Zerat shall prosper."
 L69_waters_of_life: "Waters of Life"
 L69_waters_of_life_desc: "If one looks at the core reasons why Zerat is as exalted as it is, surely the waters of our home must be one of them. We would not be able to hold the line through the ages if we did not live on the shores of great Lake Lasadza, most beautiful and bounteous of all the lakes in the world. The lake graces us with as much water as we could possibly need for agriculture. But that is not all: great Lasadza holds many unique species of fish, and other diverse aquatic life. Small wonder, then, that we have as much produce as we do."
 L69_rushdown_tactics: "Rushdown Tactics"
 L69_rushdown_tactics_desc: "Armaments and soldiers are all well and good in their own way but they become worthless if they cannot move from one place to the next within their homeland quickly. Fortunately for us, years of fighting for control over Zerat and its surroundings have enabled us to develop what are called 'rushdown tactics'. Zerat forces maneuver quickly through our home terrain, which every soldier must know like the back of their hand, and disappear as quickly as they appear, leaving defeated armies in their wake."
 L69_centralization_reforms: "Centralization Reforms"
 L69_centralization_reforms_desc: "For ages, we were governed by a relatively decentralized system—our ruler devolved power upon vassals, and those vassals governed in the ruler's name, handing produce, tax, and soldiers back to the central government. That persisted until a minister, named after the great Chief Ptolek, realized that holding to this system could only lead to opportunism and rebellion. Thus he, in proper devotion to Zerat and our serene dynasty, convinced his liege to centralise the realm. The result was the Ptolekas Reforms; thanks to them, all power in Zerat is now centralised upon the ruler, and the vassals serve only at their liege's pleasure."

Time was that we ruled all of our kind; though we lost that power for a time, Zerat still stands proud among its scaled peers today. But let the world take note: it is only a matter of time before we are made ruler of all lizardfolk again, until the 332nd Empire dies and the 333rd Empire rises. When that time comes, Halann will know and take note: our ruler will no longer be a mere 'king' or 'chieftain', but an Antsakirak—a god-emperor!"

 L84_a_city_in_the_ruins_desc: "Over millennia Shalazar has served as the capital for hundreds of Lizardfolk empires, with the Anzara empire being only the most recent. With the empire’s collapse and the ensuing centuries of foreign raids and economic decline, the once-grand city has fallen far from its glory days, now little more than a fortified town squatting in the deserted ruins of one of ancient Sarhal’s largest cities. Once the seat of power for continental empires, now Shalazari rule extends only over a handful of cities and a single vassal-tribe. However, the lakeside land remains rich and fertile, and the empty stone buildings and old farming terraces that cover the hillsides make it easy to expand the current settlement."

For millennia Lizardfolk across Taneyas have made pilgrimage to this sacred temple, but now it also sees visitors of a different kind: five centuries ago, Raktaya Ashaktiz renovated the eastern hall with the petrified skeletons of enormous fish and reptiles unearthed in a slate quarry in Ashakani, and now the temple attracts fascinated naturalists from Kheterata to Baashidi!"

Given our ancient history and grand priesthood, our citizenry are also amongst the most fervent believers in the ancient tenets of Anzalkatsa: that 332 times has Taneyas been united and divided, and an immortal empire will be the one to unite our land for a final 333rd time. Every citizen of Shalazar holds this story in their heart, and they show a willingness without peer to enlist and take up arms to ensure that it is glorious Shalazar that will claim the 333rd thone, and lead all of Taneyas to an eternal place in the sun."
 L84_ward_against_the_east: "Ward Against The East"
 L84_ward_against_the_east_desc: "Our proximity to the borderlands of the Tanizu often leaves us bearing the brunt of attempted foreign invasions from the east. The lakes and mountains surrounding Shalazar are already dotted with ancient fortifications, and now an enterprising young naga mage has taken it upon herself to enchant one of these fortresses with a ward of regenerating stone. There is clear potential to apply this technique on a larger scale."
 L84_magic_and_the_citizenry: "Magic And The Citizenry"
 L84_magic_and_the_citizenry_desc: "Investing in more accessible magical schooling for common citizens is a cornerstone of our state's education policy. While some would question the value of training those who might never manage more than a handful of spells, many of these lizardfolk go on to labor in our city's countless workshops and provide us with an ample supply of enchanted weaponry and ammunition. From fire-charmed polearms to cursed knives, combat against a Shalazari infantry regiment is normally a surprising and painful experience."
 L84_abundant_priesthood: "Abundant Priesthood"
 L84_abundant_priesthood_desc: "Already situated at the edge of Taneyas, the emergence of the Ashhama from Yezel Mora a millennia ago and their abandonment the Scaled Gods’ teachings left Lizardfolk in Odu Kherass isolated from other followers of Anzalkatsa. Fortunately, we have long been blessed with an abundance of Naga as a reward for our faith, and now as we expand our territory, our well-staffed priesthood allows us to place shrines and attendant Naga in every newly conquered township. With so many Naga, we can efficiently bring the guidance – and the control – of our faith to newly conquered humans and wayward Ashhama alike."

The old imperial roads, rebuilt and broadened, have extended to encompass the new cities that dot the hills and lowland jungles, carrying soldiers and travellers, communication and commerce.

 S15_the_crater_city_of_karshyr_desc: "When Karshyr was first built, it was contained entirely within the half-collapsed crater of an extinct volcano, but as the city expanded to become one of the Anzara Empire's largest, the crater-city was designated to be a palace and temple complex, while the rest of the city's functions were relocated beyond the crater. Being surrounded on all sides either by volcano walls or steep cliffs facing the ocean, the inner city's lack of space and near inaccessibility, save for a narrow mountainside path, meant that Karshyr had to employ various advanced architectural methods and urban planning techniques to make the most out of inner city’s available space, which translated over to other Karshyray settlements."
 S15_vyzemby_ties: "Vyzemby Ties"
 S15_vyzemby_ties_desc: "The Karshyray Lizardfolk are among the few Lizardfolk who maintain cordial relations with the Vyzemby, which is rooted in their mutual seafaring lifestyle, shared distaste of Karassk due to their subjugation under the Karasskas Empire, and trade ties maintained by their Lizardfolk brethren living in the Fahvanosy. Most of these Lizardfolk in fact descend from independent-minded Karshyray who left to make a new life away from Karasskay oppression.\n\nKarshyr's long trade-ties with the Vyzemby has invariably made them the main trade link between the Lizardfolk and Vyzemby, and has left a legacy of open-mindedness towards foreigners and their ideas in the Rankaty Islands. This led to Karshyr being the first Lizardfolk nation to establish trade and diplomatic ties with Cannorian nations, and adopting new institutions and technologies from them."
 S15_mausoleum_of_the_venerable: "Mausoleum Of The Venerable"
 S15_mausoleum_of_the_venerable_desc: "At the heart of Karshyr lies the Mausoleum of the Venerable: a colossal temple complex dating back to the times of the Anzara Empire, which serves as the resting place of many of Karshyr's and the Karasskay Empire's greatest leaders, mages and priests. Famous for the fabulous wealth and ancestral treasures its crypts contain, it's also a target for foreign thieves and adventurers to plunder. As a result, the Grave Wardens, crater-city's caretakers and ceremonial guardians, have taken to patrolling the outer layers of the temple, while filling its inner sanctums with traps and monsters in an effort to protect the monument from any potential looters."
 S15_the_anonymous_of_karshyr: "The Anonymous Of Karshyr"
 S15_the_anonymous_of_karshyr_desc: "A Karshyray hydromancer and chronicler from the times of the Anzara Empire, who wrote the oldest surviving book about Lizardfolk history. Despite how little is known of him, the meticulous detail he put into his research and writing not only preserved much information that is otherwise lost, but the historical methods he employed were unparalleled until contemporary times and played a noteworthy role in ending the Cannorians' perception of the Lizardfolk as a monstrous race, making him a highly respected figure in Karshyr."
 S15_hydromancers_guild: "Hydromancer's Guild"
 S15_hydromancers_guild_desc: "Karshyr once rivaled Karassk for the mastery of the seas, which was reflected in the city once having been the centre of the Anzara Empire's hydromancers. Even today, the Hydromancers' Guild plays an important role in Karshyr's society - calming the seas for sea-travel, summoning rains for agriculture, operating the underwater seaweed plantations, and utilising hydromancy in dye-making processes at the Dye-works. As a result of the wealth and stability the mages bring to the islands, they're a deeply influential and respected actor in the daily life of Karshyray citizens."
 S15_mystics_of_the_third_eye: "Mystics Of The Third Eye"
 S15_mystics_of_the_third_eye_desc: "The “three-eyed ones” are a rare strain of Lizardfolk most common in the Rankaty Islands, who are born with a unique organ called 'the Third Eye' on their forehead. The Third Eye allows these Lizardfolk to perform various magical feats, like sense the magical power in their surroundings, communicate telepathically, read and control minds, extend their lifespan, and even fuse their soul with the third eye, turning it into a pearl-like crystal that retains their consciousness after death.\n\nThe Three-Eyed Lizardfolk once worked under the Naga, but for unknown reasons, no Nagas have been born in the Rankaty Islands since the Day of Ashen Skies, which also led to more Three-Eyed Lizardfolk being born. As a result, Mystics of the Third Eye have compensated for their niche to become the magical and spiritual leaders of Karshyr, making them greatly valued and respected among the islanders."
 S15_aquaculture_pioneers: "Aquaculture Pioneers"
 S15_aquaculture_pioneers_desc: "The Rankaty Islands' waters are rich with marine life, but the most economically significant of them are the various species of seaweeds, which are used for dye production to such an extent that underwater plantations were created to fuel the ever-increasing demand for the Karshyray seaweed dyes. While Karshyr has remained the biggest dye producer in the Lizardfolk lands, it was held back by most of its dye-works and underwater plantations having been destroyed during the Day of Ashen Skies. Their reconstruction resulted in a massive increase in dye production, but also revealed several inefficiencies in the ancient farming methods, which could be amended with modern technologies. Over time, the studies in aquaculture led to Karshyr pioneering aquacultural advancements that expanded beyond algae farms - underwater fish farms would come to raise various animals, from milkfish and shrimps to lobsters, pearl oysters and even the fearsome dragonfish."
