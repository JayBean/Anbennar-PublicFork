 orcish_beserker_frenzy_desc:0 "Known by the dwarves since times immemorial, the dreaded berserk fury of the orcs was only first truly appreciated by the surface-folk during the devastation of Escann in the Greentide. Few formations can withstand the terrible might of a frenzied warband's charge."
 orcish_control_the_clans:0 "Control the Clans"

 orcish_teach_the_young_desc:0 "Ours is a cruel and unforgiving world, and it is best that the young learn of the harsh truths of life sooner rather than later. This ensures that we always have a supply of world-wise warriors at the ready when life eventually claims our own."

While we seem to have lost this ability after Dookan's son, Korgus' passing, our colour is still adapted to that of our current environment."
 orcish_orcish_legions:0 "Orcish Legions"

 goblin_sneaky_tactics_desc:0 "We goblins were nothing but fodder to the  Dookanson, used as flimsy meat shields. And while we were slaughtered by adventurer firearms, the orcs mindlessly charged after the first barrage, running over every dying goblin and bringing them to an agonising end.\n\n Now that we are free, this will no longer be. We will fight as we learned in the darkness of the caverns, cleverly hiding and attacking with poisoned arrows, ambushing enemy leaders and bleeding their armies. This is the way of goblin warfare, and it is the way we will forever follow as long as we are free."

 goblin_life_under_the_blue_sky_desc:0 "Though still a hostile place with our former captors and adventurers still lurking, Escann is a much more pleasant place to live than the Serpentspine, with its lush forests and serene lakes. Here, we  need not fight over any source of food or water for there is plenty for all.\n\n With this bounty has come changes among the clans. The ancient traditions celebrated in the darkness of the caves are now festivals in the sunlight and under the shadow of ancient ruined temples consecrated to the many gods of mankind. In this beautiful place, we gblins can create something better than our ancient homeland. Perhaps we found a home at last."
 goblin_looting_for_knowledge:0 "Looting For Knowledge"
 goblin_looting_for_knowledge_desc:0 "Escann is not only rich in food and resources, but also knowledge. Among the old human ruins are books, scrolls and all manner of written stuffs that survived the desolation brought by the Dookanson. All as valuable as any other loot.\n\n However, these texts are written in a language unlike the crude tongue of the Dwarves we came to grudgingly learn. If we are to make use of this treasure we must decipher this language.  Fortunately, we goblins are equally cunning and intelligent. To learn this “common” script, we will capture those adventurers who can and force them to teach us the language of humanity, and learn from the knowledge left by those who inhabited these beautiful lands before us"
 goblin_the_naegub:0 "The Naegub"
 goblin_the_naegub_desc:0 "With the progressive modernisation of the clans, a new social class is emerging, created by those goblins who are considered within the clan to be the most astute and have the best manners, as well as having managed to adapt more quickly to the language of humanity than their congeners. They are the Naegub.\n\n Ranging from merchants to negotiators and even diplomats, they act as the link between the clan and the realms of the other civilised races. They are involved in every transaction and negotiation, be they commercial or political, always wringing the most they can for the clan (and themselves). As such, it is a role of great power. Something that garners immense respect, and envy, within the clan."
 goblin_always_prepared:0 "Always Prepared"

 pactseeker_forest_goblin_with_a_little_help_from_my_friends:0 "With a Little Help From My Friends"
 pactseeker_forest_goblin_with_a_little_help_from_my_friends_desc:0 "Governing is all about delegating. No one can do everything. The archfey, who we have made extensive pacts with in the past, rely on our warlocks to make their sometimes incomprehensible agendas a reality. The chain of delegation doesn’t stop there, though. As we may work for the archfey, other fey may work for us.\n\nOne example is the Aralez. These fey come in the shape of winged dogs and are exceptional at carrying mail and messages, all for a bit of consistent attention. Another common fey we work with are fairies. They can be difficult partners, but are excellent consequences for missed taxes. And we shouldn’t forget a favorite of all administrators, Dobies. Scarcely coming up to a goblin’s knees, Dobies will faithfully copy any text or writ given a pact for a warm hearth.\n\nSuffice to say, we’ve gotten very good at delegating. It’s no wonder that our clan functions smoother than so many others."

 pactseeker_forest_goblin_for_our_patrons_and_us_desc:0 "By now, everyone knows how closely coupled our clan is with the fey. It is natural for others to assume that our clan’s actions are not just our own choosing, but also our patrons’. We’ve found this to be particularly useful during peace negotiations.\n\nMore than once, as we sat across from defeated foes carving out our rightful winnings, we’ve found the threat of invoking our patrons’ wrath to be enough to quiet any protests. After all, what’s the loss of one more province compared to the anger of the archfey?"
 pactseeker_forest_goblin_secrets_of_the_fey:0 "Secrets of the Fey"
 pactseeker_forest_goblin_secrets_of_the_fey_desc:0 "The ignorant believe that the Fey are bound to the Feyrealm. And fools assume that the only connection between Halann and the Feyrealm is the Deepwoods. We are neither ignorant nor foolish. \n\nGiven enough will and power, a fey can cross into our world. And, throughout not just Cannor but all of Halann, there are many portals tucked away connecting our plane and the Fey’s. Perfect for the Fey we have pacts with to cross through.\n\nFrom these crossings, these fey have seen many things. They’ve heard many whispers of knowledge. And sometimes they deign to share those with us."

 old_ways_forest_goblins_never_trust_a_fey_desc:0 "“Remember, Syz. You cannot trust the Fey.”\n“I know, papa. But, I want to know why.”\n“Because long ago, the Fey betrayed the Goblins.”\n“For doing what?”\n“Nothing.”\n“That’s not a good reason!”\n“Does a beast need a reason to bite you? It’s just its nature.”\n“So all fey are bad?”\n“That’s right, Syz. All fey are bad. And we must always be watchful.”\n“Okay, papa.”"
 old_ways_forest_goblins_the_other_goblins:0 "The Other Goblins"
 old_ways_forest_goblins_the_other_goblins_desc:0 "Our clan has changed. We are still a tribe of goblins, but not all of us call ourselves Forest Goblins. Many in our clan are newly freed slaves from the wretched orcs. Unlike us, they come not from dark forests of the Deepwoods but rather from the deep caverns of the Serpentspine. \n\nWhile we do not regret saving them from orcish oppression, we cannot help but recognize they are a little strange. They don’t talk quite like us. They don’t look quite like us. And, they don’t think quite like us. The first one can be fixed. The second we will just have to ignore. But, the last one… it might prove valuable."
 old_ways_forest_goblins_from_the_fringes:0 "From the Fringes"
 old_ways_forest_goblins_from_the_fringes_desc:0 "Our clan is all too familiar with making more with less. Our ancestors, their ancestors, and THEIR ancestors spent their lives on the edges of the various groves that dot the Deepwoods. It was a poor place, little more than sticks, stones, and a whole lot of nasty creatures wanting to eat goblins. Despite this, the Forest Goblins endured and even thrived. The beasts that threatened us quickly learned our old adage - “Sticks and stones can break bones.”\n\nToday, our clan has a proper home and proper weapons. But that doesn’t mean we’ve forgotten how much can be done with less, and the tenacious spirit of our ancestors is still with us."
 old_ways_forest_goblins_clanboss_by_prowess_not_pact:0 "Clanboss by Prowess, Not Pact"
 old_ways_forest_goblins_clanboss_by_prowess_not_pact_desc:0 "Every goblin clan needs a clanboss. They need a goblin who ensures that a clan works together, with an iron fist as needed. Us forest goblins are no different. However, there are some that believe that a pact with a dirty fey is all you need to become clanboss. That a little bit of unearned magic will get you the clan’s respect.\n\nNot in our clan.\n\nOnly the strongest goblins, the smartest goblins, and the biggest goblins have the right to be clanboss. A clanboss must earn their position. And that means showing you’ve got what it takes."

 deepwood_orc_everything_not_nailed_down:0 "Everything Not Nailed Down"
 deepwood_orc_everything_not_nailed_down_desc:0 "When we arrived in Escann from the depths of the Serpentspine, we were amazed by all the riches that could be plundered from even the smallest towns and villages. No longer did we have to live on scraps, as any orc under Dookanson could provide for themselves if they could swing an axe. In the Deepwoods, however, we have had to make do with less once again. There isn’t all that much to go around, so you’d better make sure you take all you can get."
 deepwood_orc_unending_warfare:0 "Unending Warfare"
 deepwood_orc_unending_warfare_desc:0 "Since the moment we entered the Deepwoods, we have not had a moment of rest. Unlike the Escanni, every single denizen of the woods knows how to wield a blade, and they have all been raised against us. All the better. We shall keep fighting, and we shall become more tenacious with each battle, more vigilant with each ambush, more brutal with each raid."
 deepwood_orc_towns_of_stone_and_wood:0 "Towns of Stone and Wood"
 deepwood_orc_towns_of_stone_and_wood_desc:0 "As the invasion has dragged on, the orcish forces have slowly dragged to a halt. The tide of  invasion has turned into raids and counter raids, and mobile war encampments have turned into palisaded settlements. Unwelcome as we may be, we live here now, and we had better act like it. There is rock and wood aplenty, and we will build our new home with them. We are here to stay."
 deepwood_orc_legacy_of_the_great_invasion:0 "Legacy of the Great Invasion"
 deepwood_orc_legacy_of_the_great_invasion_desc:0 "The great orcish invasion was the largest army the Deepwoods had ever seen. An amalgamation of many clans, the invasion force cut through the forest and obliterated all opposition. So successful were the early advances of the warbands that latecomers to a battle had barely any work to do in picking off the stragglers. This bred an eagerness for glory in all the clans, who were always eager to get their part of the battle before it was over."
 deepwood_orc_strong_chieftans:0 "Strong Chieftains"
 deepwood_orc_strong_chieftans_desc:0 "The Greentide in Escann was shattered abruptly when Korgus was slain, the now-leaderless clans frenziedly gathering what power they could for themselves in the aftermath. This did not occur in the Deepwoods, where Korgus was always a distant figure and the clans functioned with great autonomy.  By the time that news of Korgus’ death reached the forest, the unity of the clans had long since disintegrated and the chieftains warred against each other from their own autonomous domains. Though these internecine battles sapped their strength, their lack of reliance on central authority left the Deepwoods orc chiefdoms far stronger than their Escanni counterparts in the long run."

This, however, does not mean they are respected.\n\nStarting in 1620, Eilísin began expanding their policy of mages assisting wine production, through the use of spells, in order to meet the growing demand for Eilísin Tríros, disregarding these well recorded laws of magic. To the despair of the rulers of Eilísin the increased usage of magic did not increased crop yields in the long term, seemingly having the opposite effect. In order to remedy this state mages, and even rulers, went down unnatural paths to restore the fertility of the soil and meet the ever-growing market, to keep the profits flowing.\n\nDuring the reign of Rewan IV there were many instances of bodies of farm workers being found, their life force drained. While they were never linked to Rewan IV directly, these rumours proved too much for the Lorentish King at the time, who called for Rewan's execution and had his titles confiscated.\n\nRewan was never executed, disappearing on the day of his execution."

Imbued with new purpose Maugun set about catching the beast; stalking the Unicorn for a year before he caught it.\n\nBlessed with his new mount, and a refocused purpose, Maugun returned to his home of High Ording. He found it in flames. Without a moment's hesitation Maugun flew toward the besieged town, barely dodging a fireball, thrown his way by a marauding mage. Moving fast so as to avoid a second fireball Maugun sped toward the man, killing him in a single strike. Fortunately, the raiding force was a small one, and with the help of a few volunteers they were easily routed.\n\nIn the following year Maugun fought hard to defend his home. His valiant bravery made him popular with the locals, who coined the name "Maugun the Unicorn Knight", and later he befriended King Rewan Lorentis of Lorent, who granted him the Duchy of Great Ording.

For Rubyhold the Institute has been an important way of keeping tabs on what humans are doing, with the added benefit of sometimes uncovering new ideas the dwarves had not considered.\n\nMost famously, it is here that the Lencori Plan was devised: the idea of creating a human nation out of the local tribes to act as a shield against external threats for Rubyhold.

Among the lessons learnt: having an outer set of gates, instead of just relying on the main gates of the hold for protection. These were named the Redgate and the Rivergate. Wrought and rewrought five times in our history in response to new lessons. The gates have stood up against the Ashen Skies, the Dragonswake, and foul sorceries.

The distances involved in transporting them, combined with the relative scarcity, meant West Rubies have historically commanded a premium price.\n\nThe most famous West Ruby is disputed, most go to the Great Rose on the Ruby Crown of Lorent, which is ringed by five lesser rubies, collectively assembled to create a stylised rose. As a result, many Cannorians also refer to West Rubies as Rose Rubies.\n\nIn cultures further east that is not the case, West Rubies being associated with sunset, blood, or endings instead. The ancient crown, the Dwarovkron of the Dwarven Empire was said to have the largest West Ruby as its centrepiece, which was a late addition to the crown to mark the official recognition of Rubyhold as a hold equal to those underneath the Serpentspine. Such a controversial decision sparked the last great civil war of Aul-Dwarov, the War of the Bloody Gem, which to many was the final omen leading to the Last Days of the Dwarovar and the fall of dwarven civilization."

The discovery of new world gems in the colonies only increased the quantity of gems arriving in Rubyhold for cutting. During the 1600s ruby dwarves began setting up gem cartels, in many cases directly taking over the operation of mines in the new world. With long mining expertise, many countries were eager to accept the assistance of the cartels in their colonies. Those cartels funnelled gems of all shapes and sizes back to Rubyhold. Gems from Lorentish colonies arriving via Oldport and the Redgate, gems from imperial colonies arriving via Exwes and the Rivergate.

The lead designer of the renovation, Teagan of Freecestir, was struck with an idea upon seeing the behemoth banners; a way to not only incorporate them into the Castle, but to create a new array of defenses. Every section of wall was covered in banners, with very little space between them or the ground. Behind any banner could be a hidden door, a trap of some sort, additional arrow slits, or simply nothing.

But following some incident (the details are unclear) shortly after he turned 25, he was all-but-exiled from the land of his birth, and he headed east to find better fortunes in the foreign realm called Castanor.\n\nHe found a place tending to Castan V the Great's wolf-hounds, descendants of those raised by Castan II Beastbane. Though a lowly kennel assistant, he struck up a friendship with the Castan, whose favourite past-time was hunting with his canine companions, and deeply appreciated their beauty and vigor.\n\nWhen the Castan marched on the Alenic Frontier, Clothar accompanied him as assistant and retainer, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Legion II Vertesk. When the wars came to a conclusion, Castan the Great granted him a large swathe of land (including Derwing), elevating him as a 'civilized' and 'domesticated' Alenic.\n\nThe Lord Derwing, ruler of the Lower Alen under Castanor, would serve well for roughly two decades more, keeping his vassals at bay (though they despised him) and visiting Castanor every year or two to make personal reports to the Castan. But following his death to a bone cancer, many vassals refused to pay his successors any fealty whatsoever — they were denigrated as 'sons of a bitch, the lot of 'em' — and most lands beyond Derwing itself were lost.\n\nThis is our legacy, well-earned by service and never revoked from the family of Derwing.

And so, the regent sent Petran to spend his youth amongst the city folk of Esmarainé, the old capital of the disbanded Grand Duchy of Esmaria.\n\nAmongst the Esmarainé wealthy, and their extravagant parties, Petran would learn three skills that would serve him well for the rest of his days: how to drink, how to argue, and how to tell when someone was bluffing. With these experiences in tow, Petran would return home a skillful diplomat and would lead Terr through the harsh realities of imperial politics.\n\nWhen Petran's children came of age, he would send them off to Esmarainé as well to experience it just as he had.

In the north, the hunters of Bennon wished to secure the Havoral Divide, and Terr's lands in Havorton lied in their way. To survive, Terr would have to act decisively.

While this act put Terr at odds with their overlord, they would go on to side with the mages along with many other minor lords when the civil war would break out in 1253.\n\nMany years after the war, Terr's fondness of Aranthíl and the Magisterium has never waned.

She wished not to ask the other lords for help lest they take advantage of Havorton's precarious situation and lay claim to the county to prevent the Havoric Kingdom from rising again, and so sought alliance with Warin, another lesser noble like her who happily accepted the countess's hand in marriage, bringing Havorton under Terr's rule.\n\nWarin marched confidently into Havorton with little heed of the enemy forces. What he assumed would be a ragged band of vagabonds turned out to be an army led by Henric the Fierce, a Havoric descendant gathering power to restore the kingdom, starting at its ancestral capital of Havorton. When all seemed lost, Warin picked up the fallen eagle banner and waved it high, reminding his men of the countless drills and battles that have been fought under it over the centuries, successfully driving Henric's men into the Esmar river and filling it with blood.

These Black beetles wandered from one flower to the next, chewing them clear of their petals.\n\nWhen the halfling, Isabella Brightflower, heard of the blooms deep in the Terr forests, she departed Viswall immediately with dye tools in tow. Brightflower set up a small lab on the edge of the forest and went to work. She found meager success, as each of the flowers produced too little pigment per petal to be an efficient dye. One day she came in and, to her horror, found her red flower petals had been eaten by dozens of bright red beetles. However, Brightflower recognized these beetles as the Terrman flower beetles, only they had turned a brilliant red, and then she had an idea. It turns out that the beetles turn the same color as the flowers they are fed, allowing for intricate and precise colors to be manufactured.\n\nBrightflower soon found herself in a storm of new dyes and colors. Unfortunately, the beetles never managed to survive the trip back to Viswall and so, Brightflower set up shop in Terr. While the dyes were never produced in the same quantities as they were in Viswall, the colors were still brilliant and easily distributed throughout Esmaria, bringing great wealth to Terr and her people."

In short time, the order seized the whole of Loveswood and united with the Ryalan Temple, serving as its militant arm in a revolt that resulted in the death of the Themarennic Duke and a suing of peace soon following.

Yet, amongst the clergy, a priestess by name of Kerstie of Tretun would rise to carry the burden of leadership and the mantle of High Priestess. It was she who skillfully negotiated with the Emperor to convince him to enact "The Ryalan Privilege": a statute stating that in return for the Temple's legitimization and blessings of all Emperors' weddings in perpetuity, the Emperor would reaffirm the Temple's right to govern Ryalanar Proper and Loveswood.

The custom of the twin bands evolved to be associated with - and became the dominant symbol of - Ryala (and therefore true love) and was proselytized throughout the old empire to noble and commoner alike to both honor Castan's success and help popularize the first marriage rites of the emergent Cult of Ryala."

 A43_springtime_floods_of_the_ryal_desc:0 "Just as the river Esmar flows through Esmaria, so too does the Ryal flow through old Ryalanar. Oddly, the Ryal, by proportion, floods its banks nearly twice as high as nearby rivers every thawing of the spring and many consider this phenomenon to be a holy occurence. In fact, the flooding of the river is so consistent that natural scientists within the Empire have been able to predict river levels within an infinitesimal margin of error. Curiously, the villages and towns lining the Ryal have also been the origin of more than a few avatars of Ryala. Whether this is due to the increased presence of Ryalan clergy in the area to recognize avatars or the river being truly blessed by Ryala is still a hotly debated topic amongst the top scholars of the faith."

Traditional Ryalan marriages were considered by many Corinite folk in Escann as overly formal and even austere occasions; and most importantly: a symbol of Adeanic control. Among other upheavals, the most noteable and controversial was the disregard of the old marriage ceremonies: replaced by immethodical celebrations, wedding bands by cameo pendants, and white dresses by simple blouses; further reinforcing the Cannorian religious and cultural divide. It was not until the Corinite Wars had reached their apex that the High Priestess of Ryala, in an effort to limit violence between sects, proclaimed that the new Escanni marriages and customs would be considered legitimate by the clergy of Ryala and upheld as the "Canons of Escanni Rite"."

Of old ages past, tyrannical warlords and righteous kings alike vyed for the hands of Lady Ryala's incarnations, hoping to prove themselves worthy by word or pursuing their desire through deeds of arms and armies: tales as ancient as the faith itself. Yet, these tales are not just that: the most recent conflict for an avatar being between the Duchies of Cestirande and Istralore. As the conflict reached unprecedented levels of bloodshed with no end in sight, the Emperor declared all hostilities between the two duchies must cease in order for the matter to be settled by the High Priestess of Ryala. It was ruled that a contest of affection would be held with the ultimate choice of who she would wed, if any, being decided by the avatar herself, marking what is known as the first diplomatic solution to a conflict for the hand of a Ryalan avatar."

Fortunately, Silverforge evaded scrutiny due to slavery here being based on a system of indentured service and intergenerational debt for the crimes of the orcs against civilization.

The challenge spread to the Esmari river parties, where humans would line up to challenge the iron gullet of a dwarf. Some dwarves would accept multiple opponents at once to even the odds, with little change to the outcome.\n\nThe true show only really began when orcs challenged dwarves to the competition.

This would soon be answered as, after a few decades of exploration, ancient dwarven weaponry was being discovered with some finding their way outside of the Serpentspine for those with enough coin.\n\nWith these ancient weapons, the task of replicating their design was assigned to Grun Strongbellow. As the head of the project, he worked tirelessly and was able to make an early redesign of a rifle in 1523. It was fairly accurate for the time but would be too expensive for army-wide use. With this limited success, he went on to update the artillery batteries that Silverforge used, keeping them above the curve in comparison to their neighbors.\n\nStrongbellow would die in 1589 of natural causes and would be remembered in Silverforge for his dedication and ingenuity. In 1652, a university was built and named after him dedicated to Gunsmithing and Metallurgy."

Under the Akalate of Dartaxagerdim, however, a renaissance of all things magical began under the patronage of the sages of the szal-Fazil.

Serving as a conduit for those disillusioned with Sun Elf rule across Baharšes, szel-Harrumaz coalesced his newfound followers from across a myriad of Old Sun Cult traditions into a single unified and fanatic force, the Šebhuliam, meaning green helmets in Bahari. This was  a militant sect dedicated to the sole purpose of ridding Bulwar of the Sun Elf yoke, just as it had thrown off that of the gnolls and the Djinn.

Upon its discovery, Irsakar gifted the hold to the dwarves of his kingdom to resettle in exchange for their service.

For decades, the council would convene and arguments would rage with each clan claiming some legitimacy or prestige that would validate their claim to rule the rest. In the interim, a single clan was selected to oversee administration of the hold with term limits of 20 years.

While not all dwarven sailors belong to this clan, for much of history they were the most likely dwarves to be found trading hold supplies with Ruby Dwarves in Oldport, competing with the copper merchants of Busirat, haggling for grain along the Coast of Tears, or buying silks in Brasan.

Whenever the political tide turned against Ovdal Tûngr, they could leverage these debts to ensure their advantage. This changed, however, with the arrival of Jaher and his elven legions. To ensure the loyalty of his conquests, Jaher banished all dwarves from his realm and forgave all debts they owned. In response, Odval Tûngr sided itself with the resurgent Castanor led by the Sorcerer-King.

In 1491, however, a visiting dwarven inventor by the name of Grun Strongbellow would propose a new hydraulic system that could drain even the deepest of mines.

After the war he was ordered to give the lands he occupied with his army back to the Esmarians but he refused, and used his River-Reavers to continue to dominate the riverways of the Esmar against his foes.

The crystal was used to keep a simple transmutation spell that protected the silver from ever tarnishing.\nBut in 1440 Cristof was taken away from her far too soon, as he died during the Fourth Lilac War. When she found out about his unfortunate passing, she glanced at her ring. It was glowing as radiantly as it did the day it was made, not stained by a single smudge. At that moment, she realized that they were not connected in a mere union of a man and a woman. No. It was not only Reánna and Cristof who were united in wedlock.

Just outfitting for an expedition might cost a hefty chunk of the quest's potential profits, in terms of potions purchased and armor repairs.\n\nBut the ruinborn, ah the ruinborn... They will pay vast sums for shoddy muskets, and give away for almost-free magical reagents that artificers and sorcerers will pay trunks full of crowns for.

Some flee due to persecution of their faith, like the Corinites, while others flee because of unjust purges against their kind, like kobolds. Some are not pioneers but instead ruinborn, wanting to live in peace with their new neighbours.

The breaking of the Greentide in 1443, however, was a rallying cry to the dwarves of Cannor. Scions of lost holds, cartels, great families, even famous individuals, no matter the dwarf, all are kin of Balgar, all are kin of Dagrin Everbeard, and all have been roused to action!

As we restore our reclaimed holds and word of our success spreads, dwarves from all across the world flock to join us, united by a shared dream - a reborn Aul-Dwarov, a dwarven homeland restored to its legendary glory. Our ranks boast dwarves from every walk of life - no matter your birthplace, clan, or class. As much as the old dwarven clans that have persisted in the surface want to control our adventuring spirit - the reclamation of the Dwarovar somewhat mirrors the expulsion of our kin from the homeland so many years ago: it is a fresh start."

But the first two Fundamental Truths to life is that we all live in One World, and are created by One God, and so Varil did not stop there. By 1631, almost every Busilari ship engaged in the Kingdom's prodigious Sarhaly and Halessi trade would carry with it an array of new inventions along with a missionary who would use them to spread the teachings of the One God. In trading ports across Halann, in the wake of a Busilari trade fleet's visit, small communities of Ravelian adherents would undoubtedly spring up."

By 1441, all 86 packs of the Hillthrone gnolls had been subdued and united under her leadership, through war, diplomacy and marriage, thus becoming the first undisputed Queen-of-the-Hill in recent history. Whilst her enemies accuse her of having sold her firstborn to demons in exchange for power, these claims only exacerbate her already fearsome reputation, for she would stop at nothing to keep her people free from human domination."

To fix this, the seventh Queen-of-the-Hill, Zabrixa instituted the Brainmarrow Pact, demanding Hillthrone mercenaries working abroad to bring a piece of knowledge or technology every five years.\n\nThe plan saw great success, most likely because should they fail to meet that quota the mercenary's family would be executed, and whilst it didn't prevent the ultimate downfall of the Hillthrone Gnolls decades later, it did bring them closer to Cannorian culture and ideas."

Seeking asylum in nearby Sugamber, the Queen-of-the-Hill submitted herself and her last remaining armies to the duke, in exchange for a land to settle. Thus, the county of Honderaak was born.\n\nWhilst still looked down by most humans, these 'Dovesworn Gnolls' (as they'd eventually be called, after the Anbennarian sigil) eventually embraced human gods and traditions and become integrated within Sugamber society, some scholars even considering them a completely different race from their savage Sarhaly brethren due to their 'civilised' temperament."

 U08_unbroken_republic_desc:0 "The Republic of Ekha was established in 332 BA in opposition to Menkaunswt's conquest of Akasik. Despite being defeated on land, Ekha stood strong on the waves and managed to strike a favorable peace deal, keeping its autonomy in exchange for tribute. This continued until Damerians invaded Kheterata in 105 BA. This presence of another successful democracy in the Divenhal reassured the people of Ekha about republican government. Akasik was then conquered once again in 475 AA by Crodamic people. For some time the country was a vassal state of Akasik, until Sedoric I granted Ekha title of march as a gratification for help during Akasi Civil War. During the Era of Black Ice Akasik was conquered by Gerudian reaver Henrik Divenscourge, however his rule quickly ended and the people of Akasik took their land back from invaders. However, now Ekha is at the brink of destruction - the gnollish horde of Viakkoc is at the gates, only stopped by a yearly tribute. But the republic will not fall - not now and not in the future!"

 U08_dechan_frontier_desc:0 "Ekha is uniquely situated at the westernmost point in Sarhal which gives us geographical advantage to explore what lies beyond the vast ocean. This, combined with the dire situation of the country, gave the Dechan movement an opportunity to rise. Many merchants and traders travel to the new world establishing outposts and settlements to profit from transoceanic trade. Some of them however, want to escape their homeland, seeing the republic and vision of free Akasik as doomed; their foolishness will bring us glory and gold."

 U08_desati_sisterhood_desc:0 "People of Ekha don't consider Planetouched as holy as ancient Akasi or Fangaulans, but they still are an important part of culture and society; Desati Sisterhood exemplifies this state of things. Many Desati sisters are planetouched which is seen as a sign of nobility and blessing from Mother Akasik. It is said that they descend from Storm-Queens - the ancient rulers of Akasik. While this claim is probably incorrect, their influence over the republic cannot be underrated; daughters of storm, as they call themselves, hold many important societal, government and military positions. They are based in numerous secluded sanctuaries in Akasik mountains however some live in city temples to help local communities. "
 U08_pri_nebiw:0 "Pri Nebiw"
 U08_pri_nebiw_desc:0 "Pri Nebiw, translating to “The House of Gold” refers to the splendorous palace in the center of the city of Ekha. It holds many important facilities - courts, assembly hall, diplomats and president's quarters, and even prison. Dripping with gold and silver, it is a prime example of eclecticism - it mixes elements of Businori, Imperial, Fangaulan, Akasi, Kheteratan and even Gerudian architecture. It was built in 479, but was rebuilt multiple times, each time adding new elements, mostly to appease the Ramset - legislative body of the government, but also to show power and extent of influence of the state. It is the place where the most important decisions in political life of the republic happen - a single topic can be debated for days, if not for months. People say that's not because of their love for the republic, but rather to spend more time looking at this beautiful piece of art. And with the new age of the republic comes a new Palace worthy of our mighty empire."

Its service to the republic is indisputable, providing quality ships for times of peace and war. It was expanded multiple times, most notably during The Third Cinder War in effort to fasten ship production. Despite its importance, it has fallen into disrepair in times of gnollish subjugation due to lack of sufficient funds. But now it stands greater and more efficient than ever, restored in 1521 thanks to patrician patronage and most notably Izemrasen kas Diven's gift. Our outstanding engineers and new technological advances in shipbuilding allows arsenal to streamline ship production producing up to 1 ship per day while keeping them at exceptional quality."

With the major nobles of House Silcalas in Arbaran having joined the Moon Party, there was a lot of pressure on Kylian to follow suit. However, Kylian being cousins with the King of Lorent meant he held many Rose Party sympathies. This led to a meeting with the King of Lorent by the Rivergate to decide the role of Exwes in the upcoming conflict.\n\nHere, it was decided that it was better for Kylian to stay out of the conflict, to prevent the Silcalas family from installing a pretender. A compromise was reached with the neutrality of Exwes being guaranteed by the Rose Party and Exwes allowing military access to their members. With the Lilac Wars spiralling out of control with no end in sight, all consecutive rulers of Exwes have upheld the treaty to stay out of the conflict. Even after Arbaran switched sides in the Fourth Lilac War, Exwes remained neutral, despite the main reason for neutrality being gone.

As a foreign dynasty in Exwes, Alec made sure to be relatively lax in enforcing Silcalas views on religious and political matters to appease the local population, and become more Exwesser and Arbarani during his rule.\n\nThis lax attitude came to shape Exwes as a nation shortly after the Corinite Proclamation, when many of the disenfranchised came to Exwes to escape the religious conflict regardless of whether they supported Adean or Corin."

Our oldest tales cite that they fought waves of murderous trolls intent on destroying the Gerudians, yet over the years it has become clear that our early history with them is far more complex. From the oldest settlements along the coast such as Urviksten and Sporreyn, the Gerudians served the waning kingdoms of the Frost Giants alongside their Troll watchdogs.\n\nNestled in the steep valleys at the foot of the Titan’s Rest Mountains, Skaldol has long endured as a sacred site to Gerudians, thrice rebuilt in different ages. As much as times change, from the decline of the ice giants in aeons past to the death of Castanor itself, the mountains and coasts of Gerudia still fall yearly to Elkaesal’s wintry wrath. It is in Skaldol that the first snowflakes fall, and the last of the snow melts.

The Dragon and the Skald, the recounting of the One-Armed Skald’s fateful encounter with Elkaesal, is sung to herald the end of winter and warm even the bitterest winters, a matter of survival for Gerudia.

The draconic rime grew across the land like a fungus over a felled tree, freezing the very land itself.\n\nElkaesal the White watched in delight as the world around her fell into an endless winter. The holds of the Ebonsteel Kings were abandoned and lost under the snowfall, and all who could left Gerudia for lands not yet frozen. Determined to slay the wyrm, the greatest of heroes banded together to save their land! With axe and spear, bow and shield, these great men and women traversed the frigid land, following the trail of Elkaesal. Finally, in the heights of the Titan’s Rest Mountains, they found the dragon’s lair. Within a glaciated cave they intercepted the dragon, attacking with cunning, brawn, and zeal! One by one, the last heroes of Gerudia perished.\n\nBut not all was lost. Following behind, late to the battle, the One-Armed Skald and his students prepared to make their own stand. The Skald entered the cave alone, witnessing the dreadful scene of the slain heroes atop the plundered and frozen treasures of Gerudia. Under the dreadful gaze of Elkaesal’s baleful eyes, the One-Armed Skald began to sing a deep, soothing song - a tale of the dragons long ago. With each verse of the rise and fall of dragonkind, Elkaesal calmed and became drowsy, soon falling asleep into a deep slumber. With the dragon aslumber, the One-Armed Skald emerged from the cave to the First Thaw, the endless winter ended."

Whether burned and drowned by dragon’s fire, or felled by the axe of Gjalund, the rule of Giantkind has long since ended. Inscribed in runes, the tales of the earliest Gerudians have endured on ancient stones. Countless fearsome beasts prowl the forests and fjords, from lindwurms to trolls and werebears, all of which commit great evil before being slain by a valiant einher. From the dawn of time to now, these heroes have not only had their stories recorded and sung by skalds, but have also been mentored by them in the ways of war and life.\n\nBehind Bera, founder of Bjarnrík, were the skalds who fought the Trolls with song and spear. Behind Castan Ebonfrost were the skalds who terrified the Castanorians with our magic. With our guidance, kingdoms have risen. Those who set us aside have failed, fallen to history without our wisdom - Black Castanor set aside our guidance for those of the absent southern gods. Skaldskola has long been the mentor in the shadows of the hero - it is time to be our own legend."

While their magnificent ice-palaces have long since melted, these stone ruins are extensive around the still-standing towers of the Giant’s Manse.\n\nFrom these lonely islands, skalds have long studied the realm of the drowned giants.

Long-dormant seeds sprouted, enduring trees spread cones, and beasts of the land returned. For some time, only the One-Armed Skald and his few disciples walked the awakening land, witnessing the return of all life. For months they exchanged stories of the old world, but also spoke of the future.\n\nThe First Thaw of the snow and the blossom of flowers is celebrated as the start of the new year in Gerudia. It was then that the first Skaldhyrrics organized, teaching the returning peoples of the Elkaesal’s plight. Temples and mead halls are traditionally built in the spring, places where stories are recited and shared.

Aided by their stalwart allies in Bjarnrík, the Skaldic Guard cut down the invaders with halberd and shot, emboldened by the songs of old. The fires of the One-Armed Skald burned bright into the night, a beacon of hope in the war-torn land.\n\nIn Bjarnrík, the corrupt were tempted by the false promises of the Ravelians. Turning their back on their own countrymen for a comfortable place under their Gawedi masters, they struck from within and usurped the Crown of Bera. Skaldskola’s defenders, Olavish and Dalric, were soon cut off and abandoned. The Northern League conquerors cared not to defend Skaldol from Grombar, as they wished for the holy city and its faith to be eradicated. A final stand for the Skaldhyrric Faith, the Guard fought to defend every mile. It is said that the Skaldic Guard went down defending the Archives, for to this day the Ravelian occupiers have failed to plunder the heart of Gerudia."

Of course this is not the case, however, it does provide a valuable opportunity.

While the bill proved extremely difficult to enforce, it was enough to calm the people of Envermark and restore order to the city."

Under Adshaw Dinesck was nothing more than a mere momentary pause for dignitaries journeying to Bayvic. After Gawed turned its hungry eyes north but was solidly rebuffed by Bayvic in fierce fighting, they finally noticed Dinesck, saw the opportunity for a consolation prize, and the city wound up all-but-razed in a sacking by frustrated Gawedi soldiers. Even when goblins rose to power in so-called Bayvek, other Reachmen assumed the same must have happened in Dinesck.\n\nThis is an insult, but also an opportunity.

And when the Reach began to industrialize in the 17th century, the entire Alenic region suddenly hungered for wood to fuel the burgeoning furnaces and proto-factories.\n\nThis was invaluable for Dinesck as it recovered from the Gawedi sack; the city hired out logging teams across the Alen, while devouring more and more of the nearby woods itself. Under the Northern League, Dinesck was instrumental in felling vast swathes of forest fill the Magnates' coffers.

But more importantly, in Dinesck, Tola used the money to build a massive palace just outside the town. But the gentry of Dinesck had long disdained the city's lower classes, and would not relinquish their sneer when one suddenly ascended far beyond their assigned status. For all the palaces' lavish rooms and abundant ballrooms, they ignored any and all of Tola's invitations, not a one stepping foot in his 'Petty Palace'.\n\nTola would live and die in that building, and his fortune enriched two generations of descendants who did the same, before his grandson died without heirs. The Palace became used for two reasons: lumber storage, and impressing visitors who did not know its background.

These lands were almost free of any settlements, as they were as cold as inhospitable. Later, on the brink of the so-called Era of Black Ice, many Gerudian tribes started to settle in the White Reach, where they founded a village named Cedevik. With time, Cedevik grew. In fact, it grew so much that when Castan Ebonfrost became the ruler of Vrorenmarch, Cedevik already was the largest settlement in the whole White Reach.\nThe Castanorian Empire was well known for projects never before seen by a human eye, called Balgar’s Wonders, the nearest example being the citadel Bal Vroren. While maybe it was not Balgar who built our White Walls, it was the masons who were inspired by his works, learning from his blueprints and scriptures of the nearby citadel, who built our haven behind the walls, and as such Cedevik became a little wonder too."

When the first gray orcs laid siege to the city, an observation was made. While orcs are native to the darkness - they emerged from it, after all - their eyes need a little time every day to get accustomed to the sunlight. When the first rays of morning light hit the sea, the sailors knew they had a short span of time to get past the orcs undetected. These smugglers managed to keep the city’s sparse supplies lasting for far longer than anyone expected.\nStill, the situation became less and less sustainable as it became clear that no one else would break the siege. Cedevik was on its own. It may have been able to survive for ages, but how can you be truly alive when you're confined within a fortress until the end of times, living like an animal in a cage? The truth is that you can't, and no smuggler can replace that.\nBut they can replace many other things.

Eventually, they were given citizenship and granted the right to vote in 1584. Over the years it became more and more common to see a goblin candidate in what was previously a human position, and in 1602, Reb of the Westflowers, an incredibly popular goblin born and bred in Bayvic, was elected to the most high office of Bayvic, or Bayvek as the goblins call it.

That threat pushed the Gray Orc clans to unite faster and form Grombar, the Land of Gray People.\n\nOne of our new country's main policies was the destruction of orcish clans' importance in social life, tribal lands were revoked and tribesmen were settled in new cities, being forced to adapt to the new urban way of living.

With the greatest technologies, magical and otherwise, we shall build Nimrith anew. Great wings of gold and steel, powered by magic and great furnaces. Shimmering red scales of ruby, jasper and garnet, strengthened with mithril. A powerful maw that spews flames hot enough to rival dragonfire.

This would be used as the primary weapon for the new firedrake formations, who would fight on the frontlines of any offensive, burning away barricade and foe alike before the rest of our troops would jump in and finish off any stragglers."

As the Crimson Deluge and the League Wars ravaged Cannor, hundreds of thousands fled their homes to the shining, peaceful beacon called Anbenland. Faced becoming a nation filled with hungry peasantry lacking skills or crafts, the government enacted a quota on refugees entering the country. Later known as the Great Sorrow, it prioritized those refugees with useful skills and established a new service that those without skills could join to earn access to the safety of Anbenland. These skill-less but motivated souls were organized into The Dule Legion, named after a flock of doves and in honour of their selfless service to the state and her people.

Only effectively opposed by the Tefori Goldwater Squadrons and the Phoenix Armada of Elizna, the galleys of The Black Hulls were fast, maneuverable, and aggressive, favoring short engagements and boarding crews to extended exchanges of cannon fire.\n\nInvolved in privateering and smuggling as well as military operations, there were few sights as beautiful and dreadful for the merchant ships and coastal settlements of the Divenhal as that of Nathalaire's navy under full sail - The ebony wood, dark as night, gliding effortlessly over the waves on dozens of agile oars, their prows pointed towards their next target of trade or plunder."

Conceived of as a force that could fight on both land and sea, the Maritime Guard was the brainchild of the great Smuggler Prince Sigmund sil Heartspier, and proved their efficacy with their successful 1490 Invasion of Gemisle."

Slavery quickly became the single most important business in Nathalaire, and so many gnollish slavers flocked to the city to take part in the industry that Nathalaire's slave market was soon known by the gnollish name for it - 'The Krahzate.'\n\nNathalaire grew fabulously wealthy from the slave trade, but the 1589 Anbennarian Abolition led to a precipitous drop in the profitability of slaving. This unprofitability led Nathalairey slavers to turn their eyes towards other uses for their prisoners. Several naval captains noted that orc slaves could be put to use as rowers aboard galleys, their great strength making them well suited for these tasks.\n\nOffered freedom if they completed 10 years of service, many orcs went to sea for the chance to escape bondage and proved themselves to be capable sailors, becoming indispensable for Nathalairey naval operations in the mid 16th century."

Finally completed in 1689, the Silnath Opera was considerd a masterwork of architecture, combining elements of Neo-Damerian and Bulwari styles that gave it a unique and instantly recognizable look.

In 5848 BA, the holds of the Middle Dwarovar reforged the fabled alliance in response to the fall of Amldihr to the orcs and the proclamation of the Jade Empire by Grônstunad. The holds were equal partners, expected to aid each other against the attacks of orcs in the west and the imperialistic Jade Empire along with goblin raids to the east.\n\nAs this second Segbandal consolidated its power and defeated countless threats to its survival, it grew in wealth and power, reaching a golden age in the midst of the West's fall.

Its recruits mostly consisted of dwarven exiles from the Segbandal or Ovdal Tûngr, but sometimes included human warriors liberated from slavery.\n\nTheir efforts greatly reduced Gnollish influence in Bulwar, but the Seg Band found itself overmatched during the invasion of the Great Xhaz.

The Dwarves came to the human's aid 16,000 strong, 3,000 from each hold and 1,000 of the Dauvek Veker of Gor Vazumbrog, led by Krummul Orcslayer himself.\n\nOn the field before Eduz-Vacyn he delivered a famous vow to them, promising to slay every orc in their lands and to teach them the superior dwarven craft of both stone and metal and to foster good relations among each other.

With one final teleportation spell in Gor Dûrgheled, the Runefather and his followers found themselves stranded in the Primeval Serpentdepths; what should have been a proverbial death sentence was instead weathered during the Harrowing Times through the Runefather's guidance.\n\nIt was during this time that the Runefather, beset by a spiritual malaise, gave in to the rancour and bitterness of his followers. He nurtured their nascent hatred and forged them anew into a cold, calculating weapon hellbent on righting past wrongs and achieving vengeance against those that dared to banish him; thus the Obsidian Dwarves were reborn by their eternal resentment."

As it was founded by exiles and criminals, Krakdhûmvror had very few strong clans in its early days. Instead of positions being determined by bloodlines or clans, Krakdhûmvror favors those with individual talent, which has resulted in a far less rigid hierarchy than most other holds. Even those of the most humble of upbringings can rise to the top, and nepotism is all but sacrilegious in the frozen halls of power.\n\nBecause of this, Krakdhûmvror has enjoyed an innovative and flexible administration for much of its existence. Many a time a disgraced scion of a royal clan fled to Krakdhûmvror demanding status and position, based on little more than their parentage, and all were told the same thing: 'Zaru ubr Bloth', Skill over Blood."

This is not without purpose; due to its origin as an expanded fort, every building in Krakdhûmvror is first and foremost dedicated to defence and survival. Even the smallest hovel is built to serve as a fortress unto itself.

From weapons that give enemies frostbite and arrows that shatter into shrapnel on impact, to armour that can 'unfreeze' and flow back together, the potential applications of Ice-Steel are widespread.\n\nWhile the production of the hold's signature steel has over the centuries declined, Ice-Steel armaments are nonetheless common enough that well-off soldiers have at least one weapon or piece of armour made of it, making the Frozenforge Hall's armies a glacial wall of unbending steel and death."

Originally built to protect Dwarovar against the Ice Giants of yore and manned by exiles and criminals banished from the rest of Dwarovar, it became a derelict outpost after the giants' civilisation fell thousands of years ago and was eventually expanded to a hold. As the last outpost of Aul-Dwarov, isolated in the Giants Anvil mountains and disconnected from the Dwarovrod network, the only people who arrived to make a new life for themselves in the hold were those unwanted elsewhere in Dwarovar or those trying to escape their past. This led to the outpost developing a reputation for a solitary culture, and having very little interaction with the outside world.\n\nAt least, until the emergence of the orcs. As the holds of Western Serpentspine fell, refugees began to pour to the hold from Amldihr, Orlazam-az-dihr, and Dûr-Vazhatun, desperate for safety from the orcish menace. The rapid expansion of the hold's population forced the dwarves to work with what little resources they had to expand the hold's defences, living quarters, and infrastructure to accommodate a vastly larger population in a relatively short period of time. While this event took place ages ago, the dwarves of the Frozen Hold of Krakdhûmvror still retain the lessons of those days to this day, allowing them to easily integrate foreigners and expand the hold's infrastructure to account for the needs of the people."

It takes the most tenacious and determined people to work together in order to survive in as unforgiving an environment as Giant's Anvil, and centuries of hardships and struggle for survival have led to the dwarves of Krakdhûmvror becoming as unyielding as the quartz they get their name from.

They were not the first to Escann however, as some refugees from Ovdal Asra had settled there millennia past.\n\nThe dwarves ended up settling and working in the land of Cannor and with the arrival of the legendary Balgar the Builder, built most of Castonath and later, his many other wonders."

There he recovered a pink agate, the Gem of Asra, one of the gems of the Dwarovkron, as well as many other riches to bring back to the surface. He however did not reclaim the Gem of Asra alone.\n\nHe did so with the help of the legendary adventurers Jaerel the Mistwalker, Mintbrick Puddlebonk, and Gerin Orcrend. Sadly, with conflict in the hold against the orc Dugorik Dragonbreaker and his early Greentide host, the hold collapsed further as the party awoke old golems to defeat the orcs. That heroic deed brought Fognir and his line into legend, and delayed Khugdihr's eventual defeat to a decade later."

This allowed them to deploy and test strategies new and old, and to constantly refine and tweak the conduct and practices of the armed forces.

As a young, starry-eyed man, the last king of Hul-Jorkad was said to have spent his life searching for the ritual in which he might turn our lead to gold. Soon enough, though, he was afflicted with intense greed and obsession with wealth, and his goal discarded. Only his fixation on gold remained. It's long been said that Hul-Jorkad might have held, had he not embezzled and hoarded the funds that would've armed the soldiers on the fateful day of the hold's fall, or even that the orcs were sent as a punishment, for a greedy, unfit ruler whose lust for gold had spread to his people, fracturing the hold at every level."

While historically meltwater from the peaks fed through the aqueducts of Hul-Jorkad was enough to maintain the hold, that supply had become nearly insufficient.\n\nMeanwhile, the lake was filled with the life of many fish and edible plants that would provide the Lead Dwarves with food variety envied by the deeper holds. First with simple water wheels along the river's run, and ultimately with the towering mechanical water pumps, the water brought up into Hul-Jorkad would be enough for its people and to sell to every stretch of the Serpentspine beyond.

It would be from here, that the Titanium Dwarves attempted the three great Segbandalic Expeditions, attempting to reclaim Hul-Jorkad and Verkal Kozenad.\n\nIn addition to the many attempts at reclamation, the Titanium Dwarves also stood stalwart against the endless black tides from the west, the orcs breaking on their walls time and time again.

Taking on those tasks too big or dangerous for other dwarves to handle, the Dauvek Veker were notoriously fervent, dangerous, and daring.\n\nTo join the order, one needed to prove themselves not against mere goblins or orcs, but a great beast of the depths - the Purple Worm was the preferred hunt target for most. As years went on, and supply lines became restricted, the Dauvek Veker evolved further into renowned weaponsmiths, delving the depths of the Dwarovar for the rare materials needed to create their legendary weapons, such as Krummul Orcslayer's Setzunklufa."

In time, old age did what no other enemy of dwarf-kind could, and Orcslayer became one of only a handful of the Dauvek Veker to die of old age, a fact which is said to have infuriated the great warrior to his last breath."

A great dragon of deepest purple scales, it tunnelled into the hold from its deepest levels, circumventing the Titanium Hold's many defences and killing all who stood in its path. Its corrosive breath ravaged flesh and melted the titanium golems sent against it, while its mere presence maddened and dazed the dwarves that it came upon.\n\nThe beast killed tens of thousands before the General-King admitted the hold could not be saved. Sending the remaining Titanium Guardians against the dragon in a desperate bid to buy time, the King ordered an abandonment of the lower levels and began to organise the total evacuation of all dwarves in Vazumbrog. While the refugees fled to the other holds of the Segbandal and prepared to regroup and retake their home, the dragon settled into its new home.\n\nThe bottom levels of the hold soon became saturated with gaseous poison, which mixed with the virulent magices of the innumerable cursed artifacts in the deep vaults to create The Dragon's Wound, a glowing purple miasma that leeched the spirit and melted the flesh, a permanent stain on reality commemorating the tragedy and hubris of the Titanium Hold."

As they died, the collective dream of the magically connected dwarven minds was unleashed into the mortal world, and the Dream of Vengeance was born. Its powerful magic shattered the goblins' minds with hallucinations and visions, breaking apart friendships and families and leading to a great mistrust between once allies.

These ghosts ranged from evil spirits spewing curses and insults to those that woke them to the saddest stories of lone defenders repelling their invaders, but all of their multitude of stories were recorded in sacred tomes kept by the hold.

Drawing on their many connections to the other clans, they called a council in Elynayle, to which Clan Myna and the precocious young queen Narawen of the Drennen responded.

But, upon his defeat by the orcs, the secret of Oubblig’s success was revealed. He committed the greatest sin of all Forest Goblins for power; he had made a pact with the Fey.\n\nWhen the truth came out, it was one of our own who confronted Oubblig. Our nameless hero could not kill Oubblig, puppet of the Fey, but they did maim him. And that was enough. Soon, as one clan, we ousted him and his wretched followers.

 squatter_life_under_the_sun_desc:0 "For untold centuries we have lived within the sprawling caverns of the Dwarovar. If our people ever knew what sunlight is, we have long since forgotten. This ensures that our people are well adapted to living within the lightless caverns of this endless expanse."
 squatter_infrastructure:0 "Squatter Infrastructure"
 squatter_infrastructure_desc:0 "Once the Dwarovar fell, the availability of resources declined as well. We have learned to live amidst the ruins of this once great empire. We will never want for material so long as we continue scavenging among the remains of the Dwarf's fallen empire; this ensures our settlements are opulent compared to others of our kind amidst the ruins."

 squatter_taking_what_is_ours_desc:0 "By right of conquest, all of the Dwarovar is ours. No matter what these interlopes may think, the mountains are no longer theirs.

 squatter_the_dwarovar_toll_desc:0 "As our realm continues to expand into the far reaches of the Dwarovar, we have begun to enthrall various tribes and adventurer bands. To all of these groups we extend the simple choice: pay us a tribute due, or face extermination. This ensures that those wise enough to see the wisdom of our offer are more likely to remain loyal and contribute resources to our cause."

 warband_zeal_desc:0 "With strength comes respect. All in our warband know that if the warchief commands something be done then there is no room for questioning. Many a time have we thrown ourselves upon the battlements of a hold or waded amidst the bodies of our enemies to see the warchiefs will be done. No matter the situation, we ensure that nothing shall challenge our zeal. Let the Warchief's will be done lest our honour fail!"
 warband_settlement:0 "Warband Settlement"
 warband_settlement_desc:0 "We have come to see the value of settling in one place. Unlike our cousins, we no longer see the need to roam the barren roads and caverns of this fallen land. Instead we settle amid the ruins of a long fallen hold and build amidst the detritus. As a result, we continue to achieve levels of settlement previously unthought of for our kind."

 warband_domination_desc:0 "Unlike the disorganized bands of our kind scattered across the Dwarovar, we respect authority above all else. Those with the strength to rule are respected, because should they ever weaken they will be replaced in due time. The level of organization this confers allows us to dominate the lesser of our kinds for whatever ends we please."

 warband_cavern_agriculture:0 "Cavern Agriculture"
 warband_cavern_agriculture_desc:0 "Our time spent in the caverns of the Dwarovar has exposed us to a multitude of flora and fauna likely unknown to the dwarves of old.

 I45_the_grand_opening_desc:0 "Our time in isolation has seen the world change drastically from when our ancestors first entered the shadowed boughs of the Deepwoods. Though we have managed to set aside our petty squabbles and unite, we find ourselves still under threat. We shall open the Deepwoods to the peoples of Cannor so that we might learn from their wisdom lest we stay stuck in our backwards ways and find ourselves threatened beyond our ability to defend."
 I45_the_green_palace:0 "The Green Palace"
 I45_the_green_palace_desc:0 "We have always been a divided people, more prone to tribal or familial loyalties than to any sense of national identity. The invasion of the Deepwoods by the orcish brutes changed that. Our division allowed them to run rampant, ruining the equilibrium of our home and threatening our relationship with the Fey. Now that we have driven out these beasts, and the Verdant Pact has coalesced into a true union of the tribes, we must build a palace truly befitting the High King of the Deepwoods."

 I45_a_bow_in_every_home_desc:0 "During the orcish onslaught, our people quickly learned that just as the darkened woodscape veiled us from the world, so too for the greenskins as well. Battles were often swift and brutal and those found unprepared were slaughtered by the invaders. This lesson taught that laxity rests as the worst of sins, for only through preparedness were we able to throw back the orcish tide and save our precious homeland. Should any other threat arise either within or beyond our borders they will find that the once disparate people of Deepwoods are prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend their homeland."

 I45_one_people_one_country_desc:0 "The Greentide beset upon us with a ferocious savagery and those tribes who were too stubborn to join the Verdant Pact found themselves annihilated. Now that the wars have ceased and our homeland is no longer under threat, there are some who mutter about a desire to return to the old ways. However, most have come to see the value of solidarity and realize that the Deepwoods cannot insulate us from the world as it has done in the past. We must become as one people, all willing to sacrifice for our adopted home lest the tides of change sweep us away."

 I45_between_branches_and_leaves_desc:0 "Even in times of peace our people inadvertently prepare for war, for use of the longbow is as much a matter of daily survival as it is for battle. Even the least skilled among us are capable to wielding our ancestral weapon to deadly effect. In times past we would answer the calls of the so often capricious fey and ride to war for some elusive ends. Many of the peoples who borders the Deepwoods still have folk stories warning children that if they misbehave then the fey-folk will steal them away in their sleep. Though it has been centuries, the Escanni saying that it is easier to shoot an arrow through branches and leaves than it is to please the Gods hearkens back to a time when such raids were common. The precision of our ancestors skill continues on to this day."
 I45_the_oak_gift:0 "The Oak Gift"
 I45_the_oak_gift_desc:0 "Although the Deepwoods and the fey who inhabit them appear fickle by nature, our ancestors were able to see the pattern of balance underlying all things. From this came our role as stewards and servants of this misunderstood land. Though the woods are just as likely to be bereft of bounty we know that this simply hearkens to a time to come when such things will overflow. Our ability to identify this natural cycle ensures that we never want for goods that we need because we strive to never disrupt the equilibrium of the woods."

 I45_the_eyes_of_the_forest_desc:0 "Though many of our kind have left the safety and comfort of the Deepwoods since their opening hoping to find a better life across Cannor, many of them are actually Eyes of the Forest, sent forth by the High King at the bidding of the fey. They aim to understand the world around us and ensure that a threat like the Greentide is never able to catch our peoples unaware again. The fact that many peoples have an attitude of ingrained dismissiveness towards our kind only makes this task easier; no suspects that beneath the downtrodden visage of a sapling lies the hardened mind of an Eye."

 I46_shared_dream_desc:0 "Long ago, before orcs or even elves settled in Deepwoods, these fey forests covered half of Cannor and were home to a wide variety of magical creatures, including centaurs. The ancient human king Castan II Beastbane destroyed a significant portion of the Feywoods, leaving only the Deepwoods as a small remnant of former glory. But humanity's greatest sin was burning the World Tree to ashes. The goal of the Emerald Orcs is simple - become a weapon of vengeance for fey-kind, take these lands back and clear them of human conquerors."
 I46_wrath_of_nature:0 "Wrath of Nature"
 I46_wrath_of_nature_desc:0 "For many centuries Fey were persecuted by humans. They lost their lands and many were killed or exiled. While most of the Fey did not care, preferring to live in a never-ending cycle of feasts and holidays, a small faction of fey still remembered how humans humiliated and insulted them.\n\nThis faction of Fey called themselves the Ashentree Pact, named after the World Ashentree. These Fey hoped that Wood Elves, who were lured into these woods around 1000 AA could be used for their goals, but the Wood Elves turned out to be resistant to their magic and weren't interested in war with humans. Disappointed, the Ashentree Pact decided to wait for another chance, finally seeing their opportunity in the orcs which recently invaded the Deepwoods. With enhancements from fey magic orcs could be unbeatable in battle."
 I46_legacy_of_the_greentide:0 "Legacy of the Greentide"
 I46_legacy_of_the_greentide_desc:0 "During the Greentide a great number of orcish clans invaded the Deepwoods. Some of them were quite well-known among orcdom and had proven their worth during the Greentide. The Cursed Howl Clan were lead by one of the most renowned orcish warlords, Gordak. His clan sacked Bladekeep and the dreadful howls they performed during the pillage had given them their name. The Blackmoon Clan on the other side was famous for their battle shamans, who unleashed their magical power on the armies of humans and dwarves. The Silentblade Clan was considered somewhat dishonorable by other orcs, but they excelled in guerrilla combat, using ambushes to defeat their foes. And all of them are now part of the Emerald Horde, which now benefits greatly from their experience."

 I46_loyal_to_our_queen_desc:0 "The Emerald Horde is lead by the Warchief and his Queen. The Queen is always a Fey which has agreed to enter into marriage with a mortal orc and share part of her power with him, giving him incredible magical potency. They can not do so normally, but Emerald Orcs have consumed water from the Feyrealm and are attuned to fey magic and influence."

 I46_fey_courtiers_desc:0 "Fey may be not be useful when it comes to the clash of armies, but they can give us a good hand in administrating land conquered by the Emerald Horde. While they might be chaotic and absent-minded, their abilities as advisors are impressive."
 I46_warlock_kings:0 "Warlock Kings"
 I46_warlock_kings_desc:0 "Emerald Orcs exchanged their free will for fey power, granting us a bevy of benefits. Aside from skin changes, we've become attuned to nature and many of us are capable of becoming powerful druids and rangers. But warlocks of powerful fey are the true elite of Emerald Horde society. They are the only ones who can become the leaders and rulers of the Horde, making them the first Witch-Kings in the modern era."
 I46_defenders_of_tugund_darakh:0 "Defenders of Tugund-Darakh"
 I46_defenders_of_tugund_darakh_desc:0 "For many years, the High Warlocks of Tugund-Darakh, the land of a Thousand Trees, have enhanced their people with magic and artifacts from the Feyrealm. Their skin is now as hard as bark and provides great defence from regular weapons and firearms, while the inherent orcish strength was pushed even further, making them as strong as ogres. All these gifts were given to help orcs crush the human and orc realms in Cannor and plant a new Deepwoods in their place. It is our desire that the World Tree may be revived and, hopefully, emerald orcs will be accepted as full-fledged fey and be allowed to enter the Feyrealm, the Plane of Life and Magic, where fey hold their eternal feasts."

 Z54_anti_fey_politics:0 "Anti-Fey Politics"
 Z54_anti_fey_politics_desc:0 "The War of the Black Trees is a terrible scar in the history of orcs in the Deepwoods. Corrupting one's mind and will is an unforgivable crime of fey, as well as forcing orcs to fight in their place. We did not mind fey as long as they lived in deepest forests and did not interact with us, but it seems fey do not appreciate good will towards them. All fey must be enslaved and put under control by our warriors. Any resistance from their kind should be crushed without hesitation or sympathy."
 Z54_reforge_deepwoods:0 "Reforge the Deepwoods"
 Z54_reforge_deepwoods_desc:0 "Nature is an untamed beast and the Deepwoods are the essence of nature. It is cruel and unforgiving and only the strongest can survive here. But the strongest can break and remake nature as they see fit. Our people proved their strength in the War of the Black Trees and created a new nation which shall be a safe haven for all orcs in the Deepwoods, the land of the Black Trees.

Though he was just the youngest son of high shaman of the Blackmoon clan, his power was far greater than any of his siblings. He sensed the malicious intent of the Deepwoods spirits, and tried to convince his father to take action before the fey attacked them, but his father was reluctant to take action and let the War of the Black Trees begin. After that an enraged Bron challenged his father to duel for the title of high shaman and murdered him without hesitation. He assembled all uncorrupted shamans and collectively they used their magecraft to create the Black Hearth which turned the tides of war in their favor. Bron's importance to Karakhanbar creation is undeniable, and he could be treated as one of the founders of the Orcish state in the Deepwoods."

The Boek are known for their bravery and many aspire to be like the Braves of the Lenef whose job it is to fight off the Cheshoshi to the south, performing great feats of daring and bravery to prove themselves.

 G01_reunite_the_bo_desc:0 "The name Boek, is one of deep meaning to our people, consisting of two words ‘Ek', meaning 'people of' or 'tribe' and ‘Bo'. To an outsider bravery would seem to be the defining trait of Boek people, and it is a common misconception that the word ‘Bo' means warrior. The Sadih know this is not the case.\n\nIt is said that long ago, before the people of the Boek arrived in this land, they were united as a single tribe under a female chieftain named Imar'el. They lived as one and their bond was unbreakable.\n\nWhile it may seem that time has broken this bond, the Sadih have proven this not to be the case. With skilled diplomacy they were able to re-kindle our lost kinship, uniting our disparate tribes into a single entity. It is for this reason that, of all the tribes of the Trollsbay, only we may claim the mantle of the Boek; for ‘Bo' does not mean warrior. ‘Bo' means brother."

However, even amongst the Bo tribe one stands above all: Evn'do.\n\nFamous for his expeditions into the Cheshoshi territories, having pushed them out of the Eastern coastline of the Trollsbay, Evn'do was a renowned adventurer and warrior amongst the Boek. However, his expeditions against the Cheshoshi pale in comparison to his exploits later in life.\n\nIn 1584 an elf named Torrieth passed through our tribe with a small expedition they were seeking the centre of an ancient civilization that they claimed had once ruled over this continent. They sought to hire a guide from our tribe and, naturally, Evn'do volunteered.\n\nEvn'do returned 2 years later and brought with him both great treasures and great tales inspiring a new generation of adventurers in our tribe who go out in search of ancient treasures."

Over time the lands of the Boek tribes were reduced until, finally, they reached the cliffs.\n\nWith the cliffs on one side, and the Cannorians on the other the Boek were effectively trapped, and so were left with only one recourse: to fight.\n\nTaking their stand in Sakti, the remaining Boek faced a Cannorian force marching from Fort Thorn who sought to bring an end the Boek. With their backs to the cliffs it was clear to the Boek that there would be no surrender, and they fought with a previously unseen ferocity. The Braves, living up to their name, charged, with disregard for their own lives, headlong into the Cannorian muskets. Refusing to give up what little they had left the Braves pushed on through the gunfire, with each Brave taking as many as 6 shots to bring down.\n\nBut it was not enough; no amount of bravery could make up for the technological disparity between the settlers and the Boek and they were slaughtered to the last.\n\nIn the end it seems the Lenef were proven correct: there is more to war than mere bravery.“ – Excerpt from The Last Stand of the Braves."

Constructing within the trees of the forest we use their trunks and branches as supports elevating our homes high above the ground with our people living in concealed structures within the canopy. While this practice may seem unnatural to our peers, and even to some within our own tribe, this innovative design serves a very practical purpose: by building within the trees the Yan tribe is better able to make use of the space within the forest and protects the tribe from the monsters that prowl the forest floor."

Capable of killing a brave with a single swipe a small pack of Bloodfeeders can certainly present a serious threat to an unprepared force.

As our tribe grows however the prospect of moving our entire tribe becomes a daunting one, and so have been forced to adapt. Rather than fleeing from the Bloodfrenzy, we will fight it, but on our terms.

Soon, though, our scouts found the source of this great terror. Strange folk so much like ourselves, yet so different. They cut down our scouts with the same emotionless precision as they offered the Bloodfeeders.\n\nSo it was for years, that we skirmished with these 'elves'. Though we could scarcely capture them, for the ferocity they offered, what little we could gleam was that they wished to kill all who walk upon the world, save for their own kin. So it was, for a time, our dwellings pushed from the forest that was our home, our trees aflame as we found ourselves set against this great enemy.\n\nBut we were not alone in our fight. A strange short-eared folk followed who too came from across the seas but were embroiled in battle with the elves. Whilst at first we had distrusted these people it became clear we could not stand alone and our braves joined with theirs becoming their brothers in battle, standing at our side, along with many others. It was not short, it was not simple, but soon enough, we had pushed the callous elves of this Aelnar into the sea once more."

Furthermore many members of our tribe have been found alive but with two puncture marks on their neck, but with no memory of the night before.\n\nA thorough investigation by our priests and braves lead us to the answer to this mystery. With the settlers came a new breed of Bloodfeeder, one capable of disguising itself as a person, tricking our people into following them away from the tribe where they are drained of blood.\n\nOur braves have become adept at hunting and killing these creatures. Unlike their Bloodfeeder brethren they are vulnerable to sunlight and bound to a single location that, once destroyed, can eliminate the creature permanently. This skill seems to be one that is in high demand with the settlers and our braves are often hired to hunt down and kill these creatures."

A small force of our Braves awaited them, weapons at the ready. They marched to face us, and found themselves sinking, having walked into a concealed bog. But they pressed on, towards the mound where our warrior awaited them, their fate sealed.\n\nThe signal was given.\n\nOur warriors arose from the depths where they had concealed themselves.

That changed when we told them of the vast ocean beyond the cliffs astonished they lead our expedition to the local chief Seronval asking endless questions about the bay and yet strangely disregarding our warnings.\n\nUpon our arrival their chief granted our tribe many gifts, most notable of all was the necklace granted to Tewalari, our chief, before his departure, and its striking resemblance to the artifact granted to us by the heavens.

 G42_ynnsmouth_settlement_desc:0 "Whilst the Inek had nominally settled Ynnsmouth, the settlement was never a large one, likely due to the Inek's fear of the seas, and the Kuukuswlaws lurking in the bay. The Cannorians had no such fears and were more than happy to settle along the coast, however none settled Ynnsmouth, likely due to both the Inek Braves who would attack any colonists and a deeper, instinctive, feeling that Ynnsmouth should be avoided.\n\nThe first permanent Cannorian settlement in Ynnsmouth was founded as late as 1673 by a small group of settlers from Busilar, having fled the country due to conflicts over the continued worship of certain Regent Court deities by the populace. Following the foundation of this settlement the Inek found themselves drawn towards the coast, expanding the Inek settlement and eventually absorbing the Busilari settlement. Ynnsmouth grew to become a major trading hub due its prime position at the mouth of the Ynn. Most traders do not stay for long."

Disregarding its strictness, it was a well run and advanced system of labor and resource management, invented to ensure all contributed their dues to ensure the survival of the settlement. This system was abandoned over time, as the need for it disappeared with the reestablishment of trade links to the rest of the world.\n\nAs our consolidation of Taychend continues, many of our officials have begun to look to the past for inspiration to solve our current issues with the Taychendi not cooperating.

The lingering resentment and occasional rebellion against the monarchy has led to the need to create a new force designed specifically to combat this ever present threat: The Krypharpedan.\n\nRecruited from amongst the most loyal of Klereyen, they actively hunt the republican resistance. Especially active in the Devand and in the kheions, they are the shield that keeps the royal familly, and Nákyra as a whole, safe from both domestic and foreign attack."

Many local leaders organised resistance against our rule, which weakened our control over the conquered lands. In response we hunted them down and executed them. We ensured that they were replaced with weaker willed locals. These meek rulers would lead by example. Under the watchful eye of hobgoblin garrisons they greatly weakened any resistance to our rule. It was through these strict measures that newly conquered peoples and lands could be quickly incorporated into our Great Command as we marched upon Haless."

 hobgoblin_modern_drill_techniques_desc:0 "Through many generations we have developed traditional techniques of drilling our armies. While these techniques had been adequate for border protection and the conquest of the Jade Mines, our expansion into northern Haless introduced us to several new enemies. This kick-started the development of modernised drills. The two main drills were those developed by the Wolf Command, which centered around cavalry flanking maneuvers, and those developed by the Boar command, which centered around massed infantry. The latter of the two would prove a very effective baseline for later firearm drills."

 hobgoblin_warforged_culture_desc:0 "Constant warfare both within and outside of the Jade Mines has pushed hobgoblin society into ever greater centralisation and militarisation in the form of various Commands, culminating in the founding of the Great Command in 1391 AA. This has led to hobgoblin society becoming an incredibly well oiled machine capable of supplying vast armies with extreme efficiency, with almost every household capable of producing weapons, uniforms and soldiers for the Great Command’s endless campaigns. This has resulted in a civil society that is completely integrated into the purpose of the state: War."

No good hobgoblin would even consider betraying their duty to their family and Command and lose their honour. A hobgoblin without honour loses their family, their position, their very place in society. They are removed from all the things that give meaning to life and thus often end up with two options, suicide or exile. Suicide is the preferred choice for those who have dishonoured themselves, for such is the weight of our honour. No secrets are spilled."

This led to the creation and steady expansion of the Ninyu Kikun, the combined army, which answered only to the Grand Marshal. This force would systematically recruit the most disciplined soldiers and most accomplished commanders into the service of the Grand Marshal, eventually forming the most formidable army of the Command. The Ninyu Kikun would be the first of the armies to adopt artillery into their formations, crushing enemy defences and opposition while paving the way for the artillery innovations of the Dragon Command. The existence of the Ninyu Kikun also served to increase the authority and control of the Grand Marshal within the military structures of the Command and by extension their authority over the lesser Marshals."

 hobgoblin_military_education_desc:0 "Hobgoblin military education begins in the family, with grandfathers and fathers beginning the process of passing down their martial skills to their sons from the age of 8. Years of training from a young age form the foundation that a young hobgoblin builds upon through their introduction into larger military divisions, such as a senun, banner, or ten, regiment. It is here that a hobgoblin has the opportunity to distinguish themselves on the battlefield, potentially earning an exaltation from a superior officer. A hobgoblin soldier who earns themselves an exaltation is given an advanced military education and promoted to captain, regardless of their clan’s status. The system of exaltations ensures that the officer corps of the Command has greater pools of talents to draw upon than most states on Halann and prevents the elite clans from monopolising leadership positions."
 hobgoblin_direct_control:0 "The Six Command System"
 hobgoblin_direct_control_desc:0 "Our expansion outside of Shamakhad began to strain the administration due to the lack of loyal and honourable hobgoblins to govern our newly conquered lands. This led to our Grand Marshal dividing the three original Commands into the Tiger, Elephant and Dragon commands, who would found war camps and settle in the lands outside of Shamakhad. The influx of our people into the distant territories allowed for the expansion and spread of hobgoblin garrisons, easing the pressure on our central administration and ensuring that our Great Command could govern the dishonourable peoples of Haless with greater efficiency than before."

While under gnollish rule, this art was mostly lost, and it didn't regain much of its former glory while under the sun elves. In Dartaxâgerdim, the old art was revived and an arcane society rose to prominence and now flourishes all over Bulwar."

Among his most famous works, the poem that would become known as The Flower Oath began 'On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.'\n\nMany see a message in these words - a message of ambition, longing, and surety.

Though it has fallen into disrepair in recent years due to the conflict raging in northern Rahen, the Sojourner's Road and Tilathi remain sacred places of great beauty worthy of restoration and protection.

While this decree was unquestioned by many in South Rahen, in Tiltaghar the distance from the centers of political gravity meant that the reform never took as firm of a hold.\n\nThroughout the history of the Northern Senapti, humans proved their valor, skill, and intelligence, and the attitudes of the harimari rulers of Tiltaghar changed to become far more accepting of working with, instead of ruling over, humans over the years. This culminated in the 1601 Edict of Tiltaghar, issued shortly after the collapse of the Dhenijanraj's central authority, and decreed that the highest castes would no longer be forbidden to humans, who would henceforth be equal partners in the land of the Tiger Ziggurat."

The late Raja’s principle advisor, Goshar of the Golden Paw, Prabhi of Amtujsaat, stepped in as regent to the infant prince and served as de-facto ruler of the Raj for 23 years, raising the prince to be a capable ruler and handing power to him when Shurapalar turned 25.\n\nIn his stewardship of the state, Grand Vizier Goshar was known for his masterful and gentle hand, convincing many to follow the throne with perfectly selected arguments and, when those failed, political assassinations, rather than open warfare.

It is estimated that 100,000 soldiers and a quarter million civilians died over the course of the struggle, and the legitimacy of the throne in Dhenijansar was badly degraded. Worse still, 25 years of civil war had allowed the armies of the Jaddari to gain a foothold on the Southwestern Coast, The Command to cross the Kharunyana and seize Pordhatti and Sarnavan, and Bhuvauri to invade the Ascension Peninsula and topple the Senapti of Rabaghekhur.

As the Jaddari armies advanced, many of the prabhi surrendered and swore fealty to the Desert Elves directly, and soon a large swathe of lower Rahen was controlled by the invaders.\n\nAfter failing to halt the advance of the Jaddite Army at Rhamirta, the reeling lords of Amtujsaat turned to their southern neighbor, the Senapti of Tujgal, for protection. Offering their fealty to the White Tiger of the Jungles in exchange for protection, Amtujsaat and their fellow prabhi of Umdaj and Parus Panasur became vassals of Tujgal, who proclaimed the formation of a new realm, separate from the old Raj and based in the unified and centralized jungles of the Ascension Peninsula - the Kingdom of Vanrahar."

But our adherence to the Radiant Sun school of High Philosophy had made the message of the Jadd particularly compelling to our Senapti and many of our warriors, and the ever-ambitious lords of Rabhidaraj sensed an opportunity. Secret talks were initiated with the Jaddari, to betray the Raja and join our realm to theirs - in return, we would convert to the Jadd and join them as equal partners in empire.\n\nWhen the forces of the Dhenijanraj met the Jaddari at the Battle of Ghamakrit, the Rabhidaraji held the right flank as always - but at a critical moment in the battle, we withdrew and exposed the Raja's center, allowing them to be crushed by the Jaddari cavalry. With the army broken, we marched alongside the Jaddari to the gates of Dhenijansar and threw down the walls for our new brothers in the faith. Thus, by the treason of Rabhidaraj did the Jaddari gain their dominance over lower Rahen - and we obtained our central place as governors and administrators in their growing realm, sculpting policy from within as willing partners instead of subjugated serfs."

The ideas that travel down the Golden Highway, that come ashore at Sramaya, will not stop just because we wish them to.

Because of this, in the months and years that would follow the fall of the Jadd Empire, Rabhidaraj would establish itself as a power player in the emerging Deioderan polities that would dominate Rahen for the next half-century."

The territory traded hands a dozen times until Ramapalar the Reunifier conquered Dhujat in 1306 AA. The great Raja settled the dispute by splitting the land equally betwen ourselves, our ancient rivals, and the Royal throne.\n\nFor many years this dissatisfactory status quo held, with verdant Maharaaja split in three, and Endhuvi waited, patient, for her opportunity to finally take her rightful land. In many ways, the waiting came to be more important than the land itself - for while the plains would eventually be reclaimed, fought over, and lost again, the standoff would come to characterise the Rasarhid people of Endhuvi.

The cause was soon made apparent when an enormous catfish, its scales glittering every color of the rainbow, emerged from the mud of the river, its tail-strikes shaking the earth.

Invariably, he was drawn home as his adventures imparted him with ever more wisdom about the High Gods and how a human is supposed to act. By the time he returned to the land of his birth, he had been completely forgotten, but his wisdom earned him the status of king that he once so feared and loathed."

Crossings from Bomdan into Dhujat have often come at Keyattordha, where the river narrows enough to ferry soldiers across.\n\nTo prevent easy invasions of their holdings, the lords of Keyattordha have made a long tradition of building fortifications and watchtowers along the riverbank of the Kharunyana at all easy landing points for barges. These fortresses both defend the Raj and serve as customs stops for any who wish to sell their goods, making it easy for Keyattordha to levy taxes on imported goods and pay for the maintenance of these fortifications."

Cannorian diplomats made multiple offers to Keyattordha and her sister cities to purchase the secret of porcelain manufacturing methods, but all were rebuffed.\n\nWhen diplomacy failed, the Cannorians turned to espionage. In 1699, the Lorentish diplomat Celador Rosebloom was arrested in Keyattordha and accused of attempting to steal state secrets. Found guilty and executed despite the formal protest of the Lorentish government, the event led a cabal of Cannorian merchants to seek revenge.\n\nStriking a deal with Bhuvauri, to humble the porcelain cities, secret orders were sent Sramaya to the many Bhuvaurite mercenaries garisonning the cities. Upon receiving them, the soldiers of Keyattordha’s garrison mutinied and sacked the city, destroying its porcelain workshops. Other porcelain cities suffered similar fates in the so-called 'Typhoon of Broken Vases', devastating the economic prosperity of the region for decades."

While they were certainly demanding and unforgiving, life under the Hobgoblins did not differ significantly from life under the Harimari. If one was competent and obeyed the strict laws of The Command, they could rise high in its bureaucracy or military, regardless of their race or caste. This offered a much higher degree of social mobility than many had ever experienced before, and the level of resistance to the occupiers was much lower than outside observers expected.\n\nAs the years went on, and the occupying hobgoblins permanently established control over the upper Kharunyana, they left their mark upon the culture of the human population under their control. Military discipline, honor, and community became ever more important, reshaping the society into what the hobgoblins called the Wuhyun.

The most prodigious writer of this content during the 1500s was a native of Ghundagar, Akshal Bhirala.

The rebellion was initially very successful, and while the lords of Amtujsaat defeated one of the peasant armies, the rebels succeeded in capturing Sardiphadin in 1559.\n\nThis crisis within their own borders forced the Raja to abandon the defensive fortifications at Shenral to deal with the crisis, pulling their armies back and capturing Sardiphadin from the rebels after a 4 month siege. This time away from the borders allowed the Jaddari to advance through the Bloody Pass and put Rayavashapal to siege, the City of Endless Debate falling in early 1560.\n\nWith the lordship of Pasiragha lost, the Raja was forced to appoint a new Senapti to assist them with the war, and careful political maneuvering by Ghundaghar saw them achieve their long awaited goal of becoming Senapti. Their triumph would be short-lived, however, as their own actions had critically weakened the Raj, which would be destroyed only two years later on the plain of Ghamakrit."

Instead of old customs, many young officers and thinkers began calling for a new realm, a complete break with the old system of rajas, prabhi, and senapti, with only one centralized government. This concept, called Vanrahar or "Jungle Paradise", aimed to see our home remade stronger and purer than ever before, no longer divided arbitrarily but instead foremost among the nations of Haless.

All the while, we have been training our soldiers in cavalry tactics that will be vital on the wide open plains of Maharaaja - for when conflict with Endhuvi does come, we know we will meet them in the contested lands, and the charge of our elephants and swiftness of our horses shall sweep the river watchers away once and for all."

Those warriors who settled near the Ruby City brought with them great knowledge of military affairs that would prove invaluable for Parusad Bhola in the difficult wars of the former allies and, later, the Deioderan that would come in the next century."

Efforts by a new cadre of ministers under the young prince Adaraghir helped revitalize Rabaghekhur and turn its focus outwards from the jungles once again, and following the prince's ascension in 1464 Rabaghekhur began to rouse itself from its long period of inactivity and assert itself on the stage of Raheni politics."

These disasters collapsed support for the court of the ineffectual Senapti Bagherad, and soon the majority of the Oghaprabhi were declaring their allegiance to the White Tiger in Tujgal.\n\nFleeing from their ancestral lands, the former Senapti and his loyal retainers made their way across the waves of the Pearl Gulf to Sarhal, where they were well received by those cities who were former members of the Trade League of Sardika.

Once a captain in the Prophecy Guard, Jagaddipendra was a charismatic man and powerful mage, second only to the High Augur of Tughayasa in skill with divination and prophecy.

Using force of arms and Jagaddipendra’s skills of prescience, the various local lords of the west were deposed, and with none left to challenge him Jagaddipendra declared himself King of the Hills and Plains.

Arriving at the city, the captain of the watch demanded that the upstart lord surrender his weapons, but Jagadipendra answered the man with an arrow in the throat. As their captain fell, the defenders launched volleys of arrows at Jagaddipendra, but he stepped calmly between the falling shafts, none so much as scratching him as he returned the defender’s arrows to them. Each found the eye or throat of one of the guards, and soon the walls were silent save for the choking of dying men. With the defenders dead, Jagaddipendra’s forces seized the city and slew the Raja.\n\nWhen news of this display spread, it so shocked the feuding warlords of Rahen that they agreed to an armistice until this terrible mage could be brought to heel.

Meant to conjure the emptiness of the desert in the mind to enable better self-reflection, the Auric Chant is performed by a group of at least five individuals, with two drummers and two flutists accompanied by at least one cantor. The musicians will allow their minds to drift and become still, striking notes that elicit the rustling of wind over sand and the cries of desert wildlife while the cantor provides a low ululating note to center the musicians and any other celebrants that have come to join the group.Famously done without conductors, each variation of the Auric Chant is different, and while considered highly unorthodox by the Golden Palace scholars in Dhenijansar, the local people are fiercely proud of their unique tradition."

Sandranayar lent huge sums of money and soldiers to the Raj in the pursuit of stopping Suhan, ensured that Suhan’s philosophy was not tolerated in his lands, and came very close to capturing the Guru when his entourage passed through the Red Gates of Shenral as they fled to the safety of the coastal cities."

The climate in Taraja is quite different depending on what time of the year you decide to visit - in the winter, the dryness of the air and the winds from the Serpentspine make for a bone-chilling combination, but if one sticks to the riverside and moves steadily westwards, the humidity slowly increases and the weather becomes somewhat more pleasant. One can always choose the desert shortcut that some caravans take, but be warned that the desert can have radically different temperatures between day and night. Once you reach the agricultural town of Ghilakhad, it is advisable to resupply at the prominent caravan destination.\n\nWhen you are ready to move out, head west again and ask for the Phabar mines - the Khedarid are quite helpful when it comes to giving directions. When you reach Phabar, visit the local blacksmith for some decent-quality weaponry, then take the road north and find your way to Maruvad, a province once core to the Great Hobgoblin Command. Here, buy your winter clothing from their excellent wool products, and prepare to make your ascent up the Godswall, for you are close to your goal - the Great Waterfall of Kharunyana, and the lands above it...”\n\nAn excerpt from 'Journey to Nomsyulhan - An Adventurer's Guide' - Arthurian Oldtower, 1755"

Many adventurers are nonetheless eager for new glories in the lands beyond, and so congregate in Khadisrapur to prepare their expeditions into the beyond. These preparations take place at the Maruvad Tower, the great fortress built to guard against incursions both from the unknown plateaus and also against advancing armies from the north, like the hobgoblins that once took Khadisrapur by surprise."

Ramapalar learned from his initial defeat, however, and dealt the lords of Dhugajir a crushing blow the following year, forcing the Black King of Sharaajagal to kneel and place his crown at the Raja’s feet.\n\nSince that humiliation, the Ghavaanaj have had no kings of their own. The ancient capital and heart of Dhugajir, Sharaajagal, is held directly by the harimari, its masters appointed by the Rajas in Dhenijansar. While the decentralization that affected the Raj in the early 1400s led most of the Ghavanaaj to become functionally independent of Sharaajagal, the Tiger Lords of the Elephant’s City still see themselves as rulers of all Dhugajir."

Their house words are a callback to a common folk belief that elephants flee in the presence of mere mice, and are often used as an insult by harimari seeking to disparage the independence of the Ghavaanaj.

The province of Crathánor had few nobles yet many merchants, and thus had few representatives in the government. This meant that the Crathánori had no power to stop the Re-Uyeli nobles from placing heavy tax burdens on them.\n\nAs a result, the merchants began agitating for independence. In 1421 they delivered an ultimatum to the nobility: Give us fair representation, or we will stop paying taxes. This was coldly rejected, and thus Crathánor seceded, adopting a condensed version of the ultimatum as its official motto. This would become the founding principle of the newborn republic."

Only when the dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr came to their aid could the deadlock be broken. But just as the tide had turned, the goblin invasions began in 1423.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the untrained militia fought many desperate battles, winning some and losing many.

It was originally tasked with guarding the eastern border of the Kingdom of Dameria. Its knights were renowned lancers and participated in many tourneys and battles throughout the centuries, their fearsome charges shattering lines of infantry with ease.\n\nEver since the formation of Anbennar, the Order's status and importance diminished. The long years of peace in Anbennar meant that fewer and fewer knights joined it. Yet the Order served Dameria faithfully until the Lilac Wars. During that conflict, Vincen II síl Cestir, the Duke of Cestirande and Grandmaster of the Order, declared independence from Dameria and joined the Rose Party. In 1444 the Lilac Wars were over and the Order was on the winning side, but only thanks to their betrayal of Dameria."

And lastly, they were among the fiercest supporters of the House of Silmuna, but nevertheless sided with the Rose Party in the Fourth Lilac War. This pragmatic yet dishonourable behaviour earned them few friends but many territories. Unfortunately, it did not result in the prettiest of borders."

Perhaps the most infamous such insult was recorded during the Battle of the Moon Council, when Duke Vincen II síl Cestir called Adénn "Skylance" Silmuna "Brokenlance of the Waning Moon".

But opposing them were the Vernmen of Galéinn, who shared their ambition. This rivalry lasted for countless years and showed no signs of stopping after the Lilac Wars.

The Cestirander breed was versatile, sharing traits of both cold-blooded and warm-blooded horses. The Knights of the Long Lance rode on them during tourneys and battles while farmers used them as work horses. As the importance of cavalry on the battlefield diminished, the latter role would become increasingly important, and the horses were crossbred with cold-blooded ones to make them better draft animals. The Cestirander horses would become the engine of local production, plowing fields and hauling freight."

Yet they continued to diminish as technology developed and made lancers obsolete. Members of the order became little more than titleholders or low-ranking officers in the army.\n\nEventually, however, the Order did have its resurgence. The Dukes and Duchesses of Cestirande began to grant the title of knight to court officials and bureaucrats as a reward for exemplary service. This new generation of knights did not wield the lance, but the pen. The burgeoning paper industry of the Duchy's capital, Cestaire, grew to primarily fuel these new knights and their numerous writings."

They were called Glassweavers due to their skill of using magic to create elaborate items from glass, so beautiful and intricate that they were famed well beyond Bisan itself.\n\nWhile the Wexonards do show a colder reception to the elven race, the Counts of Bisan have generally allowed them great autonomy and benefits - either due to Bisan's pro-Damerian leanings, or perhaps coin that fills their coffers."

Their small hands were helpful with the intricacies and allowed corsets to have much smaller lacings. Corsets were fashionable among noblewomen and the demand for high-quality Corseton corsets brought considerable wealth into Bisan.\n\nHowever, there is also a more morbid origin to the city's name. Many know of The Necropolis that dominates the city, which was, for a longest time, the largest temple of Nerat's faith until the Bone Citadel in Aelantir, but only historians know that Nerat was not a god of a pre-Elikhet Kheterata, but was in fact a death god imported by Milcorissian slaves. This fact became widely spread in the 16th century when adventurers uncovered ancient Milcorissian burial grounds in Corseton, containing corpses posed with corsets, leading to the curiously macabre realization that the name for corsets came from corse, an archaic word for corpse."

The hill gnolls were beaten in several decisive battles and Gnollsgate was secured under Bisanese rule.\n\nThus Harold IV earned the title of "Gnollcutter", becoming one of the most famed military leaders of Bisan's history.

However, many remained loyal to Adean, and soon religious tensions erupted between the two groups like they did elsewhere in Cannor. The Bisanese solved the problem like how they usually did, with violence. In the night of 7th of Nerament 1576, the eve of Lansday, the Corinite faithful struck at the Adeanic nobility. The outbreak of assassinations and mob violence resulted in thousands of deaths and crippled the power of the Adeanics, securing Corinite control of Bisan."

The Gisdenese mixed with the new settlers and soon became rather distinct from their other Arannese neighbours, despite still having much in common. This helped with the formation of a distinct Gisdenese identity, which was a combination of Milcorissian and Wexonard traits.

This medicinal knowledge was put to use during the White Pestilence, when the Gisdenese mass produced the cure created by Garion the Wise.

This tradition didn't exist merely among the commoners, but even amongst the half-elven nobility, as foreign dignitaries and visiting monarchs were given the same gift. It was said the Gisdenese were the most friendly folk in the Borders, and most welcoming to strangers. However, violating this hospitality was a quick way to become a despised outlaw."

When the two eventually launched a surprise attack from two directions simultaneously, the Gisdenese defenders fought back valiantly despite being greatly outnumbered. With the support of local farmers and their allies, Gisdenese soldiers waged a brutal guerilla war against the occupiers. While they ultimately failed to repel the invaders and Count Austyn V was deposed, the resistance strengthened Gisdenese identity and led to concessions of local autonomy from the occupiers."

While king Marr believed griffons to be just another pest, Ulric believed that these griffons were essential to protect the nation from another dragon's wrath. He was the first human to train a griffon, and down the line he created the first elite division of griffon cavalry.\n\nIn more recent times, Griffon riders are made up of Marrhold nobles and commonborn knights who had proven their worthiness of riding a griffon with an exceptional act of valor in the battlefield.

The Marrhold militia was able to cross through secret tunnels while the capital was being sieged, and by morning the Blademarcher king found himself cut off from his supply line and surrounded on both sides. The subsequent surrender of the Blademarches shocked all of Cannor, and Marrhold gained immense prestige as a nation 'nigh impossible to siege'.

In the 17th century, however, the grand reopening of the Marrhold tunnel changed and boosted trade between dwarves and humans.

Pits and trenches litter the ruined rails, the relics of attempts at crossing the land before the hold's walls, and such devastated terrain serves as a warning that has resulted in ever fewer invasion attempts over the years .

At the center, linked to the interior of the wall by bands of metal, lies an astonishingly accurate representation of Trialmount, topped with a huge diamond!\n\nBut that is not all, as there are actually two different parts in this masterpiece! Our smiths forged a splendid miniature dragon, and the most talented enchanter of our realm created an invisible magic link between the two parts, so that the dragon can levitate atop the crown! The mighty Silver Dragon of Castanor deploying its wings around Castan's head as he speaks is truly a sight to behold."

 Y52_the_semphrerong_luck_desc:0 "Despite its position, Semphrerong has survived the ages. This is often put down to mere luck, but it is the faith in this luck that carries the Semphrerongi through their life and it is what they put their faith in when they enter into battle.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples of this absurd fortune came in 1699 AA, when the city of Keyattordha executed a Lorentish elf for porcelain espionage. The Cannorian nation bribed the Bhuvauri slave-soldiers manning the cities with exclusive trade rights and a sea of crowns to abandon their contracts with the Porcelain Guild. Many of the cities were sacked amidst the "Typhoon of Broken Vases," as the infamous event became known, but not Semphrerong — it just so happened that the city's porcelain kilns were built directly next to the river gate, so it was a simple matter for the Lorentish to walk in, grab what they needed, and depart. Why the Lorentish force chose not to stay and plunder the city as they had elsewhere is unknown, but none can deny that it was certainly lucky that they didn't."

To surround yourself with those loyal to you yet unafraid to criticize your actions will ensure your exploits are conducted in the most efficient manner possible."
 J49_inhuman_march: "Inhuman March"
 J49_inhuman_march_desc:0 "Insight II: Annihilation\nWar is an unfortunate circumstance that is best left avoided, but when it cannot be, remind yourself who your enemy is, and suffer not any obstacle to their destruction. An army safeguarded from the notions of weather and hunger shall march unimpeded to the very gates of your foes, and cast them to oblivion."

However, none have yet succeeded in opposing it, for they have yet to create a unified force against it."
 J49_defend_secrets: "Defend Our Secrets"
 J49_defend_secrets_desc:0 "Insight V: Secrecy\nKnowledge is one’s greatest asset, and it is something that can rarely be afforded, instead it is gathered with time and effort. A craftsman is not valued for his tools but his expertise. To ensure the knowledge of the state remains valuable, it must be kept secret. Our actions are easily befuddled if one can learn of them in a measly tavern or with a well-placed bribe."
 J49_endless_assault: "Endless Assault"
 J49_endless_assault_desc:0 "Insight VI: Relentlessness\nTo win in conflict, one must simply outlast one’s  opponent.

 J50_new_crown_desc:0 "It has been over a thousand years since any Triunic has worn a crown, and never has one claimed sovereignty over the Zabatlari, Metsamic, and Khamgunai alike. While the common people celebrated their democratic history, many of the nobility have longed for the consistency a monarch brings. Now that we have given them this opportunity, their enthusiasm will be our foundation of strength."
 J50_modern_governance: "Modern Governance"
 J50_modern_governance_desc:0 "While many consider the system of monarchy to be antiquated, to us it represents a new potential for our people. In their commitment to democracy the cities of Sätsare allowed their republics to stagnate into uncompetitive oligarchies, and now we offer a new way forward. When the leadership of the state is known in advance by birthright, those who once squabbled for power can instead devote themselves to the betterment of the nation."
 J50_regal_courts: "Regal Courts"
 J50_regal_courts_desc:0 "While some may consider the process of a ballot effective, it does not come close to the majesty of a royal court. When attempting to get your way diplomatically, it pays to be able to impress foreign diplomats with lavish decorations and appropriate cultural dress. When they return home to deliberate in their sovereign's court, it shall be ours that dwells on their minds."
 J50_zealous_march: "Zealous March"
 J50_zealous_march_desc:0 "It is easier for troops to fight when they know what it is that they fight for. In ages past they fought for survival or for petty strife between cities, out of desperation or obligation. Our men fight for glory, their nation, and the crown. To these higher callings they find pride, and find it easy to send those without such purpose away from the field of battle."
 J50_glorious_reign: "Glorious Reign"
 J50_glorious_reign_desc:0 "To many 'Glory' is hard to define, but they know it when they see it in the fine architecture built by kings past that stands to this day. Despite their previous detestation of monarchy they found pride in the monuments it helped erect, and in this identity the novel crown shall find strength from its distant predecessors."
 J50_loyal_troops: "Loyal Troops"
 J50_loyal_troops_desc:0 "There are few qualities more valuable in a soldier than loyalty. Loyalty is what keeps a fighter fighting for one cause, it is what drives them to stand by their compatriots, and it is what keeps them on the march under our banner. While weapons and tactics are needed for a battle, the loyalty of the soldiers is what wins it."

 J51_yyl_moitsa_lumber_desc:0 "We are situated just a short boat trip away from the massive forests of Yyl Möitsa. While logging operations have been established by the Metsamic cities in the past, they were small and disparate, and would often compete with each other for land and wood. Now that we are united and our dominance over the Blue Sea is secure, operations can finally start in earnest. The entire forest is ours for the taking, and its wood shall be used to build the cabins of our new settlements and the ships that will defend them."
 J51_merchant_families: "Rise of the Merchant Families"
 J51_merchant_families_desc:0 "With our newfound dominance of the seas and exploitation of the forests, we have seen a dramatic increase in the wealth of our merchants. As the houses that pioneered these developments rise in both wealth and influence, and successful merchants establish brand new houses, the families who fail to capitalize on the new opportunities fall into irrelevance."
 J51_cold_north: "Fortress of Wood and Snow"
 J51_cold_north_desc:0 "Yyl Möitsa is a cold and harsh place. While the Kukatodics were exterminated by the stronger ogres and centaurs in the west and south, in the north they were able to use the very forest and winter itself to defend themselves. We should combine this hard-earned wisdom with our knowledge of modern warfare to defend our mainland territories. Our enemies shall find nothing but cold and starvation; even if we have to destroy our own roads, break our own bridges, and torch our own cabins to make it so."
 J51_humble_crown: "Ceremonial Crown"
 J51_humble_crown_desc:0 "While most Triunics see their old monarchs as oppressors and tyrants, we have fonder memories. The people of Vantnhasadma know it was the Oldkings who built their great city from nothing. Stories of the Iron Kings’ strength are still told in Raattakod. The Raven Kings would bravely risk their lives every year for the people of Länkinä. And House Semaas still rules the hearts of Valralahdi centuries after giving up rule of the city itself. But we should never let this fondness make us forget our modern liberties. The king of Möitsakyva has certain ceremonial and administrative rights and duties, but executive control of the state must always lie with our elected officials."
 J51_not_forbidden: "Bridge Between Worlds"
 J51_not_forbidden_desc:0 "For as long as history can remember, the Triunics have been largely isolated from the outside world. Yyl Möitsa, Moduk and the Forbidden Plains were endless walls that separated us from other civilizations. Yet our expansion has made us venture beyond these walls once and for all. Our ships regularly sail all the way to Yanshen, and our pioneers in Yyl Möitsa rub shoulders with both the Cannorians and the emerging kingdoms of the Serpentspine. We have now become the bridge that connects the Triunic Lakes to vastly different ends of the world."
 J51_modern_diplomacy: "Global Diplomacy"
 J51_modern_diplomacy_desc:0 "Compared to our centaur and Kukatodic neighbors, we are the pinnacle of advancement.

 J52_peaceful_frontier_desc:0 "While others seek to tame cold taiga and hot steppe, we have begun to settle a much more pristine land. Several rivers provide routes into the interior, and the relative lack of centaurs enables us to build new homes without risk of a raiding party setting then aflame. While others concern themselves with driving back existential threats, we may focus our attention on mining iron in quantities never known by the Federation."
 J52_civilize_nuzurbokh: "Civilize Nuzurbokh"
 J52_civilize_nuzurbokh_desc:0 "Nuzurbokh, the lands between seas and mountains, held proper civilization before the Centaurs reduced it to ash and drove us to Ianakal. Now that we have returned it is time to resurrect her settlements from their ancient foundations, and make the region more than the backwater it has been rendered by fate."
 J52_workshops_enuuk: "Workshops of Enuuk"
 J52_workshops_enuuk_desc:0 "When the civilization of the Khaashalg collapsed as the skies turned to ash, it was Enuuk who taught us how to rebuild what was lost. Over a millennium of practice the cities surrounding her lake became the most impressive of the Federation, and now as we return to where it began we bring these lessons with us, not only to rebuild, but build better than what came before."
 J52_longbarrel_cannons: "Longbarrel Cannons"
 J52_longbarrel_cannons_desc:0 "As Ianakal lacked a supply of war-worthy iron, what little artillery we could muster was made from bronze, and even then they were smaller than what distant lands could produce. As we find mineral wealth across Nuzurbokh, the potential to build larger cannons opens a new form of warfare to us, one where volleys can be launched from a safe distance and decimate a foe before it can even engage us."
 J52_ancestral_connections: "Ancestral Connections"
 J52_ancestral_connections_desc:0 "The presence of tangible spirits in other regions of Haless has influenced their very way of life. While we have worshiped the Goddess Enuuk, there are many in these lands who do not recognize a divine figure, or only perceive them in connection to the spiritual world. Even our ancestors once worshipped the Supreme Spirit now known as Umon Omi, and some today even consider it the progenitor of Enuuk.\nRegardless of these discrepancies, we have much to learn from the locals of the lands we seek to incorporate into our new nation, and nothing to gain from persecution."
 J52_banking_systems: "Ultakal Minting"
 J52_banking_systems_desc:0 "While Ultakal has produced gold for coinage for over a thousand years, it has never been consistently owned by one state until now. This allows us to establish monetary policy with far more effectiveness than any individual city ever could, for the supply of currency lies exclusively at the state level. With this monopoly, procuring payment for major projects becomes a matter of producing the appropriate coinage and using it to pay laborers."
 J52_new_administration: "Twin Administration"
 J52_new_administration_desc:0 "Not since the Ashen Migration have the Khamgunai been in a state consisting of more than one major city. This fact alone has fostered a need for administrative reform, and it must also be able to manage the less urban lands of Nuzurbokh. To solve both of these problems we have adopted the Dazarnuuk administration, to ensure effectiveness of policy both on the lakes and the interior lands."

While many techniques have since been forgotten, the capacity to recover them has lingered in our blood. With those adventurous at heart joining us to forge a new identity on the plains as the Orachav, it is only a matter of time before the lands belong to us again."
 J53_return_taqoshur: "Old Sun Rising"
 J53_return_taqoshur_desc:0 "While the goddesses of the lakes are closely associated with the Triunics, they were not the first gods worshiped by our people. Inscribed on ruins across the endless grasslands are the rites of our forefathers, and highest among them are those towards Taqoshur, the sun above our heads and the source of all life and civilization.\nWhile it was behind mother Yukel's waves that we bided our time, it is under Taqoshur's glow that we face our destiny head-on."
 J53_mounted_warfare: "Mounted Warfare"
 J53_mounted_warfare_desc:0 "While the forests, hills, and cities of Leloyal inhibited the movements of cavalry, the open steppe demands the free movement only a mount can provide. While we have yet to master this form, you need only look to a pack of centaurs to learn the role of mobility in combat. To have your enemy surrounded is to have effectively won a battle before it has even begun, and to retain the ability to flee from an advancing foe ensures total defeat is an impossibility. Let no Orachav fight with their feet upon the ground, and they will never be vanquished."
 J53_aid_tayoghor: "Aid the Blessed Warrior"
 J53_aid_tayoghor_desc:0 "As we reclaim our own ancestral lands from those that took it from us, the stout inhabitants of the mountains surrounding us have begun to do the same. Tayoghor, a god of such proportions, embodies this desire to protect our lands from that which threaten it, and to enrich ourselves from the bounty of our land. Any who fight against the forces of evil and disaster are a friend to the Orachav, and any skilled warrior can find a home among us."
 J53_well_traveled: "Well Traveled Armies"
 J53_well_traveled_desc:0 "When a lone Orachav travels, knowing how much food to carry can be a matter of life and death, for the nearest supplies could be days away. When a group travels, herd animals may be brought along, but in the haste of war this luxury cannot be afforded. While horses can tilt their necks and feast upon grass at a moment's notice, our men must be prepared for weeks of travel and know how to prepare for it."
 J53_horse_gunners: "Qultiqatish"
 J53_horse_gunners_desc:0 "While the physically stronger centaur has been the master of hectic warfare, the introduction of the firearm has returned the advantage to us. Their charges across the field of battle mean little now that we can drop them dead from a distance, which we can maintain upon our own steeds. While some have learned to fire a bow from atop a horse, the effectiveness of the gun will multiply that technique tenfold."
 J53_adoptive_warfare: "Adoptive Warfare"
 J53_adoptive_warfare_desc:0 "Yerush teaches us that while the lands of the steppe may be consistent, the wars needed to defend it are anything but. When terrain is not limited, the formations of friend and foe alike. The flares and smoke of our fellow men's Budakh Brigades, the endless harassment of a centaur Taryean Raider party, or the Ogrish bulk of an Armed Iklomgemar, we must be prepared to adapt to and vanquish them all."

 I90_ogre_mages:0 "Ogre Magi"
 I90_ogre_mages_desc:0 "Magic has quite a strange effect on Ogres, those that use it gain an insatiable hunger for damestear, the constant consumption of which causes them to undergo a kind of transformation, their skin turns blue, their builds become emaciated, and they adopt a more devious and cunning personality.

To survive, Garsvulshim developed impressive agricultural and irrigation techniques so that they could always maintain a protected food surplus, which also allowed them to endure through periods of scarcity like famine or sieges. However, this only encouraged more raids and more tithes, and launched an arms race of food production, hoarding, and theft. Having endured this for centuries, the clan seethes at every grasping hand that threatens their wealth of food."

When the beast investigates, likely expecting to find a shedding elk or a confused wooly rhinoceros, it finds itself pounced on by the clan member's chosen companions, who lay concealed in the underbrush. \n\nIf they return with gifts of hide and meat and claw, they prove themselves worthy of a proper place in our clan.

With goblin cooperation and vow of servitude without chains, they taught the mossmouth the art of extortion instead of direct raiding.

To this, a companion of the slain King rallied the warriors yet again, saying “When the last Malacnari is slain, then you will rule Malacnar.", and once he was slain his next best companion rose to revolt, and so on and so forth… And while the outcome of the revolt is history, so is the blood we made Vareynn spit."

In a stark contrast to us, Bostynn has always been the home of fierce, outright obstinate people, who jumped at every opportunity to revolt, forming impromptu bands of peasant warriors who ransacked the countryside until the Imperial army would inevitably arrive to put them down.\n\nThe "Bridge-Wardens" were experienced hunters who frequently put themselves at the head of those revolts and, when not busy leading, constituted the best archers available north of Arverynn.

Before any more Rzentur, new or old, gets the idea to invade us, we should act preemptively: many Old Rzentur tribes would like nothing more than to settle the lands of their cousins to the south, and some of our "traders" will make sure to provide them with the motivations and means to do so."

 G31_conquerors_of_the_known_world_desc:0 "Vareynn rules Dolindha, and Dolindha rules the Ynn. It was King Komerjon of Vareynn who slew King Vatrevid of Malacnar in personal combat and claimed the City of Warriors for himself, and through his successors Vareynn expanded to rule all the lands along the Ynn River, forging the Ynnic Empire spanning from Svemel the High City to Adbrabohvi by the End of the World."
 G31_blood_of_lukaus:0 "Blood of Lukaus"
 G31_blood_of_lukaus_desc:0 "The tradition of horse-riding in Dolindha traces back to the legendary King Lukaus, who was exiled from the Kingdom of the Mountain and went on to found many cities in the Ynn River Valley. In order to vanquish evil, and trample all those who would question his rule, he struck a pact with the feral antler horses of the Dolindhan forests, becoming Rogaispodhan - the Antler Lord, the first elf who was allowed to ride them.\n\nWhile Dolindhan horses have since become far more manageable and tamer through centuries of domestication, still today it is said that if a knight has a particular connection and affinity with his horse, he has "the Blood of Lukaus", and nowhere is the blood of Lukaus still as present as in Vareynn's nobility."

While the Amethyst Knights of Amacimst are the ones who came closest to succeeding, they are but one of the many names we've heard. In order to keep up with this stream of challengers, mandatory training sessions will be scheduled, where our knights will be brought up to date with the latest fencing techniques, riding formations, and fighting tactics of the enemies. While improving their individual prowess, these exercises will also have the side effect of teaching them to trust their generals and readily follow orders."

 G31_harbingers_of_honour_desc:0 "The Ynnic Empire wasn't forged only through fire and bloodshed. Some states, such as Brelar, joined Vareynn willingly, while others, like Stanyrhrada, were inherited through royal marriage. When King Komerjon annexed Malacnar, he cited how the Malacnari followed the strongest, which he had proven himself to be by slaying their king. When King Jeborad crossed the Ynn at Vels Bacar to conquer southward, he did so coming to the aid of his allies in Stanyrhrada. Through the centuries, Vareynn gained a reputation as a just if firm ruler, and its citizens set the standard for what it meant to be honourable and civilized, a standard which lives on through the knightly virtue of today."
 G31_the_eternal_castle:0 "The Eternal Castle"
 G31_the_eternal_castle_desc:0 "A short ride north of Vareynn City, Vareynn Amac is the oldest castle in the Ynn. Originally built as a fortified military encampment, it was under the care of the Drevondarant dynasty - a cadet branch of the Imperial family - that it was restructured to be a permanent residence for the nobility. While it was able to host many jousts and feasts throughout the ages, gathering nobles from all the Ynn, the castle also withstood many periods of hardships, both financially and militarily, and thus its keepers learned to make the best with whatever limited resources they had."
 G31_legacy_of_king_emperor_joanseln:0 "Legacy of King-Emperor Joanseln"
 G31_legacy_of_king_emperor_joanseln_desc:0 "Ancient Vareynn was ruled with the help of an assembly of riders, originally meant to allow those too elderly to ride in battle to continue assisting the realm by providing the ruler with regency and advice. Over time the Rider Assembly schemed to gain more and more power, even obtaining the ability to veto the King's decisions and resolve on matters of state independently.\n\nIt was King Joanseln yen Dolin who, in the seventh century after Flood, saw to it that the assembly was limited back to its advisory role and proclaimed himself the absolute Emperor of the Ynn, and while he was assassinated only a year later, his daughter finished the job and put all conspirators to death in a most gruesome fashion. While ideas of insubordination and divided rule are long behind us, we will not hesitate to stamp them out again should the specter of mob rule ever show up again."

The hippodrome was thus left half-built, and to this day it remains as a stain on the city's pride, with both the hippodrome and Vareynn being left in disrepair.\n\nNo more! We will complete the hippodrome, rebuilding it from the ground up if necessary, and then there will be no more doubters: Vareynn will be back in business being the world's capital."

Impervious to fire, the tree is said to be old as the Ynn itself, and will impart its wisdom on any soul kind enough to write a poem for it.

Scarily large and unapproachable even to the most seasoned foresters and pure-hearted souls, the secret to ride them has been jealously passed down Drevkenuc's ruling line, and while Drevkenuco rulers are disqualified from riding them in jousts, nobody can contest that the sight of a Drevkenuco lord atop one of those massive creatures is a truly astonishing sight to behold."

To make up for this, we will hire foreign instructors and promote our toughest fighters to captains, so that they may teach and train our militiamen semi-regularly, creating a sense of comradery and of belonging to their corp."
 G29_the_potraga:0 "The Potraga"
 G29_the_potraga_desc:0 "An old tradition in Drevkenuc, called Potraga or "the Quest", is for any male aged 16 to take a trip outside the forest to see the world abroad and experience its people and what they have to offer. While the most common destinations for this trip are Vareynn and Arverynn, the most daring youth have ventured all the way to the ruins of the old Mountain Kingdom occupied by the heathen Rzentur, the endless plains of the Epednar, the dark forest of the Cursed Ones, or even the northern wastes populated by Ice Sleepers, bringing home powerful artifacts and becoming adults along the way."
 G29_strict_river_worship:0 "Strict River Worship"
 G29_strict_river_worship_desc:0 "In ancient times, the native Drevkenuco people practiced a heathen worship, bringing gifts and offerings to the trees and the creatures of the forest rather than to the holy Ynn River. No more! It was King Vylaron of Vareynn who made our ancestors see the errors of their ways, and ever since our conversion in the fourth century after Flood we have been quick and proactive in stamping out any form of heathenry, just like King Vylaron did, by having every village - no matter how small or secluded - presided by the watchful eye of a river inquisitor."

A refusal is a crime of the highest order - death is the usual punishment, but some of the crueler officials have been known to break the legs of offenders and exile them as crippled beggars, so that they may spend the rest of their lives kowtowing to peasants and animals to atone for their dishonor."

 G36_poisoned_arrows_desc:0 "Extracted from a purple flower named Leak - meaning lesson - is a harrowing poison which is brewed in Trompolere.

The weakest victims convulse and scream ripping at their skin only a few minutes after Leak has entered their bloodstream, while the strongest are slowly driven insane over the course of days or weeks as their family watches. To invaders, this is the curse of the Sarda. To us, it's a harsh lesson we teach any who would invade our homeland."

 G36_treehouse_striders_desc:0 "Vital to the survival of the early Sarda settlements, was a system of travelling sentries and messengers. Once a village came under attack or enemies were sighted, a messenger would run for miles on foot through the forest towards the nearest treehouse, and that treehouse would in turn send out messengers to warn other villages and treehouses. Trompolere, originally one such treehouse, was made into a castle during the ninth century after Flood, with a courtyard where the original tree still grows, and stables for horses which allow our sentries to travel much faster."

On his sixteenth birthday, he took the reins of his small fief and embarked on a campaign to reunite all of the Ynn under one banner again, meeting great initial success. While he made many enemies, and died without reaching his ambition, the bold - if not outright visionary - ambition of Alaran left a mark on the collective imagination, and he became the most famous scion of House yen Cestor, his name learned by young Ynnic lords through history books.\n\nPerhaps a little Alaran is growing up in Trompolere today and, inspired by the myth of his predecessor, he will amaze the world with even greater ambitions."

While some of our advisors have brought up the possibility of adopting firearms, archery is the symbol of our nation, and we are not going to forsake it for a clunky glorified crossbow brought by outsiders. Rather, we shall double our efforts to counter the weapon of the Cannorians, donning our troops in enchanted cloaks resistant to gunpowder and casting magical protections on their eardrums.

While many towns sought the protection of lords and lost their independence, Bosancovac pooled its wealth into hiring mercenaries and swaying landless knights to their side.\n\nOn the water, many of these knights began anew, forsaking their heavy armour and horses in favour of light scalemail and gondolas - and while this earned them the mocking name of "Paddleboard Knights" by other Dolindhans, they eagerly adopted it as their own, having the last laugh because, on the water, even the mightiest antler horse is just food for the fish."

This duality was finally brought to an end in 1224, when the River faction, aided by the lordship of Amacimst and many Paddleboard Knights, assumed undisputed control of the Bridge-Town and confined the mayor of Bosancovac to the far side of the Ynn River, at Imstana.\n\nEver since then, the day of the Holy Coup is celebrated with a week of festivities as a crowd marches from the western side of the River towards the southern one, reciting holy sermons and partaking in many activities along the way: canoe races and canoe jousts, public banquets, zoos of river monsters, dramatic recreations of historical events and plays… all generously funded by our patrician families."

While this originally meant trading with Sarda lordships downstream and the occasional Veykodan tribe, a huge new array of opportunities opened up with the arrival of Cannorian settlers. Particularly fruitful was the trade of lamp oil and ropes made from the fat and leather of mighty Dolindhan animals, and bombs, the manufacturing of which saw a small boom in the Bridge-Town of Bosancovac. In turn, Bosancovaco patricians started collecting many new goods and commodities the Cannorians brought, with rubies from Argezvale being the most prized rarity."

However, he was ultimately executed by Emperor Calrodiy II for failing to extend the lifespan of the ailing emperor, and many of his discoveries were then banned from publication.

Other authors have chosen to ignore the matter of the Ending Flood completely, focusing instead on Arkanvyr's bravery and ingenuity in the face of unknown monsters and hardships, a bravery which has inspired many a Ynnic knight to do great deeds such as the slaying of Drozmagog, the Rzentur dragon."

Rather than competing for championship, the Knights Oathkeeper have thus decided to serve as law-enforcement, flying their white banners and drapes across the forested countryside as they deter any aspiring brigand and rabble-rouser from disturbing the peace. And while other knights may mock this relatively placid lifestyle, isn't peace what all true warriors strive for?\n\nIn 1721, at the Battle of Delanydon Crossing, the Knights Oathkeeper finally took up arms yet again - but not the arms everyone expected, for they began unleashing deadly volleys of pistol fire upon the enemy lines before their charge, in a devastating combination of Tellumtiri gunmanship and Ynnic chivalry."

But just because of this he wasn't disloyal: when he was offered immortality by a witch, Jurion refused, informed Lukaus, and rode to destroy the witch and her coven. His son Jansred was an excellent rider and in 143 he ambushed the Malacnari in the woods of Grebniesth, halting their resurgence and avenging the line of Lukaus which the Malacnari had extinguished.\n\nStantirvare was the first contact point between Sarda and Dolindhan civilizations, and while it would ultimately wane in importance and shrink into a village, it was Talanis, the third-born son of the Lord of Stantirvare, who went south and founded House yen Bacar, a patrician family of Vels Bacar that eventually rose to become its protectors and rulers."

Departing the old homeland near the western mountains, they navigated the Ynn's deadly waters all the way to Stantirvare, the first encounter between Sarda and Dolindhans. Vels Bacar was built in their honour at the middle point of their voyage, and two giant statues bearing their likeness were constructed, one on each side of the Ynn River.\n\nWhen King Jeborad of Vareynn declared war on the Principality of Vels Bacar in 560, he had his soldiers deface the statue of Filenval-on-the-Northern-Side, cutting off his head and having it be replaced by a replica of his own face. After the war was over, Jeborad mockingly told the Bacarans “Find the head, and you can put it back.". Bacaran citizens spent two centuries looking for the missing head, until it was finally found to have floated past Adbrabohvi and the Divine Waterfall, ending in the Nether World where a tribe of Boek had taken to worshipping it. Emperor Calasandor yen Brelar graciously paid for its return, while Jeborad's head was brought to Vareynn. “It was destiny" the Emperor commented “That the head of a great explorer would see the world beyond the Ynn River."\n\nThe statues of Filenval and Filenval stand next to the dam to this day, sending off all the dead who float down the Ynn River."

And as they argued, the Bacaran allies, the Amstenuri, lost a battle they had to fight on their own and found themselves besieged.\n\nIn the second phase of the war, Bacaran sentries kept watch and made fortifications over the fords of Arverynn while their main force engaged the Stanyrhradans, seeing some successes. It was all for nothing when, in 572, Jeborad took the city of Vels Bacar by the storm using a path nobody had foreseen: a massive pontoon bridge had been built in just seven days from one statue of Filenval to the other, and, with the cover of the mist that in rainier days makes it impossible to see the other side of the Ynn, nobody in Vels Bacar noticed Vareynn's soldiers and riders atop their massive antler horses suddenly charging in before it was too late.\n\nThe lesson our marshals have drawn from all this is thus: “Time is of essence.""

And while the first elections were held successfully to the cheer of the people, this move was deeply unpopular with many Sarda neighbours, who called the new republic an anachronism and a betrayal of Ynnic values in favour of Cannorization. Thus began the War of the Bacaran Succession, where Lord Calrodiy V of Arverynn pressed the claim of a vassal of his to rule Vels Bacar.\n\nThe war soon escalated, involving not only Sarda, but also many frontiermen nations and even the Mayor of Valorpoint and the Gospodh of the Rzentur. In the final stages of the war, kobold snipers were picking off Escanni knights and dwarven cannons mercilessly bombarded the walls of Vels Bacar, as other dwarves on the Bacaran side rebuilt them each day and night. The war lasted for 21 years and saw Vels Bacar besieged five times, ending only after the death of a million people and Vels Bacar's destruction. Afterwards, Vels Bacar stopped existing as a city, and its name was only used to refer to the nearby dam."

No effort was made to restore those books, but recently some councillors have advised our Lord that, with the arrival of so many new people to the Epednan prairie, new Archives detailing their differences would be most useful.

Connecting the towers is a series of suspended walkways, which link up with the inner walls of the Upper Town.\n\nAtop Vyrisar Hill, the Upper Town houses the nobles, the barracks, and the supreme Teal Keep. This older core was built by will of Emperor Calrodiy I in the year 900 after Flood, for he desired a capital on the eastern bank of the Ynn River near the frontier with Veykoda, where it has stood, atop its great artificial mound, as a shield and beacon of Ynnic civilization even in the dark times of the collapse of the Empire."

Acting with the cover of the night, crazed fanatics entered the pits of the arena and broke the chains keeping the dragon in place, and as he flew up in the sky, he vengefully breathed several clouds of fire onto the city's districts before flying away.\n\nOur water mages battled the flames for three days, fighting street to street to contain them, and by the end of it Arverynn was left in ashes and ruins.

There they would perfect the virtues that had earned them their salvation, virtues that will earn them salvation again in the coming of a second Ending Flood.\n\nWhen Emperor Gamelirn the Pious of House Ralsvelik - bless His name - visited our settlement during the seventh century after Flood, he was awed by the piety and harmony he found.

When Adbrabohvi was built, the elf made his home there, easily befriending the local inhabitants and amazing them with magical feats.\n\nOne day the animals near Adbrabohvi started dying, killed by a demonic creature known as wendigo: the inhabitants, terrified, hid far up in their treehouses and bolted the doors and windows shut. It was then that the elf performed his greatest miracle: he went out in the woods alone to confront the wendigo, and scolded it for the evil it was doing. He told told the demon that it was still in time to repent, and that, if it swore to repair the damage it had done, the curse on its soul would be lifted.\n\nAmazingly, the wendigo accepted, and swore an oath to defend Adbrabohvi. No wildlife died afterwards, and the wendigo's soul was allowed to find peace.\n\nToday we remember that elf as Guvnik, and all outsiders who arrive to Adbrabohvi still have to recite the oath sworn by the wendigo on that fateful day, before they are allowed to join our community."

Though some claimed he was little more than another beast to be found in the woods near Vels Domfan, in truth he and his band adopted the chivalric values of their Dolindhan conquerors: never using violence when scare tactics would do, providing the poor with food stolen from the rich, and protecting the locals from any (other) prowling monsters.\n\nRhovynuc evaded imperial capture for decades, until betrayal saw him captured and executed.

The Imperial fleet, lacking enemies to strike out against after the Ynnic Empire's unification, was deemed too costly to maintain and the emperors looked for a solution.\n\nThat solution presented itself in 633, when the Champion of the Ynn encountered an enigmatic Sarda known as 'the Striding Man' who spent his days trekking for miles across Sarda. While the tale of him outrunning the Champion's horse is almost certainly an exaggeration, the Champion was nonetheless impressed enough that he vouched for him with the Empress, and the idea of the Selin Prealtac - “Way Outposts", Seltac for short - was born.\n\nThe Ynnic Empire became thus connected through a network of waystations which relayed messages from one end to the other, similar to the Treehouse Striders of Sarda tradition, but augmented by the new steeds Dolindhans brought. As to the Imperial fleet, its vessels would be later repurposed to funerary barges, and they would meet a gradual, dignified end throughout the reign of Emperor Gamelirn the Pious."

The Cannorians readied their rifles and pointed at our lines, as doubt began to seep among our fighters.\n\nAnd then… it rained. One of the strongest rains seen in Sarda downpoured with no warning over the battlefield, sabotaging the mechanisms of the Cannorian guns and sweeping away the stakes. The Sarda, seeing this as a blessing by the Ynn River, were emboldened and charged against the expedition, making short work of them as our cavalry cut them off."

And so our dynasties have carried on, dancing through the unpredictable rains of history, choosing when to risk and when to relent.\n\nWhat we have found is that Cannorian vassals and Ynnic vassals think much alike: they are both easy to anger, they are both fond of their liberties, and they both contain opportunists and genuine believers alike, as well everything in between.

Now, if I may, I do hope you will accept one more." The Sarda bowed, when another Sarda approached with his entourage.\n\nHe was a high priest dressed in celestial robes lined with gold, bearing the sigil of the Temple of Adbrabohvi, and one of his servants brought forth a pillow on top of which was a crown embedded with a Y-shaped royal blue jewel.

A green glow, the hint of magic, sentience, or a greater force. Legends speak of ancient antler horses being able to talk, being able to select people for their nobleness and virtue, just like people selected horses for their strength and speed.\n\nThis "force" allowed Ynnic knights to practice for the longest time a hybrid cavalry-foot technique, known as Leomarc, the "Charge-Jump": charging into battle without stirrups nor lances, Ynnic knights hurled themselves into the air and into the fray before their steed collided into the enemy lines, and as the knight began cutting down his many enemies his antler horse would gore and trample to death just as many."

There is however a strict and obscure process involved: differently-raised antler horses can yield antlers that are hardly more magical than wood, while others can easily channel enough magic to lift a grown adult, and only lords and knights seem to have any understanding as to why.\n\nWith an assured control over the distribution of their horses’ magical antlers, Dolindhan nobles used it as an expedient to organize the practitioners of the magical arts, even founding schools or academies for mages managed by trusted people.

Beginning in the 1400’s, several expeditions from both Benter and Mayte territory have pushed the Watchers away from the jungles and savanna on the eastern border of Haraf, establishing new communities on the mountain slopes while further confining our ancient enemy.\n\nOf course, given the uniquely aggressive and fierce Watchers originating from the flat-top mountains of Topetl Icuailoluh who have limited Mayte’s eastward reach for centuries, the King Mask’s influence over these expeditions was rather short-lived, leaving us to actually manage and supply many of the new communities, with the last ones being secured as recently as 1435. Their loyalty is first and foremost to themselves, but they all hold a special place in their souls for our people, and all of Haraf will be thinking of our good deed for a long while."

This religious tolerance extends to most Cheshoshi, who are accepted in our tribe as soon as they stop sacrificing living beings to their god of death. Due to the relative richness of our lands compared to the Tameter, we have received many Cheshoshi migrants throughout the years, forming a true community inside our territory, whose members are as part of the Benter as any Mayte would."

Clearly, this insult cannot be ignored, and our craftspeople masks, as well as our new community of artificer masks, have resolved to prove these Cannorians wrong.\n\nNow, anyone who thinks that our staffs are crude would be dissuaded by the worktime of months that goes into carving, engraving, and smoothing our so-called “clubs"… as well as the gun barrel and trigger that our artificers have carefully built within the club. Those who question their effectiveness in combat shall find themselves on the receiving end of a gunshot to the chest, followed by 25 pounds of Steelwood, chopped from the mightiest trees in Haraf before being magically treated by our artificers, leaving them harder, stronger and more capable of giving a devastating blow to a maskless than any of their swords."

One of these lights in the darkness was Gophira, “the Fort”. Led ably by Bukka Raya, called the Greenbringer for his use of magic to grow food through the harshest winters, the people of Gophira constructed great fortifications to protect the fledgling haven from the assaults of those who would seek to loot or destroy it.\n\nNowadays, the legacy of the Greenbringer is clear – Gophira stands as the greatest fort in Taychend, its fortifications upgraded and expanded over time. Though the scars of battle linger on the stones of the great fortress, and the citadel has not escaped conquest or subjugation entirely, the rows of cyclopean walls and piercing towers stand as a testament to the greatest lesson the Gophirans learnt from their founder-god: complacency in defence is a fatal weakness."

From the days of Bukka Raya to the apex of the Second Gophiran Empire, the foundries and smithies of Gophira have worked tirelessly to produce every manner of iron or steel object needed for the city’s needs.\n\nPerhaps it is this industrious flexibility that has allowed Gophira to dominate its two brother cities for so long. While recent misfortunes have allowed them to reclaim their independence, the Kings of Gophira know that should they ever bring Kattisangamar and Banderuttai to heel again, they will once again stand as the undisputed Iron Masters of Yodhanpir."

Long past  the fall of the Asaedzudar, many feared that Taychend might forever be subjected to Chendhyan rule, as a dozen remnant “Aedzudars” were carved from the lands of the old Empire. Then Olhokar rose, and they feared no longer.\n\nGiving himself entirely to the hands of fate, at every turn Olhokar consulted oracles and diviners, and from his powerbase in Gophira, recently refortified after its sacking by Ueltaron, Olhokar conducted an incredible campaign against the Chendhayan Aedzudars. With fate by his side, he restored native rule to Taychend, and in doing so became the first native emperor of Taychend in over 500 years.\n\nAlas, his reign would be brief – in service to the dark words of an oracle, Olhokar sacrificed his eldest child to secure Gophira’s future, provoking a massive revolt that shattered his realm. However, even this would prove fortuitous for Olhokar’s beloved city, as the line of his second son would themselves piece back together the empire the Fortuitous first conquered."

While for a time it seemed that Gophira would be drowned in the tide of fate, drastic times called for drastic measures. Harrihara IV created the “Ironblood Army”, a military class drawn from both the cities and countryside, with mandated training and heavily subsidised equipment. Able to be called up at a moment’s notice, Gophira created a large and dependable core of infantry, whose constant readiness allowed them to maintain their martial traditions. While expensive, this would give Gophira the edge they needed over the city’s enemies.\n\nAs this force broke Oremvand’s Chendhyan mercenaries in the Oremvandian Wars, and reconquered the territory Gophira had lost, the military of the Sangamars once again transformed. Funded using the heavy taxes levied on the their many subject cities, the Ironblood Army would become a truly professional force during the Second Empire, crushing countless revolts and warlord-pretenders. While this professionalism would eventually be Gophira’s downfall, their legacy is nonetheless one of martial excellence and incredible capability."

Founded originally as a simple fort guarding the river that leads to Gophira, as the Second Gophiran Empire expanded, Kannalulthe quickly became the centre of the Taychendi economy. Wishing to be close to the centre of Imperial power, merchant houses, slave traders, metalworkers and all other sorts of industries moved to the city. Soon enough, Kannalulthe became the de facto imperial capital, further expanding until it outgrew even Nanru Nakar in size and population.\n\nWhile Kannalulthe fell far after the end of the Second Gophiran Empire, even now the ruins are vast and magnificent. The city’s cyclopean arches and walls, monumental temples, shrines and statues, and of course the eponymous dam that dominates the centre of the city, all continue to inspire the architects of Gophira – not to mention the incredible quantity of building materials that can be found within the city’s ruins.

The resulting battle of Nymbhava, that saw the Ironblood Army split and arrayed against itself, was one of the largest battles in Taychendi history. Nymbhava would eventually prove to be the inciting incident for the terrible drama that would consume the Empire, setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to the War of the Six Emperors.\n\nFor nearly 15 years, Gophira fell into a vicious cycle of rebellion and mutinies that eventually caused its violent disintegration. However, this period of ceaseless warfare also saw some of the greatest military feats of the empire. With both Ironblood soldiers and Sangamar pretenders faced with utter destruction, Gophiran military excellence returned in stunning fashion, and the legacy of the tactics and great deeds in those wars inspire the men of Gophira even today."

Now Elrandar led the people of Palaya Orenkoraim to conquer Cankamam. After tearing down the walls and temples of Cankamam, the bricks would be moved along the Kalavend back to Palaya Orenkoraim.

After a long and successful reign, he ascended to godhood and his mortal form was buried in Hessamadha.\n\nMany of his reforms are, by modern standards, redundant and outdated.

The freedmen crews who sailed these ships were notorious for their ferocity and mercilessness, adopting a policy of zero tolerance that went far beyond the customary rules of maritime warfare and involved the wholesale slaughter of any free crew found aboard slaver ships. Feted as heroes, these raiders were, over time, incorporated into the formal military as amphibious shock infantry."
 F56_the_garden_fortress:0 "The Garden Fortress"
 F56_the_garden_fortress_desc:0 "Like their distant Bulwari cousins, the Dasmati hold formal gardens as almost a prerequisite for civilised society. Dasmati garden design has over the last few centuries diverged from the Bulwari mainstream, emphasising high walls and private gardens within the home. Decoration on street-facing walls is limited to murals, usually in a dark red-and-white colour scheme known as birmi, though the rich find myriad ways to squeeze innovation and beauty from this limited palette. For those allowed across the sturdy threshold of a Dasmati home, a paradise garden awaits, faithfully tended even in the most modest of tenements.\n\nIn place of the many public gardens of cities like Brasan, Dasmatuš has just a single enormous park encompassing the entirety of Lašni Hill. While officially a mausoleum complex for the Dasmati Akals, it is not a place of grief or sadness. Instead, the Dasmati venerate their ancestral rulers through recreation - the laughter of children, the murmured conversation of lovers and the gentle splashing of the pleasure pools is finer than any chorale."
 F56_chainbreaker_tactics:0 "Chainbreaker Tactics"
 F56_chainbreaker_tactics_desc:0 "Dasmati naval strategy evolved continually in response to generally larger and better-funded Raheni powers, and increasingly came to focus on mass manoeuvre of narrow cannonboats and mage-staffed saboteur ships. Aiming to reduce casualties among the enslaved as much as possible, Dasmati tactics focused on destroying sails and targeting the abovedecks to thin the crew, then coming in fast and boarding en-masse. These tactics, combined with a policy of automatic enlistment for all ship-slaves willing to defect, meant that Dasmatuš never experienced the kind of chronic manpower shortages or piloting skill gaps that forced press gangs in other navies."

 F56_legacy_of_kerusah_desc:0 "The clash at Kerusah was the single largest battle of a decades-long low-level conflict with the slaver states of the Gulf, referred to in Dasmatuš as Attin Ehar, “the grinding years”. In the late summer of 1426, after a year of raiding campaigns on the Raheni slave-road in Gebahiri, the main force of the Dasmati army found itself cut off far inland with limited supplies. Realising that there was no realistic route west towards home, the Dasmati marched directly north towards the coast, voluntarily engaging a force almost twice the size of their own. They would withstand constant assault for almost fourteen hours.\n\nFirst, the Dasmati rebuffed a series of elephant charges, deploying successive layers of palings to gruesome effect. When that failed, the slavers attempted to use their numbers to swallow the Dasmati from the flanks, only to choke on the effort. The Dasmati, having resigned themselves to a last stand, inflicted heavy casualties and freed almost three thousand men."
 F56_unyielding:0 "Unyielding"
 F56_unyielding_desc:0 "The final gnollish assault on Dasmatuš was fought uphill through narrow, winding streets in the middle of a punishing storm season in late 1733. The few veterans left organised the population into neighbourhood groups that built barricades, collapsed buildings onto major throughways and raided the invaders incessantly.\n\nIt took the gnoll armies more than a week to make their way a mile and a half from the Aqtara to the tomb of Dasma. Maqeti mages booby-trapped rats with explosive sigils and let them loose to run back towards the docks where the gnolls had made their camps. The entire water supply downstream of the Inner Lock was deliberately contaminated with corpses and then polluted with toxic reddish tattav-root dye, poisoning hundreds. When the gnolls finally pushed through the final line of defences, they were confronted with a mass suicide on the mausoleum steps. The Maqeti, the Dasmati, died free."

For in truth, we lament its necessity as well. We truly do wish the fields could be tended without the chance of any view of their beauty being marred by an ugly green splotch.

And the blood of a Marlliander? Pristine, well-kept, bred-for over generations and not a drop allowed to be polluted.

One such group settled in the Magocracy of Esthíl, but in little time they noticed that many of their people were disappearing.\n\nThe truth as to why was quickly discovered: Esthíl’s mage-queen, Varina Escer, was using them as sacrifice in her pursuit of lichdom. Thousands of faithful met a fate worse than death as their very souls were sacrificed to dark magic. Those who escaped had no place to return to, for Ionntrás had fallen to Esthíl's sorcerer armies. Desperate, the survivors rallied behind Father Godwin, a preacher who had received a vision of a new nation for the Corinite faithful, and fled Escann to seek this promised land in Aelantir.\n\nThe memory of the horror that brought them to Aelantir lingers in the minds of the Corinsfielders, and they deeply detest magic of all types. Corinsfielder communities suppress or expel any culture within their realm which permits the study of magic, and magical practitioners are decried as witches and killed on sight."

Third was the perilous Cliffs of Ruin, which claimed a quarter of the remaining men in treacherous climb — and when they had been conquered, they were hounded north by tattooed warriors and horned monsters.\n\nThe few remaining Corinspilgrims were exhausted and nearly out of supplies when they came across a lush prairie filled with red flowers that resembled poppies. The beleaguered settlers took the sight as a sign from Corin that they had at last found their new home, and named the land Corinsfield, dubbing the flowers “Corin’s Poppies”. As the settlers soon found out, the crushed petals of the flowers could be used to make a deep red dye, which would soon become both the chief export of their burgeoning farmsteads and the symbol of their religious devotion.

As a result, the people of Corinsfield have become renowned sharpshooters, and any who would approach one of their fortified communities in war would do so under a hail of deadly-accurate musket fire."

The land itself was fertile and conducive to farming, and the need for many hands to work the fields led to a strong push for large families that would become integral to Corinsfielder culture. In the 1600s, the average Corinsfielder couple would have between 6 and 7 children, and families of 12 or more were not uncommon. Coupled with an early age of marriage, this tendency to large families led to a massive surge in population, and by the 1640s the Corynn river was one of the more densely populated tributaries of the Ynn.\n\nCorinsfield's insistence on firearms training was imposed upon its large population giving them a huge pool of potential soldiers to draw upon when the need to defend their community arose, and the militias of Corinsfield, colloquially called The Red Sentries, were always well staffed and swelled with sufficient recruits."

Every Sorrowday, Corinsfielders would gather at their meeting house or temple and join forces to work on a new community project, which could range from building a new house for a recently wedded couple or repairing the town’s waterwheel to laying down a new road or preparing collective food stores for the winter.\n\nThese constant community improvements would make the towns of Corinsfield quietly prosperous and constantly changing, and although they were never as grand as the big cities of Cannor or the Ynn proper, travelers would liken them to points of light in a dark and unforgiving world."

By and large, Corinsfielders believed that all men are created equally and no man must impose his will over another without their consent. Corinsfield placed great emphasis on this belief in their governmental and religious structures: their administrators and lawmakers were elected for brief terms and could be removed from office if they went against the will of the people.

But for Adrahel, it would be a short-lived one: the captain of the Corinsfielders, Ichabod Roose, questioned Adrahel during the extravagant victory party and came to the conclusion that the rebellion was motivated by nothing more than personal ambition, and so he seized Adrahel and executed him for his act of treachery.\n\nUnexpectedly to many, Adrahel's execution was met with applause by the Ynnics, who saw in the Corinites a possible saviour from the corruption rife in their land. By the end of the day the banners of Corinsfield flew over Fadhevych.\n\nAn emboldened Corinsfielder-Fadhevychi army pushed further into Sarda, onto the Ynnic holy city of Adbrabohvi, which surrendered quickly to avoid the destruction of millenia-old artifacts. Roose promised no harm would come to the city, but rogue Istranari seeking revenge for their failed crusade disobeyed and pillaged the city at night. Losing hope for a victory, the Sarda Emperor proposed an armistice and Corinsfield, already feeling overextended, swiftly accepted. The crusade was over, but the Ynn River Faith would never be the same."

In honor of the white stallion, the guardians of the gold and the city that surrounds it carry his name. The Everlucky Chargers are the pride of Aramar, sworn to preserve the prosperity their namesake delivered.\n\nThese paladins of Ara are tasked with seeing shipments from the Imperial Mint safely across Cannor, protecting the goddess' shrines, ensuring the smooth flow of commerce in the city and her lands, and taking up arms to defend Aramar in times of war."

Yet, these are not the only dealers of such dishonesty. Mortal merchants twist words, fudge numbers, plunge knives of usury and greed into the sacred union of seller and buyer that underpins all commerce.\n\nThe Aramari temple holds an ever-evolving codex of laws that serve to clamp down upon the greed of financiers, merchants, moneychangers, and other handlers of coin. While most punishments for these fiscal offenses are metered in fines and revocation of titles and property, none stand quite so infamous or prominent as dealings with and worship of Forsara. Those proven guilty of such dark dealings are known to meet a most terrible fate, the ill-earned coin gained from their bargains melted and poured down their throats."

 A53_monopolized_coinminting_desc:0 "Since the long-gone milennia prior to Jorkad's fall, mages and alchemists have spent their lives chasing the ultimate secret of their craft, the transmutation of lead to gold. And, in that time where the men of Cannor were barbaric nomads, it was found. The Cannorian intelligentsia first rediscovered this ancient lore in a tome produced by one of the Sorcerer King's Acolytes, and summarily, the secret of alchemy's great work was soon set to practice.\n\nThe bank-breaking, unending conflicts of the Wars of Rule set creditors into such a riotous state that most every side involved was employing their finest mages and alchemists in illicit minting, transforming base metals into coinage to bankroll their squabbles. With the abundance of gold flowing through the Empire, inflation shot to astronomical levels, and all sides of the conflict were threatened with the collapse of their economies, and the revolt of dissatisfied peasantry in numbers that even their most powerful mages couldn't crush.\n\nThusly, one of the few agreements found under the rule of Gracos I was the institution of the Charter of Aramar. With a new system of minting devised and implemented by the avatar Liliana Crownsguard, each Crown crafted at the Imperial Mint would be infused with a distinct magical fingerprint, a universal mark that would show the coins as the sole legitimate tender within the Empire."

So, it seemed only right that, with the Adenners fleeing their shattered kingdom in the wake of the Greentide's relentless onslaught, Aramar would step in as a sanctuary. While some pursued the chivalric courts of far-flung Lencenor, Aramar plunged mountains of gold into quickly erecting sprawling tenements for Adean's folk, seeing that none would be denied a place amongst their number.\n\nNow, the city bustles and bulges with a fresh force of labor to hew her mines, and the teeming tenements brim with the sweet tunes of troubadours' tales of chivalry. Gratitude lingers among Adenners and other Escanni refugees, reclaiming her charitable image and seeing that the temple is owed many favors across the courts of Cannor."

 A53_ara_origin_desc:0 "The adherents of Ara know well that dice rolls and the clink of coins give much the same thrill as the heat of battle in many a heart, those souls finding a friend and worthy adversary in the whims of Lady Luck. Merchants, adventurers, thieves, and every sort who has known the razor-thin edge of fate pay their due to her, for on The Lady's whim lays fortune or fatality.\n\nIt is said that Ara is one of those lucky few mortals, alongside Munas and Balgar to ascend and stand amongst the gods of the Regent Court. While no histories of the distant time of her life have stood to the present, those theologians who have studied the ancient histories of Cannor have come to believe her to have lived the life of a nomadic chieftess during her time on Halann. The most prominent hypothesis arising from the prominence of Everlucky and the Horseshoe in her symbology, along with ancient relics and texts states that her domain had shifted alongside that of her people.\n\nTales from the days of Castanor, and records of discussion from the Pantheonic council recognizing her ascension hold that Ara's folk, now grown into the Crownsmen once wandered the land in a moving city of tents, so rich with the spoils of trade and plunder that one day, they found they could move no more, lest they abandon their fortune. Forced to forsake their nomadic lifestyle, Ara and her people developed from riders to merchants. However, they never lost the keen sense of adventure and eye for coin. Even with their new home, the followers of Ara continue to thunder across Halann in their unending quest for fortune, to keep the books of their fate forever in the black."
 A53_paper_money:0 "The Paper Crown"
 A53_paper_money_desc:0 "The employment of the gold coin was inextricably linked to its identity as Ara's symbol, and the exchange and counting of coin was held as a sacred ritual to the goddess. As a result, the use of banknotes was seen as impious and even heretical, so vicariously opposed by the Fortuners of Aramar that banks across Anbennar would be reticent to issue them, lest the flow of fresh coin from the Imperial Mint dry to a trickle. The Crown was the sole tender of Anbennar, and the Fortuners refused to see it masked in some Forsaric contract of flimsy paperwork.\n\nHowever, the Great Earthquake of 1672 would result in an ironic collapse. The mines of Aramar were wholly blocked by rubble, halting production, the city crawling to a halt when it most desperately needed an inflow of fresh currency to repair the damage inflicted by the disaster. The High Fortuner stood strong against any proactive changes, bringing the city to a boiling point. She was swiftly deposed in a coup by Ravelian sympathizers, who shortly issued the Proclamation of St. Aras.\n\nThe city would officially adopt the Ravelian faith, and the fortuners would integrate themselves into the hierarchy of the Church in exchange for the Rectorate's aid in rebuilding. The freshly minted Rector of St. Aras would issue a paper currency backed by the value of the gold in its mines, replacing the Gold Crown in a temporary measure that would come to stand in perpetuity."

The cost was paid with the Rail-tithe, a system where we extorted or forced any goblin clan or small enough orcish warband that wanted to move over the railways to give over a portion of their wealth and slaves. In time, this system allowed us to build the forces necessary to take the Heart of the Rails that we now call home."

Still, it is not enough. Scouts report bands of adventuring dwarves have returned to the Dwarovar, from whatever exile they have endured, likely as a consequence of Dookanson emptying the Serpentspine of both orcs and goblins. We must turn Er-Natvir into an unbreakable fortress, as no doubt there will be dwarves who will seek our home for their own.

A month-long period of solemn reflection was taken, during which time the hold's Runeworkers sealed the gate with specially runecarved granite blocks and Queen Odna used Vûrodrmonir to weave a complex spell over the gates. . It was decreed that the gates would only open again after 5,000 years had passed, and the heretical world was once again safe for true believers.

Instead, Arawkelin gained a strong cadre of former legionaries as new officers and leaders for their armies, training the native Kelino to mimic the days of old.\n\nOver time, these sun elves would later return home to Bulwar peacefully, or go to Azkare for a true semblance of a sun elf-led state, but the country's reliance on foreign officers training a largely native force remained. Just as Arawkelin was one of the first to welcome Cannorian traders, they were also one of the first to adopt their ways of war, and even offered luxurious positions to veteran soldiers to train up their army in this new era of gunpowder warfare."

 H85_idea_1_desc:0 "The Clanboss of the Truedagger Clan employs many assassins and cutthroats for punishing breakers of the law, or whoever happened to cross them that evening at dinner. To steal from the Clan, or worse, the Clanboss, is to invite a knife to your back and a garrote around your throat. Treason is even more ruthlessly punished, with the offending goblin or goblins having wire run through their arms, their legs broken, and then strung up on posts by earlier mentioned wire, dangling several feet in the air. Death is slow and cruel, and any attempting to aid the punished will instead join them."

Many other clans may see this as a critical threat to our existence, as they come armed with new weapons, new tactics and far more zeal than the ancestors which fled to whatever misbegotten corner of the world they had dug to. However, dwarves are creatures of habit and tradition, and the importance they place on their reclamation can be exploited like any weakness. Should we have to combat them, we can easily divert their slavish devotion and short attention spans with a few dwarven “relics” here and there. They will naturally seek to recover what is essentially trash, dividing themselves before us."

 H85_idea_4:0 "The Values of Cunning"
 H85_idea_4_desc:0 "Goblins are, generally speaking, very impatient. Many goblins are simply looking for a way to one-up their neighbor, or the quickest route to success. This is one of our people's greatest assets, as it drives us forward. But Clan Truedagger breeds a smarter goblin than the average. There is a time for patience and a time for expediency.

 H85_idea_5:0 "Unrestricted Raiding"
 H85_idea_5_desc:0 "In warfare, nothing is fair. The enemy, regardless of their nature, must be broken in both body and spirit. There are many ways to achieve this, but one that Clan Truedagger finds particularly useful is raiding. By allowing our warriors unrestricted rights to pillage and plunder during campaigns is an excellent incentive to not only move quickly through territory, as their fellow soldiers also plunder the countryside, but keep morale high during sieges."
 H85_idea_6:0 "The Lessons of Leadership"
 H85_idea_6_desc:0 "What makes a leader worth following? Respect? Fear? Violence? The Clanboss of the Truedagger Clan must use a mixture of all three, but not always in equal measure. Sometimes, a Clanboss must be respected and feared, or feared and bloodied. Or violent and respected. A Clanboss who can use and be all three is a successful Clanboss, a Clanboss that fails to inspire these will not be Clanboss for long."
 H85_idea_7:0 "Clever Cannonfire"
 H85_idea_7_desc:0 "Goblins are fond of explosives, this is a simple, fundamental fact of our people. Finding ways to properly harness this fondness, however, is slightly more difficult. As it stands, cannons are bulky, heavy things unfit to be carried by a goblin. However, one tinkerer has happened upon a method of making a lighter cannon, capable of being carried by a team of eight goblins, two of which are reserved for carrying the powder and ammunition. Though small, these rapidly deployable cannons are capable of being set up in harder to reach places with enough preparation, allowing for devastating ambushes and clever cannonfire."

Still, we find ourselves in an unfamiliar stretch of these great mountains, as we passed an actual dwarven hold, still inhabited by its keepers! Considering Dookanson's mustering, and how many warbands had come to his banners, it is only reasonable to prepare for them to make efforts to reclaim the rails and other holds.

Still, finding the necessary supplies for any large undertaking is difficult in the Serpentspine, be it from military campaigns to construction projects. So, we must acquire money and supplies from wherever we can - and if we have to ste- requisition supplies from our people as needed, then that is a simple, yet unavoidable misfortune. Goblins after all love to collect things, whether it was earned or not. What's wrong with collecting them back?"
 H87_idea_3:0 "Collection Administration"
 H87_idea_3_desc:0 "Collecting things from our people was easy, at first. Now, however, fewer and fewer goblins are paying their fair share to the Clan as a whole, and by extension the Clanboss.

 H87_idea_4:0 "Clanboss' Cut"
 H87_idea_4_desc:0 "The effort of attempting to collect from our clan grows more and more difficult with each passing year, as goblins find clever rules or rather clever ways to hide their wealth from the Clanboss. The obvious solution is to simply take a percentage of any exchange or trade. This will allow us to move on from simply strong-arming goblins for big lump sums of wealth infrequently, to a much easier to budget stream of income."
 H87_idea_5:0 "Armament Effort"
 H87_idea_5_desc:0 "As the process of our collection grows, there have been many who would want to take from us our wealth and our land. Be it dwarf, orc, or even our fellow goblin, we must be ready to spend some of our wealth in order to defend it. By arranging for certain weapon producers to be given less extensive collection by our special agents, this will allow us to build a better understanding with those who are willing to supply our military forces. As well, it is not like part of the wealth we give away won't end up coming back to ourselves… "
 H87_idea_6:0 "Collection Breaks"
 H87_idea_6_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to centralize our wealth around the Clanboss and his ever growing organization, even as it grows so large as to require meetings on how to allocate the collection for needs of state, we have to rely on the powerful and influential who are outside the Clanboss' organization. By offering lessened collection and allowing them to keep more of their wealth, we can make them indebted to us in other ways, ensuring that we can make up for lost revenue from the rest of the Clan. "
 H87_idea_7:0 "Regulation of the Collection"
 H87_idea_7_desc:0 "Taxes. As we come into contact with other societies beyond the Serpentspine, primarily those in Bulwar and by extension our kin who continued to flee during the Exodus, we have learned other societies call our method of collection 'Taxes.'' While it matters little what we call it, at the end of the day it seems nobody likes paying up for the good of the state. Taking some inspiration from our kin in Bulwar however, has given the Clanboss an idea. By formalizing the rules of Collection into a series of codes, laws, and formal dates of payment, we can keep our subjects less disgruntled and reduce rock-thrown complaints through the Clanboss' windows- and at the Clanboss in general."

 H89_idea_1_desc:0 "Since their earliest days, the Snotfinger Clan has practiced a tradition of insults, initially designed to lure orcs into prepared ambushes. As the clan moves forward, so too has this tradition. Many goblins spend their spare time perfecting new insults for both rivals and friends. Now their insult skills are not only used to taunt the enemy into their demise, but have also become a tool of diplomacy and negotiation."
 H89_idea_2:0 "Orc Slayers"
 H89_idea_2_desc:0 "Before the Greentide breached through Khugdihr and spilled into Escann, the goblin slave Rurnor Snotfinger led a group of fellow goblin slaves into the nearby caverns, avoiding the fate of those who would become the Common Goblins. Every goblin of Snotfinger knows this story well, and knows the truth of why there can never be peace with orcs. They all must die.\n\nOf course, there are many others who share our hatred of the orcs, and we may find ourselves with strange allies along the way. "
 H89_idea_3:0 "Free Goblins All"
 H89_idea_3_desc:0 "The Snotfinger clan came into existence through our escape from orcish slavery, and none of us have any intention of returning to it.

 H89_idea_4:0 "Snotfinger University"
 H89_idea_4_desc:0 "Within the depths of Snotslair lies a great complex of goblin learning known as Snotfinger University, founded in 1476 AA and named after Rurnor Snotfinger. Established by the goblins of the Snotfinger Clan as a school of engineering, in time it would become a city on its own merits. The purpose would end up being to both educate the next generation of expert goblin weapon-makers and engineers, as well as keep them and their experiments safely away from where they might blow up something actually important."
 H89_idea_5:0 "Chainbreaker Wars"
 H89_idea_5_desc:0 "Even during the Greentide, the Serpentspine was far from emptied of orcs. Dookanson would send plenty of warbands back into the mountains to rally orcish warriors and capture goblin slaves. This would lead to the Chainbreaker Wars, where the Snotfinger Clan would ambush orcish slavers making their way to Escann and liberate fellow goblins. Some would join with the Snotfinger Clan, bolstering the clan's numbers and further ensuring that the clan could withstand further struggles."
 H89_idea_6:0 "Trade Through The Dwarovar"
 H89_idea_6_desc:0 "With the end of the Greentide, the reclamation of Escann and dwarves returning to the Dwarovar led to a time of great difficulty for Clan Snotfinger. In time, however, trade with the surface would be established. Unlike the hidebound and traditional dwarves, Goblins have far fewer scruples in both business partners and methods of acquisition. Goblins, unlike dwarves, are far more capable in extracting the wealth hidden away in the tunnels and caverns of the Serpentspine. With markets in Escann reopening, it is only natural for us to take our fair share, especially with those unfairly turned away by the dwarves for petty things like “Murder” or “Smuggling”. Of course, taking a little bit extra off the top to finance wars and other endeavors is just the price of doing solid, reputable business in the Dwarovar"

 H89_idea_7_desc:0 "Invented by the Snotfinger inventor Slobald Piestealer, Gojuice is a potent concoction originally designed to keep him awake forever, thereby increasing productivity. After making it, Slobald quickly, and fatally, discovered the lethal side effects of continued consumption of his invention.\n\nThankfully his daughter and lab assistant Qihx was able to save the recipe, while also reducing the dosage per cup. It is now used to help Snotfinger soldiers run down retreating enemies, giving them a burst of speed and energy to ensure that none of the enemy escape to fight again."

Many clans struggled against dwarves and orcs, but none other had to endure the pain we had been subjected to. As slaves to a black orc warband we were the lowest of the low, we were worth less than the dirt we slept on. But deep in our hearts there stirred a thought. A faint memory of hope that someday we could be free once more. This hope nurtured us, strengthened our resolve. It is only through these decades of hidden resistance that we could eventually gain our freedom from the orcs."
 H84_idea_2:0 "Empty Halls"

To prove that an advisor can survive the world they need to fight for their place. Whoever wishes to lead must defeat the one in front of him. This way only the truly strong will be the ones to advise the Clanboss on matters of state."
 H84_idea_4:0 "Mithril Coinage"

To ease the burden we have supplemented their pay with coins not made of gold but of mithril, which we have in relative abundance thanks to our home, the mithril hold of Mithradhûm. This mithril coinage enables us to put our gold to other use."
 H84_idea_5:0 "Reuse Refuse"
 H84_idea_5_desc:0 "Left in the wake of the fall of Aul-Dwarov many holds and roads are full of ancient dwarven mechanisms and machinery of war.

Especially the old cannons and firearms are useful once they are outfitted and repaired with what we can find elsewhere. These patchwork weapons are quite hefty and to our delight we have found that they leave more than a few scars and blue spots."
 H84_idea_6:0 "Innovative Mining"
 H84_idea_6_desc:0 "While drills and pickaxes are perfectly suitable tools to scratch the rock of the Serpentspine they are not much use if we want to dig down fast. For that we need to blast away all of the useless rock by firing explosives from our mithril-cannons and free the precious, shiny metals, obliterating the surrounding stone in much the same way as we did to our warband when we gained freedom. These new mining practices will show the world what it truly means to dig a mine."

Each goblin of Mountainshark tries to emulate the genius, the cunning, and the incredible violence which he showed us."

In exchange for being left mostly to their own machinations, they offer their services to the government as occasional advisors by bringing in new ideas from beyond the country.

 Y53_oyster_wars_desc:0 "In 1765, the Raheni colonies in Sarhal signed a pact to end oyster dredging around the gulf and consolidate each nation's competing oyster companies into a single monopoly. The city council of Prukakhin ignored the law and funded pirates to poach and dredge the oyster-rich waters. These transgressions led to the pirates battling local fishermen, providing an excellent training ground for future Prukakhin sailors to cut their teeth in the Oyster Wars."

 hill_yan_sheng_shan_desc:0 "The Sheng Shan are the holiest mounds in our lands; each one features an isolated monastery, the location of which is intended to bring the monks to closer contact with the spirits that flit around our homeland.

Our enemies cannot react to our swift strikes, letting us cut them down in droves. This speed also allows us to strike in unorthodox places, confusing our opponents and bypassing their defenses.\n\nThe reason we are the only nation to use this tactic is because it demands a special beverage that is made only in our temples, enhancing our warriors' endurance and agility and allowing for their extreme speed.

This both saves the spiritual lives of these men and makes them very loyal to our nation for lifting them out of poverty, giving us an unparalleled pool of manpower for our size.

This has led to an increase in breeding, as families breed their best to create finer offspring in a quest for glory.\n\nWhile these developments have only increased the quality of our herd by a bit, it has increased the quantity of elephants by an vast amount.

We focus on disorienting our enemies by making illusions of soldiers surrounding them, making it impossible to tell what is real and what is not. These illusions are made of the smoke of our special tobacco, making us superior to the typical conjurer reliant on intensive magical abilities.\n\nThis strategy has proven very effective, with many an enemy commander fleeing when outnumbered, only to discover later he faced but a few warriors."

Vast forests of seaweed host underneath the ocean grow, full of fish and monsters beyond explanation. This seaweed grows incredibly fast: whether it is from the magic of Aelantir or simply the fertile water is debated. Seaweed is harvested by the Kairncali in the oceans, but the vast majority of it is grown on terraced farms on land. The plentiful seaweed is often woven in flexible and tough sails, allowing for our ships to sail with ease and security of always having replacement sails."

These down-on-their-luck sailors can earn their place by lending us their services as soldiers.\n\nOf course, Kairncal's position has made it a valuable target for Cannorian powers, and in 1781 the Vanbury Guild forcibly gained Kairncal as a treaty port from Arakepruni control."

Sir Dalmund, known for his tendency to fix all his problems with the strike of a hammer founded the clan Runeback, who maintained the tradition of runesmithing. Lastly Sir Sindri, known for his infamous predicament as he tried to seduce a horse while drunk, founded the clan Glitterhoof who served as diplomats.\n\nThese clans came together to found the clan republic of Argezvale, using their strengths to complement one others glaring weaknesses and establish their new state on the Ynnic stage."

As it is difficult to inscribe every piece of equipment en-masse, it was only the most skilled of soldiers that had the privilege of bearing such powerful arms.\n\nOur runesmiths rival the skills of even the last remnant holds that still cling to life in the Dwarovar. The advent of artificery of the 17th century has improved our methods of runesmithing greatly, as new methods of runesmithing were discovered, leading to many inventions benefitting from our ancient craft.

With their methods, we can possibly improve on both styles of rune magic and meld the tradition into an improved craft.\n\nMany Veykodan refugees arrived in our lands after escaping from other Cannorians in the region, leading to our state providing space for refugee camps to form in the cities, which gradually turned into the Veykodan Districts. While many doubted this was a good decision at the time, quite a few Veykodans showed themselves useful by teaching us some of their runic craft in return, proving that acceptance always pays off.\n\nThis has led to both of our crafts being combined with each other, as the runic tattoos of the Veykodans increase one’s strength while dwarven runic armour protects them from arrowfire."

Not only can we utilise this for our own efforts, but we have also encouraged the locals to commission us for their needed projects across the Ynn.

Granting the Veykodans representation within our state was not an easy task, but we have slowly extended their citizenship rights in all of our settlements.\n\nAs our military might has been combined, we have improved their woolly rhinos into mounts for our dwarven cavalry, covered in runic plate armour to make them ever more devastating on the field.

Unfortunately, Jaerel's stance was only seen as a failure to choose a side, which saw many of his allies abandon him.\n\nTimes have changed, however, and as the world is led by the scions of Anbennar, a realm created to bring peace and equality, perhaps Haless is now ready to see that All Are Equals Beneath the Rising Sun."

While the concept of 'the weave' never reached wide-spread popularity, the Monks of the Weaving Palm proved incredibly deadly in battle, evoking arcane spells through movements and gestures akin to chi and cultivation practices, using nothing but their internal energies - the arcane 'weave' in the air - rather than spell reagents and components."

Silvelar's renown has been further bolstered by silver's - and, by extension, its - association with the Dame. More prosaically, the silver that Silvelar exports in such great quantities has ever been minted into currency, and has circulated far and wide across Cannor.

Over the centuries, the nobility waned and the burghers waxed, and things came to a head. The city was victorious, and when Anbennar was established in 1221, Silvelar acceded to it as a Free City, answerable only to the Emperor, the yoke of its old aristocrats lifted from its shoulders."

Formerly a colloquial term used to refer to a member of the Silver Families with a particularly bad reputation, the Tarnished eventually became associated with the guild that Lucian Silmuna founded and would later be used to refer to the entirety of the Silvelari underground, which was - by that point - dominated entirely by the Tarnished and their subordinates."

However, with the death of the first Harpy Queen Firanya, her bickering daughters established their own flocks, splitting the once unified Queendom into petty squabbling.\n\nSince then, many have tried to reestablish the once great realm but it was the flock of Ayara that has unified us for the final time against the now weakened Kingdom of Birzartanšes.

A select group specializing in silk production began to refer to themselves as the “Kanu", setting up shop in the city's east.

Long after the end of Tluukt Cleaver-of-Realm's dominance in the region, its legacy in Zanbar was clear: from the benign (women commonly found in positions of power) to the chilling (the casual use of violence to resolve disputes and satisfy desires).

Legend has it she hailed from a small village in northern Bulwar, prone to harpy raids. Her mother perished in childbirth and her father abducted in one such attack, she made her way to Zanbar, where her illustrious beauty and sharp wit saw her quickly become one of its most famous courtesans.

Upon the previous Akal's death without a clear heir, she marched towards the palace: beginning as a solitary figure with a tall spear, and ending at the head of a mass thousands-strong. Her claim was incontestable.\n\nAs Akal, she revitalized Kalib's merchant guilds, struck up a personal friendship with Taelarios Irrliazuir, and made sure every peasant knew they could aspire to greatness.

There, under the Imperial campaign tent, Erelessa, head of the Legion, presented a boy called Jaddar as the rightful heir to the Jaherian bloodline. His claim to succession was rejected by most leaders present, and he and most of the Legionaries went East into the Salahad. Meanwhile, Taelarios of Irrliam took the lead in splitting the Empire among the various Elves who all rose from governors to Kings.\n\nWhile the peace it created did not endure, with two more Cinder Wars in the 13th century, the Kalib partition made the city of Kalib famous, and paved the way for a diplomatic tradition the Kalibi are renowned for throughout Bulwar."

The battle was lost almost as soon as it began: elven blademasters overwhelmed by the dog-demons' numbers, human steel no match for the ferocity of tooth and claw. The allied forces began to turn tail and flee, but the Kalibi stood strong.\n\nEven as they fell by the dozens, the hundreds, they did not break, they did not budge.

They already know the secrets of silk-production, so there are no costs to letting them into Sardiphadin's inner-most sanctums, and they are sworn to protect their charge with their lives. At its peak, the Harimraj banned such practices, treating the Bhuvauri more as foe than friend, but as the ministries grew corrupt Sardiphadin was quick to take advantage. A number of companies have been on direct retainer from Bhuvauri for decades now, and these contracts are the bedrock of Sardiphadin's defenses.\n\nSome thought to reconsider this arrangement after the "Typhoon of Broken Vases" in 1699 AA, when the Bhuvauri were bribed by Lorent with vast sums of money and exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their employers in the Porcelain Cities (recompense for the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage).

From winning over the allegiance of many Ghankedheni, to divvying up the coast with the Bhuvauri, to trampling resistance underneath their desert steeds' fearsome hooves, few could stand before them. But although they were not heavy-handed in their rule, and sought to win over the populace with lavish festivals and generous policies, the Tudhinai chafed nonetheless.\n\nRooted in the Unbroken Claw school's long-standing grudge with the Radiant Sun, the shepherds were often late in their taxes, only paid lip service to Jadd rituals, and nigh-refused to join its legions. When the Deioderan came, tearing the Jadd Empire apart, they were some of the first to rebel against the East Jadd Empire — and the Nahana Jadd would never reconquer them."

But a few families in the region found the smoke-filled skies of West Rahen to be anathema to the skies they knew, the skies they had lived under for generations. These outcast Ghankedheni often found a new home just east, in Tudhina, where they could continue their pastoral way of life among a new people, and forge new families together with them."

He spoke of his visions, of the war between the Gods, the Darkness and the sacrifice Surakel made for his people and his never-ending fight. The old city of Vacyn welcomed Hammura the Wise who became the first kašra (priest) of Surakel and built the first temple, eduz, to his glory, giving a new name to the city.\n\nBulwar may have become the centre of the cult thanks to its huge population, but every true believer knows that the Cult was born in Eduz-Vacyn."

In 155, during the Harimraj’s invasion of Bulwar, Manava would utilise Davharral as the primary staging ground for the invasion, with the garrison’s infrastructure vastly expanded to accommodate extra troops and store additional supplies. \n\nNowadays, where once stood a loyal servant of the Raj guarding its frontier, there stands a fiercely independent state made rich by the flow of trade between Bulwar and Rahen.

The construction of the highway led merchants to pass through Davharral instead of along previous routes through Edesukeru and Simlardu. This saw Davharrali merchant families gain vast amounts of wealth, fostering the growth and development of infrastructure in the city.

It was not infallible, however, and would frequently require repairs over its lifespan. \n\nFollowing landslides in 1215 that destroyed much of the great aqueduct, local merchant Indranarayan of the Gilded Seal funded the construction of a college at the centre of Davharral to research new ways of acquiring fresh water. The school was one of the largest of its time and was built in lavish style, in line with Indranarayan's belief in Silk Turban teachings. \n\nOver the centuries, many great innovations would come from this school, including the ability to distil water and other liquids with glass and heat, as well as a breakthrough in water purification with lime. The latter discovery would result in Davharral converting all its buildings' roofs to a lime-cement mixture in the early industrial age, providing a consistent source of water for its people."

The guiding principles of wealth generation and investment for the betterment of the many would lead to the creation of many beautiful public works throughout the region.

They used these debts for decadent purposes and funding of wars, rarely investing them in the public good. This waste of funding would reach a breaking point in 1419, when the incompetent King of Dakmender lost a significant portion of his city’s wealth in gambling, sparking an economic crisis in Gebahiri. \n\nAs the crisis worsened, the Davharrali merchants called their debts, demanding payment in full, knowing well that Dakmender could not repay them. As the crown of Dakmender gave ever more concessions to extend their loan periods, the power of the Raheni merchants in the city grew. By the time the government officially defaulted in 1421, the Raheni merchants controlled the city in all but name. \n\nWithin a fortnight, the royal army of Davharral sailed across the gulf and marched into Dakmender, seizing control of the kingdom and exiling the royal house with minimal resistance. This coup and subsequent annexation, which would become known as the Acquisition of Dakmender, was the first chapter in the following bloody decade that would see most of Gebahiri come under rule by the Raghamideshi states."

Owned and family operated since 1473, it quickly became a landmark in Anzabad, and soon, all Bulwar."

Tribute payments are plentiful, as are monstrous raids, and everyone knows that the peace of a farming day might instantly turn to chaos and bloodshed.\n\nBut that is the space that, for generations, the Harklumi have made their lives in. It requires toughness — and the Harklumi are tough. It requires bravery — and the Harklumi are brave. Above all, it requires an indomitable will to persevere — something no Harklumi is born without."

 F36_community_nightwatch_desc:0 "Every scattered village in Harklum employs a similar system for common defence (those that did otherwise have since perished). Every member of the citizenry rotates through lookout duty, watching for threats and incoming raids. At times, this means a Harklumi citizen might go a week without ever seeing the sun, a daunting prospect for any Bulwari. It is considered a position of honor, however, for just as Surael's sun in the day is a symbol of the sacrifice He made to protect us from the Day of Ashen Skies, their keen eyes awake at night are a sacrifice for our common good."

They have been passed from generation to generation, protected from gnollish raids with blood and bone, and are still borne by Harklum's best soldiers to this day."

But as the gnolls were pushed back in the late 15th century, with the slaying of Zokka Devourer-of-Suns and the death of Tluukt Cleaver-of-Realms, more and more came to appreciate the land's abundant beauty. By the Age of Witch-Kings, many prominent Sun Elves owned vast and palatial estates in Harklum, rivalling in grandeur any of Marlliande's plantations or the Wine Lords' vineyards."

Whether it is wars or gnollish raids that leave a child parentless, to let them languish in orphanhood is a crime in the eyes of Surael. And so Harklum for centuries has given them a place in the army, the 'Childrens' Corps', so that they can find their purpose renewed and their light set ablaze. While this was traditionally constrained to Harklumi children, in the late 11th century an enterprising Akal sponsored orphanages across Bulwar, to ensure no child's light is dimmed for long."

But the challenges of life in Harklum mean many instead look inward, and see the lifespark that keeps the heart pumping and lungs breathing his truly greatest gift. And this belief is only reinforced by the Sunlily berry, one of the more interesting and curious plants native to the region.\n\nWhen consumed, the berry grants a man the energy to go through an entire day, requiring no other food and only a small libation of water. No doubt this is a small emanation of Surael himself, all his life-giving energies condensed into one small ounce of creation. It is what ensures we can tend our fields with care, despite our dispersed population and strife-rife lands."

He rallied the troops left to garrison the city, overthrew the governor and managed to carve himself a kingdom centered around the northern part of the Šad Sur.\n\nIn the following centuries, the small mountainous Akalate became richer and richer thanks to the gold mine in Šad Uraš and slave trade, until most of it fell in the early 9th century to a gnollish invasion led by Jix the Goldseeker.\n\nToday, the majority of the people of the Šad Sur have deserted the mountains due to the repeated gnollish raids, but the traditions forged by Barseen still remain."

Most of these were established in Zanšap for its temperate weather, particularly in the province of Surib.

The cultivation of the kasiyaru is so important to the Zanšapi economy and culture that it has long been one of its primary symbols, and even features on the Akalate's flag."

When Barseen took control of the place, it was little more than a pile of ruins. His son Bavar I, with his Akalate flourishing, ordered the restoration of the old fortress and turned it into a palace. As the excavations continued and more of the ruins were uncovered, the palace became a town, then a city, until it officially became the capital in the year 542."

He rose quickly in the ranks, imposing the guards' discipline on a small regiment of his own.

Setting up targets further and further away, they compete and hone one another.\n\nDeggarion was particularly keen on this game, and at the head of his own regiment, ensured every soldier learned a sniper's accuracy.

His head slowly began to grow — the man made it back to his village to proclaim wild theories of ascension, balance, and the meaning of life, before his brain burst like an overripe peach. But a few years later, it is rumoured, the true consequence of his wish came to fruition: construction began on a small library in Aqatbar.\n\nThat, of course, was millennia ago. For as long as any can remember, the Great Library of Aqatbar has been one of the vastest repositories of knowledge in all Halcann, with records dating back to the Age of God-Kings.

From the merchant fleets of Re-Uyel and Crathánor, to the sunshine galleys of Anzabad, and even Jexis's old armada (now resurrected by Elizna), every ship in Bulwar has been built in the shipyards of Bahar, or at least with wood coming from its many forests."

But after the Burned Empress's death, amidst the chaos of Jexisian civil war, they made a decision as poor as that prior one had been wise: siding with Elizar, whose sole focus was on revenge against Ioriel, they were abandoned when Birzartanšes struck in a war of subjugation. As a final indignity, King Birzartan I put his brother Eletar on the throne of Baharšes, now renamed Baharkand.\n\nThey would not regain their freedom for a full generation, when they fought a brutal independence war, watering the forests and hills with blood as they used guerrilla tactics to secure their freedom.

Eighard mobilized against this threat in time to defeat the invaders, and joined with Einnsag's coalition to defeat Raithtall to stop their meddling.

Thinking the Eordan savages who would be easy to dispatch with their advanced weaponry, the Guild fleet fell into a carefully prepared trap. When their sailors were loading the ammunition into the guns, the Einnsagger druids summoned a storm that drenched the enemy. No ordinary storm, the rain still contained the brine of the sea, not just a nuisance but corroding the gears and making their weaponry unsafe to fire.

In a different timeline, Ladrana would be remembered as the uniting matriarch of the Tuathak: but she was already too late and did not notice their eminent demise.\n\nWhilst the Tuathak leaders were gathered in Dorcurt, a Peitar army struck from the depths of the Domandrod. The folly of Dorcurt was the assumption that no large forces could arrive from the Domandrod because of the restrictions on entry enforced by the Gladewardens and fey spirits within. The Tuathak Legion guards were quickly overwhelmed, unprepared to fight such a large force so quickly, and almost all those gathered at the conclave were murdered by the balance-obsessed zealots. The Sonad of Raithtall, Urian Oakgardner fought to avenge his comrades, but was pierced with a poisoned blade. Miraculously, Urian was recovered and returned to Raithtall by a trusted compatriot, but lived the last few years of his life infirm and in constant pain.

The ancient Armonadhi were not Eordan and from the Domandrod: instead being survivors from the cataclysm that wrecked long ago, shielded by their namesake mountains. Armonadhi tools and artifacts have been found in the hinterlands by wandering miners, but Snecboth history tells of how the Armonadhi met their end. The Snecboth, while recognizing that all seasons are not equal but unwise in trusting the cold death of Winter, migrated to Galbhan and Armonadh. The ancient Armonadhi fought back against the Snecboth, but could not handle face the superior magic and equipment preserved from our Domandrod heritage.'\n\n'As the reader should be aware of already, Slegcal was founded by Tuathak Hibernal Crusaders after the ambush at Minnorac shattered the Crusade's leadership. Our founder, Ewandil Firstborn recognized the promise of this land and that the clergy of Eighard would have no say over our new realm. Ewandil pacified the unruly Snecboth by instituting a fair taxation system: those that do not recognize the superiority of Autumn over all else may be permitted to live in peace in exchange for an increased tithe. Some saw the light of Autumn, but Slegcal is still home to a sizable population of the Winter Court adherents.'\n\n'The next time you walk through Slegcal harbor, or hike through the Armonadh mountains, remember that everything you see is our heritage.' - An excerpt from the Slegcaler's Guide, a popular history and encyclopedia used in Slegcaler schools."

However, its beauty did not impress the ever-fickle Fey, who were instead threatened by its ability to injure draconic and fey creatures. The fey demanded that it be destroyed; the Gladewarden who forged the sword refused and fled with it beyond the Armonadh mountains, never to return.\n\nCenturies later, Darran Eaglesthorn set Slegcal on a mad quest to retrieve Dracball. Contact with the peoples of the Ynnic river valley spread tales of Dracball, supposedly having slain a mighty dragon at war with the Rzentur centuries ago! Raising his host in the far north near the Broken Sea in 1782, Darran Eaglesthorn marched into Dragon Dominion lands towards Arganjuzorn, intent on retrieving the legendary sword. While the Rzentans proved to be untrustworthy vassals, breaking their oaths near instantly, the people of Arganjuzorn recognized their status as subjects to Slegcal. Agreements were made with the Dragon Dominion to allow Slegcaler movement along the upper Ynn, and the first Eordan embassy was established in Svemel.\n\nAt last victorious, Darran drew Dracball from its hilt and spent nearly a month testing it against the monsters of the Epednar plains, including slaying a mighty Poskawa Whale, a gigantic mountain-like fish monster that blends into the rockfields. When news of Cannorian mercenaries invading Slegcal reached Darran, he returned home to face off these invaders but was already too late. Darran Eaglesthorn met his end speared with bayonet during the defense of Eirminn, clutching the bloodied legendary blade beyond death until his fingers were cut off by a looter. It is said that the Juzornic lords assembled their retinues alongside Darran, hoping that Slegcal may prove an invaluable ally against both Ynnic and Cannorians. Nestrin Farsight, Slegcal's ambassador to the Dragon Dominion and trusted representative in Arganjuzorn, still rules over their vassalized domain and has campaigned to assemble a coalition to drive the Cannorians out of the Ynn and his homeland."

Their obsession with preserving Autumn served well for a time, causing stagnation and division between the Tuathak states. However, they began to talk of unity to defeat the Winter Court in their holy war, a case far too dangerous to ignore. The Eordellon faithful agreed and assembled an army to quell their unity, and were granted passage through the Domandrod by the Fey Lords for enforcing the balance.\n\nGathered in their seditious conclave, the leaders of the Autumn Court were an easy target to eliminate, for Dorcurt lies not far from the Domandrod's obscuring borders. Their guards quickly put down, their leaders were tied in place where they could helplessly watch their golden trees burn and their people slaughtered.

Despite their obsession with trivial matters, the Arakepruni had amassed great knowledge, population, and the wealth to use them. To combat this threat the Iadthi allied with a useful Spring heretic: Manaron Goldtree of Elchos, vassal of Arakeprun. Goldtree sought to liberate his possessions from the clutching grasp of the Arakepruni scholar-clergy, and garnered support from across Arakeprun's nobility to stage an armed rebellion.\n\nPelomar, always imagining themselves the great hero of old, took this as the prime opportunity to weaken their rival, while Iadth allied with the upstart Elchosi for purely practical matters of resolving our volatile border with Arakeprun. The border territory of Tasmet had long been disputed between Dorcurt and Arakeprun, but Iadth had no use for the Autumnal heretics that dwelt there. When war was raised against Arakeprun, Iadth's armies performed their duty enough to seize victory for the Goldtree Rebellion... but a deal was struck to concede Tasmet to Arakeprun to secure peace until Iadth could secure its place."

The Peitar tribes gathered to discuss what action to take to curb the expansion of the Autumn Court, and designated Strutmar with the responsibility to take their main force head-on. Hopelessly outmatched, the Strutmari waited and watched for an opportunity... and found one when the leadership of the Hibernal Crusade was gathered by the Esbagg of Eighard at Minnorac, the Field of Oaths, to swear loyalty to him.\n\nTheir Tuathak Legions, heavily armored and disciplined phalanxes, stood watch towards the cold forest whilst their commanders bowed and prostrated.

Bluewool is sheared from the wooly horned sheep native to the Egasach, although only a few out of every hundred grow blue wool.

While some say it is because of their reverence and dedication to Winter rewarding them, and others claim it is because of an absurd combination of soil, rainfall, and wind conditions, it is with no doubt that Marathmas is one of the grandest cities in the north, and may yet surpass Gemradcurt itself."

The brothers, seeking an opportunity of a lifetime, asked to build a center of artificery led by them. The dragon, who usually masqueraded in ruinborn form, seeing the practical use of artificery and perhaps kinship with his misbegotten cousins, granted their wish.

By the time it did, this composite army was already too big to not give it support without risking having their holding sacked for “standing in the way of the Dragon's will". Some of those lords gave the army supplies and safe passage through their lands, while others joined the totality of their force to them.\n\nThis army, despite being massive, was heavily infantry based, as well as plagued by organisation issues.

Sizapzarko, on the other hand, would lend to anybody, particularly those with a shortsighted desire to get rich from adventuring. Either they succeeded and the incredibly high rates meant Sizapzarko made a huge profit, or they failed and became perilously indebted. This allowed them to show support for the city they helped found with much more lenient rates."

 R61_vamayurs_codex_desc:0 "A popular saying in Pasiragha is "he who fought, lost; he who wrote, won." It stems from the tale of King Vamayur: his father, Brajar, was a major harimari warlord who competed with Harimar himself during the early post-ascension days. He lost a paw in a duel to the soon-to-be Emperor, however, and his wound festered until he died in 21 AA.\n\nHis son, Vamayur, was more talented with pen and parchment than sword and shield, and came to Harimar's attention just as he was beginning to be faced with the challenges of governance. Vamayur was instrumental in drafting the Harimraj's first set of laws and ordinances, many of which are still in force today. It was for this service that his dynasty earned the lands of Pasiragha, and furthermore, through intricate loopholes and clever designs he ensured it a place of prominence in the court beyond its seeming stature.\n\nVamayur compiled his lessons and wisdom into a tome, Vamayur's Codex, which was passed down from generation to generation, and from senapti to senapti during the latter Harimraj. Though said to be secret, over the centuries a few copies were made — finding their way into a certain estate's bookshelves in Sramaya, and a constant guide to the young Senapti Mahapalar of the Flower Oath — and once the printing press arrived in Rahen, it was disseminated far and wide. But even so, few study Vamayur's Codex as closely, or commit large chunks to memory, as those in Pasiragha."

Even amidst the turmoil of 16th and 17th century Rahen, the palace only grew and thrived: it was where the Nahana Jadd defined its tenets, became a hub for Raheni artificery, and by the early 19th century one could find scholars from as far afield as Konwell and Aqatbar joining its lively debates."

Philosophers and comics alike turned to political cartoons as a way of expressing their thoughts on contemporary affairs. These quickly became a staple of the Raheni political scene, and by the early 1700s, a pamphlet printed in Pasiragha could be found inspiring debate and discussion in Srayen or Sarisung within days of its creation."

Within it, the porcelain workers felt safe to revel in their riches. But everything changed when Harimar attacked.\n\nThough the walls were insurmountable, the gates were not. The harimari troops quickly breached the city's mighty gates, and quickly overran its defences. But Harimar was a benevolent conqueror, and he saw the value of a kind example in bringing the rest of the Porcelain Cities under his paw. Instead of sacking the city, he allowed its rulers to proclaim him sovereign. Then, before he left, he ensured the shattered gates would be rebuilt out of pure porcelain, a shining white beacon so that all would remember how quickly he had seized the city — and his mercy afterward.\n\nThe days of the old Harimraj are long gone now, but the White Gate still stands, the symbol of Khiraspid and harder than any wood or stone. And though hobgoblins threaten from the north, zealots threaten from the east, Khiraspid's White Gate will stand strong, nigh-insurmountable, against them."

Not a single individual, no matter their fitness or position, is allowed to shun this duty, and it ensures that Khiraspid never goes without a well-manned guard.\n\nThe other Porcelain Cities often looked down on this practice, which meant an apprentice porcelain-worker would share a spear with a street urchin, especially when mercenary forces and Bhuvauri slave soldiers were well-trained, plentiful, and cheap. But it would pay off in 1699 AA, when following the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage, Lorent paid the Bhuvauri a vast sum and promised them exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their would-be masters and sack the city of Keyattordha. That city was left ravaged, and the slave soldiers also looted a few others as they abandoned the Porcelain Guilds' contracts in full. After the "Typhoon of Broken Vases", as the event became known, Khiraspid alone stood untouched."

 H51_the_bond_breaker_desc:0 "Cursed Ones have been a constant opponent of half-orcs even during Varbuk's initial crossing of the forest, in part due to Kinbond - a telepathic link that allows Cursed Ones to communicate with each other at a distance. Fortunately, Freemarches wasn't the only country with desire to tame the forest.\n\nGnomes from the Broken Sea faced the same problem of Cursed Ones' raids and resistance. To combat them, they invented the Bond Breaker - a small metallic rod that operates at the same frequency as Kinbond, distracting and confusing the affected Cursed Ones for a short period of time. The rod however could work only at a short distance. In order to properly test and utilise this new invention gnomes needed to get close enough to the Cursed Ones.\n\nNot willing to waste their own lives for this, the artificers contacted Freemarches with an offer. They would employ some half-orcs and have them venture into the forest alongside gnomish expeditions to act as a protection against the Cursed Ones, and in return gnomes would provide some Bond Breakers for Freemarcher use. Half-orcs accepted gnomish offer, and this dual endeavor greatly decreased half-orcish losses against their old enemies."

These ambitious men took their skill in rearing cattle south, establishing the ranches that would become Cowskeep as centers of meat and leather production.\n\nThe Bull Barons kept close ties with their northern neighbor, providing Butterburn with hardy studs for their cattle herds. This partnership would eventually blossom into the Turnwell League, an economic and defensive alliance between the western halfling lands. Though foreign in origin, Cowskeepers have gotten so used to their rule that the Bull Barons continued to hold key positions of power, long after the League fell apart in 1208.

While archaeologists admire the Bullsmead Mound for its insights into the daily life of ancient halflings, it more importantly established the precedent of governments paying landowners for archaeological excavations, making farmers more open about their findings."

When goblins first invaded this region during the Exodus they made no attempts to learn any of these foreign languages. As they began transitioning from roaming hordes to proper states and interacting with the locals more frequently the problems of communication became clear as day. Initially, Overclan's government proposed the creation of a new language by combining all those present in Bahar, but it was deemed an unnecessary waste of time and effort.\n\nThe actual solution was the employment of non-goblins who taught goblin administrators, diplomats and rulers in those local languages, while encouraging all others to follow suite. Having a polylingual administration was a sure way of securing both Bahari population's support and making diplomacy easier."

Very few were willing to work for these former invaders, especially in the bureaucracy, as that meant having a near constant contact with goblins. An intriguing solution was proposed by Overboss Dramkork in 1529 - raising orphans as bureaucrats. Many locals have lost their families during the Decades of Devastation, Goblin Exodus and during the Samartal investigations and were left with nothing, fighting for scraps on the streets. Overclan provided those children with shelter and food, in hopes the children would work for them.\n\nThe program was a success, with the Overclan raising a proper bureaucratic force within just a decade, which was fully utilised in the subsequent Bahari-wide programs.\n\nA large portion of said orphans was made of Voltoj - half-goblins, who were not always orphans, but castaways from their families. While some human orphans held hatred for goblins, blaming them for their condition, Voltoj unanimously embraced the Overclan and each other as their new family."
 F78_volunteer_militia:0 "Volunteer Militia"

Those were mostly made of indebted peasants and soldiers, both of which were disillusioned with Elven rule and hostile to the invading goblins, who plagued the countryside and occasionally even raided the larger cities.\n\nAfter goblins have secured their rule in Bahar, many of human adventurers turned to banditry as well. Those former adventurers did not recognise Overclan and saw goblins as mere monsters, harassing any goblin controlled cities and punishing non-goblins for what they saw as supporting the enemy.\n\nThe issue was resolved only following the formation of Overclan. Scouring of the bandits became the first truly united effort in the Overclan, with goblin, human and even some elven veterans working together to end this issue. The proposed solution was the creation of a volunteer militia, which was trained in combined goblin-human-elven tactics and spread throughout the region. The volunteers consisted primarily of those directly affected by the bandits.\n\nWhile Overclan's main armies were focused on securing the integrity of this newfound nation, the militia secured its internal stability by fighting the bandits, while also trying to convince adventurers to stop the raids. The bandit plague met its final end in 1547, when the volunteer militia cleared out the occupied citadel of Azka-szel-Azka, which has been used by bandits as a safe haven. The militia was not disbanded however, and continued patrolling the Bahari countryside since."

In order to do that however goblins needed to atone for the damage caused by their Exodus. That was done with a 37 year long process known as the Decades of Restoration.\n\nWhile primarily Decades of Restoration focused on restoring razed buildings, rejuvenating old farms and resettling abandoned villages, its primary function was to convince other races of Bahar to accept goblin rule. The first few goals were achieved relatively easily, but the racial integration saw heavy resistance. The solution came in a form of Voltoj.\n\nFollowing the creation of a new bureaucracy made out of orphans, half-goblins became an integral part of the Overclan administration and actively participated in the Decades of Restoration. Local Bahari preferred working with more humane looking Voltoj than goblins. Seeing this, the Overclan decided to nearly entirely transfer the integration part of the program to the half-goblins. As expected, half-goblins made considerably better effort in securing good relations with other races, further increasing their standing within the Overclan as they were seen as a thematic representation of Overclan's racial syncretism."

Before the unification of Bahar however, goblin navies were the weakest in the Divenhal, having been sunk by human, elven and dwarven navies on numerous occasions. Once the Overclan formed and integrated other races' designs into their own, the goblin fleet became a common sight in the Divenhal.\n\nDuring the early 1600s, a goblin writer Zyt the Short wrote a history of the goblinkind, in which he claims that goblins have previously conquered two frontiers - the caves of the Serpentspine and the forests of Escann - and that now Exodus Goblins have begun the conquest of the ocean, also known as the Third Frontier. Unsurprisingly, this thought became popular in the Overclan, partially as a reaction to recent successes of Bayvek and Mestikardu, two other seafaring goblin nations.

The religion and conversion to it were heavily promoted by the government. Yet Ravelianism only became popular with goblins, with nearly all remaining shamanists having chosen to convert and adopt Ravelian teachings and encouraging Cannorian artificers to move to Bahar.

Amarien, the general of Jaher who had successfully ended the harpy raids in the area by burning the nest of the Sad Kuz in her liberation of the Gelkari shepherds, was awarded the fortress of Birsartansbar and the title of governor of Imulušes in 1009.\n\nMost saw it as a bad joke played by her close friend, given it was the weakest governorship of the new empire with the lands it encompassed in a pitiful state. But Amarien saw an opportunity in this devastation: she decided to recruit many of the elves that could not fight in the Legions, or who had already fought but had gotten injured (and left without a manor tended by humans to retire to), to immigrate to her lands. There they toiled the fields, rebuilt whole villages and cities and sponsored a strong elven culture in the hills and mountains\n\nNowadays, nowhere in Bulwar one finds so many sun elves as in Birzartanšes.

But given Birzartanšes' many copper mines, and the tragedies of the internecine Birzartanšesi-Baharkandi war (1419-1423) and the following Dartaxes rebellion (1422-1436), it seemed to many that artillery would be safer than relying on mages.\n\nThe first great cannon of the Birzartanšes army was built by a dwarven engineer from Ovdal Tûngr named Ungrim Thunderhammer, and was at the time the biggest artillery piece outside the Dwarovar. Called Ordalanner in honor of his creator, the cannon was so massive it needed 50 oxen to be moved. This great weapon was instrumental in the siege of the great Dartaxerdim fortress of Kuzak in 1484, its fire shattering the walls in a way only the most powerful of archmages could match.\n\nThe country's early interest was only furthered as artillery progressed over the years, and as the safety of operating a cannon increased, the need for human or dwarven engineers was soon replaced by Sun Elves, who became experts in operating the machinery and the black powder.

They would do so by passing an examination that was the same for everybody, everywhere in the kingdom.\n\nThe new class of bureaucrats was still predominantly elven and from the old aristocracy, for only they could spend entire years studying for the examinations, but the testing process allowed the state to remove the corrupt and unsuitable administrators that had plagued it."

The most popular one concerned Dartaxes' father and helped explain to many why this human family had grown to become officers in the Birzartanšesi army, even though Dartaxes himself denied it publicly. To ensure that this problem grew no further, the Jaherian Exemplars in Birzartanšes were tasked to apply the ‘Cleanliness of Blood' Edict, or in Sun Elven 'Silsun Sirad', which required every person applying to serve the state to demonstrate a pure ancestry in either human or elven blood.\n\nThe role of these Exemplars expanded over the years as they began to examine human villages and quarters for individuals who looked "too elven". By the late 1500s, their power was so great that they could even dare to publicly target a prince of the royal family. Taelar, grandson of Arantir and minor prince of the royal family, was caught in an affair with the palace singer and dancer Emmita Nuartu, and got her pregnant.

Prominent figures gather for a soirée during which they wear elaborate masks, drink the finest Jaherian Sunlight, and dance to the sound of famous bands from all over Bulwar.

The Decades of Devastation, along with the Samartal disaster and subsequent investigations, showed to Birzartanšes' rulers that they lacked an efficient way to gather intelligence over their enemies and also in their own country.\n\nThus was created the Pink Cabinet in 1530, headed by Arfil Fajazuir, the elf who had first uncovered the truth of the Samartal tragedy, but had been sidelined by his superiors.

What would allow the Phoenix to rekindle its flames? It would be creating the perfect state, and putting the needs of the state above all else.\n\nShe was the one to craft the now famous ‘Kuil szel-Laded' (‘State Reason') philosophy, the idea that immoral actions could be justified if the state required it. No alliance, no scheme is impure for the ruler of Birzartanšes as long as it allows the state to protect its subjects."

One of the striking differences between Kuzarami and the rest of Bulwar is that the most important prayer of the day is not made at dawn but at the twilight, the Kuzarami praying for Kuza to regrow and help them fight the Darkness in their hearts. And every lunar month when the Moon disappears, the Kuzarami lighten their homes and the whole mountains and pray for two days for Kuza to reappear.

But the mountain clans were deeply loyal to the Amarienzuir dynasty, for it was Amarien of Imulušes that had burnt the last harpy nests in the mountains and freed the Kuzarami.

One aged leader, terrified of the plight that had befallen his clan, made a bargain with the harpies: they would receive the dead of the village but promise to not eat the living.

His poem ‘Utur-Irnitu' (Great Success) made the phrase famous throughout Bulwar as he boasted at how pathetic the Gelkari were in their endeavors compared to the mighty Kuzarami.\n\nMaking enemies everywhere he went, he was forced to travel throughout his life and decided one day to leave for Aelantir.

As the nomads deliberated what to do with the deposed god-king, one of the Djinn from the Salahad arrived in the city. She said to the chieftain that the only way to deal with Amussu was imprisoning him for all eternity, and that she was willing to lead a group of warriors to a place where they could build a prison and guard it.\n\nThe warriors doubted the sincerity of the Djinn, whose interest seemed to be to prevent the rise of new genie-binders. But they accepted the offer, and thus, Ardeth and his kin followed the Djinn to the most distant reaches of the Salahad, when they found an oasis in the depths of a basin surrounded by mountains. There, in the deepest section of the gorge, they build a prison for the god king. Neither Ardeth or their kin ever returned to the eastern plains or the banks of the Suran; they never witnessed the glory of Karqašlu or the darkness of the age of monsters. They stayed in the Nihruqalu, the Silent Hall. Standing guard. Protecting a land that they will never inhabit.\n\nBut at some point their numbers dwindled, and they had to interact with the Salahadesi nomads that would become the Mašnih. They showed to their leaders the unkillable evil that they watch over. The tribal leaders offered to send warriors to nurture the ranks of the szal-Ardeth, and since then, when needed, the wardens recruit both men and women from the other tribes.

To better fight the gnolls they have developed a trademark cavalry tactic: They divide their forces in two groups, and while one harasses the gnolls with arrows and fake retreats, the other surrounds them and crush them in a cavalry charge.\n\nThe tribe claims to be descended from Yazkur the Zanite, a warrior that fought in Maqet's rebellion against the gnolls, almost a hundred years before the arrival of the Sun Elves. While most of the former slaves fled south and formed the kingdom of Dasmazar, Yazkur and several warriors stayed and managed to occupy the Harra oasis for a decade, before being expelled by the gnolls.\n\nAnother great clan member was Ekrem szal-Yazkur, who lost an arm fighting Zokka, and during the Battle of Sun's Providence, tried to kill the Pack-Lord before Jaddar could.

For twelve years he survived, until one night, he and other magi managed to escape. How? Nobody knows, but the group fled to the east, trying to reach Rahen. Many were lost in the desert, and one by one died, until only Fazil and eight more remained. They would not have survived if not for their stumbling upon the lost city and its oasis. There they found the knowledge of Ancient Bulwar, and they decided to keep it safe until the Bulwari were free to practice magic in their own home. They adopted a silver nine point star as sigil, representing the nine original magi and the brightest star in the night sky, Fazil.\n\nThe szal-Fazil are renowned for their wisdom and use of magic, and their magi are usually found in other tribes as advisors. The future leader of the tribe, Kuridon szal-Fazil, was living between the szal-Zaid at the same time as Jaddar began his campaign, and the two became close friends.

Even after conquest, legions of Lightbringers could not stamp out this rebellious spirit, and the city remained firmly (if quietly) defiant of the Jadd.

When she arrived at the court of the Akal, the royal consort was suffering from an unknown illness. Within two days, she had discovered that the illness came from the fungi growing at her weekend manor, and was able to derive a cure. Immediately after, she was hired as the physician extraordinaire for all Akals of Avamezan since."

The gnolls of Zokka's pack were even worse - those even suspected to be capable of magic were taken away, assuredly to be sacrificed in fiendish rituals.\n\nThough Hašr was never the most strict about enforcing the elven mandate, all of it came to change once the Jadd liberated us from the gnolls. Finally, those humans with magical talent were able to practice their craft openly, and our humble lands quickly became a home for those with magical capabilities. Originally taught by converted elves, magical tutelage was soon formalized and mages trained within Hašr have been responsible for winning countless battles for the light of the Jadd."

The leader of this resistance was an individual named Marudeen szal-Akur, known as the "Hašr Hawk", and he was - and still is - one of the most popular figures in the area. Upon hearing of Zokka's death, they mobilized the entire country for a rising against the gnolls and what seemed to be the invading elves.\n\nCalmer minds prevailed, and the Hašr Hawk was eventually coaxed into requesting an audience with Jaddar himself. He came away from this meeting a fervent follower of the Jadd, and the endorsement of the Hawk was enough to bring much of the country over to feel similarly. His legacy might be seen even today, for the Hašr are some of Surael's most unconditional followers."

This rule found itself unenforced under the chains of the Devourer-of-Suns, for the simple survival of any with elven blood was enough of an accomplishment to spill any of it, diluted or otherwise. Though born of necessity, this tolerance became deliberate under the Jadd, and the mingling of races seen as just another piece of the plan for them all.\n\nThis tolerance did not go unnoticed by the inhabitants of the akalates - an exodus to Hašr was far more appealing, and far easier, for any refugee half-elves than any other. The cultural and intellectual skillbase of these high-elves allowed Hašr to flourish. Even now, we are able to draw more advisors from those who others have shunned."

It is said that Zokka Devourer-of-Darkness could not convince a regiment from Hašr to follow him until he had farmed lentils for over a year, and could coax their riches out of the soil as naturally as any farmer.\n\nThough many in the Empire would hesitate to use force to subjugate the wicked, the denizens of Hašr have no such qualms.

Exploration of this chamber discovered faded magical relics and, more importantly, a series of spell tablets. Divination-dated to shortly after Jaher's conquest of Far Bulwar, these spell tablets appeared to be the buried research of a figure whose name could not be found.\n\nRegardless of who they were, their genius was unprecedented - the spells within this shrine were all of destructive power, in ways never even considered otherwise.

Instead, they largely govern themselves according to the teachings of Mula Swift-Sparrow, prophetess and granddaughter of the legendary Siaduna Flaming-Talon. Mula's teachings, which focused on cooperation, persuasion, and diplomacy were long derided as a weak philosophy of an impractical dreamer, but the sky matriarchs of distant Mulen do not see it this way.

These two groups rarely fight with each other, but when such conflicts do occur it is the harpies of Mulen who war with the plains-dwellers and drive them back across the pass.\n\nTheir centuries of fighting against centaurs, swift and powerful warriors who could kill with one firm blow, have led to the warriors of Mulen favoring evasive and defensive techniques. Practicing a fighting style that focuses on the preservation of its warriors' lives and cautious behavior sets the tactics of Muleni flocks apart from most other harpies, but has served them well when fighting foes physically much stronger than they."

Even the desert elves, who laid ancient Siadanlen low, have lessons to teach, for they espouse a message of tolerance and coexistence not unlike that of Mula Swift-Sparrow.\n\nThough we may not be trusted for the reputation our foremothers have built for us, the lure of these lessons is great. When we descend upon the caravans of the Golden Highway, the traders expect us to come as raiders, but we must be more than bandits if we are to grow as a people despite our isolation.

Though trade would at first be tentative and trust slow to come, the harpies of Mulen would prove to be willing traders and adept merchants, their descent upon merchant caravans not a sign of ill omen but instead good fortune and glad tidings, exchanging raw gems for worked materials and supplies for their miners, who could dig in cramped spaces that the harpies could not navigate. More and more, by the early 17th century AA, the sight of harpies winging their way across the skies of the Far Salahad was a sign of good fortune instead of ill, and though many still distrusted them, the appearance of the winged traders was a well documented phenomenon that few ignored."

Sculpted of brick and stone, the cities were oriented for harpy travel, and featured unique architecture that allowed walking as well as easy arrival and departure via flight, and the cities were planned with three-dimensional movement in mind. Beyond just the breathtaking vistas and vertigo-inducing drops, the hanging cities of Mulen featured baths, gardens, libraries, and great markets, and many a merchant made treks to these remote isolated towns, as much for the lure of the riches they contained as the experience of having witnessed the wonder of the Siadunan Sky-Cities."

Shattered by Jaher's onslaught, the roosts fell one by one, and countless sisters were killed by the self-proclaimed Sun God. But the years have been long since the Phoenix Emperor cast down the Matriarchy, and the elves are weak and off-balance from decades of infighting.

Those who fell under her rule found the Ivoryfeather to be far from a sadistic tyrant, however - and all those who were willing to regularly pay their tithes of finished goods or specialty knowledge were dealt with fairly under her Matriarchy.\n\nIt was during the days of the Ivoryfeather that the greatest symbol of the Siadunian Harpies was crafted - the Crest of Ishtara, a magnificent crown of gold, gemstones, and the matriarch's own feathers, a diadem as radiant as the rising sun, crafted by a dozen captive dwarven artisans.

The penetrating power of the arquebus, meanwhile, allowed the harpies to circumvent the weakness of their shortbows if the problems of long-range accuracy on these early muskets could be overcome. Always militaristic and willing to adopt new tactics, the Siadunan harpies experimented with arquebuses captured in their raids along the golden highway and began to modify their formation flying for firearm tactics in the later 16th century. Young harpies of Siaden would be trained in gunpowder warfare starting at a early age to familiarize themselves with using such weapons on the wing or standing, and the great accuracy cultivated by these youths would be a boon to the Free Matriarchs of Siadan in their long war of resistance against the Jaddari Desert Phoenixes. Delivering devastating volleys on the flanks of an enemy to demoralize or stagger a front line before plunging into the line with razor talons, the harpies of Siadan proved that the Mistresses of the Skies could and would remain formidable foes in the new age of powder warfare that was dawning on Halcann."

While Varilor's long rule is remembered as a prosperous one, his longest-lasting legacy was in his treatment of humans who lived in eastern Damesear.\n\nWhen other Elfrealms maintained their elven purity - or intermingled to such an extent that they no longer were true Elfrealms - Varilor ensured that the Damerians were able to continue their separate existence under his lordship, leading to Varivar becoming unique among the Elfrealms of Cannor for retaining minority elven rule over a human majority. Interestingly, this led to Varivar becoming a haven for not only elves, but for all races, in spite of the apparent disproportionate rule."

The largest of these shipbuilders, the Bluewood Arsenal, became famous for producing some of the finest ships in the Dameshead, the vast majority of which went to supply Dameria's 'Wooden Wall'."

 Z42_cult_of_the_moonsinger_desc:0 "Since Munas' deification in 1022, he has been the most popular deity in Varivar, in part due to the Bluetongues sparing no expense when his cult was established, and since he was the most relevant deity for Varivarians' livelihoods, being the god most associated with sailing. The fact that many of Varivar's elves had personally known Munas in life and held great respect for him also played a role, of course.\n\nFor almost five centuries, the Temple of Munas at Varivar remained the center of the Moonsinger's veneration, being eclipsed in importance by the Great Temple of Ibevar only after the temple's sacking by the Wexonards in the aftermath of Dameria's dismantlement. Even after Varivar's conversion to Ravelianism, Munas' worship continued on, with the 16th day of Esmarment being an annual holiday to mourn Munas' death and celebrate his life."

The Varivarians spearheaded a Silmunist movement among Dameria's former subjects that sought to restore Silmuna rule over Dameria's former lands. Wexonard attempts at curtailing the Silmunist movement through violence simply pushed the loyalists underground, giving rise to the Shadowmoon Conspiracy."

 Z42_seaforts_of_damesear_crossing_desc:0 "While the seaside fortifications in the county of Eargate tend to be overlooked due to Acromton's fame as the 'Crossguard', they are no less important for Damesear's security. Since Eargate has traditionally served as the Damesear's first line of defence in the east, the fort of Eargate has throughout the years been upgraded to stay up to date with advancing technology and hosted a small order of battlemages that provided the fortifications with much-needed firepower prior to the age of gunpowder. However, as naval batteries grew more advanced, the seafort on the tiny island of Floodtower Pass grew more important, since it had the ability to intercept any vessel trying to cross the sea to Damesear.\n\nThese fortifications proved crucial during the Corinite Wars, where the water batteries and the battlemages of the seaforts stopped the Corinite League's navies' advance to Damesear, and would have posed a significant obstacle for Camir's invasion of Anbennar, were it not for the sabotage of the fortifications by the Shadowmoon Conspiracy."
 Z42_marines_of_varivar:0 "Marines of Varivar"
 Z42_marines_of_varivar_desc:0 "Varivar's dependence on the sea for its income and trade connections left it particularly vulnerable to raids by the various warlord states that emerged during the Interregnum. In response, Varilor's successor, Erondil Bluetongue, established a dedicated naval infantry company in 1207 to protect Damesear's coasts and merchant fleet from foreign incursions. First of its kind in the world, Varivar's Marín Company would go on to become the blueprint after which the other marine corps of Cannor were modeled, and even named after.\n\nIn the aftermath of Varivar's annexation, the unemployed marines entered the services of foreign fleets as naval officers and drill sergeants, or formed freelance mercenary companies, such as Laochri síl na Már or the Dameshead Marine Company. From the first landings of Lorentish forces in Noruin, to the Gnomish Hierarchy's invasion of Eordand, these 'free marines' would be vital to the success of countless amphibious assaults, and would eventually form the basis of Anbennar's Imperial Marine Corps."
 Z42_sustainable_development_act:0 "Sustainable Development Act"
 Z42_sustainable_development_act_desc:0 "As artificery gave rise to industrialisation, Varivar came to struggle with questions of the impacts on nature of industrialisation and urbanisation. On one hand, Varivarians valued their forests and did not want to see them being destroyed by these rampant developments. On the other hand, Varivar's earlier proto-industrialisation had made the region wealthy by Imperial standards, with windmills, shipbuilding, and clothmaking generating an export economy that rivaled those of much larger duchies.\n\nVarivar took a third path, spearheaded by economist and former forester Aveline síl Marionaire: sustainable development. Based on the forest management laws of 1654, which combated the overexploitation of forests for timber with mandatory forest replantings and logging regulations, Aveline proposed an economic policy organising Varivar's economy to ensure that living conditions and the economy's needs were met without undermining the stability of nature. Although the Sustainable Development Act was implemented only at a local level, it nonetheless led to Varivar being the sole voice of sustainable design in the Empire against the chorus of maximised industrialisation, and led to Varivar becoming the center of nature conservation and environmentalist movements in Cannor."

 Z99_sorcerer_king_desc:0 "In the cosmology of the Black Doctrine, all beings with the capability to use magic are positioned somewhere in a great chain of ascension, sometimes called the 'Ascendant Path'. At the near end of this path are the so-called 'potentiates', people who have latent magical ability but lack the discipline to use it in any consistent and meaningful way. At the far end lies the Universal Mind, the great dispassionate, impersonal intellect which suffuses all the world. The Ascendant is the being who traverses this great path, growing in each stage until they achieve a true union with that purest Intellect. Officially, every Sorcerer-King was Ascendant, though any serious discussion with heretics will reveal that this is a point of much contention."

 Z99_week_of_ascension_desc:0 "The Week of Ascension was simultaneously one of the world's most egalitarian institutions and one of its most stratified. Regardless of social class, all non-magical subjects participated in the same festivals and shared in the same activities during the seven-day celebration of virtue.

 Z99_unrestricted_magic_desc:0 "There have been various attempts to regulate and control magical research throughout the history of the mortal realms. Indeed, perhaps one of the truest signs of a healthy state has been its ability to impose at least some basic restrictions on the activities of mages. In the Black Demesne, to suggest such regulations was not merely seen as foolish, but rather a blasphemous heresy against Doctrine itself. Any law which restricted the development of Intellect was opposed to Doctrine, and restrictions on magic were the most heinous of these."

Precisely because the most powerful positions were restricted to magic users, these same powerful people often chose to surround themselves with those who could not possibly be a threat. They often promoted members of the non-magical class based on pure competence, justifying the high placement on the basis of intellectual virtue. This was in stark contrast to many other kingdoms, where promotion was by right of blood alone."

 Z99_the_shadows_flux_desc:0 "Undead are useful on the field of battle as brute soldiers, but they have very limited capacity to think for themselves or listen to verbal orders. Thus, the Demesne had great need for living scouts, battlefield engineers, and officers. Such positions were an excellent way for non-magical subjects to climb the social ladder by making themselves valuable to mages. Every time war was declared, a great influx of some of the Demesne's most intelligent, driven, and ambitious people came to serve the army in all manner of roles, a pattern that would later earn the moniker of 'the Reaper's Gift'."

In the Demesne, it was an expectation and personal obligation for every magical initiate to serve for at least some time in the military. This vastly greater pool of magical manpower allowed the Demesne to turn the entire upper officer corps into the exclusive province of mages, allowing decentralized and responsive magical tactics that were far more impressive than any single sorcerer could achieve alone."

Theoretically, as long as one wore the ring of an Acolyte, one was honorbound to give nothing but absolute loyalty to the legitimate bearer of the Ninth ring in all matters.

Often, positions were given to initiates solely on the basis of personal relationships or alliances, as the Acolytes attempted to strengthen the position of their various assets and pawns. This allowed the Acolytes to command a vast, informal power base among a chosen group of initiates, forging an officer corps that was deeply loyal to the Acolyte personally and which sought to perform to their greatest ability in return for the Acolyte's favor."

Over time, the rituals surrounding the rings and the personal relationship between each Acolyte and the [Z99.Monarch.GetTitle] would take on greater layers of meaning, with their formal interactions becoming a dense maze of metaphor and meaning only decipherable by a select few at the heart of the court."

Before settling, they studied the various texts, learning from the dwarves of old, scattered across the ruins. But with so little records left, their research only led to the decipherment of the dwarven language and a few smithing inventions.\n\nHowever with the abundance of records across all of the sections of Amldihr, it let them study the past of the dwarves and lead to a better understanding of the depths of the now ruined holds, their intricate laws and the advanced weaponry they once possessed.

While deeply unpopular with the Ynnics, the antler horse, which is considered a sacred animal in Ynnic culture, was exempted from the tax.

As times change, however, the Veykodans are now congregating in larger settlements and are establishing new towns and cities.

The school revolves around, primarily, defeating opponents in the most painful way possible. This is made possible by the precise application of pressure to certain key points of an enemy via an open palm strike. Depending on the area of impact, this can have any number of effects - particularly skilled individuals can delay these blows up to eight hours, bringing a man down as he goes to rest after combat!\n\nWhen brought to combat, this is a particular asset to our warrior-monks; the fast and unpredictable nature of combat leaves few capable of reacting, let alone stopping, to a blow that can incapacitate them as quickly as it was struck.

In effect, these taxes were so extortionate that every villager would need to sell everything they owned in order to even hope to pay them off.\n\nIn response, a delegation of villagers made their way to a bandit group, the Society of the Gentle Fist, and promised them power for their salvation.

The reality is that we provide a veritable feast to our soldiers on the evenings before battle, often consuming as much as quadruple the regular stores in a single night.\n\nThough it is helpful to raise the men's spirits, this practice also grants us the appearance of being gluttonous - which, though seemingly harmful, has its own benefits.

Such powers and legend make the monks of Yantrakari respected and feared among the powerful of Haless, for it is a rare day when one marked for death by the Yantrakari escapes alive. After all, where can you run when every shadow might hide a lethal blade?"

 Y48_born_from_nothing_desc:0 "The origins of the Yantrakari are humble and begins with the Jaherian conquests. The coming of Jaher and his Phoenix Legions displaced hundreds of thousands of people across Haless, and many of those that fled the lowlands of Rahen and Bomdan would make their way into the misty hills of Xianjie, where they were given shelter by the monks of Wulin. Some of these refugees began to serve the Wulin directly as a show of gratitude for being given a new home. Put to work on less-than-honorable tasks that the masters did not want to be associated with, the early Yantrakari performed with great enthusiasm and zeal as they began to serve their new home. To this day, the Yantrakari families are bound by a strong sense of unity and loyalty to the concept of the Xia as a whole, an oddity among their normally fractious countrymen."

The Phoenix Empire in Haless was deeply unstable for its entire history, and both Jaher and his son Jaerel would be assassinated by Halessi intent on throwing off the Elven Yoke. It was the Yantrakari who slew Jaerel and broke the Phoenix Empire in Haless forever, one of their greatest agents infiltrating the palace of the Sunrise Emperor and slipping past all of his defenders to strike the killing blow. The prestige of that kill, the final extinguishing of the Phoenix's embers, is to this day the greatest glory of the Yantrakari."

 Y48_hidden_from_the_world_desc:0 "The Yantrakari are well known as a secretive people, distrustful of those outside of their clans and doubly suspicious of non-Xia. Though their loyalty to the Wulin is beyond question, it is rare for more than a token delegation to attend major festivals or gatherings of the Schools, and it is not unusual for the Yantrakari to completely ignore official summons of the Masters. The day-to-day lives of the Yantrakari reveal this secrecy and inward focus to be more than just diplomatic show - folk do not converse as they pass on the street, nor do they hold open markets for the sale of goods or gather publicly for religious worship. Though they are open with those few who prove themselves trustworthy, the Yantrakari's inherent stoicism and reticence to engage with outsiders makes them nearly immune to spies or saboteurs seeking to steal the secrets of the Looming Shadow."

Crafted on looms made of ebonwood, creation of a Shade Cloak involves the weaving of fine silk and threads of shadow together into a product not quite corporeal. Seeming to ever shift as if buffeted by an unseen wind and blending perfectly with its background, those who wear these Shade Cloaks are rendered nearly invisible in dim light. With this tool enhancing their already lethal arsenal of skills, the assassins of Yantrakari are nigh uncatchable when vanishing into the night."

A deeper examination, however, would reveal that Yantrakari towns are anything but ordinary, and running between the various buildings of each community are extensive networks of hidden chambers, false walls, tunnels, and subterranean rooms. These secret living complexes allow individuals to hide themselves away in the presence of intruders, or move swiftly from one side of a town to another for purposes of defending their communities. The great experience that the Yantrakari have developed with labyrinthine building has not only made their homes difficult to conquer, but also made them into experts on creating the most usable space in the smallest area with the least resources."

Among these are a variety called the Qi-Xin, beings of fog that take the form of winged snakes and eat the idle thoughts of daydreamers. The monks of Yantrakari have learned to summon the duplicitous and cunning Qi-Xin, and with pacts and deals have been able to glean great knowledge of the past and present. Some believe that the Yantrakari learned the secrets of Shadow Magic itself from the Qi-Xin - but whatever the truth behind the legend, there is no doubt that the Yantrakari spirit callers are masterful at gathering secrets from across Haless and using them against any targets or enemies of the School of the Looming Shadow."

It protects us from harm, allowing a handful of brave Kuta to protect the rest from harm. It also provides a year-long source of food, providing a plentiful bounty of fish, big and small, for the Kuta to graze upon without concern for harvests or rains. It does this without complaint, and without payment - for most.\n\nWe hold a yearly festival where many fruits and vegetables are thrown into the ocean, a payment in nourishment for all that it does for us, followed by games and festivities where the ocean might watch and be entertained. These do wonders to keep tensions from boiling over, as well."

There were very few places for constructing powerful ships meant for the open seas, and fewer still to maintain them - the resources were simply needed for other affairs. This all changed when a group of Yanshen pirates sailed to our shores, captained by a pirate queen. Following a friendly reception and a few hours of examinations, they offered a deal: they would pay for the construction of port infrastructure, provided they were given preferential treatment.\n\nThe docks that followed were grand and efficient, providing room for even the greatest ships to come to port and rest. Many new techniques were pioneered in the creation of the first Kuta dock, many of which are still used today to great effect."

Marriage along the waterfront is a common sight in Kuta, for it is believed that those who proclaim their union whilst basking upon the shore shall receive the blessings of the sea, guaranteeing a joyful life together. In the event that a couple cannot reach the sea, a small stream offers a suitable substitute.\n\nSuch rituals are often referred to as the Kutan Rites of Matrimony, an age-old tradition that has spread throughout much of the Lupulan. Every year, hundreds of potential pairings make their way to these bountiful shores to be wedded, oftentimes settling down and pursuing a fruitful life in Kuta's tropical clearings and ample rainforests."

Though the tolls are slightly higher than most, the sheer openness of the docks makes up for it. All individuals, provided that they follow Kuta's laws on dry land, are allowed to do as they please upon their ships. There have been cases of pirates saving their own lives by sailing into Kuta, where their presence was not only embraced, but protected by the local forces.\n\nAs a result, ideas tend to flow in and out of Kuta more openly than any other place, for our extraordinary openness makes our port a far more tempting haunt for merchants; though the sea elves come to buy goods, oftentimes they often also sell new information to be investigated and processed."

It is still up to the sailors of Kuta to fight well enough to turn aside any army. As it so happens, they are capable of just that.\n\nKuta sailors are braver than any other on Halann, and fiercer too. Many a raider ship has been defeated after being outmaneuvered by a Kuta ship, who moved in to board and battle when their opponents would least expect it. Many soldiers first distinguish themselves on the ocean, and nearly all leave with their aptitude at sea unharmed."

They were made to transport individuals and to survey the Ringlet Isles, and were designed with exceptional speed in mind - to evade fights, rather than perform them.\n\nEventually, due to sustained naval combat, these djongs found new purpose. The djongs would be tied to larger, heavier ships, then detached as combat was joined. They were able to maneuver around larger ships and, using the exceptional bravery of Kuta sailors, boarded and neutralized enemy ships-of-the-line."

Increased Cannorian presence in Haless resulted in an even greater influx of information and goods, the most notable of which were missionaries. These Ravelian missionaries eventually found their mark and, slowly, converted the populace to Ravelianism. In the year 1788, a single year after efforts began, the nation of Kuta was the first in Haless to officially proclaim its state religion Ravelianism. A period of openness followed after, where the country gradually permitted more and more business opportunities, including the first organized logging companies for the Lupulan Rainforest.\n\nIt was said that Kuta was the main factor in the spread of Ravelianism, for their native missionaries were more capable of adapting the faith to the unique conditions of Haless."

Her reforms refilled the Brenulan coffers, filled the army with men, and replaced the old administration with a system so efficient we use it even today.\n\nHer genius is the reason we are an independent country today - having defeated Arawkelin without even a single arrow fired - and her reforms, visible even today, are doubtlessly why we are still independent from our old overlords today."

Gasps of fear, unreasonable anger, even inhuman hunger; all of these can be removed by ritual or by elixir. As it happens, many of our country's problems are caused by spirits.

The music of Jaya Raya is remarkable for its fast tempo and strong percussion, and the addition of metallic sounds creates a melody that is incredibly popular, not to mention loud.\n\nAny who fight us will hear the echoes of Hebat music, an omnipresent beat that our troops might march, fight, and die to."

Though the arrival of Pinghoi complicated matters, the struggle with foreigners is one that Jaya Raya is very used to.\n\nThough they might seem superior, none know the Lupulan.

It performed the water dance I have heard so much about, and eventually they animated a second, and the two did all sorts of things, all the while their puppeteers (were those really puppets?) narrated their goings-on. It felt almost as if the dolls were waiting for cues.\n\nIt did not look like any kind of necromancy to me, and that unsettles me. These puppets... there is nothing like them, not in the whole world. How do you make a bundle of cloth and sticks move like it's alive? Were it breathing, it would have been like a real thing. Their owners... their hands barely moved.

Having found an abandoned statue under the lake, the chieftain signed a dark covenant; they promised the statue followers in exchange for the freedom of his people. Using this power, Tlagapatung was able to break free of the Jaya Raya yoke. Ever since, the whistling people have enshrined the lake.

For this, the efficient operation of the council is a necessity.\n\nIn exchange for their duties, this council has managed to carve itself out a very needed niche in the government, and the pawangs hold great influence in the government, unlike lesser spirit hunters."

 Y75_pact_of_the_unknown_desc:0 " In the year 1619 AA, Tlagapatung suffered a decade of constant disasters. Floods hit record highs, earthquakes shook the jungle, and hostile spirits swarmed like angry hornets. To say the state had fallen upon hard times was an understatement! In 1627, to round off all these events, the Pinghoi pirates invaded Tlagapatung, seeking to subjugate their inhabitants. Though the soldiers of the whistling people fought bravely, their state was so shaken by disaster that it could not provide them with what they required for victory.\n\nThe king at this time, Kalagamet, led a band of soldiers to Semat Tidakhui, begging it once more to deliver its followers from destruction. What transpired none can say, but 7 days later the king returned with a band of Hantu, powerful spirits with demonic powers. These Hantu routed the Pinghoi pirates easily, emanating negative energy in waves so strong that those they faced often routed outright. How our patron spirit could summon a host of this magnitude is unknown, but by integrating the Hantu into our regular forces we can ensure Tlagapatung never faces destruction again."

All sorts were named, from minor animal spirits that could hardly be seen on a human's finger to the very spirit of the Lupulan, marking it as one of the most complete almanacs on spirits even to the modern day. These books were popularized in the 17th and 18th centuries as adventurers flocking to the region used them as guide-books.\n\nWhat they did not know is that the wizard writing these was a devout follower of Semat Tidakhui. Countless symbols and hymns to the spirit were disguised within the pages, such that any uninformed individual would be instilled with an unhealthy amount of respect for the spirit of Tlagapatung. The consequences of such trickery is not known, but some rumors have attested to a gradual increase in demonic energy at Tlagapatung's sacred shrine."

To simply label them all as malicious or benevolent is a harmful designation, and so our people have had to learn the nature of each spirit they encounter.

In order to resolve this issue, we have had to find new combat uses for copper.

In times of peace, however, we used our extraordinary mobility to settle disputes. Many horsemen were talented negotiators, and even when negotiation failed, our riders were able to force a solution.\n\nThe soldiers of the Baihon Xinh, though plentiful, were not able to fully cover every area of the empire.

The last emperor, known posthumously as the Driven Emperor, overheard his sons plotting to shatter his hard-won empire into squabbling statelets. Though he might have loved his children, the mere idea of this disunity was more than he could handle. Mad with rage, he prepared their deaths - yet found he loved them too much to kill them by his own hands. For this deed, he hired an executioner - his first mistake - to kill them all. He failed, and one of the slayers-of-unity fled north, where he prepared the destruction of Baihon Xinh.\n\nUnderstanding the nature of his failure, the Driven Emperor used a lost Khom ritual and killed himself to live as a specter, seeking to dedicate his very existence to saving the empire he so beloved. Even with a forbidden ritual, his efforts fell upon deaf ears as the hated separatists tore his empire apart. It matters not, now, for the Driven Emperor still wanders Halann, rended from his corporeal form, and his presence fills us with the very same stuff he exists from.\n\nVengeance.

Thanks to some well-placed money and connections, however, a Binhrung army and Sirtani raiders arrived and defended Hon Sai from an immediate invasion from Ma Hoang.\n\nNo debt went unpaid that day.

The Khom people have kept this system rigid, going so far as to formalize it.\n\nAn individual lives and dies according to their familial role.

Though many had the courage to stay when the traitor pretender broke away, this courage turned out to be nothing but a ruse. As the Driven Emperor killed himself as part of his immortalization, many took it as their sign to leave. Countless nobles, big and small, fled to Ma Hoang, throwing their lot in with him.\n\nThose few who remained, whatever the reason, quickly found out that they had made the correct decision.

His sons lie dead, their bones ground to powder and forgotten; his restoration of Baihon Xinh has brought it to peaks never before known. With this done, he left this mortal world as gracefully as he entered it.\n\nBy this point the Driven Emperor was beloved by all Khom people, and countless plays and works of literature based on the stories of his life.

Of course, this came with a benefit - we would protect those who paid us tribute. Few tried, and fewer succeeded in their invasions.\n\nOne came closer than most. The elf Jaher marched upon Haless, seeking to subjugate it to elven rule. Though he nearly succeeded in subjugating Baihon Xinh, 300 defenders held a fortress for over six months, which allowed the rest of the Thidinkai to rally to their defense.

They would offer their services to Baihon Xinh, they explained, in exchange for somewhere to live, work, and study. They were given just that, a district in Cay Cam Sinh.\n\nThough their motivations are unknown, the tools the gnomes introduced were priceless. From a device able to detect the arrival of monsoons to the region to magical telepathic communicators.

This fascination culminated in the Ethereal Makkbom, a large tower which was one of Halcann's earliest formalized observatories.\n\nMany observations of constellations and stars in Haless can be traced to the findings of the observatory, who carefully logged every discovery and pattern.

The sort of ship that could survive the journey across Uelos' Lament was not always the sort that the Company needed, and as its operations grew it soon began building its own. To ensure consistency and a sufficient supply as conflicts against competitors and pirates intensified, in 1633 Director Alfons Silcalas ordered the construction of a set of shipyards in New Calas, and in time the Company's intra-Aelantir sealanes were dominated by fleets of standardised ships built there, known as merchantmen, following patterns drawn up by experts hired from headquarters in Damescrown.\n\nBut not only were these merchantmen used for trade and cargo - they were also armed to protect against pirates or privateers when not sailing in convoy, and though not built to stand against proper warships, they were at times pressed into service to bolster the Company’s navy, and on more than one occasion the additional numbers turned the tide of battle, such as at the Battle of Cape Mordun."

Had the Company remained solely in Cannor, the wars of religion would have divided it, for their noble backers in Arbaran turned Corinite whilst their bourgeois headquarters in Damescrown remained staunchly Adeanic.\n\nBut in their Aelantir operations, such divisions were kept out of the open, for Ara was respected by both the Corinites and Adeanics of the CLSTC, and zealotry had always been ignored regardless in favour of prosperity. Even with the arrival of the Ravelians, religious divisions within the Company remained unimportant, for there was space for Saint Ara of the Ravelian Church in their beliefs too."

Known as dread slavers and merciless marauders, many chose to surrender and accept gnollish oppression rather than fight when Viakkoc's armies approached.\n\nThis experience in domination proved as applicable in newly-conquered Akasik as it was in the south.

Longtime rivals, the armies of the two gnollish packs clashed before the walls of Kheterat for two days before Grizaka's superior magics crushed Viakkoc and his army against the shoulder of the Mother's Sorrow.\n\nThe Clash of the Gnolls at Kheterat was an unmitigated disaster for Viakkoc and led to the disintegration of its wider empire. Viakkoc XI, grandson of the dead king, led his people home in the aftermath of the battle and vowed revenge on Grizaka and all her followers.

Without easy trading partners, Viakkoc's merchants turned to a far more dangerous market - Demons.\nOffering the Corsairs of Viakkoc diabolical knowledge and powerful soldiers in exchange for slaves and souls, the wealth and power of the Seascourge Gnolls grew as they bartered with demonic entities for ever greater power."

Though the practice was limited due to the difficulty of finding and capturing planetouched, it was immensely profitable, and Viakkoc's unique position at the intersection of Sarhal and Cannor gave them a near monopoly on the trade."

For many years, Viakkoc considered the Dove Throne of Anbennar to be the ultimate prize. They dreamed of a Gnollish Kingdom at the heart of Dameria, a Gnollish Emperor on the Dove throne directing a terrible empire, one that would spread the Xhazobkult across the Divenhal and Dameshead. Though they would never achieve this goal, the Corsair Fleet made four great raids on Damesear between 1543 and 1631 in an attempt to gain a beachhead for this new Empire of Viakkoc, burning the forests of Varivar and seizing many treasures from the temples of the Moonmount in the process. The final raid of 1631 would prove disastrous for the Corsair Kingdom, with Viakkoca XII being slain by cannonfire before she even made landfall. Having no direct heir, the kingdom soon disintegrated into patchwork territories controlled by petty warlords vying for dominance, allowing Cannorian powers to seize much of the coastline."

The Gremrabo would see two opposing gnolls invent increasingly outlandish insults about their opponent in front of an audience, the first gnoll unable to respond to an insult being declared the loser.

Putting the tribesmen to work clearing vines and shrubbery, Harimar found the beautifully sculpted walls of a High Temple. Unlike any Temple Complex he’d seen before, the walls carried a deep green color, which would lead Khom to give it the name Xan Vaung in the future. Leaving behind a garrison to study it, he left with his host and never returned, but their descendants would enlighten Khom settlers to the High Philosophy and remain there to this day.\n\nToday, the emerald spires of Xan Vaung stand tall above Ma Hoang as a reminder to all the greatness of the High Gods, and that same authority extends to us as their custodian."

It gives a stark example of the unreasonable expectations and abuses that go unnoticed and unpunished due to our cultural and legal expectations of duty to family. As the patriarch of the Caoban family, Sang saw his word as law regarding his sons, expecting them to perform whatever he demanded of them exactly as he demanded it. He would work his sons like animals, berating them all the while. So, when he came to find out that they had gone against his wishes and planned to partition the empire after his death, he felt (and maybe was) justified to order their execution.\n\nWe will reform these laws and customs.

The monks argued well that a particular mural held a far more martial connotation than previously believed. The philosophers took this revelation to heart, believing that the methods of chi cultivation the monks practiced gave new insight into the High Gods, and begged to be taught how to perform it. The monks relented, and a new tradition was born.\n\nThis new class came to be known as the Righteous Philosophers, adherents of the High Philosophy but trained in the Righteous Path.

Even after losing its empire, the spirit raged on, tormenting the people of Tuan Caoban in their dreams and sending familiars to abduct innocents from the streets for use in nefarious rituals. It took the efforts of the new emperor and a host of spirit hunters to finally put an end to it.\n\nChanged by the events he experienced within that palace, the emperor worked with what lucky few survived the ordeal to establish the Order of Banishment, a governmental body that would train and deploy spirit hunters to put down any spirit that threatened the status quo.

One particular fruit of this union was the steady migration and integration of gnomish intelligentsia into Kheteratan high society, especially in the entrepôt of Koroshesh where gnomish traders had already been settling for over a century. The untimely collapse of the Hierarchy would see their numbers bolstered even further by waves of gnomish upper class refugees who flocked to the shelter provided by their close ally. As a whole, these Delta Gnomes who once comprised the upper echelon of classical gnomish society still maintain many of the traditions and customs of the Old Hierarchy that have otherwise been forgotten by their Cannorian brethren.

Her crowning achievement, however, would only be fully realized centuries after her death - by measuring the angle of the sun's rays during her expeditions to chart the geography of Kheterata, she successfully extrapolated the circumference and size of the planet in a time when global travel was not even imagined as a possibility.\n\nTragically, her works would see undue censure during the period of Jexisian influence on Kheterata due to their apparent contradiction of a multi-generational elven exodus.

The city of Koroshesh sits upon the delta from which the Sorrow pours, and in that city lay the great Sorrow's End Harbor, where countless vessels from across Halann have begun and ended their voyages since the days of ancient antiquity.

Its most important feature, however, is also its most unassuming - a large number of apartments that sit at the complex's heart, initially constructed by Menkaunswt the Warrior-King in order to host the various gnomish lapidarists and tinkerers who he saw as instrumental to his ambitions.

The marshy floodplains that surround the river's delta feel this great love the fiercest, yet Koroshesh has endured and even continued to expand and grow into the moist swampland. The key to this success lay in the ingenuity of the Delta Gnomes, who have cultivated their namesake with precision and care, constructing levees and dams throughout the delta. Dried drainage canals line the city, stretchmarks that serve as testament to the countless acres reclaimed from the wetlands and repurposed for urban development.

The ascension of Khetarch Amsiskhet III, however, saw a resurgence in the influence of the Delta Gnomes when he elected to fill his court with gnomish advisors, directing them in particular down the burgeoning field of artificery.\n\nThe magnum opus of this brief period of artifice in Kheterata would no doubt be the Mechamel - an ingenious if somewhat uncanny automaton that could only charitably be said to resemble a camel. Ambling about on dexterous, extendable legs of metal and comfortably capable of seating two, the Mechamel promised to revolutionize the otherwise labor intensive lives of the Kheteratan peasant.

These faceted gems with 56 cuts would become a trademark of the Delta Gnomes, yet to produce a gemstone of such obscene refinement was a painstakingly slow process that required a lapidarist with a lifetime's experience. Consequently, these powerful weapons soon became an artifact of classical antiquity wielded only by arcanists of both extreme skill and wealth.\n\nWith the advent of artificery, however, the degree of scientific precision that a Gnomish Cut gemstone could provide led to an explosion in their demand. Fortunately, due to numerous advancements in lapidary technology over the intervening centuries, the Delta Gnomes were at last more than able to meet the renewed demand for their legendary cut."

What drew both of these groups and more to settling in the region is both the reason for the River's distinctive color and it's main utility: Sulfur. As a result of the volcanic activity of Mount Havoral in the Day of Ashen Skies, Varainé became home to all sorts of volcanic chemicals - mostly sulfides - that besides giving the river its faint green-yellow coloring, also serves as the basis of several important Varainéy industries, such as the production of Fertilizers, Glassware, Gunpowder, Pharmaceuticals, Beauty products, and Alchemicals."

It is located by the frontier beyond the traditional boundary of the Ynnic realms, where many trappers and hunters range to hunt, trap, and fish. They then bring these products to market in Gomosengha which, bolstered by its own local abundance of wildlife, has led to a thriving regional fur industry. Nowhere is this great demand seen more than in the muskrat, ermine, and beaver pelts that bombard the markets every year."

A family of Old Rzentur gave the elf hospitality for a night, and he returned the favour by teaching them how to tame moose. The next day, the elf tried to leave on his journey, but the family insisted the elf of the mountain stay for another night. And so the elf of the mountain reciprocated this favour by teaching them how to make cheese from moose milk.\n\nThe third day, the elf departed, but just as he was about to vanish on the edge of the horizon, he turned back and spoke to the family: “Fools! Had you insisted I stay for another day, I would have taught you how to make candles from the whey.""

Whilst the Cannorians are of a multitude of different races, the beings known as kobolds, which we dubbed 'Varlusgie' for the green scales of the first to arrive, are a strange, almost distorted mirror to the Drozma Tur. Small, wingless and almost like humanoid dragons, they claim to be related to - or even created by - dragons. They first began to arrive in the lands of the Rzentur en masse after hearing of Varlengeilt, the one true god. They venerated the idea of dragons as gods in Cannor, but none were to be found, until their arrival in Aelantir.\n\nExcellent excavators and with a predisposition for finding wealth, many of these kobolds devote themselves to Varlengeilt and gladly adopt the true faith. They display piety through labor and the excavation of the riches of the mountains and they hope to one day personally place these treasures at his feet and add them to his great hoard."

Instead they are a large breed of canine which has risen to prominence in recent years due to its thick, fluffy coat being well suited to the cold climes of the Northern Ynn and the Broken Sea.\n\nExtremely protective of their owners and those who earn their trust, drakehounds have been known to brutally savage any they think are harming their charges.

For nearly a century it showed no signs of life, and the faithful fell to despair as rulers fought each other for Drozmagog's hoard. Except for a few. A devoted group of veterans, returning from the War of the Great Dragon Host, founded the Order of Dolenmach which pursued the mission to safeguard Drozmagog's egg from any Ynnic incursion, hiding it for its safety among the foothills of the Ekyunimoy Mountains.\n\nThen, in the spring of 1443, the egg showed signs of life, eliciting great joy, but also eliciting great caution. The members of Dolenmach were priests and forward-thinkers, who realized that many would try to persuade the young hatchling and influence them negatively, or worse, try to subvert the Son of God to their own ends. And so the news were kept secret for a year, until the joy and commotion for His Divinity's hatching became too much to hide.\n\nAfterwards, Dolenmach kept fighting to ensure that Drozmagog's spawn was raised by morally upright guardians in a philosophically and culturally rich environment, overseeing the creation of the Ustajanky ik Drozma, or the Mouths of the Dragon, tasked with ensuring the Son of God would be capable of not only leading the faith but also of uniting it towards a new future."

The swamps and fens of Mocvare are shallow and filled with muck and rivergrass, making normal paddles ineffective. This resulted in the development of crude hand powered paddle boats.\n\nThis gnome, whose name was incomprehensible to our scholars, with local assistance, replaced the hand-crank with a chain powered by foot pedals, and attempted to “test” the device against the current of one of the Ynn's canals. Unfortunately, this is when we learned that gnomes are physically frail, and a “light current” to us, for them is apparently enough to pull them into the sluices that maintain the waterflow. Thankfully, since they expected to return, their notes were left on shore, and the advancements had some merit and left hands free to fish or, as has grown even more common, allowed people to leisurely travel along the River’s waters - so long as they keep away from the deeper parts!"

My hopes were dashed when I saw the local inhabitants: they looked at me like I was from another world, and ignored me when I pleaded for shelter.

Only the local priest, a Ruinborn named Vardha, was kind enough to offer me a loaf of bread and some shelter.

The Rzentur had been pushing into the Ynn for decades, striking against its faithful in an effort to spread the dominion of their dragon god. Mocvare was targeted due to three reasons. The first was simple practicality. Any further expansion into Dolindhan realms was blocked by Mocvare, whose knights were more accustomed to fighting in the treacherous swampland and would have been a consistent thorn in the side for any circumventing force. The second was logistics: the Great Dam was a large crossing that allowed armies to move easily to the north or south bank of the mighty Ynn. Finally, there was faith: Mocvare's Great Dam was an important holy site to the Ynnic faithful and paramount to their morale.\n\nWhat followed was a brutal 15 year long siege, where the Rzentur would be forced to split their sieging force into three groups to encircle the north and south ends of the dam while also besieging Mocvare's city. The next 7 years would be marked with fierce Mocvarian resistance, with bands of faithful Ynnics from other realms fighting along the southern bank, breaking the siege no less than 13 different times. A two year armistice followed, which was broken when the Rzentur once again marshalled a great force to encircle the city. This time, however, the siege was backed with weapons inspired by Cannorians, primarily in the form of gunpowder explosives which were deployed to break the dam's formidable defences. In spite of this, it would only be in 1610 AA when the Rzentur’s fire ended the reign of the water of the Ynn, with the final capitulation of the city. Whether an act of mockery, or of honour, the 381 remaining defenders were allowed to board a funeral barge and be sent down the Ynn."

Fearing the worst, Lord Dalatan I faced the oncoming horsemen with the too-few militiamen at his command. Thankfully, conflict did not break out that day, as instead - to the Selocshan surprise - the Buycev tribal leader Auvuro called for parley.\n\nUpon their meeting, Auvuro guaranteed to the Lord that he had no intent to slay the defenders - though both knew he could. Instead, the Epednar were here to talk business: his tribe wanted in on the spoils of the Ynnic wars, and wanted the Selocshan to advertise and legitimise their ‘services’. In exchange, he offered protection from other tribes of Epednar - or from Dalatan’s fellow Ynnics - a protection the township evidently could use.\n\nThus, Auvuro’s tribe were granted governance over all the lands west of Selocshana Fort. More than a century later, the Selocshan still look at the tent-city of the ‘Auvukonyr’ with distrust - though most admit; playing host to the greatest horsemen this side of the Ynn does have its upsides."

Better instead to sample Selocshan hospitality on the way to Adbrabohvi - so long as we convince them of that, we can enjoy first pickings of the Cannorian product.

He would often be seen half-sunk in the river, begging it to cease its punishment of his innocent people. In 1568 the Lord’s son, emulating his father, knelt in the current, praying for the flood’s end and struggling not to be swept away. He failed at both, and only by happenstance did the River’s Hands find him, unconscious and ill by the riverbank.\n\nThe disciples of Begga extended Her charity to the child, attempting to nurse him to health - until eventually, the Lord’s search led him to the roaming priests. Seeing what the Ynn had done to his beloved son, Lord Talvynn fell into a crisis of faith. He begged the River’s Hands for aid; they told him only prayer could save his child’s life. So pray Talvynn did - not to the Ynn, but to a foreign God - and a week later, his son miraculously awoke.\n\nPraising Begga, Talvynn became the first - and, for a long time, the only - Ynnic lord to convert to the Regent Court, breaking his oath to the River Priests of Adbrabohvi and further isolating his lordship from the disapproving Sarda. Though the other Ynnic realms denounced his conversion, many Selocshan had seen the good the River’s Hands had done, and tolerance of both Ynn Worship and the growing minority devoted to the Cannorian Pantheon became the norm within Selocshana."

That illusion was shattered during the Red Year, 1787, when Sarda found itself beset on all sides by enemies. The fortress of Selocshana saw itself facing a Cannorised army for the first time - and the modern Plumsteader forces were unlike any besiegers that had preceded them. The defection of the Auvukonyr at the promise of full integration into Plumsteader society and the subsequent surrender of the fortress marked the end of a near-millenium of home rule for the Selocshan, and saw the citizenry of that township become increasingly suspicious of any foreign influence.”\n\n-The New Sarda, Privinc Ostravyr, Sarda Demographer, 1844"

Once after such loss, she wandered far into the Rzenta forest, and arrived at a hidden glade, where a fey was waiting for her. The fey knew of her troubles and promised help, giving her a potion she claimed would make the one who drank it incapable of using magic. With a heart full of jealousy and a wounded pride from her recent defeat, the older sister accepted the gift and hurried back home. \n\nAfter dinner, the younger sister tried starting a fire with magic, but could not. As she continued trying to cast a spell, she became more and more anxious. The older sister smiled, her cursed deed being successful. In the meantime, her sister began to change as feathers began growing on her skin, her eyes turned black and her voice grew more beastlike. With her desperation at the fullest, the younger sister turned into an owlbeast. Shocked, the older sister watched in stupor as the beast lunged at her. \n\nNext day, the family's neighbours came to visit but were met with a ghastly scene.

Upon seeing the neighbours, she screamed at them to get away from her and fled outside, going into the same forest her sister went to the day before. \n\nYears later, the locals would sometimes claim to have seen a feathered lady wandering the forest, her transformation seemingly becoming more permanent with time.

Its parent city, Lokemeion, payed little attention to it, until the philosophers found a good use for the settlement. A growing movement in Lokemeion, led by the radical philosopher Varamelas Dranikes, called for true democracy, direct elections, guarenteed rights for all, and reforms the ruling class of Lokemeion found objectionable. These "Dranikites" where causing chaos and division within the city, and in a desperate bid to retain power and avoid internal conflict, Lokemeion exiled these radical philosophers and their followers, with the kylakas at the time, Eledas Akropolites stating "They can build their so called paradise, but not here. In Besolakí they will go." The exiling of the Dranikites started a long standing trend in Lokemeion, where those that disagreed with the established order would be sent to Besolakí, which resulted in a population boom. These exiles and their descendants led to Besolakí being far more willing to embrace new ideas than the other Kheionai."

This was also true in Besolakí until a fateful summer in 1590.\n\n While discussing trade deals with the representatives of the distant island of Eborthíl, kylakas Gelondikos and his entourage were ambushed by barbarians from the forests and dragged deep inland close to a massive lake. The Cannorians, who so recently had been clashing with him on a daily basis, were among the first to propose an expedition to save them, bringing along a number of mercenaries they had awaiting by the docks. Slaughter. That is the only word that could describe the result of the Cannorian incursion, the barbarians who did not expect to fight at such a long range were utterly and completely crushed, so much so that the lake by which they stood was named Mteídhan - the lake of Death. Soon after, Gelondikos became one of the first among the kheionai to begin hiring Cannorian advisors and adding musketeers to his armies, to a devastating effect."

Once the plutocrats of Ormam saw that the settlement survived, more settlers and supplies were sent. While the area around Apikhoxí was a prime location for a city, it was even better suited to agriculture, which the Ormam state saw as an opportunity, a cheap and permanent end to their food supply issues. The open door policy was put in place, where anyone that wanted to could enter Apikhoxí, grab a small plot of farmland for themselves, and as long as they protected it and stayed on it for 5 years, it would be theirs. As a consequence, many immigrants from across the Kheionai world, almost always of the lower classes, came to Apikhoxí hoping to build a better life for themselves. Most elves in Apikhoxí descended from other cities, and so the Apikhoxí state cares little for where its citizen's origins may be."

Defeated in battle, they were sent to the edges of the known world, founding a settlement on the far side of The Devand. While they were forced to work the fields, far from their friends and familly, their morale never wavered. Joined by constant shipments of convict laborers, Deyeion would become known as the prison colony. Deyeion’s early history was marked by constant revolts only being barely put down, with Degakheion often having to intervene directly. Eventually, after several generations, the descendants of rebels and criminals would wrestle control of the local government, reaching a compromise with Degakheion, recognizing their parent city as overlord while gaining much autonomy in return.

While most Kheionai saw tea as a mere delicacy, it quickly gained popularity in Deyeion. Soon, much of the population would fall in love with it, and even the state’s attempts at growing tea at home could not satisfy the demand. The Deyeion state instituted a tariff on imported tea, in order to profit off the tea trade and to encourage the population and the local oligarchs to use homegrown tea instead."

Many a barbarian tribe would be defeated in battle, forced out of an area, and settlers would be sent to the area to secure it. This strategy worked well when dealing with the fractured and disunited Basobhar, but once Deyeion pushed deeper inland, it faced problems. An independent group of settlers headed deeper inland than the state had advised, near the land now known as Vexydhan, they were slaughtered. It was not a Basobhar tribe that had committed this atrocious act, but a mysterious group not well known to the Kheionai, the Mteibhar.\n\nUnlike the Basobhar, the Mteibhar were much more unified, and unlike the Basobhar, they could not be easily destroyed. The Mteibhar, seeing the Vexydhan settlers as a declaration of war by Deyeion, began agressively raiding and destroying any Deyeion settlements they could find, with one warband even reaching the walls of the city of Deyeion itself before being turned away. The deyeioni army, in turn, began an agressive campaign of burning every Mteibhara village they could find, and innovated new ways to counter the hit and run tactics the Mteibhara used. Eventually Deyeion, with the help of their allies, would push the Mteibhara back into their home valley, but the legacy of this attritional conflict remains in the new tactics and innovations Deyeion developed."

The league led to lasting peace and the three member states would slowly merge institutions. A shared trade policy, a common military, defined borders, and much more, the Échate league showed the Kheionai banding together would lead to prosperity for its members. When the great kheions of Alecand united in a great league of their own, it was apparent to many that the Échate League was what inspired them to do so. The league would last well into the 1800s, even after the collapse of Ameion’s empire, showing how stable the league truly was."

After the rebuilding, the fire briefly faded into memory until a particularly idiotic Tellumite crier decided to use a pun and refer to it as the Kindlebury Incident. That horrible decision made the fire stick in people's minds throughout the Empire and caused the Emperor and the Grand Duke of Wex to take turns hitting their own foreheads with a thick book. More importantly, it set off a rash of folk-songs and both sober and inane speculation about why it burned.\n\nWas it malicious outside forces? Typically witless adventurers? Careless mages? Was it a bar brawl between Wexonards or the Lorentish or some other foreigners? Did someone light a match next to some flour, or did a cow knock over a lantern? We'll never know, but speculating is too fun to pass up; besides, the ideas we come up with might turn out to be useful for something else."

No matter where the people of Indalaberi originally came from, local or otherwise, they are all rude and stubborn. They have to be pestered even to move a crate from one end of the store to another to help their own mothers. Foreigners do not, in my experience, feel too out of place or unwelcome here simply because these Indalaberi people treat their own parents just as rudely."\n\n- From the writings of Nandaprabhan Janavarman, later Mayor of Bhuvauri, during his Anbennaric journey in the early 14th century."

It has been attempted to whip this behavior out of them, but the screams were only incorporated into the songs.

Stricken by grief, her pack retreated across the mountains to try and save their leader, along with the spoils of the pillaged kingdom.

Although weapons may be prohibited from being drawn upon the grounds, this has not stopped them from dutifully carrying their sheathed blades about the monastery. In practice they use wooden swords, striking hundreds, if not thousands of times a day. Even some, claiming to be remnants of Jaher’s eastern campaign, demonstrate prowess with merely their fists.

And Xogariel,  the greatest savior, the oldest savior, the last savior, looked upon the Mayte and lent the help he could.\n\nIn the end, the Mayte bureaucracy was streamlined, its traditions upheld, its military strengthened.

Even more dangerous are dissidents to both ours and our neighbors' rule, plotting to cast down the walls of our castles from inside, oblivious that doing so would only invite destruction in a scale never seen before.\n\nAnd so, like the underwater lynx that flies from our banners, we must take refuge in our impenetrable domain, but we must also bring the storm of destruction to any enemy who may roam the land. Uncounted amounts of threats that could have shattered the Empire, and the petty lordships that have emerged out of its carcass, have been cut down by dashing Buykonyr clad in orange, or struck by hundreds of arrows from forest rangers with near-legendary aim."

At first, we expected them to just be another threat for us to face eventually. But then their envoys came to our gates, and offered us their knowledge and goods in exchange for ours. And with this, our silence, which had lasted for hundreds of years, was shattered.\n\nSince we were the easternmost Sarda settlement on the Veykodan tributaries of the Ynn we became the main entry point for Cannorian goods, and merchants, Cannorian and Ynnic alike flocked to our lands, turning little isolated villages into prosperous towns and clearing out thousand-year old forests to make space for new settlements"

They also believe that one day, a heir of Rhovynuc will ride from Veykoda at the head of a great host of dashing rogues, and with that host he will shatter the nobility and bring liberty to all Ynnics.\n\nThe only reason why the Buykonyr were never punished for this belief is that such a story coming true was, in the eyes of nearly every Ynnic, simply impossible. But then King Jahanon of New Havoral did descend from the mountains at the head of an army of bandits, and thousands of rangers and hussars flocked to join his host, believing that despite being a human, Jahanon is Rhovynuc's heir.\n\nDue to the influence of the Buykonyr, who by this point owned Arvezl in all but name, we peacefully submitted to Jahanon, who renamed the place New Havorton and chose it as his capital, which Arvezl's riders boast about at every possible opportunity, even though Jahanon's kingdom eventually fell."

Most famous of these is Castle Twin Spears, a Balgabaric-style keep which was meant to be Jahanon's seat of power and occupies nearly the entirety of Old Arvezl, and the Arvezl Academy of Economics and Trade, one of the first universities in the Ynn, built in the shape of a traditional Ynnic temple."

Midway through the process a slave was tied to the burial site and left to starve, their suffering giving rise to a necromantic energy which suffused the mummified gnoll, allowing it to be possessed by a dark spirit. From this ritual a witherling was born, ready to be bound to a warlock’s will through fell magic.\n\nWitherlings made for ideal foot soldiers, for as undead they were ignored by demoncollar hyenas and were capable of receiving the brunt of any attack without complaint, and as former gnolls they retained a savagery and strength of their own.

His skills saw him climb the ranks of the Viakkoc pack and earn command of their western provinces when they marched to war with Kheterata and Gnollakaz in 1441. As soon as they were engaged with the enemy, he betrayed his masters and arranged the murders of any Seascourge commanders still in the area.

Rumours of the vast quantities of genie relics being 'discovered' in Fangaula spread throughout Sarhal, even reaching Cannor and Bulwar, and soon many foreign merchants were arriving in the bazaars of Tzilekal to purchase relics.

The gnolls often used human Fangaulan middlemen to conduct business with the understandably wary Cannorians.\n\nZitan Tomon hosted a rich stock of Sarhaly goods and a convenient location as the first major port beyond the hostile Sandspite.

The expedition never returned, the volcano erupting shortly after they entered the caves below.\n\nThe resulting eruption and mass devastation across Fangaula and beyond would lead to the collapse of the Tzilekal Sultanate and the subsequent colonial period under Busilar.

While most went on to the vast households of gnollish nobles, educated slaves or those that showed a talent for numbers were often sent to the House of Golden Chains.\n\nThe House of Golden Chains was an empire-wide organisation of slaves belonging to the Emperor who were employed solely to administer the vast territories of the empire.

This close contact over the centuries with the gnolls led to a degree of cultural exchange, with the Echenka taking a liberal approach to concepts of gender and synthesising many gnollish beliefs and legends into their own faiths.

 F55_beast_slayer_desc:0 "Maxota “Gifter of Chains” rose to power in what would become Kogzalla in the early 1400s, uniting a horde of gnolls and finally conquering the Akalate of Dasmazar after decades of skirmishes in 1432. In the lands of the Fieldstalker Gnolls where the Twin Xhaz arose many centuries before, identical twins were seen as fated to a great destiny, and thus when Maxota spawned twin daughters of her own she decreed that upon her death her territories would be divided equally in an attempt to avoid the usual messy bloodshed of gnollish succession.\n\nThe conquered civilised eastern lands were given to Khazet, while Maxota’s rugged homeland to the west was granted to the bold and belligerent Zykari. She proved her mettle by leading the defence against an invasion from the neighbouring Rakkaz pack, using her famed skills as a hunter to outwit and defeat the packs of demonically possessed hyena’s unleashed on their lands."

Her descendents would follow this tradition and decades later Kogzallan hunters could be found on expeditions throughout Sarhal and beyond tracking exotic beasts across the borders of many kingdoms. As such they became adept at opening up negotiations to secure safe passage, regaling the courts of even the most xenophobic human rulers with tales of their daring hunts. Or where diplomacy failed, ensuring that their erstwhile hosts had no idea they were there in the first place."

Most gnolls were happy to eat raw meat, whether fresh or not, but the Kogzallans had a more discerning palette and developed a distinctive spicy cuisine that became famous and sought after throughout the gnollish world and beyond."

 F55_tooth_and_claw_desc:0 "The gladiatorial traditions of the Fieldstalkers found a particularly extreme expression in Kogzalla where warriors and hunters would pit themselves against wild animals using only their fangs and claws. This developed into a style of vicious unarmed combat that Kogzallan warriors would employ as a shock tactic. Well into the gunpowder era regiments of Kogzallan troops would stalk into their enemies camps at night and silently set about their hapless foes with tooth and claw."

 F55_cult_of_the_packmother_desc:0 "First the defeat of the would-be Xhazobain Zokka, and then years of raids at the hands of Rakkazi warlocks left the Kogzallans with a distrust for all things demonic, drawn instead to the primal energy of nature and the glory of the hunt. It was in this fertile soil of the Xhazobkults weakness that Kvangahga missionaries from Haraagtseda were able to plant a seed of doubt, challenging and discrediting Xhazobkult shamans in great public displays. By emphasising the goddess Kvanga’s role as The Packmother, the great hunter of demons and the guardian of the natural cycle of life, decay and rebirth, these missionaries were able to sway the powerful clans of Kogzalla and secure a new sister in the faith for their masters to the east."

When the Kogzallans made ventures into shedding their monstrous reputation like their Haraagtsedi kin, it was led by the great stories of the Ezfarags who found themselves welcome on the streets and in the theatres of many of the trading cities of the Gulf of Rahen."

 F55_safeguard_the_wild_places_desc:0 "The love of the hunt in Kogzallan culture led to the establishment of huge game reserves, areas of wilderness where farming and industry were forbidden and the gnolls could indulge their predatory instincts.

This lightning raid ensured that the majority of their newly acquired subjects were prevented from fleeing to the island of Dasmatus with their government in exile, as well as providing the gnolls of what would become Koggraffa with a powerful fleet to transport slaves to the flesh-markets of Rahen without having to rely on human middle men likely to try and take a hefty cut of the profits."

As the ports of Rahen were a major destination for Koggraffan merchants selling their slaves, this constant contact led to a trend in Koggraffan high society for Raheni luxury goods. Wealthy gnollish merchants would decorate themselves in ostentatious displays of jewelry and clothing from the east, with some even superficially adopting the High Philosophy to appear more fashionable than their rivals."

They each had their own unique culture, distinct from the great Kheions out west. Eventually, they grew to be very different, forging their own identities.

To us it seemed impossible that any large towns or cities would exist here without major effort from both the Kheions and their settlers. Unfortunately, the Alecandi refused to provide much if any support besides basic necessities. It was up to the newly arrived settlers to bear the weight of building the colonies.\n\nWithin a short timespan, all of that had changed. What was once the largest forest witnessed by the Kheionai had turned into lush fields, farmlands, and even large towns and bustling communities. They had even found growth in their economy through the slave trade of the Bashobhar.

Even with the threat of the Bashobhar diminishing, there are still predators and monsters that would love to eat an elf for lunch. Thus, the special training of how one should approach the highlands and its dangers is of the utmost importance.

They were by no means professional, but they showed their bravery and prowess in battle. They were treated as honorable elves by the citizens of the Nékheis, serving their country of their own volition. It was not uncommon for the most experienced of the Phylakíor to be given the honor of being incorporated into the army as fully fledged military personnel.\n\nMany Phylakíor groups continue to operate as local police in remote areas, serving when the army cannot.

To keep the shambling horrors at bay and prevent our very destruction, the Sisters must have power, must feed from discord and suffering. In return, it is the duty of the Nail King to keep their terrible hunger at bay. \n\nIn his dual duties, to unite the people and make war against the ignorant, the Nail King is forever a moment from disfavour.

With this parable, Granny Ilfa has taught us that there is power in terror. A man tied in Flying Squirrel pose feels the slow, terrible ache of his joints dislocating. He is a mighty warrior, once the pride of his village; he will not die for very many hours. A while along the road, another is trussed in an identical way - each can catch the moans of the other at the very edge of hearing. \n\nThis slick red chain stains the earth as it goes, marking the route to our territory like a stream to the mouth of a river. It strengthens us, and gives our Wise Three succour enough to work their great magics. Not only torture can achieve our ends in this. Corrupt a well, and the clever can feed on that anguish for the months it takes for disease to claim the people. Prune a little off the top, the vast human herd of the Mengi, and they will return, intent on vengeance, only  to fall once more into the Water Spider's snare.

Coating ceremonial stone daggers with this mixture, we make a hundred cuts, tearing open our flesh to create huge woundworks, the excruciating poison stymying our natural regeneration and fixing the work in place.

Though the foolish troll is an open well, those of wisdom know to wind the truth in coils of technicalities, half-truths, and digressions. Thus, despite our word always being true, few can see through the clever troll’s well-sown undergrowth to garner any of this truth for themselves.

It is the source of all entropy in our world and the other, and it is both Death and Destruction; mourned death, but also the necessary death of nature. \n\nAn easy thing to say, and an impossible thing for a conscious being to accept. To die without protection is a terrible thing. Leave this life naked of tattoos or the proper rites and one forfeits one's soul to the Matriarch, to be wrung out and reincarnated as a Shambling Mound, an unthinking behemoth of the swamp. These beings have terrorised us for generations beyond count, and their fate will not be ours.\n\nThrough the beneficence and goodwill of our patronesses, the Clever Three, our powers over the Matriarch have grown. They have taught us to take a little of its essence and cleverly turn it against our doom. With each driving of a sacred nail into the flesh of the tree, we divert its rage.

Through purposes both martial and civil, weaving has become an integral part of the culture and lifestyle. One month, a weaver may craft beautiful, luxurious hammocks bound for sale across all eastern Sarhal  - while in the next, a troll incursion would necessitate crafting crude yet sturdy nets for the fighting men.

Pitched battles against invading trolls, skirmishes against Tanizu shapeshifters, or, as is often the case, wars against more well-organised Mengi kingdoms - they are no strangers to hardship and loss. Yet, despite this, a feeling of hope and even pride permeates the soldiery. For if the Sitewosi can withstand even the harshest of punishments and survive, then surely they could weather them all and eventually claim superiority. It is for this reason that before going into battle, Sitewosi warriors repeat the old mantra: “In Defeat, Glory Found” to assure them that even if death and defeat find them, they in turn shall find glory and gladly embrace their final rest, knowing their people will endure."

In order to discourage being chosen as targets and protect themselves against such monsters, the Sitewosi adopted a crass yet effective form of psychological warfare, dubbed the “Trolltree Wards”. A troll, preferably alive, is brought to a thick, sturdy tree whereupon it is hoisted by the tree’s branches and then left to slowly bleed out on the trunk by whatever means is most expedient - often a special “troll-stake” pierced through the abdomen and wedged into the tree trunk."

In times of peace, however, Sitewosi “Eryama Baanesa” or “Beast Envoy” are sent to reside within Tanizu lands to serve roles incorporating elements of merchant and diplomat.

Oddly, the ebony inherits the flexibility and relative ease-of-harvest of wood, but also an optimal hardness and sturdiness for armour and especially weapon-crafting. Often described as a “wooden metal”, the Sitewosi long ago discovered the painstakingly arduous process of working such a wondrous material. It has ever since brought them great wealth from professional adventurers, collectors, and trusted allies seeking to possess the fabled “ebony axes of the southern Mengi”. It is half-joked among the Sitewosi that the trolls of Yezel Mora never feel fear, but ebony-clad warriors wielding razor-sharp, ebony axes fit to slice through limbs like air afford them a close second."
 sitewosi_rule_of_the_accorded_kings:0 "Rule of the Accorded Kings"
 sitewosi_rule_of_the_accorded_kings_desc:0 "The reigns of petty Sitewosi kings that have split the people against each other have always coincided with great suffering from invading trolls and neighbouring tribes seeking an opportunistic chance to claim a quick prize or even conquer the Sitewosi. In such situations, when all the kings are threatened, accords of unification are agreed upon. The weaker kings submit willfully to the strongest and wealthiest king and offer their armies and wealth under the promise of ridding the lands of invaders and the return of what remained of said armies and wealth. In reality, however, once an invasion was repelled, the “Accorded King” would never surrender their power. This cycle of imminent danger, unification, and consolidation of power, only to break apart upon death of the king is seen by many philosophical Sitewosi less as a dreaded cycle of tyranny and more of an evolution of state - each ‘cycle’ improving upon the last to eventually result in a perfect, unified kingdom that will endure and prosper for all time."

 ofehibi_the_roundhead_nobility_desc:0 "In what perhaps may seem odd to travellers visiting the lands of the Ofehibi, and Gebahiri in particular, is the custom of wearing the turban. The merchant-nobles of the land had adopted this tradition from their ancestors centuries past after the great exodus of the Raheni to Gebahiri. As well, it is believed by the Ofehibi that the act of simply wearing the turban assists to ingratiate oneself to the native Raheni merchants they often deal with.\n\nA favourite, if morbid, folktale among the Ofehibi is that of the gnoll who was a young and eager slaver with a mind set to make a fortune. After his first successful slave raid, the gnoll ordered his caravan’s navigator to plot a route to the Ofehibi and upon arrival was furious at the sight of the “roundheads”, who he mistook as Raheni. The gnoll slaver, blind with rage and assuming that he was now in Rahen, promptly strangled the navigator to death - whereupon he was informed of the local custom."

Upon being enslaved, the slave awakens to a new, holy purpose - cleansed of any past sins and reborn in the eyes of Amilak to serve dutifully. As for the slaver, his duty to feed, shelter, and perpetuate the enslavement of the wayward is equally cherished. However, because the Mengi people are accepted as sacred by birth, it is viewed reprehensibly for a Mengi to ever enslave or hold another Mengi in bondage. For this reason, any slave found in the Mengi will inevitably be a foreigner."

As time wore on, the tales of such myth evolved into an opportunity for local subjects to confer with their kings, who traveled much like Ardimya-That-Was across their domains and beyond. Soon, merchants seized the opportunity to use the moving royal court to hawk their wares, and eventually it became an official part of the these 'Market Proessions' - where a king travels not only to hold court or engage in diplomacy, but to use such an occassions to share (and sell) the best their kingdom can offer."

Unfortunately, some lords, not realising the duties they possess, tend to treat their slaves... sub-optimally.\n\nBut that does not mean that a slave can just give up their duty just because it is difficult. If a slave proves faithless and rebels or commits suicide, we of the Yeteferen cannot show mercy for such a betrayal, as it is not only a betrayal to their lords but to our God Amilak. Thankfully, the threat of a dead slave's corpse being thrown into the Shadowswamp for their souls to be damned and reanimated as the undead is enough to keep even the most rebellious slave at bay."

Through the centuries, the presence of the Amazetany would provide not only capable minds but also aid in sourcing innovations and technological advancements from the urbanised north of Fahvanosy."

 L52_mercenary_turned_monarch_desc:0 "Perhaps the lowest point for Bamdikizy was when they found themselves not only subjugated by their rival Tibokbo, but beset by pirates from the black port of Oronsinoma. Having received no support from their overlord, the chieftess of Bamdikizy, Tsiomeko Jungleraised, scrounged all that the tribe could afford and hired a famed Mazava naval mercenary company to defend the coast - the Ranmaro company.\n\nThe steep price proved itself when the mercenaries swiftly brought the pirates to heel, despite facing fierce resistance and innumerable offers to turncoat. These repeated showings of valour and loyalty soon became the talk of the tribe. In particular, the company’s captain, Volana, was soon elevated to local hero for reportedly spitting on a chest of riches offered as a bribe before kicking it off her ship’s deck.\n\nYet one problem would be replaced by another when chieftess Tsiomeko Jungleraised passed away suddenly in 1412. The resulting power vacuum and chaos quickly caught the attention of Tibokbo, who saw an opportunity to end their vassal’s quasi-independence. Desperate for a new leader, the fractured Bamdikizy turned to the now loved Ranmaro company once more. This time they offered the mercenaries not coin but a place in the tribe with Volana as chieftess. Stirred by their pleas, Volana accepted. What followed was an independent Bamdikizy led by Volana Ranmaro, first of the Ranmaro dynasty. Together with her former mercenaries, Volana would raise Bamdikizy and her fleets to new heights."

 L52_the_ranmaro_system_desc:0 "When Volana Ranmaro rose to the throne of Bamdikizy she brought with her the great shipbuilding traditions of the Mazava. This tradition centred around training numerous artisans on one or two specific aspects of shipbuilding, creating a large group of highly experienced and specialised craftsmen. These craftsmen then would utilise their experience to create their aspect of a ship as efficiently and expertly as possible, allowing each piece to be brought together and assembled faster than any team could build a ship from scratch.\n\nVolana, however, sought  to apply Mazava ways not to build new seafaring vessels, but to restore the crumbled remains of Bamdikizy’s towns and infrastructure. By bringing together Bamdikizy’s craftsmen and workers, then organising them in the same manner but tasked with rebuilding homes and other constructions damaged in the recent civil strife, Volana was able to reinvigorate the tribe’s infrastructure and lay down a precedent for a new, efficient system for construction."

 L52_fombarifisa_desc:0 "In the latter half of the 15th century, a unique political philosophy arose among the court and government of Bamdikizy, known as Fombarifisa. The main principle of Fombarifisa was that to truly unite Fahvanosy a state would require aspects of all three Vyzemby cultures within its functions and upper echelons (key to this idea was the denial of the Fomarati as a separate culture from the Mboala). The prevalence of belief in Fombarifisa within the government meant that the state was more effectively able to integrate new lands."

 L52_specialisation_of_cavalry_desc:0 "While Bamdikizy would never come to rule Fahvanosy, it would make multiple attempts. To support those efforts, they began to breed and train new strains of war-dog, all from the original Bamdivy. These different breeds specialised to be  better suited to new terrain the warriors of Bamdikizy found themselves fighting on, such as the vast savannahs of the west coast, or serve different field roles in battle, such as seeking out the injured and carrying them back to Bamdikizy medics. With all these new uses for dogs, cavalry began to compose an even greater proportion of the nation’s armies."
 L52_specialisation_of_culture:0 "Specialisation of Culture"
 L52_specialisation_of_culture_desc:0 "Should Bamdikizy have come to rule all of Fahvanosy, they would have sought to do similarly to the halfling cultures what was done to the Bamdivy - specialisation into general roles in society. The Mboala would have served as warriors and rulers, also taking on the bardic aspects of the Fomarati, as the government would consider them Mboala. The Amazetany would have remained traders and innovators, while the Mazava farmed cloves and worked to produce and maintain a navy powerful enough to exert influence across Sarhal. By utilising the different traditions and perceived strengths of each culture most effectively, a Bamdikizy led Fahvanosy would no doubt have been more than the sum of the three peoples."

While Ioriel herself was the greatest guide to this new era, Kyliande takes pride in being among the first to bear their new elven culture. Morganne síl Kyliande, in marriage and conception to Alvarion Duskwatcher, began the transformation of the rough Lorenti into the refined Lorentish.\n\nNot far from Lorentainé and the Rewanwood before they became the Redglades, but far enough away from the bustling cities: Kyliande is where many Elves fell in love with the idyllic farmlands of the Upper Bloodwine.

Inseparable in their youth, they walked hand-in-hand by the Bloodwine, dreaming of their great future together. But the clarion call of war summoned Beltram and his father to fight against Black Castanor, leaving Morganne alone. Beltram fought valiantly at the Battle of Elderlan, the last counterattack by Castanor, where his lord father perished. Morganne soon found herself ruling both estates, as Beltram's mother had passed from sickness and her own father defenestrated.\n\nThe triumphant hero returned home to his beloved bride. A bittersweet wedding was hosted, a gloomy air of the dead lingering over them. Underneath the light of the full moon, Morganne paced through the gardens and met the most beautiful rose: Alvarion Duskwatcher. An exceptionally handsome elf, Alvarion found it no trouble to entrance and seduce the young duchess. And while the night was still young, Morganne took Alvarion to bed. Beltram too thought to pay his bride a visit and stumbled upon this encounter.\n\nThe broken vows between houses Kyliande and Ventis, and the marriage of Morganne and Alvarion, is considered one of the major catalysts for the conflicts that began shortly thereafter between the elvenized Lorentish and the traditional Lorenti."

Morganne found herself facing against the combined forces of Beltram and the Rewantis on their way to depose the elven queen, as well as her own head. War raged across Lorent for years, but the Siloriel crown persevered. The rebellious lands along the Bloodwine, as well as the remnants of the great Rewanwood, were partitioned amongst loyalists.\n\nFollowing the rebellion, the lands of the síl Kyliandes were greatly expanded as reward for their loyalty to Ioriel. Former lands of the Rewantis were distributed to Kyliande, including portions of the Rewanwood not incorporated into the Redglades. Years later, their woodlands would become something of much greater importance. \n\nDuring the Interregnum following the death of Empress Jexis and the fracturing of the Phoenix Empire, the half-brother of the slain empress sought revenge against Ioriel Redrose. Elisar the Bloodied’s army chased Ioriel to the eaves of the Redglades and met the final stand of the Queen’s protectors. All of Lorent’s finest warriors, even our champions of Kyliande, could not stop the Bastard Emperor from vengeance.

Their leader would become the legendary general Khasharagh; he forced the Hags to flee back into the swamp, and we had our first victory.\n\nWe have since fashioned a ring, made of the purest gold from the Veins of Sarhal, to house this Gem of Uthayus- “Black Skies.” The Ring of Uthayus has given our people a common purpose, stronger than any other: turn back the influence of the Night Hags, unite our people, and live in freedom once and for all."

When his two elder brothers unexpectedly died, Tivara inherited the realm from his father, and returned to rule his kingdom. From this small Setar state, he began his wars of consolidation - first taking the dry plains of the South and East Marutha, then striking the mighty Nadimraj and seizing its crown while it was embroiled in civil war.

In appreciation, she gave him a great treasure - a necklace of flawless peridot that shone with an inner light. The princess told Svrinrangam that the necklace would bless any who wore it with great fortune as long as they held love and filial piety in their heart.\n\n The first Rahenraja wore the necklace all the days of his life, and was well blessed by it. In the millenia that followed his life, the Peridot of Svrinrangam changed hands many times, bringing good luck to all who held it. It eventually landed in the hands of the Thousand Strikes Dynasty, a powerful clan that ruled the lands north of Dhenijansar from Djunadesh to Kramitra, and at first it seemed only to increase their fortune. When the Brother's War broke out, however, the house turned on itself, and the once radiant gems of the Peridot necklace turned sickly and murky. Their magic lost in the fratricidal conflict, the Peridot of Svrinrangam became a physical symbol of the Thousand Strikes clan’s internal division and the deep wounds running through Rahen in the fifteenth century."

When Amanapurna II succumbed to the Smothering Sickness, many supported Ganyakanar as his successor, but scheming by corrupt ministers saw Vijayswanath take the throne instead.

Small as a child, he was seen as a disappointment to his tutors – he had no skill in writing, no patience for books, no interest in learning the finer points of administration. But when he first took the field of battle to lead his father’s men during the Moderationist Revolt, his destiny became apparent. A natural born leader, a brilliant tactical mind, and a skilled and utterly unflinching warrior despite his diminutive size, Vasuvedar led his soldiers to victory time and time again, rapidly rising the ranks. Noticed by Amanapurna the Bloody himself for his successes, particularly on the field at the decisive battle of Satarsaya, he was elevated to his own Prahbia position on land once held by the Setarbul and bestowed with the clan name Iron Stripe for his noted willpower and resolve."

 R54_battle_of_satarsaya_desc: "In the year 1401, the combined moderationist armies assembled upon the Plains of Satarsaya, some thirty-thousand men strong, opposed only by the twelve-thousand Iron Tigers of Vasuvedar. Their elephants and horses charged us, but they fell and broke their legs in the concealed ditches we had prepared, and we waited. The enemy pelted us with arrows and sling bullets, but they pinged harmlessly off our unusually large shields, and still we waited.\n\n Then when this had failed, they charged us, but their charge was slowed, broken by the ditches; only then did we finally pounce. Nearly half of the rebel host fell to the army of the Iron Stripe, and the backbone of Dalapalar’s rebellion was broken. It was this battle that built the Iron Stripe’s legacy, and this commitment to discipline that remains at the core of its military tactics to this day."

Recognizing the vulnerable location of his holdings, Hemantsenar spent the four decades of his reign building a network of friendships, alliances, and spy networks across Rahen. These alliances built Parusahan Saya’s power and influence far beyond what could be expected of the small state, and Hemantsenar and his heirs were regular guests of Senaptia, great Ministers, and even the Raja himself. This alliance network formed the backbone of the resistance to the ascension of Ramapalar III in 1481, and was formalized into the Compact of Sephahan, by Amtujsaat when they declared Indira of the Bloody Claw unfit to serve as first minister and started the Wars of the Vizierate."

Acay the Younger, Raja of the Gold Banner, was slain on the field by the Greens, and his young son trampled in the rout that followed. Despite their many early successes, the fortunes of the Golds were utterly reversed by Nabukh, and the months that followed would see the grudging re-establishment of peace under Ramapalar III.\n\nUnknown to the courts of Rahen, however, Acay’s line was not extinguished at Nabukh. His daughter Aysha, believed lost in the same chaos that claimed her brother, had managed to escape the battlefield and fled to the court of Parusahan Saya. There she would live in hiding, wedding the young lord Kitir of the Iron Stripe, and birthing two sons by him – Golpalar and Hemantsen. The princess would tragically die at only 23 following the birth of her younger child, and missed seeing both boys return the line of Acay the Younger to the Lotus Throne in the coming decades."

As his rule progressed and saw the young man dominated by his vizier and ministers, Kitir of the Iron Stripe saw an opportunity to press his son Golpalar’s claim to the throne. Calling together the old gold banner faction, Kitir revealed the true parentage of his children, rallied his banners, and secured alliances with the Golden Paw and Starry Eye clans with betrothals between their daughters and his sons.\n\nIn the spring of 1498, the Iron Tiger pounced and infiltrated the fortress of Dhudhina in a swift and brutal campaign. Making extensive use of sappers, the city of Dhenijansar fell before him in just 6 weeks, and Vijayswanath II was forced to flee. The Iron Stripes and Golden Paw led a great triumph through the streets of the capital that culminated with the 6-year Goparlar III sitting the Lotus Throne as the first Iron Raja."

Unexpectedly inheriting the throne from his brother Gopalar III, his energy and optimism were a galvanizing force that powered the recovery that the Raj would experience in the first half of the 16th century. With his aid of his wife, Rani Jira of the Starry Eye, sweeping changes to the Raj's structure were enacted - the vizier was disempowered, the ministries reformed, and the armies of the realm modernized and centralized. These military reforms, incorporating lessons of the Wars of Vizierate and the elevations of the new senapti of Tujgal, Amtujsaat, and Banjisbid, allowed the Raj to repel the Jaddari at the Shenral pass in 1522 and push The Command back from Eastern Dhujat in a pair of wars waged during the 1530s.\n\n After the death of Rani Jira in 1556, however, Hemantsen's mind would begin to slow and much of the Raja's power would again fall to the Vizier, the Senapti of Amtujsaat. Ambitious lords restarted the short-sighted intrigues of the 1400s, culminating when the Imperious Stripes of Ghundagar triggered the 1561 Dhenbasana Uprising that marked the beginning of the end for the second Harimraj."

 L38_masana_legacy_desc: "Two thousand years ago, the refugees that would become the inhabitants of Rayafo sailed across from Saikinoma to the Vyzemby Isles. The man who led the fleet was the king of Saikinoma himself, Masana Meblic. Meblic was a young man who had grown up to become one of the most prestigious academics and cunning generals. Nobody could deny his talent, not even the king of Saikinoma, who allowed a young Masana to have his daughter’s hand in marriage. Now in the light of the public, he became perceived as generous for using the wealth gained through his various campaigns to improve the city of Saikinoma itself, and to give back to his people.\n\nEventually, once the old king of Saikinoma died with no heir, Masana stepped up to lead the nation.\n\nDuring the Meblic rule of Saikinoma, he conquered local cities and took the wealth of the rich to give back to the poor. He often personally traveled to the slums to deliver wealth and prosperity. Thus, Saikinoma as a kingdom grew to conquer and grow as a regional powerhouse. This brought fear to the kingdom of Kolonoma, who declared war on them to try and halt the great kings’ progress. Unfortunately for both of the cities, a new threat would arise. A grand human migration would storm the region, and after the battle with Kolonoma, Masana had to march back home to relieve his city from a horde of humans seeking to pillage. Masana had lost his wife and his kingdom, and only had his people left.\n\nThus, he expended all his wealth to build a fleet to save the citizens of Saikinoma from the human invasion, and to flee to the Summer Isles. In doing so, Masana Meblic reignited his people’s hope for a better life, and forged a new home in an unrecognized territory."

 L38_rayafosi_philosophy_desc: "The Amezatany nations are those composed of the mixture of peoples who originally inhabited the north of the Vyzemby isles, and those who fled from their cities in the mainland. This has resulted in a group of people who have forged their own unique culture compared to the rest of the isles. Rayafo, being a kingdom of refugees, holds their traditions from Saikinoma strongly. One such tradition is the ancient art of Philosophy.\n\nIt starts with the iltraray, the council who advises the king, kneeling on pillows around a blue flame cast by the mihipha. The iltraray then begin their discussion, with a general forum of no less than 300 people discussing the politics of the nation. Then, after the politics have been discussed, and nothing is left, the iltraray call upon the gods, and begin the true discussion.\n\nThere is to be a speaker, who shall be the lead of the conversation and the receivers. The speakers bring up a topic, and the receivers respond. Nobody is to go out of order, as it is disrespectful to interrupt the discussion. All ideas, concepts, or theories, brought forward must be depicted in great, vivid detail, usually through metaphors. Unlike regular discussion, the true discussion should not be limited by politics. Nature, life, and stories are frequently talked about. These discussions are said to bond the iltraray with life and the gods, and provide heavenly wisdom like no other."

 L38_experienced_settlers_desc: "When Masana Meblic was said to have taken off the shores of Saikinoma, Masana Meblic said to have seen a great light emanating from the west. It has been said that Meblic saw this as a sign to continue forward, and the refugees saw it as a blessing from their gods. Arriving onto the coast of the Vyzemby isles, Masana had begun to organize the many refugees, and began the Great Settlement. In honor of the great light that he saw, he named the first settlement Mapiltra, the Skyhome. The refugees-turned-settlers immediately began to reconstruct their homes, and establish themselves quickly in these new lands. They were dubbed the fire starters, from where the name Rayafo originates. Mapiltra grew exponentially, and the nearby lands of Tsomindy were settled by farmers, which funneled food into the city. Alafo would soon become a center for wood and materials, which would be used to make new buildings and fortifications.\n\nAnd thus, the kingdom of Rayafo was forged out of the dust of a fallen kingdom, and the Rayafosi had fully settled down into their new homes. With this, Masana Meblic peacefully passed at the age of 63, assured that the refugees could stand on their own."
 L38_thunder_of_the_waves: "Thunder of the Waves"
 L38_thunder_of_the_waves_desc: "Long ago, the Rayafosi rode ships to safety. Sailing across unknown waters and landing on unknown lands. Once they conquered the lands, we realized that the ships we once used to arrive here were still docked at bay. What was the purpose of having ships and not using them? Thus, the ships were renovated, and former sailors who had once guided the Rayafosi away from tragedy would now guard the coast of Rayafo. Pirates struggled to break their waters as the eternal fleet stood by, everpresent.\n\nUnfortunately for the Rayafosi, they failed to maintain their navy. Pirates came less frequently, and soon were near foreign to our coast. They would have benefitted from converting our fleet into trade vessels, but by then the economy had been whittled down by trying to maintain such a large fleet for war. Now they had once again been docked at port, and some faced irreparable damage. Thus, the ships were scrapped for parts, and only a few would remain.\n\nNow though, if we are to retake Saikinoma, a navy is needed. Our legacy of pirate hunting sailors is strong, and the manpower is there! There is a need for ships, for if we are going to retake our homes, then we will need an armada."

 L38_collaborative_effort_desc: "The Rayafosi people work hard to make sure the nation as a whole can sustain itself. The weakest links are to be strengthened, and the strongest links should bear more of the weight from the weak. This is an integral part of why Rayafo as a nation has been able to survive and grow for two thousand years after we abandoned the city of Saikinoma. The wealthy should help the poor, a lesson carried from Masana Meblic’s generosity to the impoverished. The Meblic dynasty has had a history of delivering their riches to the poor, directly funding change.\n\nAn effect of this system is that the Rayafosi are some of the wealthiest in the Vyzemby isles. It is often unheard of for even the poorest to go hungry."

 L38_manja_science_desc: "Science is important.\n\nTo evolve as a society, science must be one of the core tenets of its people. If it is not, then it is the law of nature to drag their kingdoms back into the dust and let the cycle begin anew. We have tried our best to prove ourselves to fate that we are worthy of bearing our kingdom even after thousands of years. Science is one of the ways we try to show our prowess.\n\nWe are strict to what and what shall not receive funding by our king. If our king feels a project worthy of his time, then he himself shall overlook the scientists to make sure they stay on task and that they accomplish what they set out to do. This way, science works for the Rayafosi in a way like no other. When in times of war, we devote our scientists to creating new weapons and tools that could give us an advantage on the field. When at peace, we focus on developing our cities and strengthening our home security.\n\nThis has led to massive scientific developments across our country, and a unique system where innovators work for us. This is shown in the Mapiltra University, where historically, some of the finest weapons in all of Sarhal have been invented and allowed us in our times of need to defend ourselves. \n\nWhether it be a spear or a new invention to drive our economy: if we believe in its importance, we will make it."

 L38_heavenly_cities_desc: "When Masana Meblic arrived in Mapiltra, its lands were comprised of forests that are now relegated to the jungles of Alafo. The refugees cut them down, and used them for our foundations. From the wood we were given the cities of Tsomindy, The Skyhome, and Alafo. Once new settlers arrived into the Vyzemby isles, fleeing the same crisis, gaining the island city of Nosivy. These were the four original Heavenly Cities, of which the Rayafosi have settled and improved over hundreds of years.\n\nEach of these cities are governed by people appointed by the king. They are chosen not by title, but by skill and proven worthiness. They are tasked with maintaining order and continuous development. Through this process the prosperity of the cities is ensured, and the king may look towards the outside without needing to look back."

For two decades he had both Cannorians and Ynnics join his ranks to demolish the systems of old and introduce reforms and Ravelianism. However, many had opposed his rule, the devout Ynn River worshippers, the nobility as well as the other Cannorians that he had subjugated. With such success his ambition reached new heights as he attempted to unify the entire Ynn, before being halted by the Western-Lands coalition. With victorious battles, but growing weariness, Jahanon  ventured to the legendary city of Lukausta on a journey to achieve immortality, but was later declared dead with his Ravelian rectors, last seen venturing into Lukaus’ tomb."

Our shamans summon currents in the sands to propel unique sleds called sand skimmers across them like water, shuttling people and goods across the desert at incredible speeds.

Rather than relent to the desert’s oppressive heat, she persisted. For days, the gnoll wandered the desert surviving off what little the land had to offer.\n\nYet even with her iron will, the Salahad would have certainly taken her had our founder not encountered the council of shamans who had been on their own decades-long desert exodus. As if expecting to meet her, they gifted her the name Irkorzik and pledged their support to her, declaring her their leader. The subjugation of the other lesser Windhowler packs that had declared independence in the wake of Viakkoc's collapse soon followed, giving rise to our pack.\n\nThe following years were a prosperous and stable time for our people. As such, before her passing our Pack Mistress made a final decree. Succession of the Irkozik pack would not be decided by bloodline nor bloody infighting, but through proving their strength and skill in the Salahad, and those who succeed would take on the name Irkorzik themselves.

However, one day a group of Delta Gnomes wearing curious attire were encountered traveling through the desert as if it was nothing. Upon inquiring about the suits, they explained that they were \"survival suits\" that keep the wearer cool. They offered to manufacture simpler versions for us for a small fee, which we agreed to.

Whilst our tribe produces many great warriors, only the finest of them earn the honour of serving as a sentinel, protecting all Fangaula from the prophesied return of the dreadful demi-lich.

It was strange enough that his song, magically amplified and echoing out in the eerie Rhada throat-call reserved for funerals, should bring these cursed beasts from the west to such utter stillness, right on the eve of their victory. Stranger too, that the hulking Nukhzat should then ask to parlay. Several hours passed, and the drumming rain leached the blood from the grass. By the time they reemerged, Nukhzat was Ashakani’s faithful western shield. Aguntat, the last and gentlest of his father’s line, was the convert-king of two peoples. How could he of all people deny the civilising power of song?"

As provision of art to the population was considered a source of great civic clout, nobles began to install akhune, recesses in their compound walls, from which performers would play for passers-by. These akhune became larger and more elaborate over time, acquiring seating, complex staging and eventually even free refreshment and food. Ubiquitous street music and theatre would become one of the most distinct features of life in Ashakani, and the subject of numerous early printed guides for locals and visitors alike."

All conscious beings must resist the worst instincts of their nature and improve themselves. The spark of intelligent thought, that same spark which allows us to perceive and appreciate beauty, also allows us to resist the meaningless chatter of frustrations and worries which we receive from the world, and instead channel our energies into positive creation and cooperation. This principle of emotional self-restraint profoundly permeates our political discourse."
 L85_bloodglass:0 "Bloodglass"

The fine sand of the Khusadza shore made for a glass of unusual resilience and malleability, spurring a sixteenth century explosion of martial and memorial art, primarily in a deep-red and clear scheme known as bloodglass. Ashakani glass-art of this period is characterised by asymmetrical composition and the ‘khirop’, the sense of arrested movement - a spear almost striking the neck of a warrior, a vase about to smash, an abstract shape seemingly on the verge of collapsing. It is a metaphor for our natures as conscious beings, always in tension, a decision away from losing ourselves."

We have renovated and furnished it so grandly and completely that all visitors will realise the splendour of our nation and of our heritage.\n\nOur king sits upon an ebony throne flanked by elephant tusks and shaded by a large silk parasol topped with a silver donkey. To his left stands his court Jelli, who carries a silver three stringed sintir, the high priest, and the court healer bearing the horn of the mythical Abada, an antidote to poison and disease. To his right stands the royal executioner, the king’s planetouched bodyguard, two of the king’s favourite white horses, and two rams to protect against the evil eye.

In the hands of the Binwarji, the ritual lost all religious pretence. It became entertainment for the nobles and lower class, as well as a way to showcase the cultures and peoples subjugated by the Fangaulan Empire’s military might. Frequently, former soldiers of conquered peoples would be forced to fight in arenas for their conquerors’ amusement.

The cultures around us create sculptures that could never be fooled for the real thing while our artisans have created  ivory, terracotta, bronze, and wood artworks that are extremely lifelike. There are even legends that one bronze sculpture was so enchanting that its artist attempted to marry it. Many foreigners admire our artistry, with Cannorian traders even spreading the rumour that a long lost tribe of dwarfs must reside within our borders, due to the profound craftsmanship of our sculptures.

After spending months among these isolated Kaino peoples he returned with A new republican system that was inspired by his time among these isolated Kaino tribes.

It was a direct democracy on the village level with a representative assembly elected by village elders, mages, priests, secret societies, representatives of the Council of Women and all male adults. Diakarida was convinced that this system would lead to his province and eventually the empire to become more flexible, adaptable and fair, preventing the tragedy of the twin xhaz invasion.

A golem needs no pay, no safety requirements, and is stronger than a human laborer. Thus genies became widely used across Negefaama in construction and engineering projects, helping to build monuments that would have been impossible for humans to produce."

Negefaama, already closely connected to Cannor through trade and diplomacy, quickly converted to Ravelianism, becoming one of the first nations in Sarhal to do so. With their quick and easy conversion, Negefaama created a strong alliance with Ravelian powers in Cannor, which helped stave off foreign domination by playing Cannorian powers off of eachother."

Yet when he visited the savanna he fell in love with its beauty and great animals to hunt. He loved it so much after his travels he decided to resettle his entire people to the savannah. They adapted so well to the land that when the king died he was reborn into the first lion Fojara. Whenever a Ndurubun dies they are reborn as a lion and whenever a lion dies they are reborn as a Ndurubun. That is why the Ndurubu people possess blond hair, and why we share their bravery.

When asked by a Cannorian trader about their role in Taafi society, a Jelli responded with the parable of Makan and the king of gods Aro, where the conquering god Aro forces Kanhati, the god of death and wisdom, to teach Makan manners after Makan mocked Aro constantly in front of the other gods. Kanhati confronted Makan and their war of words turned into a game of wits, which Makan won.

When she appears she plays her drum and the people, no matter their misery or sadness, will be able to dance and laugh and gain the determination to look down at their oppressors and foster small acts of rebellion. This angered the goddess Biakata and she allied with the gnoll goddess to destroy Makan's drum, causing her to learn the feeling of loss and sadness. In her search around the world to find a new drum to replace her broken one she eventually finds her “drum heart” , the drum every person has that one must play to become truly free. The story is told among slaves and rebels to build their courage to cast down their kings, slavers and tyrants using their inner strength.

Eventually we grew curious about the stars and the planets - curiosity that was rewarded with a madness born from looking upon the void above the skies of Halann too long. Finally after years of searching the skies with great care and replacing those driven mad with new sages, we uncovered a great grave secret of the dark creatures that hide between the stars. Unfortunately, this drew the attention of one of the dark gods. It descended into our dreams, driving most of our people mad. The few surviving sages led us off the island and performed a ritual to make the Taafi forget the island existed, and it disappeared into the mists shortly after.This story, our most secret, is known only from tattoos that were placed on the backs of those sages who did the ritual, and which we mark our wisest with still."

Uniquely, this centralization occurred not through warfare, but through common consensus and diplomacy.

When the Jakatany of Kolonoma, who had fled south to Sovalelnosy, realized that the island was safe, he immediately sailed there to use it as his vantage point for retaking Kolonoma. The Jakatany's arrival was greeted with massive celebrations and festivities; more specifically, celebrations and festivities at his public execution as a deserter and traitor. Since then, Tiboktsamo has never declared itself a kingdom, and none of its rulers has assumed any title other than tower commander.

In addition to its defensive properties, the Ikilshebe soon came to appreciate this leather for its aesthetic value, and the elites of the kingdom competed amongst themselves in hunting the most beautifully scaled lizardfolk, turning them into magnificent armor as a way to show their status and stand out in battle. There is a particular preference for the serpentine naga, whose scales only the greatest chiefs and the kings wear.

The curves of its arches accentuate the fountains and statues that linger within, each a masterpiece in its own right with their flawless likenesses to heroes from the past. The central landmark of Gakha-dak are the Whistling Stones, a series of uniquely shaped stone statues with holes in them that, when the wind blows at just the right angle, plays a grand tune.

Their screams would last for hours even after their deaths as the Raktaya, enveloped in shadow, marched over their bodies. Even the rival Raktayas of other lands learned to avoid the Khagaarsa in battle, as one scream of the torment it caused was enough warning for them to flee rather than fight."

The great general Ayrarsa was an outlier even amongst the Karachan population; the records say that she was a titanic being boasting a height of over 3 meters, who could throw a spear over a long range with pinpoint accuracy. Her enchanted spear remains to this day at the base of our mountains, thrown from ramparts above, still impaling her last enemy; serving as a warning to those who threaten the Karachan mountains.

Despite their isolation, the allure of Karachan bounty proved too much for others, blinded by our glorious mountains, and never a year passed without thieves caught trying to outsource our wealth. If not our wealth then our techniques, the years of knowledge our smiths and artisans have generated, are surely unimaginable to these resourceless people.

Every farmer of Shelokmengi became adept at skills that were also useful in administration, and so the kings of Shelokmengi found no shortage of competent administrators among the population.\n\nThis great administrative skill was best embodied in Yemane ‘The Secretary’. Born a farmer, Yemane originally owned only a small piece of land. His great administrative skills and wit allowed him to increase the yields of his farm manyfold, and he began to increase the yields of other farms in the local villages. Eventually, he would be noticed by Ayufari II during one of his yearly harvest processions, was recognized for this skill, and hired as the king’s personal secretary.\n\nYemane would be a crucial advisor to Ayufari II for most of his reign, being responsible for many administrative reforms in the kingdom.

This changed with the rise of Adurmag the Dreadful, however, and in 1458, an army of trolls invaded Shelokmengi with the goal of burning the whole of the Yet river and sacking the great city of Yetmetsira by the ocean. With the Angelic Host seemingly too far away to send aid, Shelokmengi was forced to act alone. Leaning on their administrative skills, they raised a force of 10,000 men in one month and marched to the city of Berfan, directly in the path of the advancing Trolls.\n\nAt the gates of Berfan, Shelokmengi made its stand. An army of farmers armed with shotel and spear met the trolls in dense formations and showed no fear. When the trollish charge came, the men of Shelokmengi did not break. They held, hour after hour, refusing to yield despite their losses. And then, when the troll’s might seemed too great, the Angelic Host arrived. The armies of Kamniel had been shadowing the trollish horde, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and  now hit the rear of the enemy, cutting off their retreat.

His young son was left in the hands of a squabbling regency council, bent on turning the young king Ayufari II into a puppet.\n\nWhen Ayufari II came of age to rule, however, he was not what the lesser-kings expected him to be. One of the most capable and ruthless administrators of his day, he was keen to crack down on those that had led his father to ruin, including the former members of the regency council. He stamped out the corrupt nobles, confiscating the lands of those that dared defy him and placing loyalists into their positions.\n\nBy the time Ayufari reached the age of 38, he had completely destroyed any internal resistance in his kingdom. Thus he finally declared war on Enikmesiki, seeking revenge for his fathers murder and hunting those nobles who had fled his vengeance. He at last took the city where his father had been killed in 1474, his revenge complete.\n\nYears later, when asked what his thoughts of the Enikmesiki “incident” was, he quipped, “Enikmesiki may have been a catastrophe, but it was also a blessing in disguise.”"

These processions acted as moving harvest festivals, with massive amounts of food given away for free. It was very common for the harvest processions of Shelokmengi to move into other kingdoms, as the kings of Shelokmengi sought to flaunt their wealth in the face of their rivals.

This massive water gate which often lies open may be closed at any point by the river guards if a boat refuses to pay the toll, in turn creating massive congestion of ships earning the boat both the ire of Aranmas and fellow traders, forcing them to pay the toll whatever it may be.

This spread of Ravelian ideas culminated in Aranmas, with a state-sponsored lodge being founded in the city.

It was through his fighting and aid in the War of the Sorcerer-King that he would be elevated to nobility in the Treaty of Anbenncóst, and the disputed county that would become Teagansfield given to him.\n\nEven after his death, the idea that a lowborn could achieve nobility through fighting and his words inspired residents of Teagansfield to join local militias and eventually, the military of the Empire of Anbennar.

With other races often finding themselves meandering about as they stop for the toll, knowing several languages has become commonplace amongst merchants and common man alike.

He also reformed the cavalry and completely abandoned the concept of Outriders in favor of heavily-armed lancers. These cavalrymen, calling themselves the Lasmarcai, were clad in the best armor available, and their lances were extended to enable devastating charges against ranks of enemy infantry weakened by gunfire. According to this concept, combat usually began with a slow advance of two ranks of infantry against enemy formations.

As a result, Laseáni vintners have developed something new. While technically not a wine, grain wine is seen with a similar reverence and referred to as such by those in Laseán. Slightly stronger than ordinary wine or beer, usually made from grains of rye or wheat, this pale wine-like drink, also called "Laseán Pale", is the pride and glory of the duchy.

His main supporters were the Vurebindu natives, tired of the Confederacy's oppressive taxation and of being treated like second-class citizens, although many Irsukuba also joined his ranks. This revolt would manage to successfully topple the Confederacy, replacing it with a centralized empire led by Kui and his descendents, who to this day still sit on the throne of Kuiika. \n\nUnder the wise leadership of Kui the empire achieved great splendor and prosperity, controlling all of modern day Horashesh at its peak, but his successors were not up to the task. The state slowly declined, with its borders being reduced to the immediate area of the Kuiziva lake and eventually becoming just another subject of Kheterata.

To remedy this he organized them into legions of 5000 men and put them through a harsh and short but effective training, which both prepared them for combat and thoroughly indoctrinated them to be unconditional fighters for Kui’s cause. These new troops proved incredibly effective, and Kui was able to not only push back the Ikursuba Confederation, but also to unify Horashesh under his command.

This is called the Kuiziva Festival, and during it a great procession marches around the shore of the lake, led by a giant wooden effigy of Kui carried on the backs of 10 men and 10 women, rotating every hour so that as many people as possible can receive the honor of being a carrier. The effigy is accompanied by bands of musicians and poets loudly proclaiming praises and playing songs dedicated to Kui, and followed by seemingly endless masses of both pious peregrines and curious tourists from all over the world. The procession makes 4 stops, one every last day of a week, during which massive amounts of free food and alcohol are distributed and the people dance and sing until the next day dawns. In the fourth and final stop the effigy of Kui is loaded onto a great raft along with many offerings of both food and valuable objects, and they will all be covered in oil and rowed to the center of the lake by 10 men and 10 women volunteers. Only one of them stays in this raft, usually a very devout and old individual who sets the raft, and themselves with it, on fire while thousands watch silently from the shore. This ends the festival with a fiery sacrifice, giving back to the lake a little portion of what it gives to them."

During the Partition of Ruvuma Kuiika seized the port of Bud Vanhu, which made the lack of a naval force a worrying issue. Their former ally of Zuvavim, now turned competitor, had a powerful fleet that could wreak havoc unopposed in their newly obtained coast if they wished to do so. To remedy this the ruler at the time decided to undertake an ambitious naval build-up program, hiring a crew of Vizemby shipbuilders led by a particularly ambitious halfling, who promised that they could deliver a hundred ships within a year. As it turns out, building a hundred ships from scratch in a year from a single port with an improvised shipyard isn’t really possible, so the shipbuilders had only finished 10 ships when the term expired. This was still an impressive feat, and the techniques developed by the shipbuilders to try to reach this impossible self-imposed goal helped to significantly develop Kuiikan shipmaking."

It tells that in the first years of his reign the kingdom faced a devastating drought, and to avoid famine Kenmu imported shipments of grain, imposing high taxes on the nobility to pay for it. The nobles were of course outraged, and to calm them down Kenmu invited the most powerful ones to his palace to discuss the issue. \n\nOnce there he bade them pass into his garden, telling them that they would talk about the taxes after observing some beautiful roses recently planted. The twelve most prominent malcontents entered first, and after them the king stopped the rest and told them to wait, as some weeds had been found among the roses and they needed to be cut immediately, so that they wouldn't tarnish the beauty of the roses.\n\nWhen he finally let the nobles pass, they were horrified to see the 12 decapitated heads of their colleagues piled in a cart. The king smiled and said that he was sorry for the wait, but that he hoped that, now that the weeds had been cut, only roses remained in the garden."

The people of Kuiika firmly embraced this idea, and the cult of Kui was the state and majority religion of the country during most of its history, with his divinity being accepted as a fact as evident as the sky being blue and water being wet. However, with the spread of Ravelianism in the nation this fact started being disputed, which caused the monarchy to oppose the new faith initially, as the ruling dynasty claimed to be descendants of Kui and their legitimacy benefited greatly from his assumed divinity. A compromise was soon reached, as the queen at the time believed embracing Ravelianism would speed the modernization of the nation. Kui may not be a god, but he would be a Saint, and so it was arranged. In a great ceremony coinciding with the celebration of the Kuiziva festival, which was attended by the High Rector Torrieth herself, the founder of Kuiika was officially canonized as Saint Kui, the queen was converted and Ravelianism became the new official faith of the kingdom of Kuiika, who would become the main diffuser of the truth of the One God in the region."

 Z01_the_mages_peace_desc:0 "The Empire of Anbennar was first established at the Grand Summit of Aranthíl in 1221 AA.\n\nFor a small group of like-minded mages and their supporters among the Cannorian nobility, the time of secrecy had ended. They declared their leader, Delian Whitecloak, the first Emperor of Anbennar. The lands around the Dameshead had known naught but war and chaos for decades, even centuries - some elven warriors hadn't seen a lasting peace since their arrival in Cannor. Delian Whitecloak and his compatriots envisioned an end to the endless conflict, brought about through a force that could cut through any king, any army: magic.\n\nThe Interregnum lasted sixty years. In six months, it was over. From Vertesk to Verne, from Beepeck to Bennon, warlords set aside their differences and their long standing feuds in the name of unity. Many had to be compelled to do so, through domination or destruction, but in the end they all welcomed the new peace.\n\nSince then, mages have held incalculable influence over the Empire's affairs. Only a mage could sit the Dove Throne. Magical ability was a requirement for legitimate succession. Even when the regime of Mage-Emperors came to an end during the Wars of Rule, they were replaced by the Magisterium, which ruled over the institutions of magic throughout much of Cannor, and controlled an Imperial electorate for centuries. While that influence has waxed and waned over the years, the notion that extraordinary abilities wielded by extraordinary people can change the world has remained.\n\nAnbennar, arise! There will be peace once again."

[He] told them that the future of Anbennar would be decided by silver and steel.\n\nA colorful sea of faces squinted and pursed their lips - the future? The Emperor spoke as if the great task was still ahead, not behind them. What could he mean? It was a simple yet effective rhetorical gambit - the curious audience listened in rapt attention as the Emperor expounded on the meaning of their words.\n\nSilver is the Empire's color, of its banners, of its coinage, of its diplomacy. Silver for the moon, or perhaps for Castellos. The influence of the half-elven Silver Families runs deep, as does, of course, their blood descent. The memory of the heroic Silver Band that expelled the Sorcerer King lives on in song and story. Silver arms kept evil at bay, and silver tongues brought the imperial princes together.\n\nSteel is simpler. Steel for the spears of Verne, for the muskets of the Vanbury Guild, for the guns of Giberd. Steel from the foundries of Telgeir and the forge of Anvilwright. The lessons of half a hundred different military traditions and industrial practices will power the Empire's march into the future."

And yet this dream was bartered for in the blood of thousands with the end of the Interregnum. After thirty years of peace came the Wars of Rule, and thirty years of chaos and civil war. In 1277, the Imperial Parliament and the Electoral College were established to give the multifarious people of the Empire a voice.\n\nIstralore, to represent the nobility of the east.\nPearlsedge, to represent the nobility of the west.\nBeepeck, to represent the halflings, the most numerous minority.\nSilverforge, to represent the dwarves, the great miners and craftsmen of the Havoral mountains.\nMoonhaven, to represent the elves, the most influential minority.\nDamescrown, to represent the merchant class, and, in time, the northern nobility.\nAnd finally, the Magisterium, representing the mages, and the former governing body of the Empire.\n\nYet this too led to conflict, with the Silmuna Grand Dukes of Dameria practically guaranteed the Dove Throne by the support of the electors Istralore and Pearlsedge, their leal vassals - a situation that the powerful lords of Arbaran, Wex, and others would never fully accept. The Lilac Wars (1348-1443) very nearly tore the Empire apart for good. But despite all the odds, the Empire stands united, together, forever."

The Ruin and the subsequent War of the Falling Stars between the Damerian Republic, Castanor, and the Gnomish Hierarchy laid waste to the region, but not for long. Wealth would continue to flow from the Divenhal to the ever-growing cities lining the Dameshead. The Dragonwake, the White Pestilence - in the course of history, these disasters were no match for geography and economics. The old cities made room, or at least provided construction material, for the new. The gnome-ruled Beepeck was rebuilt into a halfling-ruled Beepeck. The mouth of the Alen suited a city, and so a city arose; it did not matter if Vertesk was ruled from Castonath or Gaweton, or if its citadel tower was white or black. Damenath gave way to Damucen, which became known as Anbenncóst when the seas brought the elven Remnant Fleet to the Damesear.\n\nTruly, these tranquil shores have seen the tides of history crash and rage amongst them. There is the legacy and the destiny of the Empire and its peoples. As the Crownsmen saying goes, a ruler makes history, but wealth makes a ruler. The Empire of Anbennar shall rule the Dameshead, and with it, the wealth of the world. And what else could come next?"

Soldiers of Emperor Lothane III marched through the capital of Anbenncóst, not in glory, but amidst flames, and carrying away loot. The Rose and Moon Parties licked their wounds and sharpened their daggers, and the Electors all but openly disregarded the emperor's will; Lothane III may have been a terror on the battlefield, but he was an old man, a Wexonard without silver lineage, with only a human's lifespan. Another, stronger and wiser, or maybe one more willing to "forgive" and "compromise", would soon come into the Dove Throne. After all, the success of a great man - or woman - with the will to dominate and restructure the Empire would come at the expense of the Empire's privileged princes. And if worst came to worst, the princes could always call upon Crothán to furnish a 'legal scholar' to defend their rights in the Imperial Court for a couple of decades.\n\nNonetheless, the Empire - with some considerable help from a certain faction - pulled itself together. The smaller states agreed to a new model of centralization that would protect them from the depredations of their larger neighbors. A common tax was levied for the first time in centuries. The Imperial Parliament was consolidated and streamlined into a functional legislature, with a permanent session. The Imperial Estates and the Prince-Electors were brought to heel, and with the revocation of the Privilege Against Appeal, the Emperor was once again the supreme authority of the realm. And who could possibly dissent? It was either the petty strife of individual, independent princes... Or a single nation, with purpose indivisible, capitulating only to the Dove Throne."

But Anbennar is not a gust of wind, ephemeral and passing.\n\nThe Empire's Coat of Arms is marshaled by quartering: in the first and fourth with the elvenized moon of Dameria, the symbol of the Kingdom, then the Grand Duchy of Dameria. In heraldry, this positioning is often reserved for the most prestigious titles. The moon represents the roots of the Empire in the Damerian Republic, ruled from Damesear, with a Parliament hearkening to the old Senate. Informally, and to a degree only formerly, the moon represents the Silver Families, especially the Silmunas. In the second quarter is the silver dragon, Castellos, for Castanor, the ancient empire of humankind and the original rulers of the Dameshead. In the third quarter is the golden phoenix of the Jaherian Empire, whose scion, Jexis, was the last great emperor to rule the lands that now form the Empire; her realm collapsed into the Interregnum with her death in 1161 AA. The inescutcheon features a dove carrying a branch: a symbol of peace.\n\nDameria, Castanor, and the Phoenix Empire - the heritage of Anbennar covers much of Halcann. Even its core territories around the Dameshead have been historically difficult to govern - as the unifier knew well. The reborn Anbennar must reform its administration even further, adopt new techniques and mobile doctrine to respond to any needs, any threats throughout the Empire."

Though every Smallmarcher is prepared to die in battle for his home, many swear by lucky charms and other little rituals to stave off death for another day. These superstitions have since spread throughout the rest of the neighbouring provinces—just before Lorent and Dameria clashed upon their fields beneath the dusky lilac sky at the Battle of Bigwheat, outsiders noted that locals were seen nailing horseshoes upon their doors as protective talismans against death and destruction."

Quickly becoming popular among working-class halflings, it has since evolved into a beloved staple across the region, recognised as a symbolic national dish that evokes the Small Country Rebellion’s agrarian roots.

The Kneadsbridge Barrow turned out to have housed the tomb of Cerda, a near-mythical tribal king mentioned in old Halfling folklore, and produced some of the most spectacular grave goods ever found in the Small Country; the barrow's silver and gold regalia of ancient Halfling design notably inspired a popular jewelry brand in the Small Country with similar motifs of complex geometric shapes and animals."

However, due to local alliances and Simegasa’s main rival, Matamot, the kings of house Hajo-Abera were never able to achieve their goals.\n\nIn 1442, after another failed attempt at expansion, Dejen II in an act of desperation secretly made a pact with the hags, who promised him the lands of the frontier in return for subservience. In late 1444, he invaded the lands to the west that bordered the swamp. During the campaign, the soldiers of Simegasa noticed how weakened the enemy armies were, as if they were surrounded by bad luck and miasma. In truth, the hags had used their vile magics to weaken Dejen’s enemies.\n\nAt the battle of Sodikant, the combined armies of Dubishan, Tikur Adanyi, and Poson clashed with Dejen’s forces. Utilizing his superior cavalry, he employed hammer-and-anvil tactics to crush his enemies. The Simegasans gave no mercy, with less than a thousand of the enemy escaping with their lives. Dejen II would then annex the 3 kingdoms, tripling the size of Simegasa in a single day.\n\nOn the 14th of Nerament, 1444, Dejen II would be found upon his throne, a glowing purple brand etched upon his forehead, having become an undead slave to the hags.

This led to waves of warriors, bandits, and vagabonds pouring into Simegasa’s borders to join its army, solving Simegasa’s manpower problem.\n\nThe edict would be expanded by Simegasa’s rulers over time. By the late 16th century, the edict forgave debts, crimes, sins, and more, as long as one joined Simegasa’s army. This led to a common punishment for criminals in Mengi kingdoms: exile to Simegasa."

Mages would be employed to keep the fake floor over the pit solid enough for hundreds of trolls to stand upon it.

The locals understand this is but a cycle and that, like a wheel, history will round-about once more—though they wish they didn’t have to be, Greymillers’ lads will be ready.

Individually no match for the shapeshifters, the chiefs of the region agreed to form a confederation in order to force the warband from their lands and better defend against future raids.\n\nThis confederation works much like the typical Mengi system of personal loyalty between Lesser Kings and a King, but the King has fewer privileges and is elected for life from and by the Lesser Kings.

It is common to see travelling holy men wading or swimming through the swamplands, moving from village to village to tell varied tales and sing for the Amilak’s glory. Should a holy man ever be found without any part of him submerged, he would be considered to have betrayed his position as a servant of Amilak.

However, Kidsit Yitsi has existed with its current political structure and rough current area for centuries, and claims to be the imagined final kingdom of the Sitewosi. For the Kings, the coalescing of the region’s disparate chiefdoms into a single entity is a symbol of unity that has inspired Kidsit Yitsi to endure Tanizu raids and troll incursions - and that raises them above the fractured Kingdoms of the other Mengi.\n\nThis ideology of unity to face off adversity meant that, when the Angel Kamniel shattered the hordes of Yezel Mora and declared the Kingdom of Melakmengi, the Kings of Kidsit Yitsi saw it as the natural path of the supposed final Sitewosi Kingdom to be absorbed into the seemingly final Mengi Kingdom.

With this new availability of useful wood, an innovative construction method began to emerge in the region. By driving vast numbers of timber stakes into areas of the swamp, a large, solid, and stable surface could be created - the wood petrifying until practically stone.

Unfortunately for them, while they may have succeeded in erasing history, they could not erase its effects; distrust and open hostility to their influence permeates our society.

While it might be prudent to keep this knowledge to ourselves, it would be a shame to bar entry to aspiring minds, especially when they have much to offer in exchange. There are those among these travellers known as artificers, who create devices to harness magic without needing to cast it oneself. We allow them to access a carefully vetted portion of the library's contents in exchange for their assistance in fostering this practice amongst our people, to great benefit. Artificery has opened the door to an endless sea of possibilities for us, finally shifting the balance in power between the Naga and our intellectual class."

The increase in artificery among our people created unease amongst the Naga, whose magical abilities legitimised their social status. With the power they wielded becoming less relevant, they urged their puppet king to disband the growing artificer’s guild and outlaw the practice, lest these new ideas lead to a revolution. In seeking to avoid it, they brought the revolution on themselves. \n\nThe noble house of Katalend, who themselves became prominent in recent years due to their adoption of artificery, took the ban as a hostile declaration towards their house itself, and struck back against the regulations. A majority of the populace took to their cause, having seen first hand how beneficial artificer technology was to their daily lives. Together they swiftly ousted the ruling dynasty, replacing them with the house of Katalend. Ever since, they have passed vast reforms to strip the Naga of their power, in favour of the artificers they attempted to oust.

However, they allow for intricate work and precision that simply cannot be achieved by those with harder, sharper claws.

As such, in order to defend ourselves and stake our claim in this world, we must adapt. Firearms have become more commonplace, changing from a useful addition to one's arsenal to standard issue for entire armies. The only striking issue is the time it takes to reload one once fired, as it leaves one exposed and defenceless for up to a minute in the heat of battle. However, the same artistic precision our mutations give us could also be used in this reloading process. With some adjustments to the structure of the weapon, our long claws can be used as ramrods, and to quickly operate its machinery, allowing the firearm to be ready to fire again before the smoke even clears. These modifications may sacrifice a degree of speed and accuracy of our bullets, but are heavily made up for by our fire rate, which outclasses our opponents by wide margins."

The swamp-dwelling Sitewosi rejected the migrants, and eventually forced them away. Still, the Tanizu were not deterred, and continued onwards, eventually crossing the Yet River and settling in the lands of Layinret. Though the king of the land was welcoming at first, he sent his soldiers upon our camps, and were it not for the shifters, our ancestors would’ve met their end upon that night.

And it came in 1210, when a scion of the then-exiled royal of Fuulmana led a rebellion against Averilibet, and managed to wipe out 2 different Averilibeti armies that were sent in response.\n\nUsing his diplomatic skills, the new king of Fuulmana managed to convince the Averilibeti to let him pay tribute to them in return for independence. This let the Averilibeti cut their losses, while also keeping their pride."

He, along with his followers that accompanied him, settled down not too far away in a set of jungles to the east of Dugiti, founding the settlement of Fuulmana. He started a new school of glass-making in the new village, focusing on quality and using glass as a construction material. While many at the time laughed at Singas for proposing such an idea, he sought to make it reality. While he would die before seeing his dream become a reality, his protegee managed to turn glass into a viable construction material.

It was no coincidence then that a Fuulmanan would find themselves amongst the highest ranks of Kamniel’s and later Melakmengi’s diplomatic corps, for the Fuulmana had become known by many for being the messengers or ‘voice’ of the angel."

But in the early 12th century came those beastmen, an uncouth crowd of peasants who had no regard for our culture and way of life. After our southern cousins kicked them out of the swamp, they fled north to our lands. King Harafari II, following his kind nature, welcomed the migrants, and let them set up camp in lands. A foolish mistake, for the beasts started ravaging our lands, insulting our soldiers, and most daring of all, denigrating the one God himself.\n\nOnce Harafari II learned of this, his kindness turned to fury. He ordered his army to “drive the heathens from my lands!”. Thus in the middle of the night, his army ambushed the beastmen. We hoped they would flee our lands from this. How were they supposed to know the monstrous strength these shifters had? The shifters, after slaughtering our army, marched upon our capital, razing it to the ground.\n\nIt has been centuries since that time, yet our kingdom still stands. We however lay in the ruins of a great past. Empty, ruined buildings are all that remain of old Layinret.

A prosperous city developed here, one that has been sought after by numerous kings.\n\nIn the late 1300s, Krekdekel was owned by Ketemcaka. The king of Ketemcaka at the time passed a series of edicts that angered the merchants and urbanites of Krekdekel greatly, such that they offered to swear fealty to Layinret in exchange for beneficial privileges. Layinret’s king accepted, and marched upon Krekdekel, taking the city without a fight. And although Ketemcaka would try to challenge this, Layinret’s armies beat back every attempt to retake Krekdekel.

Its armies plundered the countryside, seeking to fight a war of extermination, hoping to rid the land of the beast-squatters. Instead, the invasion turned into a disaster. The Averilibeti refused to face the Layinreti army head on, instead launching constant hit and run attacks. The entire countryside turned against Layinret, with even the bugs of the land spreading disease among Layinret’s ranks. After a year of campaigning, Layinret’s army returned home, accomplishing very little except bringing more corpses.\n\nOnly then did Averilibet’s army appear, and marched upon Layinret’s capital. The city had also mostly recovered from its razing 4 centuries prior, and now here it was facing another onslaught of shifter-warriors. And history repeated itself once more, Layinret falling to Averilibet, the city being systematically razed to the ground."

Before Layinret could fight its final stand, Kamniel himself intervened. He forced Averilibet and Layinret to negotiate an eternal peace treaty. Thus Layinret barely escaped from disaster once again, its freedom intact.\n\nBut the king of Layinret now had to start over from scratch, his capital in ruins, again. Instead of trying to rebuild for a second time, he moved his capital as far away from Averilibet. In Krekdekel would Layinret be reborn. When the king of Layinret was criticized by his advisors for doing this, he responded, “Do you want to see all that our ancestors have built be destroyed for a 3rd time? I am trying to save what remains, for I can see reality for what it is. It seems clear to me you can’t.”."

Seeking what was seen as a fading chance at glory, it was all too common in the fever of battle to see the finest gunners abandon their firearms for the honour of close claw-to-claw combat. Seeking to curtail this selfish and outmoded attitude, king Mitra established the Rakraz Tartashvyth Tsarat - the Royal Thundersteel School - to properly educate his soldiers on the usage and power of firearms. This drastically reduced the rate of this battle madness, while the foolish corpses of those seeking “glory” would be found wherever Yassa knew victory."

Having since exhausted all new avenues of wealth among their own kin, the avaricious king Aethron inevitably looked out to sea for new opportunities and found a reputation of cruelty and intolerance awaiting all lizardfolk.

When the Bhuvauri revolt freed those enslaved in the Kharunyana Delta, many of the Ofehibi chose not to remain in Rahen but instead to return to their homes.\n\nThis group  found themselves welcomed with open arms in Dakmender when they landed, and quickly established thesmelves as excellent contacts for dealings with the burgeoning Bhuvauri Republic.

All the while it has retained its importance as the heart of Melakmengi's trade with the outside world, and Dakmender is the only place in East Sarhal to rival the cities of Rahen in size or wealth.\n\nDespite its great wealth, however, Dakmender's independence has often been tenuous, and the kingdom's finances were overleveraged during the chaos of the late 1300s slave trade. These economic woes came to a head in 1421, when the Kingdom official defaulted on its debts to powerful merchant houses in Davharral. The merchants demanded payment in property and influence, and the settling of debts resulted in increasingly direct control of Dakmender by Davharral. The fallout of the acquisition of the kingdom by Davharral would lead to the many Raghamideshi invasions of Gebahiri, and see most of the coast conquered by the end of the 1430s."

While other states might be cautious about embracing foreign officers, Dakmender readily accepts those who have been prevented from rising through the ranks elsewhere. The wealth of the kingdom has allowed them to pay these officers well for their experience, and while not all are capable commanders, the promise of a haven for ambitious men is a strong draw for those throughout Melakmengi who find themselves without prospects."

As market demand for gulf pearls rose, the native oyster beds rapidly depleted, and the entire fishery risked total collapse. To counteract this, several conventions were called by the Jadd and Lorentish diplomats, but the great mercantile interests of the region were largely unable to agree on quotas, and enforcement of such measures was never able to completely stem the overfishing. Dakmender was one of the core markets for the oyster trade during this time, city officials asking few questions despite official policy, and it once more grew rich on the pearl trade that replaced much of the city's earilier slave economy."

A flood of adventurers and mercenaries descended on Amalik's holy land, demanding payment and looting wherever they could. One by one, the kingdoms to the west and south fell, and the Ofehibi's once-friends came to rule Gebahiri. But Boyebareti resisted, rallying the beleagured defenders, and bested Iyarashar at Tistrias pass, preventing an invasion of the east.

Centuries of skirmishes with these winged raiders, intermittent warfare with fellow Mengi, and the recent fights with Raghamideshi fleets have provided a wealth of experience in fighting against forces from land, air, and sea. Fortifications of the Kingdom of Boyebareti were thus built with defense from all directions in mind, with construction taking into account aerial countermeasures and naval invasions to ensure that no defensive position could be taken by surprise by an aerial or seaborn foe."

The Kings of Boyebareti consolidated their lands under the auspices of protecting the lesser chiefs and kings of the region from invasion, and they are ostensibly leaders of the League of Kings. Their legitimacy derived from their ability to defend the land from foreign invasion, and while this made them vulnerable in the face of foreign aggression, it was also a far more diplomatic government reform than that of their cantankerous mengi bretheren."

With such reinforced ships they pushed back two invasions launched by Sarkashabid, but the additional weight reduced the maneuverability, and the so-called Iron Fleet could not match the numbers and speed of the Bhuvauri Republican Navy when the Slave Republic invaded in 1512, an event that would mark the beginning of the end for the independent kings of Boyebareti."

Salik helped fund the reconstruction of the state house, including commissioning a giant version of this map to be painted on the back wall in the central hall.

In an attempt to combat the racial divide, Vyzemby History Day was introduced as a national holiday to celebrate the great history of the old Vyzemby civilization and its people.\n\nFor years the holiday was mocked as a patronising joke to the people of Fahvanosy.

This led to a cottage industry of forging documents claiming Khetist heritage. These “new” Khetist people were much more keen to embrace their supposed Khetist forefathers, erecting statues of Elikhet across their properties and dressing in traditional Khetist clothing.

Colloquially called the “Yellow Shukas” due to the colours of their traditional robes, their job was to travel across Horashesh to ensure Khetist laws and regulations were being upheld by local officials. That was their official position at least. In practice, they used baseless accusations of embezzlement and fraud to remove those from positions of power that the central government did not approve of. In their place they would appoint “upstanding citizens”, which in their case meant people more loyal to the Kartakhet rulers."

They moved into new lands, took control of the people who lived there, and either taught them to integrate into Kartakhet’s system or be driven ruthlessly from their homes. Do this enough times and you start to get very efficient at the process. Give Khetist settlers ownership rights to new lands, integrate those who already live there, and drive out resistance. One day you could be a farmer with a small plot of land in western Sarhal, and before you even knew there was a war, a statue of Elikhet would loom over your local market and an official bearing documents would inform you that your land was being leased to you by a foreign Khetist noble."

Every province has a governor, a temporary office appointed directly by the emperor, and in whose name the governor's rule. The governor in turn, ruled with an iron fist when needed.\n\nGovernors would be shifted and moved between provinces every 5 years, so as to make sure they never developed a solid powerbase of their own, from which they could challenge the emperor. Loyal governors would often be sent to the frontiers as promotions, given free reign to tax and extort the conquered as they saw fit.

An order composed entirely of planetouched was created, called the God’s Atoners, who were personally loyal to the emperor. All planetouched in Fangaula had to join this organization, or risk execution.\n\nThe duties of this order were three-fold: to regulate the planetouched, hunt down rogue planetouched, and to enforce the compliance of the provinces according to the emperor’s will."

The stone giants were used to build the fantastic city of Atijo Sigilan or "old throne" in our native language in a single night, sadly almost all gone now due to the ravages of time, the onslaught and war.\n\nAfter this feat Aro faced and passed the 10 tasks of royalty given to him by god and was able to drive back the foul lich Kaino and his gnoll allies.

All a village chieftain needed to do was pay the monthly tribute of goods to the local governor, and he had free reign to rule as he pleased in his tiny domain.\n\nDuring times of war however, this system would change. The tribute the chieftains had to send came in the form of warriors from their village. The "Tribute Of Arms" as referred to by the governors, while unpopular among the chieftains, were followed to the letter upon pain of death.\n\nThis mobilization system, while relatively simple, helped produce vast armies of warriors from all across Fangaula, which helped the empire achieve many victories upon the field of battle."

This is a land where those who are subservient know their place.\n\nSome still demand accountability from the emperor and his planetouched servants and moan about how we must ensure we don't make the same mistakes that previous "tyrants" made that led to the collapse of the second empire. These rebels will soon learn to love the taste of the imperial boot.\n\nIf they refuse to kneel then we shall beat them with ironwood rods until they kneel. If they refuse to give tribute to their master they will lose their hand that should have given us our fair share. If they dare give our emperor and his representatives the evil eye they shall be blinded with boiling water, with our emperor's two royal rams protecting him from the evil eye's effects. If they refuse to bend their head in worship of the empire they will lose their head full of disloyal thoughts of freedom."

The grandfather, named Melas, saw potential in the boy, and so taught young Akau in the ways of the sword.\n\nOne day, the local king coveted Akau’s mother, Amina, and sought to seize her by force. Akau, a mere 16 years old at the time, protected his mother, cutting off the king’s right hand in the process. It would not be long before the lesser king returned with a small army, intending to burn the village to the ground and kill Akau. And while the kingdid succeed in destroying the village, Amina would be burnt alive, with Akau only escaping due to the self-sacrifice of Melas, who fought off the king's army by himself.\n\nAkau would live his life from then-on as a sellsword and adventurer, slaying many beasts and foes alike, building up his strength and connections. And at the age of 36, he returned to his ruined home with an army of followers. He retook his village, avenged his mother and grandfather by killing the greedy king, and rebuilt the settlement, renaming it to Matamot “Mother’s Death”.\n\nWhile Matamot has grown into a proper city since that time, all Matamoti children are taught this tale.

Matamot slowly centralized and subverted the member cities of the alliance from the ground up. Matamoti agents could be found in every level of the member states, helping to control them without sparking alarm. As the pact became ever more centralized, the leadership of the other cities were greatly weakened, serving as mere puppets of the king of Matamot. And in 1533, a great ceremony was held, where the lord of Matamot was proclaimed the first king of the Pechuketema kingdom, the leadership of the other cities having been killed off the night before…”\n\n-An excerpt from the book “The Master Plan Of Matamot”, by Desta Alemayehu, 1862"

It would not be long before the king of Pechuketema set the guilds to work, producing small, mobile fire breathers.\n\nWhile many Dugiti would take these fire breathers and become mercenaries, many more would join special “fire breather” brigades set up by Pechuketema.

While few stand today, there is one remnant of that ancient kingdom in the center of Dugiti, a deep black, towering citadel. The city that bears the name “Dugiti” was built around this great citadel, after a local lord took over the abandoned structure, refurbished it, and made it his seat of power.\n\nEventually the citadel would be improved upon, and walls would be built around the settlement, yet the central structure remained crucial in Dugiti’s defense.

This problem is made worse among Mengi kingdoms, where violence and assassinations are common practice among the ruling classes.

This is due to the lords of Dugiti and their families taking up permanent residence in the ancient citadel, from which they are safe from the constant violence and bloodshed outside.\n\nFrom their position of safety, the lords of Dugiti deliberately inflame the violence between the guilds and estates, such that they are too busy killing each other to fight against the king. This gave the kings of Dugiti much leverage over those below them, which they used to centralize power over time."

Every single one of our top fighters challenged him, and all were defeated. Strangely, Shivaji had a habit of sparing those he defeated, and instead offered to train our warriors to use the special energy he harnessed, which he referred to as “Chi”.\n\nHe would move on from our city 5 years later, leaving behind a new tradition of Sarhaly chi cultivators in Manta, a tradition we practice to this day."

While he was nothing particularly special in combat, he had a keen tactical and strategic mind, such that he quickly rose through the ranks in our army. He impressed the king with his genius, and he was given the opportunity to lead an army of his own, in the upcoming campaign against the Simegasans.\n\nKajen performed brilliantly in the war, and although the campaign ended in a stalemate, he shined brightly.

The besiegers were forced to flee, a great victory having been dealt to the Simegasan aggressors.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the kings of the cities decided to continue their alliance, forging it in blood and ink, creating the Pechuketema Pact."

Unfortunately for the Sedarketemans, Mewomender horses were far faster than their own. Yet the Mewomender cavalry deliberately stayed within sight of their pursuers, as if they were taunting them. And soon, the Sedarketeman raiders were led into a forest, where they were ambushed by Mewomender warriors lying in wait…”\n\n-An excerpt from the book “Tales From East Sarhal”, by Jadu Uditanarayan Upendranayaran, 1756"

During this visit, a controversial abolitionist philosopher of Mengi-Raheni heritage named Jishan Sinda pressed Kamniel upon the topic of slavery. The following is an excerpt of that famous dialogue:\n\n“You claim to want to unite these lands, so that the darkness of the west will be destroyed, yet you ignore the darkness of our home? Should one not first cleanse their own body before cleaning another's? Why is it that you are so entirely focused on the vile hags, yet ignore the evils perpetuated by the kings daily?”\n\n“You misunderstand my intentions. I am purely concerned with the evil of the Yezel Mora not because it is the only evil, but because it is the most dangerous one in this world. Only with the extermination of the coven and its servants can the process of exterminating the evils of this world continue.”\n\n“Yet surely you can agree that this land is full of darkness, one that you have seemingly ignored. You have the power to end those vile institutions right now if you so chose, yet you let the slave-lords continue as they please, right in front of your eyes!”\n\n“My priority is the protection of this land, but that does not mean nothing can be done. I want to unify this land without violence and bloodshed inflicted upon its people, but that requires the cooperation of its noble kings, which forces me to look beyond…”\n\nThe angel Kamniel is said to have paused, and stuttered his words, before abruptly leaving. To many future Mengi abolitionists, this was the first sign of Kamniel's personal views changing on the topic of slavery."

The tactics of the Pechuketema cities would be incorporated into this new army, which focused on an all-volunteer professional military.

For this purpose, the early residents of Tsuz converted the town center into a large forge complex. The so-called 'Forge-Tower' was a looming construct. Each floor of the tower served a different purpose, at the top ore was melted into streams that flowed down. The second floor combined these streams into a flowing bronze river. The final floor was dedicated to smithing. The complex was able to out-produce the surrounding villages many times over. Even as Tsuzik was eclipsed by the northern iron mines and the town fell into poverty, more Towers were erected. By the 15th century, most of the city lay in decaying disarray.

With this method, the smiths could mass-produce cruder tools. While the city smiths continued to balk at it as an inferior practice, melt-smithing soon became the main medium by which a soldier's weapon was made.

However, over the centuries, through diplomacy, violence, and marriage, the family grew to become the most dominant of the Metobesebi, founding the kingdom of Teleksemayi.\n\nThe rulership style of Teleksemayi has been described as "two-faced" by many. To the common people, they are seen as great rulers, who bring peace and prosperity to their subjects. To those with any power and influence, like the family patriarchs, the ije Tikur-Beri are ruthless monsters. Every Metobesebi patriarch has been blackmailed in some form, forcing obedience."

They founded the Sedarketema federation, a true rival to the ije Tikur-Beri family's grip on power.\n\nFor decades the kingdom and the federation would fight constant battles. Teleksemayi referred to the Sedarketemans as rebels, and punished them accordingly. And in 1478, when Sedarketema was finally destroyed at the battle of Denkaret, Teleksemayi made sure to make an example. Every minor rebel holdout would be systematically destroyed, its defenders executed to the last.\n\nA statement was made that year, one no patriarch would ever forget.

A new capital was built into the mountainside of Leenshelok, the entire valley becoming a great city, full of people.

Utilizing its manpower advantage, and with support from Iyarhashar's rivals, Teleksemayi's armies marched eastwards in 1485.\n\nAt the battle of Tefgeben, the Teleksemayi and Iyarhashari armies clashed. The battle quickly turned into a stalemate, but due to a hidden flanking attack by Teleksemayi, the army of the Metobesebi emerged victorious. In the following years, the Iyarhashari would be kicked out of every holding they had on the mainland, and by 1489, they sailed away from East Sarhal, never to return. Teleksemayi had finally united the Metobesebi, a feat never achieved by any other."

Metobesebi philosophers sponsored by the king of Teleksemayi would emulate the ideology Vanrahar, modifying it to fit their purposes.\n\nTeleksemayi would lean heavily upon Metobesebi nationalism, proclaiming the state itself as one massive family. In accordance with this policy, the state worked to destroy the old family structures and their patriarchs.

To this end we have created a system where this will never occur.\n\nThe leader of Sedarketema is the hegemon, a man chosen from among the high ranks of the army by the patriarchs. The hegemon must never be a patriarch himself, and no family should have one of their own serve as hegemon twice in a row. In turn, for the sake of the unity and stability of Sedarketema, the hegemon shall not show favoritism towards his own family.\n\nThis system led to Sedarketema having far more stable politics than other Mengi kingdoms, while at the same time avoiding the tyranny found in Sedarketema's rival.

In Walagnet rests a great hillfort, its thick stone walls and large garrison a barrier to any advance by Teleksemayi southwards.\n\nEventually, Teleksemayi sent an army to take the fortress. It held for a year, long enough for our army to arrive and force the besiegers to flee.\n\nThe defense of Walagnet proved the superiority of large defensive strongpoints, instead of small wooden forts Sedarketema had been building up to this point.

Even the legendary Walagnet fell in the end, Sedarketema’s power dwindling. And with the Raheni cutting off their life line, they knew the end was near. In 1478, Sedarketema was pushed to Denkaret, the last stronghold of the free Metobesebi. Every available man, old or young, gathered in a suicide army of 8,000. The king of Teleksemayi had arrived with his much larger host, prepared to exterminate the defenders and their families to the last.\n\nThe final army of Sedarketema hid behind their final hillfort, prepared to fight to the end. They fought on the walls, they fought in the courtyard, they fought in the keep, they fought in the watchtowers, they fought in the barracks. They never surrendered. They were eradicated.\n\nThe cost Teleksemayi paid was enormous, as the Sedarketemans killed 2 men for every 1 they lost. And while Teleksemayi entered the battle with 20,000, it left Denkaret with only half still standing. The defenders, exterminated to the last, became martyrs. They along with Sedarketema itself became symbols to future Metobesebi on the better path their people could have taken, rather than the tyrannical Teleksemayi."

Soon these scholars soon found themselves in an unusual alliance of hunters, Deathsworn, and shamans, becoming the faction of the “Swamp Wardenship.” Swamp-Wardens became experts of the terrain with a scientific understanding of the Swamps.\n\nBy 1444, The Swamp-Wardens currently rule Yemotafari. Ruling with a fair meritocratic system of governance. So far, they have returned the egalitarian status quo lost during the “Great Shame.” Despite this, their actions during and after Tamrat’s fall are still seen with contention with some, even those who disapproved of the tyrant’s actions disliked their method.

However it took an accidental mass poisoning in 1446 from a deadly mushroom (easily confusable and almost identical to a far more edible truffle) that the Wardenship had to finally untangle this mess of knowledge. \n\nLater that year, the Wardenship’s Sect of Scribes based in Kadmuduuk was formed to gather the swamp of studies into a coherent catalog. It was an exhausting effort, the Scribes sifted through hundreds of studies, some contradictory, some outdated, some right and wrong, a few completely gone or completely incoherent and had to be rewritten. But by 1449, the “Index of Kadmuduuk” was completed, and was an immediate source of importance to the Wardenship, enforcing the text on newer recruits.

This dispersal of peoples and beliefs within all areas of their cities has resulted in a melting pot of different cultures, religions and beliefs."

Over time this tendency has grown to such an extent that they now maintain much of this underground network independently of the traders. This separation has allowed them to infiltrate deeper into their enemies' bureaucracies. This has been particularly useful for sabotage and for hindering their neighbors invasion plans. After all, it is difficult to fight a war when your own people are in open revolt."

These ships carry goods from all across Sarhal and Haless to the market houses which have been built into docks themselves. This combined with many large cranes allow for the fastest and most efficient flow of goods into and out of the city.

In response to both this ever-growing threat and the ascension of the Jaddari Legions in the West, the Sarkhashabid ruling class began investing heavily into new military innovations in an attempt to maintain the status quo. These investments would pave the way for the introduction of cannons into the Raghamideshi fleets and armies.

This allowed the people of those lands greater autonomy over certain aspects of their lives, such as culture and faith. This vastly improved the happiness of the people in those lands and paved the way for the creation of the Sarkhashabid Bureau of Overseas Subjects in 1462, established with the intention of moving beyond their colonial holdings by incorporating those new lands as semi-autonomous subject states beneath the crown."

The soils of the area are also red in many places due to the high content of iron oxides within. These iron rich soils would later be the first sign of the vast deposits of iron ores beneath the hills of Shenral. \n\nMany, however, have come to have a different reason for calling it “red”. There are many who call it the “red” paradise not because of its soils or flora, but because of how frequently blood has been spilt upon the hills of Shenral -be they from would-be conquerors and their armies, or from rebellious lords seeking to overthrow the status quo.

It is long believed that the land north of the lakes would be doomed to chaos, as this was the thirtieth tribe to exist on this specific land in four centuries. However Bemnet was willing to challenge this notion. He was no warrior, but he was a master of the word. \n\nBemnet revealed his silver tongue and in one meeting, brought the lords in line, blackmailing the strongest lord into submission. While the lords debated for who becomes the next chief, Bemnet received word that Kidsit Yitsi was preparing an invasion on kadamuu. He traveled to their capital with his envoys to persuade them out of war; he succeeded (but made a secret deal known only to Bemnet and the king of Kidsit). \n\nEventually, Bemnet is named the new chieftain of kadamuu by the lords, bestowed with the surname of kali-shemane, or “the Word Weaver.” His family have ruled the tribe ever since and have since practiced and celebrated the art of the tongue."

Second, the capital they built was the legendary lakeside city of Mertaphala, supposedly the largest the Sinewosi ever made. It was the beating heart of the Sinewosi, a trading center, and its close proximity to the salt mines made this city of eighty-thousand valuable. \n\nBut the third thing known about Tnismengi was its unexpected and horrifying destruction. In 952, a large raiding party of Swamp Trolls sneaked into the city and completely razed Mertaphala to the ground. They stormed the palace, wiped out the ruling family, and stole anything and everything they could, including their favorite food: humans. Before the sunset, Mertaphala was a city of stone; by the sunrise, hollowed ruins beyond rep.\n\nSurvivors left Mertaphala and settled across the hinterlands of the quickly fracturing Mertamengi. Among these new settlements is kadamuu. Four centuries and twenty-nine tribes later, kadamuu has emerged as the most possible successor of this long dead kingdom.

The kingdom was plagued with a great factional rivalry, between the mages and nobles on one side, and the wealthy merchant clans on the other. The kings sought to keep the two factions in balance, but it would eventually break at some point. And it came in the 1420s, when king Aberash III, the true and only legitimate king of Meretgeban, came to power. The merchant clans, angered, rose a wealthy commoner to the position of king, tearing Meretgeban apart in bloody strife.\n\nEventually, the legitimate side was forced to flee to Wezinmesig, the corrupt merchants now having a puppet in Meretgeban. Although Aberash III and his allies had lost the battle, they were not out of the fight, and bid his time, waiting for the perfect chance to march southwards and retake his rightful throne."

 S59_azmera_the_unbreakable_desc: "In the 1200s, a young mage in his 20s named Azmera left Meretgeban, traveling upstream to build a mage tower for himself. In this tower he researched and improved upon his magic, becoming the foremost expert in abjuration and transmutation magic in East Sarhal. In time, a settlement grew around his tower, as his feats became famous across Amilak's land. This settlement prospered even after Azmera's demise, becoming known as Wezinmesig, the river tower.\n\nWhile Azmera accomplished many legendary feats in his day, there is one that stands above the rest in its usefulness. He invented a method by which cloth can easily be abjurated, becoming as hard as metal, negating the need for heavy iron armor. This abjurated cloth would quickly become mass produced in Wezinmesig, as the method was refined so that even apprentice mages could do it.\n\nWhile the method would spread to other cities over time, only in Wezinmesig is the highest quality warded fabrics produced, made exclusively for our soldiers to use in battle."

What was assumed to be a tactical retreat turned into a long exile. The old order of Meretgeban was forced to build an entirely new kingdom of Wezinmesig, a kingdom known as Wezingoa. This new kingdom still claimed to be the rightful rulers of Meretgeban, yet in daily life the reality was clear. This was a new kingdom now, heavily influenced by the mages of its capital. Consequently, Aberash tempered his ambitions, focusing less on returning to Meretgeban, and more on patronizing the research into magic itself."

In 1459, Kamniel came to the city to meet with its king. During this visit, the angel let the mages and scholars perform numerous tests and interviews with him. The information gained from this was invaluable, and gave a rare glimpse into the world of the divine.\n\nWhat they found was this: angels are made of pure light, they do not bleed, light emerges from any wound they receive, they have their own emotions and feelings, they are fundamentally good beings, but their morality is strange to mortals. The information gained from Wezingoa, along with the later discoveries by the Ravelians centuries later, would form the foundation of understanding of celestials as a whole."

This system rewarded mages that did great deeds for the state, where they would be elevated to the rank of nobility. This made the mages more loyal to us, and more importantly, much more willing to work hard for our interests."

But with Werikgeta’s destruction in 1472, it was clear that Wezingoa’s time had finally come. The old king, Aberash III, and his advisors, hatched a daring plan, made specifically for a scenario such as this. They would negotiate with Meretgeban before their armies arrived, and call upon Kamniel to aid them.\n\nWith the divine being on Wezingoa’s side, the old king negotiated the best deal he possibly could have gotten, where Wezingoa would be peacefully annexed into Meretgeban, but with no retribution being taken against the mages, the lesser-kings, or anyone else. Crucially, the ije Birra-Bonsa would remain untouched, only having to give up their claim to the throne of Meretgeban permanently.\n\nThus the Treaty of Kwariketem was signed, finally re-unifying the old kingdom of Meretgeban. Aberash and his family would then retire to the countryside, becoming a prominent clan of mages in the centuries to come."

As such they employ well-made bronze shields reinforced with hardened wood, which they align in tight formations, skillfully holding off any charges from the undisciplined rabbles of the jungle. The ije Devhane-Owe dynasty came to be known as  “The Woodchopper Kings'' due to the Glenslaughter, a battle in which a Sitewosi army ambushed King Tesfaye I ije Devhane-Owe at an inspection of a recently initiated jungle clearing, where he and his royal guard had joined in at cutting trees as a symbol of support to the foresters. At first, the King’s soldiers were driven back as they attempted to get to their armour and weapons, unable to form their tight ranks without their shields, but Tesfaye I rallied the woodcutters to fight, cutting at limbs as surely and swiftly as they did at branches. The ambush force was halted and the royal guard swept in to corral the disheartened Sitewosi warriors, chasing them into the newly made clearings and skewering them on their long spears. Since then a portion of the King’s Guard is chosen among the woodcutters and armed with axes, on top of the usual spear.

An issue with this was the Sitewosi; while they paid tribute quite willingly once subjugated, their kingdoms were not long-lived. Every decade a few new tribal kings would topple the old loyal ones, just to raid the borders of the Great Kingdom once more. Though this was lessened by the establishment of true Sitewosi vassal kingdoms in the area, it became clear to Owe III that he must use a firmer hand with the jungle. For this purpose, the Kingdom of Ketemcaka was founded. The city of Ketemcakan was granted to Taridas, a lesser king from Zusedar. All the kings and lesser kings of Great Fetengoni, as well as all the tributary kings of Owe III, were invited to the city to witness Taridas I ije Devhane-Owe’s crowning. Despite the propping up of a lesser king to king being rather untraditional, the prestige of Great Fetengoni and the presence and approval of so many Kings at his coronation made Taridas’s dynasty one of the most legitimate of the Mengi, respected even among the great houses of the Yeteferen."

It is no wonder why the kings of Ketemcaka keep a well-manned guard around them at all times, as on multiple occasions ambushes come upon them from the jungle - sometimes even from our own Sitewosi subjects. \n\nOnce we tried to include Sitewosi in our army as the kings of Ibekisedara proudly do, but this practice led to chaos among our troops as the wild unscrupulousness of the tribesmen wore at the discipline of our ranks. While an inefficient and unpopular policy, it was still maintained in the belief that the savages through Amilak’s light would eventually civilise. This foolish dream of trust came to an end with the assassination of Taridas II by a presumed-honourable Sitewosi of his own royal guard. While our neighbours consider them honourable fellow-residents of the Holy Land, we know better. Even the most respectable-seeming or kind Sitewosi hides a dagger behind his back. The only Mengi we can trust to fight for our king is a Yeteferen!"

As such the Wood-Chopper Kings developed a method through the use of fire.While considered dangerous by some and a waste of wood by others this simply couldn’t be further from the truth. The method is simple in theory: cut down the trees around an area, creating a border to what forest one wishes to burn and keeping the fire from spreading out of control, and when it is burned, place regular patrols to keep watch over the borders and ensure the fire is contained. For additional safety, burnings are forbidden except in the month before the end of the dry season and the start of the wet, so even if a mistake is made and the fire leaps across its boundary the rains are not too far away to quench it before it can do too much damage. With this method the Ketemcakans were able to rapidly expand our farmlands more and more. At this rate one day they shall produce more grain than the fields of Shelokmengi itself."

Over time, however, it became clear this was making us unprepared and short-sighted, a prime target for Sitewosi raiders. Thus Taridas I concluded his army must learn the ways of the jungle to make sure no Sitewosi could unwittingly cross our borders. While the Sitewosi were still trusted, it was they who taught jungle warfare and logistics to the soldiers; their banishment from the military did not mean the banishment of the tactics and survival skills they shared with us. It is no surprise that when such logistics skills are incorporated into an actually well-coordinated army, they end up being much more potent than in a tribal rabble."

But for centuries the eastern jungle was under the rule of the Prosperous, with Sitewosi kings like those of Saposakosa adopting their ways and straying from local traditions. Not forever though, in 1412 the Lesser King Lishan I who served under the King of Saposakosa declared a surprising war of conquest against Ketemcaka, without the order or approval of his liege. Even more surprisingly Lishan defeated the armies of the Wood-Chopper Kings in a gruelling war, earning him the name “Rifan-Afu”, the Dread Fang, for the brutality of his soldiers and the acts they committed unto their fellow servants of the One True God.

Lishan I created a system of speaking in his army, whereby information was delivered based on importance and listed in colour. Colours ranged from green, being common knowledge one may speak to civilians, to crimson red that was only allowed to be heard by the ears of the king himself. The most well-known colour was light blue, orders that could be heard by anyone of higher rank than a common warrior. The colour became infamous in the army, as many a footsoldier who overheard such a message, accidentally or otherwise, was promptly executed, giving birth to the nickname Bloody Blue.

In sync, the Dread Fang and his generals raided and warred along the jungle border, with their swift manoeuvring leaving the Ibekisedaran forces unable to arrive in time to stop the offensive. Over time, the opposing forces became more and more spread out trying to predict where the Bosonkikoni army would strike. Despite the experience of Getametaki’s armies they were reduced to confused kittens lunging at spots of sunlight reflected off our blades.

Outsiders hired us as guides and the Tamajoba even invaded the jungle to subjugate our people for their skills.\n\nNow the jungle is ours and ours alone. Now we use Kanhati’s wisdom only for ourselves. As we have come to accept the Dao Nako as our true home, the desire has emerged to see it bloom as never before.

But when the skies turned dark and monsters emerged around us we each scattered our separate ways. Banni freed all the Kaino and led all the Kaino, knowing that we needed to depend on each other to be safe from the would-be tyrants of these lands. But when the remaining imperial planetouched murdered him, we gave up on his dream instead of taking responsibility for achieving it ourselves. Those times are behind us now, however we must always remember these events and never allow ourselves to be broken again.\n\nOnce four, now we are one. Whatever fate may have in store for us, we face it together."

 B69_grey_grey_mist_of_home_desc:0 "Over rolling hills and across meandering streams, an ever-present grey mist shrouds Crovania. In other lands, this would be considered an omen or warning, but for us, it is a simple fact of life. Farmers toil and merchants haggle, unbothered by the blurred horizons and dappled light during daytime. At night, a common saying in Crovania holds that hard workers “sleep in the mist's embrace” - peacefully and without a care. Why worry about anything beyond your own field if you can't see it in the first place?\n\nMany who visit Crovania are unsettled by the mist and leave as quickly as they arrive. They spread rumours of ghostly figures hidden in the gloom and scoff at our simple lifestyles, discouraging many a traveller. This suits us just fine. Each mist-wreathed village and town is a placid land of hardy folk, left mostly untouched by the squabbles of greater Cannor. Where other holdings suffer under tyrannical nobles, we enjoy a great degree of autonomy and freedom. The nobles enjoy passing their time around the village and participating in chat and parties with commoners. In Crovania, everyone is cut from the same misty cloth. Some may call our lands strange and steer away from the fog. For us, though, it's home."

 B69_adean_guides_us_desc:0 "While the Crovanians aren’t horsemen like the Entebic peoples or the chivalric men of Escann, they have followed Adean in a more humble and simplistic manner, believing that putting honesty and effort into their work will bring blessings as a reward. The classic symbol of the Crovanian peoples is that of Adean’s hand holding a spear.\n\nCrovan Spearsworn was the first to bring the worship of Adean not only to Crovania but to Lencenor as a whole. The ancient Crovanni people followed his lead, and with Adean guiding Crovan, they were able to find a safe land and establish a secure community in Crovan’s Rest. Thus, the origins of an Adeanic Crovania came forth, and the people have had an affinity for the god ever since. The people are generous and kind, and the nobles are honourable and clean of corruption, working day and night to prosper. These are lessons ingrained in the Crovanians from the day they were born until now, all thanks to Adean."

 B69_the_right_hand_army_desc:0 "The Crovanian army has never been the strongest in Lencenor. The nearby duchies of Rubenaire, Enteben, and Deranne eclipsed the small Crovanian force. When they fought alongside the Moon Party during the Lilac Wars, though, they proved their worth. As opposing Silmuna-aligned and Lorentish armies met in battle, the Crovanians became a necessary component to fight off the Lorentish coalition. A disciplined and unwavering force in a sea of crashing waves.\n\nThe reason for such valiance is the same reason the Crovanians stayed humble: Adean. By fighting in battle with all they could, the men of Crovania believed that they would be blessed by their patron and could live their lives happily.\n\nThus, the morale of the Crovanians remained high all throughout the war. They fought in the battles of Kyliande and Greatfield, and eventually witnessed the Derannic surrender in Rosereach in 1439. Deprived of allies, the Crovanians strained themselves to stand as firm as they could. They would cry their final hurrah as their armies were wiped out in the battle of Crovan’s Rest. By 1440, the Crovanians would surrender to their fate, and they would be annexed by the Lorentish crown."

 B69_stalwart_traders_desc:0 "Venaíl was never vastly inhabited until the elves came around and settled the island.\n\nThe mist that lies on the Shrouded Coast proved to be a heavy barrier. For centuries, nobody has dared venture into the cursed fog. Rumours abound of monsters and eldritch beings that lurk around the coast, that grab onto people and then drag them to the depths of the waters to feast. The fact that the mist became so thick sometimes that it was impossible to see a lighthouse; these tales don’t tempt explorers to venture around these waters when there are far more interesting things to explore.\n\nThe Crovanians thus had the Shrouded Coast all for themselves. They enjoyed full control of this seaway, as it allowed the few Crovanian traders that existed to outcompete their competition in Lorent and Sorncóst, even with their tiny numbers. Their willingness to explore and memorise the Shrouded Coast gave them navigational knowledge like no other.\n\nThe Crovanian traders banded together to form the Crovanian Trade Company, which dominated trade around the Shrouded Coast and transported goods no matter the dangers. This pioneer spirit led to them expanding to the far reaches of the Dalaire, transporting goods to and from Aelantir."

 B69_haunting_at_medron_hall_desc:0 "The old Countess Griselda, of the ancient house of Medrontis, ruled the lands of Mistspear, and her young nephew Drunhem in Crovan’s Rest remained nearby. After the death of Triandil Medrontis with no suitable replacement from House Medrontis, his close friend Belan was given regency over New Adea until a suitable replacement from House Medrontis could be found.\n\nUnfortunately for Belan, the old lady Griselda, mother of Triandil and ruler of nearby Mistspear, heard a different story. As a young mage, she studied all the magics profusely, believing that they had spoken to her. While it may have just been a gut instinct at first, in her old age she truly acted as if the magics were alive and talking. In her slumber, she heard voices screaming cries of assassination.\n\nEventually, Griselda invited her young nephew Drunhem, Belan and the rest of House Medrontis to a meeting. Nothing seemed different from any of the previous occasions on which House Medrontis had convened. It was one of Griselda’s nieces who noticed she was noticeably different that evening. Her face was tired; her eyes were bloodshot, and her pupils in a blur. As the family gathered around the dinner table, Griselda stood to give a toast for the wonderful evening. She talked for what seemed like an age until, abruptly, she stopped. A tear came to her eye as she spoke of her son and his brutal assassination. Nobody knew what she was talking about, as Drunhem and Belan sat watching in fearful paralysis. Griselda continued, her voice becoming hoarse and her tears flowing. She shouted and screamed until finally she turned and yelled:\n\n“You Belan, you took my son from me! He is dead because of your greed! My own nephew, Drunhem, helped him! And all of you did as well! You are all pigs and devils and demons! You will all be damned!”\n\nThe night was still young, as Medron Hall went dark. The locals simply thought they had gone to sleep, as the butlers ran out in horror at what they saw."

 B69_crovanian_what_desc:0 "Crovania never had a special wine to sell or even a notable trade good within our lands. The people sold fish, horses, and crops. The fields were unproductive, and the people were poor.\n\nThis was true until the elves would come to settle in Crovanian territory. They saw the calm lands and immediately brought their peoples in caravans to settle along the Shrouded Coast. Many were surprised at the vast number of elves travelling to settle in their isolated fields. The Crovanians were intrigued by the incoming elves and their culture. They treated their new neighbours as friends and provided them with food and new homes. It took very little time for the elves and Crovanians to mix into one.\n\n Whilst well-appreciated by the Crovanians, the most notable thing they brought wasn’t their culture or their wealth; it was their silk. Shops appeared across Crovan’s Rest, and eventually even large-scale companies. Crovania would become notorious for its elven silk, which gave it a soft feel unlike any other. Thus, Crovan’s Rest became a valuable hub for the silk market, and Crovania soon became invaluable to their wine-loving brethren."

 B69_the_crovanian_cannons_desc:0 "Cannons were something that the Crovanians under Lorent cared little about. They had never properly devoted any of their resources to producing weapons and gear for war. What was the need if they were so distant from conflict?\n\nYet, as the lands grew older and old rocks eroded, an opportunity came about. An iron mine was found in Mistspear, and nearby, a copper mine.\n\nThus, the era of the Crovanian Cannons began, as high-quality cannons were shipped out locally and regionally. Mistspear, which had once been a backwater, suddenly got rid of its run-down infrastructure and prospered from the new income surrounding the mining and forging community and the production of their cannons. They were known for their firing power, which allowed them to reach long distances with ease.\n\nAll of this gave the Crovanians a new outlet for their tiny local guard, the Lorentish major army, and any other possible buyers. Their few numbers could now be happy, economically and militarily secured by high-quality Crovanian cannons."

In every wave that breaks upon Khurgas shores, there is a promise, a reaffirmation of an age-old pact between coastal lizardfolk and the Araizary.\n\nAs the great winds cause the night sky's change, so too does the devotion to the Araizary shift and evolve. Among the most revered is Yusshela, the celestial dolphin, whose constellation shimmers with a unique brilliance. Every year, as Yusshela's image reaches its zenith, the Festival of the Favoured Waves begins. Nobles, merchants, and common folk alike gather in a grand feast, a portion of their annual earnings offered to the holy waters in exchange for Yusshela's favour.

Once a pivotal cog in the economic powerhouse of an empire, the nation found itself without the steady hand of stately administration - it could cut the shape of its sails and steer toward a new purpose.\n\nYet through all the upheaval, Khugra bore the scars of abandonment proudly - an empire's legacy manifest in their architecture, their customs, their heritage - a reminder of the past and a symbol of hard-earned sovereignty."

A network of subterranean aqueducts channel water directly into dry docks, allowing shipwrights to float heavy ship components into position, rather than laboriously hauling them by brute force. This makes Khugras heavy ships some of the cheapest to construct in all of Sarhal."

We must head north, seize the Mandate of the Khet, then push to the East until there is no more east left to push into. In this manner, Aakhet's name and Aramoole's glory will be engraved upon the minds of all races on Halann!"

 L08_peace_between_houses_desc: "When Kheterata ruled over Horashesh, they split our homeland into Medasi - regions to be ruled over by a Kheteratan governor working in tandem with a local monarch. Other Medasi have descended into petty conflicts, fighting each other for influence until the quaggas come home and the sun falls out of the sky. Kulugiash has historically been more prudent. Both Kheteratans and the native houses of Kulugiash knew the merits of coming together to obtain goals. While others bleed each other white, we put aside our differences and preserved peace between houses. It would take something extraordinary to break this harmony between our people…"

Carefully raised and bred by mages, it is the absolute pinnacle of its species, unmatched in bravery and unparalleled in its stoicism.

When Kheterata suffered from a crisis, Kulugiash would suffer too, being bled dry of its men for the sake of the Kingdom. But that time is past. Kheterata has lost her grip over us and our armed forces shall serve for our purposes alone."

Though dominions may rise and fall and powers appear and disappear, the greatness of Ikhanilawuli shines forth like a torch against the unrestrained folly that surrounds us. We will not forsake our great deity — never!"

These divisions in our nation cannot last forever. But, at least for now, we have ways to quell these dissidents."

However, under the leadership of Esi ‘the Gunman’, a general in the Kulugiash army with a radical approach to military reform, the Kulugiash military was equipped with firearms purchased from Cannorian traders. At the Battle of Shen Yunas, it is said not a single Kuiika warrior reached the Kulugiash battlelines, with every single one being struck down by musket fire."

The lake graces us with as much water as we could possibly need for agriculture. But that is not all: great Lasadza holds many unique species of fish, and other diverse aquatic life. Small wonder, then, that we have as much produce as we do."

 L69_rushdown_tactics_desc: "Armaments and soldiers are all well and good in their own way but they become worthless if they cannot move from one place to the next within their homeland quickly. Fortunately for us, years of fighting for control over Zerat and its surroundings have enabled us to develop what are called 'rushdown tactics'. Zerat forces maneuver quickly through our home terrain, which every soldier must know like the back of their hand, and disappear as quickly as they appear, leaving defeated armies in their wake."
 L69_centralization_reforms: "Centralization Reforms"
 L69_centralization_reforms_desc: "For ages, we were governed by a relatively decentralized system—our ruler devolved power upon vassals, and those vassals governed in the ruler's name, handing produce, tax, and soldiers back to the central government. That persisted until a minister, named after the great Chief Ptolek, realized that holding to this system could only lead to opportunism and rebellion. Thus he, in proper devotion to Zerat and our serene dynasty, convinced his liege to centralise the realm. The result was the Ptolekas Reforms; thanks to them, all power in Zerat is now centralised upon the ruler, and the vassals serve only at their liege's pleasure."

Time was that we ruled all of our kind; though we lost that power for a time, Zerat still stands proud among its scaled peers today. But let the world take note: it is only a matter of time before we are made ruler of all lizardfolk again, until the 332nd Empire dies and the 333rd Empire rises. When that time comes, Halann will know and take note: our ruler will no longer be a mere 'king' or 'chieftain', but an Antsakirak—a god-emperor!"

With the empire’s collapse and the ensuing centuries of foreign raids and economic decline, the once-grand city has fallen far from its glory days, now little more than a fortified town squatting in the deserted ruins of one of ancient Sarhal’s largest cities. Once the seat of power for continental empires, now Shalazari rule extends only over a handful of cities and a single vassal-tribe. However, the lakeside land remains rich and fertile, and the empty stone buildings and old farming terraces that cover the hillsides make it easy to expand the current settlement."

For millennia Lizardfolk across Taneyas have made pilgrimage to this sacred temple, but now it also sees visitors of a different kind: five centuries ago, Raktaya Ashaktiz renovated the eastern hall with the petrified skeletons of enormous fish and reptiles unearthed in a slate quarry in Ashakani, and now the temple attracts fascinated naturalists from Kheterata to Baashidi!"

Given our ancient history and grand priesthood, our citizenry are also amongst the most fervent believers in the ancient tenets of Anzalkatsa: that 332 times has Taneyas been united and divided, and an immortal empire will be the one to unite our land for a final 333rd time. Every citizen of Shalazar holds this story in their heart, and they show a willingness without peer to enlist and take up arms to ensure that it is glorious Shalazar that will claim the 333rd thone, and lead all of Taneyas to an eternal place in the sun."

There is clear potential to apply this technique on a larger scale."

While some would question the value of training those who might never manage more than a handful of spells, many of these lizardfolk go on to labor in our city's countless workshops and provide us with an ample supply of enchanted weaponry and ammunition. From fire-charmed polearms to cursed knives, combat against a Shalazari infantry regiment is normally a surprising and painful experience."

 L84_abundant_priesthood_desc: "Already situated at the edge of Taneyas, the emergence of the Ashhama from Yezel Mora a millennia ago and their abandonment the Scaled Gods’ teachings left Lizardfolk in Odu Kherass isolated from other followers of Anzalkatsa. Fortunately, we have long been blessed with an abundance of Naga as a reward for our faith, and now as we expand our territory, our well-staffed priesthood allows us to place shrines and attendant Naga in every newly conquered township. With so many Naga, we can efficiently bring the guidance – and the control – of our faith to newly conquered humans and wayward Ashhama alike."

The old imperial roads, rebuilt and broadened, have extended to encompass the new cities that dot the hills and lowland jungles, carrying soldiers and travellers, communication and commerce.

 S15_the_crater_city_of_karshyr_desc: "When Karshyr was first built, it was contained entirely within the half-collapsed crater of an extinct volcano, but as the city expanded to become one of the Anzara Empire's largest, the crater-city was designated to be a palace and temple complex, while the rest of the city's functions were relocated beyond the crater. Being surrounded on all sides either by volcano walls or steep cliffs facing the ocean, the inner city's lack of space and near inaccessibility, save for a narrow mountainside path, meant that Karshyr had to employ various advanced architectural methods and urban planning techniques to make the most out of inner city’s available space, which translated over to other Karshyray settlements."
 S15_vyzemby_ties: "Vyzemby Ties"
 S15_vyzemby_ties_desc: "The Karshyray Lizardfolk are among the few Lizardfolk who maintain cordial relations with the Vyzemby, which is rooted in their mutual seafaring lifestyle, shared distaste of Karassk due to their subjugation under the Karasskas Empire, and trade ties maintained by their Lizardfolk brethren living in the Fahvanosy. Most of these Lizardfolk in fact descend from independent-minded Karshyray who left to make a new life away from Karasskay oppression.\n\nKarshyr's long trade-ties with the Vyzemby has invariably made them the main trade link between the Lizardfolk and Vyzemby, and has left a legacy of open-mindedness towards foreigners and their ideas in the Rankaty Islands. This led to Karshyr being the first Lizardfolk nation to establish trade and diplomatic ties with Cannorian nations, and adopting new institutions and technologies from them."
 S15_mausoleum_of_the_venerable: "Mausoleum Of The Venerable"
 S15_mausoleum_of_the_venerable_desc: "At the heart of Karshyr lies the Mausoleum of the Venerable: a colossal temple complex dating back to the times of the Anzara Empire, which serves as the resting place of many of Karshyr's and the Karasskay Empire's greatest leaders, mages and priests. Famous for the fabulous wealth and ancestral treasures its crypts contain, it's also a target for foreign thieves and adventurers to plunder. As a result, the Grave Wardens, crater-city's caretakers and ceremonial guardians, have taken to patrolling the outer layers of the temple, while filling its inner sanctums with traps and monsters in an effort to protect the monument from any potential looters."
 S15_the_anonymous_of_karshyr: "The Anonymous Of Karshyr"
 S15_the_anonymous_of_karshyr_desc: "A Karshyray hydromancer and chronicler from the times of the Anzara Empire, who wrote the oldest surviving book about Lizardfolk history. Despite how little is known of him, the meticulous detail he put into his research and writing not only preserved much information that is otherwise lost, but the historical methods he employed were unparalleled until contemporary times and played a noteworthy role in ending the Cannorians' perception of the Lizardfolk as a monstrous race, making him a highly respected figure in Karshyr."
 S15_hydromancers_guild: "Hydromancer's Guild"
 S15_hydromancers_guild_desc: "Karshyr once rivaled Karassk for the mastery of the seas, which was reflected in the city once having been the centre of the Anzara Empire's hydromancers. Even today, the Hydromancers' Guild plays an important role in Karshyr's society - calming the seas for sea-travel, summoning rains for agriculture, operating the underwater seaweed plantations, and utilising hydromancy in dye-making processes at the Dye-works. As a result of the wealth and stability the mages bring to the islands, they're a deeply influential and respected actor in the daily life of Karshyray citizens."
 S15_mystics_of_the_third_eye: "Mystics Of The Third Eye"
 S15_mystics_of_the_third_eye_desc: "The “three-eyed ones” are a rare strain of Lizardfolk most common in the Rankaty Islands, who are born with a unique organ called 'the Third Eye' on their forehead. The Third Eye allows these Lizardfolk to perform various magical feats, like sense the magical power in their surroundings, communicate telepathically, read and control minds, extend their lifespan, and even fuse their soul with the third eye, turning it into a pearl-like crystal that retains their consciousness after death.\n\nThe Three-Eyed Lizardfolk once worked under the Naga, but for unknown reasons, no Nagas have been born in the Rankaty Islands since the Day of Ashen Skies, which also led to more Three-Eyed Lizardfolk being born. As a result, Mystics of the Third Eye have compensated for their niche to become the magical and spiritual leaders of Karshyr, making them greatly valued and respected among the islanders."
 S15_aquaculture_pioneers: "Aquaculture Pioneers"
 S15_aquaculture_pioneers_desc: "The Rankaty Islands' waters are rich with marine life, but the most economically significant of them are the various species of seaweeds, which are used for dye production to such an extent that underwater plantations were created to fuel the ever-increasing demand for the Karshyray seaweed dyes. While Karshyr has remained the biggest dye producer in the Lizardfolk lands, it was held back by most of its dye-works and underwater plantations having been destroyed during the Day of Ashen Skies. Their reconstruction resulted in a massive increase in dye production, but also revealed several inefficiencies in the ancient farming methods, which could be amended with modern technologies. Over time, the studies in aquaculture led to Karshyr pioneering aquacultural advancements that expanded beyond algae farms - underwater fish farms would come to raise various animals, from milkfish and shrimps to lobsters, pearl oysters and even the fearsome dragonfish."

Regardless of species, age, or creed, all are welcome at the communal stargazing nights, where tribe and visitor alike succumb to the hypnotic pull of astral bodies strewn across the black expanse.\n\nEncircling a tender bonfire, naga and ruler join in the recounting of tribal and spiritual history - of lizards, love and loss. It is said that to shed a tear at such an event is to be Ishalanas, for the practice mirrors the very essence of the tribe's name: 'To gaze upon the stars with sorrowful eyes.'"
 S14_diplomatic_grove: "Diplomatic Grove"
 S14_diplomatic_grove_desc: "In Naga ra Atsla, the wind whispers an age-old tale. A story of twin tribal princes, Ix and Qoz, each hungry for a promised inheritance. An ownership dispute stewed between them, focused on a grove of serpentine trees from which the region gets its name. Ix, the elder, staked his claim based on the precedence of birth, measured not in mere minutes but the ceremonious count of fifty-two axe swings. In contrast, Qoz, the younger, argued that his additional youth granted him an extended lifespan of the same count, entitling him to an equal share.\n\nA challenge was issued: each brother would take turns striking the mightiest tree of the grove, and the one who felled it would become the rightful owner. Swing after swing, the brothers persevered, but the resilient tree absorbed every hit. Suddenly, upon completion of the fifty-second swing, the axe fractured.\n\nIn the echo of the ensuing silence, a hissing laugh emerged from the brothers. With the axe rendered useless and the tree standing unbowed, it was clear the gods had spoken: there would be no single victor. Both brothers, linked by a shared heritage, were to share the grove. From that day forth, it was proclaimed that no dispute within its vicinity could end in discord."

As the war drums echo, a tribal elder lifts his well-worn garurt high into the air. 'What is this?' he bellows. 'An axe!' replies the gathering, their voices filling the night with the promise of solidarity. The elder's voice thunders again, 'And to whom does the axe belong?'

 S14_vinegrids_desc: "Listen closely and you will hear the Ishalanas jungle's ever-throbbing heartbeat; the rhythmic shuffle of logs over the Vinegrids, each slide and shift a note contributing to the harmonious blend of muscle, vine, and wood. A remarkable innovation born not of metal or stone, but from the living sinews of Ishalani's leafy domain. Deft claws and a keen understanding of their environment transform sturdy vines into sprawling lattices, cradling the weight of smoothly felled logs above the uneven jungle floor. Like serpents undulating through the undergrowth, these Vinegrids allow heavy logs to glide with a grace that belies their bulk."

This simple, unselfish act marked the inception of the Green Pact. It was more than a mere exchange of goods—it was an assurance of neutrality, an act of goodwill that softened the harsh reality of territorial expansion.\n\nThe Green Pact has since outlived the conflict that birthed it. Today, it serves as a validation of the Ishalani tribe's expansion, weaving a compelling narrative of shared growth and mutual benefit. A historical gesture of peace reverberating in the Ishalani's dealings, tempering any resentment their growth may otherwise inspire."

This intense, alluring coloration not only sets them apart but serves as an emblem of their spiritual authority. The spectrum of red and blue that permeates their scales is more than a mere physical attribute; it is a visual sermon in of itself.\n\nPerhaps one day their radiance can serve as a beacon to the heretics in the north-east and ground their obsession with beauty back to the spiritual."

It is said that he came down from where land, sea and stars met, gathered people around and showed them how to unlock the light within.\n\nSince then we have been set apart by our people being born with an extra eye, the Eyes of Trazosk, which he granted to all his followers and descendants. This eye grants us a preternatural extra sense, as the third eye will twitch and blink when it seems to notice something the other two don’t, putting the individual on alert. We associate this with greater mystic erudition among our best, as that already valuable sense is even more useful when magical forces are wrought."

 L74_the_branches_of_the_tialzas_desc: "The Tialzas trees form the core of Zatal, for it is around the first-discovered by Trazosk that our nation started, and it is by planting them wherever we go that our borders are marked. The Tialzas with its reflective bark, towering height and the distinctive metallic-smelling sap serves that demarcation purpose well.\n\nThe trees provide us all that we need with their branches: our buildings, our weapons and instruments, for Tialzas wood is supple and yet near indestructible when wrought properly. When war comes to our land upon the Ashhama borders, it is for their protection that we fight."
 L74_the_natural_servants: "The Natural Servants"
 L74_the_natural_servants_desc: "Jacil Suncast brought about reforms when they took control of the Zatalas realm, guiding those who would have once become independent shamans or druids into the Natural Servants, the foundation of Zatal’s civil service. Their primary role was in shaping construction and planning, working with the land with their skills and magicks to allow construction to operate in synthesis with nature rather than against it.\n\nTheir labour bringing down costs gave them the power to expand their role as they transitioned into a full bureaucracy. As the people who came from the place where worlds collided, the power over each sphere that the Natural Servants possessed in their terraforming capability came to enjoy a special place of awe in Zatalas society.

The hall was  engineered to take full advantage of artistic trends in lighting and acoustics. Famously, the Hall echoed one’s voice back to oneself, forcing parliamentarians to hear their own words. This engendered a better class of politician, encouraging greater honesty by making lying in such a manner harder.

As Butterburn's economy consisted predominantly of dairy products, these practices gave rise to the Butter Baronesses, a powerful group of female merchants who dominated the region.\n\nThe Baronesses had an immense impact on Butterburn by organising its dairy workers into a unified guild known as the Churners’ Guild, where both knowledge and techniques were shared and formal butter-making training was taught to any would-be churners. The result was this innovative system of quality control granted Butterburn its reputation for superior butter as well as a thriving butter monopoly and a price advantage for Butterburn's churners."

Their diet, however, may also play a part in this. Aside from using butter for nearly every recipe from delicate flaky pastries to rich heavy sauces, many Butterburner dishes are cooked in fat like deep-fried pork scratchings, sweet and savoury fritters, and sugared doughnuts. Whether by coin purse or by stomach, Butterburners are certainly the fattest of the halflings."

The Dragonhills cheeses were firm, nutty, and buttery with a wonderfully gooey texture when melted. Though they differed from the typically mild and soft cheeses locally made in Butterburn, it was no surprise that these cheeses came into high demand in Butterburn. Paired with Bluefoot expatriates longing for the flavours of their homeland, a vast network of country roads and carriage paths soon developed in Ciderfield, all of which led to Butterburn. Known colloquially as the Goldbrick Roads for the shape and colour of the goods ferried upon them, they connected hundreds of small dairy farms within Butterburn to the markets in the Dragonhills and back again."

Sharp barbs were hidden behind innocent commentary, mockery privately indulged with oily smiles. Promises were only ever generously hinted at, rarely affirmed; behind every veneer of truth lay one hundred ways to bend it through generous interpretation.\n\nThe most infamous incident of this came in a rare moment of agreement by the Earls of Pearview and Appleton when both bemoaned being lured by smooth-talking Butterburn diplomats into signing a trade agreement fixing the price of butter at a low point in 1646, not knowing that the merchants of the west would also apply the heavily-lowered price to their artisan pear butters and apple butters by virtue of sharing the same label.

With the approval of the Churners’ Guild, the merchants opened the Great Butter Exchange to help regulate the critical trade of all dairy products. By pooling the supply from a legion of farmstead butter-churners and cheesemakers, Butterburn grew into one of the world's largest dairy export markets. In its heyday, Butterburn regularly had riverboats and caravans from the nearby kingdoms coming to the region to stock up on its goods; Reveria and the Gnomish Hierarchy, in particular, were keen on supplying their colonies. Demand was said to be so high that the Great Butter Exchange was open day and night."

It was, at first, not an unusual sighting, the first bog bodies near Butterburn had been discovered half a century prior by farmers doing the same thing. While the farmer did find a keg of ancient preserved butter, what stood out in this incident were the other items found alongside the gnome's body: birch-bark manuscripts, which the ancient gnomes had used for writing prior to the adoption of parchment.\n\nCovering various topics from philosophy to administrative documents, these manuscripts made Butterburn famous across Cannor and proved invaluable for historiography of ancient Lencenor. Most important for the halflings were the extensive inscriptions in the Old Halfling language, which proved to be crucial for the language's reconstruction."

He declared a war of vengeance on Mukis in the very same month. The war was swift as Mukis was struggling from a famine spawned from the foolish king’s deal. Within a year, most of Mukis had fallen and its weakened armies were routed into one-sided massacres.

 S19_victors_dagafita_desc:0 "When the Dagafita was fought hundreds of years ago, soldiers of Qabiika Beeragga slaughtered our allies in the Ashamadi and broke the peace that the merfolk had brought about in the previous century. As they burned down villages and slaughtered people, the honest king of Weggabiga rose to answer the call of Gawakhiza and Dadubakha.\n\nMen from all across Weggabiga marched upon the Beeraggan armies, forcing them back to their fort in Qasri Mjeeda. Eventually, the northern coalition would even break their walls too, as they took the war into the heartlands of Qabiika Beeragga.\n\nUltimately, as the war drew to a near stalemate, and the coalition could not bypass the mountains blocking off the north from the rich lands of Beeragga, their king fell dead to an assassination plot, led by his own son. With that, he sued for peace, and the northern kingdoms had become the victors to the last war held in the lands of the Jasiir Jadid. \n\nThe men of Weggabiga rejoice in their proud victory; the small man beating down a titan of tyranny, securing the independence of not only Weggabiga, but the northern Baashidi as a whole."

This has given Weggabiga a natural advantage over their neighbors, whose lands are either so forested or so prone to droughts that they find themselves stagnant. The river Alnamaliu has remained constant, with its waters bringing prosperity, and its depth allowing for travel far into the interior. This constant water supply allows for farms the size of palaces, and a surplus of crops every year.\n\nThese fertile lands have allowed for a strong Weggabiga, formed from its own soil. They will soon lead Weggabiga into a future of prosperity."

This shadow serves as a reminder to the citizens of not only the city, but the country of Weggabiga, to recognize the true order in the land.\n\nConstructed in the Century of Merfolk, the jail was expanded to hold the hundreds of soldiers captured in the War of the Millenium. These soldiers would be let free if they defected to the Weggabigan military and gave up information. Those that remained loyal to the Vile Queen in Dadubakha would be murdered, as they were just as untrustworthy as her. When the War of the Millenium ended, the prison transitioned into keeping the scum and criminals away from the good people. Its service since then has seen the downfall of corruption in Weggabiga, as officials do not dare tempt being sent deep within  the iron bars and concrete walls of the Great Jail."

While they served the Vile Queen of Dadubakha in the War of the Millenium, they were pardoned after expressing disdain for the traitorous queen's leadership. They were then organized into a strong military unit. These soldiers fought nobly to restore their kingdom and to depose the Vile Queen.\n\nOnce the war ended, the Jaqadeeq continued as a consolidated mercenary company, serving both the Ashamadi and Weggabiga. They fought to defend the Ashamadi from their Tanizu invaders, and went west to fend off the monstrous lizardfolk, who soon consolidated into one large empire. While much of the main army struggled against the hordes of the 333rd Empire, the Jaqadeeq militia managed to fight off and even earn small victories against all odds. Their tactics revolved around laying traps, and using explosives whenever possible in an attempt to keep a distance from the stronger and larger forces so that their firepower could remain advantageous. When these tactics were adopted by the main Weggabigan armies, they had great successes in their war, and ultimately they were able to force a draw against the massively larger forces of the lizardfolk."

 S19_city_of_wealth_desc:0 "Abeesooyinka is the largest city amongst the Baashidi. Being on the Ashamadiat plain gave the city a major advantage from the start, but the city truly came to prominence after the arrival of the Cannorians. The first Baashidi city in the path of commerce and contact, Abeesooyinka grew to encompass the needs of the Busilari and Anbennarians who would come down to trade with them. More profit soon flowed into the city, starting a cycle of perpetual growth. As Cannorians continued to stop in the city to see what the Baashidi were like, inspect relics, and indulge in their culture, the city grew to global significance, becoming one of the largest in Sarhal.\n\nThis gigantic amount of wealth brought even further prosperity to the Ashamadiat plain, giving it the strength to remove the tools of old and replace it with the technology of new. Abeesooyinka would become one of the jewels of Sarhal, and a truly modernized city comparable to those in Cannor."

Throughout history, traders fared the seas against rough shores, pirates, lizardfolk raiders, and the occasional rumored deep devils coming up to destroy ships and rush back into the depths of the ocean. \n\nThese hardy men of Weggabiga, plentiful as they were, hardened themselves during times of war, and shared the battlefield at sea along with their brothers in the navy. To protect their country and pride, they brought their ships to serve under the crown, and to fight when needed. These ships provided a strong defense against the encroaching Busilari Empire, who had begun to encroach on Baashidi lands long ago with the conquest of the Jasiir Doog. The Ashamadi kingdoms, united as one alongside Weggabiga, were able to inflict heavy defeats on the great Lion Armada, forcing the Busilari to abandon all hopes of conquering the Baashidi."

Defeating many invasions from Beeragga, Lizardfolk, and more, they assured their Ashamadi allies that they would stand the test of time. With every defeat the invaders suffered, the more frustrated they became, until they realized that the costs were too high and eventually called off the campaign.\n\nWeggabiga’s domination of the northern Baashidi would be further questioned, not by a regional power, but by Busilar and her large colonial army. Wanting to secure the lands of not only the north, but the whole of the Jasiir Jadid itself, the strong men of Weggabiga marched southwards to assist the rest of the Baashidi coalition to fight off the Busilari forces on the mainland.\n\nUltimately, the Baashidi would prove  victorious, and Busilar would have to suffer the curse which so many other invaders had met before them."

 Z90_the_turnwell_league_desc:0 "The Butter Baronesses of Butterburn and the Bull Barons of Cowskeep, tired of the recurring squabbles of their overlords in Pearview and Appleton respectively, formed an alliance. Not wishing to give one side more power than the other, Butterburn ceded the rapidly-growing city of Turnwell as an independent capital for the newly-founded partnership. Appropriately named the Turnwell League, the city’s position at the confluence of the Portroy and Burroy Rivers allowed the League to manipulate trade between the Small Country and Dragon Coast. Rather than limiting power to the Bluefoot oligarchs of its partners, Turnwell was notable for letting the local Redfoot Halflings ascend to the city leadership. Its diverse populace and welcoming atmosphere has even led to the occasional Iochander, Reverian, and Creek Gnome holding a seat."

Built in the days of the Gnomish Hierarchy and paved with slabs of white stone, Turnwell’s arterial thoroughfare provides smooth travels and easy navigation through the city, its other streets branching off of it like the spokes of a wheel. Thanks to the volume of traffic flowing through the Roundabout, almost all of Turnwell’s businesses have established their shops along its path, hoping to entice travelers and caravans with their wares and services."

In adapting the Redfoot custom for extravagant hospitality, however, they quickly found their niche: cream. With a touch of Gnomish artificery to develop new kitchen utensils, Turnwellian chefs competed to outdo one another in increasingly inventive applications of the ingredient in desserts: rich custard puddings, dainty trifles of whipped cream and sponge cake, and later clotted cream to be served with scones and Newshire tea. This all culminated in the presentation of a vanilla bean ice cream—slow-churned for a dense yet smooth texture—to celebrate Turnwell’s admission into the Small Country at the rebuilt Rainbow Hall, further elevating the city’s status in culinary circles. After all, it is how the popular Turnwellian saying goes: “Ideas are like cream—good ones rise to the top.”"

The rapid urbanization of the 1600s, however, resulted in far more tallfolk than the Roundabout could safely handle, leading to increasing incidents of human-driven carts accidentally trampling one of the smallfolk and the deterioration of Turnwell’s most beloved street. Then-Mayor Gelman Turner thus implemented the Turnpike, delineating the innermost lane of the Roundabout for tallfolk on mounts or carts while smallfolk and pedestrians kept to the sides. While merchants grumbled about the mandatory toll placed on its usage, residents appreciated the security of the Roundabout and knowing that all the coin made on the turnpike went back into maintaining and improving all of their streets."

 Z90_portroy_reaver_privateers_desc:0 "In its heyday, plentiful food and coin flowed into Turnwell, garnering the attention of some desperate Reverian mercenary companies. They were first employed as security guards for Turnwell League barges making their way downriver to sea, where they might face other Reverians engaging in piracy. These companies quickly grew in size—numerically and physically—thanks to the generous pay of Turnwellian merchants in gold, beef, and dairy. Soon, their jobs turned from simple protection to harassing rival merchant ships along the Portroy, a move that drove almost all merchants to make Turnwell the preferred city of departure when using the river. While this would eventually backfire on the city by inciting Iochand’s conquest of it, Reverians still remember Turnwell as a city of plenty."

 Z90_well_made_twill_desc:0 "Wool imported from the Dragonhills and Reveria makes its way to Turnwell, where weavers warp and weft yarn into a sturdy twill weave cloth. Turnwell twill, distinguished from cloth made elsewhere from their insistence on using local natural dyes rather than the artificially bright hues of Viswall’s pigments, found common use in outdoor wear within the Small Country and Dragon Coast. Coats made in Turnwell eventually became fashionable among the upper and middle classes of the Small Country, woven with striking houndstooth and herringbone patterns. Even with the onset of industrial textile mills, Turnwell continued to create twill cloth, the durability and cheapness of which made the fabric an ideal material for military fatigues in the late 1700s."
 Z90_the_reckoning:0 "The Reckoning"
 Z90_the_reckoning_desc:0 "“Country Reckoning” was an archaic method of timekeeping stemming from the early days of the Small Province, a surprisingly complex lunisolar calendar that, while generally keeping to 12 months, has many peculiarities: varying leap months, standalone holidays, and a multi-year cycle, to name a few. With halflings’ adoption of Common and the Castanorian calendar following the War of Falling Stars, “Country Reckoning” fell into disuse and was relegated to a term for “folksy timekeeping”. The surviving remnants of a clear Reckoning calendar that could be gathered from its scattered legacy—localized idioms, half-remembered folktales, and vibrant petty feuds between villages over the correct date to hold certain holidays—was a mess for historians to decipher.\n\nThen in 1763, road workers in Turnwell uncovered an unusual find: a circular stone sundial, its face engraved with faded patterns of the cosmos and depictions of nature. Along its border was writing, some recognized as very archaic Gnomish adjacent to scribbles that archaeologists were just beginning to recognize as the Old Halfling script. Despite conspiracy theories claiming the sundial held the date for the world’s end, further analysis revealed the stone slab to be the only surviving calendar written in Country Reckoning, finally allowing historians to better discern actual dates from Halfling folktales."

The Khetist settlers who moved to Chibuswa were in constant competition to flaunt their wealth through extravagant clothing and ornate manors. Its reputation attracted more rich Khetist nobles, which in turn brought more merchants to the city to peddle their wares.

There, beads of every imaginable color and complexion were strung together into elaborate sashes, often containing thousands of beads. Being able to decipher the language of beadwear was a skill unto itself, and different sashes were worn for different occasions.

The vast majority of the population are Vurebindu. The Khetist settlers married local nobles as a means of assuring their local political power. Most who moved to the nation were those seeking better opportunities, like the Kuivahni to the north. There’s a certain entrepreneurial spirit amongst those who move here - as anyone who has been haggled by merchants walking through the Chibuswa marketplace will attest to.

Things changed when the Vyzemby started monopolising the trade from the Baashidi people and Haless in the 1600s. With traders no longer naturally stopping at Horashesh ports, the merchants of Horashesh started aggressively sending out their own merchant fleets to secure this lucrative trading route."

To be swift-of-foot is to be “gazelle-like” for instance. To be “like a lion” in Irsukuba has nothing to do with ferocity or bravery though. Instead it refers to the ability to be stealthy, referencing the lion’s remarkable ability to remain undetected in tall grass despite its size.

The sounds are supposed to mimic that of an elephant, who only blow their trumpet to intimidate foes when the herd is being threatened. This is why it’s a symbol of peace.

This tradition died once Kheterata drew national borders and demanded tribute from each region, forcing nations to compete for resources lest they draw the ire of our vengeful overlords.

The great Irsukuba thinker and writer Imhale Zakwa was one of the leading voices behind wanting to move the nation’s focus towards peace and trade. In opposition was the head of the military, Ayanda Shuka. He had a different idea: he placed Imhale in charge of a small battalion with the task of wiping out a rebel army led by old Khetist nobility. His force was wiped out and Imhale was killed. Ayanda then took a similar-sized battalion and easily routed the Khetist rebels.\n\nAyanda had secretly fed the rebels information on Imhale’s troop movements, and only gave Imhale soldiers who were known slackers and troublemakers.

The final step is to coat the bar in honey and you have the perfect snack. Its ease of transport and long-lasting properties made locust bars the ideal ration food, but they are also loved by children across the country as a special treat.\n\nUnfortunately attempts to export this local delicacy had not been successful, outside of a few enterprising merchants in Fahvanosy.

Each new scar on the shield would become a tale of heroism that would be immortalised on the crest for generations.\n\nFamily crests changed drastically over time. Sometimes the son would die in battle and the crest would not make it back to the family, so a new shield had to be made. But the greatest change to crests came with the advent of modern technology. Since the crest-weapons were expected to be used in battle, many families replaced the traditional spears with muskets, sporting charms hanging off the barrel as a nod to the feathers that adorned their older weaponry.

In the wake of Jaher’s conquest of Rahen, the Kingdom of Fetengoni jumped on the opportunity to profit off of the burgeoning slave trade between Rahen and East Sarhal by founding the grand port city of Yetmesira. Its location at the mouth of the Yet river made it the perfect middle ground between the Raheni merchants across the sea, and the slave traders funnelling their goods downriver.\n\nThousands of Fetengoni slaves were shipped to the coast to build its foundations. The bodies of those who could not bear the working conditions are found regularly during construction in and around the original structures. Despite heavy losses, the practice proved rather effective, inspiring the “Final Service Act”, a law which required all slaves to contribute towards construction and maintenance of the city before they could be placed on the market. This act remains in place to this day, despite Fetengoni overlordship ending nearly a century ago."

In need of something to pass the time, many took to the arts to occupy their days, especially literature. One such work that has seen distribution beyond our city is the novel “Kidgeben”, or “The Divine Market”.\n\nThe novel is a retelling of the founding of Yetmesira from the perspective of an angel sent to oversee the construction of the entrance to the Holy Land. The Holy Land was once inhabited by evil spirits and beasts, before Amilak the one God chose this land for his chosen people, the Mengi. Amilak, ever merciful, allowed these creatures to stay within the Holy Land, sentenced to labour for their wickedness, banishing only the most vile to a dark, evil land to the west. And thus, under the supervision of His angels, the demons built the entrance to the Holy Land, Yetmesira, where they were then cast out from, upon their repentance.\n\nWhile never claiming to be a factual retelling, considering angels never existed in Mengi Myth before the arrival of Kamniel, the novel has become popular with the faithful across the Holy Land, sparking a renaissance of religious texts."

Their tortured souls corrupted the foundations, and they began to rot away. The corruption crept up into the city, slowly morphing the Mengi citizens until they looked and acted no different than the spirits who they banished. The story ends with the city falling apart, causing the former citizens to lament their sinful ways, and sail out in search of the demons they banished, who they now consider their kin.\n\nThis novel sparked plenty of discussion across Melakmengi, raising concerns over the morality of slavery and its continued practice.

After centuries of intermingling, they merged into a single people: the Kooras.

As both these Paleptaiinky and the Kooras deciding to settle in the Tokal were generally isolated and suspicious of foreigners, the area knew much less mingling than in the Tli’yam Kyin or Tsewee Kyin. Instead, the Kooras outgrew the local Paleptaiinky in number, pushing them further and further to the outskirts of the Tokal, reaching a point where most Paleptaiinky assimilated in the bordering Kooras tribes instead of the Kaiinpi.”-Excerpt from The Haraf Account, Vol.3"

To them, the masks not only store the spirits of past and future wearers but also serve as catalysts for their souls to rejoin Cheshosh in death, repairing the mind of the god, as well as to help screen their Sin from foreigners.

As tradition for the tribe, a Necali Tournament was held a month later in order to decide the next holder of the King Mask.

This realm was governed by an authoritarian council of priests and warriors, and saw many changes to the worship of Cheshosh in their lands.\n\nThe biggest of these shifts was their proclamation that Cheshosh did not demand sacrifices, instead only needing to absorb the souls of metaphorical deaths, such as after a Spirit Feud, to reincarnate.

While luck played a role in this discovery, so did our patience and extensive observation of the seedthralls.

Many have tried to stop the spread or find a cure, but even our best attempts have only resulted in extending their suffering for a few moments longer.\n\nEven a tribe of healers and talented craftsmen have a need of self defense, however. With our spears and arrows coated in the toxin and traps laid out all around our campsites, very few of the ravenous beasts here ever dare tread into our territory anymore. While they may not be able to communicate with us, they have learned from repeatedly testing our defenses, just to succumb to the toxins we employ.

Most beasts of the jungle shy away from even attempting to damage the trees, both because they are as hard as any stone, and because such actions would draw the goddess' ire. Our craftsmen start by taking part in a somber song; this ritual draws them to trees that our goddess allows us to use. Any deviation from this would result in the collapse of our tribe, and the hatred of our goddess. When the craft begins to take form, the song shifts to one of veneration and honor for the now husk of a tree, though its natural beauty is still apparent.

Shamans, on the other hand, attune more strongly and gain an instinctual understanding of the beast they wear, such as sensing their presence and intuitively deciphering their behavior.

Before long, the savage northmen had crushed many of the forces the kingdom could muster, and the people would not rise to aid the realm. The great thinkers and strategists of the royal court toiled fruitlessly over impossible plans to rebuild the army, until insight suddenly struck in an unexpected place. The court jester suggested something more familiar to the people, a simple comedic stage play, to be shown all across the kingdom. \nThe Sildthol Seven follows the story of a ragtag band of Iochanders, three gnomes and three humans, led by the halfling captain Arnol Bravefoot. Stationed in a backwater outpost in the County of Sildthol, they are first to discover a company of reavers, intending a surprise attack while the King's army fought in the north. Stuck between a reaver and a hard place, they wage a campaign of guerilla warfare with tricks, traps, and illusion, leveraging their wits against the bumbling and brutish northmen. The production was a runaway success, and countless Iochanders enlisted in the King's army, energised by new dreams of fun and glory. The popularity of the play did not fade over time, and has been adapted to every medium from bard song to bedtime story, inspiring each new generation to defend Iochand."

Actors and authors come from far and wide to learn the dramatic arts, and behind the curtain stagehands study the science of pyrotechnics and stage effects, pushing Iochander theatre to new heights of creativity. In the countryside's idyllic fields, scholars experiment with dazzling new innovations of artificery, ever striving to further augment Iochand's agricultural output and keep the kingdom on the cutting edge."

The Royal Jester's mask remains the same, but with each encounter, the voice changes, the mannerisms shift, and courtiers are never sure of whether the figure with whom they were speaking was a different act, or a different jester.

The gallant Greencaps, a company of elite warriors, armed to the teeth, and drilled into a lethal machine, stand as leaders amongst the rank and file, using their experience to outwit and outlast the enemies of Iochand, and striking fear into all who oppose them.\n But then again, not everything in Iochand is based on a true story. The Greencaps are not an elite order, or even a formal component of the army. In truth, the green caps are given to soldiers with experience in the performing arts, and rotate through the regiments, the wearer tasked with the honour of entertaining their comrades by telling tales of past glory, improvising ruthless mockery of their foes, and staying their hearts with songs of hope. The reputation of the green cap is no secret to its wearers, and they take pride in maintaining the great deception, in hopes that the doubts of the enemy may become opportunities for clever tactics, leaving them as clueless as they are defeated."

He sought  asylum with the Shagadyrra tribes with whom he had established a rapport, in the hopes of easing tensions. He quickly entered their Raktaya’s council and reformed the military in the midst of conflict with the Ishalani.\n\nWhen the Raktaya passed, Anzaraz was chosen to lead and immediately used the opportunity to place his older and newer allies in important positions, effectively ruling jointly with them.\n\nSoon after this, he rallied the Shagadyrra to siege Khugra, which almost saw its surrender. However, Anzaras was forced to break the siege in response to an incursion from the Ishalani. With a treaty gaining moderate trade concessions and access to Khugra’s port for Great Journeys, he marched east and successfully defended and expanded control of the frontier for future development.\n\nVictorious, Anzaras organized the largest Great Journey in centuries and departed Khudra, leaving his closest advisors to jointly rule in perpetuity until his return."

Living on the banks of the most turbulent section of the fast-running Adzalaz River, just outside of the headwater, the Shagadyrra people developed a school of hydromancy to master it. Whereas most Nanshyn hydromancy involves manipulation of oceanic saltwater, the practice of Adzashana specifically involves utilizing freshwater.\n\nAt first the school focused on mitigating damage from intense flooding and easing river crossings, but was quickly utilized for agricultural development. Throughout the centuries, a dozen primary artificial distributaries were split off from the Adzalaz, splitting into more that feed hundreds of small, intensively cultivated farms throughout their lands."

 L94_throdaktaya_desc:0 "Like tributaries branching off from a raging river, the Soul Shard concentrations of every great ruler have branched off into distributaries, flowing into every still-living close companion, advisor, or family member. As an inevitable consequence, subsequent rulers inherited fewer Shards with each generation, resulting in weaker leadership as they dispersed throughout the Lizardfolk population.\n\nTo counter this, the Shagadyrra developed the concept of Throdaktaya, “multi rulers.” When a great leader perishes, their closest and most competent loved ones and advisors rule in tandem, with the belief that their collective Soul Shards had an additive effect on rule. This would last until only one member remained alive who assumed sole leadership, retaining all of the Shards from the predecessor.\n\nThe idea of Throdaktaya expanded to the localized management of each Adzalaz distributary, each administered by local tribes ruled by leaders with highest Shard concentrations. Their relationship to the Raktaya would allow the ruler to inherit soul shards from the entire population. This would become the basis for the development of the Shagadyrra’s democratic identity."

In the centuries after this disastrous and embarrassing first attempt to defeat the diplomatically isolated polity, they would continue to besiege the city multiple times with subsequent failures, adapting their siege tactics that allowed them to come closer to success with each attempt.\n\nAdzashana hydromancy became an instrumental part of these endeavors. Temporary large dams would be built and maintained, until released on the city, resulting in fighting between opposing hydromancers seeking to mitigate or maximize damage. Artificial waterways would also be created as a way to transfer supplies amongst troops besieging the city or on the frontier."

With life centered around the harsh Adzalaz, a prominent priesthood developed around worship of the river deity.\n\nWhile integral to the development and implementation of adzashana, the war spirit’s Naga priesthood holds a predominant presence in the military. During conflicts, they would be present in specialized adzashana Naga divisions. Prominent members would also be present in military leadership, at times even serving as second-in-command to a ruler or general.\n\nWith war and hydromancy at the forefront of their faith, the Zurzis Priesthood rarely got involved in the politics regarding leadership and succession.

Rather, the Lizardfolk from the Shagadyrra and beyond, should join their flow as tributaries, strengthening their collective will.\n\nOne day with enough power, the waters of the Shagadyrra will crash into the ocean and succeed where all others have failed in locating and reawakening Naga-Katesh. And only on that day will the true and final 333rd empire will prove itself to be born."

In turn, the collected urine was sold to dyeworks as mordant or to leatherworkers to tan hides; in the case of feces, it was exported to villages just outside the city walls for use as fertilizer.

 J84_on_the_shoulders_of_giants: "On The Shoulders Of Giants"
 J84_on_the_shoulders_of_giants_desc: "Ebenanth, Yodhan, Ueltaron, Olhokar. These rulers conquered Taychend; only for their empires to crumble after their demise. The Nakari and Gophirans also conquered Taychend, and attempted to build a longer lasting empire… But in the end, they failed as well.\n\nThis is all in the past now, for Taychend is once again united under our rule. But one thing is certain: we must not let history repeat. We stand on the shoulders of giants, whose achievements and failures shaped our present reality, and while all those that came before us failed to build a truly unified Taychend, they will serve as a lesson for our emperors and scholars.\n\nEvery mistake our forebears made will be studied in detail, every folly analyzed, every success investigated, and every achievement a goal to be outdone."
 J84_paths_of_ascension: "Paths Of Ascension"
 J84_paths_of_ascension_desc: "Our faith in the divinity of ascended heroes has created an issue now that there is no more endemic warfare in Taychend. The easiest way for a common peasant to ascend, through combat and bravery, has been closed to them. For most this is a cause for celebration. But those with ambition will see their opportunities to ascend dwindling before their very eyes.\n\nThus, we have set out a new program to encourage the pursuits of less war-like occupations that give our more ambitious citizens the opportunity to become gods. Most notably, this program has led to an increase in intellectual pursuits; even among the lower classes."
 J84_the_taychendi_peace: "The Taychendi Spring"
 J84_the_taychendi_peace_desc: "Ever since the ruin of Aelantir, Taychend knew nothing but warfare and chaos. For millennia and beyond, the most common way a farmer could meet his end was either on the field of battle or at the edge of a marauding soldier’s blade.\n\nWith the end of unavailing warfare came a population explosion. As new generations were raised in peace and prosperity, as new crops and farming techniques spread to Taychend by way of Cannorian traders and experts; the population growth accelerated ever further to unforeseen heights."
 J84_an_army_of_millions: "An Army Of Millions"
 J84_an_army_of_millions_desc: "Taychend’s enormous population led to a massive excess of recruits; something high-ranking commanders quickly realised and exploited. They morphed the imperial doctrine to fit this new reality, and millions of young warriors voluntarily joined the army to be sent as garrisons or to fight upon the frontiers against the barbarians. Whenever outsiders dared to try to attack the empire, a quick mobilization of hundreds of thousands of soldiers was all it took for them to leave."
 J84_tailatam_system: "The Tailatam System"
 J84_tailatam_system_desc: "During the waning days of the 2nd Gophiran Empire, a philosopher named Tailatam wrote a series of books detailing his thoughts on how the Taychendi empire of his day could best secure its future and end the warlord cycle. While he died before he ever saw his writings be applied to the real world, his writings would form the core of what became known as the “Tailatam System”.\n\nThe Tailatam System was a form of governance practiced by the empire of Taychend. At the top of the hierarchy sits the emperor, who appoints provincial governors to the provinces. These governors can be removed at any time, and only have a term of 5 years. After every 5 years, these governors return to the capital either to be fired or to be assigned to a different province. During their meeting with the emperor, they must share bread and wine while showing utter loyalty, and risking execution if they fail to do so.\n\nNobility was not inherited under the Tailatam system. All land was owned by the emperor, and was “rented out” to the aristocracy. Thus, the nobility were forced to stay loyal; obeying all orders of the emperor and the provincial governors. For if they disobeyed, they would lose their position immediately… Along with their heads."
 J84_imperial_cult: "Cult Of The Emperors"
 J84_imperial_cult_desc: "The task of ruling an empire the size of Taychend was no small feat, it could even be considered to be of legendary proportions. Thus it was no surprise to many that upon the death of the first emperor, they were declared a god. Subsequently, all emperors were declared gods upon death and, as their statues appeared in every city, the imperial cult became widespread. With this, the common people now felt they had a connection with the royal family. This not only reduced unrest in the empire, but also raised the loyalty of commoners towards the king and crown."
 J84_unregulated_artificery: "Unregulated Artificery"
 J84_unregulated_artificery_desc: "In the 1600s, a new, smaller, kind of outsider arrived on our shores, bringing with them strange magically powered inventions. Known as “artificery”, many of our leaders were quick to see its potential, especially with all the ancient, powerful relics found in Taychend. These relics, as it turned out, were very useful in the application of artificery, which was the reason these foreigners came to our land to begin with.\n\nIt was decided to invite more of these “artificers” to come to our land, where they could practice and innovate upon their inventions freely and openly; away from the watchful gaze of the Ravelian Church and the Gommo. Their only concession was that they must share with us any and all artificer inventions useful for warfare. They either agreed to our terms or were promptly returned to where they had originally fled from."

 S65_long_lasting_mukis_desc:0 "Though the main tribe claims ancient descent, the kingdom of Mukis is not so old, having become  a true kingdom only in the mid-1200s. Yet despite its remarkably rural land and lack of great feats, the kingdom of Mukis quietly prospered, absorbing tribes around it mostly peacefully through fair negotiation and rarely fighting any offensive war, though wars in defence of these new tribes were fairly common. Through this method of diplomacy and ready protection, Mukis’s subject tribes were quite happy to pay their tribute, and few unkind words were spoken of the good king. It was thus that Mukis calmly became the largest Talilibeti kingdom, and remained so for over a century until the recent conflict with Huugeta saw our momentary decline."
 S65_myth_baachkis:0 "The Myth of Baachkis"
 S65_myth_baachkis_desc:0 "Hero of an old Talilibeti myth from the Gumuk, a tribe of old from before the Days of Darkness, Baachkis was a warrior whose family was stolen by trolls. He vowed to Amilak that he would find them and slay their captors and was granted rites declaring him a man already dead, then he passed into the swamp to hunt. It is said he slew trolls by the dozen with methods he learned in dreams and planted their tusks in the marshy earth to taunt their accursed hag mistresses. The end to the tale is disputed, though most agree he was tricked by one of the hags, commonly Hireet Smoketusk who had taken the image of his wife, and killed in some manner indescribably horrid. Nevertheless, we of the ije Duuk-Ijabaach claim descent from this hero, and our people use this tale as the source of a martial tradition older than memory. Some fools spread the tale that the child of Baachkis from whom we descend was by the Hag herself, but this is of course preposterous."
 S65_peace_isolation:0 "Peace in Isolation"
 S65_peace_isolation_desc:0 "When people cast their eyes on maps of Mengi, where do their eyes go? To the cities of the Yeteferen and Ofehibi, magnanimous and courteous, with kings adorned in jewels and silks. To the lakes of the Sitewosi, rich in salt and fish or to the gorgeous heights of the Metobesebi, looming righteously over the plain. If they gaze upon the lands of us Talilibeti it is to the borders of the dread swamp, perilous and infested with troll raiders, not to here. In Mukis we are left at peace while the conqueror kings of other nations focus on targets they foolishly determine more important; in Mukis we are left to live, to laugh, to feel the winds on our faces and appreciate that the important struggle is but life itself."
 S65_dhagadach:0 "Dhagadach"
 S65_dhagadach_desc:0 "The ‘Shadowplace’ is a rumoured spot in Mukis where shamans with knowledge of the little practised necromantic healing of the Talilibeti gather, to share knowledge and take apprentices. To the outside, this is indeed just a rumour, but it is all true. \n\nIn the deep groves of the jungle there lies a shrouded glen with gnarled and winding old branches, catching the sun’s rays even on the brightest day and keeping the earth endarkened. Here the oral tradition of ‘Dhagadefen’, Shadowhealing, is passed between hushed mouths. Here, knowledge of the magical uses of Ghost’s Breath and of the potency within even the smallest whiff of The Last Wish may be learned, here deep trances to commune with hags are carefully conducted, here even mortal wounds can be laughed away as scratches at a cackling word. A shadow-healer from Dhagadach is commonly a more safe practitioner than others of similar trade, and as such sought after even by less desperate people, despite the unholy nature of their magic. Such a Dhagadach is identifiable, as by tradition both men and women garb themselves in pale grey dresses with more colourful fabric along hems, cuffs, or waistbands, woven into patterns of dancing and feasting skeletal dead."
 S65_dance_shadowking:0 "Dance of the Shadowkings"
 S65_dance_shadowking_desc:0 "Mukis and Huugeta are both kingdoms with tight control of the knowledge that passes in and out of their borders. Though we regretfully admit that Huugeta’s spies are a talented bunch, we have the advantage of geography to our side. Little sound leaves the thick canopy of Mukis without our agents’ knowledge, save for the murmurs of the wind. It was in challenge to Huugetan covert operations in our country that a silent war began with our unscrupulous mercenary neighbours; this period saw few open skirmishes between our border and was mostly a conflict of ears and eyes. Though our diplomats are talented, they were outmatched by the Tamaniouchu saboteurs, and in a foolish act, our king Murti I ije Duuk-Ijabaach sought the aid of the Dhagadach and the hags, aid which slew the king of Huugeta but saw our nation plunged into a famine during which we were too weak to stave off the responding Huugetan attack in 1429."
 S65_making_a_man:0 "Making a Man"
 S65_making_a_man_desc:0 "Dark did our future look, as the armies of King Kojo VI marched toward our capital, yet despite this, the people of Mukis were not cowed. Honed by years of scheming, a spy in the service of the recently returned Kiros II, who had claimed the throne and executed his father for the crime of swearing loyalty to hags, proposed a rather strange plan… \n\nGaruma of Furkis was a talented soldier noted to be present at several key battles, as well as a competent spy, having dented the Huugetan operations on many occasions. His body was found by Tamaniouchu agents washed up on the riverbank, carrying orders to the armies of Mukis, orders to assemble for one last stand at a strategic hill close to the capital. Meticulous as the agents were, they carefully confirmed the truth of the soldier’s identity with captured Mukis soldiers and what stray documents the tribes kept, then ordered the quiet consolidation of their armies for the battle. To their surprise their reorganising forces were struck swiftly by the elite remnants of King Kiros’ army, with the King himself leading the charge, the black mark of the Deathsworn adorned upon his brow. Thus through a clever administrative ruse and a well-prepared corpse- courtesy of the Dhagadefen -the advance of Huugeta was halted, a quick peace was signed, and the kingdom of Mukis was saved."
 S65_making_a_hero:0 "Making a Hero"
 S65_making_a_hero_desc:0 "A strange skill is found among the people of the Talilibeti, a form of biological artificery where flesh and bone are used on the body, similarly to gears or damestear on a machine. This practice appears to have originated in ancient days, related to rituals conducted to invoke the Night Hags of the Yezel Mora, though it has since distanced itself from such rites, likely in an attempt to not rely on the Hags’ malicious aid. This “shadow-growing” produces astounding attributes and is mostly conducted on warriors. Troll-hide is fused onto the skin of warriors to strengthen it with regenerative properties, gorilla limbs are merged into arms to grant them strength to wrestle lions, and eagle eyes wound into the eyes of scouts to grant them vision sharper than iron. However, replacing limbs with those of different creatures can cause rejections; a warrior may, for instance, find their new arm in a constant gruesome effort of detaching itself from the moment it is attached. Corruption is also said to spread from these enhancements, skin is seen to twist and tendons to slacken from its effect - and that is far from the limit of what the stories tell. Thus, few of the warriors live long, most requiring near-constant maintenance that their enchantments do not ooze into rotting decay. The Mengi describe the trolls of the Yezel Mora using similar enhancements, which may explain the source of this dubious practice. \n\nThe tales of a Talilibeti tribe, Mukis, speak of their heroic King Kiros II, said to have mustered an army of warriors enhanced in this manner to defeat his cunning foes in Huugeta. Their songs speak of his soldiers being capable of turning battles almost single-handedly and the king himself being a warrior on par with Baachkis, a hero of their myths and legends."

 G64_merialeth_the_manumitter_desc: "When the skies turned dark, many fled to fortified manors of the ancient lords past, who then used the refugees for their own benefit. In one such manor, built on a defensible cliffside, a city grew, ruled over by a tyrannical lord. He forced the refugees to slave away in the gold mines of the area, for that was but the only way they could receive food and water, which the tyrant controlled.\n\nMerialeth was one such slave who, with a band of followers, escaped into the dangerous countryside. They built up their forces, and, on one stormy night, snuck into the mansion. They sneakily took out every guard in their way, managing to reach the tyrant’s bedside unhindered. Merialeth, with a special magic blade, beheaded the tyrant; ending his reign.\n\nThe next day, she was proclaimed the first queen of Urvand. She freed all the slaves, earning for herself the title “The Manumitter”, liberator, and set about organizing Urvand into a proper city. After 22 years, she left this world, leaving the city to her successors. Every petty noble of Urvand claims descent from the legendary queen, but only a true descendant of Merialeth can rule Urvand."
 G64_highland_horse_armies: "Highland Horse Riders"
 G64_highland_horse_armies_desc: "The Larankarha horse is stronger, tougher, and stockier than their Taychendi contemporaries. While every Larankarha city has their own special breed of Larankarha horse, Urvand’s is noted for not being particularly unique. Instead, Urvand focused on breeding and sustaining massive populations of these horses, such that entire armies of Urvand’s warriors would ride into battle on the saddle. Urvand developed a specialized logistics corps, whose primary duty was not to fight, but to supply everything these horse riders  required."
 G64_the_final_larankarha_kingdom: "The Final Larankarha Kingdom"
 G64_the_final_larankarha_kingdom_desc: "When Urvand consolidated the lands of the Larankarha, it propagated a simple but effective message: Urvand is the ultimate and final kingdom of the Larankarha; and anyone that opposes this will be crushed. This was the core ideology Urvand’s rulers followed, and they even went so far as to rename their state to Larankar to better reflect this unifying ideology. As Urvand subjugated the rest of the Larankarha over the 15th century, it replaced local rulers with puppets that followed this same ideology while cunningly using propaganda to slowly wither away the local identities of the original Larankarha."
 G64_high_city_of_opulence: "High City Of Oppulence"
 G64_high_city_of_opulence_desc: "“I started my rule with Urvand full of ramshackle tents and decaying structures, but left it an organized city built of stone and gold.”\n- the final words of Merialeth\n\nOne of the core goals every ruler of Urvand must follow is to improve their city, as following the will of Merialeth. The core powerbase of the monarch are the citizens of Urvand, who will gladly stay loyal as long as their city is invested in. Thus, the city of Urvand is a beauty full of gold and opulence, resting upon, and expanding to, the cliffside. On the other hand, the opulent gold is mined by slaves and criminals, whose labor is used to build the city of Urvand; the forever expanding city holds this sordid secret deeply within."
 G64_erankar_defier_of_fate: "Erankar, Defier Of Fate"
 G64_erankar_defier_of_fate_desc: "From the moment Erankar took breath, cut free from his mother, and taken by fever as a newborn; he has defied the odds. Be it his daring escape from the hands of Enlarmai after the fall of his city and the execution of his family, his tortuous years spent in the Larankarha wilderness hunting with his bare hands just to survive, the half a decade he spent working his way towards one of the fiercest mercenary bands in Taychend, or his incredible and crushing victory over Enlarmai and the resulting utter destruction of their capital. At every moment, in every crisis, Erankar the Defiant spat in the face of fate, and won.\n\nIt was this defiance – this unceasing determination and unbreakable will – that allowed Erankar to create the largest state of the Larankarha that they had ever seen. And at the Battle of Masialendi, when it was thought that no one could even harm Laskaris the Conqueror let alone kill him, it was this defiance that allowed Erankar to land a near mortal blow on the invader, routing his army, and saving Taychend from total Kheionai dominance. No matter the challenge Larankar faces, the descendants of Erankar will always remember the spirit of the Defiant and fight against the judgements of fate for their people’s ascendency."
 G64_the_hadas_katti: "The Hadas Katti"
 G64_the_hadas_katti_desc: "As outsiders march upon Taychend, many warlords fall and the people suffer, as no one can seemingly stand against them. Yet, there is one kingdom that has proven itself able to resist the foreigners: Larankar. From Erankar almost killing the seemingly invincible Laskaris, to the resistance against the Sun Elves, every Taychendi seeking to liberate their homeland knows who to turn to.\n\nThese exiled warriors who fled to Larankar, joined the kingdom’s army. Known as the Hadas Katti, Blades of Despair, they helped bolster the numbers of Larankar’s armies, aiding in the kingdom’s survival in the centuries to come."
 G64_recovery_against_the_odds: "Recovery Against The Odds"
 G64_recovery_against_the_odds_desc: "It is said that when Erankar visited a local oracle during his march through Kalavend, the oracle spoke of how Erankar’s realm would meet its end “under the coming of the eastern sun”. Erankar, an elf infamous for his defiance and disregard of fate, dismissed this as pointless, for the sun already rose in the east.\n\nIn (YEAR) the Jaherian Exemplars landed in South Aelantir, planning to march into Taychend and spread the truth of Surael. They found an environment ripe for disruption, as the current king of Larankar, a descendant of Erankar the Defiant, had fallen ill and was incapable of ruling. Using this brief period of weakness, the subjugated lords of Kalavend allied themselves with the Sun Elves, and launched an uprising against Larankar.\n\nAs the Kalavendhi-Exemplar alliance marched to Urvand, Larankar’s armies resisted fiercely. The siege of Urvand lasted a year, with the Sun Elves taking the city, freeing its slaves, and razing the capital. Larankar’s empire had fallen. Yet not all hope was lost, as the alliance quickly turned on each other, giving Urvand the respite it needed to rebuild. A century passed, but eventually Urvand persevered, and could shine once more."

 J75_brotherhood_of_the_bloody_cloak_desc: "During the campaigns of Olhokar the Fortuitous against the many remnant Aedzudars of Taychend, many flocked to the banners of Gophira, eager to end Chendhyan dominance over Taychend. However, after Olhokar pacified the Guaraddhi, and the Chendhyan threat seemed to have been vanquished, many went home, content to turn back to shedding the blood of their fellow Taychendi instead.\n\nBut Instead of turning their backs on the Chendhyans – allowing them to regather their strength and threaten Taychend once again – the founding members of the Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak understood the need for constant vigilance and active intervention. And so, ever since Olhokar accepted their offer of service, they have fought back against the Chendhyans, the massive greatsabres and heavy white-and-red armour of the men of Rakkabuttai striking fear into the hearts of Chendhyan warlords and raiders everywhere."
 J75_bulwark_of_the_west: "Bulwark of the West"
 J75_bulwark_of_the_west_desc: "The Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak was founded to protect Taychend from another Chendhyan invasion, and it only takes one look at their many imposing fortress-outposts to know that is exactly what they intend to do. The city of Rakkabuttai itself – the “Pass of Blood” – is a prime example, with the armouries and barracks of the city housing a garrison large enough to dissuade even the most menacing Chendhyan host. The blood-red banners dominating the city walls saw the end of many would-be-Ueltaerons, the soldiers within the city just as important as the walls protecting it.\n\nWith scores of watchtowers, camps and holdfasts strewn across their territory, each with a formidable complement of soldiers because of this “garrison mindset”, the soldiers of the Brotherhood not only had the forces to defend themselves, but to counter attack and punish whoever had the bad idea to attack them – it is no wonder Rakkabuttai was known throughout Taychend as “The Bulwark of the West”"
 J75_the_western_pillar: "The Western Pillar"
 J75_the_western_pillar_desc: "Slavery is an ancient institution in Taychend, with those who ruled before the Ruin keeping much of the population of slaves – and though neither Rakkabuttai or the Brotherhood was initially especially dedicated to the practice, their enmity with the “Chainbreaker” Chendhyans, the Aedzaxas of Caergaraen, has nonetheless driven them into being the steadfast “western pillar” of the Taychendi slave trade, guarding slaver caravans on their way to or from Clematar and selling war captives of their own back to Taychend.\n\nThough their involvement in slavery would be a driving force behind the eventual destruction of Rakkabuttai, as a Caergarae offensive combined with a slave uprising finally forced the soldiers of the Brotherhood from their fortress on the frontier, for centuries it was the main source of funding for Brotherhood activities, and part of what allowed them to maintain such a well-equipped military."
 J75_daratam_the_chargebreaker: "Daratam the Chargebreaker"
 J75_daratam_the_chargebreaker_desc: "Though Daratam was not the founder of the Brotherhood, he is assuredly one of its most capable and important leaders. Rising to become the Lord of Rakkabuttai in the waning days of the War of the Six Emperors, Daratam was forced to contend with the chaotic dissolution of the Second Gophiran Empire. With support from the east cut off, and the Brotherhood having grown complacent and weak due to the support of Gophiran soldiers, it seemed that it was only a matter of time until Rakkabuttai was overrun.\n\nHowever, when a Chendhyan Aedzax led a grand host to destroy the hated Rakkabuttai once and for all, it was through Daratam’s innovative strategies and steadfast determination that Rakkabuttai was saved. Rallying his men around him, and employing every anti-cavalry technique he could think of, Daratam’s forces shattered the charge of the Chendhayan army. Daratam himself slew the Aedzax and his feline mount, saving Rakkabuttai – and perhaps Taychend – from utter devastation, in a feat that the Brotherhood will never forget."
 J75_retribution_payments: "Retribution Payments"
 J75_retribution_payments_desc: "In order to finance the acquisition of new Kheionai-made military equipment, Rakkabuttai established so-called “Retribution Payments” during the mid 1500s. Though cloaked in ideas of retribution and compensation for the damage the Chendhyans had inflicted on Taychend during the days of Ueltareon the Decimator, the true nature of these payments was simple to understand – any village or tribe that paid would avoid the punishing slave and pacification raids to which the Brotherhood would regularly subject them. With the military dominance of the Brotherhood on the steppes increasing, this protection-racket-esque tax was resisted by few, and eventually became vital to Rakkabuttai’s finances."
 J75_taychendi_to_the_hilt: "Taychendi to the Hilt"
 J75_taychendi_to_the_hilt_desc: "Rakkabuttai’s position on the frontier has not tempered their Taychendi identity, in fact it has only strengthened it, with the members of the Brotherhood clinging to the ways of their homeland, the memories of the place they are protecting spurring them in their sacred mission. Among the Taychendi soldiers of Rakkabuttai, this sense of cultural unity and zeal has bound them together, and the men and women of the Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak stand more united than much of the rest of the subcontinent."
 J75_twelve_laws_of_tessenades: "Twelve Laws of Tessenades"
 J75_twelve_laws_of_tessenades_desc: "Tessenades Puresteel was a leader of Rakkabuttai in the early 1600s, a time when the city was at the apex of its power in the frontier, having pacified the Chendhyan tribes on their borders and even occupied Caergaraen. With few enemies, and a good relationship with their overlord Ameion, Rakkabuttai was beginning to fall prey to moral degradation and corruption, as the Brotherhood began to care more about enriching themselves than their stated mission.\n\nTessenades, the Grandmaster of the Brotherhood, promulgated a code of unbreakable laws that clamped down on this growing corruption, and began to set the order on the “true path” again. While the winds of change would see that Rakkabuttai would eventually fall from power, Tessenades ensured that the Brotherhood would face their fall as the stalwart military force they were founded as, rather than simple armoured bandits. Even in exile, after their city was destroyed by a resurgent Caergaraen, they would not forget what they were born to do."

However, all was not well, as a political struggle erupted between the “Purple Faction”, who believed that they should grow closer to their northern neighbour, the Kingdom of Dumrusvarn, and the “White Faction”, led by Princess Taneliata, who believed that they should maintain their independence at any cost. Eventually, this culminated in a short but violent civil war within the walls of the city which resulted in the exodus of the White Faction.\n\nAfter being turned away at every other port on the southern coast, and finally arriving at the mouth of the Donzaern river, Taneliata wasted no time establishing a safe harbour for the remains of her fleet – a harbour that would quickly be used to retrofit their shoddy merchant vessels for war, as the victorious Purples were soon sailing towards them, intent on snuffing out the last embers of their political rivals. However, Taneliata’s naval aptitude and fierce leadership led the soon-to-be-Oremvandians to a shock victory, allowing the newly established “Whiteharbour” to bloom into the shining city it is today."

To secure Oremvand’s future, Taneliata conducted the second of her great feats, as she approached Taelarix of Zaernouh with an enticing offer – in return for a guarantee of peace, and a share of the city’s profits, no man or woman of Chendhya would live in bondage within Oremvand’s walls. Taelarix, dreaming of the riches that could be gained from this partnership, quickly accepted, and Oremvand gained the “Chendhyan Edge” that has been its sword and shield for so long.\n\nAfter the fall of the First Gophiran Empire, Oremvand would take the many Chendhyans fleeing the destruction of their remnant kingdoms in Taychend, fashioning them into a vast mercenary army that would storm over Thekvrystan. Finally destroying their rival Nagar Vyechei, they established the “Oremvand Valiyavam”, or Oremvandian Hegemony, that would claim dominion over the southern coast for over a hundred years."

The Thekvrystana gradually – and nearly completely – evolved into a Kheionized Kleyeren class, as the Chendhyans increasingly turned to an Astolbhen identity under Kheionai employ, and the Yodhan slavers of the city turned away from it as Ameion itself turned away from the practice, being replaced by Ambhen migrants."

Though nearly destroyed amidst the fall of their first empire, the Sangamar Kings reconsolidated and reformed their realm and, more importantly, their military, establishing the Ironblood Army, one of the greatest infantry armies Taychend had ever seen. It was only a matter of time before these two powers would come to blows, as a trade-deal-turned-sour ballooned into a diplomatic conflict that would lead to the First Oremvandian War. Though Oremvand would win, temporarily halting Gophiran expansion, it would not be even 20 years before Gophira gathered the strength to go on the offensive once more.\n\nThe Second and Third Oremvandian Wars were cataclysmic conflicts, as Oremvand and Gophira struggled over control of the south. Oremvand was forced to adapt and innovate in order to avoid destruction, with pay, leadership and organisational reforms greatly expanding the size of their mercenary army.

 J70_reputation_for_riches_desc: "Taychendi mercenary culture has always included the latent desire to betray, murder, and usurp one’s own employers. In order to avoid such a fate, the rulers and traders of Oremvand have long had a policy to give the highest rewards possible to the mercenaries they hire – regular pay, prime looting rights, even land of their own to farm or mine, or else political positions overseeing newly conquered territory. This policy has worked well to placate the mercenaries under Oremvand’s employ, and the city’s reputation for riches has also helped entice soldiers of fortune from across Taychend towards the wealth of the Whiteharbour."

Needless to say, the harbours and docklands of Oremvand are filled with eager and experienced sailors, their skills honed from a lifetime at sea."

Here they trade the riches of their islands for metals from the iron forests and luxuries that have made their way south from Fangaula and Kheterata. These they resell to their wealthier bretheren in Fahvanosy, and while the riches are not as abundant as those to be had trading with the lizardfolk or Horashesh to the east, the long history of good relations with the tribes of Dao Nako ensures the trade is regular, stable, and lucrative."

This fusion of cultures resulted in a highly permissive society, where various cultural norms were accepted in the interest of ensuring peace was kept between the different groups now living on the islands. This attitude would also prove useful for Mpirelmasi merchants, who were largely open-minded and willing to trade with anyone as long as they had coin."

Unfortunately, as merchant vessels are oft laden with cargo, it can be difficult to outrun marauders outfitted to plunder instead of trade legitimately. Vessels from Mpirelmasi were accutely aware of this problem, and made multiple compromises in their ship design to increase speed, even at the cost of cargo space, to enable them to slip away from hostile vessels and return home safely."

Returning home, however, is always far more difficult, requiring vessels to tack into the wind or row along the coastline as they fight the currents of wind and water. In stormy conditions this is nearly impossible to do so - and in one instance in 1561, a great hurricane swept a trading ship from Mpirelmasi far to the west. After drifting for a week, land was sighted - but it was not Fahvanosy. No, this was a new island, unknown to the islanders, that offered a new home. The discovery of these western lands triggered great interest in Mpirelmasi, but soon others would find and establish settlements here - folk from far to the north, some of whom looked very much like us..."

Everything but our songs that our shamans sing of a past when we had everything as we toll away on fields and battlefields. But as time marches on and the constant changing of their homes by the orders of the command their songs started to spread out towards other slaves, one of the few things that elevates the spirits of the enslaved, “In the end they all lift together”, no matter the race, size or standing.

These horns served as one of the few reminders of their lives before they were tragically enslaved by the command.\n\nIn the present day, these instruments have evolved much like the orcs themselves. Originating as rudimentary tools, the horns were refined, trained, and intricately carved into efficient and flawless implements of war. They produce a diverse range of tones, conveying precise commands and orders to the orcish ears, while also generating a deafening and intimidating effect on any foe standing before them.

Their lives resumed their normal rhythm, a period of respite before they once again labored in the fields, honed their weapons, mended the horns, and restored the land.\n\nEach task had its own melody, and every facet of their existence had a unique song. Much like the music of Haless with its gradual crescendo, the brown orcs, too, followed a similar pattern as they recuperated, rested, and mended. They pieced together their melodies once more, gradually building up their strength before the moment arrived when they would once again echo across the battlefield with their horns in a renewed crescendo. A sequence of anticipation, a climax, and a conclusion – all waiting to be played out once more."

Masters of ancient lore and speakers of their own secret tongue, this decline was reversedwith the arrival of the elves. The now mixed group revitalized, with many of the newcomers joining their ranks and elven magic widening their horizons. Protecting their forest with lightning storms, wild beasts and trees coming to life made them feared, yet their helping Ilvandet in times of need was what made them loved, revered and influential. Conjuring storms in years of droughts and helping crops grow strong gave the druids a special seat at the council in Ilvandet, being among the closest confidants of the count in matters of both lore and the arcane and displacing other mages... to the Magisterium's disgust."

An aspirant to helmsman of the Lunatein, his goals in life changed completely when the Remnant Fleet arrived at Anbenncóst, joining the first company of elves sent alongside Damerian troops to defend from the Black Castanorian invasion of Lencenor. He fell in love with this new forested land, meeting the druids and learning from the forest itself as the League of Free Realms prepared to defend Carneter. It was at the Battle of the Deruwren, the farthest Castanorian attack into the Western Dameshead, that Thalanor was struck in the chest by a well-aimed javelin as the combined company of elves and men he led won the field. Ever since that day, the northern Deruwren came to be known as Ilvandet: the first elven death, and years later the local half-elves became the Grave Guardians: armed with great axes and dressed in the grey colour of grave-tree bark, with druids in their ranks. Even after melee weapons became outdated, they stayed as keepers of Thalanor's grave-forest and his legacy."

The first proper Dirandatéin took place the day of the wedding of Count Lucius of Deruwren and Imariel Woodslover the 9th of Halament of 1012, where the elven and human guests combined their traditions into one wonderful celebration. Dances and songs are shared around the fire for a whole day until the sun sets and the count or countess together with their spouse and a priestess of Falah bless the coming summer from the very same hill where the wedding took place.

Count Lucius of Deruwren, grandson of Sulgen, met Thalanor Woodslover's sister Imariel at a ceremony honouring the fallen ten years after the battle of Deruwren, forming a friendship that would grow into a marriage and the foundation of House síl Ilvan.

Many of these elves and others who settled there afterward took human wives and combined their own crafts with local Carnetori traditions, and soon the quality of Ilvandeti rope, draperies, and statues of gravetree wood gained fame across both the Kingdom of Dameria and later the Empire of Anbennar. The wooden statues became particularly valuable for nobles and burghers alike: the various shades of grey wood do not age after being worked by the Ilvandeti, and so they last as long as stone.

The tales of magical abilities and the taking of the souls of those they killed in defence of their forests did not stop the hunters of old, for their scales are said to deflect magic and be as strong as the best Dwarven steel. While sightings were once common (according to local tradition) no recent adventurer or chronicler has been able to prove their existence. Many in the Order of Chroniclers believe the forests of Ilvandet to be their last refuge, yet the druids will not let them investigate. Whether this claim is true or not, hunting has always been a prestigious and popular occupation in Ilvandet which many attribute to many hunters arriving at the forest following tales and staying in the area, with kids learning to use bows and spears at a young age."

Tending to this sapling rooted right on top of their chest so they may live again through their tree, these “groves of death” are tended by the druids of the forest and the families of the deceased, with the illness or death of an ancestor’s gravetree being a dark omen for the local family in question. Even the corpses of their enemies are given this mercy, so they may live a new life serving the land they fought against, and it is not rare for Ilvandetis living out of their homeland to send their bodies back to the forest when they die, so they may have a proper burial."

It was popularised after Lencori humans started to mingle with the gnomes settling in the region. Those Lencori would eventually become organized under the administration of the Creek Gnomes, becoming the Iochanders. \nHowever, as the Hierarchy's influence waned while that of Lorent waxed, the Lencori increasingly outnumbered the gnomes of the region. By the end of the Lilac Wars, it was largely untouched by the carnage gripping much of the rest of Cannor, and many refugees moved to the duchy.

In addition, the 1399 occupation of Ronroy by the elven necromancer Alarawel with her army of undead and her subsequent defeat led to Ronroy's destruction and the movement of the duchy's capital to its current location, renamed to Southroy.

Humans, with their short lifespans, often think in the immediate term, while gnomes, with their long lifespans, have the luxury of waiting decades for their plans to come to fruition. Due to frequent contact, Southroyer humans have been able to shift to this mindset as well, gaining increased perspective on issues when compared to other humans, which gives their plans proper time to breathe. \nFor instance, a set of land reforms reorganising Southroy's farms over the course of a century paid off during the Lilac Wars, as the duchy was spared from much of the impact of famine gripping Lencenor."

Ducal authority was efficient, and this allowed the duchy to punch above its weight against other regions within Iochand and Lorent. \nA source of prosperity for the land, the policy of Direct Ducal rule would stand until the death of the last síl Southroy in 1349, when the Duchy passed directly to the King of Lorent. The memory of ducal rule lives on, and Southroy is seen as an area that should forever stay united in authority, and not be split among squabbling small lords. "
