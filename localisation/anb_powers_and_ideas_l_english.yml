Upon finally returning home, she unified the Gerudian tribes of Konungrhavn, Sidaett and Revrhavn against the troll threat that had invaded their lands from the Dalrfjall.

And in turn, the vast quantities of the metal that the dwarves retrieved from the depths of the mountains threatened the stability of the nation's treasury. To create some relative stability, the council of clans had a massive vault constructed, where all the gold that was mined would be stored. Then they created a new institution, that of the Vault Magistrates. It was their job to carefully measure the quantities of gold in the vault and to always track the stores.

The King's Gate faces the Dwarovar. It was opened rarely during the time when the mountains were overrun by goblins and orcs, but as the Dwarovar was reclaimed by dwarves they were open more often than not. The gate is decorated with depictions of dwarven craftsmanship and great feats of engineering. The Miner's Gate faces the underneath.

The Runefather and his followers found themselves banished into the Underdeeps; what should have been a proverbial death sentence was instead weathered during the Harrowing Times through the Runefather's guidance. It was during this time that the Runefather, beset by a spiritual malaise, gave in to the rancor and bitterness of his followers.

This state of near constant war gave rise to a unique culture amongst the dwarven holds where sacrifice and skill are valued above bloodline, where the good of the hold was held above that of empire. The outcasts of the empire gave more for the survival of their hold than any other dwarf in the Empire, be that in the form of gold or the sacrifice of one’s life.

Due to being founded by exiles and criminals, Krakdhûmvror had very few strong clans at the time of its founding. As such, unlike the rigid hierarchy of the other holds, Krakdhûmvror has held talent in a higher regard than bloodline or clan. As a result talent is far more likely to rise to the top in the northern hold and nepotism is considered all but sacrilegious in the frozen halls of power. Thus Krakdhûmvror had enjoyed an innovative and flexible administration for much of its existence. Many a time did a disgraced scion of a noble imperial house flee to Krakdhûmvror demanding status and position based on little more than their parentage and all were told the same thing 'Zaru ubr Bloth', Skill over Blood."

This particular style of architecture is known as “Orv Zana” or “Cold Stone” and exists only within the realms of the Quartz Dwarves. There is little in the way of pomp and circumstance in the halls of the frozen hold. This is not without purpose; every building in Krakdhûmvror is dedicated to the singular purpose of defence and survival. Even the smallest hovel is all but a fortress unto itself.

But the world has changed and the hold must change with it.

It was common practice to banish criminals there to man the battlements and give their lives in defence of the Empire.

In the eyes of the rulers of Krakdhûmvror this left far too much to chance, especially when it came to the defence of the hold. As such in 1523 The Rite of Cold Iron, a rigorous examination that every dwarf seeking to join the military must take prior to being accepted, was created. This rite would later evolve into what was one of the first examples of a dedicated officer academy in all of Cannor, accepting any who had the aptitude to pass the rite."

Because of our reputation for fair deals, these so-called 'early payments' became commonplace, and were often overseen by Belgar, who got a small cut.

This waterfall was fed by an underground spring which was the source of a river, and it took many years of labour to originally construct it. Ever since the fall of the hold, the waterfall had been in disrepair which resulted in flooding of the hallways. Following the refounding, it took even more effort to pump out the water and to fix the waterfall than it had taken to build it - but the dwarves prevailed."

When they marched to war, they were led by dedicated marching bands which greatly inspired the troops and improved their organization. The new generation of Cobalt dwarves resurrected this ancient tradition, and soon the trumpets rang at the gates of Orlghelovar once more."

Soon enough, Orlghelovar would become famed for its optical instruments, its telescopes and lenses and prisms and more. Eventually, during the Age of Artificers, they discovered they could use mirrors and glass to concentrate the power of Damesear into a powerful beam of light capable of cutting and even burning. This led to a revolution in technology for the hold, and by the 1900s, would create weapons of mass destruction."

Many of the peoples who borders the Deepwoods still have folk stories warning children that if they misbehave then the fey-folk will steal them away in their sleep.

His clan sacked Bladekeep and the dreadful howls they performed during the pillage had given them their name. The Blackmoon Clan on the other side was famous for their battle shamans, who unleashed their magical power on the armies of humans and dwarves. The Silentblade Clan was considered somewhat dishonorable by other orcs, but they excelled in guerrilla combat, using ambushes to defeat their foes.

Their skin is now as hard as bark and provides great defence from regular weapons and firearms, while the inherent orcish trength was pushed even further, making them as strong as ogres. All these gifts were given to help orcs crush the human and orc realms in Cannor and plant a new Deepwoods in their place. It is our desire that the World Tree may be revived and, hopefully, emerald orcs will be accepted as full-fledged fey and be allowed to enter the Feyrealm, the Plane of Life and Magic, where fey hold their eternal feasts."

After that an enraged Bron challenged his father to duel for the title of high shaman and murdered him without hesitation. He assembled all uncorrupted shamans and collectively they used their magecraft to create the Black Hearth which turned the tides of war in their favor.

In Vanrahar they put the youngest most aggressive males in the front line, when it's their turn they will quickly charge their enemies with the unbound ferocity of youth.

As such, the cities always lay behind massive walls in order to keep them secure. By the 1600s, however, this situation became unfeasible, as the cities’ inhabitants pressed against the walls, and the cities ran out of room. This led to several vast construction projects throughout the region, as old walls were demolished, and new ones were constructed several dozen attilambi away.

And for each one of those merchants, every deal they struck, every good they sold, every coin that fell into their pockets, all of that wealth would return with them back up the Kharunyana, and only make the porcelain cities wealthier yet."

The province of Crathánor had few nobles yet many merchants, and thus had few representatives in the government. This meant that the Crathánori had no power to stop the Re'uyeli nobles from placing heavy tax burdens on them.\n\nAs a result, the merchants began agitating for independence. In 1421 they delivered an ultimatum to the nobility: Give us fair representation, or we will stop paying taxes. This was coldly rejected, and thus Crathánor seceded, adopting a condensed version of the ultimatum as its official motto. This would become the founding principle of the newborn republic."

Only when the dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr came to their aid could the deadlock be broken. But just as the tide had turned, the goblin invasions began in 1423.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the untrained militia fought many desperate battles, winning some and losing many.

Crathánor would prosper greatly as a result and reach the zenith of its power.\n\nBut eventually, the sun must set, as the day cannot last forever. So too did Crathánor's independence come to an inevitable end in 1658. In the dark years that followed, the Crathánori patiently waited for the sun to rise again."

It was originally tasked with guarding the eastern border of the Kingdom of Dameria. Its knights were renowned lancers and participated in many tourneys and battles throughout the centuries, their fearsome charges shattering lines of infantry with ease.\n\nEver since the formation of Anbennar, the Order's status and importance diminished. The long years of peace in Anbennar meant that fewer and fewer knights joined it. Yet the Order served Dameria faithfully until the Lilac Wars. During that conflict, Vincen II síl Cestir, the Duke of Cestirande and Grandmaster of the Order, declared independence from Dameria and joined the Rose Party. In 1444 Lilac Wars were over and the Order was on the winning side, but only thanks to their betrayal of Dameria."

And lastly, they were among the fiercest supporters of the House of Silmuna, but nevertheless sided with the Rose Party in the Fourth Lilac War.

Perhaps the most infamous such insult was recorded during the Battle of the Moon Council, when Duke Vincen II síl Cestir called Adénn "Skylance" Silmuna "Brokenlance of the Waning Moon".

But opposing them were the Vernmen of Galeinn, who shared their ambition. This rivalry lasted for countless years and showed no signs of stopping after the Lilac Wars.

The Cestirander breed was versatile, sharing traits of both cold-blooded and warm-blooded horses. The Knights of the Long Lance rode on them during tourneys and battles while farmers used them as work horses. As the importance of cavalry on the battlefield diminished, the latter role would become increasingly important, and the horses were crossbred with cold-blooded ones to make them better draft animals. The Cestirander horses would become the engine of local production, plowing fields and hauling freight."

Yet they continued to diminish as technology developed and made lancers obsolete. Members of the order became little more than titleholders or low-ranking officers in the army.\n\nEventually, however, the Order did have its resurgence. The Dukes and Duchesses of Cestirande began to grant the title of knight to court officials and bureaucrats as a reward for exemplary service. This new generation of knights did not wield the lance, but the pen. The burgeoining paper industry of the Duchy's capital, Cestaire, grew to primarily fuel these new knights and their numerous writings."

Facing total annihilation from his experienced sun elven legions and countless auxiliaries, Shanyutian did the unthinkable. With a simple order, the precious dikes and levees that held back the destructive power of water were broken, unleashing a torrent. Merging with streams from other broken levees, the torrent quickly became a flood, a deluge, and finally, a frothing wall of water, turned brown with mud and rocks.\n\nWhat remained of Jaher’s first invasion forces were scattered, forced to trudge back through the broken and flooded remnants of rice paddies and fields.The generals of Shanyutian always have this tactic in the back of their minds, no matter how self-destructive it may be. For better to have to rebuild than suffer under the yoke of another."

Harimar returned home embarassed for amassing such a great host. They defeated any army they came across, and stole what meagre riches the land had.

To charge downhill, through fire and flame, and to clash with a foe that outnumbered you ten to one, was to be the last act of bravery... but Castellos saw otherise. And during the Castanite charge, what did Castellos do? He appeared in the form of a Silver Dragon and blew the demonflame back at the gnolls, decisively altering the fate of mankind! Men of Castanor, be bold, for your arms will not fail you! Men of Castanor, hold your swords high, for we charge in the name of Castan and the Battle of the Burning Hill!

Out of silver and mithril, in one year of work, our best smiths forged a huge majestic crown. At the base, shining brightly, is a circlet sculpted to depict the White Walls. Surmounting each tower of the circlet are statues of the gods of the Cannorian Pantheon, encrusted with innumerable jewels. At the center, linked to the interior of the wall by bands of metal, lies an astonishingly accurate representation of Trialmount, topped with a huge diamond! But that is not all, as there are actually two different parts in this masterpiece! Our smiths forged a splendid miniature dragon, and the most talented enchanter of our realm created an invisible magic link between the two parts, so that the dragon can levitate atop the crown!

In a stark contrast to us, Bostynn has always been the home of fierce, outright obstinate people, who jumped at every opportunity to revolt, forming impromptu bands of peasant warriors who ransacked the countryside until the Imperial army would inevitably arrive to put them down. The “Bridge-Wardens” were experienced hunters who frequently put themselves at the head of those revolts and, when not busy leading, constituted the best archers available north of Arverynn.

Let it be known henceforth, that sharing any idea or even mentioning any of the forms of government or customs used by Cannorian barbarians, even just for academical purposes, is a subversive maneuver that calls for the most severe punishments."

 G27_endurance_desc:0 "Life on the steep slopes of the Vels Argan mountains makes for a hardy people, who can easily endure a forced march or two through harsh terrain, wearing light iron armours that protect the chest and thighs while leaving the joints free to move. Brelari warriors have always been noted for their stamina, and they played a vital role in the rise of the ancient Kingdom of Vareynn when in 312, during the battle of Drevonbost, together with Vareynn's soldiers they surrounded the larger Malacnari host and eventually wore them down to the last fighter."

The river runs strong and great for as far as the eye can see, and the landscape is dotted by watermills that people built throughout the ages to harness a portion of its strength. The modern town of Brelar itself originates from a village built around a water-powered lumber mill, but of course no mere watermill can compare to the Great Ynnic Dams, built by master engineers of old who tragically lost their lives during the collapse of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nFortunately for us, some of them were miraculously escorted to safety here in Brelar, where their descendants live to this day, and it is with their help that we will complete our newest project: we will upgrade Brelar's watermill, to be made huge and out of gold, bringing prestige and respect to what is the symbol of our nation, as well as a crucial source of energy."

They passed many reforms in the administrative field, resizing the provinces to account for the shifts in fertility of the Ynn River, rooting out corrupt officers, standardizing the calendar and formalizing the distinction between central and provincial government. While the empire would erupt into a civil war between Sarda and Dolindhans fifty years later in 896 and begin its slow decline, none could say that it was Brelar's fault."

While there is historical evidence for an ancient group of spies and assassins who protected the Ynnic emperors and were based off the village of Brelarico, rumours that they have continued their operations to this day and are now serving the Brelari state are just that - a rumour."

Grebniesth acted quick to call upon the aid of its neighbours: by appealing to their sense of honour and underlining the risks that a Rzentur invasion would bring to all of them, while also leveraging on decades of built-up amicality, we convinced the majority of Dolindha to act as one in the face of the Great Heathen Host.

Riding a stockier northern breed and being experts of the terrain, the Grebvitre dutifully patrol the Nisargan border for any barbarian who would be as foolhardy as to approach.

The states of Svemel, Pomvasonn and Juzondezan are a result of such migrations, being Rzentur realms on what was once Dolindhan land. Before any more Rzentur, new or old, gets the idea to invade us, we should act preemptively: many Old Rzentur tribes would like nothing more than to settle the lands of their cousins to the south, and some of our "traders" will make sure to provide them with the motivations and means to do so."

It was King Komerjon of Vareynn who slew King Vatrevid of Malacnar in personal combat and claimed the City of Warriors for himself, and through his successors Vareynn expanded to rule all the lands along the Ynn River, forging the Ynnic Empire spanning from Svemel the High City to Adbrabohvi by the End of the World."

In order to vanquish evil, and trample all those who would question his rule, he struck a pact with the feral antler horses of the Dolindhan forests, becoming Rogaispodhan - the Antler Lord, the first elf who was allowed to ride them. While Dolindhan horses have since become far more manageable and tamer through centuries of domestication, still today it is said that if a knight has a particular connection and affinity with his horse, he has "the Blood of Lukaus", and nowhere is the blood of Lukaus still as present as in Vareynn’s nobility."

While the Amethyst Knights of Amacimst are the ones who came closest to succeeding, they are but one of the many names we've heard. In order to keep up with this stream of challengers, mandatory training sessions will be scheduled, where our knights will be brought up to date with the latest fencing techniques, riding formations, and fighting tactics of the enemies. While improving their individual prowess, these exercises will also have the side effect of teaching them to trust their generals and readily follow orders."

 G31_harbingers_of_honour_desc:0 "The Ynnic Empire wasn’t forged only through fire and bloodshed. Some states, such as Brelar, joined Vareynn willingly, while others, like Stanyrhrada, were inherited through royal marriage. When King Komerjon annexed Malacnar, he cited how the Malacnari followed the strongest, which he had proven himself to be by slaying their king. When King Jeborad crossed the Ynn at Vels Bacar to conquer southward, he did so coming to the aid of his allies in Stanyrhrada. Through the centuries, Vareynn gained a reputation as a just if firm ruler, and its citizens set the standard for what it meant to be honourable and civilized, a standard which lives on through the knightly virtue of today."

Originally built as a fortified military encampment, it was under the care of the Drevondarant dynasty - a cadet branch of the Imperial family - that it was restructured to be a permanent residence for the nobility. While it was able to host many jousts and feasts throughout the ages, gathering nobles from all the Ynn, the castle also withstood many periods of hardships, both financially and militarily, and thus its keepers learned to make the best with whatever limited resources they had."

 G31_legacy_of_king_emperor_joanseln_desc:0 "Ancient Vareynn was ruled with the help of an assembly of riders, originally meant to allow those too elderly to ride in battle to continue assisting the kingdom by providing the ruler with regency and advice. Over time the Assembly of Riders schemed to gain more and more power, even obtaining the ability to veto the King’s decisions and resolve on matters of state independently.\n\nIt was King Joanseln yen Dolin who, in the seventh century After Flood, saw to it that the assembly was limited back to its advisory role and proclaimed himself the absolute Emperor of the Ynn, and while he was assassinated only a year later, his daughter finished the job and put all conspirators to death in a most gruesome fashion.

The hippodrome was thus left half-built, and to this day it remains as a stain on the city’s pride, with both the hippodrome and Vareynn being left in disrepair. No more!

In West Tipney he became known as Deer-Trotter, for his elegant antler horse, while in Havoral he earned the name of Treewrath, for the way he once wiped out a fort occupied by bandits only by shooting sticks and branches.\n\nWhen his home country became embroiled in the War of the Bacaran Succession, Erandil rode home to assist the fight first-hand, and trained a new generation of archers. In his final days he ventured to the world below the Cliffs of Ruin, meeting the Aelnari elves and posing as a Star Elf sailor aboard the Aelnari flagship. One day, the body of Aelnar’s admiral was found dead in his cabin riddled with Trompolere’s poison arrows, and Erandil had fled leaking Aelnar’s plans for an invasion of the Trollsbay."

Particularly fruitful was the trade of lamp oil and ropes made from the fat and leather of mighty Dolindhan animals, and bombs, the manufacturing of which saw a small boom in the Bridge-Town of Bosancovac.

However, he was ultimately executed by Emperor Calrodiy II for failing to extend the lifespan of the ailing emperor, and many of his discoveries were then banned from publication.

Other authors have chosen to ignore the matter of the Ending Flood completely, focusing instead on Arkanvyr’s bravery and ingenuity in the face of unknown monsters and hardships, a bravery which has inspired many a Ynnic knight to do great deeds such as the slaying of the Rzentur dragon."

Rather than competing for championship, the Knights Oathkeeper have thus decided to serve as law-enforcement, flying their white banners and drapes across the forested countryside as they deter any aspiring brigant and rabble-rouser from disturbing the peace. And while other knights may mock this relatively placid lifestyle, isn’t peace what all true warriors strive for?\n\nIn 1721, at the Battle of Delanydon Crossing, the Knights Oathkeeper finally took up arms yet again - but not the arms everyone expected, for they began unleashing deadly volleys of pistol fire upon the enemy lines before their charge, in a devastating combination of Tellumtiri gunmanship and Ynnic chivalry."

In recent times, the conflict with Ovdal Kanzad has grown into a full blown war. Goblin armies have needed to learn how to fight against the guns of the dwarves, taking heavy casualties to win the battles needed to protect their homes. But goblins are a clever race. With each battle, they have learned more of how to protect themselves from the Dwarvish artillery. More of how to treat the wounded so that they may fight again rather than succumb to disease or injury.

Aside from being an immensely powerful mage, Dak was also a brilliant administrator and general. In the early days of his rule, He brought the Chaingrasper clan to fully dominate the other clans within the hold of Ovdal-az-An and expanded the clan’s influence to surrounding sections of the Dwarovar. Beyond his military achievements, Dak also implemented a complex system of administration. His influence, and thus his greatness, runs to the very core of what the Chaingrasper Clan is today."

This kind of control in goblin society can only be maintained via careful balancing and ensuring that powerful goblins feel they have a measure of control. This is accomplished in Chaingrasper via the Council of the Stone, an assembly of goblins who by virtue of wealth, influence, or ruthlessness have earned the ear of our clanboss.

 H74_the_battleaxe_manifesto:0 "The Battleaxe Manifesto"
 H74_the_battleaxe_manifesto_desc:0 "Written by the reitred soldier Dakez Orangebelt, the Battleaxe Manifesto was a radical political work that called for the organization of goblin society on highly militaristic and authoritarian lines. According to Dakez, the Hobgoblins had been goblins on the path to an ideal society but had failed by corrupting their bodies with a mystic substance that he calls animu. The book makes the rather fanciful claim that ancient goblins had once had such a society as the book argued for and had ruled over all the humans of Rahen as an empire called the Reykh. Orangebelt ends the book by calling for an invasion of Rahen to create a second Reykh. Widely derided by historians and archaeologists, the book found a surprising popularity among the rising middle and lower classes who had borne the brunt of long wars against the command, as well as a leadership looking to match the soldiers of the hobgoblins. Widespread support for militarism would lead to major military improvements in Chaingrasper armies."

And both their rules ended there. The great tiger disappeared after entering the inner sanctum of the great temple, while the elven conqueror was assassinated by the displeased Yansheni rulers.

#  I19_the_military_hall_desc:0 "In the days of the Aul-Dwarov, Ovdal-az-An was the headquarters of the dwarven military in the east, marshalling troops from throughout the Dwarovar to smite the goblin hordes in the caves. As the threat of the goblins diminished, Ovdal-az-An remained an important part of Aul Dwarov’s military infrastructure, holding the most prestigious military academies in the Dwarovar. The hold maintained this tradition even in the days of the fall of the Dwarovar, with its walls scarred by the battle between its last cadet class and the orcish horde that finally destroyed it. We shall honour these fallen heroes by restoring the military academies and carrying on the legacy of our hold."

#  I19_intelligence_wins_wars_desc:0 "Despite the military might of the hold Ovdal-az-An once fell to the orcs, dooming the dwarves who dwelt there at the time. THis was not for lack of military prowess. Nor of spare siege supplies. The issue lay in something far more severe. Ovdal-az-An had the finest army in the east, and had easily defeated all orcs and goblins that had assaulted the hold. So when Gronstunad came under threat, the king of Ovdal-az-An marched to its defense, leaving only a token force to defend the hold. Alas, in pursuit of military excellence, the granite dwarves of old had neglected the necessity of gathering good information. Merely two days into their journey, the forces of Ovdal-az-An were destroyed in a massive ambush laid by orcish warlords. What few survivors escaped the slaughter arrived home just in time to witness the Orc shamans tearing down the gates. Such was the valour of Granite Dwarves, that they lasted for four more years of battle, enough time to make a chronicle of their fate and to exact a bloody toll. We shall not make the same mistakes."

A tough and hardy bread that can last for years without rotting or going stale, granitebread not only stays edible in the worst of circumstances, but also strengthens the jaw muscles of those who consume it, thanks to its hard consistency. Considered a delicacy in Ovdal-az-An, usually reserved for the nobility and military outside of feast days, granitebread has oddly not caught on in popularity among the non-military members of other dwarf holds. Still, the soldiers of other holds oft show their appreciation for their supply of the delicacy when serving alongside Granite Dwarf Soldiers. During joint military endeavors, it is common to hear stories of dwarven brotherhood where other dwarves will offer our Granite Dwarf soldiers their granitebread in exchange for the worst of the food, like meat and mushroom pies. Truly we are appreciated for our contribution to dwarf cuisine."

A common dwarf in the army of Ovdal-az-An, his valor on the battlefield would win him a place in the cadet class of 1667. After graduation, he suffered a grievous injury from a near miss by artillery during a battle with hobgoblins. Bedridden and given a prognosis of only a few year to live, Norin set about writing a great treatise on the art of modern warfare. After his death, the manuscript ended up in the hands of his old teacher. Astounded by Norin’s insights, the book ‘Norin’s Codex on Military Matters’ would become a core part of the curriculum of every future class of the Ovdal-az-An military academy, and of military education throughout the world."
