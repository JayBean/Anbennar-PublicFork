For this reason it is important that if magic is used soil is given an appropriate recovery period where plants are allowed to grow without the assistance of magics.' -The Comprehensive Guide to Magicks\n\nThe laws of Magic are well written. This, however, does not mean they are respected.\n\nStarting in 1620, Eilísin began expanding their policy of mages assisting wine production, through the use of spells, in order to meet the growing demand for Eilísin Tríros, disregarding these well recorded laws of magic. To the despair of the rulers of Eilísin the increased usage of magic did not increased crop yields in the long term, seemingly having the opposite effect. In order to remedy this state mages, and even rulers, went down unnatural paths to restore the fertility of the soil and meet the ever-growing market, to keep the profits flowing.\n\nDuring the reign of Rewan IV there were many instances of bodies of plantation workers being found, their life force drained.

But Paol was slain during an ambush by soldiers of the Sorcerer King around Rosefield in the year 998.\n\nThe death of his Knight and close friend sent Maugun into a deep depression, and he deserted. Distraught, and unwilling to return home for the shame of having deserted, he wandered the Rewanwoods aimlessly. During this period he encountered the most beautiful creature he’d ever seen: a Unicorn. With a new purpose in life Maugun set about catching the beast. He stalked the Unicorn for a year before he caught it, and during the process he learnt many things about the forest (and killed many invaders that interrupted his quest).\n\nBlessed with his new mount, and a refocused purpose, Maugun returned to his home of High Ording. He found it in flames. Without a moment's hesitation Maugan flew toward the besieged town, barely dodging a fireball thrown his way by a marauding mage. Moving fast so as to avoid a second fireball Maugan sped toward the man, killing him in a single strike. Fortunately, the raiding force was a small one, and with the help of a few volunteers they were easily routed.\n\nIn the following year Maugun fought hard to defend his home. His valiant bravery made him popular with the locals, who coined the name “Maugun the Unicorn Knight”, and he even befriended Rewan Lorentis, the King of Lorent, who created for him the Duchy of Great Ording. In all the centuries since, every Great Ordinger has aspired to his levels of bravery and devotion — and some even believe that if they can fully match him, a unicorn shall appear unto them as well."

The lead designer of the renovation, Teagan of Freecestir, was struck with an idea upon seeing the behemoth banners; a way to not only incorporate them into the Castle, but to create a new array of defenses. Every section of wall was covered in banners, with very little space between them or the ground.

But following some incident (the details are unclear) shortly after he turned 25, he was all-but-exiled from the land of his birth, and he headed east to find better fortunes in the foreign realm called Castanor.\n\nHe found a place tending to Castan V the Great's wolf-hounds, whose lineage ran back to those that had hunted down fey and centaur alongside Castan II Beastbane. Though a lowly kennel assistant, he struck up a friendship with the Castan, whose favourite past-time was hunting with his canine companions, and deeply appreciated their beauty and vigor.\n\nWhen the Castan marched on the Alenic Frontier, seeking to subjugate that unruly people, Clothar accompanied him as assistant and retainer, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Legion II Vertesk. When the wars came to a conclusion, Castan the Great granted him a large swathe of land (including Derwing), elevating him as a 'civilized' and 'domesticated' Alenic.\n\nThe Lord Derwing, Ruler of the Lower Alen under Castanor, would serve well for roughly two decades more, keeping his vassals at bay (though they despised him) and visiting Castanor every year or two to make personal reports to the Castan. But following his death to a bone cancer, much of his land refused to pay his successors any fealty whatsoever — they were denigrated as 'sons of a bitch, the lot of 'em' — and most lands beyond Derwing itself were lost.\n\nThis is our legacy, well-earned by service and never revoked from the family of Derwing. We shall make this truth clear to any and all pretenders."

Just outfitting for an expedition might cost a hefty chunk of the quest's potential profits, in terms of potions purchased and armor repairs.\n\nBut the ruinborn, ah the ruinborn... They will pay vast sums for shoddy muskets, and give away for almost-free magical reagents that artificers and sorcerors will pay trunks full of crowns for.

But the first two Fundamental Truths to life is that we all live in One World, and are created by One God, and so Varil did not stop there. By 1631, almost every Busilari ship engaged in the Kingdom's prodigious Sarhaly and Halessi trade would carry with it an array of new inventions along with a missionary who would use them to spread the teachings of the One God. In trading ports across Halann, in the wake of a Busilari trade fleet's visit, small communities of Ravelian adherents would undoubtedly spring up."

And long sat in that cities shadow, being a mere blip under Adshaw — for better and for worse.\n\nDuring the Age of Black Ice, Bayvic was a prominent raiding target, while few if any Reavers even knew of Dinesck, let alone sought its loot. Under Adshaw Dinesk was nothing more than a mere momentary pause for dignitaries journeying to Bayvic. After Gawed turned its hungry eyes north but was solidly rebuffed by Bayvic in fierce fighting, they finally noticed Dinesck, saw the opportunity for a consolation prize, and the city wound up all-but-razed in a sacking by frustrated Gawedi soldiers. Even when goblins rose to power in so-called Bayvek, other Reachmen assumed the same must have happened in Dinesck.\n\nThis is an insult, but also an opportunity.

And when the Reach began to industrialize in the 17th century, the entire Alenic region suddenly hungered for wood to fuel the burgeoning furnaces and proto-factories.\n\nThis was invaluable for Dinesck as it recovered from the Gawedi sack; the city hired out logging teams across the Alen, while devouring more and more of the nearby woods itself. Under the Northern League, Dinesck was instrumental in felling vast swathes of forest fill the Magnates' coffers.

But more importantly, in Dinesck, Tola used the money to build a massive palace just outside the town. But the gentry of Dinesck had long disdained the city's lower classes, and would not relinquish their sneer when one suddenly ascended far beyond their assigned status. For all the palaces' lavish rooms and abundant ballrooms, they ignored any and all of Tola's invitations, not a one stepping foot in his 'Petty Palace'.\n\nTola would live and die in that building, and his fortune enriched two generations of descendants who did the same, before his grandson died without heirs. The Palace became used for two reasons: lumber storage, and impressing visitors who did not know its background.

From its its highest building, raised by the ex-Woodsman, Guardman Captain Tomac, it was one of the first in the Reach to fly the League's dark blue flag.\n\nBut the Magnates were greedy creatures, and their factories ever needed more wood to fuel them.

Some orcs suggested that he was second Dookanson, embodying the benevolent aspect of Dookan. But most believe that he is completely separate deity, never known before to anyone, personifying liberty, unyielding will and resistance to oppression. He was never widely recognised outside our country, but that does not hinder the faith of our people in the divine nature of our first leader.\n\nThis cult has spread across Ozgarom, unifying both Orcs and Ruinborn. It has never been neither oppressed nor promoted as the state religion, but has certainly been beneficial for the stability of our nation."

Only in very tribal systems with no clear power structure was order brought by restructuring the local systems, but local chiefs still stayed in power.

In the days of the Jadd Empire their powers were extended to bypass the courts and to instantly deal with anyone who did not comply with the tenets of the faith.

The Runefather and his followers found themselves banished into the Underdeeps; what should have been a proverbial death sentence was instead weathered during the Harrowing Times through the Runefather's guidance.\n\nIt was during this time that the Runefather, beset by a spiritual malaise, gave in to the rancor and bitterness of his followers. He nurtured their nascent hatred and forged them anew into a cold, calculating weapon hellbent on righting past wrongs and achieving vengeance against those that dared to banish him; thus the Obsidian dwarves were born, fuelled by their eternal resentment."

It has stood alone for centuries against many enemies, fighting near constantly to keep those who would destroy them at bay. This state of near constant war gave rise to a unique culture amongst the dwarven holds where sacrifice and skill are valued above bloodline, where the good of the hold was held above that of empire.\n\nThe outcasts of the empire gave more for the survival of their hold than any other dwarf in the Empire, be that in the form of gold or the sacrifice of one’s life. This attitude became known as 'The Chain Bond' amongst the people of Krakdhûmvror, a chain between each member of the hold from generation to generation forged in the frozen hardship of the north."

 I02_zaru_ubr_bloth_desc:0 "'Skill over Blood' or 'Zaru ubr Bloth' has long been something of an unofficial motto of the Krakdhûmvror administration. Due to being founded by exiles and criminals, Krakdhûmvror had very few strong clans at the time of its founding. As such, unlike the rigid hierarchy of the other holds, Krakdhûmvror has held talent in a higher regard than bloodline or clan. As a result talent is far more likely to rise to the top in the northern hold and nepotism is considered all but sacrilegious in the frozen halls of power.\n\nThus Krakdhûmvror has enjoyed an innovative and flexible administration for much of its existence. Many a time did a disgraced scion of a noble imperial house flee to Krakdhûmvror demanding status and position based on little more than their parentage and all were told the same thing: 'Zaru ubr Bloth', Skill over Blood."

There is little in the way of pomp and circumstance in the halls of the frozen hold. This is not without purpose; every building in Krakdhûmvror is dedicated to the singular purpose of defence and survival. Even the smallest hovel is all but a fortress unto itself. Though other holds laughed at Krakdhûmvror’s poverty its citizens could only laugh for, as a common saying in the city goes, 'Those in gold houses often end up dead.'"

In ages past its first inhabitants were banished from the Empire and deliberately isolated from their brethren; the men and women of the hold and the fortress that preceded it had very little interest in the affairs of the outside world. But the world has changed and the hold must change with it. Proposed by Ugrim Thundersteel in 1467, the eponymous Thundersteel Commision was a concerted effort by the rulers of Krakdhûmvror to equip colonial expeditions to expand their influence outside of their hold’s walls and over the entire Giants Anvil range."

Isolated and alone in the Giants Anvil mountains it was built to be a bulwark against the Ice Giants of yore. It was common practice to banish criminals there to man the battlements and give their lives in defence of the Empire. The fortress still stands today, proud and strong, its defences expanded in the wake of Fall of the Dwarovar to accommodate the flood of refugees from Amldihr; in the aftermath of this event it would become what we know today as the Frozen Hold of Krakdhûmvror."

Talent, though rewarded, was rarely sought out and fostered, having instead relied on its citizens to come forward in times of need. In the eyes of the rulers of Krakdhûmvror this left far too much to chance, especially when it came to the defence of the hold.\n\nAs such in 1523 The Rite of Cold Iron, a rigorous examination that every dwarf seeking to join the military must take prior to being accepted, was created. This rite would later evolve into what was one of the first examples of a dedicated officer academy in all of Cannor, accepting any who had the aptitude to pass the rite."

As a young, starry-eyed man, the last king of Jorkad was said to have spent his life searching for the ritual in which he might turn our lead to gold. Soon enough, though, he was afflicted with the Hoardcurse, his goal discarded. Only his fixation on gold remained. It’s long been said that Jorkad might have held, had he not embezzled and hoarded the funds that would’ve armed our soldiers on the fateful day of the hold’s fall, or even that the orcs were sent as a punishment, for a greedy, unfit ruler whose lust for gold had spread to his people, fracturing the hold at every level."

While the meltwater from the peaks that has long fed the pipes of Jorkad was long sufficient to maintain us, the supply had nearly become insufficient. However, first simple water wheels along the river’s run, and ultimately the towering machines that constitute the inner workings of the Jorkad Dam see enough water flowing into our hold to fill pipes from Jorkad to every stretch of the Serpentspine beyond, and power to turn the gears of each and every machine that springs from the minds of our engineers."

The few remnants of Aul-Dwarov pointed fingers and squabbled until the bitter end, as the orcs swept across the enfeebled holds.

And even after Grônstunad’s fall to the hobgoblins, so too did Tuwad-Dhûmakon follow in their elder’s footsteps.\n\nWe shall see to it that our people are no longer neglected and subjugated to cater to the needs of others. Our hold is prosperous, and we’ll see to it that there’s always enough to go around. While in the latter years before our hold’s fall, Grônstunad often demanded more than we could give, our independence will ensure our people will no longer be left starving and desperate by their rulers."

While the aesthetics of our gardens are proof enough of their success, making our holds and homes some of the most beautiful in all the Serpentspine, they serve a more pragmatic function in times of war.\n\nWhile many a hold has become a tomb to its starving inhabitants in times of strife, the fungi, mosses, and light-shunning plants of our homes shall see to it that in war and peace alike, our people shall have all they need to stay strong and keep a full belly. The caverns of calcite that stretch above our hold give us all the water we’d need to see our gardens flourish.

It’s rumored that, if one were to perfectly cut an emerald to truly capture the beauty of the gem in its purest form, a link could be formed between Halanna’s soul and their own, bestowing eternal life upon them.

From their valiant efforts to save those trapped in collapsed caves, to work as simple as maintaining our renowned system of streetlamps and illumination, there’s hardly a charitable effort that’s been recorded in our nation without our finest in the order clamoring to give their full aid and support.\n\nThough these efforts are hardly without recognition, the humble dwarves of this order ask only that credit for their work be given to the Earthmother, even if dwarves across the Serpentspine long ago abandoned our old gods. The order’s piety, along with syncretism between their Regent Court traditions and our own forms of worship has transformed our theology.

One of the oldest, most renowned traditions in the history of our hold, our most prestigious and wealthy citizens find their final rest at the spire.\n\nTheir hearts are preserved in jars of alabaster, set into small divots in the rock around the great gleaming tower, the flow of the soft stone merging the jar and the stone, until the two become one mass. It is a rare honor, to lay one’s heart next to that of the Earthmother, one sought by prestigious folk from all corners of the world. It’s hardly a surprise, then, that they seem eager to stay on good terms."

In an effort to truly distinguish ourselves, and live up to these muddled accounts that surely reflect our home, in the years following the reclamation Queen Mother Dwalra Beardpath saw to it that her young son would preside over a realm that truly reflects the beauty of the Earthmother’s final gift.\n\nInstituting efforts to repair the gleaming emerald façade of our gate, alongside a mandate that a percentage of our emeralds mined must be put toward the beautification of our city. Cultivating verdant mosses and emerald-capped fungi will see to it that, foolish as it might be to build a whole city from our sacred stones, the radiant grace of Halanna shall be reflected in all we make and do."

With the beginning of the Reclamation we have found Aul-Dwarov to be radically different from what was described in the annals of our ancestors; foul beasts squat in long-abandoned holds and the once great realm lies in ruins.

Many of the peoples who borders the Deepwoods still have folk stories warning children that if they misbehave then the fey-folk will steal them away in their sleep.

His clan sacked Bladekeep and the dreadful howls they performed during the pillage had given them their name. The Blackmoon Clan on the other side was famous for their battle shamans, who unleashed their magical power on the armies of humans and dwarves.

The Sadih know this is not the case.\n\nIt is said that long ago, before the people of the Boek arrived in this land, they were united as a single tribe under a female chieftain named Imar'el. They lived as one and their bond was unbreakable.\n\nWhile it may seem that time has broken this bond, the Sadih have proven this not to be the case.

With their backs to the cliffs it was clear to the Boek that there would be no surrender, and they fought with a previously unseen ferocity. The Braves, living up to their name, charged, with disregard for their own lives, headlong into the Cannorian muskets. Refusing to give up what little they had left the Braves pushed on through the gunfire, with each Brave taking as many as 6 shots to bring down.\n\nBut it was not enough; no amount of bravery could make up for the technological disparity between the settlers and the Boek and they were slaughtered to the last.\n\nIn the end it seems the Lenef were proven correct: there is more to war than mere bravery.“ – Excerpt from The Last Stand of the Braves."

As our tribe grows however the prospect of moving our entire tribe becomes a daunting one, and so have been forced to adapt.

They cut down our scouts with the same emotionless precision as they offered the Bloodfeeders.\n\nSo it was for years, that we skirmished with these 'elves'. Though we could scarcely capture them, for the ferocity they offered, what little we could gleam was that they wished to kill all who walk upon the world, save for their own kin. So it was, for a time, our dwellings pushed from the forest that was our home, our trees aflame as we found ourselves set against this great enemy.\n\nBut we were not alone in our fight. A strange short-eared folk followed who too came from across the seas but were embroiled in battle with the elves. Whilst at first we had distrusted these people it became clear we could not stand alone and our braves joined with theirs becoming their brothers in battle, standing at our side, along with many others.

With the settlers came a new breed of Bloodfeeder, one capable of disguising itself as a person, tricking our people into following them away from the tribe where they are drained of blood.\n\nOur braves have become adept at hunting and killing these creatures.

Following the foundation of this settlement the Inek found themselves drawn towards the coast, expanding the Inek settlement and eventually absorbing the Busilari settlement.

 R05_visitors_from_all_of_haless_desc:0 "Mount Tughayasa is the cultural heart of Haless. Visitors come from all over to visit the Augurs. That means that a steady stream of communication can be maintained through the travellers passing through the Order's lands. Consequently the Order is able to maintain many strong political relations."
 R05_protecting_the_oracle:0 "Protecting the Order"
 R05_protecting_the_oracle_desc:0 "Because of the cultural importance of the Order to Haless, many have come and volunteered to join the ranks of the Prophecy Guard, this reinforced their ranks of professionals with an enthusiasm and zeal that permeates those who fight for the ability to see the future."

 R05_dedications_desc:0 "Bribery is an addiction for the wealthy and powerful. So it is an addiction that permeates their interactions with the Order too. Many an extension to the Order's Complex have been financed by wealthy merchants or kings looking for a favourable outcome to their prophecy, all the while not understanding that the future doesn't care about their money."
 R05_oracle_agents:0 "Augur's Eyes"
 R05_oracle_agents_desc:0 "While the Order on mount Tughayasa has its arcane and spiritual means of predicting the future, it did also benefit from a wide network of agents all over Haless. These so called 'Augur's Eyes' were careful to listen and see what news might be afoot that would aid in the making of more mundane prophecies."

 R05_students_of_the_oracle_desc:0 "The libraries and minds atop mount Tughayasa hold many secrets and generations of knowledge. This has attracted all sorts of bright minds from all over Haless who offer their services to the Order in the hopes of gaining some insight in the truth of the world."

 R06_portcullis_of_the_marutha_desc:0 "The great fortress of Bubhagama rises suddenly from the hills of the Serpentspine and towers over the countryside north of the Marutha desert. Whoever holds this citadel controls the passes between the mountains and the desert, and can easily prevent an enemy from attempting to march around the western flank of the arid plains of Marutha and into the hills of Rakhadesh. It is for this reason that Bubhagama has come to be called 'The Portcullis of the Marutha', and our custodianship of this vital chokepoint has led us to specialize in defensive tactics that ensure the might of our bastion in the Northwest."
 R06_senapti_of_the_northwest:0 "The Reforms of Mahipalar"
 R06_senapti_of_the_northwest_desc:0 "Historically, the northwest of the Raj has been poor and its governorship has not been a particularly prestigious position. That changed when Mahipalar of the Flower Oath ascended the throne, his brilliance and personal zeal for good government calling back to the legendary leadership of the philosopher-kings of old. Under his watch, Babhagama came to flourish despite the lack of wealth or resources in the region, his careful planning and watchful eye correcting all inefficiencies. The success of this administrative focus on centralized planning subsequently began a long tradition of excellent administration in Babhaghama."

 R06_great_refuge_of_grozumdhir_desc:0 "When Grôzumdihr, the home of the Peridot dwarves, was destroyed in ages past, the survivors fled into the hills and valleys of Rahen. Integrating quickly into the land where they found safety, the dwarves of Grôzumdihr and their descendants became known across Rahen as skilled advisors and bureaucrats. Our lands were some of the first where the refugees of Grôzumdihr fled to after its fall, and a large community of these dwarves continues to live in Babhagama to this day, serving our community as excellent statesmen and advisors."
 R06_chakrams_of_bubhagapur:0 "Chakrams of Bubhagapur"
 R06_chakrams_of_bubhagapur_desc:0 "The chakram, a circular throwing disk with a sharpened outer edge, is a particularly common weapon among the folk of Bubhagapur. In battle the weapon is twirled on the index finger of an upraised hand and thrown with a timed flick of the wrist - this technique can easily propel a chakram several hundred feet with deadly accuracy. Though training to use the Chakram is difficult, its unusual mechanics make it useable by both infantry and cavalry and makes our forces effective at inflicting great casualties on the enemy before we engage in close combat. As its use spreads among our soldiers, the chakram promises great utility and has become a symbol of our martial prowess."
 R06_ghankedheni_irregulars:0 "Ghankedheni Irregulars"
 R06_ghankedheni_irregulars_desc:0 "Though the Senapti of Babhagama has de jure ruled the lands of the Shepherd folk for hundreds of years, in reality our control over the hill country of the west has always been shaky at best. Recent military and diplomatic successes have led to more direct integration of the Ghankedheni into our growing realm, however, and the invaluable knowledge of ambushes and positioning that these warriors bring to our officer corps will certainly be of great help in the future."
 R06_trilingual_administration:0 "Trilingual Administration"
 R06_trilingual_administration_desc:0 "The hilly lands of Babhaghama sit at a linguistic confluence, with the Ghankedheni to the south speaking a dialect of Rakhadeshi, while the folk of the Ruin Kingdoms to the East speak in the Shamakhadi tongue. When our government arrived, we brought a third language with us - Sarniryabsadi, the tongue of the South and the Ascension Peninsula, birthplace of the harimari.\n\nWhile some governments would attempt to impose the language of the ruling class onto their subjects, we see clearly the folly of attempting to force a new language on a linguistically divided region. Instead, we will conduct official business in all three tongues of Babhagama, fostering goodwill among our diverse subjects and allowing us to more easily manage the myriad peoples present in our holdings."
 R06_swear_the_flower_oath:0 "Swear the Flower Oath"
 R06_swear_the_flower_oath_desc:0 "Rahen is beset on all sides: the hobgoblins crash down like an avalanche in the north, calls for a solar crusade echo from the western dunes, and within a toxic miasma of corruption and decadence saps our unity. Only strength will save her, the strength of unity and wisdom, and that is a strength Babhagma has. At this time of crisis we are reminded of the poetic works of the great Harimari poet and former Senapti of Babhagama, Kobidran. Among his most famous works, the poem that would become known as The Flower Oath began 'On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.'\n\nMany see a message of a changing season where destined conclusions come to pass in these words, and find them deeply relevant to modern times. We agree - and we will embody this longing, ambition, and surety as we reaffirm the oath that gave our ruling dynasty its name. Under our firm paw we will bring the peace and serenity of the lotus blossom to Rahen by any means necessary."

It is a vast pyramidal structure made of stones the color of a blazing sun and fit together so precisely that the temple stands without a trace of mortar between each great brick. Tiltaghar has been the seat of petty kings and great priests in Shamakhad for thousands of years, most recently being occupied as the seat of one of the Dhenijanraj's eight senapti. As the seat of our government, we are caretakers of the temple, and its glory brings us great prestige and the envy of all those who behold its majesty."

 R08_the_last_loyal_lord_in_shamakhad_desc:0 "As the north disintegrates into chaos before the onslaught of the Command and squabbling independent kingdoms attempt to assert their strength, we have remained loyal to the Raja in Dhenijansar.

 R08_reject_harimari_military_supremacy_desc:0 "Far from the Ascension Peninsula, we have come to organize our military not as an elite harimari force, but a large army of humans intermixed with harimari commanders and shock troops. Each race has their strengths and weaknesses - and we do not foolishly fail to recognize the strength of the humans of Rahen. Our army will be an integrated and professional force that combines the best of all our soldiers."

 R08_host_of_the_warrior_exiles_desc:0 "When the kingdoms and Sir and Raghajand fell to the Command, many of those who escaped the hobgoblin onslaught fled south and settled in the independent border lords. Many of these exiles who congregate in our lands are eager for the opportunity to fight the hobgoblins and reclaim their homelands, and to this end they have offered their service as mercenaries and officers in our army. Their military experience will be invaluable in the wars to come."
 R08_glassworks_of_tiltaghar:0 "Marutha Gilt-Glass"
 R08_glassworks_of_tiltaghar_desc:0 "Glassmaking is a difficult art and a jealously guarded secret among those guilds and artisans that have mastered its secrets. In Rahen, all of the great glassmakers can be found in southern Shamakhad, and many call Tiltaghar their home - its adjacency to the Marutha provides easy access to high-grade sands so necessary for the process. The signature glasses of Tiltaghar are streaked through with bright yellows and greens and are sometimes called "Gilt-glass", referencing the vibrant golds spun into the glass. eagerly sought after by the nobility of Rahen and beyond for their beauty, they are our most prized export."
 R08_road_between_twin_pyramids:0 "Road Between the Twin Pyramids"
 R08_road_between_twin_pyramids_desc:0 "A thousand leagues to the east of Tiltaghar stands Tilathi, the Ziggurat of the Elephant, twin to our great capital. A twin to the golden Pyramid of the Tiger, the Elephant Temple is carved of stone that gleams like pure silver, mirroring her western sibling the same way that the moon mirrors the sun in the sky.\n\nThese two great temples mark the ends of the ancient Sojourner's Road, a winding path once walked by pilgrims who believed that the enlightenment of the High Gods could be reached somewhere on that sacred road. Though it has fallen into disrepair in recent years due to the conflict raging in northern Rahen, the Sojourner's Road and Tilathi remain sacred places of great beauty worthy of restoration and protection. We shall defend the holy road and the great sentinels that mark its ends, and in doing so demonstrate our piety and legitimacy."
 R08_caste_without_prejudice:0 "The Edict of Tiltaghar"
 R08_caste_without_prejudice_desc:0 "Once, Harimar's grandson Manava passed the Edict of Sardiphadin to restructure the ancient Raheni caste system with harimari at the top and humans beneath them. While this decree was unquestioned by many in South Rahen, in Tiltaghar the distance from the centers of political gravity meant that the reform never took as firm of a hold. Throughout the history of the Northern Senapti, humans proved their valor, skill, and intelligence, and the attitudes of the harimari rulers of Tiltaghar changed to become far more accepting of working with, instead of ruling over, humans over the years. This culminated in the 1601 Edict of Tiltaghar, issued shortly after the collapse of the Dhenijanraj's central authority, and decreed that the highest castes would no longer be forbidden to humans, who would henceforth be equal partners in the land of the Tiger Ziggurat."

Although they will not fight our wars, and more often than not fight amongst each other, at the end of the day they still pay their taxes. Given the necessity of this cash-flow to the continued functioning of our state, the administration of Dhenijanraj has been adapted to collect the Prabhi Tithe as efficiently as possible."

 R51_harimari_in_the_van_humans_on_the_flanks_desc:0 "Though fierce fighters, and obviously far superior to the various humans of Rahen, harimari are relatively few in number. As such, Dhenijnraj’s military has been adapted so that, although Dhenijanraj maintains an elite core of harimari foot soldiers, a majority of the ranks are filled by humans. This allows its army to maintain a harimari standard of quality, without sacrificing quantity."

 R51_the_graciousness_of_the_raj_desc:0 "From Anbennar to Yanshen, the glory of the Raja’s court is almost legendary. Home to uncountable courtiers, servants, and scribes, the court of Dhenijansar holds great prestige. Often, visitors to the court are awestruck by the sheer scale itself. Therefore, Dhenjinraj holds somewhat more diplomatic prestige than its neighbors."

 R51_centralisation_of_the_banners_desc:0 "For millennia, the Harimari banners of the Raj have been summoned to defend it in times of war, and under the leadership of Dhenjinraj it has been no different. These forces, though mighty, had always been somewhat disorganised. The reforms of Raja Birnayaran Padna in 1674, however, would reorganise these banners, placing them into the Raj’s existing military hierarchy."
 R51_the_imperial_guard:0 "The Imperial Guard"
 R51_the_imperial_guard_desc:0 "The Imperial Guard, also known as the Raja’s Three Thousand, are an elite force of harimari soldiers, hand-picked from the ranks of the Raj’s military based on their prowess in combat, and their loyalty to the state. In times of peace, as their name implies, they act as a personal guard force for the Raja, but in times of war, although not all leaving the Raja’s side, many will join the workings of the army, acting as advisors, generals, or in many cases, front-line troops."

As the first to answer the call of the Raj and arrive with our armies whenever the drums of war beat, and for our consistent service, we have the honor of holding the vital right flank in the Raja's armies.\n\nWe are the elite and faithful Warlords of the Inner Raj - all who see our banner know our reputation, and we will never forget the splendor of our past service or the many victories we have won."

 R52_first_vizier_manava_desc:0 "Manava of the Bloody Claw, Senapti of Rabhidaraj since the moment of his birth in 1409, was always am ambitious and talented youth. As he grew all could see that he would be a great leader, and as Senapti of Rabhidaraj he spent much time at the nearby court of the aging Raja Indranayar. The old harimari took a shine to the energetic young Manava and began to delegate many responsibilities to his vassal.\n\nManava, ever hungry for more power and personal advancement, took on these positions with relish, leveraging his personal position at court to amass great wealth, influence, and even seize the nearby city of Nabukh from the Prabhi of Sadathar. At the height of his influence, Manava was the power behind the throne of the Raja - and some claimed that it was he who truly ruled over the whole of the Raj. Even after his death in 1478, the long shadow of Manava has laid over the court at Parusapa, and Rabhidaraj would ever after be known for their ambition and desire to rule."

It is said that where he passed, our people were given the spark of zealotry, and to this day they are some of the most righteous of preachers. We can put this zealousness to good use converting any who stray from the true faith to strange philosophies, though perhaps our beliefs align more with a new wind blowing from the west than with the old ways of the High Gods..."

Despite our internal diplomatic struggles, the Radiant Sun is also strong in the great mercantile republic of Bhuvauri to the East, and we have cultivated many commercial contacts there.\n\nTheir mercantile bent and knack for a good deal has rubbed off on many of those merchants who have regular contact with the slave-princes, and we find our traders growing more skilled by the day. By encouraging widespread adoption of Bhuvauri techniques and methodologies concerning the flow of trade we may be able to leverage our improved economic situation to overcome our isolated diplomacy."
 R52_treason_of_ghamakrit:0 "The Treason at Ghamakrit"
 R52_treason_of_ghamakrit_desc:0 "When a force of forty thousand Jaddari zealots crossed into Rahen and aimed at Dhenijansar, we rallied to the Raja's banners as we had always done since days of old. But our adherence to the Radiant Sun school of High Philosophy had made the message of the Jadd particularly compelling to our Senapti and many of our warriors, and the ever-ambitious lords of Rabhidaraj sensed an opportunity. Secret talks were initiated with the Jaddari, via Bhuvauri liaisons, to betray the Raja and join our realm to theirs - in return, we would convert to the Jadd and join them as equal partners in empire.\n\nWhen the forces of the Dhenijanraj met the Jaddari at the Battle of Ghamakrit, the Rabhidaraji held the right flank as always - but at a critical moment in the battle, we withdrew and exposed the Raja's center, allowing them to be crushed by the Jaddari cavalry. With the army broken, we marched alongside the Jaddari to the gates of Dhenijansar and threw down the walls for our new brothers in the faith. Thus, by the treason of Rabhidaraj did the Jaddari gain their dominance over lower Rahen - and we obtained our central place as governors and administrators in their growing realm, sculpting policy from within as willing partners instead of subjugated serfs."
 R52_links_to_the_west:0 "Knowledge from the West"
 R52_links_to_the_west_desc:0 "The advance of the Jaddari and the arrival of the first Cannorian traders brought many ideas and technological advancements to Rahen. Though the harimari have long had a strong traditionalist bent and have been slow to adopt technological innovations, Rabhidaraj's religious conversion has led us to see the light in more ways than one. The ideas that travel down the Golden Highway, that come ashore at Sramaya, will not stop just because we wish them to. No, let us recognize the value of these new ideas, the value inherent in adaptability, and propagate these new innovations through the territories under their control."

 R52_deioderan_warlords_desc:0 "The Jadd Empire would not last forever, and when the great civil war that tore the empire in two broke out, Rabhidaraj was swift to act. From our position in central Rahen we could rapidly seize strategic points, and our long partnership with the Jaddari had ensured that we retained a well trained personal military force and were skilled administrators who could dominate Dhenijanraj and the lands that surround it. Because of this, in the months and years that would follow the fall of the Jadd Empire, Rabhidaraj would establish itself as a power player in the emerging Deioderan polities that would dominate Rahen for the next half-century."

However, once united, it quickly became clear that to disunite them would be an even harder task, as a unique Sardhasi identity had been forged amongst the Raheni and harimari who made up the new state.

Placing harimari firmly at the top, and Humans decidedly not at the top, many Raheni have seen the new system as little more than the tool of an oppressor. However, as the cities, both human and harimari, have grown closer, the system has loosened somewhat, allowing at least a little upward mobility. Although not perfect, this change seems to have kept the general populace happy."

This trade would make Sardhasi increasingly wealthy, for no matter what, the silk must flow."

However, over time, these disparate groups have at least somewhat united into the League of Kharunyana, a tremendous mercantile organisation that stretches across the porcelain cities and beyond.

As such, they were constantly under threat of assault from outside forces, with said threat only exasperated by their great wealth. As such, the cities always lay behind massive walls in order to keep them secure.\n\nBy the 1600s, however, this situation became unfeasible, as the cities’ inhabitants pressed against the walls, and the cities ran out of room. This led to several vast construction projects throughout the region, as old walls were demolished, and new ones were constructed several dozen attilambi away. This would begin a pattern lasting throughout the coming centuries, as walls were repeatedly demolished and rebuilt ever further away to make room for the rapidly growing populations of the porcelain cities."

 R75_global_merchantile_deals_desc:0 "Although the peoples of Dhujat were always renowned merchants throughout Haless, they never really had much influence beyond the continent. However, with the rise in global trade routes brought on during the Age of Artificers, Dhujati trade routes would expand well beyond Haless and into the rest of the world; from Cannor to Sarhal to distant Aelentir, one would have to search extremely hard for a single port without at least a few Dhujati merchants. And for each one of those merchants, every deal they struck, every good they sold, every coin that fell into their pockets, all of that wealth would return with them back up the Kharunyana, and only make the porcelain cities wealthier yet."

 U17_no_representation_no_tax_desc:0 "The Crathánori secession from Re'uyel was primarily motivated by lack of representation in the newly formed nobles' republic that had overthrown the previous regime. The province of Crathánor had few nobles yet many merchants, and thus had few representatives in the government. This meant that the Crathánori had no power to stop the Re'uyeli nobles from placing heavy tax burdens on them.\n\nAs a result, the merchants began agitating for independence. In 1421 they delivered an ultimatum to the nobility: Give us fair representation, or we will stop paying taxes. This was coldly rejected, and thus Crathánor seceded, adopting a condensed version of the ultimatum as its official motto. This would become the founding principle of the newborn republic."

Only when the dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr came to their aid could the deadlock be broken. But just as the tide had turned, the goblin invasions began in 1423.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the untrained militia fought many desperate battles, winning some and losing many.

Crathánor would prosper greatly as a result and reach the zenith of its power.\n\nBut eventually, the sun must set, as the day cannot last forever.

It was originally tasked with guarding the eastern border of the Kingdom of Dameria. Its knights were renowned lancers and participated in many tourneys and battles throughout the centuries, their fearsome charges shattering lines of infantry with ease.\n\nEver since the formation of Anbennar, the Order's status and importance diminished. The long years of peace in Anbennar meant that fewer and fewer knights joined it. Yet the Order served Dameria faithfully until the Lilac Wars. During that conflict, Vincen II síl Cestir, the Duke of Cestirande and Grandmaster of the Order, declared independence from Dameria and joined the Rose Party. In 1444 Lilac Wars were over and the Order was on the winning side, but only thanks to their betrayal of Dameria."

And lastly, they were among the fiercest supporters of the House of Silmuna, but nevertheless sided with the Rose Party in the Fourth Lilac War. This pragmatic yet dishonourable behaviour earned them few friends but many territories. Unfortunately, it did not result in the prettiest of borders."

Perhaps the most infamous such insult was recorded during the Battle of the Moon Council, when Duke Vincen II síl Cestir called Adénn "Skylance" Silmuna "Brokenlance of the Waning Moon".

But opposing them were the Vernmen of Galeinn, who shared their ambition. This rivalry lasted for countless years and showed no signs of stopping after the Lilac Wars.

The Cestirander breed was versatile, sharing traits of both cold-blooded and warm-blooded horses. The Knights of the Long Lance rode on them during tourneys and battles while farmers used them as work horses. As the importance of cavalry on the battlefield diminished, the latter role would become increasingly important, and the horses were crossbred with cold-blooded ones to make them better draft animals. The Cestirander horses would become the engine of local production, plowing fields and hauling freight."

Yet they continued to diminish as technology developed and made lancers obsolete. Members of the order became little more than titleholders or low-ranking officers in the army.\n\nEventually, however, the Order did have its resurgence. The Dukes and Duchesses of Cestirande began to grant the title of knight to court officials and bureaucrats as a reward for exemplary service. This new generation of knights did not wield the lance, but the pen. The burgeoning paper industry of the Duchy's capital, Cestaire, grew to primarily fuel these new knights and their numerous writings."

Their power was absolute, and only an outside force could bring an end to their rule.\n\nAfter the unification of the Empire of Anbennar, many Cestiranders would work in the administration of the huge nation, becoming vital cogs of the sprawling bureaucratic machine."

Large and heavy ships, either merchantmen or warships, could easily enter the harbour and dock safely. Above all, however, it was extensively utilized by the local shipyard. The citizens of Sorncell had been building ships as long as they had lived there, and became renowned for their craft."

 A56_order_of_serondor_desc:0 "To combat piracy by gnolls and Nathalairey, the Count of Celliande established the Knightly Order of Serondor, named after the famed Celliander captain Serondor síl Sorncell. He was a famous figure who sailed his ship across the Divenhal, hunting pirate ships and saving coastal villagers from slavery and worse. One day, he sailed away only to never to be seen again. The Order respected his name by fulfilling his duty. Thus, the Knights of Serondor did not ride horses, but commanded swift galleys and galleons."

 A56_famed_satin_doveswall_desc:0 "The town of Doveswall was known for satin fabric manufactured by its craftsmen, made out of silk imported from the east. It was primarily used for extravagant clothing worn by wealthy Celliander noblewomen, as it was extremely expensive. In later years, when Arannen became the primary center of textile production in the Borders, Doveswall lost much of its relevance, its weavers seeing Arannen as an upstart rival. They invested much into improving their production methods so they could compete with the northern city."

 A56_bulwar_trade_desc:0 "Thanks to the harbour of Sorncell, Celliande was the primary destination for Bulwari trade goods which were shipped across the Divenhal to be sold on Anbennarian markets. While places like Busilar had larger ports, Celliande enjoyed the privilege of being in the Empire of Anbennar. Many eastern trade goods that were sold in the rest of Anbennar had passed through Celliande, so its Counts grew wealthy from custom duties."

 A56_heirs_milcorissia_desc:0 "In the 16th century, chroniclers studied the past and the upper class of Celliande learned about the ancient Kingdom of Milcorissia that had once dominated the Borders. While the Milcori people had later been devastated by the War of the Sorcerer King and the White Pestilence, the Arannese were considered their descendants. The nobles were inspired by these tales and began fabricating family trees claiming descent from legendary Kings and Queens of Milcorissia."
 A56_milk_skinned_folk:0 "Milk-Skinned Folk"
 A56_milk_skinned_folk_desc:0 "Considered by the Celliander upper class as evidence of their Milcori heritage, the Arannese of Celliande had especially pale skins, and black hair was more common than in the rest of the Borders. Those who lived outside of the Borders saw Celliander women as especially beautiful and elegant. This stereotype became more widely known in the 18th century, when it appeared in Anbennarian poetry and stories. In the 19th century, the term "Celliander" was often used for the advertisement of women's beauty products."
 A56_eagle_spreads_wings:0 "The Eagle Spreads Its Wings"
 A56_eagle_spreads_wings_desc:0 "Because the Counts of Celliande saw themselves as rightful heirs of ancient Milcorissia, it was not difficult for them to fabricate territorial claims on lands owned by neighbouring statelets. Milcorissia, after all, had encompassed much of the Borders. Thus several futile wars were fought, but Celliande never reached the heights of the legendary Milcori Kingdom. The period of expansionist policy eventually came to an end with the unification of the Empire of Anbennar."

 A78_crown_of_thorns_desc:0 "Roilsard was an old Duchy, having existed for centuries. But during the Lilac Wars, it chose the wrong side in the conflict and was dismantled by the victorious Kingdom of Lorent. The Crown of Thorns, worn by the Roilsardi rulers, was burned into ashes. Years later, the Roilsardi defied their Lencori cousins and restored the Duchy anew after reclaiming its former lands. The Crown was remade and is now once again worn by the ruler of Roilsard. The experience made the Roilsardi people more determined than ever to fight for their homeland and keep it safe from foreigners who wanted nothing more than to destroy Roilsard."

 A78_between_two_cultures_desc:0 "Being located on the edge of Lencori lands, next to Dameria, Roilsard had a unique position in between the two distinct cultures. While culturally closer to the Lencori, the Roilsardi aligned politically more with Dameria. However, they often used their position to their advantage to act as mediators between Lorent and Dameria, which enabled them to retain their independence for a considerably long time, despite their relatively small size as a country."
 A78_thorned_wall:0 "The Thorned Wall"
 A78_thorned_wall_desc:0 "It is commonly thought that the famed Thorn formation originated in Lorent, but the Roilsardi have always claimed it was based upon their own tactics. For centuries, Roilsardi pikemen had been a literal thorn in the side of Lorentish cavalry, which inspired the Lorentish General Darien síl Ainethán to eventually develop the Thorn formation. Regardless where it originated, the Roilsardi were exceptional in using the mixed formation of pikes and gunners to deter cavalry chargers and maintain a solid frontline against the enemy."

After the Crusade was over and the Pestilence had been eradicated, some Roilsardi crusaders returned home, but many chose to stay and became the new ruling class of the Borders. The Crusade brought much fame and respect for the Roilsardi in Cannor, and their efforts in it were never truly forgotten."

 A78_roilsard_wine_desc:0 "Commonly simply known as "Roilsard", the Roilsardi wine was a fruity and dry red wine with a hint of spice, known for its acidity. While often compared with its Saloreni cousin, the Roilsardi wine was usually stronger with a higher alcohol content. It was often served with traditional roasted foods which were popular among the Roilsardi. It was especially popular among the commoners, yet the upper class enjoyed it similarly and did not regard it as a "peasant drink". One could say that love for Roilsard wine brought national unity for the Roilsardi."
 A78_minaran_cult:0 "The Cult of Minara"
 A78_minaran_cult_desc:0 "Minara was an especially popular goddess among the Roilsardi. She resonated with the Roilsardi not only because of their love of grand celebrations with copious amounts of wine, but also because of the Roilsardi tradition of having large families. Child-making was less of a taboo in Roilsardi culture than elsewhere, and while this resulted in foreigners regarding them as debauched, it did also increase Roilsard's population as long as there was enough food to feed everyone."
 A78_haven_across_the_sea:0 "A Haven Across The Sea"
 A78_haven_across_the_sea_desc:0 "Roilsard's precarious geopolitical position between two powers motivated many to seek a new life across the sea in Aelantir and beyond, where they could live in peace. While many initial settlers perished, eventually large Roilsard communities sprung up in Aelantir, just like they had sprung up in the Borders during the Aldresian Crusade. The Roilsardi colonists would retain their distinct cultural identity to this day, albeit most of them have no desire to return to their homeland."

This later led to conflict with their fellow Wexonards and other neighbours, who changed sides to support the Rose party instead. From Bisanese perspective, they were fighting against traitors, but their righteousness did not bring them victory. Countsbridge and Gnollsgate were lost to the enemy.\n\nEven though Dameria was gone, revanchism was high, and the Bisanese were determined to strike back and win, no matter the cost."

The swordsmanship of the Lionsword was legendary and he established a martial tradition which prevailed for millennia.

 A34_bisanese_corridor_desc:0 "As the Wexhills were difficult to navigate, most overland travel between the Borders and the eastern Dameshead went across the plains between the Khenak and the Wexhills.

 A34_aelthil_elves_desc:0 "As the War of the Sorcerer King raged, Magda of Magdalaire, a Wexonard warlord, allowed elves to settle in what later became known as Aelthíl. While many of the elves assimilated into the human populace, their descendants becoming half-elves, a small enclave of urban elves remained in the heart of Aelthíl. They were called Glassweavers due to their skill of using magic to create elaborate items from glass, so beautiful and intricate that they were famed well beyond Bisan itself.\n\nWhile the Wexonards do show a colder reception to the elven race, the Counts of Bisan have generally allowed them great autonomy and benefits - either due to Bisan's pro-Damerian leanings, or perhaps coin that fills their coffers."
 A34_corpses_corsets:0 "Corpses And Corsets"
 A34_corpses_corsets_desc:0 "The halfling minority in Corseton became well known for their eponymous corsets. Their small hands were helpful with the intricacies and allowed corsets to have much smaller lacings. Corsets were fashionable among noblewomen and the demand for high-quality Corseton corsets brought considerable wealth into Bisan.\n\nHowever, there is also a more morbid origin to the city's name. Many know of The Necropolis that dominates the city, which was, for a longest time, the largest temple of Nerat's faith until the Bone Citadel in Aelantir, but only historians know that Nerat was not a god of a pre-Elikhet Kheterata, but was infact an death god imported by Milcorissian slaves. This fact became widely spread in the 16th century when adventurers uncovered ancient Milcorissian burial grounds in Corseton, containing corpses posed with corsets, leading to the curiously macabre realization that the name for corsets came from corse, an archaic word for corpse."
 A34_harold_gnollsbane:0 "Harold IV Gnollcutter"
 A34_harold_gnollsbane_desc:0 "The hills south of Bisan had long been infested with gnolls who had often launched raids to capture slaves. In 1403 AA, Count Harold the Fourth gathered the army to seize Gnollsgate and bring an end the gnollish menace. The hill gnolls were beaten in several decisive battles and Gnollsgate was secured under Bisanese rule.\n\nThus Harold IV earned the title of "Gnollcutter", becoming one of the most famed military leaders of Bisan's history. His bold tactics continued to influence the Bisanese army for many centuries to come."
 A34_landsday_massacre:0 "The Lansday Massacre"
 A34_landsday_massacre_desc:0 "Many Bisanese were quick to adopt the Corinite faith, as Corin exemplified many traits which were held in high regard in Bisan: Martial ability, courage and willingness to sacrifice oneself for a greater cause. However, many remained loyal to Adean, and soon religious tensions erupted between the two groups like they did elsewhere in Cannor. The Bisanese solved the problem like how they usually did, with violence. In the night of 7th of Nerament 1576, the eve of Lansday, the Corinite faithful struck at the Adeanic nobility. The outbreak of assassnations and mob violence resulted in thousands of deaths and crippled the power of the Adeanics, securing Corinite control of Bisan."

In 1340, seeking influence within the Empire of Anbennar, King Davan I plotted to see his second son Valeran to marry and bring nearby Asheniande into the Corvurian domain. This backfired spectacularly, with the cadet House of síl Vivin-Asheniande maintaining its allegiance to Anbennar and with it the lands of Ravenhill and surrounds from Corvuria, sparking The War of the Pale Raven which Corvuria lost.\n\nAdopting the Pale Raven (the opposite of the Corvurian black) as their sigil, the síl Vivins of Asheniande has grown in power considerably since then, combining the harsh mentality of their elder house with the graces required to navigate the intrigues of Anbennarian politics."

The Giantsbane Phalanx, named after Castan Giantsbane, was a rigid and sophisticated elite infantry legion that was able to successfully repel and exterminate the last of the true giants.

While king Marr believed griffons to be just another pest, Ulric believed that these griffons were essential to protect the nation from another dragon's wrath. He was the first human to train a griffon, and down the line he created the first elite division of griffon cavalry.\n\nIn more recent times, Griffon riders are made up of Marrhold nobles and commonborn knights who had proven their worthiness of riding a griffon with an exceptional act of valor in the battlefield.

When the Korbarid king questioned why the tribe would go east to a dangerous land, Marr declared "Fear not, for lightning does not strike twice!"\n This phrase perfectly symbolized Marrodic's Alenic roots of a hardy and rough people, and even when they settled in a new land the people held on to their original culture."

The Marrhold militia was able to cross through secret tunnels while the capital was being sieged, and by morning the Blademarcher king found himself cut off from his supply line and surrounded on both sides. The subsequent surrender of the Blademarches shocked all of Cannor, and Marrhold gained immense prestige as a nation 'nigh impossible to siege'.

In the 17th century, however, the grand reopening of the Marrhold tunnel changed and boosted trade between dwarves and humans.

Bustling workshops ring the shaft, taking advantage of a complex pulley system to move goods up and down.\n\nThe unique architecture and make of these parts of the hold is a result of the reclamation of early diamond quarries.

For once, the sight of dragonfire filled me with hope, and the flames reflected on his scales, shining so brightly that it seemed dawn had come for a moment. Two years after the end of the Dragonwake, I still feel blessed by this memory. All of our people should feel blessed that twice in history, Castellos himself appeared in the form of the Silver Dragon to save Castanor from a horrible end.'\n\n-Autobiography of Castan XXXVII the Rebuilder"
 B32_the_imperial_crown:0 "The Crown of Humanity"
 B32_the_imperial_crown_desc:0 "It truly is a pity that of all the artifacts recovered by the adventurers after the Greentide, the old silver crown of Castanor is still missing. Hence, when Castanor was rebuilt from its ashes, it was clear to all that the new Castan lacked a fitting crown. From today on, this will not be the case.\n\nOut of silver and mithril, in one year of work, our best smiths forged a huge majestic crown. At the base, shining brightly, is a circlet sculpted to depict the White Walls. Surmounting each tower of the circlet are statues of the gods of the Cannorian Pantheon, encrusted with innumerable jewels. At the center, linked to the interior of the wall by bands of metal, lies an astonishingly accurate representation of Trialmount, topped with a huge diamond! But that is not all, as there are actually two different parts in this masterpiece! Our smiths forged a splendid miniature dragon, and the most talented enchanter of our realm created an invisible magic link between the two parts, so that the dragon can levitate atop the crown! The mighty Silver Dragon of Castanor deploying its wings around Castan's head as he speaks is truly a sight to behold."

Many of the cities were sacked amidst the "Typhoon of Broken Vases," as the infamous event became known, but not Semphrerong — it just happened that the city was between contracts, for the first time in centuries. It was manning its walls with a smattering of other mercenaries, and so was passed over amidst the chaos."

But King Levodas didn't weep, and fought on, slaying the three champions one by one and avenging his companions.

To this, a companion of the slain King rallied the warriors yet again, saying “When the last Malacnari is slain, then you will rule Malacnar.”, and once he was slain his next best companion rose to revolt, and so on and so forth...

Only after the barycenter of the Empire had shifted south to the lands of the Sarda, did they break free along the rest of Dolindha.

We will tear down the old Bostynn Bridge, and, using the most lavish materials our coffers can import as well as advice from Cannorian engineers, we will build a new splendid bridge that will signal a new start for the town, and help revitalize the local economy."

In a stark contrast to us, Bostynn has always been the home of fierce, outright obstinate people, who jumped at every opportunity to revolt, forming impromptu bands of peasant warriors who ransacked the countryside until the Imperial army would inevitably arrive to put them down.\n\nThe "Bridge-Wardens" were experienced hunters who frequently put themselves at the head of those revolts and, when not busy leading, constituted the best archers available north of Arverynn.

While nobody contests that Stantirshalan produce is of far higher quality, it would be foolish to let ourselves fall behind in quantity: we shall invite some Cannorian farmers as honourary guests to our harvest festivals, where, under the effect of the beer - and the sense of commonality brought by our festivities - it'll be easy for them to open up and share the secrets of their craft."

When King Jeborad crossed the Ynn at Vels Bacar to conquer southward, he did so coming to the aid of his allies in Stanyrhrada.

Impervious to fire, the tree is said to be old as the Ynn itself, and will impart its wisdom on any soul kind enough to write a poem for it.

Scarily large and unapproachable even to the most seasoned foresters and pure-hearted souls, the secret to ride them has been jealously passed down Drevkenuc's ruling line, and while Drevkenuco rulers are disqualified from riding them in jousts, nobody can contest that the sight of a Drevkenuco lord atop one of those massive creatures is a truly astonishing sight to behold."

While the most common destinations for this trip are Vareynn and Arverynn, the most daring youth have ventured all the way to the ruins of the old Mountain Kingdom occupied by the heathen Rzentur, the endless plains of the Epednar, the dark forest of the Cursed Ones, or even the northern wastes populated by Ice Sleepers, bringing home powerful artifacts and becoming adults along the way."

No more! It was King Vylaron of Vareynn who made our ancestors see the errors of their ways, and ever since our conversion in the fourth century after Flood we have been quick and proactive in stamping out any form of heathenry, just like King Vylaron did, by having every village - no matter how small or secluded - presided by the watchful eye of a river inquisitor."

The weakest victims convulse and scream ripping at their skin only a few minutes after Leak has entered their bloodstream, while the strongest are slowly driven insane over the course of days or weeks as their family watches.

While he made many enemies, and died without reaching his ambition, the bold - if not outright visionary - ambition of Alaran left a mark on the collective imagination, and he became the most famous scion of House yen Cestor, his name learned by young Ynnic lords through history books.\n\nPerhaps a little Alaran is growing up in Trompolere today and, inspired by the myth of his predecessor, he will amaze the world with even greater ambitions."

While some of our advisors have brought up the possibility of adopting firearns, archery is the symbol of our nation, and we are not going to forsake it for a clunky glorified crossbow brough by outsiders. Rather, we shall double our efforts to counter the weapon of the Cannorians, donning our troops in enchanted cloaks resistant to gunpowder and casting magical protections on their eardrums.

While his brothers pursued the paths of rulership and priesthood, Erandil heeded the call of the wilds, becoming a hunter then an adventurer, and spent two decades travelling across newfounded Cannorian settlements in Veykoda.\n\nWhen his home country became embroiled in the War of the Bacaran Succession, Erandil rode home to assist the fight first-hand, and trained a new generation of archers. While uninterested in a stable profession such as general or instructor, the legacy of Erandil's drills allowed Trompolerey archery, already renowned, to reach its final apex."

While many towns sought the protection of lords and lost their independence, Bosancovac pooled its wealth into hiring mercenaries and swaying landless knights to their side.\n\nOn the water, many of these knights began anew, forsaking their heavy armour and horses in favour of light scalemail and gondolas - and while this earned them the mocking name of "Paddleboard Knights" by other Dolindhans, they eagerly adopted it as their own, having the last laugh because, on the water, even the mightiest antler horse is just food for the fish."

This duality was finally brought to an end in 1224, when the River faction, aided by the lordship of Amacimst and many Paddleboard Knights, assumed undisputed control of the Bridge-Town and confined the mayor of Bosancovac to the far side of the Ynn River, at Imstana.\n\nEver since then, the day of the Holy Coup is celebrated with a week of festivities as a crowd marches from the western side of the River towards the southern one, reciting holy sermons and partaking in many activities along the way: canoe races and canoe jousts, public banquets, zoos of river monsters, dramatic recreations of historical events and plays... all generously funded by our patrician families."

The allegations include, but are not limited to: false advertising, late deliveries, passing off Brelari iron as Malacnari steel, last-minute haggling, hiring thugs to poke holes into the rowing boats of competitors, conspiring with the Order of the Mountain Eye to bring about the collapse of the Ynnic Empire, and being displeasantly curt towards customers, making the child of one of them cry.\n\nWhile many important figures within Bosancovac have stepped up against this unacceptable slander against one of our respected merchants, providing alibis and evidence, those facts were simply used as further ammunition by Rea Narsi's detractors, who proceeded to accuse the entire Bosancovac elite of covering up for the misdeeds of their countryman.\n\nEver since this affair, the stereotype of Bosancovaco citizens being greedy and untrustworthy entered the collective imagination of Ynnic peoples, which was a catastrophe for our business, but also a huge pressure on us to be as honest and upstanding as possible at all times, a fact which is clearly reflected in modern Bosancovaco society."

While this originally meant trading with Sarda lordships downstream and the occasional Veykodan tribe, a huge new array of opportunities opened up with the arrival of Cannorian settlers. Particularly fruitful was the trade of lamp oil and ropes made from the fat and leather of mighty Dolindhan animals, and bombs, the manufacturing of which saw a small boom in the Bridge-Town of Bosancovac. In turn, Bosancovaco patricians started collecting many new goods and commodities the Cannorians brought, with rubies from Balgabar being the most prized rarity."

Its namesake walls were taller and sturdier than even the Great Ynnic Dams of today, and endless assailants and refugees would chip away at them in the hopes of one day breaking in.\n\nIn the sixth century after Flood, Amstenur finally met its end after a two-decades-long siege coinciding with the arrival of the Dolindhans. Its walls were thus dismantled, their stone taken away and used to build the Great Ynnic Dams of today, as well as our castle in Stenurynn.

Taking place in 628, it was meant to legitimize the governorship of Lord Calsanqir, who had been entrusted the territory of Stenurynn by Empress Zeldja I as a reward for his loyalty during the quashing of the rebellion ensuing from Joanseln’s assassination.\n\nWhile initially many scoffed at the mixed marriage, the Empress herself attended it, and the following century would see many more such unions bloom.

However, he was ultimately executed by Emperor Calrodiy II for failing to extend the lifespan of the ailing emperor, and many of his discoveries were then banned from publication. Recently, a hidden chamber has been found within the shrine, containing Adrahel’s notes: while some of those are outdated for modern medicine, others may just prove vital in saving the lives of our people."

Other authors have chosen to ignore the matter of the Ending Flood completely, focusing instead on Arkanvyr’s bravery and ingenuity in the face of unknown monsters and hardships, a bravery which has inspired many a Ynnic knight to do great deeds such as the slaying of Drozmagog, the Rzentur dragon."

Rather than competing for championship, the Knights Oathkeeper have thus decided to serve as law-enforcement, flying their white banners and drapes across the forested countryside as they deter any aspiring brigant and rabble-rouser from disturbing the peace. And while other knights may mock this relatively placid lifestyle, isn’t peace what all true warriors strive for?\n\nIn 1721, at the Battle of Delanydon Crossing, the Knights Oathkeeper finally took up arms yet again - but not the arms everyone expected, for they began unleashing deadly volleys of pistol fire upon the enemy lines before their charge, in a devastating combination of Tellumtiri gunmanship and Ynnic chivalry."

But just because of this he wasn't disloyal: when he was offered immortality by a witch, Jurion refused, informed Lukaus, and rode to destroy the witch and her coven. His son Jansred was an excellent rider and in 143 he ambushed the Malacnari in the woods of Grebniesth, halting their resurgence and avenging the line of Lukaus which the Malacnari had extinguished.\n\nStantirvare was the first contact point between Sarda and Dolindhan civilizations, and while it would ultimately wane in importance and shrink into a village, it was Talanis, the third-born son of the Lord of Stantirvare, who went south and founded House yen Bacar, a patrician family of Vels Bacar that eventually rose to become its protectors and rulers."

Departing the old homeland near the western mountains, they navigated the Ynn's deadly waters all the way to Stantirvare, the first encounter between Sarda and Dolindhans. Vels Bacar was built in their honour at the middle point of their voyage, and two giant statues bearing their likeness were constructed, one on each side of the Ynn River.\n\nWhen King Jeborad of Vareynn declared war on the Principality of Vels Bacar in 560, he had his soldiers deface the statue of Filenval-on-the-Northern-Side, cutting off his head and having it be replaced by a replica of his own face. After the war was over, Jeborad mockingly told the Bacarans “Find the head, and you can put it back.”. Bacaran citizens spent two centuries looking for the missing head, until it was finally found to have floated past Adbrabohvi and the Divine Waterfall, ending in the Nether World where a tribe of Boek had taken to worshipping it. Emperor Calasandor yen Brelar graciously paid for its return, while Jeborad's head was brought to Vareynn. “It was destiny” the Emperor commented “That the head of a great explorer would see the world beyond the Ynn River.”\n\nThe statues of Filenval and Filenval stand next to the dam to this day, sending off all the dead who float down the Ynn River."

And as they argued, the Bacaran allies, the Amstenuri, lost a battle they had to fight on their own and found themselves besieged.\n\nIn the second phase of the war, Bacaran sentries kept watch and made fortifications over the fords of Arverynn while their main force engaged the Stanyrhradans, seeing some successes. It was all for nothing when, in 572, Jeborad took the city of Vels Bacar by the storm using a path nobody had foreseen: a massive pontoon bridge had been built in just seven days from one statue of Filenval to the other, and, with the cover of the mist that in rainier days makes it impossible to see the other side of the Ynn, nobody in Vels Bacar noticed Vareynn's soldiers and riders atop their massive antler horses suddenly charging in before it was too late.\n\nThe lesson our marshals have drawn from all this is thus: “Time is of essence.”"

And while the first elections were held successfully to the cheer of the people, this move was deeply unpopular with many Sarda neighbours, who called the new republic an anachronism and a betrayal of Ynnic values in favour of Cannorization. Thus began the War of the Bacaran Succession, where Lord Calrodiy V of Arverynn pressed the claim of a vassal of his to rule Vels Bacar.\n\nThe war soon escalated, involving not only Sarda, but also many frontiermen nations and even the Mayor of Valorpoint and the Gospodh of the Rzentur. In the final stages of the war, kobold snipers were picking off Escanni knights and dwarven cannons mercilessly bombarded the walls of Vels Bacar, as other dwarves on the Bacaran side rebuilt them each day and night. The war lasted for 21 years and saw Vels Bacar besieged five times, ending only after the death of a million people and Vels Bacar's destruction. Afterwards, Vels Bacar stopped existing as a city, and its name was only used to refer to the nearby dam."

Allies turned on one another as cities rose up in rebellion, former generals vied for power and soldiers turned into bandits.\n\nIn this chaos, Lord Adrjon of Stanyrhrada took up arms, gathered the last Imperial forces and loyal knights, and marched to restore order. He defeated the Veykodans, driving them back, then slew the rebels, then managed to relieve Vels Bacar. And when he earned his moniker, Orderbringer, he placed Filimir - a nephew of Varamel - on the throne of Arverynn and swore fealty to him, relenting his own claim to emperorship.\n\nWhile Filimir made a good emperor, he couldn't reconquer Dolindha nor save the Ynnic Empire, and when in 1205 his son Fineas was overthrown and brutally lynched, that spelt the end of any Sarda unity left. Many think that, if only Lord Adrjon Orderbringer had taken the throne, things would have gone so very differently."

No Stanyrhradan vessel is to sail past the bridge of Bostynn, unless driven there by monsters or enemies.\n2. Stanyrhradan merchants may operate in royal Dolindhan lands only in the presence of a scribe or town-clerk, and the sale will go directly to Vareynn's state.\n3. The Prince of Stanyrhrada is to be held accountable for any misconduct on the part of Stanyrhradan merchants towards Vareynnic citizens.\n4. Likewise, none of Vareynn's soldiers, riders and mercenaries are to attack settlements on the banks of the Velenynn tributary of the Ynn River, for they are subjects to Stanyrhrada, unless they are seen flying the banners of Amstenur or Vels Bacar.\n5. In Vareynnic-controlled Sarda colonies, Stanyrhradans are to have the same rights as Dolindhans.”\n\nSigned by kings and princes long gone, what is not gone are the consequences of that treaty, for when in 572 King Jeborad of Vareynn made good of that friendship and crossed the Ynn at Vels Bacar with an army - a feat everybody had thought impossible until then, it marked the beginning of the Ynnic Empire, of which we were the capital for two glorious centuries."

Seeing the world of present and past as irredeemably evil, they targeted the Archives for containing memories of the world and its sins, and blasted the building into the Ynn River.\n\nSome books could be salvaged, but most were lost or made unreadable after they had been fished out of the Ynn. No effort was made to restore those books, but recently some councillors have advised our Lord that, with the arrival of so many new people to the Epednan prairie, new Archives detailing their differences would be most useful. While we may never restore those unreadable books, we can seek knowledge from our neighbours, and see if their stories match with ours and can be used to help reconstruct them; perhaps, along the process, we will accumulate so much new knowledge, the resulting Archives will be even greater than the old ones."

Taking his advice, I ordered Ivrandir to cast an invisibility spell on me and the party, and we took a deviation to stop following the course of the Ynn River, moving northwest further inland to skirt along Arganjuzorn's borders.\n\nEvidently, that wasn't enough, for I was ambushed [...]\nWhen I woke up, my hands were tied and I was on a carriage, and I couldn't see my party anywhere.

When the War of the Bacaran succession erupted in 1602, Mitrenya was already a consummate war veteran, having led incursions into the Epednar territories over the past two decades, going as far as to reach the recently-founded city of Pelodaire during one of them.\n\nIt was thus to everyone's surprise when she announced she would maintain her neutrality during the Bacaran conflict.\n\nTwenty years later, when the war was over, a shocking discovery was made: Mitrenya had been torturing the prisoners made during her past incursions, as well as some of her subjects and even relatives of her vassals. Not satisfied with water magic anymore, she would finish torturing them only to kill them then bathe in their blood; drawing power from it, using it to strengthen her magic and stay young forever.\n\nWith most of the Ynn still recovering from war, nobody moved to oppose Mitrenya, except for Vyr Arok yen Clovenvels, a mercenary captain of Escanni origin who ventured into the forests of Vels Fadhecai and defeated her many minions.

The name of our state is fort, and the specific fort it refers to is the Great Dam-Fort of Gradnaluthe. Our namesake is the largest fort in all of Taychend, and it is widely considered to be our greatest achievement. It was built to serve as a dam across the river running through the heart of our state, allowing us to threaten those downstream into submission, while also being defensible against our enemies.

A castle built on an island at the mouth of the Kalavend River, ever since the Day of Ashen Skies has this strategic position been the envy of the surrounding warlords. And for control of this position many sought to invade our kingdom and lay siege to our cities. While Palaya Orenkoraim, our old capital on the mainland, has resisted countless sieges thanks to its thick walls and resilient populace, those outside its safety would fear for their lives and make for the island-fortress of Kottar Orenkoraim, which is Orenkoraim's true last line of defense.\n\nAfter the wars with Larankar the rulers of Orenkoraim realised the island's strategic position was invaluable, and moved their court there, laying the first stone for an island-city that would prosper and flourish in the centuries to come."

In the early days after our people inherited the world from the ancient gods, was Palaya Orenkoraim one of these wall-less cities. A warlord from Cankamam would take the city and mistreat its people, from this situation a hero would rise.\n\nElrandar challenged the Cankamam warlord to personal combat for rule over the city, and despite the warlord calling upon the help of his companions Elrandar slew them all in a great feat of strength. Now Elrandar led the people of Palaya Orenkoraim to conquer Cankamam. After tearing down the walls and temples of Cankamam, the bricks would be moved along the Kalavend back to Palaya Orenkoraim. Using the stones of their walls and temples would Elrandar order the construction of thick durable walls that were made to reach the heavens, where Elrandar fights to this day after ascending to the gods. In the age of Larankar and eastern invaders imitating the Wallmaker may be the only solution for survival."

He was unable to defend Cankamam and the nearby territories from the Larankarha invasion and was facing revolt. Fearing his rule was coming to an end, he put it over the prosperity and honour of his people, and opened the gates of Palaya Orenkoraim so his new overlords could slaughter all who opposed his rule. Now all the people of Orenkoraim must make up for Aldatam's dishonour and free Orenkoraim from the Larankarha yoke."

Orenkoraim would be the last Taychendi port open to outsiders, outsiders with new ideas and technology. And just like they left their silver and gold when they sailed away so did they leave these ideas and technologies, especially new inventions in weaponry and military tactics that were attractive for the warlike Taychendi."

And the blood of a Marlliander? Pristine, well-kept, bred-for over generations and not a drop allowed to be polluted.

Throughout the seas patrolled by the Pinghoi armadas, one will rarely spot a vessel of a rival band, and only while it sinks from our cannons. Ironically, this means that many trade routes through our territory are safer than those outside, as a trader needs only pay a sufficient tribute to guarantee safety on the high seas."

In 1020, the Treaty of Anbenncóst which ended the war would grant the lands that became Galéinn to a newly founded knightly order, the Knights of the Saltmarch. Funded by the profits of the local salt mines, this order attracted those knights who favored boldness in tactics over personal bravery and prowess.\n\nEventually, as the Kingdom of Verne declined, the knightly order would crown its Grandmaster as a sovereign duke, later becoming a direct vassal of the Damerians. To this day, the Knights of the Saltmarch loyally serve the dukes of Galéinn as our most daring and skilled generals."

 H85_idea_3_desc:0 "The goblins of Svetklan love a good game. Whether board games, puzzles, or sports you can always find a Svetklan goblin willing to partake.

 H85_idea_4:0 "The Value of Patience"
 H85_idea_4_desc:0 "Goblins are an impatient species, always looking for the next best thing or the quickest route to success. This is the greatest asset of goblins, driving them forward and allowing them to reach heights far beyond the other races. But Svetklan goblins are smarter than your average goblin. They know that there is a time and a place for patience. And all the better for it when it is time for haste."
 H85_idea_5:0 "Trade Warfare"
 H85_idea_5_desc:0 "While most think of piracy as restricted to open water, the Dwarovar is home to its own kind of piracy, conducted via twisting underground streams and artificial waterways.

 H85_idea_6:0 "The Lessons of Leadership"

 H85_idea_7:0 "An Ardour for Cannons"
 H85_idea_7_desc:0 "Artillery is beloved of cave goblins, but for the goblins of Svetklan, it goes beyond simple lust for explosions. It is a marriage sustained by a love of the intricate ins and outs of destructive fire. A love of the way that a cannonball can bounce through a formation. An obsession with calculating the proper altitude for an explosive shell to inflict maximum casualties. Within the disorganized piles of what passes for a library in Svetklan, hundreds of books on the use and making of cannons can be found as a testament to this love. When the time comes to use the wick, they know just the right spot."

By training new recruits in the rudimentary tactic of ducking when shot at, the forces of Usmaklan can pass down the tactics gleaned from fighting these foes."
 H87_idea_2:0 "Supply Before Demand"
 H87_idea_2_desc:0 "Though their clan is named the lonely clan, Usmaklan goblins have a keen business sense. Knowing well the laws of supply and demand, they have realized that in order to sell things, those things must be made. Usmaklan workshops are guarded from disruption on a full time basis, and harsh penalties are enforced on goblins whose squabbles interfere with productivity. The wheels of commerce spin thanks to the steady supply of grease these manufactories make."
 H87_idea_3:0 "The International Monetary Board"
 H87_idea_3_desc:0 "The seemingly innocuous name of the International Monetary Board is one feared by all those who do business with Usmaklan cartels. The hardened mercenaries of the IMB are ready to spring into action at a moment's notice to force a client's debtor to pay up. Usually heading straight for the leadership of a merchant guild or country that owes debt, entire kingdoms have been known to be ruined by the harsh conditions imposed by the IMB to force repayment. As well as the devastation that they cause in the process of getting it."
 H87_idea_4:0 "Goblin Snipers"
 H87_idea_4_desc:0 "While most goblins are content with fistfuls of explosives or complicated and loud blunderbusses, the cartel enforcers of Usmaklan prefer the lighter more precise touch of a sniper's weapon. The big holes they make don't hurt either."
 H87_idea_5:0 "Local Cartel Rule"
 H87_idea_5_desc:0 "Cartels are extremely powerful in the society of Usmaklan, engaging with the leadership in the same way that the powerful dukes and counts of Lorent once engaged with the king. It should come at no surprise then that much of the business of local rule is delegated to cartels, particularly in places with a mercantile interest for the state."
 H87_idea_6:0 "Fractal Market Penetration"
 H87_idea_6_desc:0 "Usmaklan maintains trading outposts in many places around the world, particularly the Deepwoods.

 H87_idea_7:0 "The Power of the Free Market"
 H87_idea_7_desc:0 "The invisible hand of the free market is said to be almost like a god for Usmaklan. The entire society of the clan rejects the nation of any outside control of the economy, letting the cartels run wild as they please. Critics of this system point to the untold suffering experienced by the lowest goblins of Usmaklan. But any Usmaklan goblin would be ready to reply with a quarterly report showing their economic growth."

As Slozklan, this tradition has been carried forward and refined. Now their insult skills are not only used to taunt the enemy, but have also become a tool of diplomacy."
 H89_idea_2:0 "Orc Slayers"
 H89_idea_2_desc:0 "Before the Greentide hit Escann, the goblin slave Rurnor Snotfinger lead a group of fellow goblin slaves into the nearby caverns, avoiding the fate of those who became the Common Goblins. Every goblin of Slozklan knows this story well, and knows the truth of why there can never be peace with orcs. They all must die.\n\nThankfully, others agree, and many humans were happy to turn a blind eye to Slozklan's wars against the Orcish kingdoms in Escann."
 H89_idea_3:0 "Free Goblins All"
 H89_idea_3_desc:0 "The goblins of Slozklan know to value freedom, for it is their namesake. It is thus that Slozklan allows no enslaved goblins. Downtrodden, disadvantaged, or disenfranchised certainly. But never enslaved."
 H89_idea_4:0 "Snotfinger University"
 H89_idea_4_desc:0 "Within the depths of Snotslair lies a great complex of goblin learning known as Snotfinger University.

 H89_idea_5:0 "The Battle of Steelhyl"
 H89_idea_5_desc:0 "During the great war between Slozklan and Unguldavor, Slozklan initially experienced great success, blitzing through orcish defenses using terrifying war machines and hordes of goblins. However when the orcs rallied, they pushed the Slozklan armies all the way back to Steelhyl. General Mit entrenched the Slozklan armies upon the hill, and cleverly baited the commander of the orcish left flank into attacking before the rest of the orcish army arrived. The glorious victory won there that day paved the way for Slozklan's purge of orcs from Inner Castanor"
 H89_idea_6:0 "Trade Through The Khugsroad"

After making it, Slobald quickly, and fatally, discovered the lethal side effects of continued consumption of Gojuice.\n\nThankfully his daughter and lab assistant, Nopels, realized that the invention could still have applications. It is now used to help Slozklan soldiers run down retreating enemies,giving them a burst of speed and energy to ensure that none of the enemy escape to fight again."

 H84_idea_4:0 "The Jakzon Triskaidecagon"
 H84_idea_4_desc:0 "Invented by none other than Pether Jakzon, the Jakzon Triskaidecagon is a strange and seemingly impractical formation more suited to a parade ground than actual warfare. The level of coordination and leadership needed to successfully implement the formation means that it challenges even expert generals, making it a great challenge for up-and-coming officers to practice their ability to lead in the confused chaos of battle."
 H84_idea_5:0 "Army Bands"
 H84_idea_5_desc:0 "Ever since the reforms of Pether Jakzon, the armies of Divlklan have been accompanied by large bands of musicians whose music serves to inspire the men.

 H84_idea_6:0 "The Great Generals"
 H84_idea_6_desc:0 "There have been many great generals in Divlklan's past. Jararar Tolzheen, whose leadership and clever use of magic lead to victory over Shattered Crown and the sacking of Amldihr. Pether Jakzon, whose flair for showmanship led him to stunning victories that reverberated throughout the known world. Gazdalk the White, who showed the Dwarfs of Gor Burad that magic still meant something against the might of industry. All these and less legendary figures have lead the armies of Divlklan.

This seaweed grows incredibly fast: whether it is from the magic of Aelantir or simply the fertile water is debated. Seaweed is harvested by the Kairncali in the oceans, but the vast majority of it is grown on terraced plantations on land.

The Chipped Tooth Company was originally based in Anbenncóst; moreover, many of the original group of half-orc colonists were born or resident there, specifically in The Bilge.

While this style was also adopted by the Jaddari, the legions of the Sunrise Empire proper focused in the collective values of the Halessi peoples and incorporated the ritualistic gestures of the Righteous Path in their drilling techniques, making them a fierce opponent in the field.\n\nTheir most famous technique was the 'Burning Dragon Technique', which was essentially a fire-and-advance tactic done at an incredibly fast pace, allowing an entire regiment to continously fire on the enemy whilst getting into melee range."

Unfortunately, Jaerel's stance was only seen as a failure to choose a side, which saw many of his allies from all sides abandon him.\nTimes have changed however, and as the world is led by the scions of Anbennar, a realm created to bring peace and equality, perhaps Haless will now see that All Are Equals Beneath the Rising Sun."

Assumed to be greatly inspired when Jaerel's alliances collapsed when he refused to choose a side (he chose unity, rather than being pro-elven, for example), which saw his allies return to nationalistic and cultural affiliations, he had hoped to present this proposal at Sarisung shortly before he was assassinated.\n\nNow that the Sunrise Empire shines ones again, perhaps Jaerel's ambition can now be realized."

While the concept of 'the weave' never reached popularity, the Monks of the Weaving Palm proved incredibly deadly in battle, evoking arcane spells through movements and gestures akin to chi and cultivation practices, using nothing but their internal energies, the arcane 'weave' in the air, rather than spell reagents and components."

Any foreigner who makes their way to Zanbar quickly becomes familiar with the ever-present response upon mentioning their origin — "Ah, I have a cousin there!""

She was married young, and widowed, childless, only a few years later. With an indomitable will — and a natural talent with the spear — she found a place in Kalib's army, quickly rose through the ranks, and become widely known as a hero due to her leadership in skirmishes with the southern gnolls. Upon the previous Akal's death without a clear heir, she marched towards the palace: beginning as a solitary figure with a tall spear, and ending at the head of a mass thousands-strong. Her claim was incontestable.\n\nAs Akal, she revitalized Kalib's merchant guilds, struck up a personal friendship with Taelarios Irrliazuir, and made sure every peasant knew they could aspire to greatness. The last is her true legacy, as no Kalibi is likely to forget her tale anytime soon."

From djinni teeth to vials of Jaher's blood to peculiar variants of Damestear, the goods it sells are unique in all Halann.\n\nIts clientele included merchants and adventurers, pilgrims and scholars, and by the 17th century, even witch-kings' envoys and Ravelian artificers would on occasion seek it out.

But nothing is more diverse than the currencies: a dozen merchant caravans arriving at the city's gates might use two dozen currencies between them, and all seek to trade in Kalib.\n\nIn response to this, the state-run bank of Kalib has been given wide authority to engage in currency regulation and conversion.

But every so often, they do something that makes all Bulwari think they might just deserve their self-possession.\n\nThe most prominent such example is the battle of Wuk, against a gnollish incursion under the command of Zurrek. The battle was lost almost as soon as it began: elven blademasters overwhelmed by the dog-demons' numbers, human steel no match for the ferocity of tooth and claw. The allied forces began to turn tail and flee, but the Kalibi stood strong.\n\nEven as they fell by the dozens, the hundreds, they did not break, the did not budge. They were slaughtered to a man, their blood well-watering the earth, their corpses devoured by their foes, but in doing so they ensured their brothers could fight another day — and that every future Kalibi would demand similar levels of bravery of themselves."

A master glassblower learned of the God Fragment's teachings from the Cannorian merchants he traded with, and in his newfound zealousness, he felt the 'magic' of his craft must be made accessible to all. He published a manuscript detailing how the addition of gold salts during the glass-forming process lends the product a distinctive crimson shade — but even with the secret out, no new cathedral was worthy of its name without Azanerdu glass."

Since those early days it has flourished, even despite the various warlords of Rahen and the theft of their secrets. In the renewed Harimraj, it has become a rival to Dhenijansar itself in its magnificence, due to its nigh-monopoly on the realm's silk supply.\n\nRedglades silk might be cheaper, Bulwari silk more plentiful.

Still, for most, it is largely associated with Harimar the Great.\n\nDuring his rapid conquests after unifying the harimari living in the Jungles of Ascension, Sardiphadin was one of the first major cities to bow to his rule.

This served two purposes: they could avoid working with those untrustworthy thieves, and also maximize their own profits.

They already know the secrets of silk-production, so there are no costs to letting them into Sardiphadin's inner-most sanctums, and they are sworn to protect their charge with their lives. At its peak, the Harimraj banned such practices, treating the Bhuvauri more as foe than friend, but as the ministries grew corrupt Sardiphadin was quick to take advantage. A number of companies have been on direct retainer from Bhuvauri for decades now, and these contracts are the bedrock of Sardiphadin's defenses.\n\nSome thought to reconsider this arrangement after the "Typhoon of Broken Vases" in 1699 AA, when the Bhuvauri were bribed by Lorent with vast sums of money and exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their employers in the Porcelain Cities (recompense for the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage).

And each, of course, needed a new flag to symbolize their new status.\n\nSardiphadin was always quick to leap at this opportunity. One of the first envoys each new monarch would receive was a silk-merchant from Sardiphadin, bearing a rendition of the new banner in finest silk. This gift would pay great dividends — Sardiphadin could expect an order for more renditions within a year, and it always ingratiated these rising powers to the City of Silk."

But most notable is the coming-of-age ritual every male and female Tudhinai goes through at age sixteen: they must spend three days alone in the desert, with only a single waterskin and a loincloth.

But although they were not heavy-handed in their rule, and sought to win over the populace with lavish festivals and generous policies, the Tudhinai chafed nonetheless.\n\nRooted in the Unbroken Claw school's long-standing grudge with the Radiant Sun, the shepherds were often late in their taxes, only paid lip service to Jadd rituals, and nigh-refused to join its legions.

The numerous customs and polite civilities that make up Bulwari culture tend to always be respected... at least in public.\n\nFor the most part, the way an Azkabari citizen is expected to behave is only enforced by social pressure — except in the armed forces, where even a small mistake can carry with it harsh punishment: from extensive fines, to banishment, to outright execution.

The corridors that separate the cells are not patrolled by humans or even elves… but by ominous spectral creatures, with an almost blank face dominated by a gigantic mouth that devours the hopes and dreams of its victims. They were conjured by spellcasters to drive the prisoners to madness to prevent them from using their magical powers to attempt any form of escape, and whatever magics were used, they still persist to this day."

Many of them saw this as betraying the New Sun-Cult ways, which forbid slavery. On top of this, King Kalinael's early death led to a succession war between Re'uyel nobility and the king of Baharkand to press his queens claim, leading to increased war taxes and conscription.

By contrast it has a very long coastline so in ancient times the majority of the locals lived in fishing villages along the coast, with their homes fortified and camoflaged against raids of neighbouring clans. It was only a next logical step that their shipping boats quickly became vessels of piracy with the rise of rich shipping lanes through the gulf of glass and the port of Brasan.

This alliance lasted for many years until Jexis expelled the last gnolls from the peninsula after the request of many merchants from Brasan and Anbenncóst. Their ire had been drawn by a certain gnollish pirate captain, who was known as Korzorra the Scourge of Eborthil. Korzorra had been plaguing the shipping lanes around the islands of Eborthil greatly disrupting the trade through the Divenhal.

Anzabad has never forgotten, nor forgiven, them for this crime.\n\nAt its best, this rivalry pushes every Anzabadi merchant to perform to the utmost, knowing any deal around the Divenhal which does not dock at our ports may very well dock at theirs.

And this belief is only reinforced by the sunlily berry, one of the more interesting and curious plants native to the region.\n\nWhen consumed, the berry grants a man the energy to go through an entire day, requiring no other food and only a small libation of water. No doubt this is a small emanation of Surael himself, all his life-giving energies condensed into one small ounce of creation.

He rallied the troops left to garrison the city, overthrew the governor and managed to carve himself a kingdom centered around the northern part of the Šad Sur.\n\nIn the following centuries, the small mountainous Akalate became richer and richer thanks to the gold mine in Šad Uraš and slave trade, until most of it fell in the early 9th century to a gnollish invasion led by Jix the Goldseeker.\n\nToday, the majority of the people of the Šad Sur have deserted the mountains due to the repeated gnollish raids, but the traditions forged by Barseen still remain."

When Barseen took control of the place, it was little more than a pile of ruins. His son Bavar I, with his Akalate flourishing, ordered the restoration of the old fortress and turned it into a palace.

He rose quickly in the ranks, imposing the guards' discipline on a small regiment of his own.

Setting up targets further and further away, they compete and hone one another.\n\nDeggarion was particularly keen on this game, and at the head of his own regiment, ensured every soldier learned a sniper's accuracy.

Hiring engineers from the Gnomish Hierarchy, along with some of the architects working on Anbenncóst's skyscrapers, she devised a great lighthouse to illuminate the shores of Bahar and shine like a beacon to attract ships to Aqatbar.\n\nPlaced on the northern island of Fajabahar province, Aben-Ail, it took a decade to build but would be instrumental in raising Aqatbar's status to compete with the declining metropolis of Brasan. At the beacon's center lays a massive crystal, where a fist-sized chunk of damestear rumored to have been stolen from the deposits at Adráil powers the entire edifice."

Once our land was a loyal vassal of Dorcurt, with our Sonad Urian Oakgardner assisting his liege Ladrana Emberborn in uniting the disparate entities of the Autumn Court together. Ladrana Emberborn had invited the premier statesman of the Tuathak in Dorcurt for negotiations, stressing that action must be taken to curb the influence of the Arakepruni and bolster the Hibernal states hold over the north. In a different timeline, Ladrana would be remembered as the uniting matriarch of the Tuathak: but she was already too late and did not notice their eminent demise.\n\nWhilst the Tuathak leaders were gathered in Dorcurt, a Peitar army struck from the depths of the Domandrod. The folly of Dorcurt was the assumption that no large forces could arrive from the Domandrod because of the restrictions on entry enforced by the Gladewardens and fey spirits within. The Tuathak Legion guards were quickly overwhelmed, unprepared to fight such a large force so quickly, and almost all those gathered at the conclave were murdered by the balance-obsessed zealots. The Sonad of Raithtall, Urian Oakgardner fought to avenge his comrades, but was pierced with a poisoned blade. Miraculously, Urian was recovered and returned to Raithtall by a trusted compatriot, but lived the last few years of his life infirm and in constant pain. Upon his deathbed Urian could still see the smoke above the golden forests, and made his son Dharastor swear to avenge him and the all those that fell at Dorcurt."

Eighard stood as the bulwark of the Autumn Court against the unrelenting wintry winds for centuries, until matters of fate thrust them into greatness. Their hated enemies, the Snecboth, were lulled into a feeling of false safety, believing that they had nothing to fear from the Tuathak who cowered in their fortresses until the end of winter. Eighard developed a plan, gathering support from the old Autumn Court of Dorcurt and gathering a vast army of the faithful. A holy war to end the Winter once and for all was declared: once the Snecboth and their lands were conquered by Eighard and their allies, they could end their idolatry and cease the hated season forever!\n\nThe Hibernal Crusade won victory after victory, crushing the Winter Court and seizing the lands eastward towards what would become Jhorgashirr and Slegcal. All that remained was Gemradcurt, but the Esbagg of Eighard, Andrall Harvestcrown, knew that their allies would seize their conquered lands and sought to force their loyalty at Minnorac, the Field of Oaths. This proved to be a cataclysmic mistake, for they were ambushed there by the Strutmar Peitar and the unity of the Hibernal Crusade was shattered with the death of Esbagg Andrall Harvestcrown.\n\nFollowing the ambush at Minnorac, the remaining leadership of the Hibernal Crusade rushed to consolidate power and seized control of the conquered lands, forming the traitorous states of Jhorgashirr and Slegcal.

Contact with the peoples of the Ynnic river valley spread tales of Dracball, supposedly having slain a mighty dragon at war with the Rzentur centuries ago! Raising his host in the far north near the Broken Sea in 1782, Darran Eaglesthorn marched into Dragon Dominion lands towards Arganjuzorn, intent on retrieving the legendary sword. While the Rzentans proved to be untrustworthy vassals, breaking their oaths near instantly, the people of Arganjuzorn recognized their status as subjects to Slegcal. Agreements were made with the Dragon Dominion to allow Slegcaler movement along the upper Ynn, and the first Eordan embassy was established in Svemel.\n\nAt last victorious, Darran drew Dracball from its hilt and spent nearly a month testing it against the monsters of the Epednar plains, including slaying a mighty Poskawa Whale, a gigantic mountain-like fish monster that blends into the rockfields. When news of Cannorian mercenaries invading Slegcal reached Darran, he returned home to face off these invaders but was already too late.

The citadel of Dungat, the Winter Gate to the Domandrod, was the site where the first Eordan left the mystical forest with hope in a new future; now the imposing Gate solemnly towers over the horizon as a personification of the stubborness of the Strutmar Peitar. When long ago all their cousins turned to champion the Winter and others took to arms in the name of Autumn, the Strutmari remained resolute in their vow to uphold the balance of the seasons. When the world erupted into war and death, the Strutmari wept for their wayward cousins.\n\nThe gleaming gate, evershifting between every color in the rainbow, shines brightly against the dark, cold land. Behind it may lie a paradise that the Strutmari could retreat to, but the guard will keep watch until their last breath, for they will never abandon the land of promise and hope."

But the Hibernal Crusade forced them to take action, with the near-total triumph of the Autumn Court over Winter. The Peitar tribes gathered to discuss what action to take to curb the expansion of the Autumn Court, and designated Strutmar with the responsibility to take their main force head-on. Hopelessly outmatched, the Strutmari waited and watched for an opportunity... and found one when the leadership of the Hibernal Crusade was gathered by the Esbagg of Eighard at Minnorac, the Field of Oaths, to swear loyalty to him.\n\nTheir Tuathak Legions, heavily armored and disciplined phalanxes, stood watch towards the cold forest whilst their commanders bowed and prostrated. Almost unnoticed, the Tuathak leadership fell to hidden arrow and blade, and their forces soon found themselves surrounded on either side by the Strutmari. To this day, Minnorac is known as Autumn's Grave, where the Hibernal Crusade was shattered before its victory."

Located above a scenic, and symbolic, intersection of rivers, the participants in each case are constantly warned by the churning waters beneath.

This is hardly a disadvantage, for the Trimgarbers have specialized in manipulating the winds to stir up clouds of sand and dust.\n\nWhile useful when fighting in melee, the sandstorms are an obscuring cloud that allows for sharpshooters to remain hidden and to continuously find hidden positions. Foreign musketeers used to rigid formations or the shield of a tree find themselves hopelessly exposed, displayed best at the Skirmish at Sicranach of 1689 when both regulars and irregulars of the Pearlsedger expedition fired hopelessly into the sandstorm."

Bluewool is sheared from the wooly horned sheep native to the Egasach, although only a few out of every hundred grow blue wool.

Admitted to the Taigan Order and an extraordinarily young age of five, Immarel impressed and soon behumbled the high-court druids with her near limitless Wintry magic. Growing up during war with the Autumnal fanatics, Immarel became embittered and resentful, unlike the peaceful patient norm of the Winter Court.\n\nRecognizing her potential, the militarists of Gemradcurt nurtured her rage, and at the age of 11 she had bested the previous Sonad in single combat after becoming frustrated with his inability to combat the Hibernal Crusaders. Immarel and the militarists seized control of the Winter Court, and soon drove out the invaders, ending their advance northward.

Svemelic elves believe that the city was marked as eternally protected by the dragon against those who enter Svemel with harmful intentions.

But later Svemel was bestowed with an even greater prize - to be the capital and beating heart of the Dragon Dominion. For the Rzentur people Svemel acts as a cultural and religious centre, both as the place where Drozma Tur originated from and its central position in the lands populated by Rzentur elves.

Named “The Scaled Walls”, in reverence of the dragon that once saved the city, they use bricks made in a scaled pattern to reinforce the idea that Drozma always protects the city.\n\nThe first time Scaled Walls saw action was during the Istranari Crusade of 1622, when the Corinite zealots seized the chaos of the War of the Bacaran Succession and invaded Dominion lands in the name of their goddess and laid siege to Svemel. The project was proved to be a success as the Scaled Walls protected the city with the Istranari suffering high casualties and retreating after a year long siege."

During their stay in Svemel, the Green Terror and son of the dragon-god Drozmagog, Varlengeilt, arrived in the city with a speech. During the speech an attempt on his life was made by the Corinite rebels, who failed and proceeded to flee. The brothers decided to intervene and deployed their traps, managing to capture the rebels and bring them to Svemelic city guard.\n\nImpressed by these artifice inventions Varlengeilt granted them an audience. The brothers, seeking an opportunity of a lifetime, asked to build a center of artificery led by them. The dragon, who usually masqueraded in ruinborn form, seeing the practical use of artificery and perhaps kinship with his misbegotten cousins, granted their wish. The city of Svemel sponsored the construction of the first kobold artificer guild in the Dragon Dominion. Soon after, plenty of Greenscale Kobolds migrated to the city and worked under the Bronzeclaw Brothers’ leadership."

However, the project was not taken well by the clergy and Varlengeilt himself, seeing mimicking the dragons as borderline heretical. As a compromise, the Steel Dragons lost wings and any attempt at fire breath and simply became a well made suit of armour used more frequently in Svemelic army than the previous model ever could have been."

With the arrival of Drozmagog, the living dragon god of the Rzentur people, came the idea that a powerful new state could be forged under its guidance, with the Rzentur people in its center.

By the time it did, this composite army was already too big to not give it support without risking having their holding sacked for “standing in the way of the Dragon’s will”. Some of those lords gave the army supplies and safe passage through their lands, while others joined the totality of their force to them.\n\nThis army, despite being massive, was heavily infantry based, as well as plagued by organisation issues. So when they were confronted by the smaller but better equipped Dolindhan coalition, an otherwise unlikely defeat occurred.

We lived closely with our people and learned to share in our resources and tribulations, so it was no surprise that when we came to Haraf that the gnomes and goblins went their usual way in their treatment of the ruinborn - seeing them as lessers or a thing to get rid of.

Rocks replaced with shrapnel bombs, tripwires replaced with laser sensors, and pressure plates made into land mines.

Losing a paw in a duel to the soon-to-be Emperor, he submitted to Harimar's rule, going from major warlord to a minor lieutenant during the conquest of Rahen. But the wound Brajar took never fully healed, and a few years later, it festered until he died of infection.\n\nHis son, Vamayur, was more talented with pen and parchment than sword and shield, and came to Harimar's attention just as he was beginning to be faced with the challenges of governing all his conquered lands. Vamayur was instrumental in drafting the Harimraj's first set of laws and ordinances, many of which are still in force today. It was for this service, not any of his father's military deeds, that his dynasty earned the lands of Pasiragha, and furthermore, through intricate loopholes and clever designs he ensured it a place of prominence in the court beyond its seeming stature.\n\nNear the end of his life, Vamayur compiled his lessons and wisdom into a tome, Vamayur's Codex, which was passed down from generation to generation, and from senapti to senapti during the latter Harimraj. Though said to be secret, over the centuries a few copies were made — finding their way into a certain estate's bookshelves in Sramya, and a constant guide to the young Senapti Mahapalar of the Flower Oath — and once the printing press arrived in Rahen, it was disseminated far and wide, even making it to the eunuch training schools at Tianlou.

These quickly became a staple of the Raheni political scene, and by the early 1700s, a pamphlet printed in Pasiragha could be found inspiring debate and discussion in Srayen or Sarisung within days of its creation."

In Khiraspid, the focus is singular: quality. Even as porcelain became more common in Cannor, following the rush of Cannor-Halessi trade in the 17th century and the opening of the Anbari Emdovu canal, Khiraspid porcelain remained on a tier of its own. The richest Lencori wine-lords, the haughtiest Escanni witch-kings, the most exacting gnomish artificers — all would seek out wares marked with the city's signature identifier: a circle at the center of a horizontal oval.

There are repeated rumours of eyes in the dark, glowing watchers disappearing when you try to bring them into focus. There are no reports of who might bear them or where they come from, but most citizens have seen them once or twice, and almost all swear by their existence. Nonetheless, they disappear when dawn comes and the city's porcelain decorations — each marked with the stamp of Khiraspid workshops — are illuminated by sunlight once more."

But with the Harimraj collapsing, and encroaching conquerors from all directions, we cannot risk that the porcelain secret might someday be seized by force.

Even the legendary scholar-boats of the Kharunyana, where the age's wisest philosophers debate as they lazily cruise down the great river, are not exempted from paying a fee. Though irritating to foreigners, they have little choice in the matter, and this lucrative practice fills Khiraspid's coffers."

 R26_the_white_gate_desc:0 "During the old days of the Rahenraj, millennia ago, many of the major forts of Dhujat grew into cities in their own right. Especially after the conflicts between the Rahenraj and the kingdoms east of it, around 600 BA, Khiraspid was fortified to the point of having some of the thickest and tallest walls. Within it, the porcelain workers felt safe to revel in their riches. But everything changed when Harimar attacked.\n\nThough the walls were insurmountable, the gates were not. The harimari troops quickly breached the city's mighty gates, and quickly overran its defences. But Harimar was a benevolent conqueror, and he saw the value of a kind example in bringing the rest of the Porcelain Cities under his paw. Instead of sacking the city, he allowed its rulers to proclaim him sovereign. Then, before he left, he ensured the shattered gates would be rebuilt out of pure porcelain, a shining white beacon so that all would remember how quickly he had seized the city — and his mercy afterward.\n\nThe days of the old Harimraj are long gone now, but the White Gate still stands, the symbol of Khiraspid and harder than any wood or stone. And though hobgoblins threaten from the north, zealots threaten from the east, Khiraspid's White Gate will stand strong, nigh-insurmountable, against them."

Still others reside in dense, dark, slums. But all are mandated to serve in the city guard from the ages eighteen to twenty. Not a single individual, no matter their fitness or position, is allowed to shun this duty, and it ensures that Khiraspid never goes without a well-manned guard.\n\nThe other Porcelain Cities often looked down on this practice, which meant an apprentice porcelain-worker would share a spear with a street urchin, especially when mercenary forces and Bhuvauri slave soldiers were well-trained, plentiful, and cheap. But it would pay off in 1699 AA, when following the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage, Lorent paid the Bhuvauri a vast sum and promised them exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their would-be masters and sack the city of Keyattordha. That city was left ravaged, and the slave soldiers also looted a few others as they abandoned the Porcelain Guilds' contracts in full. After the "Typhoon of Broken Vases", as the event became known, Khiraspid alone stood untouched."

Oh, how wrong they were. \n\nThrough his family's connections, however distant, he was able to secure enough funding to make this expedition succeed, and thanks to increasing Bulwari and Sun Elf emigration we were able to gather enough people to survive and thrive in these distant lands. \n\nThough a merchant by trade, Saamir also happened to be a student of history and somewhat of an expert in the field of Genie and Precursor artifacts. This came in very handy when searching these ruin-scorched isles for relics, which are key to deciphering the Precursor Elves' ancient secrets. \n\nThe less useful baubles will fetch a good price back home in Bulwar, where many new stores bearing our founder's name are being opened to sell them."

The battle was decidedly in Zanlib's favour, and the Saamiršes fleet suffered heavy losses to Zanlib's mirror arrays, which would easily burn our ships one by one.

Some would turn to piracy, and eventually even the goods seized from passing Cannorian trade vessels would also find their way to Brasan to be sold. \n\nUsing pirates to our advantage may be morally objectionable, there is no denying their effectiveness, so we shall look the other way, in exchange for a cut of the profits."

How can a man labour with no pay and a whip over his head? The practice of slavery is alien to Saamirses, and our plantations rely on the labour of paid workers instead, who are compensated fairly for their hard work.

The gnollish rule over Bulwar continued to wax and wane through centuries, until eventually being ended by the elves under Jaher. Defeated by Jaherian legions, gnolls ended up pushed into the hills and deserts on the outskirts of Bulwar with almost no city centres under direct control.\n\nAnd yet, we remain and remember.

Alas, all good things must come to an end.\n\nIn 1507 Tluukt's old enemies, the Jaddari, declared the final war against the gnolls in Bulwar. While some traitorous gnolls sided with the elves and accepted the Jadd, the loyal gnolls of Tluukt fought to the last soldier, but despite their ferocity were pushed back all the way into the recently restored Ekluzagnu.

Calling themselves 'Varbuk's Freemen', they moved around Dalaire freeing other slaves and causing havoc on the colonists. The revolt was seeing plenty of success until the colonial armies managed to secure few key victories and pushing former slaves deeper into Dalaire. \n\nHaving nowhere else to go, Varbuk led his men into the Cursed Forest.

However, that was not the case. \n\nAfter several years of traversing the forest and fighting off the locals, Freemen have emerged on the other side.

Fortunately, Freemarches wasn't the only country with desire to tame the forest. \n\nGnome from the Broken Sea faced the same problem of Cursed Ones' raids and resistance. To combat them, they invented the Bond Breaker - a small metallic rod that oeprates at the same frequency as Kinbond, distracting and confusing the affected Cursed Ones for a short period of time. The rod however could work only at a short distance. In order to properly test and utilise this new invention gnomes needed to get close enough to the Cursed Ones.\n\nNot willing to waste their own lives for this, the artificers contacted Freemarches with an offer. They would employ some half-orcs and have them venture into the forest alongside gnomish expeditions to act as a protection against the Cursed Ones, and in return gnomes would provide some Bond Breakers for Freemarcher use. Half-orcs have accepted gnomish offer, and this dual endeavor greatly decreased half-orcish losses against their old enemies."
