  G56_1_1_looking_outwards_title: "Looking Outwards" #By: Takasaki
  G56_1_1_looking_outwards_desc: "Deyeion has always been in a precarious position, surrounded on all sides by the Basobhar menace, and watched over by Degakheioni tyrants. While we have always regarded these threats as being equal, with our overlord's successes on Alecand it is becoming increasingly clear that if we do not look outwards, they will tighten their grip on our city - simply put, we must expand into the barbarous lands to the north, and expand our own strength at their expense.\n\nThough our own people must be at the forefront of this, and we generally regard our "brothers" in Eneion and Degakheion with distaste, that does not mean there aren't like-minded people among them, struggling for freedom even while everyone else is content to sit under a tyrant's boot - finding these people and bringing them over here will be most useful."
  G56_1_4_return_the_favor_title: "Return the Favor" #By: Takasaki
  G56_1_4_return_the_favor_desc: "They may have been encroaching on their lands, they may have been doing so without our permission, but does that really justify the wholesale slaughter of our colonists? The Mteibhar are proving to be formidable and dangerous opponents indeed - and if we are to protect our lands and finalize our conquest of Devand, we must be ruthless in our pursuit of the natives. If that begins with us returning the favour delivered upon us at Vexydhan, then so be it."
  G56_1_5_into_the_valley_title: "Into the Valley" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_1_5_into_the_valley_desc: "When the Mteibhar raided our homes and crashed against Deyeion's very gates, they did more than ravage our nation: they planted dreams of vengeance in each soul within our Nékheis. But it is not an easy task to transmute a dream into reality; No, the Kheions' Wind Wards weren't enchanted in a day, after all. As we reclaim our former territory deeper and deeper inland, we prepare to strike those crag-dwelling vipers with unerring patience. Before our victory parade, our campaign must hem in Mteibhara and their allies. March, citizens of Deyeion! Unto the interior!"
  G56_1_6_and_the_walls_fall_down_title: "And The Walls Fall Down" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_1_6_and_the_walls_fall_down_desc: ""Seasons passed, the hordes laid waste, unto noble gates, justice missed our date. As ashes flitted across the breeze, they stoked our hearts, to offer no reprieve. Against the flow, upon the rivers, unto their hills, scorching all in cinders. Their barbarous cries, fading as they run, o'er their mountains to doom now done. Done and dusted, the ashes lay, upon the valleys where we set their grave." -Gozarali the Lesser, contemporary Deyeion poet commenting on Deyeion's conquest of the Mteibhar peoples"

  G56_2_2_claim_the_mainland_title: "Claim the Mainland" #By: Takasaki
  G56_2_2_claim_the_mainland_desc: "The Basobhar are strong opponents, doggedly fighting for every inch of Devand - but we must not forget the more powerful foes who would set their eyes on the very same land we are both shedding blood for. If we are to protect our gains, we and our allies must secure the coast of Devand, and make sure we are not vulnerable to threats from the sea."
  G56_2_3_arm_the_army_title: "Arm the Army" #By: Takasaki
  G56_2_3_arm_the_army_desc: "Now that the Basobhar around us are dealt with, we are faced with even more difficult opponents. To our north lie the Mteibhar, more organised and better equipped than their southern kin, but more importantly lie the other Nékheis and their Kheionai overlords.\n\nThough they were settled under slightly more voluntary circumstances than us, that does not mean they do not labour and toil under the oppressive boot of the Kheions on Alecand. Even worse, some - our erstwhile kin in Eneion most of all - have become content with Alecandi domination, and act openly as agents of the mainland. We must change this situation by force of arms, and that means we need the arms to do it."
  G56_2_4_reaching_out_title: "Reaching Out" #By: Takasaki
  G56_2_4_reaching_out_desc: "If we are to liberate Devand, the borderlands between the Andic Reach and the Devandi west coast are integral to our plan. Not only must the Basobhar presence in the region be suppressed, but the land itself must be protected and guarded - after all, any Kheionai army on the march towards our capital must surely pass through there. By colonising the region and constructing great fortifications there, we can ensure our future endeavours wil be successful."
  G56_2_5_free_the_slavers_title: "Free the Slavers" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_2_5_free_the_slavers_desc: "What is sugar's worth? Three ducats? "A base asking price," the merchant at Keyolíon's docks say. Does arcanely pure cane earn a higher price? "Of course," Keyolíon's Institute of Agronomy decrees. Did it require much effort? "Only a dozen souls from planting to harvest," the slavers in Empkeios shrug. But we ask a single question: Is sugar worth freedom's bane? Keyolíon and Empkeios did more than ignore the bloody grease required to grow their sweet products; they perfected it. They may continue their blood trade using Devandi chattel, but no true elf can languish in chains from this day forth."

  G56_3_1_the_independence_movement_title: "Independence Movement" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_3_1_the_independence_movement_desc: "Degakheion: the mother Kheion, conqueror of Kimánis, founder of the first Nékhei, and, until recently, our overlord. By strength of arms, we've liberated our fair Nékhei from the old order of Alecand. But as the crowds cheer and our Kylakas ponders the next step, we realize our true place: not as spawn of Degakheion, but as the first of the Nékheis. We must labor so that all our brethren in the Andic Reach, Devand, and beyond look upon our fair Kheinisí with the same reverence we granted to our former overlords; no, more than that! Our fellow elves will see Deyeion as a sacred metonym of freedom and liberty. "
  G56_3_2_supporting_our_neighbors_title: "Supporting our Neighbors" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_3_2_supporting_our_neighbors_desc: "When Kimánis fell to Degakheion and Oktikheion, we reveled in our overlords victory. But as we've reexamined our former friends, so too do we consider our former foes. Why did we pine for their destruction? Simply because our mother Kheion ordained it? Did we truly wish to see their way of life destroyed? This national introspection hewed our path as a new people, apart from Alecand's resource-starved fueds. Only one other Nékhei wriggled free from the old Kheions: Amgremós, our former foes turned friends in this strange new era. And just as we've grappled with questions of our national identity, we guide our allies into learning from their past, pressing into the future as one."
  G56_3_3_likeminded_farmers_title: "Like-Minded Farmers" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_3_3_likeminded_farmers_desc: "The Iona Coast, a fertile and gentle land divided by crescent mountain ranges, mirrored Alecand's ancient Kheions in many ways. But as the Nékheis of Apikhoxí and Besolakí matured, they surpassed their roots as debt-slaves and backwater hunters divided by geography. Their skills as agriculturists and trailblazers are invaluable to our expansion efforts: true brother nations with whom we shall labor to forge a future for all elves in Devand! We only need to "relocate" their Alecandi loyalists to our frontiers; for their own sake and Deyeion's expansion."
  G56_3_4_stomp_out_the_bootlickers_title: "Stomp out the Bootlickers" #By: Takasaki
  G56_3_4_stomp_out_the_bootlickers_desc: "Eneion. Our "brothers". The favoured child. They favoured subjugation, they favoured tyranny, and why wouldn't they? They were not cast from the mainland in chains, they were not sent to the edge of the world as prisoners and exiles. They were the first, the greatest of the Nékheis. But the tide has turned - and now it is time we rectify their perceptions. It is time for the Eneioni to find out the price of collaboration."
  G56_3_5_crack_down_on_dissenters_title: "Crack Down on Dissenters" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_3_5_crack_down_on_dissenters_desc: "Reports poured in from loyal officials and spies across the country. From Empkeios to Amgremós, our allies rage at the news of Eneion's judgement. Worst of all, they call us the real tyrants in this affair; the indignity! After our efforts to liberate and enlighten our fellow Nékheis, is this their thanks? What fools we were to use a gentle hand. As our brother cities muster militias and draft declarations of war, Deyeion must ready liberty's tithe: the blood of traitors will water Devand, so that a new future dawns, free of tyranny's shadow."
  G56_3_6_a_free_theinos_title: "A Free Theínós" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_3_6_a_free_theinos_desc: "An Andic sparrow, nesting in a bountiful orchard in Basýnaran, chirps gleefully in the morning twilight. A bitter-blue carp, staple of the Cleaved Seas, splashes against a fisher's line. A mountain wind buffets a cozy bonfire, the family of vacationing elves marveling at the Dikhéis' majesty. But these fleeting sparks can be extinguished so long as tyrrany exists in the world. As the Nékheis become elders to even newer burgeoning cities, Deyeion eternally labors to guide the backward, the ungrateful, and the ignorant. We can never sit idle, never cease, so long as threats linger at our border; Long live Deyeion's liberty!"

  G56_4_1_looking_for_help_title: "Looking For Help" #By: Takasaki
  G56_4_1_looking_for_help_desc: "Though we know the day when we finally throw off our shackles is drawing near, we are not foolish - Degakheion is a mighty city, and their soldiers mightier. If we are to defeat them, it is imperative that we seek allies. Thankfully, we have two such states right next door. With Amgremós' parent city vanquished in part due to the actions of Degakheion, and Ameion always looking to secure their western borders, they have reason to join our cause - all we need is to give them a push."
  G56_4_2_the_echate_league_title: "The Échate League" #By: Takasaki
  G56_4_2_the_echate_league_desc: "How many philosophical treatese have been written about the ambitious hearts of elves? Though the barbhen in Taychend were consumed by it, us Kheionai have been known to harbour a similar affliction. It is no wonder, then, that with Deyeion ascendant in the west and Ameion successful in the east, elves from both states would wish to decide once and for all whom shall come out on top. But what if we take a different course? Avoid conflict today, and come to an equitable arrangement? The Échate League shall achieve this, defining spheres of control in the Andic Reach and warding off a potential conflict. Of course, persuading Ameion to sign it may be more difficult than we anticipate..."
  G56_4_3_the_naval_nekhei_title: "The Naval Nékhei" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_4_3_the_naval_nekhei_desc: "When we still required shipments from our Kheion, the Cleaved Sea, filled with alcoves and islands, served as a logistical nightmare during wartime, and no greater thorn to shipping existed among our elven neighbors than Anisíkheion: a string of islands protected by peerless sailors and Kherka's might, they appeared unconquerable. But times change. By diplomacy and force, we've bested their ships, outgunned their defenders, and brought the island Kheion to heel. Before we can sever them from their old Kheion's influence, we must gracefully instruct them upon their new role as an integral part in our Nékheion brotherhood. How grateful Anisíkheion shall be when they taste the liberty we offer."
  G56_4_4_take_back_the_islands_title: "Take Back the Islands" #By: Goshgollydarnit
  G56_4_4_take_back_the_islands_desc: ""Civilization sails upon the tides of change," or so the old adage goes. Though often taken metaphorically, it holds an anchor of hard truth: all Kheionai endure thanks to the Cleaved Sea. But it is not enough for Deyeion to sail the endless blue; No, every fishing village, perilious strait, and urban port must accept our guiding authority. With the seas under one Kheion, we hope to provide the security and guidance necessary to unite the disparate islanders...and command both Alecand's and Devand's future."
  G56_4_5_promote_tea_cultivation_title: "Promote Tea Cultivation" #By: Takasaki
  G56_4_5_promote_tea_cultivation_desc: "Our efforts in expanding native tea production have, to say the least, been extremely successful. Already we are starting to outpace - and outsell - our competitors over in Taychend, and we are only getting started.\n\nOur suveryors and landowners have already eagerly marked out new locations for tea plantations across our lands - soon, we shall have a stronger claim to the mantle of "Tea-Land" than those barbarians in the east ever did!"

  G56_5_1_new_trade_partners_title: "New Trade Partners" #By: Takasaki
  G56_5_1_new_trade_partners_desc: "For nearly 800 years now, Taychendi and Kheionai ships alike have crossed the southern seas, bringing all manner of goods between the two great civilisations of the known world. But for all that time, our trading opportunities have been largely limited to the southern coast.\n\nBut with our neighbours in Ameion conquering ever deeper into the region, our traders are in a prime position to capitalise on his forceful "expansion" of the Kheionai world. Let us make some new friends in the region, so that we may line our pockets - and fill our cups. "
  G56_5_4_tea_from_taychend_title: "Tea from Taychend" #By: Takasaki
  G56_5_4_tea_from_taychend_desc: "Taychend is quite literally the land of tea, vast plantations growing the crop throughout that region. And though we have grown our own native leaves since we discovered the drink's splendor, our production has always paled in comparison to our neighbours across the sea.\n\nNo longer - as we expand across Devand, and our economic might expands, we must leverage our newfound power and devote it to a field dear to every Deyeioni citizen - the production of tea!"
  G56_5_6_only_the_best_title: "Only the Best" #By: Takasaki
  G56_5_6_only_the_best_desc: "It is a beautiful thing, to be successful in an endeavour. Since our people first tasted tea, we have all coveted it, from the richest citizen to the lowliest peasant - and for centuries we have tried our hardest to expand our production of the leaves needed to produce it. Now, we produce nearly as much tea as those in Taychend do, our reliance on imported leaves nearly entirely destroyed.\n\nBut in focusing on the quanitity of tea we produce, we have neglected its quality. Not for one day more! We now control all of Devand, including the magically-enhanced fields of Keyolíon, and are in a superior position to the Taychendi, whose leaves may still be said to have a superior taste to ours - it is time to take the efforts of those around us and make our tea leaves the best in the world!"

  #Events
  deyeion_events.1.t: "An Offer of Friendship?" #By: Blaziy
  deyeion_events.1.d: "In front of [Root.Monarch.GetName] are two pieces of paper waiting to be signed. One, a deal with the pirates from the area, agreeing to give a portion of what they plunder to the state in exchange for immunity from prosecution. An awful deal to make, but one that must be done in order to maintain our sovereignty in this rapidly changing world.\n\nThe other though, an offer of vassalization from Deyeion. A quite pretentious offer coming from the country we just helped gain independence, but there are some good points to it. The Deyeioni were by far the strongest troops on any battlefield, and the thought of fighting them, as the Deyebhen diplomat hinted at if the offer was refused, would make any Amgrebhen soldier soil themselves. The other benefit is of the dream the Deyebhen Kylakas once shared with [Root.Monarch.GetName], one far more ambitious than [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had ever dreamed of, one of a united Devand. Free from Alecandi influence, stronger than their overlords could possibly imagine on their tiny island, much more rich and prosperous than even the most powerful Amgrebhen merchant could fathom, Theínós.\n\nAs night falls, it comes time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to grab [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ink and quill and chose."
  deyeion_events.1.a: "Let us accept Deyeion's offer"
  deyeion_events.1.b: " Amgremós will create Theínós ourselves!"

  deyeion_events.2.t: "Amgremós Accepts" #By: Takasaki
  deyeion_events.2.d: "Excellent news has come in from Amgremós - in light of our demonstrable military excellence, and the recent ties forged between our people in the recent war, they have decided that it would be prudent to... independently request our protection? Not quite a reply to our own "offer" of vassalisation, though given the Amgremósians have simply copied all of our conditions of vassalisation in the agreement, it seems we may as well humour their attempt to save face. It seems the Amgremósians have yielded to our dream of a united Devand, instead of resorting to a life picking the scraps of shipwrecks."
  deyeion_events.2.a: "Deyeion's dream may yet be fulfilled!"

  deyeion_events.3.t: "Amgremós Refuses" #By: Takasaki
  deyeion_events.3.d: "Bad news from Amgremós - seeing our offer of vassalisation as "both laughable and insulting", they have seen fit to reject it, with their Kylakas sending a rather strongly (and immaturely) worded letter of rejection. Though this may cast some dark clouds on our future ambitions of uniting Devand, there is little we can do now except enforce our rule by force. At least some among the military will be happy - Amgremós has become quite rich off of their privateering recently, and there has never been a better time to part those riches from them."
  deyeion_events.3.a: "They’ll come to regret this in time"
  deyeion_events.3.b: "War it is, then."

  deyeion_events.4.t: "The Échate League" #By: Takasaki
  deyeion_events.4.d: "[G52.Monarch.GetName] dipped [G52.Monarch.GetHerHis] quill quickly in the ink, then went back to writing the historical copy of the treaty creating the Échate League. 2 years of Deyebhen diplomatic effort, and 3 more years of internal Ambhen political wrangling, was finally coming to an end. Debated over for years in the Synkletos and defeated twice in the Public Assembly, only recently had the Ambhen Kylakas managed to forge a compromise that suited all parties. When [G52.Monarch.GetName] finished writing, [G52.Monarch.GetSheHe] scribbled [G52.Monarch.GetHerHis] signature at the bottom of the scroll, then passed quill, ink and paper over to the [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Once [G52.Monarch.GetSheHe] had done so, the ruler of Ameion stood, taking a glass of wine and walking over to the window.\n\n“You’d think it would be easier,” the Ambhen Kylakas said, as [G52.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked out over the harbor. Hundreds of ships passed through the port gates, heading east to Taychend or west back to the Nékheis and Kheions. “For centuries, we’ve sought a stable border and good relations with our western brothers. Now we have the former, but the senate and people of Ameion try to prevent the latter at every turn.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] shrugged. “I suppose its not surprising. You Ambhen have had an expansionist streak of late, as have we. Isn’t too far fetched to imagine we may come to blows.” The Deyebhen Kylakas signed the document, then stood, walking over to stand next to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Ambhen counterpart. “But we choose a different path. And, with much convincing, your people have as well. We have Devand, you have Taychend, and our cousins in Alecand can keep their deathwind-damned island to themselves.”\n\n“For now.” [G52.Monarch.GetName] said, as [G52.Monarch.GetSheHe] took a sip of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wine and watched the ships below. “We were once content with our city. Then Laskaris came, and we boarded those ships and set off to conquer half of Taychend. How long before you do the same? And we’ve both conquered half of Andeios, and all we have left is to kill each other and take the other half.” The Ambhen Kylakas shook [G52.Monarch.GetHerHis] head. “That’s beyond our lifetimes, though. So I’ll just take the victory and be done with it.”"
  deyeion_events.4.a: "And so the Échate League is born – may it last unto eternity."

  deyeion_events.5.t: "Remove the Cowards" #By: Takasaki
  deyeion_events.5.d: "When the walls of Eneion fell, its populace, elite and commoner alike, likely believed they would face the same fate as the other Nékheis overtaken by Deyeion's rising tide. Soldiers threw down their weapons, civilians locked themselves inside their homes, hid their valuables – but they knew Deyeion would be reasonable. And so the Deyeioni army surged towards the acropolis at the city's heart unopposed, where the Riárchis and his government had assembled to give the city up officially - peacefully. There was already carts full of gold, an agreement of surrender readied. “The last has overcome the first,” the Riárchis said, solemnly,  “and we accept this defeat. We hope that you will be merciful in your victory.” The Riárchis offered an outstretched hand. A Deyebhen soldier cut it off.\n\nNews of the slaughter in the Acropolis spread quickly, and soon a peaceful surrender turned to chaotic resistance. Steel spear-tips and bronze plate turned red with blood, as gray ash and bright flame choked the sky. Houses burned, fighter and frightened commoner alike slaughtered. Maybe the Deyeioni didn't plan for this destruction, but when the fighting and the fires started, they most certainly didn't do anything to stop it. After the last embers of resistance were over, the Deyebhen went house to house, breaking down doors and tearing people from their homes. The streets ran red with blood.\n\nSince its founding, the city of Eneion had found itself better than the other Nékheis, prided itself on its closeness to the mainland – to the city that sent us to the edge of the Kheionai world in chains. The first Nékhei in every way, always more civilised compared to their savage brothers out east – they were right, in a way, but as the blood running through Eneions streets shows, it is through strength and determination, not right or privilege, that one will rule Devand."
  deyeion_events.5.a: "And so the last overcomes the first."

  deyeion_events.6.t: "War for Revenge" #By: Takasaki
  deyeion_events.6.d: "As Eledas threw another body into the pit, he could hear the philosopher behind them giving his lecture. “The war for revenge!” he called. “The war for defence! This has precedence, brothers! Look to the example of our ancestors…!” Eledas walked back over to the rest of the Mteibhar, picked another from the pile – this one had been cut across the front. Died in battle, not in the slaughter that followed. Eledas grabbed the corpse by the legs and dragged it over. There were ten or so other soldiers working alongside him – more on the other side of Kanziyen. It was a big town, and there were a lot of bodies. Sweat drenched his blue skin, while the stench of decay assaulted him. Grim work.\n\n“When the Eltibhar united, and descended from Meteí,” the philosopher continued, “did Alecand take their attacks with indifference? Bury the dead and forget whom put them in the ground? No!” Eledas finished dragging the body over. It had left a trail of rot from pile to pit, but that was an issue for the incoming colonists, those who would turn Kanziyen to Kóianbaso. He turned the corpse on its side and kicked it into the mass grave. It landed with a squishy thump on top of the other bodies. “The Kheionai struck back! The Eltikhan were vanquished, destroyed!” Eledas turned back to the other bodies – there were only a few left. “And so we have avenged the massacre of our own people! Our kin! Blood has been repaid with blood!”\n\nEledas took a barbhen woman’s corpse, this time. She’d been run through the back with a spear. “But the challenge is not over! The war is not over!” Not over indeed. Eledas and the other soldiers were moving on, soon, to join up with the rest of the army and conquer the heart of the Mteibhar. “Today, you are cleaning up the past – tomorrow, you shall march for the future!” Eledas kicked the corpse into the pit, then wiped the sweat off his brow, before grabbing a shovel. “Only when the enemy is crushed,” the philosopher called, “when the threat they pose is extinguished, may we live free! May our vengeance turn to justice!” The soldier shook his head as the last bodies were thrown into the mass grave. Justice for us, Eledas thought, as he began shoveling dirt into the pit, and death and terror for them."
  deyeion_events.6.a: "Deyeion marches for revenge – and the barbhen fight for their lives."

  deyeion_events.9.t: "A Night of Blood and Fire" #By: Takasaki
  deyeion_events.9.d: "Filinas clutched his spear as he watched beyond the barricades in disbelief. There must have been thousands of them out there in the night, some riding those big-cats of theirs, others circling on foot. The Mteibhar had been warning them off for months, saying they were on their lands, but today they attacked the colony like a sudden storm, though the town itself had a few hours of forewarning. They’d survived the first attack in the evening, repelling the barbhen at a heavy cost. Could they survive another?\n\nThen a cry of “the barbhen come again!” rang out, and he knew he was about to find out. The Mteibhar turned towards the barricaded entrances to the colony and charged, weapons raised – the earth below shook, as their mages tried to bring down the barricades, and slung huge stones at the Kheionai. Then the soldiers made contact, and then blood and battle and death. Filinas killed two, three, four of the enemy, but still they kept coming. He couldn’t stop though. His wife and children were back in the gymnasium at the town’s center, hiding in the drained baths. How could any of the Kheionai defenders abandon them?\n\n“There’s too many!” came a cry from the barricades. “We have to run!” came one from another. Perhaps this is how? Filinas listened in horror, even as he fought on – the Kheionai were routing – routing! Then a militiaman called “every man for himself!” and that was that. The ranks collapsed, and Filinas soon discovered in horror that he was routing too. The Mteibhar broke through. The militia fled as a mass, trying to escape down side streets, even as the gymnasium sprouted flames, and the cries of their loved ones pierced the air. Who had set the fire? Filinas thought, as he was cut down by one of the Barbhen – the Mteibhar in anger, or the Kheionai in mercy?\n\nIt didn’t matter – no Mteibhar admitted to the crime, and no Kheionai man, woman or child lived to give an answer. The colony had been razed to the ground – and the Mteibhar were intent on finishing the job."
  deyeion_events.9.a: "The Mteibhar march for Deyeion!"
