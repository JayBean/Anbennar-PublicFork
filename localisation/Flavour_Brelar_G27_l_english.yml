 string_start_title_brelar:0 "The Republic of Brelar"
 string_start_brelar:0 "§OPrimer§!\n\nNorth of the grand castles of Dolindha lies a dreary range of mountains, grey is their stone and barren-seeming their surfaces. Here the Brelynn flows north, in stark contrast to other Ynnic rivers, and here since immemorial has lain the town of §YBrelar§!, or Siva Brel, "The Grey Hill". \n\nTracing its origins further back than any other ynnic civilisation save perhaps the Battlekings of §YMalacnar§!, the nation of Brelar has ever been a republic. In ancient days the leaders of §YOld Brefineis§! were chosen among the wise and elderly to sit in council and lead their people toward a safe future. Though the republic fell under the rule of §YVareynn§! it never fully lost its traditions, and the fierce and enduring soldiers of the grey hills proved invaluable to the rise of the Dolindhan Kingdom and the formation of the §YYnnic Empire§!. \n\nIn a surprising twist of history, the line of the first Emperor was abruptly ended in 761 leaving the Ynnics leaderless and in turmoil. With no legitimate heir of the §Yyen Dolin§! dynasty to be found the Empire soon devolved into squabbles of rulership, until an unlikely candidate was crowned Vitsar: §YDemirad I yen Brelar§!, a Patrician’s son loosely related to the Dolin family via an old political marriage from the days when Brelar and Vareynn were close. The yen Brelar proved a capable dynasty of ruthless administrative ability and zero tolerance for corruption, during the reign of the sons of Demirad from 761 to 840, the Empire’s provinces were redrawn, its roads and harbours well travelled and prosperous, and its functionaries honest and efficient as never seen before or since. Though due to a lack of military campaigning the §YBrelari§! dynasty falls somewhat below the §YDolin§!and §YVyrekynn§! in prominence, having prioritised the flow of life along the river rather than achieving any grand victories. \n\nWhen the Ynnic Empire fell an effort was made by Brelar to gather what people and knowledge they could rescue to the safety of the Grey Hill, hoping to one day bring a return of their knowledge and expertise to the whole of the Great River. Yet after centuries passed with no end to the post-collapse warfare and warlording of petty ynnic lords even the memory of Brelar is fading. It may not be long before the secrets of the Ynnic Empire and perhaps ones even older are extinguished forever, whether by the negligence of time or by the sword of some upstart Lord.\n\n§ORecent History§!In 1444 the Republic of Brelar lies threatened on all sides, hatred of republicanism has grown within ynnic culture since the rise of feudalism and strongest is this hate in §YAmacimst§!, who boast the greatest knights of the Ynn and greedily eye the forges and masonries of their northern neighbour. In central Dolindha a new upstart has claimed the title of Battleking of §YMalacnar§!, and as ancient rivals to the ancestors of Brelar no doubt has ambitions to march his army of heroes to tear asunder the marble gates. Far to the west the armies of Rzenta are regrouping, though their hate of republicanism is not so great as the Dolindhans’ it is unlikely that the Republic would survive the approach of a second §YHeathen Host§!. \n\nHope of course is not lost in Brelar, for the republic has stood a thousand years by the actions and knowledge of its gruff and enduring people and by the Grace of the §YGreat River§! it shall endure yet a millenia more."

 g27_brelari_endurance_desc:0 "In the peaks and the valleys, the air is thin, and the breath grows strong. By clambering up steep ridges and down mossy gullies, the legs and back grow thick. For these traits which the Argan mountains grant us, for unwavering stamina and broad-backed, grey-haired, gruff-toned soldiers, Brelar is famed in Dolindha…"

Thus it has been, and thus by bright forge and by harsh training, we will ensure it remains."

 g27_argan_ironhouses_title:0 "Vers Argan's Ironhouses"
 g27_argan_ironhouses_desc:0 "The Border Mountains are the only true peaks in the Ynn River Valley; here the forests of the north are cloven in twain, separating the fey lands of western Rzenta from the eerie Cursed East. Here is also the largest iron deposit in the river valley, which since ancient times has granted us might to win fearsome battles and inspiration for wondrous craft. For a thousand years, there have been Ironhouses at work, forging ever-diligently in the dales of Brelar, yet since the fall of the Empire their numbers wane, and the number of iron mines also. This must not be allowed to continue; though the cost for us will be great in these days of decay, we must pool the efforts of the republic into reinvigoration, that the Ironhouses may last a thousand years more."

 g27_restart_mills_title:0 "Restart the Mills"
 g27_restart_mills_desc:0 "It is well and good that our mines are in use, and our Ironhouses ringing, yet to further their continued prosperity the iron must be sold in greater quantities. We know, however, that few shall brave to journey here in this dark age, so we shall strike out from here with our own caravans instead, and we shall build palisades and watchtowers to secure the roads along which, in time, others shall follow. For this we need carts, soldiers and boats; for this the Brelynn shall again churn a hundred watermills in Brelar, that the saws of marble and wood, and the bilges of iron, shall grant us the resources we need."

 g27_marbelous_infrastructure_title:0 "Marbelous Infrastructure"
 g27_marbelous_infrastructure_desc:0 "Brelar now prospers as few places have since the fall of the Vitsars. Since idleness does not become those with less weight to carry, it is now the time to construct works. Not so great as of old perhaps, but firm and functional, reinforced in grey Brelari marble, for things built by the Ironfolk with such materials do not wither easily. Roads, aqueducts, dikes, walls and gatehouses the marbleworks of Brelar shall give to the republic and to Dolindha."

 g27_steel_city_title:0 "City of Steel"
 g27_steel_city_desc:0 "The City of Warriors is a place of roosters, each Battleking asked to crow louder than the last, using their iron to forge frills and bright courting feathers - only to be pierced by arrows that plain chainmail would render a joke. To this city we will ship iron, for there is talent here, ancient as none in the Ynn but us Brelari, but most importantly to this city we shall ship our practicality, for the people of Malacnar lived by vain and fleeting self-aggrandizing - now let them know lasting greatness. To the City of Warriors bring the knowledge of the Ironfolk, bring them an unwavering legacy instead of blazes of glory, bring them calm perseverance instead of frantic struggle against futility, by deed and word make the Hot Fire of the Warrior into the Cold Steel of a true Soldier."

Confusing for so remote a place as Brelar to be home to such courtly schemes, fitting for the Imperial city of Arverynn or the fair castles of Amacimst or fallen Amaceped. Perhaps if the Mayor were a talented enough schemer we could find out from where these rumours come? We might even have a lead already…"

 g27_establish_order_title:0 "Establish the Order"
 g27_establish_order_desc:0 "None know for how long, and few know at all, but there was an order keeping watch over the old Empire. Based out of the towns of Brelar, staunch allies to the Dynasty of yen Dolin, and home to the yen Brelar who succeeded them, this was the Order of the Mountain Eye. Mere candles remain of the fiery gaze of red hot iron which served ruthlessly the Vitsar in Vareynn and Arverynn in their passing, but we possess the power to change this. Grant the Order funds, grant them people, spread their gaze across Dolindha as it was over the entire Ynn of old. Reignite this elusive force as we did our forges, and we shall surely see vast benefits."

 g27_growing_meristems_desc:0 "Through the thick hedges of the Lords of the Garden few eyes can see, all the better for people who prefer to be hidden. In this place of whispered deals, fair words and yet fairer sights and smells let us plant a seed of darkness. Better to infiltrate courts and castles than our commoners are our nobles - to Grebniesth we shall bring them, where in beautiful pavilions they shall be taught the ugliest arts. If they wish to strike at Brelar let the Lords of Dolindha be weary of daggers, by the will of the River they shall fear their own kin."

 g27_dolindha_kneels_desc:0 "Ousted is the haughty Battleking from his proud city. Enlightened is the Amethyst Order. Restored is the Eternal Castle. Reinforced are the foundations of the Floating City, and fearful are the enemies of the surging republic in Rzenta, Sarda and the Homeland alike. All hail [Root.Monarch.GetName] Mayor to all Dolindha!"

 g27_sway_vareynn_title:0 "Sway Vareynn"
 g27_sway_vareynn_desc:0 "Vareynn were once Emperor to all the Ynnics, though in this era they appear to have forgotten this fact; they scrape on their hands in front of the paranoid and unthinking lords of the Eastern Castle as a terrier before its master. But there is pride in this people yet, and should we bring out their pride they will not defend their arrogant purple-cloaked overlords. For no doubt the Amethyst Lord will never stoop so low as to ask for help from his oathkeeper; aid shall be demanded as a baron ordering a peasant, and the descendants of Komerjon shan't bow to demands."

 g27_strike_amacimst_title:0 "Strike at Amacimst"
 g27_strike_amacimst_desc:0 "Strong is the will of the Eastern Castle, bold are its people, yet the fear of the unknown plagues them to such a degree that they would sooner let their people fall to Cursed-One raids than adopt new tactics or weapons. And sooner will they see their castle razed than see a peasant wielding a sword. This is a detriment to Dolindha, and as such it is the will of the Republic to eliminate these reactionary elements, that the borders of the cursed forest remain protected. We shall oust the fearful cowards in charge of the Amethyst order and invite their banished knights home. The new Amethyst order will defend Dolindha from real enemies, not ones made up by old and paranoid Lords."

 g27_eternal_castle_title:0 "The Eternal Castle"
 g27_eternal_castle_desc:0 "The Eternal Castle is ancient by ynnic standards - not so old as Brelar of course, but certainly noteworthy. Once it was grand, with tall domed towers, stout bridges and gold-stained windows. Its people clad themselves in garments in all colours of the rainbow, for such were the days of the Vitsars. No more is it so; the streets of Vareynn are home to ghosts, the people have long moved into farms and castles and left the old palaces to rot by rain and wind in the mournful moonlight once bright across the tall walls... \n\nSo come Brelari, bring to Vareynn new life in stone and marble, it is time for towers to be restored, bridges renewed and windows refitted, it is time for us to bring the renewal birthed in Brelar to our allies in the Eternal Castle."

 g27_boats_rivers_title:0 "Boats and Rivers"
 g27_boats_rivers_desc:0 "The Theocracy of Bosancovac is a recent development, the end of a brief political struggle with the local Patricians where the clergy of the floating city ousted the mayors to the shores and claimed hegemony over the wealth of the reservoir. The Boats, as the Patrician faction was called, are now tasked with funding projects for the Rivers, the clerical faction, even ones so humiliating as the celebration of their own fall. To support the return of Bosancovac to a republic is only natural, especially since the Rivers certainly haven't dealt with any of the social issues the Boats were accused of causing. Corruption festers in their upper classes and threatens to spread beyond their borders; it must be rectified, and fast."

 g27_reservoir_title:0 "The Reservoir"
 g27_reservoir_desc:0 "The Reservoir of Bosancovac is a centre of regional trade. Here the Rogavynn merges into the Ancovynn and the Great River, bringing wealth from all eastern Dolindha. Upon this reservoir lies the somewhat dilapidated floating city; neglect from corruption wears at its foundations and slums on rafts tread water around its edges. The new Bosancovaco republic is aided by Brelar, and the Order of the Mountain Eye will show no tolerance for swindling or negligence in its rule, resources from our rich mountains will be used to reinforce the Dam and the City, and the Reservoir shall see prosperity as never before."

 g27_argan_bulwark_title:0 "Vers Argan Bulwark"
 g27_argan_bulwark_desc:0 ""A summary of collected reports over a decade strengthened in Mayor Kravendil Saskjaro's head the idea that the raids of Cursed Ones and those committed by Rzentur tribes were a matter requiring more effort than the Patricians currently gave it. After the Brelari method, a commission was set to ponder this issue, leading to the proposal of new fortifications along the borders of Vers Argan, as well as mandated oversight and funding on the part of the Nobility. This reform proved initially unpopular due to its expensive nature, with Patricians and Commoners alike frowning upon such responsibility being entrusted to the Nobility, who were little trusted to uphold the ideals of the republic. However, in time a reduction in raids was clearly felt among the people of Brelar and thus the Argan Bulwark is counted among the many solid policies adopted under Saskjaro's period as Mayor." \n\n- Excerpt from "The people of Hrilar" by Erendej yod Hrilynn, 1841"

 g27_second_bulwark_title:0 "A Second Bulwark"
 g27_second_bulwark_desc:0 "Just as the people of Brelar are beset by Cursed One raids, so are the people of Amacimst to our east. Moreso than us even, for their lords favour jousts and plays to patrols and bricklaying, leading to regular major incursions across their border despite the supposed vigilance of the Amethyst Order. To aid the farmers is a task laid before us, and having protected the Argan mountains no doubt we can fortify the plains. The building of forts shall at least prove easier than hauling marble up the mountainsides, and perhaps it may even sow some loyalty in our eastern kin."

 g27_mountain_home_title:0 "Our Mountain Home"
 g27_mountain_home_desc:0 ""Any walk along the moors (which I recommend to visitors, for their dreary beauty may not be found anywhere in the Dominion west of the Ekyunimoy) will reveal jutting shapes of stone at the heads of hills and next to crossings in the paths. These are remnants of forts by which the Republic held at bay both the knights of Amacimst to their east and the hosts of the Gospodh to their west. The sheer quantity would surprise anyone who did not understand the spirit of Hrilar, but even more would people be surprised by the dating of these forts. The oldest may be counted as hillforts built in the days of Stantirvare, and ancient Malacnar, yet the newest be counted but decades before their fall to the Gospodh, and the architecture clearly evolves yet is based on the same original principle; thus, many argue the nation pursued a continuous fortification program over the course of almost two thousand years. Their full number is not known as of yet, but the documents of the Council in the year 1792, during the height of Havoral, state that a survey on defence concluded the fortification complex was such that each citizen of the Republic may easily be fitted into a well-resourced and sturdy fort should bombardment or assault on Brelar commence." \n\n- Excerpt from "The people of Hrilar" by Erendej yod Hrilynn, 1841"

 g27_folk_west_title:0 "Folk of the West"
 g27_folk_west_desc:0 "In likeness to the Dolindhans, the Rzentur also harbour distrust toward the governance of republics. For this reason, it would be folly to do the same as we did in Dolindha and aim to subjugate the rzentan lords. There exists however, a place in which kinship and understanding between the Ynn and the followers of the Dragon has been fostered, thus to the people of Lisicalrevo we shall give our trust, and task this gifted people with the efforts of spreading representative rule to the west."

 g27_into_rzenta_desc:0 "Bold are the warriors of Juzondezan, hardy the miners of Gomosengha, illustrious are the artisans of Pomvasonn, and wise the priests of Svemel. Let us unite these rzentan peoples officially under one government, and grant to our friends in Lisicalrevo a new responsibility; where once they conquered, they now must learn to rule."

 g27_rzentan_parliament_title:0 "The Rzentan Parliament"
 g27_rzentan_parliament_desc:0 "A proposal has been brought before the Mayor by the leadership in Lisicalrevo. It is not well, they say, that Rzenta be ruled by a Dolindhan council in a Dolindhan province. No matter the devotion of our Rzentan sister republic to their god Varlengeilt, resentment among their people still festers. Thus they wish to form a majority-rzentur parliament, based in the holy city of Svemel, Fisvare in our tongue. While there is great merit in this, there is also one very concerning obstacle, for can we guarantee the safety of a parliament located in the very lair of the Dragon?"

 g27_western_forest_title:0 "The Western Forest"
 g27_western_forest_desc:0 "Rzenta, unlike Dolindha, is largely unsettled. Vast tracks of fertile and verdant forest lie north of the fortresses in Gozhar Urthid and Gomosengha, populated by the Old Rzentur, the people who remained in the woods instead of settling in what at the time was Upper Dolindha, and swearing fealty to the Vitsar. It is now time to settle these lands, to bring to them security from the fey and wendigo who prowl the forest. Once more we turn to the Rzentan Parliament, for another task we are to place ahead of them."

 g27_new_mines_forges_title:0 "New Mines and Forges"
 g27_new_mines_forges_desc:0 "Rare in the Ynn River Valley are minerals; iron comes from Malacnar, Brelar, and Gomosengha only, in quantities too meagre to sustain the extended ambition of the two republics. The Ekyunimoy presents another step in alleviating this lack, for here we may establish new operations on a large and wondrous scale. Come ye, sharp prospectors of the Ironfolk, we have new veins to open."

 g27_collaborative_training_title:0 "Collaborative Training"
 g27_collaborative_training_desc:0 "The pike is a favoured weapon of both the Rzentur and the Brelari for the same reason, for when facing the might of ynnic knights there is no more useful tactic than digging in your feet with comrades at your side and letting the foolish lords crash into the wall of steel in their hubris. Now the Brelari and Rzentur are comrades, their similar experiences we shall merge into one martial tradition and one military philosophy, for the security of both peoples’ future."

 g27_votes_rzentur_desc:0 "Brethren of the north are Dolindhan, Rzentur, and Brelari. These three peoples have lifted themselves from oppression under feudal tyrants to peace and prosperity, governed not by the whims of fat old lords but by their own elected representatives. The time has come for their unification into one system. Let not the word of Rzentur be weighted less than the word of Brelari settler or Dolindhan towns-elf; for the enlightenment and the efficient administration of Breluslad the votes of the western people, and all other present and future members of the North Ynnic Confluence shall be merged with the main Parliament. Let all have their voices heard in the Halls of the Hills’ Confluence!"

 g27_secure_dams_title:0 "Secure the Dams"
 g27_secure_dams_desc:0 "Greedily do the lords of Sarda look upon us from the south. In its declaration of the full pursuit of republicanism, Brelar has lost much of its legitimacy, and few would oppose the conquest of Dolindha by foreign powers to replace our rule, however fair we try to make it. Whispers are brought to the Mayor by the Order of the Mountain Eye, ambitions and plots to cross the Ynn, worrying threats of invasion. Already at the crossings are the Brelari Dam Architects, let us to the dams bring also our fortification experts. Let us raise tower and wall, gate and turret, that not even the Alliance of Knightly Lords could penetrate our defences."

 g27_brelar_watermill_desc:0 ""Oh the Vitsars of old laid stone in the Ynn \nto carry elves across its breadth. \nAnd gates in the stone did they carve in turn \nthat ship still may pass down its length. \nSuch gates of stone no arm could budge, nor chained beast e’en wield, \nBut to the force of the waters flowing ever down even mountains’ child must yield" \n\n- Verse from "The Founding of the Great Dams" depicting the religious significance of the use of waterwheels to peoples of the Ynnic faith. An ambition of Brelar has long been to renovate the ancient Brefineis watermill around which the town once was birthed. With safety restored to Dolindha and the Great Dams well studied, now is the time to commence this long-awaited project."

 g27_guild_architects_title:0 "The Guild of Architects"
 g27_guild_architects_desc:0 "The Brelari Dam Architects have been under the ordinance of the state since their founding, yet now with the increased independence felt by our people it has become their wish to separate themselves and create their own entity. While such a direction would make the hiring of their services more expensive and reduce the state’s oversight of the maintenance of the Great Dams, it is the natural result of the policies of the state, and thus the Architects have our support."

 g27_rivers_power_title:0 "The River's Power"
 g27_rivers_power_desc:0 "Most elves assume that when the songs tell of the Ynn moving mountains they are being dramatic, and so did the people of Breluslad once think too. Yet the Guild of Dam Architects claims differently; water, they say, specifically moving water, possesses immense power. Today the Dams power small water pumps, lumbermills, and forge bellows. Soon they shall drain the swamps of Mocvare, saw through even the ancient trees of the Drevonsred, or heat every forge in Malacnar and Brelar itself."

It is not enough that people in Dolindha are granted emancipation by their freedom of movement, by right it should be a right of all the peoples of the world, yet by practicality no such feat is open to us. Let that not dull the grandiosity of the feat we do intend to pursue. People of the North Confluence, descendants of Brefineis, of Rzen, of Lukaus, and of Cannor, be free to cross Aelantir at a whim, rejoice, for from Fröndvagr by the Lament Ocean to Brelmor at the Gates of Eordand pass the ferries of the Grand Riverways!"

 g27_grant_representation_desc:0 "To the people of Brelar the voices of the common elf being heard even in the highest circle has been natural since the infancy of our culture; this is not so for the people of our Iosahar. To the Dolindhan peasant we may not be able to bring the same level of representation as is present in Brelar, nor would such be rational, as few would know to wield such influence, but gradually we will spread rights, knowledge and power across Dolindha, though we will need the practical means to implement such systems first."

Slowly will we spread the values of the republic to even the most remote village, and bring together the people to forge a bright future together as one. Waned has the influence of the reactionaries and traitor lords, by the advance of practical Brelari  generosity and support of the people they swore we oppressed.

From the South and East the history of the Dolindhans, the pride of the descendants of Lukaus, and the songs of the Vitsars and the Great River. From the North descends the history of the Brefineis, weary yet tough, triumphant over the forces of tyranny that sought to end the fires of republicanism at the roots of the mountain.

Yet in Brelar the stores of marble are stacked high, defiant to the trend, but also foolishly preventing its end.

 g27_tradition_anew_desc:0 "We hear tales from the colonies, both worrying and in some ways reassuring. Beyond the reach of the administration, the settlers have begun, or rather re-adopted, the hosting of local small-scale elections, where village representatives are chosen and lead the local administration for a few years until the next election date. While technically a disruption of the republic’s authority, such elections are a known tradition of our Brefineis ancestors. And since the settlers are largely beyond our aid, it is only sensible they are governed by those who can aid them."

 g27_brefineis_rebirth_desc:0 "As a result of the Village Elections hosted by our settlers many of the Brelari people began clamoring for the same to occur within the inner lands of the republic. Especially in Brelar and Vers Argan the sentiment that the settlers had more representation in their governance was cause for upheaval. Systems similar to those in the colonies were implemented, though more integrated into the Republic’s administration. The partaking in these elections was not so great as among the settlers, as few Dolindhans outside Brelar cared much for such things. This culture of elections became seen as a final sign among the people that Brelar had drifted from Dolindhan culture, and in their new ambitions, combined with old tradition, had forged something entirely new."

"Can you see the whole village here lad? We’re doing what they did last year in the village over, we’re gonna decide who makes decisions here ourselves, choose our own leaders like our great great great great grandfathers did in the old days, and not have some blokes over in the towns decide what we can and can’t do out here.

You’ll need to be big and clever and responsible for that day, ok?" \n\nEven standing on the roughly paved square and clasping the hands of the townspeople as their new mayor, Ardjon’s mind goes back to that day - he hopes he will make his village a fair and easy place to live in, he hopes he can make his father’s spirit proud."

 flavour_brelar.150.a:0 "As long as they are no trouble, let them stay."

 flavour_brelar.151.t:0 "Ravelian Society Spreads in Brelar"
 flavour_brelar.151.d:0 "The Ravelian society has been gathering members to it in [Root.GetName]. Their charitable ways and genuine curiosity regarding the crafts of our people have enticed many locals to join their group. Given that the Ravelians tend to prove themselves as solid educators and thinkers, it is good to see their number growing."
 flavour_brelar.151.a:0 "Welcome to [Root.GetName]"

 flavour_brelar.152.t:0 "Ravelians aid with founding a University"
 flavour_brelar.152.d:0 "Ever eager to facilitate the pursuit of knowledge, the Ravelian Society has been working with local Brelari educators and architects in [Root.GetName]. Their aim is the establishment of a Krahrnorian-style university in the province. They will of course need additional funding and expertise to make this happen, but for the sake of furthering the innovativeness of the Brelari people, we can surely find some resources."
 flavour_brelar.152.a:0 "Time to build some lecture-halls."

 flavour_brelar.153.t:0 "Ravelians help set up a Manufactury"
 flavour_brelar.153.d:0 "One interest of the Ravelian Society is the science of artificery, specifically how this art may be used to improve the lives of the average elf and krahrnorian. Thus the Brelari Ravelians have proposed for the state to construct a manufactory in [Root.GetName]. Using these vaunted artificer techniques, they claim it will be a more efficient project, that will prove a direct and noticeable improvement to the lives of the locals."
 flavour_brelar.153.a:0 "A worthy investment, go ahead."

 flavour_brelar.154.t:0 "Ravelian thought gains popularity among Brelari"
 flavour_brelar.154.d:0 "A core thought of the Ravelian society is the emancipation of magic for the use of the common person. As they tell it, Cannor is largely under the yoke of magical and feudal hierarchy, and magic is the main method by which the elite may control the populace. While the Ynn has fewer ties to magic in their nobility than is apparently the case in Cannor, this disillusionment with the hierarchy and its monopolising of power finds much sympathy among Brelari, as the common feeling toward the feudal hierarchies of the Ynn matches the frustration of the Ravelians quite well. Because of this sympathy and mutual understanding, many Brelari in [Root.GetName] have joined the society."
 flavour_brelar.154.a:0 "May we be united in our freedoms"

 flavour_brelar.155.t:0 "Settlers influenced by Ravelians"
 flavour_brelar.155.d:0 "The settlers in the broken sea and the forest of the Cursed Ones have some dissimilarity to the Brelari in Dolindha, as their more rural and cold living conditions as well as their distance to the Great River make the world feel rather different than it does to a resident of Brelar or the argan mountains. Perhaps due to this lack of connection to the Ynn the settlers are quite eager to accept the arrivals of the Ravelian Society and provide them with residency and support. Of course, it may also be a matter of pragmatism, as the Ravelians are a rather charitable bunch and tend to give back to communities that support them, but either way, it seems the people of [Root.GetName] have set up a new branch of the Society in the province."
 flavour_brelar.155.a:0 "Rather more harsh than your cozy coffee houses in cannor, no?"

 flavour_brelar.156.t:0 "The Confluence and Ravelianism"
 flavour_brelar.156.d:0 "The formation of the Ravelian Faith has had much impact on the Ravelian Societies in Breluslad. Many Brelari have converted to the new religion; however, many are also concerned about the new hierarchical structure the Faith now presents, so different to the freedom-seeking intellectualism the societies once followed. The matter of adopting the Ravelian faith on a state level has been brewing among the Councilmen of Breluslad, especially those in areas with large numbers of Ravelian converts. Now people are clamouring for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to make a statement on the matter."
 flavour_brelar.156.a:0 "It can be put to a vote like any other policy."
 flavour_brelar.156.b:0 "The Ravelian faith may be practiced, but Breluslad shall not convert to it."

 flavour_brelar.50.t:0 "An Heir Announced"
 flavour_brelar.50.d:0 "Over the past few centuries, the influence of ynnic feudalism has steadily been sowing its seeds in Brelar. Especially during the current dark ages the distrust and decentralisation of Dolindha has caused an increase in feudal thinking among Brelari. This is most evidently present in how our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is no longer elected by village elders locally elected in turn but by families of wealthy patricians, usually among their own number. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has gone a step too far, however, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has declared that upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death his son ought to be elected as his successor, openly [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has called for the patricians to support him as if his succession were that of a hereditary lordship and not a Republic."
 flavour_brelar.50.a:0 "This is treason, exile the [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan]"
 flavour_brelar.50.b:0 "Well as long as the heir stands for election..."

 flavour_brelar.51.t:0 "Brewing Betrayal"
 flavour_brelar.51.d:0 "There is turmoil in the lands of our overlord and the time has come for us to pick a side in the mess. Will we support the establishment of a Brelari lordship? Or will we support the defence of the ancient republic in the hills?"
 flavour_brelar.51.a:0 "Monarchist faction"
 flavour_brelar.51.b:0 "Loyalist faction"

 flavour_brelar.53.t:0 "Cracks in the Mortar"
 flavour_brelar.53.d:0 "Long have we believed Brelar to be safe from falling into feudalism and serfdom, as has almost all the rest of the Ynn. A hope bred by hubris and mortared by complacency. Today the Order of the Mountain Eye brings to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] reports of collusion among our Iosahar. War is on the horizon as the armies of our subjects march upon Brelar, claiming righteousness in the betrayal of their sacred oaths citing the installation of a Lord as justification for their sacrilege. Now is the time for all the people of the republic to stand up, to defend to the death the ideals of ancient Brefineis, that the embers of republicanism shall not be eternally wiped out."
 flavour_brelar.53.a:0 "Let the fools come, greater foes have fallen to our pikes"
 flavour_brelar.53.b:0 "This is not a war we can fight"

 flavour_brelar.54.t:0 "The Dam Bursts"
 flavour_brelar.54.d:0 "Unsuspected by even our spies, the armies of our Iosahar have been mustering. Now suddenly the swords of our oathkeepers are turned against us. Purposefully do they march toward Brelar, intent on proclaiming a lord of all Dolindha, intent on the destruction of our ancient republic."
 flavour_brelar.54.a:0 "Should've seen this coming, so be it"
 flavour_brelar.54.b:0 "We cannot stand against this"

 flavour_brelar.55.t:0 "An Inevitable Bifurcation"
 flavour_brelar.55.d:0 "It has ever been a push and pull, ebb and flow between the ideals we hold from old Brefineis and those of Dolindha and the Ynnic. No longer may we live under the foolish belief that we may subjugate and unite the Ynn using its institutions whilst actively following ones so foreign to theirs, yet still we cannot relinquish our ideals and traditions. Thus what is in front of us is a choice: Do we compromise with the ideals of the Ynn, and forge a new system by which we may unite the Empire? Or do we stand for no restriction to our republic, and forsake ynnic unification to forge our own harsh destiny?"
 flavour_brelar.55.a:0 "We shall compromise that we may unite the Ynn"
 flavour_brelar.55.b:0 "We will never sacrifice our ancient ways"

 flavour_brelar.56.t:0 "The Fall of the Ironfolk"
 flavour_brelar.56.d:0 "Screams almost drown out the incessant churning of the hundreds of waterwheels as the armies of monarchism enter the ancient town of Brelar. Soon burned are the council halls of old and soon slain every elf who dared resist or protest. The banner of the golden waterwheel is cut from every pole where it flies and tramped into the marble pavements as the collapse of the Brelari Republic is made complete. And as the sun sets and the slaughter subsides, for the first time in a millennium do the watermills fall entirely silent. They will start anew tomorrow, no doubt, but without the pride and rule of old brefineis will their churn ever ring the same?"
 flavour_brelar.56.a:0 "Will their hum ever be the same?"

 flavour_brelar.57.t:0 "Promises of Peace"
 flavour_brelar.57.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] rises to the carved steps above the paved marble square overlooking the falling river. No podium nor throne, crown nor sceptre does the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wield for power as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice to address the summoned crowd. Within a clearly defined set of years [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] declares, the resurging state of Brelar shall undo vast amounts of damage dealt by the Ynnic Dark Ages. To prove the legitimacy of the Republic Brelar shall not posture or fight wars but provide and administer. We shall re-urbanise the cities and bring prosperity to all Dolindha in this time, for if we show we are more capable of bringing peace and wealth to Dolindha than the Lords and their serfdom, surely the people will come to accept our rule."
 flavour_brelar.57.a:0 "Will we make it in time?"
 flavour_brelar.57.b:0 "Let us compromise between speed and safety"
 flavour_brelar.57.c:0 "The Dark Ages have been around for centuries, people can wait"

 flavour_brelar.60.t:0 "Promises Broken"
 flavour_brelar.60.d:0 "Two decades ago the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proclaimed Brelar would defeat the decay of the Dark Ages and bring prosperity to all Dolindha. Now is the year [GetYear] and no such thing has come to pass. What efforts the republic have presented are lost to the ears of the people and the nobility, for the vows made to them proved to be empty words."
 flavour_brelar.60.a:0 "We were fools to speak so boldly"

 flavour_brelar.58.t:0 "Separatists in the Republic"
 flavour_brelar.58.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetName] are disgruntled with the rule of the republic. They yearn to return to being under the whims of a careless ynnic lord and have taken arms against us in hopes of seceding."
 flavour_brelar.58.a:0 "Call Our Banners!"
 flavour_brelar.58.b:0 "Maybe we can negotiate with them?"

 flavour_brelar.59.t:0 "Reactionaries in the Republic"
 flavour_brelar.59.d:0 "The roots of monarchism are not eroded instantly. Especially among the nobles, there are many who consider our divorce from Ynnic feudalism to be a step in the wrong direction. The Nobles in [Root.GetName] have for this reason risen in defiance, and they demand the republic revert what they feel are policies infringing on their rights."
 flavour_brelar.59.a:0 "So you have chosen death."
 flavour_brelar.59.b:0 "We can give a little."

 flavour_brelar.31.t:0 "A Decrease in Rarity"
 flavour_brelar.31.d:0 "Iron was once produced only in Malacnar, Gomosengha, and most notably in Brelar. Now more places in the Ynn River Valley serve as sources for the good, and the rigorous infrastructure by which we could keep up with demand for the good is no longer necessary. It is time for Vers Argan to be allowed to grow as a city and as a province, to not be held to be naught but a mine. Of course even with this change the great mines of the Border Mountains remain by far the largest and most productive in the entire valley."

 flavour_brelar.700.t:0 "Election!"
 flavour_brelar.700.desc:0 "The passing of the previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] necessitates a new Leader of the Dynastic Republic. Ere the new reign of a new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] may commence one must be elected from the valid candidates among the Nobles and Patricians of [Root.GetName]. Through several counts the succeeding heir seemed unclear, yet at the end of the grueling process one name stands clear as the winner."
