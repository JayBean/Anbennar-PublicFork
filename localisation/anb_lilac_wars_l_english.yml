 lilac_wars.10.t:0 "Woe to the Vanquished"
 lilac_wars.10.d:0 "The wind is heavy with whispers, none of them too kind. Quiet words of blame, anger, and disappointment swirl in our court. Being on the losing end of the recent warring has left many notables in difficult positions. Old allegiances are being tested as different parties struggle to pick up the pieces after having waxed or waned.. Otherwise petty issues are being inflamed by the general malaise felt. It will be some time till we can say these days are behind us."
 lilac_wars.10.a:0 "Woe indeed"
 lilac_wars.11.t:0 "The Price of Victory"
 lilac_wars.11.d:0 "The Lilac Wars were kind to the Rose. Even if we weren’t able to secure huge tracts of lands, various dispensations have resulted in our court receiving many newcomers who now fall under our jurisdiction thanks to the various treaties that ended the war. They range from priests formerly sovereign abbeys and temples recently brought under our control to minor barons paying homage due to the transfers of exclaves and other minor lands. Such pomp and circumstance is helpful in securing for ourselves what we must of this newfound peace. We flowered with the Rose and we shine that bit brighter for it across the land."
 lilac_wars.11.a:0 "An end and a victory."
 lilac_wars.21.t:0 "Soldiers Turn to Banditry"
 lilac_wars.21.d:0 "Many soldiers went to fight for the Moon and Rose and many of those who returned were sent home, as levies were disbanded and mercenary groups split apart with much stiffened demand. Some of those who left only ever picked up the sword to avoid the till and have no desire to return to the fields. Increasing reports of banditry in the wake of the war’s end have come to the attention of the capital. They plague one of our districts in particular and while they are no threat to our order they have the people there more agitated than usual and less receptive to our government."
 lilac_wars.21.a:0 "We need to do our best to restore control, at any cost."
 lilac_wars.22.t:0 "A Quiet Place"
 lilac_wars.22.d:0 "The Wars of the Lilac were not always felt in the crash of steel or the slinging of magicks. Sometimes they were felt by those at court realising that their family no longer responded to letters they should. Other times it was felt by the courtiers who returned home to find their fetes and festivals had fallen by the wayside. And, at times there was no one even left to feel it. A desolate village, soon to become the home of bandits for bands of soldiers to chase off.  It was the unquiet of war, felt in court as much as in the provinces. Even the most  hopeful know that it will some time till sound returns to these places left behind."
 lilac_wars.22.a:0 "This silence will last a while."
 lilac_wars.23.t:0 "The Fallow Fields"
 lilac_wars.23.d:0 "Across Cannor, starvation is ripe and its harvest has come due. Crop failures and a dearth of workers, consequences of the recent Lilac Wars, have left us unable to fully feed our people. Some will go hungry, others will die. Insulated at court as we are in our ability to keep ourselves fed; we will still see the toll. Both in terms of those lost we may have known and also in the lack of productivity as crops are left unharvested. Even those who survive will be weaker for it. Across our land hunger will be felt for some time across high and low."

 lilac_wars.25.t:0 "Furnace of War"
 lilac_wars.25.d:0 "It is good that war is terrible, that we do not grow too fond of it. Yet not all of war is so terrible. The desperation and urgency of the Lilac Wars afforded us greater powers than we would’ve otherwise not had as the realm grappled with crisis. Gone are old dues and laws written with a different Cannor in mind, whose sole purpose was to empower the obstinate.The realm is better administered than ever before and we look to take our next steps."
 lilac_wars.25.a:0 "We need to take advantage of these reins while we can."
 lilac_wars.30.t:0 "Disputes Over the Scraps"
 lilac_wars.30.d:0 "We have won the Lilac Wars and no one can deny that the Siloriel are secure as the greatest of the Silver Families. It is our time of victory yet the nature of our kingdom ensures that whenever we incorporate lands into our realm that there are always those picking over the scraps. Be they merchants seeking their tolls, clerics their abbeys and nobles additional lands, all are quick to voice who should hold the land in trust for their regal lord, King Kylian. My liege will have to put up with quite a few meetings from such parties for the next few years as we digest our success in such proceedings."
 lilac_wars.30.a:0 "Let’s get started then."
 lilac_wars.31.t:0 "To Serve Man and Rule Over Him"
 lilac_wars.31.d:0 "We have done it, your Imperial Majesty. We have triumphed alongside our allies and now is a time for a more Alenic character to the Dove Throne. Our people celebrate our triumph and even in our new conquests the prestige of your rule brings us some peace in integrating such lands. The Wexonards of old and the new Wexonards of Dameria together know that this is the beginning of the new era for the sil Wex and our realm with it. Magicians inspired by Lothane are leading glamorous celebrations and the people know that even as we have newfound enemies, that a moment of triumph like this deserves to be remembered."
 lilac_wars.31.a:0 "Let all take in our magnificence!"
 lilac_wars.32.t:0 "The Innocence of Duke Laurens"
 lilac_wars.32.d:0 "The education of Marquis Laurens has been progressing well and we dare to hope he will live up to the name Silmunas. However, a recent, if minor, incident has left many uneasy. \n\nIn one of our sessions with him about the history of the Silmunas, the young man asked with typical childish innocence about if he’d ever get the chance to meet Uncle Rogier. The tutor panicked and said that if the Marquis so wished, it would be best to protect the wish by keeping it secret and safe. Laurens is a young boy and given our role in the Lilac Wars his innocence often pangs Wesdamerians of status with guilt over what was done. None however have seen it fit to quit and instead take more wages for themselves to cope."
 lilac_wars.32.a:0 "We shall have to work around this."
 lilac_wars.33.t:0 "Truly Tragic Opportunity"
 lilac_wars.33.d:0 "The Lilac Wars are over. Dameria has fallen.  In the wake of this bitter defeat, the false Emperor Lothane sits upon the throne, usurped with the aid of the Lorentish. All is not lost, though. Despite the loss of our beloved liege lords, we of Istralore have begun to lay the groundwork to ensure that the Empire built by the Silmunas can be safeguarded in true hands like ourselves. Already, our courtiers and diplomats are hard at work, seeking allies, both new and old and laying the groundwork for the Second Silver Family of Anbennar to finish what the first started. The sky remains dark for now, but the new moon will come again. And as it waxes, so too shall Istralori glory!."
 lilac_wars.33.a:0 "It is Istralore’s time."
 lilac_wars.34.t:0 "Night Shrouds the Moon"
 lilac_wars.34.d:0 "Our lands suffer. Though we are only a small power in the Empire, we served the Moon Party as loyally as we could. The reward was stinging defeat. Yet, for all of our woes, our loss was not so devastating as it could have been; Coruvia did not take the chance to try and claim our Dostannorian land. A small respite in this dark time. Indeed, our government has been greatly weakened by the loss of so many of our knights and mages.\n\nWorse still, we continue to receive word at court of disturbing reports. Administrators seem to simply disappear in the night. More and more of the local elites we rule through are barricading themselves at night.  Across the countryside, there is a quiet fear of something afoot. Something seems to be about to give in our humble land"
 lilac_wars.34.a:0 "The night is dark and full of terror."
 lilac_wars.35.t:0 "In Search of Myth and Wings"
 lilac_wars.35.d:0 "In times since the war’s end, many across Verne have begun to wonder if there was  more we could have done. We were defeated in the Lilac Wars but to blame our allies alone when many in Dameria shouldered the blame most would be cowardly. We could have done more, at court and across our nation and so we will now devote ourselves to doing more for Verne itself as we take our new place. In the wyvern we trust. We shall soar to new heights, we shall embody the majesty to build back what was lost with the moon and just as human bonds with rider so shall we find new connections. We shall find the wyvern within just as we hold out hope that the creatures themselves can be found once more."
 lilac_wars.35.a:0 "In these times it is radical to hope."
 lilac_wars.41.t:0 "Ruins of Chivalry"
 lilac_wars.41.d:0 "Across our people, from the Winebay to the lands betwixt the Small Country and the Derannic coast, the nobility has always ruled. They have been at the heart of every realm. And now that heart lies bleeding. From lowly baron to regal duke, every noble family has experienced the catastrophic generational losses of the Lilac Wars. Across the borders of the breakaway states and the older realms, we feel their absence. A core element of how our countries were run is now simply missing. Across our peoples in many localities things have simply fallen apart. The feudal link has faltered leaving the personal element of government broken. It is all our state can do to handle the escheat and find distant heirs to various lands in need of holders."
 lilac_wars.41.a:0 "Across quietened manors and the rudderless villages."
 lilac_wars.42.t:0 "Thorned Moon Boat Festival"
 lilac_wars.42.d:0 "Throughout Esmaria preparations are being made and our court shall not be absent. A great battle shall soon begin, one fought not with steel but with artistry. Yes, the Thorned Moon festival shall soon be upon us. Courtiers and designers, princes and baronesses from both the Moon and Rose parties are gathering now that the war is done. A true testament to Esmari dedication to fashion and beauty that these former foes can talk across the former lines of conflict once more. \n\nIn this contest,  potions, perfumes and songs shall take the flanks. And at the vanguard shall be clothes and dresses of silk and fabric. As for us, we will make sure we have the presence to renew contacts and restore those with whom we fought against. The Lilac Wars were a tragedy but also the vogue of the past. It is well past time to usher in a new trend."
 lilac_wars.42.a:0 "Nothing like a good riverine fete"
 lilac_wars.43.t:0 "What Lies Broken"
 lilac_wars.43.d:0 "The Grand Duchy of Dameria was a nation once whole, uniting us under one banner of culture and purpose. Thus, its destruction was the greatest tragedy of the Lilac Wars. Across Rose or Moon, a great nation has been lost. \n\nBut, we cannot simply mourn. We must now do our best to make a future in this new order. New borders have divided us from our neighbors. Many at the court still mistakenly refer to the old Grand Duke, may he and his family rest well. Indeed, it seems as though it will take some time before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.GetName] settle into this strange reality. "
 lilac_wars.43.a:0 "To Dameria, may the memory live long."
 lilac_wars.44.t:0 "Far from the Fame"
 lilac_wars.44.d:0 "The sea grows more still than it has for a long time. It seems the storm that was the Lilac Wars has finally passed. And with this peace, trade has been enabled to grow once more. New goods flow safely throughout the Dameshead and with it new profits. For those in [Root.GetName], that is more than enough. "
 lilac_wars.44.a:0 "We can fish to our heart’s content once more."
 lilac_wars.45.t:0 "The Old Ways of War"
 lilac_wars.45.d:0 "For we who joined the Empire, the Lilac Wars were largely a success. However, they also  highlighted the ways in which our society’s organisation meant that such warring was both boon and bane. The traditional organisation of our levies meant that our losses were often highly localised. This also means that our survivors tend towards a veteran status at the core of our soldiers. The learning that we are internalising at court from this experience should provide the basis for our decisions as other nations bear the brunt of the wars more heavily than we who hew true. Those lost will be mourned and those who returned will ensure that more come back next and next again."
 lilac_wars.45.a:0 "What was lost will not be for naught."
 lilac_wars.46.t:0 "An End to the Dances of Death"
 lilac_wars.46.d:0 "The Lilac Ballet was one of the greatest dances performed by death since we came to this land. The staggering losses were keenly felt across the Elfreams and at our court. It was grief enough to see so many good men and women fall in defence of what we knew was right. But for the oldest among us, it was nearly too much to see the same devastation as that in the time of the Free Realms. Across [Root.GetName], their wails over the loss of familial friendships spanning generations lost under the ruin of burnt villages cry out In this time of mourning, many have renounced violence entirely in response to these travesties. It will be some time till our army will be able to recruit as they once did."
 lilac_wars.46.a:0 "For all the voices that sing no more."
 lilac_wars.47.t:0 "Spears into Ploughshares"
 lilac_wars.47.d:0 "Those who've returned to the Serpentspine might scoff at us who remain in our new homes, adapting to the end of the Flower-Grudge, but we’ve our own ways. Ways that involve getting back to work and doing our best as craftsmen to find a measure of peace and profit without qualm as we do so. \n\nOf course, we know this peace won’t last. Despite their shorter lifespans, humans are almost half as good at holding grudges as a dwarf. The Flower-Grudge might be over but we’ll be turning ploughshares into spears and back again soon. Luckily, war and peace both make good business."
 lilac_wars.47.a:0 "It’s honest work."
 lilac_wars.48.t:0 "A Broken Basket "
 lilac_wars.48.d:0 "Of all the places that suffered under the fighting during the Lilac Wars few can claim to have suffered worse than the Small Country. Constant chevauchée by Moon party forces during the Second Lilac War nearly destroyed Cannor with a ruinous famine. Meanwhile halflings were reminded once again that the big folk were either unable or unwilling to defend them and their interests. \n\nFor now though, the worst of it has passed and it is once again up to the small folk to pick up the pieces and rebuild Cannor's bread basket. There are many, though, who wish to see a new fate for them and their countrymen. Memories of the Viswall rebellion are still fresh in the mind of many halflings and a fire once lit is not so easily extinguished."
 lilac_wars.48.a:0 "Let us restore the fields and farms."
 lilac_wars.48.b:0 "What we still have will be defended!"
 lilac_wars.51.t:0 "New Beginnings"
 lilac_wars.51.d:0 "It has been some time since the Lilac Wars and their direct effects have been largely forgotten, through new peace and newer wars their memory has dulled. Yet we still recall when we were plagued by soldiers turned bandits in the outlying districts of our realm. It was only through new expansions of our levies and better use of them has resulted in most bandits killed or otherwise driven away. \n\nMost is not all though and the suffering caused has birthed many would-be soldiers and novice adventurers. Among them is a teenager who has arrived in the capital. He has gathered a militia on his own initiative to support the forces we sent to clear bandits out and showed a knack for command as he did so. We have space for him and the only question is how to put him to task?"
 lilac_wars.51.a:0 "He shall have a place as one of our leading officers."
 lilac_wars.51.b:0 "Let him teach others and work with the officers here at court."
 lilac_wars.52.t:0 "A Gift from the Gone"
 lilac_wars.52.d:0 "The Lilac Wars were a devastating affair to many villages and towns. Some even being wiped off the map, their inhabitants scattered or worse. In other cases though, the old buildings were slowly resettled with former refugees and squatters, becoming the new inhabitants of the location in full. \n\nIt is a slow process, one that is almost never easy. But, time has passed since those long years of war upon war and now recovery has given way to the beginnings of prosperity. The young woman petitioning us now is proof of that. They stand before us as someone who benefited from picking up things left behind from those simple starved and withered away when she was forced to strike out on her own in life as a widow. She was able to use funds from selling on and pawning these items to afford a world class education and better her lot in life. Enough so to stand as a fine lady before us.\n\nClearly she is a capable individual to have survived so long with no one else to support her. Perhaps our business with her can extend past her petition?"
 lilac_wars.52.a:0 "Let her help manage her home in line with the petition"
 lilac_wars.52.b:0 "We should give her a permanent place to aid the whole realm"
 lilac_wars.53.t:0 "Sudden Bumper Crop"
 lilac_wars.53.d:0 "Of late we have noticed a new trend in some of the crops we tax. Crops that, since the start of the Lilac Wars, have been a rarity. Yet now yields have begun to surpass pre-war harvests.\n\nSuch a thing was soon the cause of much speculation. Was it an experiment of the Magisterium? A rogue mage? After a short investigation the reason, to the court’s disappointment, would prove more mundane - an enterprising local. \n\nApparently they had simply taken  advantage of the cheap lands to bring more fields under single ownership and increase efficiency. An impressive, if decidedly non-magical, reason to explain the bumper crop. Interestingly, they also mentioned they had become slightly bored with their success and offered their services to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. What should we do?"
 lilac_wars.53.a:0 "Let them aid our construction efforts"

 lilac_wars.55.t:0 "As New Becomes Old"
 lilac_wars.55.d:0 "The Lilac Wars helped our realm more than most when they allowed us to make greater efficiencies based on what was necessary at the time. And yet time heals all wounds. The once absent tape in bureaucracy can be said to be fully restored and we are no longer as efficient as we once were relative to our peers, much to the frustration of the younger members of our court \n\nIndeed just last night one such youth confided in some trusted friends that he didn’t understand the point of some of our tolls and laws on select imports. It was as though they were  for a different time, he complained. A bit too loudly it would seem for as soon as the older guard caught wind of this discussion more than a few laughs were had. What irony that that time had made the new become old, and now these old servants of the realm had become the very thing their youthful selves had opposed. \n\nAs the laughter subsided, the two generations mingled to discuss the tolls and laws in question. In that time stories of the past, and drink, were shared and old memories reminisced."
