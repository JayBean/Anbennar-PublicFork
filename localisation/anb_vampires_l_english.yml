 vampire_ruler.0.t:0 "Vampire Ruler is Revealed"
 vampire_ruler.0.d:0 "For years now our [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ruled the country secretly as a vampire. Whilst there have been rumours about his true identity, it long remained a secret.\n\nBut nothing lasts forever, not even the secrets of a powerful undead. Recently the rumours have been increasing across the land, and it is becoming more and more difficult to deny them. It is only a matter of time now until the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is exposed. If we act quickly we should still be able to preserve the masquerade, as every vampire is duty- and honor-bound to do. But it will require [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s immediate abdication of the throne, a life of obscurity [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] only path forward."
 vampire_ruler.0.a:0 "I must step down."

 vampire_ruler.1.t:0 "Age Draws Suspicion"
 vampire_ruler.1.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has ruled [Root.GetName] for many years now, and some are beginning to question the lack of any visible aging. Their face remains young and hale, not a speck of grey in their hair, and their eyes retain their uncanny allure.\n\nIf [Root.Monarch.GetName] is to continue ruling then extreme measures should be taken to preverse the secrecy of their identity."
 vampire_ruler.1.a:0 "Fortunately I already have an heir"

 vampire_ruler.2.t:0 "An Inquisitive Advisor"
 vampire_ruler.2.d:0 "One of our advisors has grown curious as of late, what with our ruler's late night excursions and unusual nature, and so took it upon themselves to investigate further.\n\nIf they were simply a peasant with a wandering mind, this would not be troubling, due to the long-standing measures taken to preserve the identity of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. However, likely due to their proximity to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the advisor has pierced this veil, realized [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s true nature and is now threatening to expose them!"
 vampire_ruler.2.a:0 "Nobody will believe them"
 vampire_ruler.2.b:0 "Perhaps I can convince you not to talk"
 vampire_ruler.2.c:0 "Shame, I always did like you"
 
 vampire_ruler.3.t:0 "Wounded During Training"
 vampire_ruler.3.d:0 "It is not unusual for rulers to spar with their generals and other nobles in the realm, and it is extremely rare for serious injuries to occur in such a duel -- but such things do happen.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] suffered such an injury in his duel earlier today. Fortunately, due to their vampiric nature, they were left with no permanent damage, but it has left some rather awkward questions as to how [Root.Monarch.GetName] survived."
 vampire_ruler.3.a:0 "It wasn't that bad..."
 vampire_ruler.3.b:0 "Me? Wounded?"
 
 vampire_ruler.4.t:0 "Invitation to a Banquet"
 vampire_ruler.4.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been invited to visit the court of a great noble family for a fair. Accepting such an invitation would require great effort be taken to avoid drawing attention to our [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s vampiric nature. Not to mention the risk presented by sunlight. While they are under no obligation to attend such an event, it would be seen as a sign of disrespect and certainly draw this family's enmity.\n\nBut should a lion really be concerned with the feelings of sheep?"

 vampire_ruler.4.b:0 "I will have to decline"
 
 vampire_ruler.5.t:0 "Sire's Request"
 vampire_ruler.5.d:0 "As a Vampire Spawn [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the responsibility of their Sire, the vampire who granted [Root.Monarch.GetName] the Blood Gift. As such, by vampiric tradition and custom, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is duty-bound to follow whatever orders [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] recievevs -- regardless of the crown on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head or the throne [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sits atop.\n\nRecently [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Sire has begun making exorbitent demands of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], demanding they are granted privileges above and beyond that of any normal nobility. And today, another such demand arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], deep red ink scratching out an absurd request on bone-white paper. How shall the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proceed?"
 vampire_ruler.5.a:0 "I must oblige"
 vampire_ruler.5.b:0 "They do not command me!"
 
 vampire_ruler.6.t:0 "Overlapping Authority"
 vampire_ruler.6.d:0 "Reports have reached us of a feral Vampire acting within the capital. Though such monsters are not unheard of, vampiric rumours swirling amongst our people shall surely draw unwanted attention to our ruler and other vampires in our country.\n\nAs such, the Vampire estate has demanded the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] lend state assistance in hunting down and destroying this errant predator. The tone of these requests began politely, but have recently escalated into all-but-commands -- as if they have forgotten just what role [Root.Monarch.GetName] plays within [Root.GetName].\n\nIndeed, this is a traditional responsibility of the Vampire estate. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could intercede, however -- and even overrule them if nessecary."
 vampire_ruler.6.a:0 "My domain, my rules"
 vampire_ruler.6.b:0 "Assist the Vampire estate"
 vampire_ruler.6.c:0 "It is not worth the cost"
 
 vampire_ruler.7.t:0 "Siring an Heir"
 vampire_ruler.7.d:0 "Vampires are heavily restricted from Siring new heirs, as doing so without caution brings great risk to the Masquerade. Any new heirs must be approved by other Vampires in the realm and they must be carefully selected.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has found the perfect candidate for the blood gift, and is ready to brush aside any concerns [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] brethren have. What is the point of being a vampire, or being [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], if you cannot spread its blessing to the worthy? The only question that remains now is how they shall serve."
 vampire_ruler.7.a:0 "They shall succeed me"
 vampire_ruler.7.b:0 "They shall serve me as an advisor"
 vampire_ruler.7.c:0 "They shall lead our armies"
 vampire_ruler.7.e:0 "This would draw attentions"

 vampire_ruler.8.t:0 "Hosting a Grand Masquerade"
 vampire_ruler.8.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has begun contemplating the organization of a grand masquerade, inviting every noble of the realm and even select foreign dignitaries. Wine -- and other liquids -- would flow, there would be feasting aplenty, and the entire court would dance the night away.\n\nSuch an event would certainly improve relations with our neightbours greatly, but it would not be cheap. But the best luxuries never are."
 vampire_ruler.8.a:0 "We will host this Masquerade"
 vampire_ruler.8.b:0 "It is too expensive"
 
 vampire_ruler.10.t:0 "The Gnawing Hunger"
 vampire_ruler.10.d:0 "All vampires know the hunger, a nagging urge always in their mind. It is something no vampires cannot escape from, no matter their power and resolve, and eventually they will be consumed by that urge.\n\nSome nights the hunger is distant and a vampire can almost pretend they do not feel it. Some nights it niggles at the mind, a small itch, but one that cannot quite be scratched. And on nights like tonight? Tonight the hunger consumes [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 vampire_ruler.10.a:0 "I must hunt"
 vampire_ruler.10.b:0 "I will control myself"

 vampire_ruler.11.t:0 "The Beast Inside"
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
 vampire_ruler.11.d:0 "Keeping control is no easy task for a vampire. They all know the pull of the Beast, the monster that lives within every vampire threatening to take them over. And as [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows, one that beast begins to pull, there is only one way to stave it off.\n\nTonight, the yearning has struck our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] course of action seems clear."

 vampire_ruler.11.d:0 "Keeping control is no easy task for a vampire. They all know the pull of the beast, the monster that lives within each one. A monster that constantly threatens to take them over, wrestle control away from the rational being that normally inhabits their earthly shell. And as [Root.Monarch.GetName] well knows, one that beast begins to pull, there is only one way to stave it off.\n\nTonight, the yearning has struck our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] course of action seems clear."

 vampire_ruler.12.t:0 "The Unending Obsession"
 vampire_ruler.12.d:0 "With centuries of unlife ahead of them, many vampires seem to lean into one of their pre-turning obsessions or another. Some pursue knowledge in dusty tomes, some seek power in courtroom or battlefield, still others indulge in every hedonistic pleasure known to man (and invent new ones as well).\n\nBut those are all lies, pay them no heed. The only true obsession a vampire knows, the one that will last them as long as they unlive, is blood. And today, that is feeling particularly true for [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 vampire_ruler.13.t:0 "The Hunt Begins"
 vampire_ruler.13.d:0 "It is well known that vampires hunt, going out on nightly incursions to fill themselves on the blood of prey. Less well known is the fact there is more to hunting than simple nourishment -- a good part of the reason vampires hunt is for the thrill of the chase itself.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] feels the stirring of both desires in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] loins tonight. With all the necessary preparations complete the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] departs the seat of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power, searching for the victim who will be their prey tonight."

 vampire_ruler.14.t:0 "The Hunt - A Feral Vampire"
 vampire_ruler.14.d:0 "Recent rumours have cought [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s attention tonight: a lurker in the shadows of [Root.Capital.GetName], preying on its populace late at night and leaving nothing but empty corposes behind. This is undoubtedly not the fault of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who treats satiation with much more care and respect -- it must be a feral vampire.\n\nAnd so, amidst darkened streets only lit by moon-sliver, [Root.Monarch.GetName] begins to hunt the would-be hunter. From shadows, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] watches the shadows; from roof-tops, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] watches the rooftops; with a predator's eye, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] considers what another predator might focus on.\n\nAnd then -- movement where there should not be. A rival? No. A victim, of circumstance -- and soon of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s blade."
 vampire_ruler.14.a:0 "They cannot be left alive"
 vampire_ruler.14.b:0 "I should desist"
 
 vampire_ruler.15.t:0 "The Hunt - A Vampire Hunter"
 vampire_ruler.15.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] left their seat of power to hunt, but as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stalked the streets, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had a disquieting feeling: that of being stalked in turn. And now, at the sight of a cloaked man also roaming [Root.Capital.GetName]'s streets, whose steel-tipped wooden stakes glint in the moonlight, it is clear that someone would turn our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] from predator into prey.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] could attempt an ambush, matching their pursuer head-on, but such a course of action would be risky. No matter what, it is clear tonight's feeding must be done with care, or perhaps abandoned entirely... but it cannot wait for long."
 vampire_ruler.15.a:0 "You die here and now fiend!"

With the picture minted on every [Root.GetAdjective] coin a constant reminder, even the humblest peasant is expected to be able to recognize the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Normally this is a privilege of the rank -- but tonight, it has turned sour.\n\nThe hunt was proceeding apace, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] could almost taste the fresh blood that seemed so close. When, suddenly, the door of one of [Root.Capital.GetName]'s many houses swung open, and the brandished torch within lit up [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face. The door-opener, still in their sleep-wear, gasped and exclaimed "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"\n\nIf not sorted out, this could lead to some awkward rumours, perhaps it would be the one snowflake that triggers an avalanche of suspicion. This is not a risk [Root.Monarch.GetName] can take lightly -- what shall [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] do?"

In Anbenncost, it signals a vast flood of people to rise from cramped quarters and make their way to just-as-cramped workhouses. In Gerudia, it demands a dozen skalds sing again the song of the Dragon and the Skald, to ensure solar warmth is never drowned out by draconic ice.\n\nBut for [Root.Monarch.GetName], it is a frustrating sight -- the marker of a fruitless, bloodless, night.

 vampire_ruler.19.d:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] lay in darkness, and it was a darkness of three parts.\n\nThe most obvious darkness was that of the comforting shadows of the main square, lurking between areas of torchlight. A darkness constantly pierced by the opening of a tavern door and the outpour of light and music, but all-embracing in the moments in-between. In the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palatial estate, many slept, and those that did not primarily did their work in a darkness of another kind, a darkness foreshadowing the deeds of days and weeks and years to come.\n\nAnd there was a third darkness, not an easy thing to notice. The darkness of [Root.Monarch.GetName], as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] walked the streets confidently, patiently, in obscurity. A darkness that crept and prowled, raced and held granite-still; a darkness well-familiar to the hunting panther or watchful owl.\n\nIn due time, the darkness found one of the inhabitants of [Root.GetCapitalName], and marked him. A talented artist with a long beard and curly hair, working late into the night on a sculpture of Halanna.\n\nAnd between one chisel-stroke and the next, the man disappears. Well before dawn, [Root.Monarch.GetName] returns home, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face expressionless, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes bright."

Indeed, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has been tempted by the idea: half the influence-seeking plots, half the foolish schemes, half the unsought 'advice'. While a few specimens stand out, who do offer useful council, the vast majority have nothing to offer. A more selfish and self-centered lot could not be found anywhere in [Root.GetName].\n\nThus, the [Root.Monach.GetTitle] rests easy having thinned their number by one, knowing few will note the absence, and fewer care.

Just as [Root.Monarch.GetName] had dragged [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] victim into an alleyway and begun to feed, at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most vulnerable, torches appeared at the alley's mouth, And the motley crew of uniformed men it illuminated sparked a feeling very unfamiliar to the predator tonight: fear."
