 vampire_ruler.0.t:0 "Vampire Ruler is Revealed"
 vampire_ruler.0.d:0 "For years now our [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ruled the country secretly as a vampire. Whilst there have been rumours about his their true identity remained a secret.\nRecently the rumours have been increasing and it is becoming more and more difficult to deny them, it is only a matter of time now until the [Root.Monarch.GetName] is exposed, if we are to act now we can still preserve the masquerade but it will require [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepping down and living a life of obscurity."
 vampire_ruler.0.a:0 "For the Masquerade, I must step down"
 vampire_ruler.0.b:0 "This is MY realm"
 human_heir:0 "Our ruler will step down and the appropriate successor will take over. §RVampiric heirs will not be able to take the throne.§!"
 
 vampire_ruler.1.t:0 "Age Draws Suspicion"
 vampire_ruler.1.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has ruled [Root.GetName] for many years now, and some are beginning to question the lack of any visible aging. Their face remains young and hale, not a speck of grey in their hair, and their eyes retain their uncanny allure.\n\nIf [Root.Monarch.GetName] is to continue ruling then extreme measures should be taken to preverse the secrecy of their identity."
 vampire_ruler.1.a:0 "Fortunately I already have an heir"
 vampire_ruler.1.b:0 "I will fake my own death!"
 vampire_ruler.1.c:0 "I will never step down!"
 vampire_ruler.1.e:0 "Perhaps I should adjust their memories of me"
 
 vampire_ruler.2.t:0 "An Inquisitive Advisor"
 vampire_ruler.2.d:0 "One of our advisors has grown curious as of late, what with our ruler's late night excursions and unusual nature, and so took it upon themselves to investigate further.\n\nIf they were simply a peasant with a wandering mind, this would not be troubling, due to the long-standing measures taken to preserve the identity of our ruler. However, likely due to their proximity to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the advisor has pierced this veil, realized [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s true nature is now threatening to expose them!"
 vampire_ruler.2.a:0 "Nobody will believe them"
 vampire_ruler.2.b:0 "Perhaps I can convince you not to talk"
 vampire_ruler.2.c:0 "Shame, I always did like you"
 
 vampire_ruler.3.t:0 "Wounded During Training"
 vampire_ruler.3.d:0 "It is not unusual for rulers to spar with their generals and other nobles in the realm, and it is extremely rare for serious injuries to occur in such a duel but such things happen.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] suffered such an injury in his duel earlier today. Fortunately, due to their vampiric nature, they were left with no permanent damage, but it has left some rather awkward questions as to how [Root.Monarch.GetName] survived."
 vampire_ruler.3.a:0 "It wasn't that bad..."
 vampire_ruler.3.b:0 "Me? Wounded?"
 
 vampire_ruler.4.t:0 "Invitation to a Banquet"
 vampire_ruler.4.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been invited to visit the court of a great noble family for a banquet. Accepting such an invitation would require great effort be taken to avoid drawing attention to our [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s vampiric nature. While they are under no obligation to attend such an event, it would be seen as a sign of disrespect and certainly draw this family's enmity.\n\nBut should a lion really be concerned with the feelings of sheep?"
 vampire_ruler.4.a:0 "Take measures to preserve [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s identity"
 vampire_ruler.4.b:0 "I will have to decline"
 
 vampire_ruler.5.t:0 "Sire's Request"
 vampire_ruler.5.d:0 "As a Vampire Spawn [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the responsibility of their Sire, the vampire who granted [Root.Monarch.GetName] the Blood Gift, and as such must follow their orders, regardless of their status as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nRecently [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Sire has begun making exorbatent demands of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], demanding they are granted special privileges."
 vampire_ruler.5.a:0 "I must Oblige"
 vampire_ruler.5.b:0 "They do not Command me!"
 
 vampire_ruler.6.t:0 "Overlapping Authority"
 vampire_ruler.6.d:0 "Reports have reached us of a Feral Vampire acting within the capital, drawing attention to our ruler and other vampires in our country, the Vampire Estate has demanded our assistance in hunting down and destroying this vampire. While traditionally this is handled by the Vampiric Estate, our rulers unique status as a Vampire means they have some sovereignity in these matters and could overrule them if nessecary."
 vampire_ruler.6.a:0 "My domain, my rules"
 vampire_ruler.6.b:0 "Assist the Vampire estate"
 vampire_ruler.6.c:0 "It is not worth the cost"
 
 vampire_ruler.7.t:0 "Siring an Heir"
 vampire_ruler.7.d:0 "Vampires are heavily restricted from Siring new heirs, as doing so without caution brings great risk to the masquerade. Any new heirs must be approved by other Vampires in the realm and the heir must be carefully selected.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has found the perfect candidate for the blood gift. The only question that remains now is, how will they serve [Root.Monarch.GetName]?"
 vampire_ruler.7.a:0 "They shall succeed me"
 vampire_ruler.7.b:0 "They shall serve me as an advisor"
 vampire_ruler.7.c:0 "They shall lead our armies"
 vampire_ruler.7.e:0 "This would draw attentions"
 add_vampire_heir:0 "An §Gheir§! will be §Ysired§! should our ruler choose to stand down allowing us to keep a vampiric ruler"
 
 vampire_ruler.8.t:0 "Hosting a Grand Masquerade"
 vampire_ruler.8.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has begun contemplating the organization of a grand masquerade, one that would even invite foreign dignitaries. Wine -- and other liquids -- would flow, there would be feasting aplenty, and the entire court would dance the night away.\n\nSuch an event would certainly improve relations with our neightbours greatly, but it would not be cheap."
 vampire_ruler.8.a:0 "We will host this Masquerade"
 vampire_ruler.8.b:0 "It is too expensive"
 
 vampire_ruler.10.t:0 "The Endless Hunger"
 vampire_ruler.10.d:0 "All vampires know the hunger, a nagging urge always in their mind. It is something no vampires cannot escape from, no matter their power and resolve, and eventually they will be consumed by that urge.\n\nSome nights the hunger is distant and a vampire can almost pretend they do not feel it. Some nights it niggles at the mind, a small itch, but one that cannot be scratched. And on nights like tonight? Tonight a hunger consuems [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 vampire_ruler.10.a:0 "I must hunt"
 vampire_ruler.10.b:0 "I will control myself"
 vampire_ruler.10.c:0 "I... Must... §RFEED§!"
 vampire_ruler.10.e:0 "The Blood Court is always prepared for this"
 
 vampire_ruler.11.t:0 "The Beast Inside"
 vampire_ruler.11.d:0 "Keeping control is no easy task for a vampire. They all know the pull of the Beast, the monster that lives within every vampire threatening to take them over. And as [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows, one that beast begins to pull, there is only one way to stave it off.\n\nTonight, the yearning has struck our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] course of action seems clear."
 vampire_ruler.11.a:0 "A beast I am, lest a beast I become"
 vampire_ruler.11.b:0 "I will control myself"
 vampire_ruler.11.c:0 "I... Must... §RFEED§!"
 
 vampire_ruler.12.t:0 "The Unending Obsession"
 vampire_ruler.12.d:0 "Whilst vampires may seem to retain the desires they had before their turning there is truly only one thing that occupies their thoughts: blood. "
 vampire_ruler.12.a:0 "I will indulge, but only a little"
 vampire_ruler.12.b:0 "I will control myself"
 vampire_ruler.12.c:0 "I... Must... §RFEED§!"
 
 vampire_ruler.13.t:0 "The Hunt Begins"
 vampire_ruler.13.d:0 "It is well known that vampires hunt, going out on nightly incursions to find prey from whom they drain the blood, but less well known that there is more to hunting than simple nourishment; a good part of the reason vampires hunt is for the chase itself.\nWith all the nessecary preparations complete [Root.Monarch.GetName] heads out, searching for the victim who will be their prey tonight."
 vampire_ruler.13.a:0 "Let the hunt begin"
 vampire_ruler.13.b:0 "I should not draw attention"
 
 vampire_ruler.14.t:0 "The Hunt - A Feral Vampire"
 vampire_ruler.14.d:0 "Recent rumours have cought [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s attention tonight: a lurker in the shadows of [Root.Capital.GetName], preying on its populace late at night and leaving nothing but empty corposes behind. This is undoubtedly not the fault of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who treats satiation with much more care and respect -- it must be a feral vampire.\n\nAnd so, amidst darkened streets only lit by moon-sliver, [Root.Monarch.GetName] begins to hunt the would-be hunter. From shadows, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] watches the shadows; from roof-tops, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] watches the rooftops; with a predator's eye, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] considers what another predator might focus on.\n\nAnd then -- movement where there should not be. A rival? No. A victim, of circumstance -- and soon of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s blade."
 vampire_ruler.14.a:0 "They cannot be left alive"
 vampire_ruler.14.b:0 "I should desist"
 
 vampire_ruler.15.t:0 "The Hunt - A Vampire Hunter"
 vampire_ruler.15.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] left their seat of power to hunt, but as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stalked the streets, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had a disquieting feeling: that they were being stalked in turn. And now, at the sight of a cloaked man also roaming [Root.Capital.GetName]'s streets, whose steel-tipped wooden stakes glint in the moonlight, it is clear that someone would turn our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] from predator into prey.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] could attempt an ambush, matching their pursuer head-on, but such a course of action would be risky. No matter what, it is clear tonight's feeding must be done with care, or perhaps abandoned entirely... but not for long."
 vampire_ruler.15.a:0 "You die here and now fiend!"
 vampire_ruler.15.b:0 "I cannot draw attention"
 vampire_ruler.15.c:0 "I will wait them out in our safe havens"

 vampire_ruler.17.a:0 "I will have to wait until another time"
 vampire_ruler.17.b:0 "Just a little longer..."
 
 vampire_ruler.18.t:0 "The Hunt - Mesmerize Tavern Goer"
 vampire_ruler.18.d:0 "It was almost too easy. [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided the hunting grounds would be the tavern, they arrived late at night, after everyone had been drinking for a few hours. Finding a suitable candidate they swiftly mesmerized them and took them to a private room. The victim will survive but they will not remember [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s face."
 vampire_ruler.18.a:0 "All without incident"
 
 vampire_ruler.19.t:0 "The Hunt - Like a Shadow"
 vampire_ruler.19.d:0 "Tonight, [Root.Capital.GetName] laid in darkness, and it was a darkness of three parts.\n\nThe most obvious darkness was the comforting darkness of the main square, lurking between areas of torchlight. A darkness constantly pierced by the opening of a tavern door and the outpour of light and music, but all-embracing in the moments in-between. In the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palatial estate, many slept, and those that did not primarily did their work in a darkness of another kind, a darkness foreshadowing the deeds of days and weeks and years to come.\n\nAnd there was a third darkness, not an easy thing to notice. The darkness of [Root.Monarch.GetName], as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] walked the streets confidently, patiently, in obscurity. A darkness that crept and prowled, raced and held granite-still; a darkness well-familiar to the hunting panther or watchful owl.\n\nIn due time, the darkness found one of the inhabitants of [Root.GetCapitalName], and marked him. An artist with a long beard and curly hair, working late into the night on a sculpture of Halanna. And between one chisel-stroke and the next, the man disappears.\n\nWell before dawn, [Root.Monarch.GetName] returns home, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face expressionless, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes bright."

Should he fail here [Root.Monarch.GetName] will certainly be killed, however should he succeed this will be the last of the hunters for a while.	"
