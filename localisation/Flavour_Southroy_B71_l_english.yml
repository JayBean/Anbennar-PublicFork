 B71_southroy_culture_desc:0"The Duchy of Southroy became a vassal of the Lorentish monarchs peacefully, but the Lencori of their lands have waged a silent conquest all the same, as the passage of time brought more and more foreigners to Iochand, diluting the old ways of our people. These outsiders care little for the Gnomish traditions we once shared. We must bring the Lencori back into the fold, and reforge our common identity as Iochanders, so that together we can build a new future."
