 cannorian_1_medieval_infantry:0 "Medieval Infantry"
 cannorian_1_medieval_infantryDESCR:0 "The basic soldier of Cannorian armies. They tended to be peasant levies with little or no training and very poor equipment. However when deployed en masse they could be devastating.."
 cannorian_1_medieval_knights:0 "Medieval Knights"
 cannorian_1_medieval_knightsDESCR:0 "The medieval Knight originated with the Castanorian hero Caylen Longlance's reforms, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread through Cannor and became an integral part of the feudal system, in which knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."
 cannorian_5_longbow:0 "Damerian Longbowmen"
 cannorian_5_longbowDESCR:0 "Despite the elven stereotype of being master-archers, it was actually their long-term allies, the Damerians, that taught them the art of the bow. Up until the end of the Lilac Wars, the longbow was the Damerian weapon-of-choice, and were the bane of many a Lorentish knight."
 cannorian_5_men_at_arms:0 "Men-at-Arms"
 cannorian_5_men_at_armsDESCR:0 "The Man-at-Arms was a professional soldier in Cannorian armies of the late middle ages. Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier, often bearing steel from the many foundries and workshops that rose during the time, such as the dwarves of Silverforge and the Vanburies of Telgeir. During the Lilac Wars, Men-at-Arms were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights. The better equipped and better trained were known as Sergeants-at-Arms."
 cannorian_9_adventurer_band:0 "Adventurer Bands"
 cannorian_9_adventurer_bandDESCR:0 "Adventurers have been both a boon and a bane across Cannor for years. Often troublesome, but also offering a wide breadth of experience and insight beyond the common soldier - by integrating adventurers within our armies it allows us to cover a wide breadth of situations and draw upon their expertise."
 cannorian_9_pike_and_shot:0 "Pike & Shot"
 cannorian_9_pike_and_shotDESCR:0 "It is said that the Pike & Shot helped win the Greentide - and that the thunderous roar of gunfire caused even the bravest of orcish hordes to hesitate. Earlier variants had heavily armoured pikemen and halberdiers supported by embedded arquebusiers in order to both strike fear and gun down orcs and be able to face them in close combat. After the Greentide the armoured pikemen portion slowly fell out of favour to lighter cuirasses or no heavy armour at all."
 cannorian_10_gun_knights:0 "Gun Knights"
 cannorian_10_gun_knightsDESCR:0 "With the advent of smaller firearms by gnomish inventors, knights and other heavy cavalrymen often carried several pistols with them in battle to discharge at close range during their charges."
 cannorian_12_thorn_formation:0 "Thorn Formation"
 cannorian_12_thorn_formationDESCR:0 "The Thorn Formation was a mixed infantry formation of pikemen and musketeers. Because of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed both the rigidity of its heavy infantry and the long-range firepower of its musketeers, making it an ideal defensive and offensive formation. Originally developed by the Lorentish general Darien síl Ainethán during its Wars of Dominion against Gawed it proved that a smaller, defensive and elite Lorentish force could defeat the larger mass of Gawedi infantry (who at that time were still primarily using melee weapons)."
 cannorian_14_outriders:0 "Outriders"
 cannorian_14_outridersDESCR:0 "As guns became more easily mass-produced the role of the knight in mounted combat diminished. No longer did cavalry need specialized training, money or noble-birth, but instead simply be able to charge, swing and shoot."
 cannorian_15_volley_infantry:0 "Volley Infantry"
 cannorian_15_volley_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Halfling War of Independence the halfling armies were outmatched by the pike/musket combination of the Lorentish Thorn Formations. As halflings could not wield pikes due to their stature, they developed a new tactic relying on mass fire with lines twelve, six or eight musketeers deep. When the first ranked line fired, they would run move to the rear and the second line would fire. Due to the availability of muskets and more importantly, the large populations of halflings, this system negated the long reload relating to muskets, and stood well against the more defensive and stationary Thorn Formation."
 cannorian_18_reformed_outriders:0 "Reformed Outriders"
 cannorian_18_reformed_outridersDESCR:0 "The advent of more reliable and accurate guns reformed the army as a whole, moving to a lighter armoured infantry core that wielded rifles as their primary weapon. In return heavy armour was no longer prized in battle, as the usual bullet could penetrate it, and outriders soon abandoned heavier plate to just a simple breastplate."
 cannorian_19_thorn_formation2:0 "Ashen Thorn Formation"
 cannorian_19_thorn_formation2DESCR:0 "Over time bullets became deadlier and armour became more and more obsolete. As armies changed to lighter cavalry and less-armoured infantry, the famous Thorn Formation replaced a large majority of their pikemen with more musketeers, hence the 'ash'."
 cannorian_23_dragoons:0 "Escanni Dragoons"
 cannorian_23_dragoonsDESCR:0 "In 17th century Escann, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon (named after the core sigil of Escann). Dragoons were widely used by all Cannorian nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 cannorian_23_line_infantry:0 "Line Infantry"
 cannorian_23_line_infantryDESCR:0 "Line infantry tactics tried to find a balance between attack and defense and did not specialize in either. However, these infantry were stronger in fire and shock. Their aim would be to use the musket volleys to disorganize the enemy before they could charge, in particular if they were primarily a shock action force."
 cannorian_26_carabiners:0 "Carabiners"
 cannorian_26_carabinersDESCR:0 "The Carabiners first came into being in the 16th century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armor, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between them was their armament. Carabiners main weapon was the carabine, sometimes also called the arquebus, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carabine, they were also armed with pistols and a sword."
 cannorian_26_rosecoat_infantry:0 "Rosecoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_rosecoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Rosecoat infantry seek to emulate Lorent's founder, Lorenan the Great, and his devastating charges against the Gawed invaders."
 cannorian_26_dovecoat_infantry:0 "Dovecoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_dovecoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Due to the high population of Anbennar, Dovecoat infantry focused on simply taking volleys and overwhelming the enemy with numbers."
 cannorian_26_dragoncoat_infantry:0 "Dragoncoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_dragoncoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Dragoncoat infantry rely on being able to take damage and deal it back tenfold, similar to how a dragon's scale can withstand damage and a dragon's breathe can cause it."
 cannorian_28_impulse_infantry:0 "Impulse Infantry"
 cannorian_28_impulse_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Wars of the Northern League, the main Gawedi army was outmatched and faltering. To make up for this, irregular units from the frontier, such as hunters from the Greatwoods, were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed Gawedi armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the Cannorian battlefield. The most extreme solution was the impulse warfare unit. These units put forward a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."
 cannorian_28_cuirassier:0 "Cuirassier"
 cannorian_28_cuirassierDESCR:0 "The Cuirassier takes its name from the Cuirass, a breast plate worn by the heaviest cavalry units. Wielding a heavy sword rather than a light saber, these units are fearsome when they charge. Usually supported by units of carbine equipped cavalry to give them extra punch, these units add shock power to any army."
 cannorian_30_drill_infantry:0 "Ancardian Drill Infantry"
 cannorian_30_drill_infantryDESCR:0 "The Ancardian Reforms revolutionized early modern warfare, instilling the reliance of simple yet effective drills to not only maximize firepower output but a reinforced and near-unbreakable line."
 cannorian_30_sparkdrive_irregulars:0 "Sparkdrive Irregulars"
 cannorian_30_sparkdrive_irregularsDESCR:0 "The Sparkdrive Rifle was a strange gnomish invention that was said to contain an essence of a lightning elemental, operated by a rotating lever that charged the rifle and shot a burst of concentrated lightning. Eventually these Sparkdrive companies, also known as 'Cranker Companies' after the sound of the lever, were a prized part of warfare, often used to snipe enemy commanders in the battlefield, and even targetting armies as they camped."

 dwarven_1_shieldwall:0 "Shieldwalls"
 dwarven_1_shieldwallDESCR:0 "An ancient military tactic, the shieldwall was no doubt done best by its creators, the dwarves. A line of armorclad warriors holding iron-plated tower shields separated by thin gaps to let pikes through, this strategy has proven an effective defensive formation time and time again, ensuring both the safety of dwarven men and the slow demise of the enemy."
 dwarven_5_massed_clockwork_bows:0 "Massed Clockwork Bows"
 dwarven_5_massed_clockwork_bowsDESCR:0 "The fall of Aul-Dwarov saw much knowledge lost to the ages, but a few remnants of military ingenuity remain. The primary example of this was the Clockwork Bow, an alloyed composite bow capable of exerting pressure on its own coiled steel bowstring. The additional tension helps to launch bolts at unfathomable speeds, making quick work of hostile warbands when launched in concentrated volleys. Expense and tradition would make such items much more expensive than contemporary crossbows, and eventually would be phased out by firearms."
 dwarven_5_tortoise_formation:0 "Tortoise Formation"
 dwarven_5_tortoise_formationDESCR:0 "The life of a single dwarf is worth far more than the death of a single goblin, and thus dwarven military doctrine tended to prioritize self-preservation above all else. This concept was realized in the classic Tortoise Formation, a mix between the classic shieldwall and the one-sided phalanx. Though ultimately situational, its ability to defend from missiles and footmen alike made it a mainstay of adventurer bands in the Dwarovar during the early stages of the Reclamation."
 dwarven_9_pepper_and_tortoise:0 "Pepper and Tortoise"
 dwarven_9_pepper_and_tortoiseDESCR:0 "Though good at keeping dwarven soldiers alive, the classical Tortoise Formation lacked any semblance of maneuverability or offensive capability. With recent advancements in clockwork and gunpowder weaponry, this weakness was quickly rectified, stationing ranged 'Pepperers' in the middle of the tortoise shell with small openings for projectiles to pass through. This method allowed the formation to maintain its rigid defense whilst maintaining some semblance of pressure on the enemy."
 dwarven_9_remnant_harquebusiers:0 "Remnant Harquebusiers"
 dwarven_9_remnant_harquebusiersDESCR:0 "One of the many technologies salvaged from the fall of Aul-Dwarov, the methods regarding the construction and upkeep of firearms were largely lost, leaving survivors with remarkably few instances of true arquebi. This all changed with the eventual progression of smithing precision and production utilities, eventually culminating in the first widespread recreation of ancient dwarven firearms: the dwarven harquebus. Though ultimately less effective than the Cannorian arquebus that, within a few decades, would dominate Cannorian warfare, it was an important stepping stone in the pursuit of lost knowledge, and especially the pursuit of even deadlier weapons."
 dwarven_12_clockwork_riflemen:0 "Clockwork Riflemen"
 dwarven_12_clockwork_riflemenDESCR:0 "Many of the shortcomings present in the harquebus were soon addressed by adapting the clockwork mechanics of dwarven bows and crossbows into the loading and priming mechanisms of modern firearms. The results were vastly improved firing speeds, and despite the relative weakness of each projectile, the sheer quantity of bullets was enough to drown out any potential critics of the unreliable weapons."
 dwarven_12_runic_greataxes:0 "Runic Greataxes"
 dwarven_12_runic_greataxesDESCR:0 "Despite runesmithing's decline outside of the Dwarovar, inside the vast mountain range the practice was very much alive. Runes of durability were engraved upon the pommels of mithril-etched greataxes, wielded by elite warriors in enchanted armor to serve as the vanguard of a hold's grand army. Few of the dwarves' machinations managed to inspire fear into the remnants of Korgus' empire as well as the sheer power of these weapons of unending death."
 dwarven_15_fire_and_tortoise:0 "Fire and Tortoise"
 dwarven_15_fire_and_tortoiseDESCR:0 "Violently clinging to life, the ancient Tortoise Formation experienced a notable resurgence at the dawn of the 17th century with its unique ability to prove an immovable obstacle on the battlefield. Replacing the iron shields of old with dwarven steel made for effective bulletproof mobile fortifications, allowing the short-statured gunmen to take up superior positions and rain hell upon the fiends that dared to stand in their sights."
 dwarven_15_scattergun_auxiliaries:0 "Scattergun Auxiliaries"
 dwarven_15_scattergun_auxiliariesDESCR:0 "As the rest of the world managed to grasp the foundations of blackpowder warfare, the dwarves were already adapting these rudimentary tactics into the field of unconventional warfare. Harquebus-fire lacked the versatility to deal with stagnant lines or study fortifications, and thus from the cradle of necessity, the scattergun was brought into the world. Firing a close spread of pellets as opposites to a single ball, the scattergun managed to maintain relevance in both long-range skirmishes and close-range engagements. Despite its apparent effectiveness, its lack of durability and the inability of runesmiths to rectify this issue ultimately doomed it to early retirement."
 dwarven_19_rotary_vanguards:0 "Rotary Vanguards"
 dwarven_19_rotary_vanguardsDESCR:0 "New and improved rotary guns utilize existing clockwork technology to spin a four-barrel tube, ejecting high-velocity ordinance at an unprecedented rate. Its lack of accuracy and inability to move during use were major flaws, but its raw destructive power oft compensated for its tactical shortcomings. By placing these devastating weapons at the head of the vanguard, dwarven armies were able to substantially soften up enemies before the main force engaged."
 dwarven_19_skullcrusher_brigades:0 "Skullcrusher Brigades"
 dwarven_19_skullcrusher_brigadesDESCR:0 "The ever-present traditionalist movements present in dwarven society had great impact even in the army, with many dwarves choosing to adapt the fierce tactics employed by the adventurer bands of old into modern formations in an attempt to relive the glory of the Reclamation. Though these attempts typically ended in disaster, the Skullcrusher Brigades were a notable exception. Comprised of veteran adventurers and expeditionaries, these units employed an odd mix of warriors, rangers, and mages to wreak havoc upon enemy lines in a horrific cacophony of bloodshed and terror."
 dwarven_23_grudgesettlers:0 "The Grudgesettlers"
 dwarven_23_grudgesettlersDESCR:0 "A new generation of adventurers means a new generation of veterans–and new faces to fight for the same grudges of old. As the Skullcrusher Brigades began to retire, the unsettled grudges of the last remnants of the Reclamation spurred new blood to form independent units of mercenary-adventurers, continuing the Skullcrushers' role in the battlefield wielding firearms laced with an incendiary agent. It is said that as the corpses of our enemies smolder, retribution for past transgressions grows ever-closer to being fully paid."
 dwarven_23_steelcoat_infantry:0 "Steelcoat Infantry"
 dwarven_23_steelcoat_infantryDESCR:0 "The Cannorians truly lack a sense of naming. They boast so-called 'Dovecoat Infantry', despite the pigeons possessing no viciousness nor strength on their own. The resolve of a dwarf cannot be relegated to a mere bird. With skin made of iron and steel in our bones, we have devised a far more fitting, and far more literal, moniker. Dwarven Steelcoat Infantrymen don coats lined with thin, lightweight sheets of steel to provide additional defense against the pesky pellets that other races are so fond of flinging."
 dwarven_26_hotshot_rotary_gunners:0 "Hotshot Rotary Gunners"
 dwarven_26_hotshot_rotary_gunnersDESCR:0 "Rudimentary gun placements modified to accept incendiary ammunition, these upgraded rotary guns address many of the issues prevalent in previous designs. Primarily, the lack of maneuverability had been fixed by reducing the caliber the weapon uses, with bullets each engraved with a flame rune to substitute for the overall loss in firepower."
 dwarven_26_splintered_tortoise_formation:0 "Splintered Tortoise Formation"
 dwarven_26_splintered_tortoise_formationDESCR:0 "The final iteration before its eventual extinction, the famed Tortoise Formation found new life with the propagation of stationary rotary guns in the modern battlefield. The minor improvements in mobility allowed the guns to move alongside the slothful tortoise shell, with specialized shielding placed at the front of the guns as both protection and for gunners to camouflage into the immutable formation."
 dwarven_28_forgefire_repeaters:0 "Forgefire Repeaters"
 dwarven_28_forgefire_repeatersDESCR:0 "The resurgence of clockwork mechanisms in the late 18th century gave rise to a number of clockwork assault rifles, the most famous of which was the Forgefire Repeater. The name itself was an exonym given to standard clockwork rifles paired with rune-enhanced incendiary rounds, though it was ultimately a fitting one, for these weapons truly put whomever was unfortunate enough to be caught in their fire through a crucible akin to a forge, with the only survivors being those able to withstand the heat and be tempered by the experience."
 dwarven_28_matchbeard_mortars:0 "Matchbeard Mortars"
 dwarven_28_matchbeard_mortarsDESCR:0 "Originally reserved for the backlines, mortars began to see increased use in the front lines of dwarven armies with shorter fuses and lighter frames compensating for their general unwieldiness. The operators of these new mortars were known as Matchbeards, mainly due to their odd appearances: embroidered beards with matches woven between each braid, so that regardless of the situation, a fuse could be lit."
 dwarven_30_gemstone_beamsplitters:0 "Gemstone Beamsplitters"
 dwarven_30_gemstone_beamsplittersDESCR:0 "A glorious symphony of rune magic and artificery, the dwarven beamsplitters represent the peak of dwarven magical weaponry. A damestear core designed to supply a number of mithril conductors with raw magical energy to pass a powerful beam of pure magic through an intricately-runecrafted gemstone. The beam's quality's could be changed by swapping the type of gemstone, or by modifying the facets to alter the beam's angle, power, or elemental resonance. Though lacking in pure power, its versatility is ultimately what made these mechanisms dominate the battlefield in the early 19th century."
 dwarven_30_mithrilcoat_infantry:0 "Mithrilcoat Infantry"
 dwarven_30_mithrilcoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Donning their metal coats once more, the legendary Steelcoats of old enjoyed a comfortable, lightweight upgrade in the form of mithril coats capable of deflecting both blade and bullet, with particular resistance to black damestear. It was Mithrilcoats that ultimately constituted the bulk of dwarven armies during the early 19th century, with their white coats quickly becoming a feared sight for all."

 dwarven_6_ram_riders:0 "Ram Riders"
 dwarven_6_ram_ridersDESCR:0 "Cavalry has never been a core contingent of dwarven armies due to their short stature and defensive orientation. In cases where an enemy army refuses to be broken the dwarven offensive is led by a shattering charge of warbred rams, often guaranteeing an enemy rout."
 dwarven_10_ramsteel_chargers:0 "Ramsteel Chargers"
 dwarven_10_ramsteel_chargersDESCR:0 "The reclamation of Orlazam-az-dihr and surrounding lands has brought forth the propagation of Ramsteel, an ancient metal thought to be lost to the Final Days. Its incredible strength combined with relatively light weight makes it the ideal metal to outfit ram rider regiments with. Though cavalry still made up an insignificant portion of most dwarven armies, it was this rediscovery that would maintain the ram's role into the future."
 dwarven_14_caverntrot_outriders:0 "Caverntrot Outriders"
 dwarven_14_caverntrot_outridersDESCR:0 "Cavalry's inability to effectively flank the enemy in tight caverns often forced combatants to exclude its use from battles. Such poor resource management was unbefitting of the dwarves, who would eventually, through a combination of selective breeding and refitted hooves, reintroduce the ram to cavern combat as an effective mainstay."
 dwarven_18_clockwork_ram_rangers:0 "Clockwork Ram Rangers"
 dwarven_18_clockwork_ram_rangersDESCR:0 "The resurgence of clockwork weaponry following the Reclamation gave rise to many odd contraptions and weapons, though none saw as much use as the Clockwork Rifle. The convenience of the loading and firing mechanisms combined with its relative light weight made these weapons a favorite of the dwarven ram riders, allowing the riders to maintain continuous fire even whilst handling a burly ram."
 dwarven_23_rune_dragoons:0 "Rune Dragoons"
 dwarven_23_rune_dragoonsDESCR:0 "Plated with enchanted ramsteel armor further enhanced with traditional runemagic, the Rune Dragoons were a terrifying sight on the battlefield. Boasting clockwork pistols and rune-enhanced steeds, the dragoons could swiftly enter combat with their repeating weaponry, cause as much havoc as possible, then leave to make way for the bulk of the frontline."
 dwarven_28_mecharams:0 "Mecha-Ram Cavalry"
 dwarven_28_mecharamsDESCR:0 "Rapid advancements in artificery and rune magic have given rise to the Mecha-Ram, a fully mechanical replacement for the rams typically seen carrying dwarven riders. These steel beasts do not flinch in the heat of battle, and with the ergonomics of the mount fully configurable, small stature was no longer a hindrance to potential cavalrymen. Overwhelming firepower may inspire fear in the enemy, but only the mecha-ram can truly bring the fight beyond the frontlines and run down a rout."

 emerald_orc_1_emerald_hordeDESCR:0 "While our warriors are loyal to their warlords regardless of what our dealings with the Fey are, the average warrior is unaffected by the fey magic, and remains orcish, and nothing more.

 emerald_orc_23_druidic_warriorsDESCR:0 "Ever since that first forest encounter, we have drawn power from the Fey, but now many among us are veritable druids, who can draw upon the Feyrealm's magic to their own ends. Because of the generally ritualistic nature of their magic, it is preferable that we do not risk losing them in battle in the front of our armies, as they are far more useful providing support from behind. When it comes down to it, however, all of these druids are warriors in their own right, and will employ their magic alongside their blades in combat."
 emerald_orc_26_archfey_warlocks:0 "Archfey Warlocks"
 emerald_orc_26_archfey_warlocksDESCR:0 "As we have become more deeply fey, we have moved beyond the need for druidic rituals, with many among us granted magic directly from the Feyrealm. It is unwieldy and chaotic, but undeniably powerful: those who can harness it tend to become part of Tugund-Darakh's elite, and they will be unstoppable when unleashed directly at our enemies."

 emerald_orc_28_wildsight_rangersDESCR:0 "Some of those blessed with the truesight may venture into the untrodden depths of the Deepwood, as if called by something. Those that return are not the same: they no longer just perceive all things around them, but also things that, according to others' eyes, are not there at all. Some respect these wildsight rangers as deeply Fey-touched, others simply call them mad, but all acknowledge they are scouts and ambushers with no parallel."

 eordand_1_court_knightsDESCR:0 "Following the splintering of the Eordan into the seasonal courts, each corner of the realm fell unto control of whoever was strongest. Whether through harnessing great magical power from the seasons themselves, or simply being the strongest warlord able to ward off such power, a warrior elite soon formed from the victors of this chaos. Armed and armored with the finest bronze and mounted upon antlered beasts, the elite of the court devotees fought as armored bulwarks and commanders in the heat of battle. Some, through their great devotion to their cause, were able to call upon the power of the seasons in battle to great effect."

 eordand_1_dusken_raidersDESCR:0 "Like flies drawn to rot, mercenaries and sellswords jockey for pay in battle and plunder thereafter. The wars between the seasonal courts brought death and devastation to the land and its people, inspiring great desperation. So-called Wild Riders, these lightly-armored and mobile miscreants are known to blaspheme in their trespasses into the Domandrod as hiding places. Their underhanded tactics have made them useful allies, often striking at the most vulnerable targets, even including medics and camp followers."

 eordand_1_ruin_garrisonDESCR:0 "With the constant wars that have plagued Eordand since the failure of Pelodan the First to reassert the authority of the Fey, fortifications around Precursor ruins have become an integral part of the landscape. The armies of the different states are typically formed out of soldiers who spend most of their time defending these fortifications, only leaving during wartime. When called upon for battles in the open field, the garrison forces would primarily form protective formations around groups of archers. Shield and spear units were preferred, being able to ward off enemy vollies, but were often vulnerable to powerful spellcasters and more mobile enemies."

 eordand_1_pelodan_remnantsDESCR:0 "The schism of the Eordan lead Pelodan the First to rally the faithful Peitar against the heretics. Although he was unsuccessful in his quest, the many wars have lead to great experience among the Peitar clans. Across the varied landscape of Eordand, the remnants of Pelodan's cause adapt to the land. Whether at home in deep forests, across craggy hills or windswept plains, the Peitar warriors ever fight for a nigh-unwinnable cause with unending zeal.

Facing the brunt of the frigid northern winds and the Snecboth within, the forces of Eighard devoted their magical power to combating this threat. Wielding enchanted armor that wards off the cold, and arms that melt through the defensive ice of the Snecboth, the Thawswords of Darblath broke through the icy deadlock and further into the Randrunnse. The armies of Darblath, unlike traditional Autumn Court tactics, fought aggressively to root out hidden Snecboth and attempt to chase them encirclement."

Serving as the greatest defensive units, the Patina Guard was equipped with heavy plate and shields reaching from toe to eye, almost to the point of overencumberance. Typically outfitted with long spear rested upon grooves in the shields, the Patina Guard served as an impenetrable barrier upon the battlefield.

Most prized of all are the antlered beasts of the deep forests, raised with great care by the Dearktirans to be mighty warhorses. Almost twice the size of the common Eordan horse, the Dearktiran elk breed is so highly prized that they are often considered much better fed and housed than the common people.\n\nThe elk of Dearktir are not only known for their size.

Riding upon wild great elk and outfitted with concealing furs, the elite of Gelcolle swiftly patrolled the frozen forests unseen.

Of all the claimants striving to fill this vacuum, the island order of Einsagg proved to be the true restorer. Separated from the mainland, the island of Einsagg proved to be an effective training ground for the new generation of warfare. Drilled with precision in formation tactics and outfitted with heavy armor and long spears, the Einsagg Legion prioritized defensive tactics. Building upon this traditional base, the Einsagg Legions were trained in amphibious assaults, as well as incorporating small companies of handgunners."

Lacking the tree cover of the vast forests, with sandstorms blowing in from the Egasach obscuring vision, and a general lack of water, the Trimgarb Peitar have held off invaders from their land for centuries. In times of peace, the Waterblades act as the upholders of the law, especially so with the usage of precious water. When Trimgarb is threatened with war, the Waterblades act as their elite scouts and infiltrators. Enemy patrols vanish in the craggy hills when they face the lacerating blades, and most famously the fortress of Serakriok was taken from within by the Waterblades."

Armed with the latest prototypes, specially trained soldiers would utilize them in battle under close scrutiny of the Arakepruni scholars.

Raithtall, most immediate to Dorcurt and having absorbed many of its survivors, vowed to reclaim Dorcurt at any cost. Over the years the Raithtall cavalry began to become more organized around religious orders sworn to Autumn and even the Gloam Knight. Wielding golden-hued armor with capes of leaves, as well as lances and swords infused with the vengeful fire of Autumn, the Vengeance of the Golden smote the enemies of Raithtall on their sworn quest."

The Hibiscine Knights are known for their meticulous tradition of preparing and imbibing these bolstering medicines, elevating their skills and adapting to the battle at hand.

Developed in Jhorgashirr to combat rival Tuathak armies from Eighard and Slegcal, the Jhorgashirran Square was composed of forward-facing gunners flanked by pikemen. Each face of the square could then be guarded by further pikemen, or swapped with gunners to fire in each direction. The center of each square was often designated as a temporary command post, manned with officers and mages. Most effective at taking down enemy formations in an open field, the square would not be suitable against skirmishing forces from the Snecboth or Peitar."

Utilizing specially designed firearms that would produce a jet of fire instead of launching a missile, at close range the Sunfire was shot at the enemy setting them and the ground around them ablaze. While effective at burning and causing widespread fear, the Sidparen Sunfire was limited by the availability of skilled mages or druids who could manipulate and augment the flames."

Finding battles at a stalemate with unmoving infantry blocks, the Arakepruni inventors created a weapon to allow cavalry to once more make an impact. Armed with smaller firearms such as pistols, the Arakepruni Caracole fired at the enemy at range whilst always being on the move.

Made into a round shape, Mirrorshields not only reflect the image of objects before it, but also have the ability to absorb the blow of musket shot and release it as heat.

Across the seas and beyond the desert of the Haraf, Urdea Samrad was established as a new beacon of Summer. Establishing their city in a tumultuous time between the arrival of the Cannorians and the despicable artificers, the Urdean Towerkeep were faced with immense difficulty to defend their new home.

Riding atop their magestic antlered beasts, the Domcolle Honorguard swore to defend their hall to the death, something ever more likely thanks to the seemingly unstoppable advance of the Tuathak. Firing from range with both rifle and pistols until the last shot, obscured by the frozen pines, their skull masks and icy lances were seen as agents of death... perhaps true if sent from the dreaded Immariel herself."

Braving choking smog and infernal contraptions, the Smogbane struck in the blink of an eye, quickly firing at unsuspecting artificers and leaving behind bombs.

Seeking to chart and discover undocumented Precursor ruins to study, the Expedition forces would often travel as small armies to occupy their worksites.

In a league of its own, the blade was stolen and taken to lands even further beyond the mountains to the east.\n\nDarran Eaglesthorn, ruler of Slegcal, set his sights on reclaiming Dracball. First invading the Dragon Dominion in 1782, the armies of Slegcal tore their way through the Ynnic Valley until finally reclaiming the sword in Arganjuzorn.

Einnsag valiantly rallied the Autumn Court against their invaders and stopped them both at Darblath and in the seas at the pivotal battle of Gathmarkosk. In the south, the Vanbury Guild seized the Fograc lands and Kairncal from Murdkather and Arakeprun. While once enemies, the Autumn, Spring, and Summer Courts vowed to drive out their enemies at all costs.

The Boreal Dragoons served as the primary army of the Snecboth during the 18th century, armed with powerful carbines and mounted on quick elks.

Armed with Coldsteel, a difficult to produce metal shaped at low temperatures with the aid of magic, their weapons sliced through the invaders with ease. Utilizing reworked Precursor magic, Coldsteel could be produced more easily in rituals requiring the effort of trusted mages. Well-suited for slicing through armor and weapons forged from lesser metals, cuirassiers armed with Coldsteel were invaluable at combating both enemy cavalry and infantry.

As the first row of soldiers fire, they swiftly squat and begin reloading their weapons as the row behind them fires immediately over their heads, thus mitigating downtime and allowing for constant volley after volley.

Regardless of how advanced, strict, and strenuous the drills became it was impossible for new recruits to match the skill of veteran soldiers. After many long years of research and testing, the artificers of the Dragon Command had created a solution to this eternal problem, the Warfare Simulator. Through an advanced system of illusions soldiers could be trained and drilled for any conceivable battlefield condition before ever seeing true combat.

By making use of semi-professional soldiers who trained extensively during the monsoon seasons, the Nadimraj ensured a high standard of quality and a large potential population from which to draw its soldiery. This system fell out of favor when the ascension of the harimari consolidated military service among the tigerfolk, but the growing strength of human Raheni kingdoms and the threat of the hobgoblins would see the practice reinstituted during the late 1300s and come into full bloom by the 1460s."

The 1500s would see several major changes come to Raheni armies - longer pikes spread as they proved their efficacy not only against harimari chargers and war elephants but jaddari cavalry and warg riders. Unit sizes grew, taking advantage of the larger recruitable population, and flexible hobgoblin formations were adopted to allow fast redeployment of fresh men across the field."

These conditions attracted many fine military minds, including those fleeing chaos in the north, and saw a blossoming of new tactics among the Slave Knights of Bhuvauri. Though they had far less combat experience than their northern cousins, the Sarniryasbadi fielded refined, well drilled infantry with uniform equipment, troops unhindered by the exhaustion and desperation that plagued the Shamakhadi."

 raheni_12_khedarid_infantryDESCR:0 "When the Ruin Kingdoms fell and the Raj-Command wars began, the Rasarhids stood on the front-line against the hobgoblins. The Rasarhid favored a small, heavily armored infantry core supported by a large number of archers and early arquebusiers, who served as the true killing power of the army. Devastating volleys of arrows would prompt the enemy to approach strongly defended positions, where they would meet a solid wall of steel and will. Rasarhid infantry became famous for their rigid stoicism, holding formation even in the face of terrible odds, and though their static formations were inflexible they were among the most difficult forces in Rahen to rout."

 raheni_15_bhuvauri_squareDESCR:0 "Mass integration of blackpowder was a slow process throughout Rahen, though the Bhuvauri took to the practice faster than most. Building on their traditions of a well-drilled force, Sarniryasbadi Arquebusiers combined with strong pike formations deployed on barges along the Kharunyana to unleash withering fire on approaching enemies. These musketeers formed the backbone of the armies that fought the hobgoblins to a standstill in the Great Dhujat War. Though they lacked the ferocity of the harimari or mastery of the elves, the Bhuvauri were perhaps the most crucial element of the coalition, creating a wall of pike and shot that matched the discipline of the Hobgoblins and halted the Command in its tracks at the walls of Khiraspid."

Almost entirely abandoning traditional infantry as the musket proliferated and grew common in the foothills, as much as 80% of Ghankedhen armies would be armed with muskets by 1600. By leaving the bow behind entirely, the Ghankedhen would make the first major step in bringing Raheni armies fully into the era of Blackpowder."

Among these unwilling travelers were veterans of the Dhujat War, deprived of the lands granted to them for retirement. With no soil to till, these veteran legionaries flocked to the armies of the Bhuvauri, the Porcelain Cities,  and the western Bom States, forming an elite corps of exiles hell-bent on reclaiming their homes."

 raheni_23_nadimraj_musketeersDESCR:0 "The most major leap forward in the development of Raheni infantry was the combination of Ghankedhen  blackpowder units with the permanent armies of the Bhuvauri and mass-mobilization techniques of the Nadimraj. During the monsoon months conscripted reserves would practice their musket accuracy alongside professional soldiers. With months of dedicated practice each year, Raheni farmers became surprisingly accurate with firearms, and a valuable resource that could swell the ranks of Raheni armies to huge numbers of capable infantry, rapidly trained in soldiering by the professionals alongside whom they had practiced."

The ensuing explosive barrage would shatter formations, or open them up to an even more devastating second barrage, followed by either a volley of gunfire, or the roar of charging orcs."

When the Jadd brought Verkal Gulan into its light, and later Seghdihr to its knees, the Black Orcs of the Middle Dwarovar took notice as their age-old foes were brought to heel. When the first missionaries arrived, there was tension, and often violence, but from these elves a truth was soon revealed. Learning from the strong is not a weakness. It is a necessity. With our own soldiers humbled so thoroughly, all that remained was the drive to adapt. Adapt our guns, adapt our lines, adapt the heads of dwarves into the ground. The Jaddari missionaries taught us many things, and with this newfound knowledge, Black Orcs have become a semi-modern fighting force."

Longer barrels meant longer range, which ultimately translated to more volleys before melee. Though this departure from tradition left many orcs alienated, the results could simply not be ignored, ultimately reshaping Black Orcish military doctrine into a model similar to that of the Green Orcs of Cannor."

Faced with extinction or change, many chose change. This took the form of the Roadprowlers. Inspired by the warband of old, a Roadprowler Division is a logistical building block from which the modern Black Orcish army is built upon. With black and grey coats to help obscure them in the darkness of the caves from their enemies, Roadprowlers have equipped themselves with dwarven-inspired weaponry, such as repeaters or rifled muskets, usually raided from felled foes, but also made in growing quantity and quality by orcish hands."

Supplementing quaggoth slaves, these ogrillons are trained to be heavy shock forces from a young age. Clad in heavy plate on their fronts, their backs are left totally exposed, to both ensure that the taskmaster's whip finds purchase, and to ensure that retreat is punished with death; either by the enemy, or by an orcish blade."

However, when the occasional Black Orc Warband manages to cage a troll, it often results in a disaster waiting to happen. The regenerative properties of troll flesh are well known, and the troll is kept and “harvested” for flesh, which is then allowed to grow into new trolls to enslave as shock troops, or grafted onto existing enslaved trolls. The culmination of this is a small army of Dire Trolls; trolls that have been mutated and grafted together to create a monstrosity just as likely to eat the Dire Troll beside it as they are to eat the warband's enemies."

With avian and insectoid features, its disgusting exterior belies a cunning intelligence, as these creatures are not only pack hunters, but have been observed by certain hunters to possess some form of communication system. Regardless, these packs can be dominated and gained control of, either by shamans and magical enslavement, or simply beating the animals into shape and a taskmaster establishing themselves as the leader of the pack.

With no discernable origin, Ettins only appeared in the Western Serpentspine after the fall of the Segbandal. Regardless, their terrible higher thought makes them almost laughably easy to both arm, train, and send into battle with massive steel clubs, swords, or glaives while clad in spiked heavy steel armour, creating essentially a living, breathing, monumentally stupid wall."

Warhosts would organise themselves based on martial skill, with greatbow archers having their faces dyed green while the remaining gnolls painted red. In battle, archers would be massed into one large formation to fire salvos of arrows at their enemies until their quivers were empty. With the powerful draw weight of the gnollish greatbow, the archers would hypothetically be able to outrange their adversaries, leaving them at the mercy of gnollish arrows and blades on the battlefield."

Her retinue would be named the Skull-Cross Ravagers, named for their skull-motifs painted throughout their equipment (armour, helmets, and even faces). The Ravagers would often be kept in reserve in intense pitched battles, before being sent out as the vanguard of a second wave of gnolls against the exhausted adversary, with spiked clubs in their hands, daggers between their teeth, and rabid hunger in their hearts. The legacy of their military feats would spread amongst the seven seas, ultimately inspiring the iconic skull and crossbones used by pirates of all races."

Such a piercing cacophony often flows through the desert air, filling the ears of both elves and humans with an eerie dread before the tension is broken by flurries of arrows. Following this deadly barrage, the gnolls emerge from the dunes, cackling loudly before attacking the stragglers in melee combat. This encirclement strategy, combined with such a distinct, piercing battlecry, became infamous in the early years of the Age of Unravelling from the hills of Bulwar to the seas of Rahen."

Throughout the zenith years of the Age of Unravelling, gnolls began to implement complex manoeuvres among their units to effectively fight drilled gunpowder armies. Simple strategic goals were issued from pack commanders to their many lieutenants to carry out however they pleased, with success being rewarded and the prospect of promotions and bonus loot and failure punishable by death (often by kin-cannibalism or ritualistic sacrifice). As a result of this vicious meritocracy, only the most competent and loyal lieutenants remained, who proved to be capable at leading smaller warhosts to outflank, outmanoeuvre, and outsmart the Pack's many enemies at the tactical level."

However, one of its most sought exports was the Cannorian handgonne, which would proliferate throughout the gnollish population for its thundering noise and ease of manufacturing. Gnolls would modify the handgonnes by shortening and widening the barrel, allowing for multiple shots to be stuffed into the gonne to be fired simultaneously. Due to the successful but monstrous brutality of such firearms, human and elven scribes would spitefully dismiss them in their literature to mask their shame and fear of dying to such crude weapons in the hands of gnolls."

Gnolls would develop a pike-and-shot strategy, arming half of their host with matchlocks and the other half with fire-lances with identical face paints to the musketeers. Generals would lead their armies into the pikewalls, deceived by such a simple misdirection, while the wise would send skirmishers to challenge the pikemen, only for them to be scorched by belching flames from the pikemen at close range before being slaughtered. In reality, the dubious quality of such fire-lances often undermined this novel strategy, as the fire-lances were mocked for frequently spreading burning tar, fat, and sulphur within gnollish formations instead."

This was exasperated by increasing restlessness from the slaves as news of the gnolls' defeats in raids became widespread. In a desperate effort to stem the threat of rebellion, and to adapt to the shifting tides of war, gnolls began to offer worthy slaves freedom in exchange for military service. Pressed into slave battalions, these soldiers would be simply drilled to operate “imported” (scavenged, stolen, salvaged) firearms before being integrated into battle-ready packs for future raids. Poor training, supplies, and leadership from their pack mistresses guaranteed that many of these “soldiers” would be condemned to early graves, never laying eyes upon the freedom promised to them."

However, an increasing proliferation of firearms through raiding and enslaved craftsmen capable of spreading the art to their gnollish masters ensured a modest supply of marginally acceptable firearms. In a bastardization of modern Jaddarin drill, gnolls would form into “boomstick lines” and fire an unholy salvo of shrapnel and fire before charging into the fray of the weakened opponents' formations. Though effective against inexperienced levies and garrison troops in the borderlands they raided, the gnolls would often shatter their teeth upon any formation of drilled line infantry and retreat into their homeland."

Many of them had an affinity for magic and were capable of imbuing weapons with demonfire, unquenchable and hungry flames summoned from the depths themselves. When firearms were introduced into the Salahad, shamans were encouraged to bless guns with demonic rituals, allowing their shots to be demonfire conductors. Throughout the Age of the Witchkings, powerful gnollish leaders would equip their most loyal and zealous gnolls with demonic blunderbusses and bullet-resistant plate armour which resembled the scales of ancient dragons.

Goblinfire, an esoteric compound from the ports of Aqatbar, was introduced to the gnolls during the Age of the Witchkings through trade with the Overclan. This black concoction would be funnelled into canisters before being ignited by a slow-burning match, then ejected through an air-powered hose, producing a constant stream of hellish fire. Although such contraptions were too heavy to be used in pitched battle in the Salahedesi, gnollish lieutenants would use these flamespitters in an exhibit of power, intimidating enemy garrisons and rebel holdouts with the threat of painful and slow immolation."

Though many of these creations would manifest through countless mutilated variations of muskets and pistols, some of them returned to form by looking towards the grenade for wisdom. Iron-cast grenades, blessed by the shamans, became the iconic weapon of the Fleshroast Brigades for their devastating power against any material. Projected with specially-crafted staff slings, these grenades could fly hundreds of feet in the air before exploding under the feet of the enemy, butchering and roasting their flesh alive or above their heads, showering them with shrapnel and demonic fireballs. The Fleshroast Brigades would become infamous in the eastern Salahad, as their grenades could hunt and roast any living flesh, from Jaddarin cavalry to harpy skirmishers."

As such, gnollish firearms were often designed for either hunting or guaranteeing that close-quarters-combat would happen, allowing for warriors to immerse themselves in the carnage and bloodshed. One such wretched invention was the volley-gun, a multi barreled flintlock musket which would fire a volley's worth of shots simultaneously, tearing any unfortunate souls apart at close range. Volley-guns would be most renowned in the hands of the Faceblasters, a gnollish mercenary group who were capable of concealing themselves in the sandy dunes for days until suitable prey marched across cluelessly, pulverising the enemy's faces at point-blank."

One such client was the Citrine Dwarves of Seghdihr, who would smuggle hundreds of repeater rifles to Jaddarin gnollish contingents. Admired for their high rate of fire and accurate lethality, gnollish artificers would replicate their design; although these copies would lack the exquisite Dwarven craftsmanship and detail.

Originally designed to hunt large game and to defend raiding ships from oncoming marines, the blunderbuss became a popular weapon-of-choice for its brutal damage and its ability to fire two independent shots before reloading. Gnolls would use these firearms primarily to easily tear open supply carriages, lightly-armoured infantry, and the doors of unfortunate households before seizing the loot and captives; threatening their prey with the wrath of another devastating barrage loaded in the second barrel."

In gnollish military strategy, sappers were often sent first to establish temporary fieldworks and to identify weak points in the enemy fortress; this strategy often resulted in many gnollish sappers cluelessly stepping into kill-zones, being slaughtered by the defenders in the process. By the dawn of the Age of Artificers, gnollish commanders would start issuing sappers with greenflame launchers, heavy flamethrowers that could launch concentrated fireballs at enemy garrisons. Mounted upon fieldworks or even on sandy dunes, gnollish sappers would be able to threaten defenders with immolation from afar, allowing for the gnolls to hypothetically advance without any opposition to fulfil tactical objectives."

Typically made by extracting tar and distilling it with swamp peat, this thick liquid was often used in shamanistic rituals to unleash long-lasting and fiery blazes for religious purposes. As firearms became more complex, the gnolls would apply onekxhur into their modern weaponry, pouring copious amounts of the hellish concoction into rockets. After being fired at the enemy, the onekxhur would ignite and violently spread throughout the battlefield, ripping at the flesh of enemies as their morale quickly crumpled from such a cruel invention-of-war."

In spite of these flaws, the 2-gauge shotgun would be adopted into gnollish military strategy. Gnollish companies would implement pin-and-flank tactics, wherein skirmishers would pin down enemy units with accurate rifle-fire from advantageous terrain to allow the 2-Gauge shotgun crews to flank deep into enemy lines unchecked, firing canister shots to disembowel the pinned enemy units. The skirmishers would then charge forwards, slaughtering the stragglers in melee combat.

Consisting of two canisters filled with greenfire and pressurised air, the flamespitter was operated by squeezing a lever, which would cause the pressurised air to force the greenfire out through a nozzle, spewing a jet of hellish flames up to 15 metres far.

Likewise, gnollish cavalry often consisted of dragoons armed with long-barreled muskets, dressed in the bones of their latest hunts.

While the "shot" part of the pike & shot formation was outlawed in most Ynnic realms, that didn't stop homesteader armies from deploying it, and the Rzentur armies would only cease to use this version of it when they finally passed to all-musket armies."

 ynnic_19_trompolere_rangersDESCR:0 "The Sarda were the first Ynnic people to experience gunpowder warfare in all its destructivity, and this made them pursue more efficient usages of the bow. Levying hunters was no longer considered sufficient, and lords began scheduling drilling sessions in preparation of - or even during - wars. The techniques that arose during these drills, first developed in Trompolere camps, allowed the common troops to loosen three arrows at once - either in multiple directions, or concentrated on the same target."

The final model, known as Adirbor, was a repeating crossbow shooting multiple daggers at high speed. While normally overkill, it proved greatly effective against the Cursed Ones. A company of Brelari crossbows participated to the defense of Amacimst against Cursed Ones besiegers, and, for their remarkable kill-count, they were dubbed "Crossbowmasters of Amacimst" by Lord Gelendirn III."

As legendary as the Companions' fame, are the disparate weapons and armour-pieces they wield, so effective, they are rumored by Cannorians to be Precursor Relics. During the Age of Witch-Kings the Companions were at the apex of their strength, so confident of their power they would slowly march towards the enemy lines, unflinching under musket fire as their magic deflected all projectiles, and when they reached the enemy they would effortlessly cut them all down."

Rilsean Wardens, named after the Sarda word for "Kingdom", were a heterogeneous force of full-time fighters and spellcasters, serving as the middle step between feudal and standing armies. While their choice of weapon varied, they were most commonly outfitted with enchanted spears and shields bearing the coat of arms of their realm, as well as an enchanted mail-and-plate armour."

 ynnic_26_dismounted_ynnic_knightsDESCR:0 "Despite the nobility and prestige associated with their steed, Ynnic Knights were no strangers to fighting on foot. Before stirrups were adopted, most knights would in fact dismount and fight on foot during prolonged battles, and this role became prominent again during the late Age of Witch-Kings, thanks to the inspiration provided by Malacnar Companions. Dismounted Ynnic Knights or "Nohy Vytrie" were those knights who entered the battle already on foot, and they were most commonly last-born sons or lesser nobility, serving as elite infantry to rally the other troops and provide the mainstay of the Ynnic battle line. Donning full body armour and wielding greatswords, they slowly but surely advanced towards the enemy lines, deflecting enemy bullets from a distance. And once they were close enough to see their enemies eye to eye, they would dash towards them right before they could reload."

Nicknamed "Drozmateers" by Cannorian merchants, these warriors were far scarier than their nickname made them out to be, as was the mass fire coming out of their green, dragonscale-like bladed muskets. In the Rzentur's signature combination of savagery and religious zeal, they formed a tactic that had alternating members of the line fire whilst the others charged at the enemy."

Teira battle style is an extension of their lifestyle: small, secretive bands who scrape by while doing their best not to draw attention, but capable, if cornered, to set lethal ambushes against their would-be hunters. Having arrived to the Ynn thanks to a secret pathway through the Forest of the Cursed Ones known only to them, Teira were outfitted with weapons such as crossbows, spears and throwing daggers of a far higher quality than anything they were used to, but even under the service of Ynnic Lords they still continued wearing the same camouflage-painted fur coats their brethren did in Dalaire. This attire favoured their primary task: irregular warfare, skirmishes, ambushes and supply train disruption, providing a response to the frontiermen's own asymmetrical warfare and developing a fame as hunters of men second only to Wendigos. The sight of the Teira's glowing eyes staring at you from the woods was enough to send common troops into a panic."

Discipline was enforced, and the previous Drozmateer tactic of charging at will into enemy lines was abolished; Gospodh Aranthiv deemed it "Improper of a modern army".

 ynnic_30_longbow_knightsDESCR:0 "To Ynnic Knights, the crossbow was seen as a devious device to fabricate strength, the shortbow was the weapon of lowly woodsmen and the composite bow was for bandits. But the longbow? Ynnic Knights admired the Damerian longbow, which required strength and years of training to use. Imported in the nineteenth century, it quickly became one of their favourite tools when out hunting. At the battle of Velencestor in 1811 400 knights fought in the frontline as heavily-armoured foot archers, and their arrows, glowing blue with magic, rained destruction on the enemy musketeer lines by buzzing through several men or exploding upon landing. The future Empress Morvel was leading these archers, having been the one to perfect those magical arrows during her exile in Veykoda. By her campaign's end, the Vytrie Rongukol - Longbow Knights - had grown into a 1000-strong regiment, and more were commissioned during her reign. Veykodan rune magic was applied to both the bows and armour of the knights, with carvings in elegant patterns that enhanced not only the beauty, but also the performance of their equipment. The longbows, with largest surface area of all types of bow, were optimal for rune magic."

True to their factionalist indole, there were two different Tuathak Foreign Legions of which one served the Dragon Dominion, the other the new Sarda Empire. While those of the Dragon Dominion unleashed the power of Eordand's new deadly magirifles, those under the Sarda Empire were infamous for slowly starving their prisoners to death before throwing their bodies into the river, and in battle they wielded poison-laced copper swords similar to Dracball, the sword of Artorean the Dragonslayer, with an obvious message."

And why invest all your money into heavy plate armour for yourself, when you needed mobility in order to acrobatically jump off anyway? Due to their proximity to the ironhouses of Brelar, Dolindhan knights were the first to be able to afford horse armour consistently, and they often overlayed it with cloth in the colour of their suzerain's emblem.

These Draconic Knights were outfitted in a green, Balgaric-style spiked armour that made them betray no emotion, and, as they traced their lineage to the Dragon-God himself through their Rzentur side, their dragon blood allowed them to wield powerful magic: magic that made them impervious to anything short of a cannonball."

Instead, goblins armed with shortbows along major caravan routes laid in wait for oncoming caravans. They would then emerge and fire dozens of arrows into the caravanners, killing them before they could flee or strike back. Eventually, the Greysheeps would also use these highly experienced and surprisingly accurate warriors for battles, where they would earn their name after a small force of 200 goblins with shortbows held a hilltop for 6 hours against thousands of Gelkar soldiers."

Many of Perzuk's volunteers had already retired by then, and their children lacked the ambition of their forefathers. As such, the Marbleheads had to extend the same offer to their human subjects, and though a large amount took it, they only begrudgingly accepted the idea of fighting alongside goblins, who they consider spawns of the Malevolent Dark. Fights, thievery, and murder were common in mixed units, but mixed units were rather effective in battle as the strengths and weaknesses of the humans and goblins complemented each other and showed the potential for continuing such tactics if morale issues could be fixed."

This orange-colored gemstone, found only in Bulwar and surrounding regions, is prized by the Sun Cults, and for good reason. If left under full sunlight for more than six hours, it would shine in the darkness and repel certain undead creatures. However, artificers and priests in the Overclan found that when charged with magical energy, sunstones could be turned into a kind of grenade that would shine with a power akin to the sun for a few moments upon being thrown, turning everything in close proximity into ashes. All Jadd soldiers in the Overclan were issued a couple of charged sunstone gems, but there were specialized units who were issued with vast quantities of sunstone to rain the power of the sun upon the enemy."

The mixture was placed in steel tanks that would launch the volatile sludge using pressurized air and nozzles. The government of the Overclan immediately hired the rogue tinkerers and gave them the funds to set up a production complex. These flamers, as they were called, were issued to only the bravest of soldiers who were called Flame Sappers and given thick armor to protect them from both their weapon and enemy fire, since they had to advance to very close range to use their flamethrowers."

He immediately began reorganizing the regiments under his command to have an equal number of goblins and humans, enforcing a high standard of conduct among his men. He also placed a high amount of importance on firing discipline, forcing both human and goblin soldiers, who previously simply fired whenever their guns were loaded, to coordinate their volleys. When his superiors in Aqatbar saw this, they immediately had Zamuraš appointed as Chief of the Army so that he could spread his methods across the Overclan."

Thus the first iteration of the Sunscorch Handcannon was produced. This highly innovative and extraordinarily dangerous weapon fired a kind of goo, named sunplasm due to its similarity in texture to ectoplasm, which could burn through just about anything. Sunplasm is produced by heating air to very high temperatures with a Damestear crystal, but because it could melt most known alloys, this process was required to happen within the handcannon. This meant that if the process failed in any way, it was the user's life that paid the price."

While nearly all proposals used explosives in some way, one stood out. Proposed by the military engineer Aminkle Picktooth, it consisted of using powerful explosives to artificially create landslides, burying the enemy in tons of rubble and dirt and blocking the passage of reinforcements. This strategy was put to the test during a border skirmish with Ourdians in 1702, where it worked wonderfully, with hundreds of Ourdians buried beneath smoldering rock. Brokenhammer was rewarded richly, and the Landslide Corps was officially established just a few weeks later."

As expected, the inventions that intrigued them the most were Sunplasm and Goblinfire. They meticulously studied these odd weapons, and to the horror of the rest of Bulwar, actually improved them. They combined the flamethrower with Goblinfire and created a terrifyingly powerful flamethrower that shoots Sunplasm by adding magical wards to the nozzle, pipe, and Flame Sapper armor so that it could withstand the heat of a constant stream of sunplasm. They were named False-Suns, after the incredibly destructive power that the weapon released."

It was with the advent of the 19th century that they created the ultimate weapon to harness fire in the form of the appropriately named Sunwielders. These humans and goblins are clad in 2-meters tall Damestear-powered exosuits bristling with weapons. In both hands it holds flaming greatswords and in its wrists are False-Sun flamethrowers. On one of its shoulders there is either a device made of lenses that reflects and magnifies the burning heat of the sun into the enemy, on its other shoulder is a gigantic sunstone cannon which fires chunks of sunstone the size of human heads, capable of annihilating concrete walls. Its faceplate is a blank piece of gilded steel with two eyeholes burning with magefire (which can also be used as a weapon), contrasting with the rest of the mech which is the color of ash and lead. These mechanical avatars of divine wrath are thankfully extremely rare, with just slightly more than a hundred in existence due to the immense amount of money and effort that goes into the creation of just a single one, but when they are deployed, nothing can stop them."

A single immolator could cause unparalleled havoc on the battlefield, and until higher-calibre rounds were developed, were near-invincible in conventional warfare. Unfortunately for the Overclan, their enemies soon learned that, despite being free from conventional logic, the immolator was not immune to the laws of physics, and exerted a massive amount of weight upon the ground it tread.

Traditionally, Teplins went into battle with large shields and a short thrusting sword designed to slip between the plates of lamelar armor.

Equipped with gambeson, spear, and war sickle, Yan levy soldiers were durable, dependable, and stalwart even in the face of enemies such as Harimari, Oni, or Shuuvush raiders.

Though they did not abandon their shields or blades, pikes began to emerge as the primary weapon of the Teplin until first contact with the enemy.

In response to these major shakeups,Yan states began to institute extensive conscription practices, ballooning army sizes.

When armies from Baihon Xinh marched north to subdue the Hinphat in their attempts to reconsolidate the empire, they were met by sulfurous shot and shining shields and pursued by axe-wielding warriors.

At range, this encrusted armor proved to be surprisingly resilient to small arms fire, and enabled Binhrung warriors to close to short range with reduced casualties compared to their foes in Kudet Kai or Sirtan.

Though they were never the best in a straight fight, the Kai were masters of choosing engagements in favorable conditions, which served them well against the Bom and Xia who encroached on their lands."

Tianlou would use their wealth and knowledge to field divisions equipped with the latest in firearms and trained in efficient reloading techniques. Tianlou's free shooters became the first true gunpowder army of Yanshen, promoting the further development of ever more modern warfare."

The arrival of these displaced Xia would lead to meditation and techniques for the cultivation of chi to become a part of the culture of the western Kai. Adapted for military purposes, kai soldiers grew capable of cultivating chi to the point they could produce bursts of flame, send gales of wind, manipulate water and move earth. Naturally the cultivation of these skills led to less proficiency in firearm warfare, but these soldiers served as the elite shock troops across the Kai realms."

 halessi_19_yanshen_smokersDESCR:0 "As the states of Yanshen began to focus on firearm formations, having a clear line of sight for firing lines became essential to warfare. Preventing the required sight lines needed to make these formations effective thus became equally important. Yansheni soldiers began carrying smoke grenades to obstruct the vision of enemy formations, and warfare often involved disrupting one section of the enemy formation with smoke grenades while the smoker formation focused fire on the unobstructed sections of the enemy line."

Their once-dominant faith slowly relegated into ever shrinking jungles, surrounded by hostile powers on all sides, the remaining tribes that remained loyal to the old ways were extremely proficient in guerilla warfare. When the land awakened and the spirits rose once more, however, the tides turned against the enemies of the Mystic Accord.

The key to their success was their Sunrise Legions, modern human divisions using imported Cannorian weapons who were commanded by elves who had spent decades if not centuries studying the art of warfare. While some would think that centuries old elves would have outdated notions of warfare, the military academy in Azkare placed great emphasis on modern tactics and strategy."

The formations adopted by Khebtei Teleni naturally placed a great emphasis on defensive tactics, and harassment, stratagems that served them well in the Bomdan jungles. In addition to their rifles these soldiers would often have an excess of grenades which could be easily lobbed at encroaching armies from behind the safety of the 12-Walls. These tactics were sometimes seen as cowardly by outsiders, but the opinions of those with depleted armies and exhausted populations mattered little to the Lord Mayors of Khabtei Teleni."

Through artifice, the power of a spirit could be siphoned and used to craft magical ammunition and explosives with elemental properties and high armor penetration. The extreme difficulty and cost of producing such weapons, however, meant that a battalion of soldiers would rarely have more than two “Spirit Slingers”, and each spirit-armed soldier would possess no more than a  half-dozen rounds of enhanced armaments. Nonetheless, those divisions armed with spirit-empowered weapons consistently triumphed over those who couldn't or wouldn't exploit the spirits, cementing the use of spirit-enhanced weaponry in Halessi warfare."

Despite this precipitous loss of territory and power, the return of the necropolis spirits that once guarded the city made Bim Lau nearly impregnable. Focused solely on the defense of the Necropolis, the living warriors  of Bim Lau would  fight tirelessly alongside their ancestors to ensure the freedom of the city, knowing that they would rise again to defend the Necropolis should they fall.

Inspired by the quality of Cannorian armaments and the efficient reloading of Cannorian infantry, Baihon Xinh sought to model their army after the Cannorians. They would import and eventually produce Cannorian arms, drill their soldiers according to Cannorian Doctrine and send their generals to Cannor to learn their strategies of war.

The costs of feilding armies equipped with all the experimental equipment one could muster became prohibitive, even for the wealthiest states of Yanshen. This led to the Yansheni adopting standard mass produced rifles and placing more emphasis on military drill and order instead of experimentation.

To combat the great terror birds of the northern riders, the harimari began to embed their crossbowmen within pike formations that could ward off cavalry. The combination of spear and crossbow became known as the “Thousand Splinter Defense” - its proponents noted that the name described the thousands of sharp shafts the enemy would encounter in battle; its detractors stated that few casualties were inflicted on the enemy because of the defensive nature of the formation, and that it was little more painful than a splinter."

If the bird riders refused to give battle and face a Splinter Formation unit, musket fire from arquebusiers embedded in the unit could inflict losses on the Shuuvush from great range, whittling down their numbers and forcing them to quit the field."

Gunpowder fuses were attached to spears and lit to spray shrapnel and blind enemies when the monks closed to attack, whereupon they integrated their classic spear and claw weapons with braces of pistols that could be drawn, fired, and discarded as they cleaved through enemy formations.

Three or four-line deep formations would rotate firing, retreating, and reloading to keep up a constant stream of projectiles to shred enemy formations.

Historically given only to those who had served for 10 years and seen action in at least 3 major battles, the Golden Stripe was considered requisite to advance to the rank of sergeant. While ensuring that these officers were all battle-hardened and experienced, this practice also badly restricted the ranks of field commanders available to eastern harimari units. Changes in military training and education that would culminate in the granting of a ceremonial golden stripe to all new soldiers did away with this cultural restriction and greatly improved the ability of the eastern harimari to field capable officers."

As the Chendhyans did not have the magical knowledge to enchant their armor against bullets,nor the infrastructure to do so on a massive scale, they came up with a different way of using their famed riders. Ditching their heavy armor, the Chendhyan riders would fight in a skirmishing manner, harassing the enemy's supply lines and slowing their advance, softening up their enemy just enough for their infantry to mop up what remained."

The state of Lokemeion, however, realized the potential the Eltibhen possessed in this role after its Kylakas saw a duel between an Eltibhen fisher and a Kheionai hoplite, with the Eltibhen fisher being victorious. Lokemeion recruited the Eltibhen to serve as marines. Armed with a net and a trident, they became known as the Stalia Marines. Their quick movement and tactics involving their nets served them well in the many island campaigns they participated in, with other Kheionai states quickly copying the Stalia Marines and recruiting their own Eltibhen population to serve as marines too."

 bharbhen_26_chendhyan_irregularsDESCR:0 "As the states that bordered the Chendhyan steppe started pushing into the region, many Chendhyans resorted to guerilla warfare to fight off the invaders. The Chendhyan Irregulars made the colonies in the steppe a high-maintenance endeavor, for there always needed to be a strong garrison to stop the colony from being destroyed by Chendhyan war bands. With the collapse of Ameion's empire in the 1700s, they and Clematar's colonies in the Chendhyan Steppe were destroyed by Chendhyan Irregulars, who killed every colonist they could find."

With the death of the famed Chendhyan charges of old, many Chendhyan tribes were left struggling to understand what the place of the mounted Chendhyan warrior should be. The answer came from the Tsidarok tribe, who used their feline mounts to transport its riders to battle and have its riders fight like infantry on foot. Unlike Lion and Shot tactics, however, these Chendhyan Dragoons never fought at close distance, and fell back on  their mounts when the enemy closed in."

A swivel gun would be mounted on a boar, with the Eltibhen rider not only being just a mounted soldier, but also an artilleryman. Soon the Sarkiona Swivel Gun tactic spread among the boar riders, which became very useful in the mountainous and rugged landscape of Alecand. When the Kheionai united into a single league in the 1700s, much of its cavalry force would be made up of this unit."

 kheionai_1_guarded_phalanxDESCR:0 "The phalanx was the predominant military formation used amongst the Kheionai city states for centuries. However, the phalanx was also inherently inflexible and vulnerable to flanking maneuvers; this was a pressing problem for Kheionai polities as their Bharbhen adversaries could easily outmaneuver and encircle phalanxes using their mobile mounts. To address these critical flaws, Kheionai rulers, especially those from Empkeios and Lokemeion, would leverage the economic and political clout of their urban powerbases to convince rural aristocrats to muster skirmishers from their fiefs. Armed with javelins and thrusting spears, these auxiliary skirmishers were deployed to defend and support the phalanx by blocking flanking enemies."

 kheionai_1_pure_phalanxDESCR:0 "The phalanx’s excellence in massed infantry warfare in Alecand left many city states ignorant to its many flaws against mobile military formations. As a result, military strategy developed to optimize the phalanx’s strengths as an indomitable forward-facing formation. The Alecandi Kheionai would concentrate their best soldiers in a dense formation withdrawn from the battlefield, while sending their regular hoplites to push forwards in standard phalanx tactics. As the battle degenerated into an exhausting stalemate, Kheionai generals would concentrate their elite forces in a flanking maneuver, intending to shatter and rout their exhausted enemies. Historians who observed the exclusive use of the phalanx in this strategy by the Kheionai would refer to the formation as the Pure Phalanx."

These armies were predominantly heavily-armored and well-disciplined citizen-soldiers, which formed into phalanxes as was tradition amongst the Kheionai. To counter the  Taychendi elves’ cavalry, Laskaris would maintain reserve hoplites to either drive away these mounted soldiers throughout the battle or, more boldly, proactively intercept these foes and drive away the threat of cavalry charges.\n\nThese audacious tactics, combined with support by local mercenaries and ranged skirmishers, would enable the Ameioni center to continuously push unabated into the outmatched hordes of Taychendi and claim many a battlefield in victory."

 kheionai_5_lokemeioni_phalanxDESCR:0 "The 15th century was unkind to the people of Lokemeion, as Bharbhen raids escalated into full-scale war with the united Eltikhan kingdom. Initial battles led to defeat after defeat as the traditional auxiliary skirmishers that guarded the flanks proved unable to withstand the Bharbhen horde and their wretched boar mounts. Thus the Lokemeioni were forced to adapt to the shifting tides of warfare.  Instead of relying on simple levies, Lokemeion began to recruit sýnaranbhen, veteran soldiers defending the colonies near the Eltikhan, to hold the flanks of the battlefield. Professional and motivated, the sýnaranbhen proved not only capable skirmishers but also able to execute advanced maneuvers with allied phalanxes and effectively dispatching boar rider units."

The exceptional range and accuracy of such weapons would coax the Omami phalanx formations to either retreat or march forwards from the casualties steadily sustained. The Degakheioni phalanxes, which were larger and deeper-ranked than the Ormami phalanxes, would shatter their fatigued enemies on the field of battle with the support of speeding chariots."

 kheionai_6_ameioni_war_chariotsDESCR:0 "For much of their history, the Kheionai lacked any mounts, leading to a battlefield dominated solely by infantry.  This would change, however, when the mighty general, Laskaris the Conqueror, invaded Taychend. With his conquest came, amongst other things, the introduction of horses to the Kheionai through the Ameioni.\n\nThe steeds' potential for battle was quickly recognized by the Ameioni, but the general unfamiliarity with horseback riding rendered heavy cavalry a challenge to implement. Emulating the beasts-of-burden that worked the plows to till their fields, the Ameioni crafted war chariots for the horses to drive through the battlefield. Although these chariots proved to be unwieldy and occasionally unpredictable to operate for the drivers, their mobility on open fields could decisively overcome the virtuous, powerful phalanx. Through a combination of archers safely weakening the formations from the safety of the chariots and the ravaging damage that chariots could cause by running down wavering hoplites after volleys of arrows, the chariots proved to be a powerful tool to counter the phalanx."

The manipule was capable of efficient maneuvering and tactical flexibility which disrupted the stiff battle lines of the Degakheioni phalanxes, hindering the cohesion and discipline vital for their success. Combined with the effective application of heavy cavalry to flank and cause devastating shock damage, the Degakheioni phalanx was humiliated on the battlefield."

 kheionai_9_phocas_phalanxDESCR:0 "After the initial setbacks in the invasion of Oktikheion, Kylakas Phocas of Degaheion would personally intervene to rebuild Degakheion's forces. Plans were drawn to reform the army to leverage heavily-armored hoplites who would gather into dense phalanxes, equipped with javelins and thrusting spears, to overwhelm the Oktikheioni armies on the field. However, before Phocas could assemble his army for a second invasion, he was ousted from office, leaving the Phocas Phalanx as a conceptual battle formation."

 kheionai_10_keyolioni_javelin_ridersDESCR:0 "Amongst the many nékheis that settled in the vast lands of Devand, it was the Keyolíoni that most quickly mastered equestrianism among the Kheionai. With superior cavalry at their disposal, chariots were abandoned, in favor of more mobile, accessible and efficient heavy cavalry. In dense formations, the Keyolíoni would target enemy phalanxes that were pinned by allied formations, battering their unprotected flanks with sharp javelins before charging in with their thrusting swords, dashing and crushing their enemies in the process. Such innovations in mobile cavalry warfare contributed to the rapid decline of the Kheionai phalanx in early-modern warfare as the latter struggled to cope with the increasing intensity of battle."

 kheionai_12_ameioni_fotistrepeiDESCR:0 "Ameion's expansion into Taychend rapidly stagnated following the death of Laskaris the Conqueror. However, the legacy of momentous military reform did not pass away with such a great elf. One such reform was the Fotistrépei system, where Ameioni administrators exchanged land and privileges to Kheionized Taychendi soldiers.\n\nKnown as the Fotistrépei, these soldiers would form a permanent and loyal native force. The Fotistrépei would not only help suppress Taychendi unrest under Ameioni occupation but also revitalize further conquest of Taychend when the Sun Elves arrived in Southern Aelantir and shattered Larankar's empire. Armed with both Cannorian muskets imported by their Kheionai leadership and indigenous weapons such as longbows and javelins, the Fotistrépei would act as light infantry responsible for providing firepower and probing attacks in support of Ameioni phalanxes who would steadily push towards the main enemy force. This, combined with ample heavy cavalry support, were decisive against Taychendi armies who could not adapt against Ameion's dynamic and overwhelming tactics on the battlefield."

 kheionai_12_arpediferi_phalanxDESCR:0 "When the Cannorians arrived on the shores of Arpedifér, the firearm followed them. The traditional way of war of the Kheionai was brought to kneel by the musket, whose bullets could penetrate the shields and armor of the mighty hoplite and shatter the morale and discipline of the phalanx formation in battle. Yet, despite their lethality, firearms could not shake the hardened hearts of the Arpediféri, the venerable pioneers of the phalanx.\n\nTo avoid dishonoring their kheion's most sacred institution, the Arpediféri would pay exorbitant expenses for the finest and strongest armor and equipment to save themselves from bullets, even going as far as consulting mages to render their shields seemingly invulnerable by enchanting them with the same abjurations that have shielded their people from the kaydhano for millenia. Though some would still fall despite their warded armor, others truly became invulnerable on the battlefield, forming the vital core for the Arpediféri army in the early-modern era."

 kheionai_14_oktikheioni_outridersDESCR:0 "When firearms were introduced to the Kheionai, the emerging class of professional cavalry welcomed them with open arms just as they did with equestrianism decades ago, especially those of the Okitkheioni people. Equipping themselves with pistols and foregoing most of their heavy full-body armor to allow greater speed on the battlefield, these equestrians transitioned from heavy cavalry into equally-as-dangerous skirmishers. The Oktikheioni Outriders were renowned for their ability to isolate phalanxes before orbiting their unfortunate enemies in a ring of death, firing as many pistols into them before tactically retreating into friendly forces to reload and repeat the process. These skirmisher cavalry forced the Alecandi Kheionai to either relinquish their traditional phalanx, or be outpaced, outgunned and outmaneuvered on the battlefield."

The mayor would commission the village blacksmith to replicate the muskets, achieving this task after months of labor. Soon after, the musket proliferated throughout the kheion, and its generals openly integrated them into the Besolakí army, reforming their strategies around such powerful weapons.\n\nThe Besolakí Square was a product of the mass introduction of firearms into the army, which was a hollowed formation which could protect arquebusiers as they shot at Bharbhen and rival Kheionai invaders under the safety of disciplined hoplites armed with sarissa and shields. Supported by skirmishers and light cavalry, the Besolakí Square was also capable of safely attacking on the battlefield."

 kheionai_15_degakheioni_pikesDESCR:0 "Degakheion, who was still recovering from the trauma of their defeat in the invasion of Oktikheion, begrudgingly adopted gunpowder into their armies, aware of its power from trade with the Cannorians. As a result of the penetrating power of muskets, Degakheioni hoplites would forgo their shields in favor of longer sarissas, which could steadfastly stand their ground against cavalry and other infantry. Arqubusiers would be deployed in two ranks in between Degakheioni pike squares, firing massed salvos at the enemy continuously as skirmishers before retreating behind the safety of Degakheioni pikemen. While the pikemen fought the cavalry and infantry, the arquebusiers would reposition along the flanks of battle, forming single-rank lines to continue battering the enemy with gunfire."

 kheionai_18_ormami_cuirassiersDESCR:0 "Despite the rapid proliferation of cavalry throughout Kheionai, Ormam maintained a relatively limited cavalry force compared to their neighbors, favoring expenditures towards a modernized infantry-centric force. As a result, professional cavalry became a rarity on the battlefield, only consisting of the military elite and upper-class citizen-soldiers. To protect themselves from the evermore deadly battlefield, these cavalry-elves would equip themselves with heavy curaisses and even armor their expensive horses with abjurated barding. Though the average Ormami cuirassier was slower than their contemporaries, they were relentless and invulnerable the moment they began their devastating shock charges on the battlefield, particularly when Ormami infantry had closed the distance and pinned enemy infantry with Delisian warfare tactics."

It became no surprise that the Kherkans were the first of the Kheionai to arm a majority of its soldiers with flintlock muskets. By the mid-1630s, there was one musketeer for every pike-elf remaining in service. The forward vanguard of the new Kherkan army were the Kherkan Grenadiers, who would fight as skirmishers using long-barreled muskets.\n\nThese Grenadiers would be infamous for throwing salvos of ceramic grenades to provide deadly cover before retreating from advancing enemy formations. The heavy firepower of the grenadiers would provide the trailing Kherkan line infantry with a tactical advantage over the wavering and divided enemy forces before volley fire commenced."

 kheionai_19_doukas_formationDESCR:0 "Kylakas Doukas of Empkeios was elected after a prestigious military career as an officer of the Empkeiosi Army, and would use his newfound political clout to revolutionize warfare in Devand. Inspired by Cannorian military advisors and his own experience as a mercenary in Cannorian armies, Doukas concluded that modern Kheionai formations were too slow, unwieldy and reactive to fight modern battles against the Bharben, and needed to be simplified while avoiding losing firepower.\n\nIn response Doukas ordered that  battalions of soldiers would be divided into smaller and narrower companies to allow for superior movement and more troops to be active on the battlefield; these soldiers would be equipped with flintlock muskets and be issued long plug-bayonets in order to serve a dual role as musketeer and pikeman. Doukas' formations excelled in battle, especially in rough terrain, such as the forests of Devand, where massed infantry formations struggled, in-part due to their superior firepower, maneuverability, and efficiency in battle."

Kylakas Delis, who governed Ormam during the mid-1600s, would take advantage of the kheion's extensive mercantile connections to import thousands of flintlock muskets from friendly kheions to fully equip his soldiers with firearms. These soldiers would be assembled into lines of infantry companies, tasked in closing the distance with the support of skirmishers in order to fire a mass volley of musketry before charging the weakened enemy with bayonets. Combined with the brutal shock charges of cuirassiers, Ormam could decisively and quickly win battles without suffering brutal casualties from prolonged volley fire exchanges."

However, Apikhoxí's people refused to tolerate the horrific suffering of massed warfare upon their kin, even as war crept upon their friends and family.\n\nTo address these concerns and minimize casualties, Apikhoxí's military would develop specialized infantry companies designed to minimize the devastation of musket volleys. Those at the front would be equipped with costly abjurated armor, similar to what the Arpediféri had pioneered, and fire upon the opposing line.  Meanwhile, infantry without this armor would focus on reloading muskets behind safe cover to provide the front-rank soldiers. These freshly-loaded muskets would then be swapped with the spent muskets used by the armored frontline. The result was a devastating semi-constant barrage and lower casualties, if at the cost of less overall firepower."

However, the cavalry charge could not penetrate the dense and mighty forests and as a result, cavalry predominantly was limited to skirmishing and reconnaissance roles. As gunpowder warfare and cavalry doctrine rapidly evolved as the Kheionai were entrenched in deeper conflict against their neighbors and the Cannorians, many of the Devandi Kheionai states adopted mobile carabiniers to defend their roads and coastlines where their dense woods couldn't obstruct enemy armies. These dragoons, referred to as rangers to the Cannorians, were able to harass and disable enemy formations with excellent marksmanship before retreating into the countryside, with the speed and lethality of a kaydhano."

Although certainly apocryphal, it reflected the profound mastery and knowledge that the Eneioni had of their own homeland compared to other peoples. When the Eneioni military leadership noticed the increasing effectiveness of open-order formations upon foreign battlefields, they collectively agreed with little debate to begin reforming the Eneioni army away from the old ways of closed-order formations that the rest of the Kheionai desperately held on to.\n\nThe new Eneioni army birthed from these reforms became one of the greatest of its generation in South Aelantir. Every Eneioni militia was as capable of becoming viciously efficient skirmishers who were masters of maneuvering and utilizing any natural cover successfully, even to the thinnest of shrubs, as they were capable of conventional closed-order formation discipline and bravery under volley-fire."

Sensing weakness, Busilari expeditionaries invaded one of the League's members, Deyeion. Forced to defend Deyeion with no aid, the Kylakas of Deyeion decreed the unpopular act of conscription, forcing all capable males to defend their homeland from the foreign invaders at any cost.\n\nThe conscripts would be consolidated into local militia companies led by veteran Deyeioni officers; these companies were responsible for defending their hometowns and if necessary, rapidly integrating with Deyeion regulars to provide vital manpower for open field battles to drive out the invaders. The flexible system would create hell for the invading Busilari as they were forced to fight through scorched earth, sudden mass infantry assaults, and militant local population. The vicious defense would eventually yield peace for the Deyeioni and secure their independence. However, the extensive conscription and economic devastation would leave Deyeion exhausted for  generations to come."

Going into the late 18th century, the cavalry of the Amgremósi rode on specially-bred horses which were faster and more athletic than their other Devandi counterparts, using their speed to outpace the enemy and easily weave into the flanks of the battlefield; armed with carbines, the Amgremósi were capable of accurately firing while moving and just as competent at reloading on horseback. The Amgremósi would take advantage of their mounted marksmanship and fast mounts to enable their cavalry to serve advanced skirmishing and infiltrating roles in combat, performing admirably against the stubborn and stalwart defense of the Apikhoxí infantry."

By the time the storms subsided, the kheions were cut off from their nékheis, who refused to embrace subservience to their former overlords. The Alecandi kheions' hardships did not end, for Cannorian influence began to seep deeper into the Kheionai's sovereignty and more brazen, going as far as fully vassalizing weaker nékheis through Cannorian institutions such as the Vanbury Guild. As their position became more tenuous, the Alecandi Kheionai federalized into the Kheiós League and as a consequence, united their armies into a single banner. Modernized, motivated and armed with the finest Kherkan weaponry, the Kheiós League was ready to drive out all invaders from Kheionai lands and maintain their independence."

Many of them relied upon massive formations of conscripted infantry to outmuscle their attackers, refusing to concede even a single village. But, the economic and political cost of full conscription became unsustainable for war for the Échate League. As a result their members would begin to devolve military responsibilities to smaller armies of highly trained and motivated skirmishers and light infantry, equipped with the finest rifles and uniforms which could camouflage into the forests and hills of Devand. These smaller armies were designed for territorial defense by creating a high-intensity guerilla war against any invaders to render even basic military operations impossible in home territory by instigating skirmishes, assaulting supply convoys, and raiding regimental camps to break the will of the enemy."

In times of conflict, the slinging skill of the average halfling proved to be mightier than the weapon’s humble appearance may imply, for halfling slingers were not only accurate sharpshooters, but also cunning and evasive ambushers."
 halfling_1_village_militia: "Village Militia"
 halfling_1_village_militiaDESCR: "Many halfling polities did not pursue developing formal armies because of their historical subordination to greater empires, but this did not mean that the halflings allowed invaders to bully them in their home territory. When conflict flows into the borders of a halfling village, its residents will mobilise into local militias, turning their warm communities into stalwart bastions. Every road was to be blockaded, every halfling was to defend and fortify the village’s border, and every morsel of food was to be denied from enemy consumption. Eventually, the exhausted invaders would be forced to detour into rugged terrain and paths, where the village could launch advantageous ambushes against them."
 halfling_1_pony_riders: "Pony Riders"
 halfling_1_pony_ridersDESCR: "Unlike their larger equine cousin, the horse, the pony’s shorter stature, quicker movement and stronger frame enabled it to be the perfect steed for Halflings. However, the ponies’ wily and independent nature made them exceptionally challenging to tame; especially the wilder ones among them. Affluent Halfling lords who could afford maintenance for a string of ponies would train their retainers to fight on-horseback as cavalry. The pony riders’ speed and power made them excellent flankers in open battles where Halfling foot-soldiers struggled to keep pace."
 halfling_5_bushrangers: "Bushrangers"
 halfling_5_bushrangersDESCR: "The Small Fellows adventurers quickly discovered the post-Greentide land of Escann to be savage and untamed beyond their modest expectations, filled with hostile tribes and strange creatures that couldn't be simply ignored. To avoid certain demise, the Small Fellows would establish the Bushrangers’ Guild, which was an organisation consisting of Greentide veteran soldiers that were tasked in defending the fledgling Halfling settlements in Escann. Despite their limited numbers, the Bushrangers proved to be successful, defending the Small Fellows’ territory from orcish raids while improving the effectiveness of local militias through improved leadership and training. The military contributions of the Bushrangers enabled the survival of Newshire."
 halfling_5_grainwardens: "Grainwardens"
 halfling_5_grainwardensDESCR: "The intensity of the Wars of Dominion between the Kingdom of Gawed and the Kingdom of Lorent over control of the Small Country threatened the livelihoods of the native halflings to the point where militarization was no longer a question, but a necessity for their protection. As a result, Halfling city elders commissioned permanent standing units to defend themselves from highwaymen, bandits and roving bands of Lorentish and Gawedi soldiers. Colloquially known as the Grainwardens for their role in defending the farms and granaries of the rural countryside, these salaried soldiers were veterans of the Wars of Dominion who would provide local militias with a core of active patrolling soldiers to support the defence of the Halflings."
 halfling_6_armored_ponies: "Armored Ponies"
 halfling_6_armored_poniesDESCR: "The province of Roysfort, where Halflings were known for their stables of strong Roysfoot Thoroughbreds, would not only grow wealthy from the pony trade to northern Halfling states as they demanded more ponies to meet growing military and economic needs, but would make their own innovations upon Halfling cavalry. By equipping their Thoroughbreds with metal barding, the ponies became resilient against glancing melee blows and ranged fire; this granted Halfling cavalry greater durability and staying power in the battlefield."
 halfling_9_ankleshankers: "Ankleshankers"
 halfling_9_ankleshankersDESCR: "When Halfling armies transitioned out of their traditionally defensive warfare, the Ankleshankers were a Greymill evolution of the typical halfing guerilla which exchanged safe ranged skirmishing for audacious close-quarters combat. These halflings would stealthily close the distance upon an unsuspecting enemy before causing terror by shanking their ankles with dirks after sneaking between their ranks. Their legacy would be remembered through the story of Albert Flourmaker, a local hero who waited for days in a captured Gawedi grainstore, along with 24 guerillas, before ambushing the garrison in the cover of dusk. Flourmaker and his allies’ bold action drove away the Lorentish garrison from their own encampment despite their odds. "
 halfling_9_guerilla_bands: "Guerilla Bands"
 halfling_9_guerilla_bandsDESCR: "The village militia became more sophisticated as the Halflings got engulfed in ever-more devastating Cannorian wars as manpower, quality, and equipment steadily improved. Many Halfling villages would appoint standing militia leadership, record and maintain permanent stocks of equipment and even keep census numbers to ensure every capable Halfling could be trained, supplied and deployed for the long-term defence of their community. These militias had superior leadership, initiative and staying power than the ad-hoc local defence units that preceded them."
 halfling_10_pony_knights: "Pony Knights"
 halfling_10_pony_knightsDESCR: "As the Wars of Dominion escalated between Gawed and Lorent, Viswall would emulate their Lorentish overlords’ cavalry. Combining the Halfling pony’s strength and mobility with the robust plate armour of Lorentish blacksmiths, these pony knights provided Halfling armies with  competitive, albeit limited, shock cavalry that was most useful in open battles, where Halfling contingents were often forced to fight under disadvantageous terms against their mightier enemies."
 halfling_12_newshire_village_patrols: "Newshire Village Patrols"
 halfling_12_newshire_village_patrolsDESCR: "The Newshire Village Patrols refer to the local units of the Newshire Army during the Age of Unravelling. As adventurer groups consolidated into independent polities and orcish raids became more dangerous, the need for a standing army was forced upon the Newshire Halflings. The Stewards of Newshire would agree to levy taxes for the foundation of a new army, combining the roles of village militias and the Bushrangers’ Guild into the Newshire Army’s Village Patrols, tasked in defending the homeland from potential invaders. When raids were detected from their daily patrols on the trails of Newshire, nearby units could rapidly consolidate into a defensive army to launch a counterattack upon the potential invaders."
 halfling_12_redfoot_musketeers: "Redfoot Musketeers"
 halfling_12_redfoot_musketeersDESCR: "As the Wars of Dominion dragged on, the Redfoot settlement of Coppertown became a local armaments production centre due to their expertise in metallurgy and craftsmanship. Through the expansion of local armouries and smithing sites, Coppertown’s many blacksmiths became equally-capable gunsmiths. The Coppertowner muskets would become the favourite of Redfoot skirmishers for their stopping power and lethality. Musketry would usurp slinging as the primary ranged weapon of halflings by the end of the War by all but the most frugal of their militias."
 halfling_14_pony_pistoliers: "Pony Pistoliers"
 halfling_14_pony_pistoliersDESCR: "During the early stages of the Small Country revolt, Halfling rangers struggled to deal with the encroaching Lorentish armies invading their homelands; thousands of raids and attacks were reported yet there were only so many to heed their people’s calls for help. Halfling rangers would adopt horseback riding to gain indispensable speed to track and intercept marching Lorentish convoys and regiments. When intercepting an enemy unit, these rangers would allow local militias to prevent the Lorentish units from advancing by any means necessary while they outmanoeuvred the enemy to block their retreat and constrict their positions, firing their pistols at both rearguard and retreating Lorentish soldiers."
 halfling_15_halfling_irregulars: "Halfling Irregulars"
 halfling_15_halfling_irregularsDESCR: "The Small Country Revolt swept across the region against their Lorentish overlords and in the process, the idea of independence resonated throughout the halflings who could hear the Small Country’s heed for help. The dream of a sovereign Small Country drove many Halflings throughout Cannor to join such an ambitious cause as soldiers, responsible for not only seizing Lorentish fortresses and armouries, but fighting in thousands of skirmishes, ambushes and battles. By the end of the Small Country Revolt, halfling chroniclers estimated that one out of every five halflings had a relative or family member who volunteered in the Small Country’s many militias."
 halfling_15_volley_revolutionaries: "Warheart Infantry"
 halfling_15_volley_revolutionariesDESCR: "The Small Country Revolt proved that independence couldn’t be simply won with defensive action alone. Ottokar Warheart, an experienced commander and former adventurer from Pearview, would reorganise his personal army into an aggressive expeditionary force to fulfil this dire need. Warheart’s Halflings would be led deep in enemy territory and attack encampments, supply trains and even entire Lorentish formations at night. These raids emphasised an initial salvo of devastating musket-fire before prolonged skirmishing that applied superior marksmanship and positioning. The daredevil nature of these attacks shattered the resolve of exhausted Lorentish armies, securing victories battle after battle."
 halfling_18_pony_cuirassiers: "Pony Cuirassiers"
 halfling_18_pony_cuirassiersDESCR: "Inspired by the legacy of Halfling rangers serving as pistoliers in the Small Country Revolt, the Cowskeep would raise heavy cavalry in the veneration and innovation of these heroes. Channelling the spirit of the Cowskeep Battlebull, their beloved and pugilist war mount, Cowskeep cuirassiers were renowned for their bold shock charges, regardless of the risk. The cuirassiers would launch aggressive charges against enemy formations regardless if they were distracted by skirmishers, shattering their rank-and-files with sabres like bulls’ horns before the bellowing of blunderbusses and pistols resonated in the air. By the end of such a vicious brawl, the enemy would either rout in complete terror or be pounded into the dirt of the battlefield."
 halfling_19_longmusket_snipers: "Longmusket Snipers"
 halfling_19_longmusket_snipersDESCR: "The long-musket was a rarity within the average armoury due to its hefty and non-standardized components rendering production difficult and their deployment for conventional skirmishing even more challenging. As a result, many of these long-muskets would circulate into the hands of Elkmarcher halflings, who were exceptional woodsmen and hunters, to serve as snipers. These snipers awaited to intercept high-value targets that were expected to cross their area of operation, concealing themselves in lush nature in dugouts for days until their objectives were fulfilled. Notably, their endurance and patience has led some to believe that Elkmarcher snipers could last days in static positions unwaveringly, only resting to periodically chew on robust Elkmarch deer jerky to pass the dragging time."
 halfling_19_stake_squares: "Stake Squares"
 halfling_19_stake_squaresDESCR: "The stature of a Halfling guaranteed that any conventional pikemen would be impossible to employ. Given the increased pressure on the Small Country to militarise to offensively compete with their tense neighbours, the Small Country integrated sappers into their regular musketeer units to provide support in direct action. These sappers were raised to efficiently deploy fieldworks and various traps to weaken the advancing armies while hidden in the midst of the battlefield thanks to the terrain and smoke. The sappers would be best known for their utilisation of stakes as a replacement to pikemen, which could be easily deployed in squares to divert enemies into artificial chokepoints, where Halfling musketeers could easily shoot the disorganised enemy."
 halfling_23_barrage_line: "Barrage Line"
 halfling_23_barrage_lineDESCR: "As volley-fire became the predominant method of musketry throughout Halann, Halflings eventually transitioned their forces to adhere and respect volley-fire strategies. However, strategists also understood that halfling armies struggled in open territory. The Small Country would develop small companies of light infantry that could easily adapt drilled volley-fire and open order formations in the midst of dense forest cover. These light infantry companies fought in two ranks, launching barrages of concentrated musket fire to end skirmishes decisively and quickly before their positions could be compromised and attacked by the recovering enemy."
 halfling_23_west_tipney_rangers: "West Tipney Rangers"
 halfling_23_west_tipney_rangersDESCR: "Although Halflings of West Tipney exalted the sereneness of their humble territory, those claims were frequently challenged by their belligerent neighbours, both Cannorian and Ynnic. As a result, the West Tipney Rangers were founded as a means of expelling rival frontiersmen, tribes, and colonists that were encroaching upon their new homeland. Donning green coats to mask themselves amongst the forests and grasslands of their lands, these rangers fought with rifled muskets against potential invaders, who often prowled open grasslands and the many roads of West Tipney, looking for rightfully West Tipneyean lands to seize for themselves."
 halfling_23_war_dog_riders: "War Dog Riders"
 halfling_23_war_dog_ridersDESCR: "The Vyzemby-Cannor trade introduced war dogs to the Small Country; agile, strong, and cheaper than ponies. Halflings would raise packs of war dogs as mounts, utilising them in scouting and skirmishing roles within their cavalry units. Halfling war dog riders would use their mounts’ speed and strong senses to quickly survey areas ahead of the main army. When necessary, war dog riders would charge into the fray, using their mounts’ strength and vicious bite to rip apart their enemies."
 halfling_26_mobile_skirmishers: "Mobile Skirmishers"
 halfling_26_mobile_skirmishersDESCR: "As deployed firepower escalated due to advancements in artificery, artillery and musketry, halflings rejected any notion of closed-ordered formations, instead staunchly favouring open-order warfare and attrition warfare. Halflings reduced the grandiose numbers of their armies in favour of a strong core of skirmishers and rangers, who would engage the enemy indirectly: supply trains disappeared, entire regiments returned to headquarters battered, and the will of the enemy slowly deteriorated through their attacks. In battle, these skirmishers would fight in open order, with the main bulk of their forces pinning down formations as allied troops engulfed and crushed them like apples being processed into Appleton cider."
 halfling_26_treacherous_tagteams: "Treacherous Tagteams"
 halfling_26_treacherous_tagteamsDESCR: "In close quarters combat, Halflings tended to struggle due to their smaller stature rendering the use of weapons, such as polearms, ineffective. As weapons became more compact and efficient during the Age of Artificers, the Halflings’ quiet pace and short height became more of an advantage in open order combat. Such concepts culminated in the strategies proposed by Thomsbridger General Brandon Shadowfoot written in his military theory book, “Halfling Warfare in the post-Artificery Battlefield.” Stipulated in his book, pairs of infantry would be armed with pistols and dirks for close-quarters combat. from point-blank range initiating Tagteams would sow chaos through their ambush while the other squads attacked gaps in the opponent’s formation, allowing the Tagteams to defeat the enemy in detail."
 halfling_28_small_grenadiers: "Small Grenadiers"
 halfling_28_small_grenadiersDESCR: "Grenades were an uncommon weapon in the Small Country until goblin artificers from Gerudia began to make their way to Viswall, introducing E++ explosives to Small Country armourers. Combining the traditional affinity for halfling slinging and the devastating power of this new substance, the Small Country’s Grenadiers were established. These troops would use their slinging strength to launch E++ bombs behind the safety of allied skirmishers who kept the enemy pinned and distracted, causing severe casualties as the bombs’ payloads spewed devastating fire upon their victims."
 halfling_28_viswall_fencibles: "Viswall Fencibles"
 halfling_28_viswall_fenciblesDESCR: "By the later years of the Age of Artificery, the Small Country would reimplement widespread conscription to compensate for the army’s entanglement in Cannorian affairs. These state-managed militias, known as the Viswall Fencibles because conscription offices were located in Viswall, provided resistance against potential invaders where the standing army could not while providing them the training, financing and equipping a modern army needed. Although not as skilled in warfare as the professional regulars, the Fencibles could afford the professional army lots of time to mobilise and intercept enemy armies through an intense guerilla campaign, bent on crippling the invader’s war effort at every angle."
 halfling_28_dogoons: "Dogoons"
 halfling_28_dogoonsDESCR: "The war dog’s discipline and obedience was unmatched compared to typical Cannorian steeds; no gunfire, artillery or magic-slinging could break the senses and will of the Vyzemby wardog. As a result, it was no surprise that halfings quickly adopted them as war mounts perfect for their stature and cost. Harnessed onto the backs of these dogs, dogoons would use mounted musketry, allowing their dogs to autonomously guide them to safety after each shot during these skirmishes. Should the enemy greedily chase after the dogoons, the war dogs would viciously attack the chaotic ranks of the advancing enemy while the riders warded bayonets away from their trusted companions with sabres."
 halfling_30_shotgunners: "Scattergunners"
 halfling_30_shotgunnersDESCR: "The Cannorian scattergun was invented by the Ashsinger’s Guild of Tinkering and Weaponsmithing in Turnwell as an all-in-one tool for self-defence, hunting, vermin exterminating and excessive noise-making. Featuring a breech-loading bolt-action, the Cannorian scattergun was a simple weapon to operate effectively for any simple-minded soldier. The Small Country would adopt and produce scatterguns for national defence purposes, equipping every Fencible regiment with two platoons of scattergunners to serve as point-guard units and shock troops in close-quarters engagements."
 halfling_30_windgunners: "Windgunners"
 halfling_30_windgunnersDESCR: "The windgun was invented by gnomish tinkerers in Viswall, and was soon adopted as part of the overarching strategy of Halfling warfare in the Small Country. Despite its issues with reliability, maintenance and power, the windgun’s softer report and lack of muzzle flash was excellent for the Halflings’ reliance on guerilla warfare. Windgunners would be deployed to take meeting engagements with the enemy, constantly firing and repositioning to take advantage of the windgun’s staying power before retreating once their air canisters depleted, protected by reinforcements who would attack the weary enemy formations with conventional muskets."

 east_sarhaly_30_melaktewagDESCR:0 "Among the Melakmengi army at the turn of the 19th century, the elite Melaktewag stood above the rest in strength, cunning, and sheer unbreakable will. Initiation required killing a captured troll in single combat, granting the victor the right to wear the intimidating mask and angelic-inspired armor of the order. The pain of gunfire seems a stranger to these soldiers, who march steadily on brandishing crescent blades towards their enemies. Some conspiracy theorists even suggest that the Melaktewag were fallen servers raised by the foul magics of the shadow swamp, but compelled by their loyalty to the living and served even in death."

 harafic_1_desert_warriors: "Desert Warriors"
 harafic_1_desert_warriorsDESCR:0 "The traditional warriors of the desert-dwelling Haraf'ne are well practiced with both spear & bow. In the ancient days of the Haraf'ne, the eastern tribes were consolidated by the eldest of all Houses, House Datai'tsel, who utilized their overwhelming massed archers to force a surrender of many lesser tribes - on some occasions, before a single arrow needed to be loosed."
 harafic_1_jungle_warriors: "Jungle Warriors"
 harafic_1_jungle_warriorsDESCR:0 "The warriors of the Kooras, armed with javelins and bucklers, are expert ambushers in their jungle homes, leaving little chance for resistance with their swift maneuvers. These warriors would often wait, submerged in dark river crossings, for enemy warriors to pass, springing a devastating trap and leaving only a bloodstained current in their wake."
 harafic_1_masked_warriors: "Masked Warriors"
 harafic_1_masked_warriorsDESCR:0 "The masked fighters of the Mayte prefer a more intimate style of warfare compared to the Haraf'ne's arrows and Kooras' javelins and are expert wrestlers and grapplers. Every defeated combatant proves the strength of a Mayte and the power of their Kalun Mask, bringing them one step closer to the King Mask. This results in a tenacity and ferocity unmatched amongst the Harafic ruinborn, and their battles are often to the very last."
 harafic_1_harafe_nomads: "Haraf'ne Nomads"
 harafic_1_harafe_nomadsDESCR:0 "The Haraf'ne's history as a semi-nomadic people translates itself well to their reliance and ability of horse riding. Of particular pride is the Nean'àuvulin, who, in countless battles over the centuries since their inception, have utilized their maneuverability and mastery of the bow to serve as a harassing and screening force, giving their unmounted comrades ample opportunity to shower the enemy with hails of arrows."
 harafic_1_epednar_mercenaries: "Epednar Mercenaries"
 harafic_1_epednar_mercenariesDESCR:0 "In the last few centuries since Hubinach's ultimately failed invasion of the Ynn, many Epednar were exposed to the relative bounty of the river and its people. As veterans and new warriors of the Epednar sought to make a living from raiding and combat, many realized they could sell their service as mercenaries to the many feuding Ynnics after the empire's dissolution - the Epednar's immense prowess as cavalry troops proving decisive in many battles in the Ynn River Valley."
 harafic_9_harafe_herd_guard: "Haraf'ne Herd-Guard"
 harafic_9_harafe_herd_guardDESCR:0 "Shepherds-turned-soldiers were often all the Haraf'ne could call upon in defense for much of their history, outside of the chiefs' retinues, especially in such a vast area as Haraf where scant few local garrisons were all that could be mustered against hostile raids. This necessitated every Haraf'ne herder to be trained in archery and basic defensive tactics, forming an informal "Herd-Guard" that was ever-vigilant in protecting their people and way of life."
 harafic_9_kooras_cutters: "Kooras Cutters"
 harafic_9_kooras_cuttersDESCR:0 "The Kooras are quite adept at navigating their jungle homes; where old, familiar trails may be compromised by a hostile force or dangerous predator, Kooras have no qualms in creating new paths to ambush said enemies. To facilitate this, teams of warriors are equipped with heavy-duty machetes to cut paths through thick jungle and flesh alike."
 harafic_10_epednar_raiders: "Epednar Raiders"
 harafic_10_epednar_raidersDESCR:0 "The bane of the western Ynn was that of the Epednar raiding party; a horde of swift horse archers whose combination of unorthodox tactics and mastery of horseback combat arguably made them the most effective, and most certainly dreaded, horsemen of all North Aelantir."
 harafic_12_silent_stalkers: "Silent Stalkers"
 harafic_12_silent_stalkersDESCR:0 "Of most Haraf'ne, there is a deep-seated fear of the Silent Watchers, beings believed to steal a Haraf'ne's spirit and prevent them from merging with the Paragon Spirits in death. In extreme circumstances, some Haraf'ne may volunteer to become "Silent Stalkers" - fanatical warriors that forfeit their bodies and spirits, and are ceremonially exiled from the tribe in order to cull the Silent Watcher threat to their people. To volunteer is considered the most selfless honor and greatest sacrifice a Haraf'ne may make. Therefore, they are some of the few permitted to wear the dyed sands of Ek'elas, a privilege afforded only to the greatest guardians of the Haraf'ne."
 harafic_12_leptone_gunners: "Leptone Gunners"
 harafic_12_leptone_gunnersDESCR:0 "The arrival of the smallfolk artificers heralded with them the advent of gunpowder weaponry throughout Haraf's ruinborn tribes. Among these tribes were the Leptone, the first of all tribes to establish contact with the smallfolk, and an early adopter of firearms into their tactics. Many a Leptone foe had been brought low after mistaking their guns for clubs or walking sticks, and foolishly charging into their waiting gunners' volleys."
 harafic_14_sandstorm_riders: "Sandstorm Riders"
 harafic_14_sandstorm_ridersDESCR:0 "Haraf'ne mages, in response to the use of firearms against their armies, repurposed the ceremonial use of sandstorm summoning as a battlefield tactic. When battle commenced against a superior foe, a Haraf'ne mage would ride into battle with the Nean'àuvulin, channeling into existence a blistering sandstorm that the cavalry would ride in the eye of, blinding and irritating enemy gunners as the sandstorm riders emerged to cut them down."

 harafic_15_smoker_bandsDESCR:0 "As arquebuses and muskets gained popularity throughout Haraf, the Haraf'ne Ruinborn realized that they could no longer strictly rely on their old tactics of dominating their foes at range in oppressive volleys of arrows. To counteract this, the Haraf'ne repurposed their thick smoke used to block the gaze of Silent Watchers to new effect. Walls of smoke littering the battlefield gave Haraf'ne archers free movement and allowed the whittling harassment of an enemy force before delivering a devastating, final charge."
 harafic_15_mayte_unbreakables: "Mayte Unbreakables"
 harafic_15_mayte_unbreakablesDESCR:0 "As the Mayte came under duress from constant Cannorian incursions, and Mayte strength and valor could no longer compete with their overwhelming firepower, many Mayte warriors grew disillusioned and opted to sell themselves as mercenaries. These bands of Mayte were extremely sought after for their ferocity and bravery, and their access to Cannorian weapons made them ever more deadly foes. Their unwavering spirits and unmatched bravery have garnered for them a nickname among their non-Mayte fellow troops as "Unbreakables"."
 harafic_18_epednar_veterans: "Epednar Veterans"
 harafic_18_epednar_veteransDESCR:0 "With the arrival of Cannorian settlers in the Epednan Expanse, many Epednar were displaced. The Epednar by and large sought to defend their ancient lands by whatever means necessary: raiding weapons depots, attacking undefended settlements, or laying waste to caravans. No tactic was too bloody or profane to use against the trespassers, and although the Epednar's lands would eventually become overwhelmed by multiple wars against the settlers, the zeal and resourcefulness in which the Epednar resisted is still attested to in the present day."
 harafic_19_chiefs_own: "Chief's Own"
 harafic_19_chiefs_ownDESCR:0 "During the period of centralization of the Kinah Federation under House Alas'gasidi, many old rights guaranteed to the other Houses were gradually reduced or revoked. In return for accepting centralization of power in their hands, Alas'gasidi rulers would often grant a sum of currency or resources to the other House Chiefs, and even "compromise rights". One such "compromise right" was the right to field a personal army, but of a size equal to or less than one-fifth the sum of the greater federation's army. Due to the size limitation of such retinues, each House Chief took great care in the drilling and maintenance of its soldiers and sought out the latest Triarchy technologies to equip them."
 harafic_19_benter_gunclubs: "Benter Gunclubs"
 harafic_19_benter_gunclubsDESCR:0 "While the Mayte employ brute strength and bravery in their tactics, the Benter instead employ guile and trickery. This is evident in the development of the Benter's gunclubs, meticulously crafted staves treated with an artificery process that enhances the blunt strikes of the weapons, and also delivers devastating gunshots. On the field of battle, many enemies of the Benter would fall under the false assumption that all they must fear is a simple club, realizing much too late that their underestimation of the Benter would be their last."
 harafic_23_harafe_ambushers: "Haraf'ne Loyals"
 harafic_23_harafe_ambushersDESCR:0 "In the early to mid-1600's, Haraf underwent a rapid consolidation as the Haraf'ne Houses of Alas'gasidi and Leeti'haàt became the opposing, de facto heads of political power within the Kinah Federation. The Alas'gasidi, who desperately clung to the reins of power against the surging popularity of republicanism, founded a new army, the "First Haraf'ne Loyals". This army was formed under the pretense of defending against insurrectionist threats to the Kinah Federation and its officers were specifically selected for their zealous allegiance to the ruling Alas'gasidi. However, many would argue that its true purpose was to intimidate and suppress the people's demands of a republican Haraf, and represented a decaying symbol of outdated monarchist authority."
 harafic_23_wiichanen_auxiliaries: "Wiichanen Auxiliaries"
 harafic_23_wiichanen_auxiliariesDESCR:0 "As intermingling between the Kooras and Triarchy became ever more prevalent, many Kooras soldiers offered themselves as auxiliaries to the Triarchy's armies. When these soldiers returned from their tours of duty, they would often share their newfound expertise with their people. They were responsible for the constant evolution of modern Kooras warfare and became excellent military leaders, combining the swift ambush tactics of the Kooras with the clever inventions of the Triarchy artificers."
 harafic_23_harafe_skirmishers: "Haraf'ne Skirmishers"
 harafic_23_harafe_skirmishersDESCR:0 "Although the Haraf'ne were loath to discard their ancestral weapons, the growing effectiveness of manufactured small arms and steel weapons introduced by Minarian and Triarchy settlers could not be ignored. Adapting to the rapidly shifting state of warfare, the Haraf'ne traded for many of these weapons and reorganized the Nean'àuvulin skirmishers into more modern, effective units capable of merging old magics, new artificery, and Cannorian military thought into a superior version of these blended tactics and strategies."
 harafic_26_dohons_elites: "Elkaiyah Elites"
 harafic_26_dohons_elitesDESCR:0 "Brought about by a reluctant allowance of a popular vote, a new, republican Haraf was born in 1731. Although a majority of citizens wished for such a reformed state, the vote was uncomfortably close. In fear of a growing reactionary front, the new republican administration exercised emergency powers to found the "Elkaiyah'ne Silaor" or "Republic's Army", an elite force of soldiers whose purpose was to defend the republic and its ideals. In its history, it took part in many battles against reactionary revolts, many of whom were veterans of the old, monarchist armies. Finally, in 1765, the last of the revolts were quashed, and the Elkaiyah'ne Silaor was soon after officially disbanded and merged into the republic's regular armies."
 harafic_26_jungle_guerillas: "Kooras Riverbound"
 harafic_26_jungle_guerillasDESCR:0 "With the continued advancement of Kooras-Triarchy cooperation, new artificer inventions to enhance the Kooras' already expert marine and guerilla tactics were pioneered. Waterproof firearms, magi-grow rafts, and hydrophobic field generators all contributed to the unchallengeable status of the Kooras as masters in harassment tactics in their river-abundant, jungle homes."
 harafic_28_harafe_carbines: "Haraf'ne Carbines"
 harafic_28_harafe_carbinesDESCR:0 "Elaborating on the successes found by their cavalry in the use of firearms, the Haraf'ne sought to improve even further on their design by developing their own carbines. Haraf'ne carbines were exceptionally reliable in the desert landscape where the coarse sands would often cause regular firearms to jam or misfire. The relatively cheap production of these carbines and plentiful horses of the 'ne' would allow the founding of many dragoon regiments that fulfilled both policing and military roles for many years."
 harafic_30_nefnad_company: "Naspa'k'aii Company"
 harafic_30_nefnad_companyDESCR:0 "Taking inspiration from the Ynnic Ruinborn's old enchanted bows and a hefty amount of artificer prototyping, the Haraf'ne were able to produce a relatively expensive yet competitive spin on the ancient bow and arrow. The "Naspa'k'aii", as it was known, was a projectile-launching mechanism in the form of a bow which allowed a single soldier to insert into its drawstring a small, round, metal ball (including anti-personnel, anti-magic, and explosive projectiles) that could then be shot at supersonic speeds towards its target. Although limited in use by its rapid consumption of damestear and expensive production, companies armed with these accurate, devastating weapons often broke an enemy line in their first volley and served as excellent skirmishers."
 harafic_30_clan_artificers: "Clan Artificers"
 harafic_30_clan_artificersDESCR:0 "Reaching ever greater heights of artificery's impact and accessibility in warfare, the Kooras had traded for and adopted the latest and greatest inventions from the Triarchy. Sparkdrive weaponry and personal shield generators were staples, and the Kooras had even invented for themselves the "aquatic light refractor"; a remarkably efficient invention that allowed entire platoons of troops to be invisible underwater (and partially so on land), greater freedom in surprise tactics, and partisan attacks."

At first, these weapons were disfavored by the Dakinshi generals due to their inaccuracy coinciding with the quicker mobility by the therianthrope.  However, their ease of use compared to that of a bow and the intimidation the long noise provided led to coastal cities utilizing the weaponry for guards and civilian militia."

They began to clash with their fiercest warriors in single combat, not too dissimilar to the chivalric kingdoms of Escann.

The introduction of the musket changed all this, as the longer range and heavier shot opened a niche on the battlefield.  New columns of units would form a front rank on approach of an opposing army, fire four volleys of shots, then quickly retreat to the back line for the melee warriors to charge.

The payoff to this change was noticeable on the battlefield;  As the earth rumbles, and the muskets in our enemy’s hands quivered in fear, they all began to panic from the crackle of explosive gunpowder, ringing in their ears.  It is the last sound they ever heard."

These bands would claim their ancestry to either a renowned tribe or warrior lodge of old, and travel across Sarhal in order to find where their services were needed."
 tanizu_26_timberland_vanguard:0 "Timberland Vanguard"
 tanizu_26_timberland_vanguardDESCR:0 "The Timberland Vanguard originated from a set of army logistics and programs that focussed on the creation of a permanent army for the Bwa Dakinshi.  The standardization of the musket, the uniform, and the munitions allowed the nation to conscript all able-bodied citizens ”and get them their respective gear for combat."
 tanizu_28_the_sky_headed_omens:0 "The Sky-Headed Omens"
 tanizu_28_the_sky_headed_omensDESCR:0 "One of the last examples of an elite military unit made up solely of Therianthrope, these soldiers were called ‘Sky-Headed’ due to the war sigils tattooed onto their forearms and face, a distinct mark in a modern battlefield.  These soldiers' job was simple;  To cause as much chaos on the battlefield as humanly possible.  Omens would appear shortly after a battle descended into a melee, and what happened after is known only to the Sky-Headed Omens themselves."
 tanizu_30_beastblood_faithful:0 "Beastblood Faithful"
 tanizu_30_beastblood_faithfulDESCR:0 "The introduction to artificery in Sarhal gave way to new tools of warfare.  In the Tanizuland, shamans and artificers competed in order to make more works of magic that grant the average soldier bestial athletics, such as a leopard’s speed or an elephant’s skin. This constant evolution in the Tanizutide’s warfare made it difficult for outsiders to create counter-strategies against them.  In a way, it mimicked the Plants from Heaven’s cunning against the Great Divine— Foreigners possessed an inflexible concept about war, but we possessed both the Beast’s prowess and the Plant’s wisdom."
 tanizu_30_iginu_marchers:0 "Iginu Marchers"
 tanizu_30_iginu_marchersDESCR:0 "Seeing a Therianthrope anywhere outside of an officer’s role has become a rare sight.  Large contingents of soldiers form rank-and-file battalions, called Gitoyagabo, which mimicked the formations of the Cannorians at the time period."

 centaur_6_taryean_ordsiwyn: "Taryean Ordsiwyn"
 centaur_6_taryean_ordsiwynDESCR: "Made up of the strongest and bravest centaurs, the Thunder Hordes lead the clan into battle, breaking the lines of their enemies and allowing the rest of the troop to hunt down those that remain."
 centaur_6_gaohernlangh: "Gaóhernlangh"
 centaur_6_gaohernlanghDESCR: "While a spear is perfectly capable of killing a human, it takes a much stronger weapon to bring down a Centaur. When an honorable charge is not an option, a massive Gaóhernlangh great sword can resolve an up close fight in one slice."
 centaur_10_khivlait_warriors: "Khivlait Warriors"
 centaur_10_khivlait_warriorsDESCR: "Confronted with Federation expansion into the plains with the use of bombs and firearms, the centaurs have started to armor their champions in iron armor scavenged from fallen Triunic warriors."
 centaur_10_langh_and_schemba: "Langh And Schemba"
 centaur_10_langh_and_schembaDESCR: "While a Gaóhernlangh takes training to utilize, using it alongside a shield is something that only the mightiest Centaurs can accomplish. This show of strength enables a warrior to defend themselves while preparing a devastating strike."
 centaur_14_armored_chargers: "Armored Chargers"
 centaur_14_armored_chargersDESCR: "While the great size of a Centaur provides strength, it also leaves them vulnerable to attack. Borrowing designs from mounted opponents, a charger clad in metal can both protect themselves from incoming attacks and carry more momentum into their charge."
 centaur_14_schembai_chargers: "Schembai Chargers"
 centaur_14_schembai_chargersDESCR: "As they continue to be pushed back by the guns of the Federation, the hordes start arming themselves with massive tower shields to protect themselves while they attempt to close in for melee combat. Centaurs too weak to wield the shields rain arrows upon the enemy from behind the charge."
 centaur_18_eynukhe_swarm: "Eynükhe Swarm"
 centaur_18_eynukhe_swarmDESCR: "Armed with smaller shields for increased mobility, the Eynükhes gather in great masses to use their shields, numbers, and agility to avoid Triunic firepower long enough for at least part of the horde to get close enough to attack with their sabers."
 centaur_18_dunnenh_outriders: "Dunnenh Outriders"
 centaur_18_dunnenh_outridersDESCR: "The former archers of the Schembai charge, the Dunnenh arm themselves with multiple pistols seized from battles with Federation colonists. Rather than using the usual mass charge tactic of the centaurs, the Dunnenh only get close enough to open fire with their pistols, grabbing a new one from their belts rather than reload to keep up their rate of fire. When all their pistols are unloaded they run back into the plains to rearm before turning back for another attack run."
 centaur_23_duststorm_ambushers: "Duststorm Ambushers"
 centaur_23_duststorm_ambushersDESCR: "Wielding the standard Eynükhe shield and saber and supported by archers, the Ambushers wear leather armor with a thick woolen cape. In battle they stealthily circle the enemy, gradually closing in and picking up speed, raising massive duststorms to blind opposing forces while the thunderous flapping of their capes deafens and disorients. As they continue to circle, small groups break off to charge through to the other side, slashing at the enemy along the way."
 centaur_23_dunnenh_impulsers: "Dunnenh Impulsers"
 centaur_23_dunnenh_impulsersDESCR: "As the centaurs settled down and civilized, they began to adopt more modern tactics and produced their own firearms. Each Dunnenh would be armed with 8 pistols and clad in lamellar armor. They used similar tactics to the old outriders except that a third of the army would charge the enemy with sabers after the first attack, with another third joining after each successive gun run until the entire unit was caught in the melee."
 centaur_26_taryean_raiders: "Taryean Raiders"
 centaur_26_taryean_raidersDESCR: "While charging directly into the enemy may no longer be a viable tactic, harassment with unmatched speed provides a means of not only picking off the unlucky soldier, but relentless strikes can leave an entire army dazed and frustrated."
 centaur_26_iomburvlait: "Iombürvlait"
 centaur_26_iomburvlaitDESCR: "Representing a union between Dunnenh and Eynükhe tactics, the Iombürvlait wears a suit of lamellar armor protecting their entire front half and a wool cape covering their backs. They wield a four barelled musket with a long bayonet and a distinctive notched shield to brace it upon. After firing they charge the enemy ranks with their lance-like bayonets, after breaking through they head off to reload their muskets and repeat the process."
 centaur_30_great_iomburvait: "Great Iombürvlait"
 centaur_30_great_iomburvaitDESCR: "Possibly the most feared sight on the Forbidden Plains, the Great Iombürvlait is entirely entombed within a virtually impenetrable suit of armor. They eschew the use of firearms, their masks make them too hard to aim. Instead they're armed with javelins and long lances. They begin their attack by slowly trotting towards the enemy, with their own ranks spread out. As they near the enemy they pick up speed and move closer to each other, running at full gallop and shoulder to shoulder by the time they meet the enemy, breaking through them with a surge of steel. Every Great Iombürvlait is accompanied by a staff of supporters to carry, maintain, and replace their equipment out of combat and serve as skirmishers in the heat of battle."
 centaur_30_keaghilyud_sharpshooters: "Keaghilyüd Sharpshooters"
 centaur_30_keaghilyud_sharpshootersDESCR: "Never seen but always present, the threat of the Keaghilyüds keeps many a Federation soldier jumping at every noise. Wearing a lamellar vest over a wool coat, the Keaghilyüd carries a massive rifle capable of punching a fist sized hole straight through an ogre's gut from more than half a kilometer away, along with a metal stand to hold it on while they aim. A Keaghilyüd will only fire 2 or 3 shots from any one location, packing up and moving to a new firing point to avoid being caught in melee, their only defense in such a situation being a saber and a few pistols."

 kobold_1_trappers: "Trappers"
 kobold_1_trappersDESCR: "The backbone of kobold warfare since time immemorial, trappers avoid losing standup fights with larger enemies by letting their foes come to them, straight onto their devious and deadly mechanisms. A few bitter ambushes make most enemies lose their taste for fighting."
 kobold_6_drake_riders: "Drake Riders"
 kobold_6_drake_ridersDESCR: "Kobolds had tamed drakes well before their recorded history, but the sacred nature of the dragonlike beasts meant risking them in warfare was taboo for centuries. However, in the face of human and gnomish incursion, desperate circumstances forced their handlers to attempt using drakes as combat cavalry. Their sheer effectiveness on the field helped shake this taboo."
 kobold_9_pikerunners: "Pike Runners"
 kobold_9_pikerunnersDESCR: "The first organized offensive kobold troops, the pike-runners used their stealth, agility, and pure moxie to duck right under the long pikes and weapons of their large opponents, striking brutal blows from beneath. While often costly and requiring close-quarters combat, the sheer determination of the pike-runners often put their larger foes off-guard."
 kobold_10_mounted_skirmishers: "Mounted Skirmishers"
 kobold_10_mounted_skirmishersDESCR: "As drakeback combat developed, the kobolds integrated their skirmishing tactics into their cavalry, with riders firing barrages of slingstones and arrows before clambering and scurrying back out of reach. One drake could carry an entire party of kobolds, making them all but impossible to ambush or flank"
 kobold_12_scions: "Scions"
 kobold_12_scionsDESCR: "Some kobolds are born larger, stronger, smarter, and braver than their fellows. Said among the kobolds to be blessed with the spirit of the dragons, the Scions gained in power as their size and strength became crucial to defending the kobold homelands."
 kobold_14_hoardcarts: "Hoardcarts"
 kobold_14_hoardcartsDESCR: "In the mid-1500s, particularly crafty and desperate kobold commanders began to use their own gold hoards as battle standards, hauled on drake-drawn carts in chests and piles. While this risked catastrophic loss of the hoard in the worst circumstances, any threat to the hoard would drive both kobold and drake to fight as though possessed."
 kobold_15_sappers: "Sappers"
 kobold_15_sappersDESCR: "Black powder revolutionized kobold engineering. Able to dig trenches, tunnels, stake pits, and spider holes faster than ever, the kobold sappers became terrors to their foes, able to appear as though from nowhere – usually with a bang – and turn even the hardest rocky terrain into a deathtrap."
 kobold_18_dragonflame_dreadnoughts: "Dragonflame Dreadnoughts"
 kobold_18_dragonflame_dreadnoughtsDESCR: "Kobold artificery developed the hoardcart into the ‘dreadnought’, an armored wagon pulled by armored drakes and filled with skirmishers. Equipped with fire-projectors spewing sticky “dragonflame”, the dreadnoughts became a crucial heavy punch for the kobold military, crashing into enemy lines ahead of the infantry and wreaking havoc. They would quickly become seen as a symbolic icon of the kobolds’ military and industrial advancements."
 kobold_19_dragonbreath_pistoliers: "Dragonbreath Pistoliers"
 kobold_19_dragonbreath_pistoliersDESCR: "The first proper all-firearm kobold regiment was the Dragonbreath Pistoliers, kobolds wielding fire-shooting handguns. On the one hand, their incendiary ammunition was often dangerously unreliable, and required their shooters to get uncomfortably close. On the other, however, the deadliness of the fire-gouting guns struck fear into the kobolds’ enemies, and the ability to shoot fire like a dragon bolstered their shooters’ desire to fight."
 kobold_23_thousand_shooters: "Thousand Shooters"
 kobold_23_thousand_shootersDESCR: "The Thousand Shooters gave the world its first true taste of kobold mass tactics. Using two or three kobolds to each shoot a full-size musket, the Thousand Shooters packed hundreds of gun-teams into lines nearly a dozen deep. The result was a formation where no amount of casualties suffered could reduce the torrent of gunfire it spat at their enemies."
 kobold_23_reforged_drakes: "Reforged Drakes"
 kobold_23_reforged_drakesDESCR: "As the kobolds began mastering biomodification artificery, one of their first successes was “reforging” their beloved drakes, making them larger, stronger, and melding their armor and scales. Now tougher and more agile than ever, the reforged drakes became a devastating vanguard for the Thousand Shooters, their charge something no army in the world could ignore."
 kobold_26_reforged_scions: "Reforged Scions"
 kobold_26_reforged_scionsDESCR: "As kobold artifice grew in skill, the Scions returned to favor in combat. Given scales as tough as iron, steel claws, and muscles that could let them tear through gun-shields like paper, the morale effect of these four-foot dragons launching themselves into enemy lines like living sawtraps was horrific."
 kobold_28_thundersnares: "Thundersnares"
 kobold_28_thundersnaresDESCR: "The kobolds' oldest friend, the ambush, became infinitely more deadly with the addition of artificery to the mix. Lightning arcs, landmines, gouting dragonflame projectors, and remote mechanisms often meant entire companies would be ripped apart even before the actual kobold troops arrived."
 kobold_28_drakemaws: "Drakemaws"
 kobold_28_drakemawsDESCR: "Masterworks of bio-artificery, the drakemaws are living dreadnoughts – gigantic drakes with scales hard as steel, fiery breath, and an armored shell-compartment on their back. A cadre of pistoleers ride inside, protected, picking off any threat to their living juggernaut as it burns and tears through the enemy line."
 kobold_30_wyrmspawn: "Wyrmspawn"
 kobold_30_wyrmspawnDESCR: "Kobold mastery of biomodification allowed them to create the Wyrmspawn, among the deadliest artificer soldiery in Cannor. Standing nearly the size of a man, able to fly in bursts, breathe fire like a dragon, and shrug off bullets with their steel scales, the Wyrmspawn almost resemble walking dragons themselves more than kobolds. Every opponent who faces them comes away with nightmares of being caught between a thundersnare trapline and a one-kobold platoon."

 darkscale_kobold_1_copper_cutters: "Copper Cutters"
 darkscale_kobold_1_copper_cuttersDESCR: "When the Darkscales were driven into the backwaters of the treacherous Serpentspine following the death of Nimrith the Red, they desperately sought out strength to subsist amongst many hostile tribes and peoples. Harkening to the fading words of their master, the warriors amongst Darkscale clans would gather and melt scavenged copper and deluge themselves in the smoldering metal to unleash untapped strength from their bodies. Miraculously, many of these warriors were bestowed with hardened scales and sharpened claws through these strange rituals, becoming the core of the fanatic armies of the Darkscale clan."
 darkscale_kobold_6_salamander_riders: "Salamander Riders"
 darkscale_kobold_6_salamander_ridersDESCR: "Serpentspine salamanders are creatures who dwell in damp caverns throughout the Serpentspine. Despite being large and carnivorous, the Serpentspine salamander is surprisingly docile when well-fed which lends itself to being tameable. The Darkscales would tame the salamanders as war mounts, taking advantage of their barbed tails and wall-climbing to launch brutal ambushes upon their enemies. The effectiveness of these salamanders both protected the Darkscales and fed the salamanders with the flesh of their fallen enemies."
 darkscale_kobold_9_bronzeblade_battalions: "Bronzeblade Battalions"
 darkscale_kobold_9_bronzeblade_battalionsDESCR: "After securing a humble powerbase in the caves of the northern Serpentspine, the Darkscales were blessed with the discovery of derelict mines left by the dwarves of old. The kobolds adamantly resumed extraction, and soon, the production of bronze and iron to strengthen their people’s military might. As a result, the next generation of Darkscale warriors would adopt bronze-scale rituals, further improving their bodies for battle when they could resist greater attacks and even fashion their claws into sword-like appendages that could tear through many enemies."
 darkscale_kobold_10_darkcliff_knights: "Darkcliff Knights"
 darkscale_kobold_10_darkcliff_knightsDESCR: "Unlike other war mounts, the Serpentspine salamander had exceptional regenerative properties which enabled it to regrow lost limbs and even detach its weaponized tail. Thus, it became common for salamanders to be used in short high-intensity shock charges, compensating for its dependence on wading in cave springs to remain hydrated. The Darkscales would maintain an experienced Ironskin company of salamander riders during long campaigns, sending them on flanking missions through cave cliffs to mask their approach before launching devastating attacks upon the distracted enemy."
 darkscale_kobold_12_ironskin_guardians: "Ironskin Guardians"
 darkscale_kobold_12_ironskin_guardiansDESCR: "With greater control over metal-making and their manpower issues, the armies of the Darkscales became more organized beyond their tribal foundations. One such example of their rapid development was the establishment of their first professional units that transcended tribal lines. The Ironskins were an experienced and war-hardened order of warriors originating from prestigious military clans with greater loyalty, martial prowess, and stronger iron-tempered bodies than the average Darkscale footsoldier. Always preparing for war, the Ironskins ensured that a second Scattering would never occur for the Darkscale kobolds."
 darkscale_kobold_14_silver_dragoons: "Silver Dragoons"
 darkscale_kobold_14_silver_dragoonsDESCR: "Salamander riders, seeking to maintain relevance in the rapidly-evolving battlefield, sought ways to improve their strength and firepower despite lacking gunpowder weapons. The Darkscales would train their salamander mounts to consistently spew fireballs at will, an ability that all Serpentspine salamanders latently shared when agitated in battle. This resulted in specialized companies of dragoons being born that provided the Darkscales with excellent skirmisher cavalry."
 darkscale_kobold_15_nimrithan_faithful: "Nimrithan Faithful"
 darkscale_kobold_15_nimrithan_faithfulDESCR: "Lacking gunpowder weapons, the Darkscales extensively explored alchemy as a means of bolstering the strength of their footsoldiers. As a result of their war alchemy, the Darkscales discovered a vile concoction they named Nimrith-ash that devoured both flesh and steel if aggravated with fire. The Darkscales would pack flammable bags filled with Nimrith-ash, sending their bravest soldiers to ignite and throw these projectiles against enemy formations. The blazes produced by the seething globules of Nimrith-ash would devour the terrain as if Nimrith himself unleashed his fury upon the battlefield."

 darkscale_kobold_18_magma_maraudersDESCR: "Evolving alchemy and artificery of the Darkscales guaranteed that their salamander mounts would inevitably transform to suit their military needs. Bio-artificery allowed the Darkscales to replicate their molten rituals upon their salamander mounts, liberating them from their skin’s dependency on water and granting them a new level of durability which rendered them fireproof. With their natural strength and fire-breathing, magma salamander riders were capable of joining the fray of battle in combined arms maneuvers to provide excellent firepower and cavalry support to the Darkscales’ infantry."

 darkscale_kobold_19_molten_onslaught_infantryDESCR: "Seeking the wisdom from the no-scales who dwelled within their territory, the Darkscales adopted the flame pressurizers that goblin artificers once crafted to melt their scales and flesh in battle. The Darkscales would produce sleeker burners with barrels made of special heat-resistant alloys that their alchemists discovered to enable their vanguard troops to unleash incendiary slime upon their enemies in close quarters combat. Although the intensity of these burners guaranteed that the resilience of their scales would be brutally tested, these weapons greatly enhanced the firepower of the Darkscales despite lacking gunpowder."
 darkscale_kobold_23_alloyed_auxiliaries: "Alloyed Auxiliaries"
 darkscale_kobold_23_alloyed_auxiliariesDESCR: "The ever-increasing complexity of the Darkscales’ cave mining schemes promoted greater exploration on alloying to improve the quality of their tools and scales. As a result, once-exclusive ironskin became cheaper and more accessible to the next generation of Darkscale warriors. With many new warriors embracing iron alloy scales, the Ironskins grew immensely and effectively supplanted the traditional clan warhosts as the Darkscales’ means of mobilizing and training military forces as warfare in the Serpentspine became more deadly and unpredictable.

 darkscale_kobold_23_firefang_dreadnoughtsDESCR: "The magma salamander continued to artificially evolve through constant bio-modification by the Darkscales, making them stronger, faster, and more resilient than ever before. The dreadnought salamander was one such breakthrough in bio-artificery, which accelerated its body’s regenerative properties; not only were their bodies sturdier, but the barbs on their tails could be magically agitated to be fired like shrapnel. When combined with the magma they internally produced, dreadnought salamanders could plow through battalions after bombarding them with fire breath and shrapnel which filled the roads and caverns of the Serpentspine."

 darkscale_kobold_26_platinated_corpsDESCR: "When iron alloy scales became predominant amongst the Darkscales’ soldiers, the old guard of elite military families sought to further enhance themselves to differentiate themselves from the masses. Discovering old stashes of platinum scattered near Haraz-Ordulum, the scions of legacy Ironskins augmented themselves by covering themselves in platinum scales, enhancing their durability and strength beyond the common warriors. Petitioning to the Darkscales’ leadership for special privileges in exchange for their continued service, the Platinated Corps was created as an elite vanguard force that wielded Nimrith-ash projectors forged by the country’s finest artificers."

 darkscale_kobold_28_knights_of_molten_drakeDESCR: "Although the Darkscales lacked drakes, they strived to emulate their power through their profound understanding of bio-artificery. The salamanders that once protected the hovels of the Darkscale clan were unrecognizable, transformed into draconic beasts that could unleash salvos of devastating missiles, spew carbonizing flames, and withstand any weapon fired against them. Those who raised and controlled these war machines became a new elite force in Darkscale military organization, modern knights who commanded the power of fire and the immense potency of their salamanders to serve their late master: Nimrith the Red."

 darkscale_kobold_28_red_wings_of_reprisalDESCR: "Hearing of the vast potential of artificery in the field of bio-modification, the Darkscales embraced the ideas of their distant cousins in order to further emulate the likeness of their late master Nimrith the Red. To better adjust to the environment of the caverns of the Serpentspine, the Darkscales’ scions grafted wide patagia onto their limbs; equipped with air-powered launchers to gain momentum, these scions could glide deep into the battlefield and scatter incendiary bombs upon their enemies. These scions would be known as the Red Wings, for their bodies were painted with deep red dye to emulate Nimrith."
 darkscale_kobold_30_nimriths_brood: "Nimrith's Brood"
 darkscale_kobold_30_nimriths_broodDESCR: "The bio-modification of the Darkscales gradually became more ambitious and obsessive in pursuit of emulating Nimrith the Red. The Darkscales’ scions approached the likeness and power of their former master: every improvement upon alloying ensured their scales became more invulnerable, every innovation in bio-artificery brought them closer to aerial and physical superiority, every upgrade to their Nimrith-ash projectors made them more self-sustaining and devastating. Eventually, even the most skeptical couldn’t deny the draconic similitude of the modern Darkscale scion, for they wholly replicated Nimrith’s likeness on the scorched battlefield."

 taychendi_1_sabre_warriorsDESCR: "The Sabre Warriors of Larankar serve as a more disciplined version of the levies found elsewhere in Taychend. Hailing from the hilly and mountainous northern highlands, the Sabre Warriors are generally of a hardier stock than their southern brethren. Utilizing the preferred weapons of the Larankar, iron sabres, and a vision and discipline less readily found in the rest of Taychend, Sabre Warriors are less easily broken in battle and more cohesive in their formations. This cohesion does come at a cost, losing some of the offensive potential of the chaotic, sprawling Levy armies, but the Sabre Warriors serve a greater vision."
 taychendi_1_yodhan_levies: "Yodhan Levies"
 taychendi_1_yodhan_leviesDESCR: "As a region torn by constant warfare and Warlordism, Taychend’s primary form of military organization has for centuries been centered around levies loyal to their “Yodhan,” or local warlord. Experienced in the ways of war, most levies wield iron swords or spears. The resource rich lands of Taychend ensure that virtually all Taychendi have access to quality weapons - and the constant state of war ensures experience from a young age. The levies rely more on sheer numbers to overrun their enemies than any maneuvering or tactics, and may dissolve quickly if their Yodhan falls, fleeing to the service of whoever offers them food, safety, and victory. In great numbers, the Yodhan Levies are a fearsome and chaotic force."
 taychendi_1_swarm_riders: "Matirai"
 taychendi_1_swarm_ridersDESCR: "The Yodhan of the Taychendi prized their cavalry for its mobility and maneuverability, but approached their mounted forces in a similarly chaotic way to their infantry levies. Taychendi “Matirai” (translated to common as Horse Riders) focused on overwhelming their enemies with numbers, swiftly flanking their enemies and overrunning them with similar terrifying mass tactics. The lack of strong Cannorian horses left the Taychendi mostly reliant on light cavalry, making them effective messengers and mobile riders, but less effective at charging their opponents."
 taychendi_1_mounted_sabres: "Mounted Sabres"
 taychendi_1_mounted_sabresDESCR: "The Mounted Sabres of Larankar were unique among the Taychendi cavalry for understanding the importance and value of group cohesion alongside maneuverability. While losing some of the terror that came with swarms of Taychendi throwing their horses at enemy levies, the Sabre Warriors maintained formation and utilized their favored sabres to great effect, dismounting to engage enemy forces and withstanding enemy charges without dissolving. Further, the highland peoples of Larankar possessed breeds of horse stockier and stronger than the light lowland horses, allowing them to use rudimentary horse armor to protect their mounts. These tactics proved essential in maintaining Larankar’s hold over the region."

United by a vision of a Taychend unified under Larankarha rule, Amarawor’s Chosen have honed the Sabre Warrior art to create elite units capable of breaking the morale of their often unorganized opponents. Their Taychendi parentage is still apparent despite their more honed approach, as they do not shy from bringing the fight to their enemies, even when seemingly outmatched."

Having distinguished themselves in battle for their local Yodhan, the Hired Katti are drawn from the more skilled ranks of the more undisciplined levies. Having proven they could survive and thrive in the chaotic lands of Taychend, the Katti now enjoy the patronage of rulers to train and supplement the levies, and supply a more loyal and stable core to the often fickle and fleeting levies of the Yodhan."
 taychendi_6_taychendi_horse_archers: "Taychendi Horse Archers"
 taychendi_6_taychendi_horse_archersDESCR: "The abundance of light cavalry in Taychend led to innovations in mounted tactics, chief among them the rapid ascent of horse archery as an effective tactic in warfare. The chaotic nature of Taychendi warfare significantly raised the value of skirmishers, especially as a tactic to remain engaged with swarms of Taychendi levies without being overrun. The light cavalry of the region were well suited to just such an adaptation, and few Yodhan would dare go into battle without a complement of mounted archers to supplement their forces."
 taychendi_6_larankar_lancers: "Larankar Lancers"
 taychendi_6_larankar_lancersDESCR: "Larankar’s cavalry followed a different evolution than the rest of Taychend, transforming their Sabre Riders into something approximating heavy cavalry found elsewhere. Their stronger horses relative to their lowland counterparts gave the Lancers the ability to readily shock enemy forces into rapidly dissolving, and to withstand the swarm tactics of enemy levies to greater effect. As such, the “Larankar Lancers,” distinguished themselves as the most effective cavalry in Taychend, able to contend with Katti, Horse Archers, or foreign adversaries."

 taychendi_9_tenvachi_spearsDESCR: "Increased exposure to the Kheionai “Phalanx” style of combat formation practiced by the Ambhen led the Taychendi state of Vul Tenvach to begin to adapt these tactics with their own levy forces. The resultant “Tenvachi Spears” utilize similar weapons and combat tactics of the Kheionai, but staffed by native Taychendi soldiers. Lacking somewhat in the discipline and experience of their Ambhen counterparts, the Tenvachi Spears offer greater offensive potential borne from the fearsome and chaotic nature of Taychendi warfare."

 taychendi_10_mahred_varyana_flankersDESCR: "Sacrificing armor and strength, the Marhed Varanya Flankers were renowned for their speed, rumored to be able to traverse distances thought impossible for mortal beings. Their secret lay in the utilization of small, fast, nearly entirely unencumbered horses and the presence of “deserts” (actually dried up lakes) near their Kingdom, using speed and seemingly impassable terrain to appear behind enemy armies to launch devastating surprise attacks on their rear. Even when less able to obscure their formations with friendly terrain, the swiftness of their horses and seeming omnipresence struck fear in the hearts of their enemies, and led Marhed Varanya to many surprise victories."
 taychendi_10_lamellar_riders: "Lamellar Riders"
 taychendi_10_lamellar_ridersDESCR: "The Lamellar Riders of the Larankar paralleled in many ways the Cannorian style of armed knights, equipping their horses with heavy armor in a manner unsuitable for the fleeter horses found to the South. Fully armored and designed to charge enemy formations, the Lamellar Riders were an attempt by the Larankar to develop a cavalry force capable of breaking the powerful Kheionai phalanx formations of the Ameioni. While the Highland horses may have been inferior to their Cannorian counterparts, the ferocity and offensive inclination of Taychendi warriors made charging enemy forces hardly a foreign or uncomfortable concept, and the terrifying offensive potential of these units was noted by their foes."

 taychendi_12_urvand_honorboundDESCR: "As Larankara armies were crushed by the Sun Elf invasion, the forces of the Larankarha capital of Urvand stood as the last defense of all Larankhara faith, culture, and heritage. Only after the city was conquered and sacked by the Sun Elves and their Taychendi allies did the Sun Elf invasion falter, as the Taychendi refused to submit fully to Sun Elf rule. The Urvand Honorbound who served before, during, and after the invasion prided themselves on the loyalty to their people - never having sought an alliance with foreigners or engaged in any treachery to their people. Fighting doggedly against overwhelming odds, the Honorbound proved a determination and discipline far and above their other Taychendi counterparts. Even after the withdrawal of the invaders, the Urvand Honorbound became renowned for their ability to withstand enemy charges and maintain the fight against difficult odds, rarely retreating in the face of danger."

 taychendi_12_orenkoraim_arquebusiersDESCR: "Among the Taychendi Kingdoms, the Kingdom of Orenkoraim proved most open to foreign trade and ideas. This openness led to the import of the first foreign firearms into Taychend through Orenkoraim’s ports, organizing the first arquebusiers regiments. Constructed abroad, the weapons found great use by all parties within Taychend - be they internal conflicts between Taychendi, Taychendi resisting Sun Elf invasions, or the growing tensions between Ambhen and Taychendi. As Orenkoraim avoided most of the devastation of the Sun Elf invasions, the Kingdom became both a center for trade and a nexus for arms and mercenaries seeking to repel the invaders."
 taychendi_14_kalavend_caracole: "Kalavend Caracole"
 taychendi_14_kalavend_caracoleDESCR: "The proliferation of firearms in Taychend resulted in the creation of Caracole units, much in the style of the horse archers of old. The light and agile Taychendi horses served the purpose of armed horseback combat well, developing Caracole formations early in Taychend’s military development. The Kalavendi in particular extensively practiced this tactic - charging at enemy forces in rows, discharging one firearm, turning to discharge the other, then retreating to the back row to reload, gradually advancing on opposing formations. With ideal mounts and battle hardened riders, the Kalavend Caracole could unleash devastating losses on their opponents."

 taychendi_15_fotistrepei_immitationsDESCR: "As the Ameioni forces filled the power vacuum left by the devastating Sun Elf invasions, the crumbling Taychendi Kingdoms sought to imitate their invaders and adopt their tactics in order to resist. The Fotistrépei of the Ameoini were kheionized Taychendi offered land and privilege for their services to provide a native force for their invasion, and the Taychendi states increasingly imitated this system in order to staff and organize their armies along similarly efficient lines. The degree to which this was successful varied, but represented an important innovation of both resistance and intermixing of the two cultures."

 taychendi_15_nanru_nakar_cityguardsDESCR: "With the collapse of most of the Taychendi Kingdoms and the eclipsing of the once mighty Larankar, the now united city of Nanru Nakar became the focal point for Taychendi military and economic power. The Nanru Nakar Cityguards became the exemplars of order in a region largely forged by chaos, and the only force formidable enough to offer any level of resistance to the Ameoini invasion. Well staffed by the burgeoning population of the city, and equipped by its immense mercantile trade, the Cityguards represented an effective force - be they as defenders of the city, or as mercenaries to the other Taychendi Kingdoms fighting the Ameioni invaders."
 taychendi_18_orenkoraim_cuirassiers: "Orenkoraim Cuirassiers"
 taychendi_18_orenkoraim_cuirassiersDESCR: "While Taychendi horses served as ideal mounts for skirmishing and irregular combat tactics, the Orenkoraim found them no substitute for stronger and sturdier Cannorian mounts. Facing increasingly long odds and difficult to dislodge Kheonai pikemen and grenadiers, the Orenkoraim imported massive amounts of Cannorian horses and bred them to create elite Cuirassiers units, staffed and trained by Cannorian mercenaries. Finally abandoning lances and focusing on saber and pistol combat with lighter armed riders atop stronger steeds, the Orenkoraim Cuirassiers were able to inflict heavy losses on opposing infantry formations."

 taychendi_19_clematar_squareDESCR: "The increasing aggression of the cat-riding Chendhyans forced innovation among the Taychendi, with the Clemetar serving as the first line of defense against their incursions. The agile and deadly cat-like cavalry units necessitated a new form of defense, and Clemetar militaries quickly adopted an infantry square formation that would be known as the “Clemetar Square.” By forming an outward facing perimeter and securing all possible flanks of their infantry formations, the Taychendhi severely hampered the Chendhyans’ ability to destroy their battle lines with powerful feline mounts."
 taychendi_19_sibisimra_skirmishers: "Sibisimra Skirmishers"
 taychendi_19_sibisimra_skirmishersDESCR: "Sibisimra resisted Ameioni invasion fiercely, never truly falling entirely to their rule. Among their more effective tactics for resistance was to avoid pitched battle against their largely superior foes - focusing instead on irregular and agile formations, dissolving and reforming when placed on the defensive. This proved particularly effective against more orthodox Ameoini military maneuvers, and allowed Sibisimra and similar Taychendi states to extend their resistance, and inflict considerable casualties on the foreign incursion."
 taychendi_23_kalavendhi_gun_brigades: "Kalavendhi Gun Brigades"
 taychendi_23_kalavendhi_gun_brigadesDESCR: "With foreign weapons well available in Taychend, the line infantry tactics of abroad were fully adopted by many of the Taychendi states. Along the lower Kalavendhi in particular, brigades of infantry lining up to face their opponents became the standard tactic, especially as the gap in technology and innovation between Ameoini and Taychendi began to narrow. A region already rich in both resources and manpower, war only focused the boons of Taychend into nearly endless lines of infantry ready to repel the Ameoini invaders."
 taychendi_23_royakottar_vanguard: "Royakottar Vanguard"
 taychendi_23_royakottar_vanguardDESCR: "Founded on the front lines between the great Taychendi states and the Ameioni invaders, the Royakottar distinguished themselves as fierce warriors, and adopted tactics designed to withstand the punishing onslaught of the Ameioni invasion. Chief among their innovations was the creation of the “Royakottar Vanguard,” elite units that stood at the front of the battle lines. Ready to absorb enemy charges and bravely withstand the initial volleys of an engagement, their superior discipline and training ensured the survival of the formation - and that their units would inflict disproportionate casualties on all opposing lines."
 taychendi_23_nanru_nakar_dragoons: "Nanru Nakar Dragoons"
 taychendi_23_nanru_nakar_dragoonsDESCR: "With limited availability of Cannorian imports compared to the Orenkoraim, the Nanru Nakar Dragoons relied on their traditional swift Taychendi horses to produce units of skirmishing cavalry designed to harass opposing forces. This proved devastating to the Ameioni, as skirmishing tactics by the Taychendi whittled down their forces in an increasingly one-sided war of attrition. The Dragoons were particularly adept at this, utilizing their mounts to evade capture and open battle, hitting supply lines, vulnerable holes in defensive formations, key geographic areas, and any other targets considered valuable in a war of maneuver. With less focus on cavalry charges and serving as more of a form of mobile infantry, the dragoons could wield heavier rifles and inflict considerably higher casualties than their pistol-wielding forebears."
 taychendi_26_mahred_varyana_grenadiers: "Marhed Varanya Grenadiers"
 taychendi_26_mahred_varyana_grenadiersDESCR: "Invigorated by the continued deterioration of the Ameioni invasions, and channeling the aggressive and chaotic Taychendi heritage, the Grenadiers of Marhed Varanya distinguished themselves as the most effective offensive formations in all of Taychend. Wielding early forms of artificer-enhanced hand grenades, the Grenadiers tore apart Ameoni formations and led charges with such vigor not seen since the days of the Yodhan centuries before. Service in the grenadiers required considerable stature, fortitude, and bravery on a scale approaching recklessness."
 taychendi_26_yodhanpir_irregulars: "Yodhanpir Irregulars"
 taychendi_26_yodhanpir_irregularsDESCR: "Ever facing daunting odds, the Taychendi had resorted to irregular tactics and skirmishing since the early days of the Ambhen conquests, and changes in technology and tactics had only served to enhance their ability to harass the invaders. A key advantage the Taychendi had over their Ambhen opponents was that of numbers - and in the ensuing wars of attrition, the Taychendi would ultimately emerge victorious. The use of irregular forces loyal to local Yodhans, never truly pacified by the Ambhen or their servants, ensured that any overwhelming military advantage enjoyed by the Ambhen would slowly whittle away in the face of occupation and endless engagements."
 taychendi_28_degithioni_carabiniers: "Degithioni Carabiniers"
 taychendi_28_degithioni_carabiniersDESCR: "Wielding a light carbine rifle, the Degithioni Carabiners represented the latest form of mobile infantry innovation in the Taychend. Ruled by an Ameioni ruler who deferred most aspects of cavalry to his Taychendi subjects, Degithioni would come to typify the synthesis of Ameioni and Taychendi military thought. The small and agile Taychendi horses would be ridden by Taychendi but organized along Ameioni lines, with small but disciplined Carabiner units seeking to flank and harass enemy formations much like the later Échate or Klecherand Infantry."
 taychendi_30_klerechend_infantry: "Klerechend Infantry"
 taychendi_30_klerechend_infantryDESCR: "A synthesis of Ambhen and Taychendi culture, the Kleyeren similarly adopted Ambhen military tactics. More defensively oriented than their pure-blooded Taychendi cousins, the Klecherend infantry were also more conservative in their reliance on artificery, more similar to the Échate League Infantry of the remnant Ameioni forces. These forces relied on superior equipment and training to prevail over their opponents, approaching combat with units able to divide into smaller components to distract, flank, and avoid their enemies, only to reform into a large force in more advantageous terrain. This flexibility made dislodging such formations extremely difficult, and opponents often found themselves facing a combined formation in one direction - only to have it reform at their flanks, or their rear."
 taychendi_30_triple_alliance_infantry: "Triple Alliance Infantry"
 taychendi_30_triple_alliance_infantryDESCR: "The “Triple Alliance” of the Taychendi nations of Marhed Varanya, Nanru Nakar, and Royakattar produced some of the most feared offensive formations found in Taychend. The infantry of these nations were enhanced by the presence of immoral artificers - willing to utilize any and all available technology to gain a competitive advantage, regardless of the cost.  Forged by over a century of resistance to foreign invasion, the offensively oriented Triple Alliance Infantry equipped their soldiers with all the tools necessary to tear through enemy forces with a ferocity unmatched by any potential opponents. Infantry were known to yield explosives, enhanced spark rifles with explosive rounds, and battlesuits adorned and enhanced with images of the Taychendi gods."
