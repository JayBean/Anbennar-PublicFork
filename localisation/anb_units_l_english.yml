 cannorian_1_medieval_infantry:0 "Medieval Infantry"
 cannorian_1_medieval_infantryDESCR:0 "The basic soldier of Cannorian armies. They tended to be peasant levies with little or no training and very poor equipment. However when deployed en masse they could be devastating.."
 cannorian_1_medieval_knights:0 "Medieval Knights"
 cannorian_1_medieval_knightsDESCR:0 "The medieval Knight originated with the Castanorian hero Caylen Longlance's reforms, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread through Cannor and became an integral part of the feudal system, in which knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."
 cannorian_5_longbow:0 "Damerian Longbowmen"
 cannorian_5_longbowDESCR:0 "Despite the elven stereotype of being master-archers, it was actually their long-term allies, the Damerians, that taught them the art of the bow. Up until the end of the Lilac Wars, the longbow was the Damerian weapon-of-choice, and were the bane of many a Lorentish knight."
 cannorian_5_men_at_arms:0 "Men-at-Arms"
 cannorian_5_men_at_armsDESCR:0 "The Man-at-Arms was a professional soldier in Cannorian armies of the late middle ages. Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier, often bearing steel from the many foundries and workshops that rose during the time, such as the dwarves of Silverforge and the Vanburies of Telgeir. During the Lilac Wars, Men-at-Arms were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights. The better equipped and better trained were known as Sergeants-at-Arms."
 cannorian_9_adventurer_band:0 "Adventurer Bands"
 cannorian_9_adventurer_bandDESCR:0 "Adventurers have been both a boon and a bane across Cannor for years. Often troublesome, but also offering a wide breadth of experience and insight beyond the common soldier - by integrating adventurers within our armies it allows us to cover a wide breadth of situations and draw upon their expertise."
 cannorian_9_pike_and_shot:0 "Pike & Shot"
 cannorian_9_pike_and_shotDESCR:0 "It is said that the Pike & Shot helped win the Greentide - and that the thunderous roar of gunfire caused even the bravest of orcish hordes to hesitate. Earlier variants had heavily armoured pikemen and halberdiers supported by embedded arquebusiers in order to both strike fear and gun down orcs and be able to face them in close combat. After the Greentide the armoured pikemen portion slowly fell out of favour to lighter cuirasses or no heavy armour at all."
 cannorian_10_gun_knights:0 "Gun Knights"
 cannorian_10_gun_knightsDESCR:0 "With the advent of smaller firearms by gnomish inventors, knights and other heavy cavalrymen often carried several pistols with them in battle to discharge at close range during their charges."
 cannorian_12_thorn_formation:0 "Thorn Formation"
 cannorian_12_thorn_formationDESCR:0 "The Thorn Formation was a mixed infantry formation of pikemen and musketeers. Because of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed both the rigidity of its heavy infantry and the long-range firepower of its musketeers, making it an ideal defensive and offensive formation. Originally developed by the Lorentish general Darien síl Ainethán during its Wars of Dominion against Gawed it proved that a smaller, defensive and elite Lorentish force could defeat the larger mass of Gawedi infantry (who at that time were still primarily using melee weapons)."
 cannorian_14_outriders:0 "Outriders"
 cannorian_14_outridersDESCR:0 "As guns became more easily mass-produced the role of the knight in mounted combat diminished. No longer did cavalry need specialized training, money or noble-birth, but instead simply be able to charge, swing and shoot."
 cannorian_15_volley_infantry:0 "Volley Infantry"
 cannorian_15_volley_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Halfling War of Independence the halfling armies were outmatched by the pike/musket combination of the Lorentish Thorn Formations. As halflings could not wield pikes due to their stature, they developed a new tactic relying on mass fire with lines twelve, six or eight musketeers deep. When the first ranked line fired, they would run move to the rear and the second line would fire. Due to the availability of muskets and more importantly, the large populations of halflings, this system negated the long reload relating to muskets, and stood well against the more defensive and stationary Thorn Formation."
 cannorian_18_reformed_outriders:0 "Reformed Outriders"
 cannorian_18_reformed_outridersDESCR:0 "The advent of more reliable and accurate guns reformed the army as a whole, moving to a lighter armoured infantry core that wielded rifles as their primary weapon. In return heavy armour was no longer prized in battle, as the usual bullet could penetrate it, and outriders soon abandoned heavier plate to just a simple breastplate."
 cannorian_19_thorn_formation2:0 "Ashen Thorn Formation"
 cannorian_19_thorn_formation2DESCR:0 "Over time bullets became deadlier and armour became more and more obsolete. As armies changed to lighter cavalry and less-armoured infantry, the famous Thorn Formation replaced a large majority of their pikemen with more musketeers, hence the 'ash'."
 cannorian_23_dragoons:0 "Escanni Dragoons"
 cannorian_23_dragoonsDESCR:0 "In 17th century Escann, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon (named after the core sigil of Escann). Dragoons were widely used by all Cannorian nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 cannorian_23_line_infantry:0 "Line Infantry"
 cannorian_23_line_infantryDESCR:0 "Line infantry tactics tried to find a balance between attack and defense and did not specialize in either. However, these infantry were stronger in fire and shock. Their aim would be to use the musket volleys to disorganize the enemy before they could charge, in particular if they were primarily a shock action force."
 cannorian_26_carabiners:0 "Carabiners"
 cannorian_26_carabinersDESCR:0 "The Carabiners first came into being in the 16th century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armor, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between them was their armament. Carabiners main weapon was the carabine, sometimes also called the arquebus, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carabine, they were also armed with pistols and a sword."
 cannorian_26_rosecoat_infantry:0 "Rosecoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_rosecoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Rosecoat infantry seek to emulate Lorent's founder, Lorenan the Great, and his devastating charges against the Gawed invaders."
 cannorian_26_dovecoat_infantry:0 "Dovecoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_dovecoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Due to the high population of Anbennar, Dovecoat infantry focused on simply taking volleys and overwhelming the enemy with numbers."
 cannorian_26_dragoncoat_infantry:0 "Dragoncoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_dragoncoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Dragoncoat infantry rely on being able to take damage and deal it back tenfold, similar to how a dragon's scale can withstand damage and a dragon's breathe can cause it."
 cannorian_28_impulse_infantry:0 "Impulse Infantry"
 cannorian_28_impulse_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Wars of the Northern League, the main Gawedi army was outmatched and faltering. To make up for this, irregular units from the frontier, such as hunters from the Greatwoods, were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed Gawedi armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the Cannorian battlefield. The most extreme solution was the impulse warfare unit. These units put forward a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."
 cannorian_28_cuirassier:0 "Cuirassier"
 cannorian_28_cuirassierDESCR:0 "The Cuirassier takes its name from the Cuirass, a breast plate worn by the heaviest cavalry units. Wielding a heavy sword rather than a light saber, these units are fearsome when they charge. Usually supported by units of carbine equipped cavalry to give them extra punch, these units add shock power to any army."
 cannorian_30_drill_infantry:0 "Ancardian Drill Infantry"
 cannorian_30_drill_infantryDESCR:0 "The Ancardian Reforms revolutionized early modern warfare, instilling the reliance of simple yet effective drills to not only maximize firepower output but a reinforced and near-unbreakable line."
 cannorian_30_sparkdrive_irregulars:0 "Sparkdrive Irregulars"
 cannorian_30_sparkdrive_irregularsDESCR:0 "The Sparkdrive Rifle was a strange gnomish invention that was said to contain an essence of a lightning elemental, operated by a rotating lever that charged the rifle and shot a burst of concentrated lightning. Eventually these Sparkdrive companies, also known as 'Cranker Companies' after the sound of the lever, were a prized part of warfare, often used to snipe enemy commanders in the battlefield, and even targetting armies as they camped."

 dwarven_1_shieldwall:0 "Shieldwalls"
 dwarven_1_shieldwallDESCR:0 "An ancient military tactic, the shieldwall was no doubt done best by its creators, the dwarves. A line of armorclad warriors holding iron-plated tower shields separated by thin gaps to let pikes through, this strategy has proven an effective defensive formation time and time again, ensuring both the safety of dwarven men and the slow demise of the enemy."
 dwarven_5_massed_clockwork_bows:0 "Massed Clockwork Bows"
 dwarven_5_massed_clockwork_bowsDESCR:0 "The fall of Aul-Dwarov saw much knowledge lost to the ages, but a few remnants of military ingenuity remain. The primary example of this was the Clockwork Bow, an alloyed composite bow capable of exerting pressure on its own coiled steel bowstring. The additional tension helps to launch bolts at unfathomable speeds, making quick work of hostile warbands when launched in concentrated volleys. Expense and tradition would make such items much more expensive than contemporary crossbows, and eventually would be phased out by firearms."
 dwarven_5_tortoise_formation:0 "Tortoise Formation"
 dwarven_5_tortoise_formationDESCR:0 "The life of a single dwarf is worth far more than the death of a single goblin, and thus dwarven military doctrine tended to prioritize self-preservation above all else. This concept was realized in the classic Tortoise Formation, a mix between the classic shieldwall and the one-sided phalanx. Though ultimately situational, its ability to defend from missiles and footmen alike made it a mainstay of adventurer bands in the Dwarovar during the early stages of the Reclamation."
 dwarven_9_pepper_and_tortoise:0 "Pepper and Tortoise"
 dwarven_9_pepper_and_tortoiseDESCR:0 "Though good at keeping dwarven soldiers alive, the classical Tortoise Formation lacked any semblance of maneuverability or offensive capability. With recent advancements in clockwork and gunpowder weaponry, this weakness was quickly rectified, stationing ranged 'Pepperers' in the middle of the tortoise shell with small openings for projectiles to pass through. This method allowed the formation to maintain its rigid defense whilst maintaining some semblance of pressure on the enemy."
 dwarven_9_remnant_harquebusiers:0 "Remnant Harquebusiers"
 dwarven_9_remnant_harquebusiersDESCR:0 "One of the many technologies salvaged from the fall of Aul-Dwarov, the methods regarding the construction and upkeep of firearms were largely lost, leaving survivors with remarkably few instances of true arquebuses. This all changed with the eventual progression of smithing precision and production utilities, eventually culminating in the first widespread recreation of ancient dwarven firearms: the dwarven harquebus. Though ultimately less effective than the Cannorian arquebus that, within a few decades, would dominate Cannorian warfare, it was an important stepping stone in the pursuit of lost knowledge, and especially the pursuit of even deadlier weapons."
 dwarven_12_clockwork_riflemen:0 "Clockwork Riflemen"
 dwarven_12_clockwork_riflemenDESCR:0 "Many of the shortcomings present in the harquebus were soon addressed by adapting the clockwork mechanics of dwarven bows and crossbows into the loading and priming mechanisms of modern firearms. The results were vastly improved firing speeds, and despite the relative weakness of each projectile, the sheer quantity of bullets was enough to drown out any potential critics of the unreliable weapons."
 dwarven_12_runic_greataxes:0 "Runic Greataxes"
 dwarven_12_runic_greataxesDESCR:0 "Despite runesmithing's decline outside of the Dwarovar, inside the vast mountain range the practice was very much alive. Runes of durability were engraved upon the pommels of mithril-etched greataxes, wielded by elite warriors in enchanted armor to serve as the vanguard of a hold's grand army. Few of the dwarves' machinations managed to inspire fear into the remnants of Korgus' empire as well as the sheer power of these weapons of unending death."
 dwarven_15_fire_and_tortoise:0 "Fire and Tortoise"
 dwarven_15_fire_and_tortoiseDESCR:0 "Violently clinging to life, the ancient Tortoise Formation experienced a notable resurgence at the dawn of the 17th century with its unique ability to prove an immovable obstacle on the battlefield. Replacing the iron shields of old with dwarven steel made for effective bulletproof mobile fortifications, allowing the short-statured gunmen to take up superior positions and rain hell upon the fiends that dared to stand in their sights."
 dwarven_15_scattergun_auxiliaries:0 "Scattergun Auxiliaries"
 dwarven_15_scattergun_auxiliariesDESCR:0 "As the rest of the world managed to grasp the foundations of blackpowder warfare, the dwarves were already adapting these rudimentary tactics into the field of unconventional warfare. Harquebus-fire lacked the versatility to deal with stagnant lines or sturdy fortifications, and thus from the cradle of necessity, the scattergun was brought into the world. Firing a close spread of pellets as opposed to a single ball, the scattergun managed to maintain relevance in both long-range skirmishes and close-range engagements. Despite its apparent effectiveness, its lack of durability and the inability of runesmiths to rectify this issue ultimately doomed it to early retirement."
 dwarven_19_rotary_vanguards:0 "Rotary Vanguards"
 dwarven_19_rotary_vanguardsDESCR:0 "New and improved rotary guns utilize existing clockwork technology to spin a four-barrel tube, ejecting high-velocity ordinance at an unprecedented rate. Its lack of accuracy and inability to move during use were major flaws, but its raw destructive power oft compensated for its tactical shortcomings. By placing these devastating weapons at the head of the vanguard, dwarven armies were able to substantially soften up enemies before the main force engaged."
 dwarven_19_skullcrusher_brigades:0 "Skullcrusher Brigades"
 dwarven_19_skullcrusher_brigadesDESCR:0 "The ever-present traditionalist movements present in dwarven society had great impact even in the army, with many dwarves choosing to adapt the fierce tactics employed by the adventurer bands of old into modern formations in an attempt to relive the glory of the Reclamation. Though these attempts typically ended in disaster, the Skullcrusher Brigades were a notable exception. Comprised of veteran adventurers and expeditionaries, these units employed an odd mix of warriors, rangers, and mages to wreak havoc upon enemy lines in a horrific cacophony of bloodshed and terror."
 dwarven_23_grudgesettlers:0 "The Grudgesettlers"
 dwarven_23_grudgesettlersDESCR:0 "A new generation of adventurers means a new generation of veterans–and new faces to fight for the same grudges of old. As the Skullcrusher Brigades began to retire, the unsettled grudges of the last remnants of the Reclamation spurred new blood to form independent units of mercenary-adventurers, continuing the Skullcrushers' role in the battlefield wielding firearms laced with an incendiary agent. It is said that as the corpses of our enemies smolder, retribution for past transgressions grows ever-closer to being fully paid."
 dwarven_23_steelcoat_infantry:0 "Steelcoat Infantry"
 dwarven_23_steelcoat_infantryDESCR:0 "The Cannorians truly lack a sense of naming. They boast so-called 'Dovecoat Infantry', despite the pigeons possessing no viciousness nor strength on their own. The resolve of a dwarf cannot be relegated to a mere bird. With skin made of iron and steel in our bones, we have devised a far more fitting, and far more literal, moniker. Dwarven Steelcoat Infantrymen don coats lined with thin, lightweight sheets of steel to provide additional defense against the pesky pellets that other races are so fond of flinging."
 dwarven_26_hotshot_rotary_gunners:0 "Hotshot Rotary Gunners"
 dwarven_26_hotshot_rotary_gunnersDESCR:0 "Rudimentary gun placements modified to accept incendiary ammunition, these upgraded rotary guns address many of the issues prevalent in previous designs. Primarily, the lack of maneuverability had been fixed by reducing the caliber the weapon uses, with bullets each engraved with a flame rune to substitute for the overall loss in firepower."
 dwarven_26_splintered_tortoise_formation:0 "Splintered Tortoise Formation"
 dwarven_26_splintered_tortoise_formationDESCR:0 "The final iteration before its eventual extinction, the famed Tortoise Formation found new life with the propagation of stationary rotary guns in the modern battlefield. The minor improvements in mobility allowed the guns to move alongside the slothful tortoise shell, with specialized shielding placed at the front of the guns as both protection and for gunners to camouflage into the immutable formation."
 dwarven_28_forgefire_repeaters:0 "Forgefire Repeaters"
 dwarven_28_forgefire_repeatersDESCR:0 "The resurgence of clockwork mechanisms in the late 18th century gave rise to a number of clockwork assault rifles, the most famous of which was the Forgefire Repeater. The name itself was an exonym given to standard clockwork rifles paired with rune-enhanced incendiary rounds, though it was ultimately a fitting one, for these weapons truly put whomever was unfortunate enough to be caught in their fire through a crucible akin to a forge, with the only survivors being those able to withstand the heat and be tempered by the experience."
 dwarven_28_matchbeard_mortars:0 "Matchbeard Mortars"
 dwarven_28_matchbeard_mortarsDESCR:0 "Originally reserved for the backlines, mortars began to see increased use in the front lines of dwarven armies with shorter fuses and lighter frames compensating for their general unwieldiness. The operators of these new mortars were known as Matchbeards, mainly due to their odd appearances: embroidered beards with matches woven between each braid, so that regardless of the situation, a fuse could be lit."
 dwarven_30_gemstone_beamsplitters:0 "Gemstone Beamsplitters"
 dwarven_30_gemstone_beamsplittersDESCR:0 "A glorious symphony of rune magic and artificery, the dwarven beamsplitters represent the peak of dwarven magical weaponry. A damestear core designed to supply a number of mithril conductors with raw magical energy to pass a powerful beam of pure magic through an intricately-runecrafted gemstone. The beam's quality's could be changed by swapping the type of gemstone, or by modifying the facets to alter the beam's angle, power, or elemental resonance. Though lacking in pure power, its versatility is ultimately what made these mechanisms dominate the battlefield in the early 19th century."
 dwarven_30_mithrilcoat_infantry:0 "Mithrilcoat Infantry"
 dwarven_30_mithrilcoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Donning their metal coats once more, the legendary Steelcoats of old enjoyed a comfortable, lightweight upgrade in the form of mithril coats capable of deflecting both blade and bullet, with particular resistance to black damestear. It was Mithrilcoats that ultimately constituted the bulk of dwarven armies during the early 19th century, with their white coats quickly becoming a feared sight for all."

 dwarven_6_ram_riders:0 "Ram Riders"
 dwarven_6_ram_ridersDESCR:0 "Cavalry has never been a core contingent of dwarven armies due to their short stature and defensive orientation. In cases where an enemy army refuses to be broken the dwarven offensive is led by a shattering charge of warbred rams, often guaranteeing an enemy rout."
 dwarven_10_ramsteel_chargers:0 "Ramsteel Chargers"
 dwarven_10_ramsteel_chargersDESCR:0 "The reclamation of Orlazam-az-dihr and surrounding lands has brought forth the propagation of Ramsteel, an ancient metal thought to be lost to the Final Days. Its incredible strength combined with relatively light weight makes it the ideal metal to outfit ram rider regiments with. Though cavalry still made up an insignificant portion of most dwarven armies, it was this rediscovery that would maintain the ram's role into the future."
 dwarven_14_caverntrot_outriders:0 "Caverntrot Outriders"
 dwarven_14_caverntrot_outridersDESCR:0 "Cavalry's inability to effectively flank the enemy in tight caverns often forced combatants to exclude its use from battles. Such poor resource management was unbefitting of the dwarves, who would eventually, through a combination of selective breeding and refitted hooves, reintroduce the ram to cavern combat as an effective mainstay."
 dwarven_18_clockwork_ram_rangers:0 "Clockwork Ram Rangers"
 dwarven_18_clockwork_ram_rangersDESCR:0 "The resurgence of clockwork weaponry following the Reclamation gave rise to many odd contraptions and weapons, though none saw as much use as the Clockwork Rifle. The convenience of the loading and firing mechanisms combined with its relative light weight made these weapons a favorite of the dwarven ram riders, allowing the riders to maintain continuous fire even whilst handling a burly ram."
 dwarven_23_rune_dragoons:0 "Rune Dragoons"
 dwarven_23_rune_dragoonsDESCR:0 "Plated with enchanted ramsteel armor further enhanced with traditional runemagic, the Rune Dragoons were a terrifying sight on the battlefield. Boasting clockwork pistols and rune-enhanced steeds, the dragoons could swiftly enter combat with their repeating weaponry, cause as much havoc as possible, then leave to make way for the bulk of the frontline."
 dwarven_28_mecharams:0 "Mecha-Ram Cavalry"
 dwarven_28_mecharamsDESCR:0 "Rapid advancements in artificery and rune magic have given rise to the Mecha-Ram, a fully mechanical replacement for the rams typically seen carrying dwarven riders. These steel beasts do not flinch in the heat of battle, and with the ergonomics of the mount fully configurable, small stature was no longer a hindrance to potential cavalrymen. Overwhelming firepower may inspire fear in the enemy, but only the mecha-ram can truly bring the fight beyond the frontlines and run down a rout."

 emerald_orc_1_emerald_hordeDESCR:0 "While our warriors are loyal to their warlords regardless of what our dealings with the Fey are, the average warrior is unaffected by the fey magic, and remains orcish, and nothing more.

 emerald_orc_23_druidic_warriorsDESCR:0 "Ever since that first forest encounter, we have drawn power from the Fey, but now many among us are veritable druids, who can draw upon the Feyrealm's magic to their own ends. Because of the generally ritualistic nature of their magic, it is preferable that we do not risk losing them in battle in the front of our armies, as they are far more useful providing support from behind. When it comes down to it, however, all of these druids are warriors in their own right, and will employ their magic alongside their blades in combat."
 emerald_orc_26_archfey_warlocks:0 "Archfey Warlocks"
 emerald_orc_26_archfey_warlocksDESCR:0 "As we have become more deeply fey, we have moved beyond the need for druidic rituals, with many among us granted magic directly from the Feyrealm. It is unwieldy and chaotic, but undeniably powerful: those who can harness it tend to become part of Tugund-Darakh's elite, and they will be unstoppable when unleashed directly at our enemies."

 emerald_orc_28_wildsight_rangersDESCR:0 "Some of those blessed with the truesight may venture into the untrodden depths of the Deepwood, as if called by something. Those that return are not the same: they no longer just perceive all things around them, but also things that, according to others' eyes, are not there at all. Some respect these wildsight rangers as deeply Fey-touched, others simply call them mad, but all acknowledge they are scouts and ambushers with no parallel."

 eordand_1_court_knightsDESCR:0 "Following the splintering of the Eordan into the seasonal courts, each corner of the realm fell unto control of whoever was strongest. Whether through harnessing great magical power from the seasons themselves, or simply being the strongest warlord able to ward off such power, a warrior elite soon formed from the victors of this chaos. Armed and armored with the finest bronze and mounted upon antlered beasts, the elite of the court devotees fought as armored bulwarks and commanders in the heat of battle. Some, through their great devotion to their cause, were able to call upon the power of the seasons in battle to great effect."

 eordand_1_dusken_raidersDESCR:0 "Like flies drawn to rot, mercenaries and sellswords jockey for pay in battle and plunder thereafter. The wars between the seasonal courts brought death and devastation to the land and its people, inspiring great desperation. So-called Wild Riders, these lightly-armored and mobile miscreants are known to blaspheme in their trespasses into the Domandrod as hiding places. Their underhanded tactics have made them useful allies, often striking at the most vulnerable targets, even including medics and camp followers."

 eordand_1_ruin_garrisonDESCR:0 "With the constant wars that have plagued Eordand since the failure of Pelodan the First to reassert the authority of the Fey, fortifications around Precursor ruins have become an integral part of the landscape. The armies of the different states are typically formed out of soldiers who spend most of their time defending these fortifications, only leaving during wartime. When called upon for battles in the open field, the garrison forces would primarily form protective formations around groups of archers. Shield and spear units were preferred, being able to ward off enemy vollies, but were often vulnerable to powerful spellcasters and more mobile enemies."

Although he was unsuccessful in his quest, the many wars have lead to great experience among the Peitar clans. Across the varied landscape of Eordand, the remnants of Pelodan's cause adapt to the land. Whether at home in deep forests, across craggy hills or windswept plains, the Peitar warriors ever fight for a nigh-unwinnable cause with unending zeal.

Facing the brunt of the frigid northern winds and the Snecboth within, the forces of Eighard devoted their magical power to combating this threat. Wielding enchanted armor that wards off the cold, and arms that melt through the defensive ice of the Snecboth, the Thawswords of Darblath broke through the icy deadlock and further into the Randrunnse. The armies of Darblath, unlike traditional Autumn Court tactics, fought aggressively to root out hidden Snecboth and attempt to chase them encirclement."

Serving as the greatest defensive units, the Patina Guard was equipped with heavy plate and shields reaching from toe to eye, almost to the point of overencumberance. Typically outfitted with long spear rested upon grooves in the shields, the Patina Guard served as an impenetrable barrier upon the battlefield.

Most prized of all are the antlered beasts of the deep forests, raised with great care by the Dearktirans to be mighty warhorses. Almost twice the size of the common Eordan horse, the Dearktiran elk breed is so highly prized that they are often considered much better fed and housed than the common people.\n\nThe elk of Dearktir are not only known for their size.

Riding upon wild great elk and outfitted with concealing furs, the elite of Gelcolle swiftly patrolled the frozen forests unseen.

Separated from the mainland, the island of Einsagg proved to be an effective training ground for the new generation of warfare. Drilled with precision in formation tactics and outfitted with heavy armor and long spears, the Einsagg Legion prioritized defensive tactics. Building upon this traditional base, the Einsagg Legions were trained in amphibious assaults, as well as incorporating small companies of handgunners."

Lacking the tree cover of the vast forests, with sandstorms blowing in from the Egasach obscuring vision, and a general lack of water, the Trimgarb Peitar have held off invaders from their land for centuries. In times of peace, the Waterblades act as the upholders of the law, especially so with the usage of precious water. When Trimgarb is threatened with war, the Waterblades act as their elite scouts and infiltrators. Enemy patrols vanish in the craggy hills when they face the lacerating blades, and most famously the fortress of Serakriok was taken from within by the Waterblades."

With theories discussed and the latest prototype created at the laboratory, what remained would be to test the invention out in the field. Armed with the latest prototypes, specially trained soldiers would utilize them in battle under close scrutiny of the Arakepruni scholars.

Raithtall, most immediate to Dorcurt and having absorbed many of its survivors, vowed to reclaim Dorcurt at any cost. Over the years the Raithtall cavalry began to become more organized around religious orders sworn to Autumn and even the Gloam Knight. Wielding golden-hued armor with capes of leaves, as well as lances and swords infused with the vengeful fire of Autumn, the Vengeance of the Golden smote the enemies of Raithtall on their sworn quest."

Developed in Jhorgashirr to combat rival Tuathak armies from Eighard and Slegcal, the Jhorgashirran Square was composed of forward-facing gunners flanked by pikemen. Each face of the square could then be guarded by further pikemen, or swapped with gunners to fire in each direction. The center of each square was often designated as a temporary command post, manned with officers and mages. Most effective at taking down enemy formations in an open field, the square would not be suitable against skirmishing forces from the Snecboth or Peitar."

Utilizing specially designed firearms that would produce a jet of fire instead of launching a missile, at close range the Sunfire was shot at the enemy setting them and the ground around them ablaze. While effective at burning and causing widespread fear, the Sidparen Sunfire was limited by the availability of skilled mages or druids who could manipulate and augment the flames."

Finding battles at a stalemate with unmoving infantry blocks, the Arakepruni inventors created a weapon to allow cavalry to once more make an impact. Armed with smaller firearms such as pistols, the Arakepruni Caracole fired at the enemy at range whilst always being on the move.

Made into a round shape, Mirrorshields not only reflect the image of objects before it, but also have the ability to absorb the blow of musket shot and release it as heat.

Across the seas and beyond the desert of the Haraf, Urdea Samrad was established as a new beacon of Summer. Establishing their city in a tumultuous time between the arrival of the Cannorians and the despicable artificers, the Urdean Towerkeep were faced with immense difficulty to defend their new home.

Riding atop their magestic antlered beasts, the Domcolle Honorguard swore to defend their hall to the death, something ever more likely thanks to the seemingly unstoppable advance of the Tuathak. Firing from range with both rifle and pistols until the last shot, obscured by the frozen pines, their skull masks and icy lances were seen as agents of death... perhaps true if sent from the dreaded Immarel herself."

Braving choking smog and infernal contraptions, the Smogbane struck in the blink of an eye, quickly firing at unsuspecting artificers and leaving behind bombs.

Seeking to chart and discover undocumented Precursor ruins to study, the Expedition forces would often travel as small armies to occupy their worksites.

In a league of its own, the blade was stolen and taken to lands even further beyond the mountains to the east.\n\nDarran Eaglesthorn, ruler of Slegcal, set his sights on reclaiming Dracball. First invading the Dragon Dominion in 1782, the armies of Slegcal tore their way through the Ynnic Valley until finally reclaiming the sword in Arganjuzorn.

Einnsag valiantly rallied the Autumn Court against their invaders and stopped them both at Darblath and in the seas at the pivotal battle of Gathmarkosk. In the south, the Vanbury Guild seized the Fograc lands and Kairncal from Murdkather and Arakeprun. While once enemies, the Autumn, Spring, and Summer Courts vowed to drive out their enemies at all costs.

Partisans continued to fight against their occupation, continuing to practice the military traditions of Gemradcurt. The Boreal Dragoons served as the primary army of the Snecboth during the 18th century, armed with powerful carbines and mounted on quick elks.

Utilizing reworked Precursor magic, Coldsteel could be produced more easily in rituals requiring the effort of trusted mages. Well-suited for slicing through armor and weapons forged from lesser metals, cuirassiers armed with Coldsteel were invaluable at combating both enemy cavalry and infantry.

As the first row of soldiers fire, they swiftly squat and begin reloading their weapons as the row behind them fires immediately over their heads, thus mitigating downtime and allowing for constant volley after volley.

Regardless of how advanced, strict, and strenuous the drills became it was impossible for new recruits to match the skill of veteran soldiers. After many long years of research and testing, the artificers of the Dragon Command had created a solution to this eternal problem, the Warfare Simulator. Through an advanced system of illusions soldiers could be trained and drilled for any conceivable battlefield condition before ever seeing true combat. The simulation drill allowed the Great Command to mass produce fresh veterans."

By making use of semi-professional soldiers who trained extensively during the monsoon seasons, the Nadimraj ensured a high standard of quality and a large potential population from which to draw its soldiery. This system fell out of favor when the ascension of the harimari consolidated military service among the tigerfolk, but the growing strength of human Raheni kingdoms and the threat of the hobgoblins would see the practice reinstituted during the late 1300s and come into full bloom by the 1460s."

The 1500s would see several major changes come to Raheni armies - longer pikes spread as they proved their efficacy not only against harimari chargers and war elephants but jaddari cavalry and warg riders. Unit sizes grew, taking advantage of the larger recruitable population, and flexible hobgoblin formations were adopted to allow fast redeployment of fresh men across the field."

These conditions attracted many fine military minds, including those fleeing chaos in the north, and saw a blossoming of new tactics among the Slave Knights of Bhuvauri. Though they had far less combat experience than their northern cousins, the Sarniryasbadi fielded refined, well drilled infantry with uniform equipment, troops unhindered by the exhaustion and desperation that plagued the Shamakhadi."

 raheni_12_khedarid_infantryDESCR:0 "When the Ruin Kingdoms fell and the Raj-Command wars began, the Rasarhids stood on the front-line against the hobgoblins. The Rasarhid favored a small, heavily armored infantry core supported by a large number of archers and early arquebusiers, who served as the true killing power of the army. Devastating volleys of arrows would prompt the enemy to approach strongly defended positions, where they would meet a solid wall of steel and will. Rasarhid infantry became famous for their rigid stoicism, holding formation even in the face of terrible odds, and though their static formations were inflexible they were among the most difficult forces in Rahen to rout."

 raheni_15_bhuvauri_squareDESCR:0 "Mass integration of blackpowder was a slow process throughout Rahen, though the Bhuvauri took to the practice faster than most. Building on their traditions of a well-drilled force, Sarniryasbadi Arquebusiers combined with strong pike formations deployed on barges along the Kharunyana to unleash withering fire on approaching enemies. These musketeers formed the backbone of the armies that fought the hobgoblins to a standstill in the Great Dhujat War. Though they lacked the ferocity of the harimari or mastery of the elves, the Bhuvauri were perhaps the most crucial element of the coalition, creating a wall of pike and shot that matched the discipline of the Hobgoblins and halted the Command in its tracks at the walls of Khiraspid."

Almost entirely abandoning traditional infantry as the musket proliferated and grew common in the foothills, as much as 80% of Ghankedhen armies would be armed with muskets by 1600. By leaving the bow behind entirely, the Ghankedhen would make the first major step in bringing Raheni armies fully into the era of Blackpowder."

Among these unwilling travelers were veterans of the Dhujat War, deprived of the lands granted to them for retirement. With no soil to till, these veteran legionaries flocked to the armies of the Bhuvauri, the Porcelain Cities, and the western Bom States, forming an elite corps of exiles hell-bent on reclaiming their homes."
 raheni_23_nadimraj_musketeers:0 "Nadimraj Musketeers"
 raheni_23_nadimraj_musketeersDESCR:0 "The most major leap forward in the development of Raheni infantry was the combination of Ghankedhen blackpowder units with the permanent armies of the Bhuvauri and mass-mobilization techniques of the Nadimraj. During the monsoon months conscripted reserves would practice their musket accuracy alongside professional soldiers. With months of dedicated practice each year, Raheni farmers became surprisingly accurate with firearms, and a valuable resource that could swell the ranks of Raheni armies to huge numbers of capable infantry, rapidly trained in soldiering by the professionals alongside whom they had practiced."

The ensuing explosive barrage would shatter formations, or open them up to an even more devastating second barrage, followed by either a volley of gunfire, or the roar of charging orcs."

When the Jadd brought Verkal Gulan into its light, and later Seghdihr to its knees, the Black Orcs of the Middle Dwarovar took notice as their age-old foes were brought to heel. When the first missionaries arrived, there was tension, and often violence, but from these elves a truth was soon revealed. Learning from the strong is not a weakness. It is a necessity. With our own soldiers humbled so thoroughly, all that remained was the drive to adapt. Adapt our guns, adapt our lines, adapt the heads of dwarves into the ground. The Jaddari missionaries taught us many things, and with this newfound knowledge, Black Orcs have become a semi-modern fighting force."

Longer barrels meant longer range, which ultimately translated to more volleys before melee. Though this departure from tradition left many orcs alienated, the results could simply not be ignored, ultimately reshaping Black Orcish military doctrine into a model similar to that of the Green Orcs of Cannor."

Faced with extinction or change, many chose change. This took the form of the Roadprowlers. Inspired by the warband of old, a Roadprowler Division is a logistical building block from which the modern Black Orcish army is built upon. With black and grey coats to help obscure them in the darkness of the caves from their enemies, Roadprowlers have equipped themselves with dwarven-inspired weaponry, such as repeaters or rifled muskets, usually raided from felled foes, but also made in growing quantity and quality by orcish hands."

The regenerative properties of troll flesh are well known, and the troll is kept and "harvested" for flesh which is grafted onto existing enslaved trolls. The culmination of this is a small army of Dire Trolls; trolls that have been mutated and grafted together to create a monstrosity just as likely to eat the Dire Troll beside it as they are to eat the warband's enemies."

Regardless, these packs can be dominated and gained control of, either by shamans and magical enslavement, or simply beating the animals into shape and a taskmaster establishing themselves as the leader of the pack.

In battle, archers would be massed into one large formation to fire salvos of arrows at their enemies until their quivers were empty.

Her retinue would be named the Skull-Cross Ravagers, named for their skull-motifs painted throughout their equipment (armour, helmets, and even faces). The Ravagers would often be kept in reserve in intense pitched battles, before being sent out as the vanguard of a second wave of gnolls against the exhausted adversary, with spiked clubs in their hands, daggers between their teeth, and rabid hunger in their hearts.

Such a piercing cacophony often flows through the desert air, filling the ears of both elves and humans with an eerie dread before the tension is broken by flurries of arrows. Following this deadly barrage, the gnolls emerge from the dunes, cackling loudly before attacking the stragglers in melee combat. This encirclement strategy, combined with such a distinct, piercing battlecry, became infamous in the early years of the Age of Unravelling from the hills of Bulwar to the seas of Rahen."

Throughout the zenith years of the Age of Unravelling, gnolls began to implement complex manoeuvres among their units to effectively fight drilled gunpowder armies. Simple strategic goals were issued from pack commanders to their many lieutenants to carry out however they pleased, with success being rewarded and the prospect of promotions and bonus loot and failure punishable by death (often by kin-cannibalism or ritualistic sacrifice). As a result of this vicious meritocracy, only the most competent and loyal lieutenants remained, who proved to be capable at leading smaller warhosts to outflank, outmanoeuvre, and outsmart the Pack's many enemies at the tactical level."

However, one of its most sought exports was the Cannorian handgonne, which would proliferate throughout the gnollish population for its thundering noise and ease of manufacturing. Gnolls would modify the handgonnes by shortening and widening the barrel, allowing for multiple shots to be stuffed into the gonne to be fired simultaneously. Due to the successful but monstrous brutality of such firearms, human and elven scribes would spitefully dismiss them in their literature to mask their shame and fear of dying to such crude weapons in the hands of gnolls."

Gnolls would develop a pike-and-shot strategy, arming half of their host with matchlocks and the other half with fire-lances with identical face paints to the musketeers. Generals would lead their armies into the pikewalls, deceived by such a simple misdirection, while the wise would send skirmishers to challenge the pikemen, only for them to be scorched by belching flames from the pikemen at close range before being slaughtered. In reality, the dubious quality of such fire-lances often undermined this novel strategy, as the fire-lances were mocked for frequently spreading burning tar, fat, and sulphur within gnollish formations instead."

This was exasperated by increasing restlessness from the slaves as news of the gnolls' defeats in raids became widespread. In a desperate effort to stem the threat of rebellion, and to adapt to the shifting tides of war, gnolls began to offer worthy slaves freedom in exchange for military service. Pressed into slave battalions, these soldiers would be simply drilled to operate "imported" (scavenged, stolen, salvaged) firearms before being integrated into battle-ready packs for future raids. Poor training, supplies, and leadership from their pack mistresses guaranteed that many of these "soldiers" would be condemned to early graves, never laying eyes upon the freedom promised to them."

However, an increasing proliferation of firearms through raiding and enslaved craftsmen capable of spreading the art to their gnollish masters ensured a modest supply of marginally acceptable firearms. In a bastardization of modern Jaddarin drill, gnolls would form into "boomstick lines" and fire an unholy salvo of shrapnel and fire before charging into the fray of the weakened opponents' formations. Though effective against inexperienced levies and garrison troops in the borderlands they raided, the gnolls would often shatter their teeth upon any formation of drilled line infantry and retreat into their homeland."

Many of them had an affinity for magic and were capable of imbuing weapons with demonfire, unquenchable and hungry flames summoned from the depths themselves. When firearms were introduced into the Salahad, shamans were encouraged to bless guns with demonic rituals, allowing their shots to be demonfire conductors. Throughout the Age of the Witchkings, powerful gnollish leaders would equip their most loyal and zealous gnolls with demonic blunderbusses and bullet-resistant plate armour which resembled the scales of ancient dragons.

Goblinfire, an esoteric compound from the ports of Aqatbar, was introduced to the gnolls during the Age of the Witchkings through trade with the Overclan. This black concoction would be funnelled into canisters before being ignited by a slow-burning match, then ejected through an air-powered hose, producing a constant stream of hellish fire. Although such contraptions were too heavy to be used in pitched battle in the Salahedesi, gnollish lieutenants would use these flamespitters in an exhibit of power, intimidating enemy garrisons and rebel holdouts with the threat of painful and slow immolation."

Iron-cast grenades, blessed by the shamans, became the iconic weapon of the Fleshroast Brigades for their devastating power against any material. Projected with specially-crafted staff slings, these grenades could fly hundreds of feet in the air before exploding under the feet of the enemy, butchering and roasting their flesh alive or above their heads, showering them with shrapnel and demonic fireballs.

As such, gnollish firearms were often designed for either hunting or guaranteeing that close-quarters-combat would happen, allowing for warriors to immerse themselves in the carnage and bloodshed. One such wretched invention was the volley-gun, a multi barreled flintlock musket which would fire a volley's worth of shots simultaneously, tearing any unfortunate souls apart at close range.

Admired for their high rate of fire and accurate lethality, gnollish artificers would replicate their design; although these copies would lack the exquisite Dwarven craftsmanship and detail.

Originally designed to hunt large game and to defend raiding ships from oncoming marines, the blunderbuss became a popular weapon-of-choice for its brutal damage and its ability to fire two independent shots before reloading. Gnolls would use these firearms primarily to easily tear open supply carriages, lightly-armoured infantry, and the doors of unfortunate households before seizing the loot and captives; threatening their prey with the wrath of another devastating barrage loaded in the second barrel."

In gnollish military strategy, sappers were often sent first to establish temporary fieldworks and to identify weak points in the enemy fortress; this strategy often resulted in many gnollish sappers cluelessly stepping into kill-zones, being slaughtered by the defenders in the process. By the dawn of the Age of Artificers, gnollish commanders would start issuing sappers with greenflame launchers, heavy flamethrowers that could launch concentrated fireballs at enemy garrisons. Mounted upon fieldworks or even on sandy dunes, gnollish sappers would be able to threaten defenders with immolation from afar, allowing for the gnolls to hypothetically advance without any opposition to fulfil tactical objectives."

In spite of these flaws, the 2-gauge shotgun would be adopted into gnollish military strategy. Gnollish companies would implement pin-and-flank tactics, wherein skirmishers would pin down enemy units with accurate rifle-fire from advantageous terrain to allow the 2-Gauge shotgun crews to flank deep into enemy lines unchecked, firing canister shots to disembowel the pinned enemy units. The skirmishers would then charge forwards, slaughtering the stragglers in melee combat.

Consisting of two canisters filled with greenfire and pressurised air, the flamespitter was operated by squeezing a lever, which would cause the pressurised air to force the greenfire out through a nozzle, spewing a jet of hellish flames up to 15 metres far.

 elven_12_mixed_shot_phalanxDESCR:0 "Though elves are widely regarded as late adopters of the firearm, very limited arquebus integration was well underway by the mid-1500s. Elfrealms with high levels of interaction with humans, such as that of Moonhaven, would ultimately make this change earlier than those favoring a position of isolation, such as those sequestered away in the forests of Lencenor. The Mixed Shot Phalanx was an elven variation of the traditional pike and shot in which younger and less experienced elves made up the front of the formation, whilst elders and veterans would fire upon the enemy from relative safety within the square. This would mark a divergence from traditional elven combat: a product of gradual Cannorian assimilation over the course of five centuries."

 elven_15_crossfire_tri_squadronsDESCR:0 "Still refusing the drudgery of conventional human warfare, moon elves would, at the turn of the 17th century, develop small squad units known as ‘triplets', which would utilize centuries of organizational drill to quickly assemble and retreat, allowing for far more complicated formations than the human pike-and-shot could muster. One such formation was the Trinaitéin sína Proia, which Cannorians deemed a mouthful and simply called it the Tri-Squadron Crossloose, in which dozens of triplets would organize themselves into two halves of a line, each half slightly angled towards the other, primarily wielding traditional elven longbows, with some possessing token sidearms. The resulting crossloose would render most common field fortifications ineffective, ensuring that oncoming arrows arrive at inconvenient and varied angles."

Though Varivar would ultimately be dissolved during the Fourth Lilac War, the Marín Company would live on in the form of the Varivar Free Marines, providing an example and blueprint for other coastal Elfrealms to conduct amphibious warfare.

 elven_19_icewind_expeditionariesDESCR:0 "Heavily rooted in tradition and suffering from middling birthrates, elves in Cannor ultimately failed to solve the primary underlying issue of any elf-based military: manpower. Elves are relatively few and far between, and with each elf lost, centuries of knowledge, experience, and prowess are lost as well, making our casualties far more difficult to replace than our enemies'. The Elfrealm of Celmaldor ultimately decided to integrate human auxiliaries into the army in an unprecedented display of pragmatism, led by elven officers in independent regiments. Though this solved their crippling manpower concerns, this transition was reversed within several decades due to the overall poor quality of the human levies in use, and elven armies remained primarily elven from then on."

 elven_19_pistol_dancersDESCR:0 "Though faring surprisingly well on the modern battlefield, the ancient art of diranbe has largely given way to firearm-based combat. Originating in Blaíddscal, a modern adaptation of diranbe, known as pistol dancing, first saw use in the early-17th century in Ibevari ceremonial combat, later seeing use in both Ibevari and Aldresian armies. The art of pistol dancing revolves around a pair of ornamental daggers with small flintlock receivers and barrels etched into the sides of their handguards, running up the side of the blade. The resulting weapon had similar utility to traditional diranbe, eschewing the art's focus on magic in return for the universal firepower of blackpowder. Though inaccurate, the pair of daggers would be wielded to deadly effect through a flurry of slashes and shots, a swiftness and elegance akin to dancing."
 elven_23_velocity_infantry:0 "Velocity Infantry"
 elven_23_velocity_infantryDESCR:0 "Though many view the elves as late adopters of the firearm, this could be farther from the truth. The effectiveness of line infantry comes from the endless drive for perfection, where it be movement or the motion of reload - and no other force in the world can match the elves in such pursuits.\n\nThe only factor for the elves was time, and when the old guard died, they were replaced by elves who had trained in the way of powder and shot for the last two hundred years. Even the most skilled Cannorian regiments can typically only fire three volleys per minute, with some elite units managing four. For the common elf, five is the minimum. Such is the name: velocity."

 elven_23_new_moonDESCR:0 "Throughout the ages, elves have developed a series of formations based on the moon and its phases, and just as the moon's appearance shifts, so too do elven formations. A Full Moon represents a standard volley line, while a New Moon is more akin to the guerilla warfare elves are more known for. Any middle ground between these two formations is a crescent, with waxing crescents transitioning into full line volleys, and waning crescents transitioning into irregular warfare as a formation crumbles. Utilizing the natural dexterity and discipline of the elves, formations can bleed into one another formlessly, and individual parts of the line can even break off into lesser moons if the situation necessitates it."

 elven_28_waning_crescentDESCR:0 "With the advent of black damestear bullets alongside the far deadlier rifle, standard line formations became far too costly in lives for elven militaries. Starting in the mid-18th century, moon elven military doctrine began to favor starting engagements in a Waning Crescent formation, which was a curved frontline poised to purposefully collapse and transition to guerilla warfare the moment the battle became too dangerous to continue. The transition to irregular combat was near-seamless, leaving the enemy in a relative state of disarray and affording precious time to regroup."

Time weathers all, and amidst a far more hostile world, the Gladeguards of old were forced to adapt. Donning magical camouflage and equipped with elven-made artisan muskets passed down from their forebears, these rangers are uniquely adapted to forest terrain and continue to use their agility to their advantage–and to the dismay of any who dare to enter the glades uninvited."

 elven_30_two_field_formationDESCR:0 "There is an old elven proverb: "the enemy should suffer through two fields of ambush before facing an elven army." With magical communication and artificery-enhanced longbows, this proverb has become reality. With a natural advantage in traversing rough terrain, elven armies can effectively lead an enemy through several unfavorable skirmishes through false engagements and strategic retreats. Once the main battle begins, the enemy will have to contend with a Waning Crescent equipped with modern rifles, and if possible, the earlier skirmishers will begin to cause havoc in the enemy's backline, preventing reorganization and regrouping. Such is the elven way of fighting: not one life lost in vain."

It is these songs that we choose to sing to our soldiers, emboldened through emulation of the late heroine Istralania Warsinger, bane of the Sorcerer-King and leader of the Istralari Banshees. Melodies of grief and bloodshed, but also ones of perseverance, tenacity, and new life. The new life that our soldiers choose to protect.\n\nThus, songs unpleasant to the ear shall be sung time and time again.

The riders usually carried bows and javelins, which they used to wreak havoc among gnollish ranks. They incessantly harassed the enemy, attacking and quickly retreating before they could respond, exhausting them physically and psychologically. Usually these bands were independent from the state, and would be hired by it or by particulars to perform raids into gnollish territory or eliminate troublesome packs.

The warriors took advantage of their knowledge of the terrain to ambush enemy troops, and charged at them with spear in hand. Meanwhile harpy troops carrying bows would fire in quick succession as they flew around their foes, quickly overwhelming them with this multidirectional attack.

The riders carried pikes with which they would charge if considered necessary, but their primary weapon was a long range musket. Once at range they would dismount the camel and place themselves behind it, using it as an improvised barricade.

After a few decades, however, he determined that he had created the "perfect breed", and quickly lost interest in the subject. While Aakhet would move on, the military capabilities of the new breed were not overlooked by Aramoole's high staff. The Aakhephita, meaning Dragon Horse in Kheteratan, are a quick and resilient breed, able to maintain a significant speed during long periods of time. They were the preferred mount of the elite cavalry troops of Aramoole. Carrying muskets with bayonets, these troops used the horses mainly for transportation, dismounting when they reached the enemy. If the situation turned dire they could quickly mount and retreat, as no mount in Sarhal could outrun the Aakhephita."

Neither the soldiers nor the animal carried any armor, as to not further burden the camel with the weight. Instead, they brought along two muskets. The soldier in the front would shoot at the enemy before passing the now discharged musket to his companion. In return, the second soldier would pass the second weapon before reloading the first one."

The soldier would usually dismount before firing, although some versions allowed a skilled rider to shoot while the animal moved. The destructive capability of these units was enormous, while also enjoying significant mobility. Over the ensuing decades, more experimental takes on the concept were also designed by ambitious artificers, but they were all too unreliable or expensive to be used in significant quantities. These included a camel mounted with a crude prototyped gatling gun, a camel carrying a fireball thrower and, appearing only in the design plans of an anonymous artificer and with no evidence of actual use at any time, a camel with what appeared to be a laser cannon."

Ancient Ynnics regarded the Posvleadi, "Netherfolk", as fearless nose-less demons with a deep knowledge of the terrain, but by the sixteenth century most memories of them had morphed into fairytales.

While the "shot" part of the pike & shot formation was outlawed in most Ynnic realms, that didn't stop homesteader armies from deploying it, and the Rzentur armies would only cease to use this version of it when they finally passed to all-musket armies."

 ynnic_19_trompolere_rangersDESCR:0 "The Sarda were the first Ynnic people to experience gunpowder warfare in all its destructivity, and this made them pursue more efficient usages of the bow. Levying hunters was no longer considered sufficient, and lords began scheduling drilling sessions in preparation of - or even during - wars. The techniques that arose during these drills, first developed in Trompolere camps, allowed the common troops to loosen three arrows at once - either in multiple directions, or concentrated on the same target."

The final model, known as Adirbor, was a repeating crossbow shooting multiple daggers at high speed. While normally overkill, it proved greatly effective against the Cursed Ones. A company of Brelari crossbows participated to the defense of Amacimst against Cursed Ones besiegers, and, for their remarkable kill-count, they were dubbed "Crossbowmasters of Amacimst" by Lord Gelendirn III."

As legendary as the Companions' fame, are the disparate weapons and armour-pieces they wield, so effective, they are rumored by Cannorians to be Precursor Relics. During the Age of Witch-Kings the Companions were at the apex of their strength, so confident of their power they would slowly march towards the enemy lines, unflinching under musket fire as their magic deflected all projectiles, and when they reached the enemy they would effortlessly cut them all down."

Rilsean Wardens, named after the Sarda word for "Kingdom", were a heterogeneous force of full-time fighters and spellcasters, serving as the middle step between feudal and standing armies. While their choice of weapon varied, they were most commonly outfitted with enchanted spears and shields bearing the coat of arms of their realm, as well as an enchanted mail-and-plate armour."

 ynnic_26_dismounted_ynnic_knightsDESCR:0 "Despite the nobility and prestige associated with their steed, Ynnic Knights were no strangers to fighting on foot. Before stirrups were adopted, most knights would in fact dismount and fight on foot during prolonged battles, and this role became prominent again during the late Age of Witch-Kings, thanks to the inspiration provided by Malacnar Companions. Dismounted Ynnic Knights or "Nohy Vytrie" were those knights who entered the battle already on foot, and they were most commonly last-born sons or lesser nobility, serving as elite infantry to rally the other troops and provide the mainstay of the Ynnic battle line. Donning full body armour and wielding greatswords, they slowly but surely advanced towards the enemy lines, deflecting enemy bullets from a distance. And once they were close enough to see their enemies eye to eye, they would dash towards them right before they could reload."

Nicknamed "Drozmateers" by Cannorian merchants, these warriors were far scarier than their nickname made them out to be, as was the mass fire coming out of their green, dragonscale-like bladed muskets. In the Rzentur's signature combination of savagery and religious zeal, they formed a tactic that had alternating members of the line fire whilst the others charged at the enemy."

Teira battle style is an extension of their lifestyle: small, secretive bands who scrape by while doing their best not to draw attention, but capable, if cornered, to set lethal ambushes against their would-be hunters. Having arrived to the Ynn thanks to a secret pathway through the Forest of the Cursed Ones known only to them, Teira were outfitted with weapons such as crossbows, spears and throwing daggers of a far higher quality than anything they were used to, but even under the service of Ynnic Lords they still continued wearing the same camouflage-painted fur coats their brethren did in Dalaire. This attire favoured their primary task: irregular warfare, skirmishes, ambushes and supply train disruption, providing a response to the frontiermen's own asymmetrical warfare and developing a fame as hunters of men second only to Wendigos. The sight of the Teira's glowing eyes staring at you from the woods was enough to send common troops into a panic."

Discipline was enforced, and the previous Drozmateer tactic of charging at will into enemy lines was abolished; Gospodh Aranthiv deemed it "Improper of a modern army". Rather, platoon fire was developed, so that the Dominion's "mouths of fire" could keep "roaring" constantly in all moments of the battle."

 ynnic_30_longbow_knightsDESCR:0 "To Ynnic Knights, the crossbow was seen as a devious device to fabricate strength, the shortbow was the weapon of lowly woodsmen and the composite bow was for bandits. But the longbow? Ynnic Knights admired the Damerian longbow, which required strength and years of training to use. Imported in the nineteenth century, it quickly became one of their favourite tools when out hunting. At the battle of Velencestor in 1811 400 knights fought in the frontline as heavily-armoured foot archers, and their arrows, glowing blue with magic, rained destruction on the enemy musketeer lines by buzzing through several men or exploding upon landing. The future Empress Morvel was leading these archers, having been the one to perfect those magical arrows during her exile in Veykoda. By her campaign's end, the Vytrie Rongukol - Longbow Knights - had grown into a 1000-strong regiment, and more were commissioned during her reign. Veykodan rune magic was applied to both the bows and armour of the knights, with carvings in elegant patterns that enhanced not only the beauty, but also the performance of their equipment. The longbows, with largest surface area of all types of bow, were optimal for rune magic."

True to their factionalist indole, there were two different Tuathak Foreign Legions of which one served the Dragon Dominion, the other the new Sarda Empire. While those of the Dragon Dominion unleashed the power of Eordand's new deadly magirifles, those under the Sarda Empire were infamous for slowly starving their prisoners to death before throwing their bodies into the river, and in battle they wielded poison-laced copper swords similar to Dracball, the sword of Artorean the Dragonslayer, with an obvious message."

Given a light chainmail and a overhand lance, all Ynnic Squires need to do is keep hold of their horse, and steer the magnificient beast as it does most of the job on its own goring and trampling the enemies to death."

And why invest all your money into heavy plate armour for yourself, when you needed mobility in order to acrobatically jump off anyway? Due to their proximity to the ironhouses of Brelar, Dolindhan knights were the first to be able to afford horse armour consistently, and they often overlayed it with cloth in the colour of their suzerain's emblem.

These Draconic Knights were outfitted in a green, Balgaric-style spiked armour that made them betray no emotion, and, as they traced their lineage to the Dragon-God himself through their Rzentur side, their dragon blood allowed them to wield powerful magic: magic that made them impervious to anything short of a cannonball."

In order to get enough goblins for his war against Birzartanšes and Baharkand, Perzuk, chief of the Marbleheads, promised loot and land for those who would follow him into battle, and thousands of goblins and humans alike took up his offer. While not particularly well armed or organized, Perzuk's forces were both plentiful and motivated."

Instead, goblins armed with shortbows along major caravan routes laid in wait for oncoming caravans. They would then emerge and fire dozens of arrows into the caravanners, killing them before they could flee or strike back. Eventually, the Greysheeps would also use these highly experienced and surprisingly accurate warriors for battles, where they would earn their name after a small force of 200 goblins with shortbows held a hilltop for 6 hours against thousands of Gelkar soldiers."

The warriors of the Mountainhuggers are well known for their skill in navigating the mountains of their homelands and are highly agile for goblins. During the wars against the alliance of Re-Uyel, Crathanor, and Ovdal Tûngr, roving bands of Mountainhuggers would travel the hills and mountains of Bahar, destroying or pillaging everything in their wake before the Bahari could find them."

At first, the cost limited its use to only the most elite of troops such as the personal guard of the chief of the Landsharks, but goblin blacksmiths soon began producing crude copies in huge numbers, allowing for massed formations armed with guns. Although the guns had a rather high chance to explode in the user's face and lacked all semblance of proper accuracy, they still proved remarkably deadly, especially against the Bulwari and Sun Elves who had not yet embraced gunpowder warfare."

Many of Perzuk's volunteers had already retired by then, and their children lacked the ambition of their forefathers. As such, the Marbleheads had to extend the same offer to their human subjects, and though a large amount took it, they only begrudgingly accepted the idea of fighting alongside goblins, who they consider spawns of the Malevolent Dark. Fights, thievery, and murder were common in mixed units, but mixed units were rather effective in battle as the strengths and weaknesses of the humans and goblins complemented each other and showed the potential for continuing such tactics if morale issues could be fixed."

Seeing this, the Overclan decided to completely dissolve all human-only and goblin-only units and merge them. In battle, the Union Formations sent forth goblin skirmishers and human riders ahead of the main column to scout and harass the enemy before the main column arrived and annihilated the enemy with thunderous volleys of matchlocks."

This orange-colored gemstone, found only in Bulwar and surrounding regions, is prized by the Sun Cults, and for good reason. If left under full sunlight for more than six hours, it would shine in the darkness and repel certain undead creatures. However, artificers and priests in the Overclan found that when charged with magical energy, sunstones could be turned into a kind of grenade that would shine with a power akin to the sun for a few moments upon being thrown, turning everything in close proximity into ashes. All Jadd soldiers in the Overclan were issued a couple of charged sunstone gems, but there were specialized units who were issued with vast quantities of sunstone to rain the power of the sun upon the enemy."

The mixture was placed in steel tanks that would launch the volatile sludge using pressurized air and nozzles. The government of the Overclan immediately hired the rogue tinkerers and gave them the funds to set up a production complex. These flamers, as they were called, were issued to only the bravest of soldiers who were called Flame Sappers and given thick armor to protect them from both their weapon and enemy fire, since they had to advance to very close range to use their flamethrowers."

However, this changed when the Ancardian-trained Bulwari officer Ashur Zamuraš was appointed commander of the army tasked with guarding the frontier with the Harpylen Queendom. He immediately began reorganizing the regiments under his command to have an equal number of goblins and humans, enforcing a high standard of conduct among his men. He also placed a high amount of importance on firing discipline, forcing both human and goblin soldiers, who previously simply fired whenever their guns were loaded, to coordinate their volleys. When his superiors in Aqatbar saw this, they immediately had Zamuraš appointed as Chief of the Army so that he could spread his methods across the Overclan."

Thus the first iteration of the Sunscorch Handcannon was produced. This highly innovative and extraordinarily dangerous weapon fired a kind of goo, named sunplasm due to its similarity in texture to ectoplasm, which could burn through just about anything. Sunplasm is produced by heating air to very high temperatures with a Damestear crystal, but because it could melt most known alloys, this process was required to happen within the handcannon. This meant that if the process failed in any way, it was the user's life that paid the price."

While nearly all proposals used explosives in some way, one stood out. Proposed by the military engineer Aminkle Picktooth, it consisted of using powerful explosives to artificially create landslides, burying the enemy in tons of rubble and dirt and blocking the passage of reinforcements. This strategy was put to the test during a border skirmish with Ourdians in 1702, where it worked wonderfully, with hundreds of Ourdians buried beneath smoldering rock. Brokenhammer was rewarded richly, and the Landslide Corps was officially established just a few weeks later."

As expected, the inventions that intrigued them the most were Sunplasm and Goblinfire. They meticulously studied these odd weapons, and to the horror of the rest of Bulwar, actually improved them. They combined the flamethrower with Goblinfire and created a terrifyingly powerful flamethrower that shoots Sunplasm by adding magical wards to the nozzle, pipe, and Flame Sapper armor so that it could withstand the heat of a constant stream of sunplasm. They were named False-Suns, after the incredibly destructive power that the weapon released."

Even the False-Sun flamethrower could not sate their desire for infernal destruction, so they continued to make more and more deadly flamespitters. It was with the advent of the 19th century that they created the ultimate weapon to harness fire in the form of the appropriately named Sunwielders. These humans and goblins are clad in 2-meters tall Damestear-powered exosuits bristling with weapons. In both hands it holds flaming greatswords and in its wrists are False-Sun flamethrowers. On one of its shoulders there is either a device made of lenses that reflects and magnifies the burning heat of the sun into the enemy, on its other shoulder is a gigantic sunstone cannon which fires chunks of sunstone the size of human heads, capable of annihilating concrete walls. Its faceplate is a blank piece of gilded steel with two eyeholes burning with magefire (which can also be used as a weapon), contrasting with the rest of the mech which is the color of ash and lead. These mechanical avatars of divine wrath are thankfully extremely rare, with just slightly more than a hundred in existence due to the immense amount of money and effort that goes into the creation of just a single one, but when they are deployed, nothing can stop them."

A single immolator could cause unparalleled havoc on the battlefield, and until higher-calibre rounds were developed, were near-invincible in conventional warfare. Unfortunately for the Overclan, their enemies soon learned that, despite being free from conventional logic, the immolator was not immune to the laws of physics, and exerted a massive amount of weight upon the ground it tread. As such, it was entirely unusable on difficult terrain or soil softened by rainwater.

When the orcs arrived, however, the ceremonial glaives were taken off the walls, sharpened, and put to deadly use against the invaders.

That simple design has been iterated upon many, many times, however, and several more iterations happened in the outside world while the Wood Elves were isolated by the Verdant Veil. When contact was established with the outside world, these improved bows, while first met with skepticism, soon became the most popular import.

The brutality of the Emeraldtide changed this.\n\nThe Emerald Orcs did not budge against stag rider charges nor did they falter under their light missile fire.

Thus, with these larger armies, new tactics were devised to better coordinate the salla with one another.\n\nThe most utilized of these was the Wooden Wall, or Muyr Prayn, which was a tight defensive formation behind intermittent lines of large, enchanted wooden shields. The elves would pepper approaching enemies with arrows until they reached the first prayn (wall), at which point the shields and bows of the first line were dropped, and they would set upon their enemies with glaives. After a short attack, they would fall back behind the second prayn, at which point the strategy was repeated."

Empowered to take the initiative, these groups would then independently carry out evasive movements, flanking attacks, and seize advantageous terrain as needed to pressure the enemy.

To most of Wood Elven society, druids were simply hermits who occasionally helped the sick and needy. This, however, would come to an end in the late 1500s.\n\nThe prosperity and unity of Cyranvar meant disparate settlements had grown into towns and cities. Scattered druids began to come together as druidic circles. Education was standardized, taking inspiration from the Magisterium.

While they were still required to buy their own equipment, these elves were left plenty of coin in the pocket while also allowing the purchase of quality imported arms. The generous pay, along with lingering clan ties, would also cause a steady trickle of experienced Ceannasaí infantry to return to their salla, providing a valuable cadre of officers.\n\nTaken together, salla forces transformed into an able, if irregular, auxiliary force which relied on individual skill capitalized by competent leadership.

Taking inspiration from Salla Ayeth and other southern clans of old, direct confrontation was avoided in favor of steady attrition. It was a deadly tactic, only made bloodier by modern developments. Firearms ensured that, unlike the bow, any elf could be a fighter regardless of experience. Meanwhile, rebel druids ensured that no creature could be taken for granted, as loyalists made their advances.

However, these strengths also made it inflexible to change. When the battlefield shifted from one of direct confrontation to one of asymmetric warfare, new lessons would have to be learned.

Luckily an answer would appear during the turn of the 18th century: "feysteel".\n\nNot only was it as light as old oakshields and far more durable, feysteel could be forged domestically, making it economical to employ. That it also provided a form of light camouflage thanks to its hues of green color only made it all the better for stag riders."

 wood_elf_26_saisthDESCR:0 "For all their fame, the rangers of Cyranvar were never intended to become the elite units they are today. A byproduct of the compromise between Faevir and the salla, the rangers were instead formed to act as a joint national guard between Cyranvar and the reconciled clans.\n\nIn exchange for permanently disbanding their armies, the salla, not the state, would be empowered to train this new force. However, to ensure the rangers' loyalties remained detached from any one salla, Faevir would ensure this training was not localized to a single clan. From the secrets of stag bonding in Fealgarn to the stealthy stalking of Cenág to the fey whispering of Drennen, an elf could only become a ranger by mastering every clan's ways."

 wood_elf_26_verdantcoat_infantryDESCR:0 "For all of his pride, Faevir Vaytcothyd recognized Cyranvar's survival was nothing short of a miracle after successive calamities that were the elven civil war, orcish rebellion and Soyzkaru Cartel intervention. That survival had been more thanks to deft diplomacy and foreign mercenaries than to the army he had built up.\n\nIt was clear drill and discipline alone were not enough to face Cyranvar's enemies. Flexibility, in the form of officers capable of reacting to the moment and making split decisions, was needed. Officers who sought to understand not only Wood Elven military thought but also Escanni, and controversially, Cartel thought too. Those willing to meet that challenge would be well rewarded and distinguished by a verdant green uniform."
 wood_elf_28_cyfelim_saisth:0 "Cyfelim Sàisth"
 wood_elf_28_cyfelim_saisthDESCR:0 "Cyfelim sàisth, swift rangers in Common, were first formed at the end of the 18th century as a specialized branch of mounted rangers, a direct response to the Soyzkaru Cartel's mechanical monstrosities. Trained not only in the ranger tradition but also in the ways of Gommo artificery, the swift rangers' sole purpose was to break both goblin machine and spirit.\n\nTo do this, rangers were deployed well behind enemy lines and territory, sometimes even before hostilities had begun. Once in position, the quiet murders and sabotage would begin. Engineers and artificers would disappear one by one never to be seen again. Magical reagents would unexpectedly cause disastrous reactions and misfires. The effectiveness of the units can be best described by the bitter cartel saying, "It takes only one elf to ruin a good machine.""
 wood_elf_28_enchanted_bears:0 "Enchanted Bears"
 wood_elf_28_enchanted_bearsDESCR:0 "Due to their fey-influenced nature, the Deepwoods Bears were always notoriously resistant to magics of any kind. It was, for mages at least, disturbingly common to watch fireballs and thunderbolts alike to simply be shrugged off by the lumbering giants. For this reason, it was a testament to the growth in Wood Elven magical tradition when a druid in 1774 was able to successfully and reliably affect a bear with a haste spell.\n\nWhile the durations of these spells were only a fraction of the norm , the impact of a multi-ton bear hurtling at incredible speeds was a sight to see… and feel."

A word that would take centuries to even enter Wood Elven vocabulary, despite their goblin neighbor's obsession with it. Yet, after its formal introduction by the Gommo through the cyfelim sàisth, Faevir Vaytcothyd would make it his final act as Ceannasaí to integrate it into Wood Elven society and army.\n\nAs a part of that effort, newly trained Wood Elven artificers would learn to power devices through fey cooperation. While this made it more costly and difficult to produce than simply hunting lesser fey and other creatures for components like the Soyzkaru Cartel, devices such as Pixie Packs and Changeling Links would prove far more potent and capable than Soyzkaru creations."
 wood_elf_30_salla_saisth:0 "Salla Sàisth"
 wood_elf_30_salla_saisthDESCR:0 "By the dawn of the 19th century, the idea of rangers being a simple defense unit had long been forgotten. Only the finest elves were capable of surviving the grueling now decade-long training process. Those that did were bestowed an exclusive honor and title: ranger. For that reason, the rangers would ironically repeat history and slowly come to form their own informal clan, Salla Sàisth or the Ranger's Clan.\n\nOnly nominally under the control of the state and divorced from their original salla due to their training experiences, rangers began to act independently, forming their own methods of self organization. Often deploying without orders, these autonomous units leveraged their wide array of skills to remain on the field indefinitely, often only returning when their self-appointed mission was deemed complete"

 islanders_26_center_peel_squadDESCR:0 "Utilizing an old Joglik Ut tactic and largely made up of colonial conscripts, skirmishers of the Federation advance far ahead of the main army in small squads. When the enemy comes into view they break into 2 columns, the front 2 men fire a full volley from their triple barreled rifles before running through the center of the columns to the rear, allowing the 2 men behind them to open fire and follow. The constant firing creates the illusion that they're a larger force than they truly are, stretching an enemy army thin and greatly damaging their morale. When the battle truly begins between the main armies the skirmishers continue to harass the flanks of the opposing forces, pulling back before they can be retaliated against."

To combat the great terror birds of the northern riders, the harimari began to embed their crossbowmen within pike formations that could ward off cavalry. The combination of spear and crossbow became known as the "Thousand Splinter Defense" - its proponents noted that the name described the thousands of sharp shafts the enemy would encounter in battle; its detractors stated that few casualties were inflicted on the enemy because of the defensive nature of the formation, and that it was little more painful than a splinter."

Widespread use of firearms among the eastern harimari first began in Jiantsiang, where the greater penetration and longer range of these weapons proved its value against swift Shuuvush raiders. If the bird riders refused to give battle and face a Splinter Formation unit, musket fire from arquebusiers embedded in the unit could inflict losses on the Shuuvush from great range, whittling down their numbers and forcing them to quit the field."

Adopting a more aggressive stance to prevent enemies from firing upon them in the first place, the monks also began to use gunpowder themselves. Gunpowder fuses were attached to spears and lit to spray shrapnel and blind enemies when the monks closed to attack, whereupon they integrated their classic spear and claw weapons with braces of pistols that could be drawn, fired, and discarded as they cleaved through enemy formations. The great cacophony made by the monks' gunpowder weapons would lead to them being called "Roaring Tigers" in contrast with the earlier Crouching Tiger warriors."

Quickly recognized as superior to the old pike and shot formations that had dominated the region for the past century, line infantry became the standard array for Yansheni armies afterward. Three or four-line deep formations would rotate firing, retreating, and reloading to keep up a constant stream of projectiles to shred enemy formations. The advent of volley infantry also saw the first major integration of humans into east harimari armies, requisite to satisfy the need for manpower created by the expanding army sizes of the era and the higher casualty rates of this new form of warfare."

 east_harimari_26_prowling_riflesDESCR:0 "The surprising success of Xia Shadow Warrior hit-and-run tactics at defeating Dragon Command armies during the early 1700s caused many to mimic their tactics. Dedicated skirmishing units were equipped with rifles for superior range and accuracy and sent on wide flanking maneuvers towards enemy artillery and rear officer positions. Circling around the edges of battle, these units would directly strike at cannoneers, dispatch hostile officers, and raid supply trains and depots to disrupt enemy logistics and reduce morale."

Historically given only to those who had served for 10 years and seen action in at least 3 major battles, the Golden Stripe was considered requisite to advance to the rank of sergeant. While ensuring that these officers were all battle-hardened and experienced, this practice also badly restricted the ranks of field commanders available to eastern harimari units. Changes in military training and education that would culminate in the granting of a ceremonial golden stripe to all new soldiers did away with this cultural restriction and greatly improved the ability of the eastern harimari to field capable officers."

As gunpowder weaponry grew in penetrative power, it was able to defeat even the strongest of armor, and the noble Hupeng could not be protected on the field of battle. Rather than risk their mounts needlessly, the eastern harimari cavalry began to abandon direct cavalry charges and instead adopted Dragoon tactics - skirmishing and running down fleeing enemies on horseback, but spending the majority of the battle riding to where they were needed, dismounting, and fighting on foot."

Racing across the field of battle on horseback, the Four Winds were armed with a lance and brace of pistols. They would swiftly engage the foe, fire a full volley from their pistols, and then wheel away, skewering enemies with their lances as they went. After reloading, the Four Winds Cavalry would return to the field, often from a completely different direction, to continue their assault."

Thus the Lokemeioni were forced to adapt to the shifting tides of warfare. Instead of relying on simple levies, Lokemeion began to recruit sýnaranbhen, veteran soldiers defending the colonies near the Eltikhan, to hold the flanks of the battlefield.

Emulating the beasts-of-burden that worked the plows to till their fields, the Ameioni crafted war chariots for the horses to drive through the battlefield. Although these chariots proved to be unwieldy and occasionally unpredictable to operate for the drivers, their mobility on open fields could decisively overcome the virtuous, powerful phalanx. Through a combination of archers safely weakening the formations from the safety of the chariots and the ravaging damage that chariots could cause by running down wavering hoplites after volleys of arrows, the chariots proved to be a powerful tool to counter the phalanx."

The manipule was capable of efficient maneuvering and tactical flexibility which disrupted the stiff battle lines of the Degakheioni phalanxes, hindering the cohesion and discipline vital for their success. Combined with the effective application of heavy cavalry to flank and cause devastating shock damage, the Degakheioni phalanx was humiliated on the battlefield."

Plans were drawn to reform the army to leverage heavily-armored hoplites who would gather into dense phalanxes, equipped with javelins and thrusting spears, to overwhelm the Oktikheioni armies on the field. However, before Phocas could assemble his army for a second invasion, he was ousted from office, leaving the Phocas Phalanx as a conceptual battle formation."

With superior cavalry at their disposal, chariots were abandoned, in favor of more mobile, accessible and efficient heavy cavalry. In dense formations, the Keyolíoni would target enemy phalanxes that were pinned by allied formations, battering their unprotected flanks with sharp javelins before charging in with their thrusting swords, dashing and crushing their enemies in the process. Such innovations in mobile cavalry warfare contributed to the rapid decline of the Kheionai phalanx in early-modern warfare as the latter struggled to cope with the increasing intensity of battle."

However, the legacy of momentous military reform did not pass away with such a great elf. One such reform was the Fotistrépei system, where Ameioni administrators exchanged land and privileges to Kheionized Taychendi soldiers.\n\nKnown as the Fotistrépei, these soldiers would form a permanent and loyal native force. The Fotistrépei would not only help suppress Taychendi unrest under Ameioni occupation but also revitalize further conquest of Taychend when the Sun Elves arrived in Southern Aelantir and shattered Larankar's empire. Armed with both Cannorian muskets imported by their Kheionai leadership and indigenous weapons such as longbows and javelins, the Fotistrépei would act as light infantry responsible for providing firepower and probing attacks in support of Ameioni phalanxes who would steadily push towards the main enemy force. This, combined with ample heavy cavalry support, were decisive against Taychendi armies who could not adapt against Ameion's dynamic and overwhelming tactics on the battlefield."

The traditional way of war of the Kheionai was brought to kneel by the musket, whose bullets could penetrate the shields and armor of the mighty hoplite and shatter the morale and discipline of the phalanx formation in battle. Yet, despite their lethality, firearms could not shake the hardened hearts of the Arpediféri, the venerable pioneers of the phalanx.\n\nTo avoid dishonoring their kheion's most sacred institution, the Arpediféri would pay exorbitant expenses for the finest and strongest armor and equipment to save themselves from bullets, even going as far as consulting mages to render their shields seemingly invulnerable by enchanting them with the same abjurations that have shielded their people from the kaydhano for millenia. Though some would still fall despite their warded armor, others truly became invulnerable on the battlefield, forming the vital core for the Arpediféri army in the early-modern era."

Equipping themselves with pistols and foregoing most of their heavy full-body armor to allow greater speed on the battlefield, these equestrians transitioned from heavy cavalry into equally-as-dangerous skirmishers. The Oktikheioni Outriders were renowned for their ability to isolate phalanxes before orbiting their unfortunate enemies in a ring of death, firing as many pistols into them before tactically retreating into friendly forces to reload and repeat the process.

Soon after, the musket proliferated throughout the kheion, and its generals openly integrated them into the Besolakí army, reforming their strategies around such powerful weapons.\n\nThe Besolakí Square was a product of the mass introduction of firearms into the army, which was a hollowed formation which could protect arquebusiers as they shot at Bharbhen and rival Kheionai invaders under the safety of disciplined hoplites armed with sarissa and shields.

As a result of the penetrating power of muskets, Degakheioni hoplites would forgo their shields in favor of longer sarissas, which could steadfastly stand their ground against cavalry and other infantry. Arqubusiers would be deployed in two ranks in between Degakheioni pike squares, firing massed salvos at the enemy continuously as skirmishers before retreating behind the safety of Degakheioni pikemen.

As a result, professional cavalry became a rarity on the battlefield, only consisting of the military elite and upper-class citizen-soldiers. To protect themselves from the evermore deadly battlefield, these cavalry-elves would equip themselves with heavy curaisses and even armor their expensive horses with abjurated barding. Though the average Ormami cuirassier was slower than their contemporaries, they were relentless and invulnerable the moment they began their devastating shock charges on the battlefield, particularly when Ormami infantry had closed the distance and pinned enemy infantry with Delisian warfare tactics."

By the mid-1630s, there was one musketeer for every pike-elf remaining in service. The forward vanguard of the new Kherkan army were the Kherkan Grenadiers, who would fight as skirmishers using long-barreled muskets.\n\nThese Grenadiers would be infamous for throwing salvos of ceramic grenades to provide deadly cover before retreating from advancing enemy formations.

Inspired by Cannorian military advisors and his own experience as a mercenary in Cannorian armies, Doukas concluded that modern Kheionai formations were too slow, unwieldy and reactive to fight modern battles against the Bharben, and needed to be simplified while avoiding losing firepower.\n\nIn response Doukas ordered that battalions of soldiers would be divided into smaller and narrower companies to allow for superior movement and more troops to be active on the battlefield; these soldiers would be equipped with flintlock muskets and be issued long plug-bayonets in order to serve a dual role as musketeer and pikeman. Doukas' formations excelled in battle, especially in rough terrain, such as the forests of Devand, where massed infantry formations struggled, in-part due to their superior firepower, maneuverability, and efficiency in battle."

Kylakas Delis, who governed Ormam during the mid-1600s, would take advantage of the kheion's extensive mercantile connections to import thousands of flintlock muskets from friendly kheions to fully equip his soldiers with firearms. These soldiers would be assembled into lines of infantry companies, tasked in closing the distance with the support of skirmishers in order to fire a mass volley of musketry before charging the weakened enemy with bayonets.

However, Apikhoxí's people refused to tolerate the horrific suffering of massed warfare upon their kin, even as war crept upon their friends and family.\n\nTo address these concerns and minimize casualties, Apikhoxí's military would develop specialized infantry companies designed to minimize the devastation of musket volleys. Those at the front would be equipped with costly abjurated armor, similar to what the Arpediféri had pioneered, and fire upon the opposing line. Meanwhile, infantry without this armor would focus on reloading muskets behind safe cover to provide the front-rank soldiers. These freshly-loaded muskets would then be swapped with the spent muskets used by the armored frontline. The result was a devastating semi-constant barrage and lower casualties, if at the cost of less overall firepower."

As gunpowder warfare and cavalry doctrine rapidly evolved as the Kheionai were entrenched in deeper conflict against their neighbors and the Cannorians, many of the Devandi Kheionai states adopted mobile carabiniers to defend their roads and coastlines where their dense woods couldn't obstruct enemy armies.

Although certainly apocryphal, it reflected the profound mastery and knowledge that the Eneioni had of their own homeland compared to other peoples. When the Eneioni military leadership noticed the increasing effectiveness of open-order formations upon foreign battlefields, they collectively agreed with little debate to begin reforming the Eneioni army away from the old ways of closed-order formations that the rest of the Kheionai desperately held on to.\n\nThe new Eneioni army birthed from these reforms became one of the greatest of its generation in South Aelantir.

Forced to defend Deyeion with no aid, the Kylakas of Deyeion decreed the unpopular act of conscription, forcing all capable males to defend their homeland from the foreign invaders at any cost.\n\nThe conscripts would be consolidated into local militia companies led by veteran Deyeioni officers; these companies were responsible for defending their hometowns and if necessary, rapidly integrating with Deyeion regulars to provide vital manpower for open field battles to drive out the invaders. The flexible system would create hell for the invading Busilari as they were forced to fight through scorched earth, sudden mass infantry assaults, and militant local population.

Going into the late 18th century, the cavalry of the Amgremósi rode on specially-bred horses which were faster and more athletic than their other Devandi counterparts, using their speed to outpace the enemy and easily weave into the flanks of the battlefield; armed with carbines, the Amgremósi were capable of accurately firing while moving and just as competent at reloading on horseback.

As their position became more tenuous, the Alecandi Kheionai federalized into the Kheiós League and as a consequence, united their armies into a single banner.

Many of them relied upon massive formations of conscripted infantry to outmuscle their attackers, refusing to concede even a single village. But, the economic and political cost of full conscription became unsustainable for war for the Échate League. As a result their members would begin to devolve military responsibilities to smaller armies of highly trained and motivated skirmishers and light infantry, equipped with the finest rifles and uniforms which could camouflage into the forests and hills of Devand. These smaller armies were designed for territorial defense by creating a high-intensity guerilla war against any invaders to render even basic military operations impossible in home territory by instigating skirmishes, assaulting supply convoys, and raiding regimental camps to break the will of the enemy."

In the midst of the growing desperation of the warriors of Fahvanosy, the famous martial artist Toky Fastfists developed a new form of Moraingy which relied on cooperation between two martial artists to take down a single, larger foe. These Tagteams, armed with a variety of pistols and melee weapons were able to mount effective opposition to invading armies via hit-and-run attacks, and would prove important to the slowing of foreign encroachment upon the Fahvanosy Archipelago."

 vyzemby_28_cav_elefantDESCR:0 "The expensiveness of the Tibokefela caused many to question the usefulness of elephants in warfare, with many experimenting with putting artillery on elephants instead. What came to be known by many as the Ondofalefa, a driver would steer the elephant, while a crew of halflings manned a cannon placed on top. "

 vyzemby_30_inf_profDESCR:0 "With their failure to unify the mainland, the remaining Amazetany fell back to their lands, bloodied. They spent their next few years mainly hidden and recovering, but more importantly training and mastering their tactics and fighting capabilities. Not only that, they listened to the rumors and information of Cannorian tactics that spread across the lands. They developed proper counter tactics, smuggling the latest Cannorian guns and muskets from Busilari colonies in Fangaula, and modifying them to fit their style. The overall focus remained on first strike capability in an overwhelming initial salvo. "
 vyzemby_30_inf_trad:0 "Fahvanosy Mpiambatorapi"
 vyzemby_30_inf_tradDESCR:0 "In the 1880s Cannorian colonists and their fleets started to arrive in bigger numbers, scouting off the coast of Vyzemby. The locals quickly shifted their combat tactics to make sure they kept the colonizers, as well as the mainland lizardfolk, away from the island. They built and maintained watchposts at regular intervals along the coast, allowing the local forces to adopt rapid fire-and-retreat tactics. Regiments would deploy as much firepower and cannon as possible at once to discourage and scare off the enemy.. This tactic was refined over time, since the Cannorians came not as a unified force but as several competing fleets each trying to carve out a chunk of the land. Local forces learned to group up in smaller detachments of up to a thousand men, deploying, firing and then retreating, rotating with a supporting force while they reloaded and prepared their firearms."

 halfling_1_slingers:0 "Slingers"
 halfling_1_slingersDESCR:0 "Since the primaeval days of the Halflings, the sling has been one of their most sacred tools. From hunting vermin which assailed their vast farmlands to striking down ravenous predators that threatened their families and livestock, the sling's many advantages in accessibility and efficiency was ideal for the Halfling's stature and modest way of life. In times of conflict, the slinging skill of the average halfling proved to be mightier than the weapon's humble appearance may imply, for halfling slingers were not only accurate sharpshooters, but also cunning and evasive ambushers."
 halfling_1_village_militia:0 "Village Militia"
 halfling_1_village_militiaDESCR:0 "Many halfling polities did not pursue developing formal armies because of their historical subordination to greater empires, but this did not mean that the halflings allowed invaders to bully them in their home territory. When conflict flows into the borders of a halfling village, its residents will mobilise into local militias, turning their warm communities into stalwart bastions. Every road was to be blockaded, every halfling was to defend and fortify the village's border, and every morsel of food was to be denied from enemy consumption. Eventually, the exhausted invaders would be forced to detour into rugged terrain and paths, where the village could launch advantageous ambushes against them."
 halfling_1_pony_riders:0 "Pony Riders"
 halfling_1_pony_ridersDESCR:0 "Unlike their larger equine cousin, the horse, the pony's shorter stature, quicker movement and stronger frame enabled it to be the perfect steed for Halflings. However, the ponies' wily and independent nature made them exceptionally challenging to tame; especially the wilder ones among them. Affluent Halfling lords who could afford maintenance for a string of ponies would train their retainers to fight on-horseback as cavalry. The pony riders' speed and power made them excellent flankers in open battles where Halfling foot-soldiers struggled to keep pace."
 halfling_5_bushrangers:0 "Bushrangers"
 halfling_5_bushrangersDESCR:0 "The Small Fellows adventurers quickly discovered the post-Greentide land of Escann to be savage and untamed beyond their modest expectations, filled with hostile tribes and strange creatures that couldn't be simply ignored. To avoid certain demise, the Small Fellows would establish the Bushrangers' Guild, which was an organisation consisting of Greentide veteran soldiers that were tasked in defending the fledgling Halfling settlements in Escann. Despite their limited numbers, the Bushrangers proved to be successful, defending the Small Fellows' territory from orcish raids while improving the effectiveness of local militias through improved leadership and training. The military contributions of the Bushrangers enabled the survival of Newshire."
 halfling_5_grainwardens:0 "Grainwardens"
 halfling_5_grainwardensDESCR:0 "The intensity of the Wars of Dominion between the Kingdom of Gawed and the Kingdom of Lorent over control of the Small Country threatened the livelihoods of the native halflings to the point where militarization was no longer a question, but a necessity for their protection. As a result, Halfling city elders commissioned permanent standing units to defend themselves from highwaymen, bandits and roving bands of Lorentish and Gawedi soldiers. Colloquially known as the Grainwardens for their role in defending the farms and granaries of the rural countryside, these salaried soldiers were veterans of the Wars of Dominion who would provide local militias with a core of active patrolling soldiers to support the defence of the Halflings."
 halfling_6_armored_ponies:0 "Armored Ponies"
 halfling_6_armored_poniesDESCR:0 "The province of Roysfort, where Halflings were known for their stables of strong Roysfoot Thoroughbreds, would not only grow wealthy from the pony trade to northern Halfling states as they demanded more ponies to meet growing military and economic needs, but would make their own innovations upon Halfling cavalry. By equipping their Thoroughbreds with metal barding, the ponies became resilient against glancing melee blows and ranged fire; this granted Halfling cavalry greater durability and staying power in the battlefield."
 halfling_9_ankleshankers:0 "Ankleshankers"
 halfling_9_ankleshankersDESCR:0 "When Halfling armies transitioned out of their traditionally defensive warfare, the Ankleshankers were a Greymill evolution of the typical halfling guerilla which exchanged safe ranged skirmishing for audacious close-quarters combat. These halflings would stealthily close the distance upon an unsuspecting enemy before causing terror by shanking their ankles with dirks after sneaking between their ranks. Their legacy would be remembered through the story of Albert Flourmaker, a local hero who waited for days in a captured Gawedi grainstore, along with 24 guerillas, before ambushing the garrison in the cover of dusk. Flourmaker and his allies' bold action drove away the Lorentish garrison from their own encampment despite their odds. "
 halfling_9_guerilla_bands:0 "Guerilla Bands"
 halfling_9_guerilla_bandsDESCR:0 "The village militia became more sophisticated as the Halflings got engulfed in ever-more devastating Cannorian wars as manpower, quality, and equipment steadily improved. Many Halfling villages would appoint standing militia leadership, record and maintain permanent stocks of equipment and even keep census numbers to ensure every capable Halfling could be trained, supplied and deployed for the long-term defence of their community. These militias had superior leadership, initiative and staying power than the ad-hoc local defence units that preceded them."
 halfling_10_pony_knights:0 "Pony Knights"
 halfling_10_pony_knightsDESCR:0 "As the Wars of Dominion escalated between Gawed and Lorent, Viswall would emulate their Lorentish overlords' cavalry. Combining the Halfling pony's strength and mobility with the robust plate armour of Lorentish blacksmiths, these pony knights provided Halfling armies with competitive, albeit limited, shock cavalry that was most useful in open battles, where Halfling contingents were often forced to fight under disadvantageous terms against their mightier enemies."
 halfling_12_newshire_village_patrols:0 "Newshire Village Patrols"
 halfling_12_newshire_village_patrolsDESCR:0 "The Newshire Village Patrols refer to the local units of the Newshire Army during the Age of Unravelling. As adventurer groups consolidated into independent polities and orcish raids became more dangerous, the need for a standing army was forced upon the Newshire Halflings. The Stewards of Newshire would agree to levy taxes for the foundation of a new army, combining the roles of village militias and the Bushrangers' Guild into the Newshire Army's Village Patrols, tasked in defending the homeland from potential invaders. When raids were detected from their daily patrols on the trails of Newshire, nearby units could rapidly consolidate into a defensive army to launch a counterattack upon the potential invaders."

 halfling_12_redfoot_musketeersDESCR:0 "As the Wars of Dominion dragged on, the Redfoot settlement of Coppertown became a local armaments production centre due to their expertise in metallurgy and craftsmanship. Through the expansion of local armouries and smithing sites, Coppertown's many blacksmiths became equally-capable gunsmiths. The Coppertowner muskets would become the favourite of Redfoot skirmishers for their stopping power and lethality. Musketry would usurp slinging as the primary ranged weapon of halflings by the end of the War by all but the most frugal of their militias."

 halfling_14_pony_pistoliersDESCR:0 "During the early stages of the Small Country revolt, Halfling rangers struggled to deal with the encroaching Lorentish armies invading their homelands; thousands of raids and attacks were reported yet there were only so many to heed their people's calls for help. Halfling rangers would adopt horseback riding to gain indispensable speed to track and intercept marching Lorentish convoys and regiments. When intercepting an enemy unit, these rangers would allow local militias to prevent the Lorentish units from advancing by any means necessary while they outmanoeuvred the enemy to block their retreat and constrict their positions, firing their pistols at both rearguard and retreating Lorentish soldiers."

 halfling_15_halfling_irregularsDESCR:0 "The Small Country Revolt swept across the region against their Lorentish overlords and in the process, the idea of independence resonated throughout the halflings who could hear the Small Country's heed for help. The dream of a sovereign Small Country drove many Halflings throughout Cannor to join such an ambitious cause as soldiers, responsible for not only seizing Lorentish fortresses and armouries, but fighting in thousands of skirmishes, ambushes and battles. By the end of the Small Country Revolt, halfling chroniclers estimated that one out of every five halflings had a relative or family member who volunteered in the Small Country's many militias."
 halfling_15_volley_revolutionaries:0 "Warheart Infantry"
 halfling_15_volley_revolutionariesDESCR:0 "The Small Country Revolt proved that independence couldn't be simply won with defensive action alone. Ottokar Warheart, an experienced commander and former adventurer from Pearview, would reorganise his personal army into an aggressive expeditionary force to fulfil this dire need. Warheart's Halflings would be led deep in enemy territory and attack encampments, supply trains and even entire Lorentish formations at night. These raids emphasised an initial salvo of devastating musket-fire before prolonged skirmishing that applied superior marksmanship and positioning. The daredevil nature of these attacks shattered the resolve of exhausted Lorentish armies, securing victories battle after battle."

 halfling_18_pony_cuirassiersDESCR:0 "Inspired by the legacy of Halfling rangers serving as pistoliers in the Small Country Revolt, the Cowskeep would raise heavy cavalry in the veneration and innovation of these heroes. Channelling the spirit of the Cowskeep Battlebull, their beloved and pugilist war mount, Cowskeep cuirassiers were renowned for their bold shock charges, regardless of the risk. The cuirassiers would launch aggressive charges against enemy formations regardless if they were distracted by skirmishers, shattering their rank-and-files with sabres like bulls' horns before the bellowing of blunderbusses and pistols resonated in the air. By the end of such a vicious brawl, the enemy would either rout in complete terror or be pounded into the dirt of the battlefield."
 halfling_19_longmusket_snipers:0 "Longmusket Snipers"
 halfling_19_longmusket_snipersDESCR:0 "The long-musket was a rarity within the average armoury due to its hefty and non-standardized components rendering production difficult and their deployment for conventional skirmishing even more challenging. As a result, many of these long-muskets would circulate into the hands of Elkmarcher halflings, who were exceptional woodsmen and hunters, to serve as snipers. These snipers awaited to intercept high-value targets that were expected to cross their area of operation, concealing themselves in lush nature in dugouts for days until their objectives were fulfilled. Notably, their endurance and patience has led some to believe that Elkmarcher snipers could last days in static positions unwaveringly, only resting to periodically chew on robust Elkmarch deer jerky to pass the dragging time."
 halfling_19_stake_squares:0 "Stake Squares"
 halfling_19_stake_squaresDESCR:0 "The stature of a Halfling guaranteed that any conventional pikemen would be impossible to employ. Given the increased pressure on the Small Country to militarise to offensively compete with their tense neighbours, the Small Country integrated sappers into their regular musketeer units to provide support in direct action. These sappers were raised to efficiently deploy fieldworks and various traps to weaken the advancing armies while hidden in the midst of the battlefield thanks to the terrain and smoke. The sappers would be best known for their utilisation of stakes as a replacement to pikemen, which could be easily deployed in squares to divert enemies into artificial chokepoints, where Halfling musketeers could easily shoot the disorganised enemy."
 halfling_23_barrage_line:0 "Barrage Line"
 halfling_23_barrage_lineDESCR:0 "As volley-fire became the predominant method of musketry throughout Halann, Halflings eventually transitioned their forces to adhere and respect volley-fire strategies. However, strategists also understood that halfling armies struggled in open territory. The Small Country would develop small companies of light infantry that could easily adapt drilled volley-fire and open order formations in the midst of dense forest cover. These light infantry companies fought in two ranks, launching barrages of concentrated musket fire to end skirmishes decisively and quickly before their positions could be compromised and attacked by the recovering enemy."

 halfling_23_west_tipney_rangersDESCR:0 "Although Halflings of West Tipney exalted the sereneness of their humble territory, those claims were frequently challenged by their belligerent neighbours, both Cannorian and Ynnic. As a result, the West Tipney Rangers were founded as a means of expelling rival frontiersmen, tribes, and colonists that were encroaching upon their new homeland. Donning green coats to mask themselves amongst the forests and grasslands of their lands, these rangers fought with rifled muskets against potential invaders, who often prowled open grasslands and the many roads of West Tipney, looking for rightfully West Tipneyean lands to seize for themselves."
 halfling_23_war_dog_riders:0 "War Dog Riders"
 halfling_23_war_dog_ridersDESCR:0 "The Vyzemby-Cannor trade introduced war dogs to the Small Country; agile, strong, and cheaper than ponies. Halflings would raise packs of war dogs as mounts, utilising them in scouting and skirmishing roles within their cavalry units. Halfling war dog riders would use their mounts' speed and strong senses to quickly survey areas ahead of the main army. When necessary, war dog riders would charge into the fray, using their mounts' strength and vicious bite to rip apart their enemies."
 halfling_26_mobile_skirmishers:0 "Mobile Skirmishers"
 halfling_26_mobile_skirmishersDESCR:0 "As deployed firepower escalated due to advancements in artificery, artillery and musketry, halflings rejected any notion of closed-ordered formations, instead staunchly favouring open-order warfare and attrition warfare. Halflings reduced the grandiose numbers of their armies in favour of a strong core of skirmishers and rangers, who would engage the enemy indirectly: supply trains disappeared, entire regiments returned to headquarters battered, and the will of the enemy slowly deteriorated through their attacks. In battle, these skirmishers would fight in open order, with the main bulk of their forces pinning down formations as allied troops engulfed and crushed them like apples being processed into Appleton cider."
 halfling_26_treacherous_tagteams:0 "Treacherous Tagteams"
 halfling_26_treacherous_tagteamsDESCR:0 "In close quarters combat, Halflings tended to struggle due to their smaller stature rendering the use of weapons, such as polearms, ineffective. As weapons became more compact and efficient during the Age of Artificers, the Halflings' quiet pace and short height became more of an advantage in open order combat. Such concepts culminated in the strategies proposed by Thomsbridger General Brandon Shadowfoot written in his military theory book, "Halfling Warfare in the post-Artificery Battlefield." Stipulated in his book, pairs of infantry would be armed with pistols and dirks for close-quarters combat. from point-blank range initiating Tagteams would sow chaos through their ambush while the other squads attacked gaps in the opponent's formation, allowing the Tagteams to defeat the enemy in detail."

 halfling_28_small_grenadiersDESCR:0 "Grenades were an uncommon weapon in the Small Country until goblin artificers from Gerudia began to make their way to Viswall, introducing E++ explosives to Small Country armourers. Combining the traditional affinity for halfling slinging and the devastating power of this new substance, the Small Country's Grenadiers were established. These troops would use their slinging strength to launch E++ bombs behind the safety of allied skirmishers who kept the enemy pinned and distracted, causing severe casualties as the bombs' payloads spewed devastating fire upon their victims."

 halfling_28_viswall_fenciblesDESCR:0 "By the later years of the Age of Artificery, the Small Country would reimplement widespread conscription to compensate for the army's entanglement in Cannorian affairs. These state-managed militias, known as the Viswall Fencibles because conscription offices were located in Viswall, provided resistance against potential invaders where the standing army could not while providing them the training, financing and equipping a modern army needed. Although not as skilled in warfare as the professional regulars, the Fencibles could afford the professional army lots of time to mobilise and intercept enemy armies through an intense guerilla campaign, bent on crippling the invader's war effort at every angle."
 halfling_28_dogoons:0 "Dogoons"
 halfling_28_dogoonsDESCR:0 "The war dog's discipline and obedience was unmatched compared to typical Cannorian steeds; no gunfire, artillery or magic-slinging could break the senses and will of the Vyzemby wardog. As a result, it was no surprise that halflings quickly adopted them as war mounts perfect for their stature and cost. Harnessed onto the backs of these dogs, dogoons would use mounted musketry, allowing their dogs to autonomously guide them to safety after each shot during these skirmishes. Should the enemy greedily chase after the dogoons, the war dogs would viciously attack the chaotic ranks of the advancing enemy while the riders warded bayonets away from their trusted companions with sabres."

 halfling_30_shotgunnersDESCR:0 "The Cannorian scattergun was invented by the Ashsinger's Guild of Tinkering and Weaponsmithing in Turnwell as an all-in-one tool for self-defence, hunting, vermin exterminating and excessive noise-making. Featuring a breech-loading bolt-action, the Cannorian scattergun was a simple weapon to operate effectively for any simple-minded soldier. The Small Country would adopt and produce scatterguns for national defence purposes, equipping every Fencible regiment with two platoons of scattergunners to serve as point-guard units and shock troops in close-quarters engagements."
 halfling_30_windgunners:0 "Windgunners"
 halfling_30_windgunnersDESCR:0 "The windgun was invented by gnomish tinkerers in Viswall, and was soon adopted as part of the overarching strategy of Halfling warfare in the Small Country. Despite its issues with reliability, maintenance and power, the windgun's softer report and lack of muzzle flash was excellent for the Halflings' reliance on guerilla warfare. Windgunners would be deployed to take meeting engagements with the enemy, constantly firing and repositioning to take advantage of the windgun's staying power before retreating once their air canisters depleted, protected by reinforcements who would attack the weary enemy formations with conventional muskets."

These predators become stranger still, as they can grow in size like a shadow grows in the presence of light, becoming large beasts with claws extending several inches long, some, to the size of the trees themselves. Their only weakness is true sunlight, causing them to revert to their natural form where they quickly become prey if caught within the confines of the shadow swamp.

But not all were destined for a life of servitude in the fields and palaces of their new Mengi overlords; some, who had the build or background of a soldier in the past life were given a chance of freedom: to take a greataxe and fight back the Yezel Mora Horde. While originally seen as cheap and expendable troops, the Bakra Slave Axemen (Bakra being a corruption of the gnollish 'Krah') eventually become known as fearless warriors that can break the momentum of a troll horde that would have overwhelmed less desperate men.\n\nIt is said that if an axeman brings the severed head of a troll, then their freedom is guaranteed."

Until recently they have been left to roam freely until they are brought in to be broken, but now even that is not necessary. Bound to a rider through a special ritual, feral horse riders share a deep and unique emotional connection to their steeds. For this reason, they are much more nimble than a regular rider.

The answer came in the form of a blunderbuss, whose design was quickly imitated and mass produced and sold on cheap, subsidised, to the many settlements across the land. When a troll horde came knocking, the civilian militia would form brigades, throwing anything inside their makeshift weaponry: from sticks and stones, pieces of furniture, jewelery and anything else that might slow or perforate trollflesh."

One such "compromise right" was the right to field a personal army, but of a size equal to or less than one-fifth the sum of the greater federation's army.

The Alas'gasidi, who desperately clung to the reins of power against the surging popularity of republicanism, founded a new army, the "First Haraf'ne Loyals". This army was formed under the pretense of defending against insurrectionist threats to the Kinah Federation and its officers were specifically selected for their zealous allegiance to the ruling Alas'gasidi.

In fear of a growing reactionary front, the new republican administration exercised emergency powers to found the "Elkaiyah'ne Silaor" or "Republic's Army", an elite force of soldiers whose purpose was to defend the republic and its ideals. In its history, it took part in many battles against reactionary revolts, many of whom were veterans of the old, monarchist armies.

Haraf'ne carbines were exceptionally reliable in the desert landscape where the coarse sands would often cause regular firearms to jam or misfire. The relatively cheap production of these carbines and plentiful horses of the 'ne' would allow the founding of many dragoon regiments that fulfilled both policing and military roles for many years."

The "Naspa'k'aii", as it was known, was a projectile-launching mechanism in the form of a bow which allowed a single soldier to insert into its drawstring a small, round, metal ball (including anti-personnel, anti-magic, and explosive projectiles) that could then be shot at supersonic speeds towards its target. Although limited in use by its rapid consumption of damestear and expensive production, companies armed with these accurate, devastating weapons often broke an enemy line in their first volley and served as excellent skirmishers."

They captured many firearms in those raids, quickly adopting the gun themselves. These tactics proved effective, with the first siege of the Bone Citadel ending in Cheshoshi victory in 1514; the fall of the Citadel in 1521 was the result of a political failure, not a military one.

Familiar with the Karasski Lizardfolk's lands, these expeditionaries scoured the jungle in pursuit of Lizardfolk to retaliate for their crimes. Often organised in tightly-knit platoons of eight to twelve hunters, Isagumze warriors were well-adapted in not only fighting against the Lizardfolk specifically but also sophisticated skirmish tactics designed to break the massed formations that the Lizardfolk deployed."

 west_sarhaly_10_cannorian_horse_ridersDESCR:0 "When the Cannorians landed on Fangaulan shores, extensive trade reintroduced horses back into the region. Heavier and more aggressive than the horses that once roamed the plains of Fangaula, these horses were quickly integrated into the militaries of West Sarhal. Unfortunately, such horses were unused to the harsh environment and local diseases of the region, resulting in high death rates that required extensive costs for maintenance and replacement through Cannorian shipments. Despite such logistical setbacks, the horsemasters were influential in the evolution of warfare in West Sarhal as they eclipsed war donkey riders in versatility and effectiveness."

 west_sarhaly_12_binwarji_shieldwallDESCR:0 "With the introduction of firearms in Fangaula, the tactics of the region's warfare began to change. Binwarji states steadily transitioned into more dynamic tactics centred around the war-arms; infantry companies that could both launch aggressive pushes and provide mobile defence through strict discipline and superior armour. These tactical units were armed with a combination of poisoned javelins, shields, and ilwoon swords and were led by Ton-tigi (Quartermasters); who were lower nobles that distinguished themselves through battle and military experience. The right equipment and great leadership allowed them to execute various manoeuvres that were otherwise limited from typical spear formations used by the Binwarji."

Although strange in their customs and languages, they were a source of immense power through the mercenaries and weapons they offered to the kingdoms of Horashesh. The Zuvavim would be the first to adopt muskets in the region, issuing them to urban guards that defended their coastal cities. In the open grasslands of southern Horashesh, these musketeers opened battles with a terrifying fusillade of gunfire to tear through skirmishers and infantry alike, before safely maintaining their lethal presence in the midst of friendly troops holding the battle lines."

Juanasuar, many West Sarhaly cavalrymen found themselves without royal patronage and keen to keep their prior prestige and status. Some of these cavalrymen formed bandit groups, colloquially known as Jinidingo or Bastards, freely sacking villages and exhorting protection tribute from areas where central authority had degraded. In desperation, some kings employed these cavalrymen as skirmishers and raiders in a strained effort to maintain any semblance of peace, offering them vast stocks of horses, land, and titles in return."

 west_sarhaly_15_ashen_irregularsDESCR:0 "The eruption of Mt. Junansuar in the early 1600s brought immense chaos upon the Fangaulans. The rigid state structures of the region collapsed and with it, famine and social upheaval fluttered with the smouldering ash of such a catastrophe. Unable to field the massive armies in the midst of such chaos, Fangaulan kings granted great autonomy and special rights to the cities and villages in exchange for defence obligations. Often consisting of soldiers levied by the local ruler or chief of the community, these irregular militias replaced traditional Fangaulan regimental systems."

Most notably, the Kuivanhi saw musketry as a long-awaited improvement to their standing armies that fueled the fires of their expansionist ambitions. With over a quarter of their armies being armed with various matchlocks by the 1600s, the Kuivanhi were well-versed in volley fire tactics which excelled in the pitched battles throughout the grasslands of their homeland. By concentrating their firepower in massed formations, the Kuivanhi countermarch was a formidable tactic that surpassed the traditional skirmishing that muskets were first used for."

Reimagining some of their military traditions, the Farari maintained their role as mounted skirmishers by constantly attacking the enemy's massed infantry with excellent sharpshooting. To maintain an effective stream of gunfire against their enemies, the Farari brought jonow aides mounted on donkeys, who would help reload and arm the muskets on behalf of their masters."

During the chaos and unrest, the monks expanded their production of Dendugma steel and even made innovations on the lathes and smithing practices of their workshops as a means of producing refined firearms. The culmination of this wartime production created the Dendugma rifles, rifled muskets that used various friction-based ignition systems unlike traditional matchlocks. Reliable, efficient, and more powerful than the average musket used in West Sarhal, Dendugma rifles were a rare premium weapon that was seen in the hands of elite infantry in the region."

Through direct backing of the Busilari Empire, Zanga's loyalists received a generous amount of weapons and supplies to pacify Binwarji and Dendugma, even including modern artifice-weapons such as magishields and wandlock rifles.

While gunpowder proliferated into their people's way of war, the physical prowess and martial experience of the Kudemtu was never forsaken. Even as the skirmisher's slings were replaced with cast-iron bombs and the spears of old with bayonets fixed upon muskets, the Kudemtu grenadier remained a versatile and rugged soldier that fought with the doctrine and spirit of their ancestors on the modern battlefield."

Colloquially known as windraiders in Common, these cavalry were armed with long spears and pistols excellent at sweeping away unprepared and battered armies with their dizzying speed and aggression. The economic and military viability of the windraiders contributed to making contemporary West Sarhaly warfare more dynamic, unpredictable, and deadlier than before."

Every fighting man, or war head, was expected to carry a suyyankour, a long-rifle that had superior stopping power and range that allowed them to steadily pick away at garrisons, patrols, and even armies, before swooping in to seize the loot. These Ndurubu war heads would play an important role as skirmishers and scouts in the War Against the Last Xhaz, which ended gnollish rule in North and West Sarhal indefinitely."

Refusing to allow their noble heritage and homeland to be torn from their hands, many of the Kuvandhi formed militias to repel all foreign invaders. Known as the Relentless Ones, these guerilla armies were known for their ferocity and prideful bravery against Lizardfolk soldiers regardless of their own casualties.

The quieter report of windguns and magitech carbines allowed for Farari to remain deadly and mobile without startling their war mounts into unpredictable frenzy. Such modern cavalry, often supplied and trained by the state rather than any regional administration, allowed for the surviving West Sarhaly states to consolidate their power bases and enforce their reformist will upon unruly kings or chiefs."

The Zuvavim's government uprooted their ancient beliefs in pursuit of self-strengthening and revitalisation to remain independent through military might. Now unfettered from untamed superstition, petty kingships, and cultural infighting, the Zuvavim consolidated these reforms towards a professional army that was united in serving their country.

# Forest Goblins
 forest_goblin_1_boar_stampede: "Boar Stampede"
 forest_goblin_1_boar_stampedeDESCR: "The Forest Goblins' relationship with the indigenous boars of the Deepwoods has been one of unpredictability. Although not formally domesticated, mostly due to the boar's temperament and physical superiority over the typical goblin, these beasts could be contained in large pens as long as they were coaxed with supple amounts of food and living space. In times of war, some goblin trappers would do the unthinkable and unleash the beasts from their pens, allowing them to escape and stampede through anything unfortunately crossing their path to freedom. Friend and foe alike were crushed or gored, but the tactic had led to decisive victories on occasion."
 forest_goblin_1_trappers: "Trappers"
 forest_goblin_1_trappersDESCR: "Among the settled races in the Deepwoods, the Forest Goblins lacked the might of the orcs nor the graceful technique of the Wood Elves; but goblins cared little for either of those, for it only took one stone to the head or a stake through the chest to kill either. In times of war, the Forest Goblins would use their cunning to create elaborate traps to dispatch the enemy to make up for their lesser numbers and inferior weapons: snares, wolf-holes, and heavy rolling objects became the three nightmares for any army encroaching on their territory."
 forest_goblin_1_shankers: "Shankers"
 forest_goblin_1_shankersDESCR: "When you are fewer in number and weaker than every single enemy you face, you have to pick your battles carefully. Fighting an enemy army head-on will likely get you killed. But if you strike their supply convoys, attack their camps while they sleep, or simply ambush the enemy army while it is on the move, your chances are much better. This was the central idea behind the goblin shankers. Wielding only short blades and spears and wearing no armor, shankers are able to move quickly and stealthily, focusing more on small raids and keeping elves out of their territory than on ‘winning' wars."
 forest_goblin_5_diggers: "Zmiezane"
 forest_goblin_5_diggersDESCR: "Enduring the vicious Greentide left the Forest Goblins more resilient, more confident, and, most importantly, more goblins, thanks to the Greentide goblin slaves rushing to join clans like Spiked Log and Verminhusk. For the first time in recent history, these clans would bring the fight to their neighbours.\n\nIn battle, native Old Ways Forest Goblins would still employ traditional traps. However, rather than retreating when the enemy became mired in these traps, they would signal their Common Goblin allies to charge in. Together, these "Zmiezane" (mixed) goblin armies would prove to be an improvement in Deepwood goblin warfare."
 forest_goblin_5_kadaki: "Ka'daki"
 forest_goblin_5_kadakiDESCR: "Before the Verdant Veil fell, warlocks were rare in goblin armies, even among pactseekers. While a warlock clanboss would use magic against their foes, their armies would fight much like any other Forest Goblins' would. Contact with orcs and Cannorians and seeing more uses of magic started to change this. Warlocks would use pact magic and chants to rile their troops up into a frenzy in order to maintain their morale. Among other goblins these armies would become known as ka'daki or cacklers, for their deranged laughing as they descended upon enemy forces."
 forest_goblin_6_armored_boars: "Armored Boars"
 forest_goblin_6_armored_boarsDESCR: "As the Forest Goblins quickly gained knowledge in metallurgy and animal husbandry from interactions with the outer world, they began domesticating boars for both agricultural and military application. Although such endeavors resulted in mashed goblin herder more often than not, those rare successes saw the breeding of sociable, albeit smaller, boars. To compensate for their lesser stature, these boars would often be equipped with simple metal faceplates before being unleashed from their pens. These faceplates could block glancing blows from arrows and stones, allowing the boars to blindly stampede through unabated."
 forest_goblin_6_deepwoods_crawlers: "Deepwoods Crawlers"
 forest_goblin_6_deepwoods_crawlersDESCR: "The introduction of common goblins to the tribes of the Deepwoods also saw the introduction of their steeds. The giant spiders, originally native to the Serpentspine's caves, introduced an interesting new dimension to cavalry combat in the Deepwoods: verticality. Even with a goblin rider, giant spiders were able to crawl up the massive trees of the Deepwoods just as well as the cave walls of their old home, allowing for new ways to fight."
 forest_goblin_9_oubbligs_chosen: "Oubblig's Chosen"
 forest_goblin_9_oubbligs_chosenDESCR: "The Pactseekers saw some success with their new uses of warlock magic applying to whole armies, but it was nowhere near the achievements of Oubblig. Seeking to emulate his tactics, they made use of Feyrealm portals to transport armies, and took to opening new portals themselves. This could be done both over short distances to attack an army from an unexpected angle, and over longer distances to assault undefended positions. While quite useful, this required the warlock to frequently travel through the Feyrealm, which could be quite dangerous. Warlocks who consistently pulled it off became known as ‘Oubblig's Chosen'."
 forest_goblin_9_powdershooters: "Powdershooters"
 forest_goblin_9_powdershootersDESCR: "The introduction of firearms to the Deepwoods revolutionized Forest Goblin warfare. As the first to adopt these new weapons, Old Ways goblin armies were finally able to secure a unique advantage against elven grace and orcish strength. The Deepwoods goblins preferred larger-caliber arquebuses, issuing them to their chiefs' trusted allies to provide reliable firepower and ranged capability. Known as powdershooters, these goblins typically formed four-goblin crews, hiding their guns behind camouflaged pavises while two fired and reloaded. Although these guns were inaccurate, their bullets would plow through any armour while the smoke and noise provided cover for skirmishers to close in and attack."
 forest_goblin_10_boar_lancers: "Veikvesho"
 forest_goblin_10_boar_lancersDESCR: "After generations of successful animal husbandry, the goblins created the first rideable Deepwood boars. Although still very short-tempered and rash, these boars gave just-enough leeway for goblins to ride them without being bucked off and pulverized. Certain clans, such as the Spiked Log's Feysmasher family, would mount their boars with the strongest among their number and arm them with the Veikvesho Chain-sword. These twined shortswords were attached by chains which could be used to cut down enemies surrounding the charging hogs, and were devastating in battle. Despite their clumsy maneuverability, the shock power of the Veikvesho cavalry was formidable and rightfully feared."
 forest_goblin_10_crawler_ambushers: "Crawler Ambushers"
 forest_goblin_10_crawler_ambushersDESCR: "As Forest Goblins gained proficiency at using giant spider cavalry inside the deepwoods, they gained skill in utilizing the greatest tool in battles that are fought in three dimensions: gravity. Explosives are usually limited in range by the strength of a throwing arm or the reliability of a launching mechanism, but when you are positioned directly over your enemy, it is child's play to cause a very large explosion with a blast radius that doesn't include yourself. Besides, even if you miss, the enemy will tend to be too disoriented to defend against the spider and goblin that are dropping on them right after."
 forest_goblin_12_brambleburners: "Brambleburners"
 forest_goblin_12_brambleburnersDESCR: "At the height of the Emeraldtide,Brambleskinner clan gunsmiths would invent one of the most infamous weapons to ever disgrace the lush Deepwoods: the Brambleburner mortar. Designed to project large projectiles consisting of tree resin, boar fat and dry vegetation wrapped in a cage-like ball, the Brambleburner could launch these volatile projectiles over dozens of meters into enemies positions. Upon impact, these projectiles would ignite, unleashing ravenous flames upon foes, and sometimes unfortunate nearby friends."
 forest_goblin_12_parwsef: "Parw'sef"
 forest_goblin_12_parwsefDESCR: "While modernization and technology made Old Ways goblin armies more centralized, the Pactseeker forces developed in the opposite direction. Competent warlocks would gather small warbands around themselves, and fight mostly independently from the central force. These warlocks became known as Parw'sef, or small bosses, and the forces they led were usually even more loyal to their Parw'sef than to their clanboss. Due to the decentralized nature of these formations there were a variety of differences between how different Parw'sefs operated, with tactics ranging from mass Feyrealm portals and ambushes with illusion magic to the enlistment of fey races into warbands."
 forest_goblin_14_crawler_firebrands: "Crawler Firebrands"
 forest_goblin_14_crawler_firebrandsDESCR: "The greatest weakness of Deepwoods Crawlers has always been their vulnerability to arrows and guns. In order to remedy this, goblins would do their best to control the enemy's movement and limit their lines of sight on their fragile mounts. This was traditionally done mostly with barricades and traps, but over time another method gained traction: fire. Using Firebombs to enclose and isolate units of enemies, Crawlers could then follow it up with their signature bombard charges without risk of being picked off by adjacent forces."
 forest_goblin_14_fazezs_hogz: "Fazez's Hogz"
 forest_goblin_14_fazezs_hogzDESCR: "Sometime in the mid-16th century, a wealthy goblin herder named Fazez would create the first "hogz" in the Deepwoods, the first breed of boars that were both sociable and powerful. Despite their costs, these hogz would quickly spread throughout the Forest Goblin clans becoming well loved for their friendly demeanor and easy trainability. The combination of genuinely controllable boar calvary combined with heavy armor to protect their beloved steeds enabled goblin armies to perform complex flanking maneuvers previously far beyond their reach."
 forest_goblin_15_burnbombers: "Burnbombers"
 forest_goblin_15_burnbombersDESCR: "Through steady iteration, Brambleburner evolved to become the Bramblebomber. Alleviating many of its predecessor's mechanical flaws such as a tendency to self-detonate and woeful accuracy, the Brambleburner proved not only a more reliable weapon but also enacted innovations such as early-artifice explosive shells which could spread incendiary payloads in a greater area.\n\nThese weapons would be the core of "crawling fire" strategies employed by early-modern goblin armies. Bramblebombers would continually fire behind enemy formations to spread wildfires to force them to march away from the flames and into the sights of powdershooters, who would fire en-masse to maximize casualties in a single attack."
 forest_goblin_15_zelen_tien: "Zelen-tien"
 forest_goblin_15_zelen_tienDESCR: "Just as Forest Goblins used to live in the fringes of groves ruled by Wood Elves, so now did the Pactseekers live in the fringes of groves ruled by the Old Ways goblins. Usually born of the old Parw'sef warbands, Pactseeker raiding bands regularly attacked supply lines with hit and run tactics, employing magical vines and brambles to hinder their enemies' movement.\n\nThe most elite of these raiders became known as Zelen-tien, or "Green Shadows" for their stealthy attacks and the hostile plantlife they left in their wake. These raids would not only keep Pactseeker influence alive in goblin society but also enable the capture of significant amounts of modern weaponry, allowing non-warlock Pactseekers to trade their spears for muskets and become far more dangerous."
 forest_goblin_18_boarback_shootas: "Boarback Shootas"
 forest_goblin_18_boarback_shootasDESCR: "Pike-and-shot warfare and its more devastating successors would see the effectiveness of forest goblin cavalry drop precipitously. In an effort to maintain relevance as the might of shock cavalry waned, the boarback gunners emerged. Armed with multi-barrel blunderbusses, designed specifically by cartel artificers for mounted combat, boarback riders would emulate the charges of old before firing all of their loaded ammunition in a calamitous salvo at point-blank range. After such a vicious volley, the cavalry would continue to charge forwards, relentlessly crushing the enemy."
 forest_goblin_18_crawler_snipers: "Crawler Snipers"
 forest_goblin_18_crawler_snipersDESCR: "As gunfire became more potent, the advantages of close combat using giant spiders became overshadowed by their vulnerability to bullets. Instead, spiders were used foremost for their great maneuverability, allowing their riders to reach good vantage points to fire at enemies from great distances, and relocate long before they could in turn be engaged. If a battle would turn to their favour, however, the Crawlers could finally be used offensively again, catching and killing any fleeing foe too slow to escape the skittering spider legs."
 forest_goblin_18_heralds_irregulars: "Herald's Irregulars"
 forest_goblin_18_heralds_irregularsDESCR: "While Pactseekers had for a long time relied on the same cavalry as their more conservative brethren, the rise of what would be known as riftrippers would cause a divergence in battlefield tactics. Before the battle started, warlocks would focus on pulling monstrous creatures from the Feyrealm ranging from strange variations on animals from Halann to downright incomprehensible abominations.\n\nThey all have one thing in common, however: you can clasp a saddle and reins on any of them, if you try hard enough. With the great variety in mounts, it was virtually impossible to develop any kind of comprehensive strategy for cavalry warfare, but the results of unleashing these creatures upon the enemy spoke for themselves. As one warlock said, "Even if we barely know how to steer it, the enemy will surely not know how to fight it.""
 forest_goblin_19_maketa_companies: "Maketa Companies"
 forest_goblin_19_maketa_companiesDESCR: "The goblin cartels of the Deepwoods, through their many trade relationships, would integrate multitudes of foreign mercenaries into their ranks to bolster their manpower. These mercenaries would be known as maketa companies,named after the maketa blades they used to wantonly shred through the thickets of the Deepwoods and the flesh of their foes.\n\nHaving no love for the forest nor any interest about the Fey's mischievous pacts, these mercenaries would be tasked with destroying any pocket of Pactseeker resistance in cartel control in exchange for generous payments. Armed with flintlock muskets and bramblebombers, the maketa companies uprooted and incinerated the last vestiges of Pactseeker resistance in the western Deepwoods."
 forest_goblin_19_riftrippers: "Riftrippers"
 forest_goblin_19_riftrippersDESCR: "The Feyrealm brims with magic and life, and Pactseekers had long done little but scratch the surface of its potential. This was made apparent when Paw'sef Yzva made an exceptionally rare pact with the Herald of Change. Rather than just open dimensional rifts to maneuver her own soldiers, Yzva would also pull monstrous creatures from the Feyrealm and unleash them on enemy armies to shatter ranks before launching their own attacks. Other Paw'sef and warlocks quickly followed suit. The Riftrippers were born.\n\nAs Ysva and other riftrippers would later learn, opening these rifts had the added benefit of often unleashing an enormous amount of fey magic, which they could use to temporarily increase their powers. While this use of fey magic was considered quite risky (Ysva would permanently turn into a dragon newt), the risk of such magical misfire would be outweighed by the surge in power."
 forest_goblin_23_megamoth_riders: "Megamoth Riders"
 forest_goblin_23_megamoth_ridersDESCR: "After having tried out almost every odd creature from the Feyrealm they could get their hands on as mounts, one emerged as the clear favourite of the Pactseekers: the Megamoth. These normally docile creatures proved agile enough to maneuver through the thick canopy of the Deepwoods, robust enough to hold their own in any charge, and smart enough to be trained to become extremely reliable mounts. That these creatures were able to fly in a combat environment where barricades and traps are employed very regularly was a particular bonus, and the Pactseekers made extensive agreements with the Achfey known as the Herald of Change, creator of the Megamoths, to ensure an ample supply of the creatures."
 forest_goblin_23_oubbligschain_infantry: "Pactchain Infantry"
 forest_goblin_23_oubbligschain_infantryDESCR: "While warlockery made magic more accessible than only the use of inherent birth magic, Pactseeker forces would still consist of at most a few dozen warlocks, the bulk of their armies filled out with hordes of mundane goblins. This would all change due to the discoveries of the warlock Niclin Toebiter, who first discovered chainpacting using a magical loophole.\n\nThrough this loophole warlocks could act as conduits for new pacts, letting the warlock take the place traditionally held by an archfey and granting pacts in the same manner. In this way, some of the magic from the warlock's own pact could be distributed among other goblins, giving them access to basic spells. While Pactseeker forces were still predominantly non-warlock goblins, the surge in magic users ensured Pactseeker survival and radically altered the path of Pactseeker society."
 forest_goblin_23_soyzkaru_bruisers: "Soyzkaru Bruisers"
 forest_goblin_23_soyzkaru_bruisersDESCR: "Observing the success of their southern kin's mixed companies as loyal standing soldiers, the Soykartzu cartel-bosses would attempt to emulate the Overclans' armies by implementing their own standing armies that synthesized the intelligence of the goblins and the strength of other races. Exchanging the wavering loyalty of foreign mercenaries with integration of the formerly-ostracized green orcs, the Soykartzu cartel-bosses found a reliable source of permanent enforcers in the middlemen of Forest Goblin society. Armed with the finest firearms that goblin artificers could fabricate, these enforcers provided a formidable force to be wielded against uppity goblins workers and Soykartzu rivals. Unfortunately, they were more often used to enable internal cartel-boss grudges."
 forest_goblin_23_web_and_tusk_formations: "Web and Tusk Formations"
 forest_goblin_23_web_and_tusk_formationsDESCR: "Forest Goblin animal domestication reached its zenith when trainers were able to convince forest crawlers and boars to work together without trying to kill each other. Soon after this breakthrough, generals were quick to devise ways to combine the merits of boar and crawler cavalry to quickly tear through unprepared infantry. This came to be known as the Web and Tusk Formation.\n\nThe sheer strength of armoured boar cavalry would be responsible for initiating any cavalry charge to tear through enemy lines, while crawlers would exploit the gaps, scuttling to envelop their enemies both their unguarded flanks and above them using the lush treeline to allow goblin bombers to drop their payloads onto their enemies. Thanks to these unique combined-animals arms, Forest Goblin calvary quickly became feared and respected within the Deepwoods."
 forest_goblin_26_indentured_muscle: "Hobjazoyu Muscle"
 forest_goblin_26_indentured_muscleDESCR: "Deeming the potential of cartel-boss infighting escalating to civil war too realistic, reformers within the Soyzkaru administration would cunningly consolidate all enforcers and standing soldiers, forcing them to continually rotate garrisons to avoid entrenchment of power. New contracts and pay systems were implemented, which left these soldiers indentured to the newly formed Hobjazoyu or "war association," as opposed to any boss' personal whims. These contracted soldiers provided long-term and professional manpower that were impartial to any cartel-boss regardless of their familial history, and allowed for greater standardization and equipment for cartel forces. As effective as they were at breaking cartel-boss power, these reforms would end up monopolizing military functions under the Hobjazoyu instead, and create a new potentially destabilizing factor for Soyzkaru."
 forest_goblin_26_pactunion_warlocks: "Pactunion Warlocks"
 forest_goblin_26_pactunion_warlocksDESCR: "While the invention of chainpacting allowed for fey magic to be much more widely available to Pactseeker goblins, much magical power was lost in the transaction. In order to counteract this, the Pactunions were created. Groups of goblins would bargain with Archfey together, in order to have the magic of their pact spread over all of them. Many Archfey refused to participate in this, but some, such as the Fused Monarchs and the Prince of Fools, were very receptive to this new way of warlockery. This widespread access to fey magic also led to rapid magical innovation, such as with new mass warding spells to protect soldiers on the field of battle."
 forest_goblin_28_heralds_chosen: "Herald's Chosen"
 forest_goblin_28_heralds_chosenDESCR: "If you can fly and spew fire at will, are you any meaningfully different from a dragon? That is the question our warlocks are asking of the megamoths now. What once were swift and lithe creatures have been magically crossed with faerie dragons, to terrifying effect. No doubt the product of the Herald of Change's unknowable schemes, the Chosen of the Herald can travel at speeds easily twice that of a boar and can unleash fireballs, lightning, and mass hallucinations upon the enemy. When our warlocks asked what the Herald wanted in return for his gifts, his emissary simply replied to "change the world." We will gladly oblige."
 forest_goblin_28_howling_moving_castles: "Howling Moving Castles"
 forest_goblin_28_howling_moving_castlesDESCR: "The Soykartzu Cartel, whether out of goblin curiosity, ruthlessness, or hubris, would develop one of the earliest ultra-heavy cavalry known to Halann. Standing several stories high and powered by hulking damestear engines, these machines carried dozens of cannons and hundreds of goblin gunners while shambling through the battlefield. As their artificial appendages stamped through the fields of the western Deepwoods, so too did the roaring of cannonfire and the howling of its crew follow, leaving a warpath of destruction behind them. Excessive and revolting to any bystander's sensibilities, these "moving castles" excelled as both fire support platforms and shock-and-awe assets, leaving opposing soldiers questioning their life choices."
 forest_goblin_30_indentured_line_infantry: "Soykartzu Aparko Legions"
 forest_goblin_30_indentured_line_infantryDESCR: "When the need for manpower skyrocketed, the Soykartzu Cartel, under the lobbying of the Hobjazoyu, flexed their pockets to gather the greatest military minds to modernize their entire military. Out of these backroom meetings, a sickening combination of extensive artificery, Cannorian military doctrine, and cartel manpower was conceived. Goblins and orcs would be conscripted, promised with better lives if they could overcome months of miserable barrack-life and strenuous artificer-powered combat simulations. Those who survived these tribulations became members of the new Aparko (Guard) Legions, leaving their former compatriots behind to rot in the mines and sawmills for a new prestigious life. "
 forest_goblin_30_surdencom: "Surdencom"
 forest_goblin_30_surdencomDESCR: "Following the great successes by the Pactunions, the command structures of Pactseeker warbands became much more horizontal, and warlocks from the same patron began to refer to one another as Surdencom, or siblings. Much of the magic the Surdencom used was cooperative, with multiple warlocks contributing to very powerful charms and spells. More than anything, they were known for extremely powerful illusion magic, capable of fashioning entire battalions of illusionary goblin armies out of thin air, both intimidating the enemy with false numbers and giving them useless targets to fire and charge at."

 salahadesi_1_akasi_spearmen: "Akasi Spearmen"
 salahadesi_1_akasi_spearmenDESCR: "Originating during the Crodamic rule over Akasik, these lightly armored soldiers fought in a shieldwall formation and acted as the backbone of the Kheteratan army after the Dragon Wars. They would remain so for almost a millennium, due to the ease of training and equipping these soldiers in mass. However, their inability to withstand the demon fueled charges of the resurgent gnolls, despite superior numbers, or to quickly suppress internal revolts due to local loyalties raised doubts about their role in a quickly changing world."
 salahadesi_1_inor_warriors: "Inor Warriors"
 salahadesi_1_inor_warriorsDESCR: "The collapse of Kheteratan authority over Khetapera led to the newly formed states resorting to independent bands of local warriors. Their knowledge of the terrain and effective guerrilla tactics made them a great asset for these states, performing continuous attacks against the enemy and disappearing before they could respond. They were also significantly cheaper than an organized army, as they brought their own equipment and were paid primarily with loot. Their strong sense of freedom gave them their name, as Inor means free in Kheteratan. This was sometimes an inconvenience for the states hiring them, as their loyalty to everyone but their comrades in battle was dubious at best."
 salahadesi_1_crodamic_camelry: "Crodamic Camelry"
 salahadesi_1_crodamic_camelryDESCR: "These elite camel rider regiments were created by king Sedoric I Crodamis, first of his dynasty. In them both rider and camel wore heavy armor, with the former carrying large spears with which they charged at the enemy causing devastating damage. Since their establishment they proved time after time to be the most effective military asset of the kingdom of Kheterata, acting as the hammer to break enemy lines. While their size and influence has waxed and waned over their nearly thousand years of service, they were still a force to be reckoned with by the 15th century."
 salahadesi_5_exiled_legions: "Exiled Legions"
 salahadesi_5_exiled_legionsDESCR: "Formed by warriors who fled to Khetapera and Akasik after the gnollish invasion of Kheterata, these legions of battle-scarred fighters had served Kheterata all their life, and wished for nothing else than reclaiming their homeland. Clad in steel plate armor and carrying long spears and shields, they fought as one against the gnoll hordes and were renowned for fighting without an ounce of fear in their soul. Their bravery and rigorous training made them very successful in battle. Their legacy did not end with the death of these first veterans, as they trained their sons and worthy volunteers in their ways so their cause would live on after their passing."
 salahadesi_5_tijarikheti_formations: "Tijarikheti Formations"
 salahadesi_5_tijarikheti_formationsDESCR: "The term Tijarikheti Formations refer to a series of military organizations created by the various states of Khetapera as they consolidated, in an attempt to create armies loyal to the state rather than to coin. On paper, they were largely organized in a similar fashion, using longbows, short swords and padded armor, and employing guerrilla tactics adapted to the rough terrain. In practice, however, each state would adapt these formations to leverage their greatest strength. Aramoole would center around their powerful battlemages while Duwarkani focused on harpy support from the air. The former slaves of Samsumbat were numerous and relied on that advantage along with their willingness to die for their freedom. Meanwhile, Muhaqaar's mages increased the strength of their troops with magic, and their vassals in Mattabo complemented them with light cavalry."
 salahadesi_6_gnoll_hunters: "Gnoll Hunters"
 salahadesi_6_gnoll_huntersDESCR: "Deployed first by the exiled Ahati state of Mattabo, and later imitated by other Tijarikheti states, these light horse cavalry corps saw great success in the constant frontier war with the gnollish packs. The riders usually carried bows and javelins, which they used to wreak havoc among gnollish ranks. They incessantly harassed the enemy, attacking and quickly retreating before they could respond, exhausting them physically and psychologically. Usually these bands were independent from the state, and would be hired by it or by particulars to perform raids into gnollish territory or eliminate troublesome packs. Their payment would come out of the loot they obtained, while the employer provided insurance in case of death, injury or loss of horse. "
 salahadesi_9_deshak_reformed_infantry: "Deshak Reformed Infantry"
 salahadesi_9_deshak_reformed_infantryDESCR: "The kingdom of Eborthil, which had ruled Deshak since 1430 after gnoll invaders slaughtered the local royal family, would undertake an effort to reform the outdated and disorganized army of the Salahadesi kingdom in the beginning of the 16th century. As these reforms were aimed at improving the kingdom's capability to defend itself from the gnolls, the Tefori authorities looked at the pike and shot, which had been successfully deployed against the Greentide in Escann. The Deshaki variant combined spearmen with harquebusiers like the Cannorian one, but it employed lighter armor and also used supporting bowmen to better take advantage of the mountainous terrain. "
 salahadesi_9_freemen_regiments: "Freemen Regiments"
 salahadesi_9_freemen_regimentsDESCR: "These regiments were first employed by the republic of Samsumbat, descendents of former slaves that valued freedom more than anything and would rather die than see themselves in chains again. They were made entirely of volunteers, who elected their generals among themselves. Carrying spears, swords and bows, they marched into battle singing as one. After Samsumbat was integrated into Aramoole, these regiments continued their service, as proud and brave as ever before. "
 salahadesi_10_duwarkani_land_support: "Duwarkani Land Support"
 salahadesi_10_duwarkani_land_supportDESCR: "The majority of Duwakani's human warriors fought riding on top of the local camel breed, resilient and red-furred. This variant was adapted to the rough and mountainous terrain, as were their riders. The warriors took advantage of their knowledge of the terrain to ambush enemy troops, and charged at them with spear in hand. Meanwhile harpy troops carrying bows would fire in quick succession as they flew around their foes, quickly overwhelming them with this multidirectional attack. This military composition continued being used after Duwarkani was integrated into Aramoole, due to its great effectiveness. "
 salahadesi_12_elemental_musketeers: "Elemental Musketeers"
 salahadesi_12_elemental_musketeersDESCR: "This formation, based on pikemen and musketeers with planetouched soldiers among their ranks, was developed by the Akasi states to better defend themselves against the ever increasing gnollish threat. The combination of gunpowder weaponry and elemental powers proved extremely effective. The regiments had usually one planetouched of average powers for every 20 non-powered soldiers, while the ones of highest potency served as commanders to entire legions. To ensure their service and loyalty the states offered hefty pensions and even noble status to planetouched and their families in exchange for military service, often even recruiting them from abroad."
 salahadesi_12_trumpet_arquebusiers: "Trumpet Arquebusiers"
 salahadesi_12_trumpet_arquebusiersDESCR: "The Tijarikheti militaries were late to adopt gunpowder weapons, but adapted quickly once they were introduced. These first firearms were of limited range and accuracy and lengthy to reload, so careful planning was required to avoid the regiments wasting all their shots and being overwhelmed by the enemy while reloading. The arquebusiers platoons paired those firing the weapons with soldiers armed with gigantic shields, who would retreat behind the gunners once a trumpet blast sound indicated it. Successive blasts would tell the troops the moment to shoot, and a designated note was used to signal it was time to initiate retreat."
 salahadesi_14_metalclad_camelry: "Metal-Clad Camelry"
 salahadesi_14_metalclad_camelryDESCR: "A reformed version of the Crodamic Camelry, which learned from the limitations of its predecessor and from the defeat in the gnollish invasion of Khetarata. The rider now carried significantly lighter armor, and in turn the camel armor was heavier and stronger. The riders carried pikes with which they would charge if considered necessary, but their primary weapon was a long range musket. Once at range they would dismount the camel and place themselves behind it, using it as an improvised barricade. The armored beasts could withstand significant enemy fire, while their rider fired at the enemy from this relative safety. "
 salahadesi_15_aramoole_unyieldings: "Aramoole Unyieldings"
 salahadesi_15_aramoole_unyieldingsDESCR: "After unifying Khetapera under their command the armies of Aramoole underwent a full reform, so as to better leverage the resources acquired from their recently achieved status as one of the great powers of Sarhal. In these new regiments the front line was composed of elite heavy armored lancers, trained from an early age to resist any enemy charge without taking a single step back.They formed an unbreakable line, behind which lines of musketeers quickly and accurately shot and reloaded.This formation was supported by the powerful battlemages of the country."
 salahadesi_15_chainbreakers: "Chainbreakers"
 salahadesi_15_chainbreakersDESCR: "These regiments originated as Akasi slaves rallied to revolt by adventurers and supplied with weapons by Cannorian states seeking to destabilize Viakkoc. They managed to escape to Ekha and Deshak, from where they organized into a full-blown army with support of their asylum states, and regularly launched raids against Viakkoc. They engaged in guerrilla warfare, taking advantage of their knowledge of the terrain, with their main objective being liberating as many of their brethren as possible. The gnolls would soon learn to fear their banner, a black broken chain over a white background, as the Chainbreakers were many, brave, effective and took no prisoners."
 salahadesi_18_akasik_mountains_cavalry: "Akasik Mountains Cavalry"
 salahadesi_18_akasik_mountains_cavalryDESCR: "These Akasi light cavalry units wore little to no armor, carried muskets and rode on top of local horses of sturdy stock. This allowed them to navigate their mountainous homeland without much difficulties. They ambushed the enemy in mountain passes and difficult terrain, and quickly disengaged and disappeared into the mountains if the situation turned against them."
 salahadesi_19_bronze_dragon_regiments: "Bronze Dragon Regiments"
 salahadesi_19_bronze_dragon_regimentsDESCR: "Originally attributed to Aakhet the Bronze himself, the creator of this formation of musketmen was actually general Akir "The Humble". According to his journals he was inspired by an Aakhet's speech in which he talked about the importance of mobility in the battlefield and of facing the enemy as an unified force. Akir concentrated his musketmen into one solid line in order to hit the enemy with an incessant rain of fire and lead, shredding through enemy ranks. If repositioning was necessary mages would cast haste en masse, allowing soldiers to quickly retreat into a more convenient position. Akir did not claim ownership of the concept because he preferred the people of Aramoole to think that Aakhet, who had abandoned the country a little before the war against Konolkhatep, was still helping them in some way."
 salahadesi_19_igrax_erega: "Igrax Erega"
 salahadesi_19_igrax_eregaDESCR: "These irregular Akasi regiments engaged the gnolls in asymmetrical warfare, making up for their inferior numbers with their knowledge of the mountains and their guerrilla tactics. Their long distance shooters take out the enemy leaders, traps are placed to eliminate careless gnolls, and meticulously planned ambushes thin the enemy ranks. Igrax Erega is gnollish for "Mountain Snake", the despective name their gnoll foes called these soldiers, who took it as a mark of pride, making a drawing of a little snake sliding between two mountains their distinctive sign."
 salahadesi_23_tijarikhet_bayonets: "Tijarikhet Bayonets"
 salahadesi_23_tijarikhet_bayonetsDESCR: "In the beginning of the 18th century the musketeer regiments in Aramoole incorporated bayonets to their standard equipment, which allowed them to set aside spears and swords. This allowed soldiers to defend themselves when out of ammunition and to charge against the enemy like pikemen without needing to change their weapons. This innovation resulted extremely useful for an Aramoole that now wished to exert further influence over Horoshesh, with the pretext of protecting it from gnollish and lizardfolk aggression."
 salahadesi_23_deshaki_auxiliars: "Deshaki Auxiliars"
 salahadesi_23_deshaki_auxiliarsDESCR: "Due to the two realms sharing a ruler, Deshaki regiments would support Eborthil's army as auxiliary troops in the various Cannorian conflicts and colonial enterprises the kingdom was involved in. An agreement stipulated that these troops would be discharged early and sent back to Deshak keeping their equipment. There they would serve again, now in the Salahadesi kingdom armies, where their experience and up-to-date equipment made them an invaluable asset for a realm besieged by gnolls by all flanks."
 salahadesi_23_aakhephita_riders: "Aakhephita Riders"
 salahadesi_23_aakhephita_ridersDESCR: "During the late 17th century Aakhet the Bronze developed a great interest in horse breeding. After a few decades, however, he determined that he had created the "perfect breed", and quickly lost interest in the subject. While Aakhet would move on, the military capabilities of the new breed were not overlooked by Aramoole's high staff. The Aakhephita, meaning Dragon Horse in Kheteratan, are a quick and resilient breed, able to maintain a significant speed during long periods of time. They were the preferred mount of the elite cavalry troops of Aramoole. Carrying muskets with bayonets, these troops used the horses mainly for transportation, dismounting when they reached the enemy. If the situation turned dire they could quickly mount and retreat, as no mount in Sarhal could outrun the Aakhephita."

 salahadesi_26_akasik_defendersDESCR: "The Akasik Defenders were created during the invasion of the Last Xhazobine, an existential threat of the highest caliber for the Akasi states, that forced them to quickly adapt their militaries. Composed by a back row of musketeers that shelled the enemy with lead and a frontline of shieldbearers who carried artificer produced shields, made to withstand the gnollish Hellfire. They were expensive to produce, but very effective, and such a desperate situation was not the time to skimp on army funding. These regiments stalled the demonic hordes significantly, but they were eventually defeated and slaughtered. However their spirits would live on, and when the Xhazobine was destroyed in Fangaula the people of Akasik rose up and avenged their brave defenders, pushing the gnolls into the desert."
 salahadesi_26_dragonfire_grenadiers: "Dragonfire Grenadiers"
 salahadesi_26_dragonfire_grenadiersDESCR: "These elite regiments were established by Aramoole during their war with the Khatalashya lizardfolk empire, who invaded the Horasheshi territories of the former. They served as shock troops and specialized in close combat, carrying the usual bayoneted musket but also powerful black powder explosives, great for sowing chaos and death on enemy ranks. They were infamous for their wanton cruelty and psychological warfare tactics, with the purpose of terrorizing the lizardfolk into retreating. While extremely effective they were expensive to arm and train, and their aggressive tactics made them suffer excessive amounts of casualties. Aramoole was eventually forced to decommission them for lack of resources, losing the war shortly after."
 salahadesi_28_daw_jabir_camelry: "Daw Jabir Camelry"
 salahadesi_28_daw_jabir_camelryDESCR: "These elite camel riding troops, deployed mainly by Deshak and Aaramole, took their name, meaning "Two Braves", from the fact that each camel carried two soldiers on its back. Neither the soldiers nor the animal carried any armor, as to not further burden the camel with the weight. Instead, they brought along two muskets. The soldier in the front would shoot at the enemy before passing the now discharged musket to his companion. In return, the second soldier would pass the second weapon before reloading the first one."
 salahadesi_28_camel_artillery: "Camel Artillery"
 salahadesi_28_camel_artilleryDESCR: "By mounting small cannons onto camels the states of Akasik and Khetapera were able to quickly and easily move artillery in rugged terrain, where other forms of transportation would be difficult. The soldier would usually dismount before firing, although some versions allowed a skilled rider to shoot while the animal moved. The destructive capability of these units was enormous, while also enjoying significant mobility. Over the ensuing decades, more experimental takes on the concept were also designed by ambitious artificers, but they were all too unreliable or expensive to be used in significant quantities. These included a camel mounted with a crude prototyped gatling gun, a camel carrying a fireball thrower and, appearing only in the design plans of an anonymous artificer and with no evidence of actual use at any time, a camel with what appeared to be a laser cannon."

 salahadesi_30_new_akasi_infantryDESCR: "After the defeat of the Last Xhaz Busilar achieved full domain over Akasik, and undertook a full reformation of the armies of their new subjects in Ekha and Deshak, to avoid them being too dependent on the already overstretched Busilari armies in the future. Cutting-edge military equipment was distributed, a rigorous drill was put in place, and military service was made mandatory for men of proper age. The officer corps was also professionalized, by requiring would-be military leaders to have studied in Busilari military academies. This led to a significant portion of the military high command being Busilari, making it easier to keep these armies loyal to the Cannorian kingdom."
 salahadesi_30_revanchist_legions: "Revanchist Legions"
 salahadesi_30_revanchist_legionsDESCR: "These legions were the result of radical revanchist ideology that took over the state of Aramoole after its humiliating defeats against the gnolls and the lizardfolk. The extreme militarization of the state caused them to impose compulsory military service for men and women, with the trainees being subjected to the toughest and most rigorous military training possible. Their industry was also completely geared towards war, so as to supply their ever expanding army with the latest military innovations. This resulted in an extremely disciplined army that moved and fought like one in the battlefield, a "dragon of fire and steel" according to the account of a Cannorian adventurer that witnessed their training."

 lizardfolk_1_arsa_obash: "Arsa Obash"
 lizardfolk_1_arsa_obashDESCR: "Constant warring among the lizardfolk left skilled warriors as a premium commodity in their society; this meant that compromises were often made regarding the quality of the average warlord's host. The arsa (spear) became the cornerstone weapon for any fledgling lizardfolk polity as they were cheap, accessible, and yet effective weapons. The lizardfolk filled their ranks with levies armed with long arsa, allowing them to clash against their enemies until exhaustion and casualties forced one side to abandon their pride and retreat."

 lizardfolk_1_raktata_sharitsayaDESCR: "Where there is rural countryside, there are thousands of tribesfolk that a lizardfolk warlord could sway to their mighty cause with promises of glory, loot, and new land. The sharitsayas, or tribal warriors, provided lizardfolk rulers with brave warriors who would willingly charge forwards when the arsa'orbash formations eventually mired themselves into an exhausting deadlock. The sharitsayas' boldness was key to converting battlefield stalemates into decisive victories."
 lizardfolk_1_hippolry: "Greatmaws"
 lizardfolk_1_hippolryDESCR: "Since time immemorial, Lizardfolk have unleashed hippo-like warbeasts known as greatmaws into battle. They are towering creatures with a large tooth-like horn above their gigantic maw and have a green hue that allows them to blend into the jungles and its waters. Lizardfolk dialects refer to them as Ajaras, while Common has adopted the word "greatmaw" to describe their large mouths. Combined with their great strength and thick skin, these creatures can breach through the lines of armies and the jungle's canopies with equal ease."

 lizardfolk_9_litrix_arsaDESCR: "For the emerging powers following the collapse of the 332nd Empire, quality equipment and soldiery were a highly-demanded resource, one that the chaotic societies of the lizardfolk couldn't consistently provide without quickly squandering. When the grand city of Zerat fell, the naga of Rayaz pragmatically integrated the surviving Zeratas nobility and allowed them to maintain subordinate retainers in exchange for their unwavering fealty and service. These retainers, equipped with iron-reinforced gambesons and poleaxes, were excellent for the exhausting and drawn-out battles that the Lizardfolk typically fought."
 lizardfolk_9_abjar_obash: "Abjar Obash"
 lizardfolk_9_abjar_obashDESCR: "When armour became more prevalent and the imperial lizardfolk became more organized in battle, some Ashhana warbands began to use two-handed swords that could cleave through the massed spear formations and armour of the typical lizardfolk army. Known as kaz'abjar, these massive swords complimented the brutality and ferocity of the Ashhana, who enjoyed battle and its mastery as a religious art. These sword-wielders were prevalent amongst the Karach people."

 lizardfolk_10_armored_hippo_chargersDESCR: "With the widespread development of metallurgy among lizardfolk due to greater access to metals, Ajaras began to be cladwith heavy metal armor in battle, which barely slowed them down due to their immense strength. This has allowed them to sustain more damage in battle and to continue to use their endurance as an advantage."

 lizardfolk_12_tzir_obashDESCR: "The tzir was the product of increased centralization and manpower by the Rayaz after their successful conquest over the northern lizardfolk. Regional armies led by the Rayaz's new commanders, now having access to more professional sources of soldiery, would create the tzir, or wall, formation; the tzir deployed the arsa'orbash in wide columns to maximize pressure upon their enemies while steadily closing inwards to envelop their flanks and engulf and destroy them in battle. Supported by shock troops such as sharitsaya braves or elite mercenaries, the tzir broke the mold of traditional lizardfolk battle and helped the Rayaz decisively defeat their enemies."

 lizardfolk_12_abjar_kashayaDESCR: "In search of true beauty, some Zaradyrra practitioners began to integrate dance arts into their combat, believing that it would bestow great power and beauty upon the battlefields they fought in. Over decades of practice, these Ashhana sword-dancers would create styles that combined the tenacity of lizardfolk swordsmanship and the frenzied excitement of their war dances, employing them in ambushes against their Anzalkatsa brothers to great effect, most notably by the Zulbur and Ishyaga warbands."
 lizardfolk_14_hippo_reiters: "Ajara Agyrs"
 lizardfolk_14_hippo_reitersDESCR: "With the advent of gunpowder introduced through Cannorian contacts, the Lizardfolk began arming all corners of their military with gunpowder, including Ajaras. Now greatmaw riders were armed with both a melee weapon and a pistol. The latter was used during a charge, riders firing at point blank range and then immediately falling in with their sword. Used properly, Agyrs were an effective force in battle."

 lizardfolk_15_urban_gunnersDESCR: "When the Kanoray kasktsataya arrived to trade with the Karassk, firearms followed with them. Greatly impressed by its power and potential, the Karassk began buying muskets to defend the walls of their mighty cities. These weapons were then modified to use serpentine levers to compensate for lizardfolk dexterity, with larger caliber barrels to accommodate more powerful ammunition and punch through lizardfolk scales and hippo hides. Firearms were used decisively to defend Karassk walls from invaders, eventually being deployed to weaken the tzir's cohesion and discipline in the open battlefield through continuous volleys of gunfire."
 lizardfolk_15_nashana_abjar: "Nashana Abjar"
 lizardfolk_15_nashana_abjarDESCR: "With the rapid spread of ranged weaponry in the Age of Unravelling, some lizardfolk sword-wielders desperately pleaded to powerful mages, including hags, to save their pride and identity as warriors from being humiliated and forgotten over time. Offering sacrifices of wealth, free will or even their souls, many sword-wielders were given magic powers, ranging from projectile-deflection to ranged slashes invoked by the swings of their blades. The rise of nashana-abjar was quickly denounced by Anzalkatsa practitioners as treacherous and heretical, but their effectiveness was gravely concerning on the field."
 lizardfolk_18_hippo_cuirassiers: "Agiziz Ajaras"
 lizardfolk_18_hippo_cuirassiersDESCR: "As firearms became stronger and more precise, the tanky build of ajaras became less of a factor, and their large size grew to be more of an issue. The solution to the talented craftsmen of lizardkind was simple, make even stronger armor that could endure bullets and swords alike. This worked for some time, keeping lizardfolk cavalry relevant during the age of gunpowder."
 lizardfolk_19_one_banner_regiments: "One-Banner Regiments"
 lizardfolk_19_one_banner_regimentsDESCR: "With the 333rd unification of the lizardfolk under the Rayaz, the disparate warhosts, regional armies, and urban guards were consolidated into a singular Imperial Army. With the vast resources of the empire pooled and distributed based on the specific needs of the court in Khogadash, standing lizardfolk regiments could be fielded without relying upon frustrating negotiations and gatekeeping from local powerholders. As a result, the 333rd Empire could field a sizable, trained, and most importantly, politically-unified army. This type of standardisation would become commonplace in the evolving Lizardfolk states, allowing for greater mobilisation of manpower."
 lizardfolk_19_rykyarasa: "Rykyarasa"
 lizardfolk_19_rykyarasaDESCR: "When the 333rd Empire sought to integrate the Ashhana back into the Anzalkatsa fold, the naga found great opportunity to strengthen their powerbase through the remnants of the defeated crocfolk. Using their divination, the naga found mutations amongst many Ashhana children that could be exceptionally useful to bolster their power through military might. Claiming religious sacrilege, the naga would integrate many mutant children to be trained and educated to become ardently loyal troops for the naga elite to use for their own whims. Organised into units known as the Rykyarasa, or the cleansed blades, these soldiers fulfilled specialised roles in the naga's private armies based on their mutations; from hulking shock troops to night-piercing raiders and even fiery war mages."
 lizardfolk_23_lizardfolk_line: "Lizardfolk Line"
 lizardfolk_23_lizardfolk_lineDESCR: "With greater unity than ever, lizardfolk regiments reinvented and adopted the line formation to meet the needs of the modern battlefield. Due to the rough, unpredictable terrain of the lizardfolk's homeland, the Lizardfolk's Line ensured that the battlelines could remain steadfast despite such restrictions. Lizardfolk companies fought in two-rank deep formations, often permitting their infantry to fire a dense volley before using the environment to fight in open order in prolonged exchanges. Although chaotic in greater numbers, the Lizardfolk Line could be supplemented with mutant soldiers and magic bombardments to allow them to openly control the pace of the battlefield."
 lizardfolk_23_raktayas_zky: "Raktayas Zky"
 lizardfolk_23_raktayas_zkyDESCR: "The Emperor's Thousand represented the most-gifted of the Rykyarasa, assigned based on their physical and military prowess to protect the Emperor and his many venerable naga administrators. With the primacy of firearms in the Sarhaly battlefield, these elites often adorned themselves with robust armour consisting of thick hides and metal plating, bolstering their imperviousness. In the battlefield, the Champions would be assigned as the vanguard of any ambitious lizardfolk assault, providing their lesser comrades with imperial inspiration and instilling utter terror in the hearts of the enemies forced to bear the brunt of their monstrous charge."
 lizardfolk_23_hippo_dragoons: "Greatmaw Deathchargers"
 lizardfolk_23_hippo_dragoonsDESCR: "Though an ajara could withstand a volley of bullets long enough for a successful breakthrough, the real issue came when cannons were rapidly adopted in the wars of Asarta and Rayza, which blew away the ajaras with but a single line of fire. Now a single regiment of ajaras could easily be wiped out at a single sounding of the cannons. In the deep jungles though, the sagely Rshak druid, Teranak Stonecarver, knew the exact way to counter this development; make the ajaras even bigger! Many militaries began to apply his military theory, employing talented druids to temporarily gigantify the cavalry just long enough to endure rains of cannonball and charge the artillery line."
 lizardfolk_26_agara_obash: "Agara Obash"
 lizardfolk_26_agara_obashDESCR: "For nearly a millennium, the lands of Horashesh of the former 332nd Empire had been lost to human conquest when the lizardfolk regressed into petty squabbling. With an united people and a mighty army, the 333rd Empire sought to reclaim their ancient bastions through force. The northern borders were swarmed with reclaimers, soldiers who not only openly welcomed the harsh savannah as land to be conquered and recolonized, but who also willingly mastered their ancestral territory to become thorns in their enemies' side. When the 333rd Empire demanded their old territories, the reclaimers would be the first to unleash chaos and battle upon the Khetfolk."
 lizardfolk_26_ayara_rykyarasa: "Ayara Rykyarasa"
 lizardfolk_26_ayara_rykyarasaDESCR: "What does victory mean to a lizardfolk? It is the domination of their enemy on the battlefield in intense combat. It became inevitable that the organized mutant brigades, who were continually exalted as the 333rd Empire's finest warriors, embraced this new heritage with profound dignity. The mutant brigades of future generations would cover their steel armour with enchanted surcoats and banners decorated with depictions of the battles which they had valiantly prevailed, inspiring the hearts of any lizardfolk regiment to fight as bravely,strongly and earnestly as possible."
 lizardfolk_28_hippo_legionaries: "Greatmaw Armorcrafts"
 lizardfolk_28_hippo_legionariesDESCR: "The use of ajaras in war would diverge as two large lizardfolk empires emerged. The northern empire, Adzalan, that held art in the highest of esteem, viewed ajara armorcraft as an artform. Thus their aspiring craftsmen have been in an armors race to design the greatest walking hulks of all. Ashhana ajaras began to be known for their strong, unbreakable armor that could crush even the sturdiest of walls between the combined weight of the animal and its armor."
 lizardfolk_28_hippo_cannons: "Zatstas Ajaras"
 lizardfolk_28_hippo_cannonsDESCR: "The 333rd empire, inspired by the success of Zatsutas artillery, mounted their ajaras with cannons. Their purpose was to break enemy lines even before charging and then following it up with a decimating charge that stomped down any survivors of the initial wave of cannonfire. Thisallowed ajaras to remain relevant even in the modern age, implemented widely into lizardfolk armies to adopt a more firearms-oriented style of warfare."
 lizardfolk_30_scaled_legionaries: "Scaled Legionaries"
 lizardfolk_30_scaled_legionariesDESCR: "Amongst the lizardfolk, one's toughness in battle is a cherished trait, one that uplifts many in their society. However, the bullets of the modern battlefield cared little for such a culture, forcing the lizardfolk to adapt to this harsh reality. As a result, lizardfolk began donning jackets combining thickly-folded layers of cloth with thin sheets of metal resembling the scales of their people, as protective gear for their vanguard troops. These vanguard troops would be sent alongside mutant brigades, providing supporting fire with determination and confidence in their hearts knowing that their metal scales would bring them great fortune in battle."
 lizardfolk_30_bashlitri_heavies: "Bashlitri Heavies"
 lizardfolk_30_bashlitri_heaviesDESCR: "Using artificery, mutant warriors quickly evolved to adapt to the firepower of the modern battlefield. Lizardfolk war engineers would develop the bashlitri, a magical-mechanical warsuit that maximized the firepower and durability of mutant warriors mighty enough to bear its weight. Covered in armoured steel plates ornately depicting their people's most venerable war heroes and battles and equipped with projectors that unleashed salvos of grapeshot, these rudimentary warsuits enabled ancient shock warfare to keep its stride and mightiness, defying the realities of the modern battlefield which was irreverent towards the traditional valiance of the lizardfolk."

 kobold_1_trappers: "Trappers"
 kobold_1_trappersDESCR: "The backbone of kobold warfare since time immemorial, trappers avoid losing standup fights with larger enemies by letting their foes come to them, straight onto their devious and deadly mechanisms. A few bitter ambushes make most enemies lose their taste for fighting."
 kobold_6_drake_riders: "Drake Riders"
 kobold_6_drake_ridersDESCR: "Kobolds had tamed drakes well before their recorded history, but the sacred nature of the dragonlike beasts meant risking them in warfare was taboo for centuries. However, in the face of human and gnomish incursion, desperate circumstances forced their handlers to attempt using drakes as combat cavalry. Their sheer effectiveness on the field helped shake this taboo."
 kobold_9_pikerunners: "Pike Runners"
 kobold_9_pikerunnersDESCR: "The first organized offensive kobold troops, the pike-runners used their stealth, agility, and pure moxie to duck right under the long pikes and weapons of their large opponents, striking brutal blows from beneath. While often costly and requiring close-quarters combat, the sheer determination of the pike-runners often put their larger foes off-guard."
 kobold_10_mounted_skirmishers: "Mounted Skirmishers"
 kobold_10_mounted_skirmishersDESCR: "As drakeback combat developed, the kobolds integrated their skirmishing tactics into their cavalry, with riders firing barrages of slingstones and arrows before clambering and scurrying back out of reach. One drake could carry an entire party of kobolds, making them all but impossible to ambush or flank"
 kobold_12_scions: "Scions"
 kobold_12_scionsDESCR: "Some kobolds are born larger, stronger, smarter, and braver than their fellows. Said among the kobolds to be blessed with the spirit of the dragons, the Scions gained in power as their size and strength became crucial to defending the kobold homelands."
 kobold_14_hoardcarts: "Hoardcarts"
 kobold_14_hoardcartsDESCR: "In the mid-1500s, particularly crafty and desperate kobold commanders began to use their own gold hoards as battle standards, hauled on drake-drawn carts in chests and piles. While this risked catastrophic loss of the hoard in the worst circumstances, any threat to the hoard would drive both kobold and drake to fight as though possessed."
 kobold_15_sappers: "Sappers"
 kobold_15_sappersDESCR: "Black powder revolutionized kobold engineering. Able to dig trenches, tunnels, stake pits, and spider holes faster than ever, the kobold sappers became terrors to their foes, able to appear as though from nowhere – usually with a bang – and turn even the hardest rocky terrain into a deathtrap."
 kobold_18_dragonflame_dreadnoughts: "Dragonflame Dreadnoughts"
 kobold_18_dragonflame_dreadnoughtsDESCR: "Kobold artificery developed the hoardcart into the ‘dreadnought', an armored wagon pulled by armored drakes and filled with skirmishers. Equipped with fire-projectors spewing sticky "dragonflame", the dreadnoughts became a crucial heavy punch for the kobold military, crashing into enemy lines ahead of the infantry and wreaking havoc. They would quickly become seen as a symbolic icon of the kobolds' military and industrial advancements."
 kobold_19_dragonbreath_pistoliers: "Dragonbreath Pistoliers"
 kobold_19_dragonbreath_pistoliersDESCR: "The first proper all-firearm kobold regiment was the Dragonbreath Pistoliers, kobolds wielding fire-shooting handguns. On the one hand, their incendiary ammunition was often dangerously unreliable, and required their shooters to get uncomfortably close. On the other, however, the deadliness of the fire-gouting guns struck fear into the kobolds' enemies, and the ability to shoot fire like a dragon bolstered their shooters' desire to fight."
 kobold_23_thousand_shooters: "Thousand Shooters"
 kobold_23_thousand_shootersDESCR: "The Thousand Shooters gave the world its first true taste of kobold mass tactics. Using two or three kobolds to each shoot a full-size musket, the Thousand Shooters packed hundreds of gun-teams into lines nearly a dozen deep. The result was a formation where no amount of casualties suffered could reduce the torrent of gunfire it spat at their enemies."
 kobold_23_reforged_drakes: "Reforged Drakes"
 kobold_23_reforged_drakesDESCR: "As the kobolds began mastering biomodification artificery, one of their first successes was "reforging" their beloved drakes, making them larger, stronger, and melding their armor and scales. Now tougher and more agile than ever, the reforged drakes became a devastating vanguard for the Thousand Shooters, their charge something no army in the world could ignore."
 kobold_26_reforged_scions: "Reforged Scions"
 kobold_26_reforged_scionsDESCR: "As kobold artifice grew in skill, the Scions returned to favor in combat. Given scales as tough as iron, steel claws, and muscles that could let them tear through gun-shields like paper, the morale effect of these four-foot dragons launching themselves into enemy lines like living sawtraps was horrific."
 kobold_28_thundersnares: "Thundersnares"
 kobold_28_thundersnaresDESCR: "The kobolds' oldest friend, the ambush, became infinitely more deadly with the addition of artificery to the mix. Lightning arcs, landmines, gouting dragonflame projectors, and remote mechanisms often meant entire companies would be ripped apart even before the actual kobold troops arrived."
 kobold_28_drakemaws: "Drakemaws"
 kobold_28_drakemawsDESCR: "Masterworks of bio-artificery, the drakemaws are living dreadnoughts – gigantic drakes with scales hard as steel, fiery breath, and an armored shell-compartment on their back. A cadre of pistoleers ride inside, protected, picking off any threat to their living juggernaut as it burns and tears through the enemy line."
 kobold_30_wyrmspawn: "Wyrmspawn"
 kobold_30_wyrmspawnDESCR: "Kobold mastery of biomodification allowed them to create the Wyrmspawn, among the deadliest artificer soldiery in Cannor. Standing nearly the size of a man, able to fly in bursts, breathe fire like a dragon, and shrug off bullets with their steel scales, the Wyrmspawn almost resemble walking dragons themselves more than kobolds. Every opponent who faces them comes away with nightmares of being caught between a thundersnare trapline and a one-kobold platoon."

 darkscale_kobold_1_copper_cutters: "Copper Cutters"
 darkscale_kobold_1_copper_cuttersDESCR: "When the Darkscales were driven into the backwaters of the treacherous Serpentspine following the death of Nimrith the Red, they desperately sought out strength to subsist amongst many hostile tribes and peoples. Harkening to the fading words of their master, the warriors amongst Darkscale clans would gather and melt scavenged copper and deluge themselves in the smoldering metal to unleash untapped strength from their bodies. Miraculously, many of these warriors were bestowed with hardened scales and sharpened claws through these strange rituals, becoming the core of the fanatic armies of the Darkscale clan."
 darkscale_kobold_6_salamander_riders: "Salamander Riders"
 darkscale_kobold_6_salamander_ridersDESCR: "Serpentspine salamanders are creatures who dwell in damp caverns throughout the Serpentspine. Despite being large and carnivorous, the Serpentspine salamander is surprisingly docile when well-fed which lends itself to being tameable. The Darkscales would tame the salamanders as war mounts, taking advantage of their barbed tails and wall-climbing to launch brutal ambushes upon their enemies. The effectiveness of these salamanders both protected the Darkscales and fed the salamanders with the flesh of their fallen enemies."
 darkscale_kobold_9_bronzeblade_battalions: "Bronzeblade Battalions"
 darkscale_kobold_9_bronzeblade_battalionsDESCR: "After securing a humble powerbase in the caves of the northern Serpentspine, the Darkscales were blessed with the discovery of derelict mines left by the dwarves of old. The kobolds adamantly resumed extraction, and soon, the production of bronze and iron to strengthen their people's military might. As a result, the next generation of Darkscale warriors would adopt bronze-scale rituals, further improving their bodies for battle when they could resist greater attacks and even fashion their claws into sword-like appendages that could tear through many enemies."
 darkscale_kobold_10_darkcliff_knights: "Darkcliff Knights"
 darkscale_kobold_10_darkcliff_knightsDESCR: "Unlike other war mounts, the Serpentspine salamander had exceptional regenerative properties which enabled it to regrow lost limbs and even detach its weaponized tail. Thus, it became common for salamanders to be used in short high-intensity shock charges, compensating for its dependence on wading in cave springs to remain hydrated. The Darkscales would maintain an experienced Ironskin company of salamander riders during long campaigns, sending them on flanking missions through cave cliffs to mask their approach before launching devastating attacks upon the distracted enemy."
 darkscale_kobold_12_ironskin_guardians: "Ironskin Guardians"
 darkscale_kobold_12_ironskin_guardiansDESCR: "With greater control over metal-making and their manpower issues, the armies of the Darkscales became more organized beyond their tribal foundations. One such example of their rapid development was the establishment of their first professional units that transcended tribal lines. The Ironskins were an experienced and war-hardened order of warriors originating from prestigious military clans with greater loyalty, martial prowess, and stronger iron-tempered bodies than the average Darkscale footsoldier. Always preparing for war, the Ironskins ensured that a second Scattering would never occur for the Darkscale kobolds."
 darkscale_kobold_14_silver_dragoons: "Silver Dragoons"
 darkscale_kobold_14_silver_dragoonsDESCR: "Salamander riders, seeking to maintain relevance in the rapidly-evolving battlefield, sought ways to improve their strength and firepower despite lacking gunpowder weapons. The Darkscales would train their salamander mounts to consistently spew fireballs at will, an ability that all Serpentspine salamanders latently shared when agitated in battle. This resulted in specialized companies of dragoons being born that provided the Darkscales with excellent skirmisher cavalry."
 darkscale_kobold_15_nimrithan_faithful: "Nimrithan Faithful"
 darkscale_kobold_15_nimrithan_faithfulDESCR: "Lacking gunpowder weapons, the Darkscales extensively explored alchemy as a means of bolstering the strength of their footsoldiers. As a result of their war alchemy, the Darkscales discovered a vile concoction they named Nimrith-ash that devoured both flesh and steel if aggravated with fire. The Darkscales would pack flammable bags filled with Nimrith-ash, sending their bravest soldiers to ignite and throw these projectiles against enemy formations. The blazes produced by the seething globules of Nimrith-ash would devour the terrain as if Nimrith himself unleashed his fury upon the battlefield."
 darkscale_kobold_18_magma_marauders: "Magma Marauders"
 darkscale_kobold_18_magma_maraudersDESCR: "Evolving alchemy and artificery of the Darkscales guaranteed that their salamander mounts would inevitably transform to suit their military needs. Bio-artificery allowed the Darkscales to replicate their molten rituals upon their salamander mounts, liberating them from their skin's dependency on water and granting them a new level of durability which rendered them fireproof. With their natural strength and fire-breathing, magma salamander riders were capable of joining the fray of battle in combined arms maneuvers to provide excellent firepower and cavalry support to the Darkscales' infantry."
 darkscale_kobold_19_molten_onslaught_infantry: "Molten Onslaught Infantry"
 darkscale_kobold_19_molten_onslaught_infantryDESCR: "Seeking the wisdom from the no-scales who dwelled within their territory, the Darkscales adopted the flame pressurizers that goblin artificers once crafted to melt their scales and flesh in battle. The Darkscales would produce sleeker burners with barrels made of special heat-resistant alloys that their alchemists discovered to enable their vanguard troops to unleash incendiary slime upon their enemies in close quarters combat. Although the intensity of these burners guaranteed that the resilience of their scales would be brutally tested, these weapons greatly enhanced the firepower of the Darkscales despite lacking gunpowder."
 darkscale_kobold_23_alloyed_auxiliaries: "Alloyed Auxiliaries"
 darkscale_kobold_23_alloyed_auxiliariesDESCR: "The ever-increasing complexity of the Darkscales' cave mining schemes promoted greater exploration on alloying to improve the quality of their tools and scales. As a result, once-exclusive ironskin became cheaper and more accessible to the next generation of Darkscale warriors. With many new warriors embracing iron alloy scales, the Ironskins grew immensely and effectively supplanted the traditional clan warhosts as the Darkscales' means of mobilizing and training military forces as warfare in the Serpentspine became more deadly and unpredictable. "
 darkscale_kobold_23_firefang_dreadnoughts: "Firefang Dreadnoughts"
 darkscale_kobold_23_firefang_dreadnoughtsDESCR: "The magma salamander continued to artificially evolve through constant bio-modification by the Darkscales, making them stronger, faster, and more resilient than ever before. The dreadnought salamander was one such breakthrough in bio-artificery, which accelerated its body's regenerative properties; not only were their bodies sturdier, but the barbs on their tails could be magically agitated to be fired like shrapnel. When combined with the magma they internally produced, dreadnought salamanders could plow through battalions after bombarding them with fire breath and shrapnel which filled the roads and caverns of the Serpentspine."
 darkscale_kobold_26_platinated_corps: "The Platinated Corps"
 darkscale_kobold_26_platinated_corpsDESCR: "When iron alloy scales became predominant amongst the Darkscales' soldiers, the old guard of elite military families sought to further enhance themselves to differentiate themselves from the masses. Discovering old stashes of platinum scattered near Haraz Orldhûm, the scions of legacy Ironskins augmented themselves by covering themselves in platinum scales, enhancing their durability and strength beyond the common warriors. Petitioning to the Darkscales' leadership for special privileges in exchange for their continued service, the Platinated Corps was created as an elite vanguard force that wielded Nimrith-ash projectors forged by the country's finest artificers."
 darkscale_kobold_28_knights_of_molten_drake: "Knights of the Molten Drake"
 darkscale_kobold_28_knights_of_molten_drakeDESCR: "Although the Darkscales lacked drakes, they strived to emulate their power through their profound understanding of bio-artificery. The salamanders that once protected the hovels of the Darkscale clan were unrecognizable, transformed into draconic beasts that could unleash salvos of devastating missiles, spew carbonizing flames, and withstand any weapon fired against them. Those who raised and controlled these war machines became a new elite force in Darkscale military organization, modern knights who commanded the power of fire and the immense potency of their salamanders to serve their late master: Nimrith the Red."
 darkscale_kobold_28_red_wings_of_reprisal: "Red Wings of Reprisal"
 darkscale_kobold_28_red_wings_of_reprisalDESCR: "Hearing of the vast potential of artificery in the field of bio-modification, the Darkscales embraced the ideas of their distant cousins in order to further emulate the likeness of their late master Nimrith the Red. To better adjust to the environment of the caverns of the Serpentspine, the Darkscales' scions grafted wide patagia onto their limbs; equipped with air-powered launchers to gain momentum, these scions could glide deep into the battlefield and scatter incendiary bombs upon their enemies. These scions would be known as the Red Wings, for their bodies were painted with deep red dye to emulate Nimrith."
 darkscale_kobold_30_nimriths_brood: "Nimrith's Brood"
 darkscale_kobold_30_nimriths_broodDESCR: "The bio-modification of the Darkscales gradually became more ambitious and obsessive in pursuit of emulating Nimrith the Red. The Darkscales' scions approached the likeness and power of their former master: every improvement upon alloying ensured their scales became more invulnerable, every innovation in bio-artificery brought them closer to aerial and physical superiority, every upgrade to their Nimrith-ash projectors made them more self-sustaining and devastating. Eventually, even the most skeptical couldn't deny the draconic similitude of the modern Darkscale scion, for they wholly replicated Nimrith's likeness on the scorched battlefield."

 triunic_26_sakhlynbhu_lineDESCR: "Using their great populations to their advantage, the northern cities gathered their armies into great walls of men, 7 ranks deep. They would quickly fire a handful of volleys, passing the rifles to the rearmost ranks to reload faster. After the volleys had been unleashed, bayonets would be fixed and the army would charge into melee range. Enemy armies would either be stunned by the sheen of their cuirasses and flee in terror or be drowned in a sea of blood and steel."

 triunic_26_mashoqoqov_companiesDESCR: "To counter cavalry charges, the Sayqhavat line was combined with the Tähsaarn system, splitting the line into 5 seperate units in a star formation. Each unit would be flanked by cannons that would fire explosive shells against the opposing cavalry, switching to shrapnel shot when the enemy closed in."

 triunic_28_ultaqharuul_cuirassiersDESCR: "art of Agaach Oqaryezin's army reforms, the Federation begins moving away from using Orachav clans for their cavalry, relegating them to auxiliary status. A new corp of cavalrymen made up of the sons of wealthy families is raised, armed with rifles, pistols, and sabers and armored with a golden cuirass and mask. They undergo a similarly grueling training regimen to the regulars. Their usual tactic is to skirt the enemy flanks while firing upon them, once the infantry begins to advance they charge, scattering the opposition in preparation for the infantry's bayonets."
 triunic_30_taivaapiirmic_sojdalas: "Täivaapiirmic Sojdalas"
 triunic_30_taivaapiirmic_sojdalasDESCR: "With the rush of volunteers eager to join the ranks of the legendary Qarshtyilagd, the training academies are swamped. Unable to train all of the new recruits but unwilling to turn them all away, the army is split between those that manage to go through the full training and those that take a stripped down version of it. Fully trained officers are given a mustached facemask to differentiate them from the "babefaced" enlisted. The first 2 ranks are made up of the elite, who accurately gun down the enemy before passing the rifles back to the enlisted to reload. After a series of volleys have been unleashed, the massive army charges with bayonets to bury the enemy in Triunic steel. What the Federation cannot outgun or outmaneuver, it will outman and overwhelm."
 triunic_30_qarshtyilagd_regulars: "Qarshtyilagd Regulars"
 triunic_30_qarshtyilagd_regularsDESCR: "As the population of Federation boomed, a military theorist known as Agaach Oqaryezin from Qarshtuluu began reforming and standardizing the infantry. The cuirasses were done away with, replaced with highly reflective vests. Their facemasks were standardized and mass produced, and blue greatcoats were issued to the rank and file. Agaach created a brutal and strict training regimen to instill discipline and patriotism within the new armies, creating a force of men that could stare down a charging centaur with a grin and a laugh."

 taychendi_1_sabre_warriors: "Sabre Warriors"
 taychendi_1_sabre_warriorsDESCR: "The Sabre Warriors of Larankar serve as a more disciplined version of the levies found elsewhere in Taychend. Hailing from the hilly and mountainous northern highlands, the Sabre Warriors are generally of a hardier stock than their southern brethren. Utilizing the preferred weapons of the Larankar, iron sabres, and a vision and discipline less readily found in the rest of Taychend, Sabre Warriors are less easily broken in battle and more cohesive in their formations. This cohesion does come at a cost, losing some of the offensive potential of the chaotic, sprawling Levy armies, but the Sabre Warriors serve a greater vision."
 taychendi_1_yodhan_levies: "Yodhan Levies"
 taychendi_1_yodhan_leviesDESCR: "As a region torn by constant warfare and Warlordism, Taychend's primary form of military organization has for centuries been centered around levies loyal to their "Yodhan," or local warlord. Experienced in the ways of war, most levies wield iron swords or spears. The resource rich lands of Taychend ensure that virtually all Taychendi have access to quality weapons - and the constant state of war ensures experience from a young age. The levies rely more on sheer numbers to overrun their enemies than any maneuvering or tactics, and may dissolve quickly if their Yodhan falls, fleeing to the service of whoever offers them food, safety, and victory. In great numbers, the Yodhan Levies are a fearsome and chaotic force."
 taychendi_1_swarm_riders: "Matirai"
 taychendi_1_swarm_ridersDESCR: "The Yodhan of the Taychendi prized their cavalry for its mobility and maneuverability, but approached their mounted forces in a similarly chaotic way to their infantry levies. Taychendi "Matirai" (translated to common as Horse Riders) focused on overwhelming their enemies with numbers, swiftly flanking their enemies and overrunning them with similar terrifying mass tactics. The lack of strong Cannorian horses left the Taychendi mostly reliant on light cavalry, making them effective messengers and mobile riders, but less effective at charging their opponents."
 taychendi_1_mounted_sabres: "Mounted Sabres"
 taychendi_1_mounted_sabresDESCR: "The Mounted Sabres of Larankar were unique among the Taychendi cavalry for understanding the importance and value of group cohesion alongside maneuverability. While losing some of the terror that came with swarms of Taychendi throwing their horses at enemy levies, the Sabre Warriors maintained formation and utilized their favored sabres to great effect, dismounting to engage enemy forces and withstanding enemy charges without dissolving. Further, the highland peoples of Larankar possessed breeds of horse stockier and stronger than the light lowland horses, allowing them to use rudimentary horse armor to protect their mounts. These tactics proved essential in maintaining Larankar's hold over the region."
 taychendi_5_amarawors_chosen: "Amarawor's Chosen"
 taychendi_5_amarawors_chosenDESCR: "The elite of the Larankar army, Amarawor's Chosen represent the Sabre Warriors who have shown bravery, loyalty, and discipline in the service of Amarawor Erankar the Unifier and his descendants. United by a vision of a Taychend unified under Larankarha rule, Amarawor's Chosen have honed the Sabre Warrior art to create elite units capable of breaking the morale of their often unorganized opponents. Their Taychendi parentage is still apparent despite their more honed approach, as they do not shy from bringing the fight to their enemies, even when seemingly outmatched."
 taychendi_5_hired_katti: "Hired Katti"
 taychendi_5_hired_kattiDESCR: "he Hired "Katti" (translated to common as swords) are mercenaries hired by the rulers of the Taychendi Kingdoms to assist in the seemingly never ending conflicts that plague the region. Having distinguished themselves in battle for their local Yodhan, the Hired Katti are drawn from the more skilled ranks of the more undisciplined levies. Having proven they could survive and thrive in the chaotic lands of Taychend, the Katti now enjoy the patronage of rulers to train and supplement the levies, and supply a more loyal and stable core to the often fickle and fleeting levies of the Yodhan."
 taychendi_6_taychendi_horse_archers: "Taychendi Horse Archers"
 taychendi_6_taychendi_horse_archersDESCR: "The abundance of light cavalry in Taychend led to innovations in mounted tactics, chief among them the rapid ascent of horse archery as an effective tactic in warfare. The chaotic nature of Taychendi warfare significantly raised the value of skirmishers, especially as a tactic to remain engaged with swarms of Taychendi levies without being overrun. The light cavalry of the region were well suited to just such an adaptation, and few Yodhan would dare go into battle without a complement of mounted archers to supplement their forces."
 taychendi_6_larankar_lancers: "Larankar Lancers"
 taychendi_6_larankar_lancersDESCR: "Larankar's cavalry followed a different evolution than the rest of Taychend, transforming their Sabre Riders into something approximating heavy cavalry found elsewhere. Their stronger horses relative to their lowland counterparts gave the Lancers the ability to readily shock enemy forces into rapidly dissolving, and to withstand the swarm tactics of enemy levies to greater effect. As such, the "Larankar Lancers," distinguished themselves as the most effective cavalry in Taychend, able to contend with Katti, Horse Archers, or foreign adversaries."
 taychendi_9_tenvachi_spears: "Tenvachi Spears"
 taychendi_9_tenvachi_spearsDESCR: "Increased exposure to the Kheionai "Phalanx" style of combat formation practiced by the Ambhen led the Taychendi state of Vul Tenvach to begin to adapt these tactics with their own levy forces. The resultant "Tenvachi Spears" utilize similar weapons and combat tactics of the Kheionai, but staffed by native Taychendi soldiers. Lacking somewhat in the discipline and experience of their Ambhen counterparts, the Tenvachi Spears offer greater offensive potential borne from the fearsome and chaotic nature of Taychendi warfare."
 taychendi_9_highlander_companies: "Highlander Companies"
 taychendi_9_highlander_companiesDESCR: "The Highlander Companies of the Northern Taychend remain true to their Larankhara heritage - utilizing mostly the Sabres of their forebears, increasingly organized and disciplined through a rare period of stability in Taychend. Utilized throughout the region to maintain order, the Highlander Companies are especially valued for their use in guarding the borders of the encroaching Ambhen invaders - though both are viewed suspiciously by the other Taychendi. They serve as the backbone of Larankarha rule over the other Taychendi peoples."
 taychendi_10_mahred_varyana_flankers: "Marhed Rayodana Flankers"
 taychendi_10_mahred_varyana_flankersDESCR: "Sacrificing armor and strength, the Marhed Rayodana Flankers were renowned for their speed, rumored to be able to traverse distances thought impossible for mortal beings. Their secret lay in the utilization of small, fast, nearly entirely unencumbered horses and the presence of "deserts" (actually dried up lakes) near their Kingdom, using speed and seemingly impassable terrain to appear behind enemy armies to launch devastating surprise attacks on their rear. Even when less able to obscure their formations with friendly terrain, the swiftness of their horses and seeming omnipresence struck fear in the hearts of their enemies, and led Marhed Rayodana to many surprise victories."
 taychendi_10_lamellar_riders: "Lamellar Riders"
 taychendi_10_lamellar_ridersDESCR: "The Lamellar Riders of the Larankar paralleled in many ways the Cannorian style of armed knights, equipping their horses with heavy armor in a manner unsuitable for the fleeter horses found to the South. Fully armored and designed to charge enemy formations, the Lamellar Riders were an attempt by the Larankar to develop a cavalry force capable of breaking the powerful Kheionai phalanx formations of the Ameioni. While the Highland horses may have been inferior to their Cannorian counterparts, the ferocity and offensive inclination of Taychendi warriors made charging enemy forces hardly a foreign or uncomfortable concept, and the terrifying offensive potential of these units was noted by their foes."
 taychendi_12_urvand_honorbound: "Urvand Honorbound"
 taychendi_12_urvand_honorboundDESCR: "As Larankara armies were crushed by the Sun Elf invasion, the forces of the Larankarha capital of Urvand stood as the last defense of all Larankhara faith, culture, and heritage. Only after the city was conquered and sacked by the Sun Elves and their Taychendi allies did the Sun Elf invasion falter, as the Taychendi refused to submit fully to Sun Elf rule. The Urvand Honorbound who served before, during, and after the invasion prided themselves on the loyalty to their people - never having sought an alliance with foreigners or engaged in any treachery to their people. Fighting doggedly against overwhelming odds, the Honorbound proved a determination and discipline far and above their other Taychendi counterparts. Even after the withdrawal of the invaders, the Urvand Honorbound became renowned for their ability to withstand enemy charges and maintain the fight against difficult odds, rarely retreating in the face of danger."
 taychendi_12_orenkoraim_arquebusiers: "Orenkoraim Arquebusiers"
 taychendi_12_orenkoraim_arquebusiersDESCR: "Among the Taychendi Kingdoms, the Kingdom of Orenkoraim proved most open to foreign trade and ideas. This openness led to the import of the first foreign firearms into Taychend through Orenkoraim's ports, organizing the first arquebusiers regiments. Constructed abroad, the weapons found great use by all parties within Taychend - be they internal conflicts between Taychendi, Taychendi resisting Sun Elf invasions, or the growing tensions between Ambhen and Taychendi. As Orenkoraim avoided most of the devastation of the Sun Elf invasions, the Kingdom became both a center for trade and a nexus for arms and mercenaries seeking to repel the invaders."
 taychendi_14_kalavend_caracole: "Kalavend Caracole"
 taychendi_14_kalavend_caracoleDESCR: "The proliferation of firearms in Taychend resulted in the creation of Caracole units, much in the style of the horse archers of old. The light and agile Taychendi horses served the purpose of armed horseback combat well, developing Caracole formations early in Taychend's military development. The Kalavendi in particular extensively practiced this tactic - charging at enemy forces in rows, discharging one firearm, turning to discharge the other, then retreating to the back row to reload, gradually advancing on opposing formations. With ideal mounts and battle hardened riders, the Kalavend Caracole could unleash devastating losses on their opponents."
 taychendi_15_fotistrepei_immitations: "Fotistrépei Immitations"
 taychendi_15_fotistrepei_immitationsDESCR: "As the Ameioni forces filled the power vacuum left by the devastating Sun Elf invasions, the crumbling Taychendi Kingdoms sought to imitate their invaders and adopt their tactics in order to resist. The Fotistrépei of the Ameoini were kheionized Taychendi offered land and privilege for their services to provide a native force for their invasion, and the Taychendi states increasingly imitated this system in order to staff and organize their armies along similarly efficient lines. The degree to which this was successful varied, but represented an important innovation of both resistance and intermixing of the two cultures."
 taychendi_15_nanru_nakar_cityguards: "Nanru Nakar Cityguards"
 taychendi_15_nanru_nakar_cityguardsDESCR: "With the collapse of most of the Taychendi Kingdoms and the eclipsing of the once mighty Larankar, the now united city of Nanru Nakar became the focal point for Taychendi military and economic power. The Nanru Nakar Cityguards became the exemplars of order in a region largely forged by chaos, and the only force formidable enough to offer any level of resistance to the Ameoini invasion. Well staffed by the burgeoning population of the city, and equipped by its immense mercantile trade, the Cityguards represented an effective force - be they as defenders of the city, or as mercenaries to the other Taychendi Kingdoms fighting the Ameioni invaders."
 taychendi_18_orenkoraim_cuirassiers: "Orenkoraim Cuirassiers"
 taychendi_18_orenkoraim_cuirassiersDESCR: "While Taychendi horses served as ideal mounts for skirmishing and irregular combat tactics, the Orenkoraim found them no substitute for stronger and sturdier Cannorian mounts. Facing increasingly long odds and difficult to dislodge Kheionai pikemen and grenadiers, the Orenkoraim imported massive amounts of Cannorian horses and bred them to create elite Cuirassiers units, staffed and trained by Cannorian mercenaries. Finally abandoning lances and focusing on saber and pistol combat with lighter armed riders atop stronger steeds, the Orenkoraim Cuirassiers were able to inflict heavy losses on opposing infantry formations."
 taychendi_19_clematar_square: "Clematar Square"
 taychendi_19_clematar_squareDESCR: "The increasing aggression of the cat-riding Chendhyans forced innovation among the Taychendi, with the Clemetar serving as the first line of defense against their incursions. The agile and deadly cat-like cavalry units necessitated a new form of defense, and Clemetar militaries quickly adopted an infantry square formation that would be known as the "Clemetar Square." By forming an outward facing perimeter and securing all possible flanks of their infantry formations, the Taychendhi severely hampered the Chendhyans' ability to destroy their battle lines with powerful feline mounts."
 taychendi_19_sibisimra_skirmishers: "Sibisimra Skirmishers"
 taychendi_19_sibisimra_skirmishersDESCR: "Sibisimra resisted Ameioni invasion fiercely, never truly falling entirely to their rule. Among their more effective tactics for resistance was to avoid pitched battle against their largely superior foes - focusing instead on irregular and agile formations, dissolving and reforming when placed on the defensive. This proved particularly effective against more orthodox Ameoini military maneuvers, and allowed Sibisimra and similar Taychendi states to extend their resistance, and inflict considerable casualties on the foreign incursion."
 taychendi_23_kalavendhi_gun_brigades: "Kalavendhi Gun Brigades"
 taychendi_23_kalavendhi_gun_brigadesDESCR: "With foreign weapons well available in Taychend, the line infantry tactics of abroad were fully adopted by many of the Taychendi states. Along the lower Kalavendhi in particular, brigades of infantry lining up to face their opponents became the standard tactic, especially as the gap in technology and innovation between Ameoini and Taychendi began to narrow. A region already rich in both resources and manpower, war only focused the boons of Taychend into nearly endless lines of infantry ready to repel the Ameoini invaders."
 taychendi_23_royakottar_vanguard: "Royakottar Vanguard"
 taychendi_23_royakottar_vanguardDESCR: "Founded on the front lines between the great Taychendi states and the Ameioni invaders, the Royakottar distinguished themselves as fierce warriors, and adopted tactics designed to withstand the punishing onslaught of the Ameioni invasion. Chief among their innovations was the creation of the "Royakottar Vanguard," elite units that stood at the front of the battle lines. Ready to absorb enemy charges and bravely withstand the initial volleys of an engagement, their superior discipline and training ensured the survival of the formation - and that their units would inflict disproportionate casualties on all opposing lines."
 taychendi_23_nanru_nakar_dragoons: "Nanru Nakar Dragoons"
 taychendi_23_nanru_nakar_dragoonsDESCR: "With limited availability of Cannorian imports compared to the Orenkoraim, the Nanru Nakar Dragoons relied on their traditional swift Taychendi horses to produce units of skirmishing cavalry designed to harass opposing forces. This proved devastating to the Ameioni, as skirmishing tactics by the Taychendi whittled down their forces in an increasingly one-sided war of attrition. The Dragoons were particularly adept at this, utilizing their mounts to evade capture and open battle, hitting supply lines, vulnerable holes in defensive formations, key geographic areas, and any other targets considered valuable in a war of maneuver. With less focus on cavalry charges and serving as more of a form of mobile infantry, the dragoons could wield heavier rifles and inflict considerably higher casualties than their pistol-wielding forebears."
 taychendi_26_mahred_varyana_grenadiers: "Marhed Rayodana Grenadiers"
 taychendi_26_mahred_varyana_grenadiersDESCR: "Invigorated by the continued deterioration of the Ameioni invasions, and channeling the aggressive and chaotic Taychendi heritage, the Grenadiers of Marhed Varanya distinguished themselves as the most effective offensive formations in all of Taychend. Wielding early forms of artificer-enhanced hand grenades, the Grenadiers tore apart Ameoni formations and led charges with such vigor not seen since the days of the Yodhan centuries before. Service in the grenadiers required considerable stature, fortitude, and bravery on a scale approaching recklessness."
 taychendi_26_yodhanpir_irregulars: "Yodhanpir Irregulars"
 taychendi_26_yodhanpir_irregularsDESCR: "Ever facing daunting odds, the Taychendi had resorted to irregular tactics and skirmishing since the early days of the Ambhen conquests, and changes in technology and tactics had only served to enhance their ability to harass the invaders. A key advantage the Taychendi had over their Ambhen opponents was that of numbers - and in the ensuing wars of attrition, the Taychendi would ultimately emerge victorious. The use of irregular forces loyal to local Yodhans, never truly pacified by the Ambhen or their servants, ensured that any overwhelming military advantage enjoyed by the Ambhen would slowly whittle away in the face of occupation and endless engagements."
 taychendi_28_degithioni_carabiniers: "Degithioni Carabiniers"
 taychendi_28_degithioni_carabiniersDESCR: "Wielding a light carbine rifle, the Degithioni Carabiners represented the latest form of mobile infantry innovation in the Taychend. Ruled by an Ameioni ruler who deferred most aspects of cavalry to his Taychendi subjects, Degithioni would come to typify the synthesis of Ameioni and Taychendi military thought. The small and agile Taychendi horses would be ridden by Taychendi but organized along Ameioni lines, with small but disciplined Carabiner units seeking to flank and harass enemy formations much like the later Échate or Klecherand Infantry."
 taychendi_30_klerechend_infantry: "Klerechend Infantry"
 taychendi_30_klerechend_infantryDESCR: "A synthesis of Ambhen and Taychendi culture, the Kleyeren similarly adopted Ambhen military tactics. More defensively oriented than their pure-blooded Taychendi cousins, the Klecherend infantry were also more conservative in their reliance on artificery, more similar to the Échate League Infantry of the remnant Ameioni forces. These forces relied on superior equipment and training to prevail over their opponents, approaching combat with units able to divide into smaller components to distract, flank, and avoid their enemies, only to reform into a large force in more advantageous terrain. This flexibility made dislodging such formations extremely difficult, and opponents often found themselves facing a combined formation in one direction - only to have it reform at their flanks, or their rear."
 taychendi_30_triple_alliance_infantry: "Triple Alliance Infantry"
 taychendi_30_triple_alliance_infantryDESCR: "The "Triple Alliance" of the Taychendi nations of Marhed Rayodana, Nanru Nakar, and Royakattar produced some of the most feared offensive formations found in Taychend. The infantry of these nations were enhanced by the presence of immoral artificers - willing to utilize any and all available technology to gain a competitive advantage, regardless of the cost. Forged by over a century of resistance to foreign invasion, the offensively oriented Triple Alliance Infantry equipped their soldiers with all the tools necessary to tear through enemy forces with a ferocity unmatched by any potential opponents. Infantry were known to yield explosives, enhanced spark rifles with explosive rounds, and battlesuits adorned and enhanced with images of the Taychendi gods."

 ynnsmen_1_adventurer_bands: "Adventurer Bands"
 ynnsmen_1_adventurer_bandsDESCR: "Many peoples, from all walks of life, set foot upon the new and mysterious world as they climbed the treacherous Cliffs of Ruin to escape the unravelling Old World into a new age of history. Despite the vast differences of these trailblazers in motivations, experience, and cultural values, all were united by the harsh reality that the new world which they set foot upon was completely foreign and unrecognisable, even to the elves who once called it their motherland. With these challenges in mind, these pioneers diligently fought to fulfil their ambitions using the experiences from their unique backgrounds, aided by veteran explorer-captains who lended their leadership and talents gained from extensively serving in Cannorian conflicts."
 ynnsmen_1_light_raiders: "Light Raiders"
 ynnsmen_1_light_raidersDESCR: "If a wagon train gets raided and nobody lives to tell the tale, can the government send troops without causing a war? In the limitless flatlands of Aelantir, a resounding "No" echoed through the lush grass with no Ynnsman or Ruinborn to hear such a cruel answer. Many of the first cavalry bands, mercenaries or otherwise, took advantage of their mounts' speed to launch swift and brutal attacks upon isolated targets, which were far removed from any hope of assistance. Settlements were ransacked, outposts were burned, and wagon trains disappeared, leaving the galloping of the first Ynnsman raiders resonating through the open fields."
 ynnsmen_5_pioneers: "Pioneers"
 ynnsmen_5_pioneersDESCR: "Humble settlements emerged, maps became clearer, and harvests were celebrated in the nascent polities born from the tide of adventurers journeying west. However, new challenges emerged as doubts were about to be placated. Not only were the veteran adventurers growing old and grey, but the indigenous inhabitants of their claimed territories became more competitive and hostile towards their continued expansion. Thus, veteran explorer-captains took initiative in training militias in their ways of war, to ensure that their ambitious projects would remain steadfast, even as their military experience faded away to time."
 ynnsmen_6_cattle_herders: "Cattle Herders"
 ynnsmen_6_cattle_herdersDESCR: "Cattle were a precious commodity in the Ynnic region, especially when there were plentiful pastures for them to graze and roam. Easy to guide to a burgeoning settlement, but also easier to steal once you kill their drivers; perfect for any bandit to make a small fortune. Many mercenaries found easy work from this issue, able to extract huge fees from ranchers and wagon trains in exchange for providing reconnaissance and defence against raiders. Often armed with composite bows and occasionally matchlock pistols, these herders were often well-practised in mounted skirmishing, which enabled them to effectively assist their clients."
 ynnsmen_9_free_bands: "Free Bands"
 ynnsmen_9_free_bandsDESCR: "As the original explorer-captains passed away along with their seasoned soldiers, early Ynnsman states were forced to find new ways to fend for themselves. In polities dominated by peasants such as the Beggaston, this meant devolving national defence responsibilities to the homesteaders and villagers who cultivated and developed the land. As such, it became common for the peasantry to autonomously establish their own militias and independently manage their own training, equipping, and deployment as soldiers in times of conflict. Combining the teachings of Cannorian warfare and their experiences in the frontier, these communal militias were often a settlement's only defence against banditry."

 ynnsmen_9_istranari_crusadersDESCR: "Sybille Lánchs' expedition to vanquish Drozma Tur was seen as overzealous, and to some, a sign of worse things to come from Corinism; but it was certainly not underprepared. She rallied support throughout Cannor, promising to defeat the evils which scourged faraway Ynn. When the icebreakers ploughed through the Broken Sea, her crusaders fervently marched south equipped with the latest arquebuses and with intense fervour, refined from decades of experience. With gunfire and the panicked terror of the ruinborn piercing through the crisp cool air, the Istanari Crusade caused untold devastation upon northern Ynn in the name of Corin; such violence wouldn't be surpassed until the Red Year of 1787."
 ynnsmen_9_privates: "Privates"
 ynnsmen_9_privatesDESCR: "When the separation between government forces and a new colony is a boundless, featureless grassland, it is no surprise that the emerging Ynnsman states struggled to assert authority and order over their claimed territories. In such a dire power vacuum, newly arrived adventurers and roaming mercenaries formed private companies to viciously fill the need for national security, creating a cartel-like stranglehold over the regions they served. Lacking any masters and often any morals, many of these "privates" demanded steep "payments" from those they protected; but in the unpredictable and violent countryside of the Expanse, few dared to throw themselves to the hungry wolves when there was safety and order in reach."
 ynnsmen_10_cowboys: "Cowboys"
 ynnsmen_10_cowboysDESCR: "The cowboy referred to animal herders who lived throughout the Ynnic flatlands. Used to the unpredictable environment of the Ynnic countryside, the Ynnsman cowboy was expected to be a seasoned marksman and an excellent equestrian should war rear its ugly head upon their property and their communities. Taking advantage of the decreasing weight of muskets, many cowboys often fought on horseback, tasking their ranch hands to cyclically reload their firearms like squires. With many cowboys being raised in the Epednan Expanse, Ynnsman states often hired them to serve on short military expeditions as auxiliary skirmishers and sharpshooters."
 ynnsmen_12_rudmen: "Rudmen"
 ynnsmen_12_rudmenDESCR: "Rudmen, or literally river-men, were a group of half-orcish trappers and hunters who roamed the lands between the Cursed Forest to Veykoda. Vital in the Freemarches' control of the Cursed Forest, they would often spend as much time in skirmishes against other Cannorians and Cursed Ones as they would hunting. Regardless of foe, by applying their skills in fieldcraft, marksmanship and traversing through rough terrain, the Rudmen ensured that any intruders upon their territory would be constantly tracked and harassed in a gruelling and unwinnable guerilla war."
 ynnsmen_12_ynnsmen_thorns: "Ynnsmen Thorns"
 ynnsmen_12_ynnsmen_thornsDESCR: "The thorn formation, which was propagated through Cannorian military thinking shipped by the settlers, struggled to assert similar dominance in the Epednan Expanse. The warfare fought by the nomadic Epednar people and general logistical shortcomings simply rendered such massed formations exceptionally challenging to use. Thus, when the Ynnsmen continued to travel westwards to establish new homesteads, the settlers adapted such tactics by moving their supply wagons in a circular formation as fortifications to protect their vital livestock and their musketeers. The latter would then drive away the Epednar raiders and ensure safe passage through the Expanse."
 ynnsmen_14_hired_rangers: "Hired Rangers"
 ynnsmen_14_hired_rangersDESCR: "Ynnsman rangers were a peculiar breed of wanderer, lacking the depravity and criminality of marauding bandits while not being helpless as wandering vagrants. Many seemed to prefer the simple nomadic lifestyle while roaming the Ynnic grasslands, but often never ignored the opportunity of the prospect of mercenary contracts. Elusive, well-learned in Ynnic geography, and exceptional combatants, mounted rangers could serve a myriad of specialised roles that a Ynnsman army often lacked from its regular infantry as saboteurs, scouts, trappers, and mounted skirmishers."
 ynnsmen_15_epednan_square: "Epednan Square"
 ynnsmen_15_epednan_squareDESCR: "The whirlwind rise of light cavalry as the scourge of the flat Epednan Expanse outpaced and overwhelmed conventional Ynnsman Thorns tactics, which were too slow to effectively repel raiders before fortifications could be established by its civilian users. Instead, Ynnsman armies began to employ hollowed square formations amongst their drilled soldiers to address the clunkiness and inefficiencies of the antiquated wagon forts. Known as the Epednan Square, it enabled Ynnsman armies to quickly manoeuvre troops to withstand and deflect incoming cavalry charges. Meanwhile, the musketeers, from the safety behind these disciplined formations, could effectively drive away the cavalry using concentrated salvos of gunfire."

 ynnsmen_15_themarian_greycoatsDESCR: "The Themarennic people's vibrant coastal culture lent itself to becoming a boon for navigating and conquering the vast northern Broken Isles. Leveraging their maritime traditions, the Themarians were able to effectively traverse the riverbanks and rapids while remaining combat effective at all times in any terrain in northern Aelantir, from frigid tundra to lush forests. Known as the Greycoats for their attire, these marines served as the core of Themeria's control over the river networks of the Forest of the Cursed Ones as veteran infantry that were masters of amphibious warfare and raiding."
 ynnsmen_15_vagrant_conscripts: "Vagrant Conscripts"
 ynnsmen_15_vagrant_conscriptsDESCR: "What really makes a good soldier? To some, discipline and strict obedience, to others, martial skill and experience, but to a few, nothing as long as they are willing to fight. Mass Cannorian immigration and with it, the squalid underclass flowed into the Veykodan Overlands. Regardless of social status or even criminality, many found aid in emerging Ynnsman states such as the bandit Kingdom of New Havoral, in exchange for unyielding servitude to their rulers. Appealing to their wildest dreams and whims, these scum were quickly integrated into burgeoning armies, filling their reserves with fresh manpower. Ill-disciplined and gutless as these conscripts were, such mockery was immaterial when cascades of musket-fire filled the Ynnic air, miraculously securing victories against their outnumbered adversaries."
 ynnsmen_18_expanse_riders: "Expanse Riders"
 ynnsmen_18_expanse_ridersDESCR: "Many Expanse Ynnsman states strove to create their own ranger units for permanent and consistent service. Known as expanse riders, these units often recruited trappers, downtrodden rangers, and woodsmen in order to leverage their myriads of skills to provide reconnaissance, sharpshooting, and effective skirmishing in various conflicts. With many of these units being subordinate to larger military formations, they were often found being used in loose caracole-type tactics against slower massed infantry formations.

 ynnsmen_19_chargestoppersDESCR: "The Chippengarders' meritocratic and militaristic society based around their half-Orcish heritage was uniquely advantageous in the unstable Epednan Expanse. The Chippengarders could field not only the most disciplined and strongest soldiers but also worthy experienced officers to lead them; this relationship fostered mutual trust and an environment of well-placed obedience. One such example was demonstrated in the 1674 battle of Stenurynn, where Chippengarder soldiers allegedly repelled a Sardan heavy cavalry charge barehanded. The unlikely victory earned the Chippengarder soldiers the title of "Chargestoppers" for their immense bravery and military prowess."
 ynnsmen_19_frontier_patrols: "Frontier Patrols"
 ynnsmen_19_frontier_patrolsDESCR: "As Ynnsman administrations began to exert more influence over their territory and resources than before, the emerging threat of organised filibustering and expeditions forced many states to establish quick-response militias to ward off foreign enemies. Known as "frontiersfolk" in Common, many of these local units were contracted by the state to periodically patrol their countryside and, if necessary, repel potential invaders as the first line of defence. Such work was seen as dull and uneventful, to the point where the idiom "yearning for more Ashen Skies" was born, as frontiersfolk sought any action while shambling through the Ynnic landscape."

 ynnsmen_23_havoric_lineDESCR: "The Ivory Wars resulted in the seething New Havoric army routing from the Veykodan lands of Osindain. Frustrated at these humiliating defeats by Ynnic intervention, New Havoric military planners would reorganise their unprofessional rabble of militias, gangs, and paramilitaries into a cohesive conglomerate of registered regiments that would dutifully serve their authoritative majesty. Furthermore, their tactics rapidly adjusted to modern Ynnic warfare, emphasising swift and brutal barrages by massed infantry before unleashing an aggressive charge upon their enemies. Unwilling to be snubbed again by the Veykodans, the New Havoric army consumed the Overlands with fire and steel, ravaging its inhabitants in pursuit of ivory and furs."

 ynnsmen_23_horizon_marchersDESCR: "As firepower intensified and cavalry continued to assert itself in the battles held in the Expanse countryside, Ynnsman military thinkers would urge their rulers to improve the flexibility of their militaries at the tactical level. As a result, Ynnsman tactics would continue to favour smaller infantry companies, these changes focused on maximising the infantry's mobility and reactiveness over weight of numbers while on the open Ynnic battlefield. As a result, they could outmanoeuvre the enemy and unleash effectively-placed salvos of gunfire to quickly shatter their ranks and repel cavalry with assistance from other light companies."

Firearms development allowed for improved reloading technique and reduced their recoil through the wonders of Techno-Thaumaturgy, which enabled rangers to comfortably fire and reload on horseback without needing to dismount. Combined with the loose caracole flanking manoeuvres, the modern Ynnsman skirmisher posed a significant detriment to marching massed armies, who struggled to respond to their swiftness and accuracy. These modern rangers left a lasting legacy that influenced both military and popular culture throughout the Age of Artificery and beyond."

 ynnsmen_26_grenadier_vanguardDESCR: "The power of artificery and alchemy was catastrophic when applied on the battlefield. One such example was the artifice-grenade, ceramic bombs which were enhanced by magic to amplify its explosive power. With such devastating weapons being relatively cost-effective for its immense power, it was selectively adopted amongst Ynnsman states in the forested regions of the Veykodan Overlands. By training specialised shock troops to optimise their effective range in the safety of forest cover, these grenades could devastate infantry and fortifications. These grenades were loathed by the Veykodans for their excessive brutality when deployed en masse in cruel anti-rebellion campaigns by their Ynnsmen overlords."
 ynnsmen_26_plainsmen: "Plainsmen"
 ynnsmen_26_plainsmenDESCR: "In the Expanse, warfare became more dynamic and fast-paced in the lush grasslands, forcing Ynnsmen to reimagine national defence, which traditionally relied upon regional militias and garrisons to muster concentrated counterattacks. Some militaries adopted a more indirect type of warfare by using the vastness of their environment to their advantage. By decentralising forces, some Ynnsman countries focused upon attacking the logistics and movements of enemy forces by launching sporadic, but concentrated, guerilla assaults upon invaders. Often dressed in green tunics or even civilian clothing, these unassuming soldiers could wreak havoc through a shocking fusillade before terrorising straggling marchers, crippling enemy operations."

The Red Sentries were the representation of the quintessential Corinsfielder, best demonstrated by their leader, Captain Ichabod Roose. He was superstitious, traditionalist, and earnestly diligent to ensure the Red Sentries were utterly victorious. Exceptionally disciplined, fanatic, and heavily armoured to endure punishment from Ynnic enchanted bows, these modern crusaders successfully intervened in Fadheyvch, resulting in the annexation of one-third of Sarda's territory and the humiliation of Arverynn. However, the Red Year campaign also resulted in the burning of Adbrabohvi, dooming independent Sarda to political and religious upheaval."

This led General Erin S. Roarsfield to propose a rapid modernization of their army to eclipse their neighbouring rivals and overpower them before they could even the playing field. Rifled muskets, dragoncoat armour, and light artillery were swifty integrated into Plumsteader light companies, providing them unprecedented firepower and durability which proved decisive when the republic would invade Beggaston and seize Selocshana from Sarda during the Red Year crisis."

Horses were selectively bred for speed and power, using modern magical wonders to push these mounts to their fullest potential. These horses would greatly serve Ynnsman rangers, who took advantage of their greater speed to swiftly infiltrate and wreak havoc upon enemy lines using modern artifice-powered firearms. The whistling of windguns, the crackling of magi-revolvers, and the screaming of routing soldiers filled the air, when rangers could now move as fast as the wind, and strike viciously like a hurricane."

Domestic innovations in infantry weapons ranging from homing bullets to magic-action loading by manufacturers such as Buck's Firearms competed with evolving Ynnic maginnovation in an open arms race, giving rise to small unit tactics that exalted squad manoeuvrability, mobility, and infantry skills. Surpassing Roarfield's tactics, the modern Ynnsman infantry would flex their mettle as the Western-Lands Coalition by bravely fighting against High Havoral and Plumstead. This led to many soldiers becoming not just heroes, but legends for their military feats on the battlefield."

It was an army that had state-of-the-art Sparkdrive Rifles juxtaposed with shoddy pipeguns when the troops triumphantly paraded through Drantnik District, establishing decades of a new order of Ynnsman dominance. It was an army that simultaneously had bandits justly enforcing law and order while veteran professionals decadently partied, dizzy-drunk from countless victories. Despite such madness, the Havoric army was the mightiest amongst the Ynnsmen, one that could boast it was the true sovereign over Sarda and Veykoda when they withstood and repelled a united Ynnic resistance throughout the War of the Three River-Banks."

While their jungle home is host to an endless onslaught of dangers, these ritual hunts ensure they are prepared to face them. Those that survive the trials, return as more savage beast than elf, completely changed by their months of isolation within the jungle's grasp. Even without the great strength of the Lai'i, or the deceitful cunning of the Effe'i, the Blood Hunters of the Thavo'i represent the greatest military force within the Effelai. Particularly ambitious unblooded have attempted to partake in the Paruran's cullings of the Leechfather's deformed servants.

Each member of the confederation demonstrates different qualities, each vastly different, but all traits that make for great warriors. The Thavo'i and Lai'i are both great trackers, and incredibly skilled hunters, with the latter also exhibiting unmatched might; while the Parura are formidable hunters, they are also peerless warriors from their endless savage conflicts with the hordes of vile creatures residing within the Leechdens. Even the Effe'i, while not known for their martial prowess, have concocted powerful toxins that are capable of debilitating even the largest of prey. They have also mastered techniques for entrapping any foe foolish enough to pursue them into the treacherous foliage of the Effelai, enabling them to survive for centuries while only rarely needing to lift a spear. While they are often seen as foolhardy in the eyes of the other tribes, the Soruinics have a fiery passion for proving their mettle. While some call their boldness naivete, whether it's fighting horrors alongside the Paruran warriors, or handling deathbloom with the Effe'i; they have proven themselves capable of backing up their haughty ambitions."

Tozyu the Awakener of Winds managed to successfully secure a nest of Dragonnel eggs, a type of large four legged winged lizard-beast in a semblance of form to the dragons depicted in False Enlightened artwork. Tozyu managed to hand raise the creatures, eventually going as far as being able to breed them for domesticality and tameness. By Tozyu’s later years, he eventually split off from his clan, founding the Breaking Wind Conclave which would spread the art of Dragonnel taming and domestication to the rest of Hobgoblin kind over the next three centuries, serving as a terrifying strike force to the clans able to amass large numbers of Dragonnel mounts."

Each is, ultimately, a single mage and thus relies upon a band of sworn warriors and lesser adepts to organize the rank and file, ensuring each warrior knows his or her place in the battle line in order to combat the many threats found across Nomsyulhan. Relying on swift and brutal magics to shatter the enemy’s resolve in mere moments, the initial mage-dueling between the leaders of rival warbands ends up as a quick and violent display of frightening magics as each side attempts to overwhelm the other with pure magical might in what may last hours as opposing sides prove the depth of their magical reserves by outlasting their opponent, aiding their forces in a strategic rather than tactical fashion."

These beasts were larger, stockier, and some even bred for more "draconic" features, as if to replicate the beasts depicted in the artworks of the False Enlightened of old. What the result was varied from clan to clan, though overall led to a more deadly breed that could support a more heavily armoured rider, and a moderate amount of light armour for the Dragonnels' more vulnerable underside to protect it from archer fire or light magical attacks.

This creation allowed a slew of new possibilities for defeating one’s enemies without expending their own magic, and saw the adoption of bladed arquebuses shortly after for non-mage soldiers in order to imitate and compete against rivals."

Seeking to placate such an terrifying spirit, many magi and thus their clans swore fealty to the awakening spirit, and in 1753 when the Rending of Realms began in full, many Eagles welcomed the mighty Kharunyana into an underwater palace crafted solely for him, protected by a legion of sworn wardens."

By 1784 these tensions reached their peak, erupting in the Rebellion of Shattered Talons. The rebellion lasted a total of sixteen days, as several pact-mages sworn to Kharunyana had been gifted the ability of foresight, or had their natural divination skills enhanced by the Great Spirit.

Elite hobgoblin battlemagi of the period were equipped with False Enlightened artifacts and contracted to innumerable minor spirits in order to truly master the laws of the world.

These “Landstrider Irregulars” would act as part mountaineer and part shock infantry, crossing difficult terrain with greater ease than their smaller hobgoblin enemies, striking at supply lines in order to cripple hobgoblin warbands before they could even strike. Magic cannot replace food, after all."

 soulseeker_ogre_26_chi_fueled_armamentsDESCR:0 "With growing knowledge of both Elder People magics and the desperation of being caught between growing Yansheni interest in the lands beyond the passes in eastern Nomsyulhan, the Soulseeker clans were forced to adopt new innovations, primarily inspired by Gommo pieces that had been traded on by the Relic Guilds in Bazuneizar. This led to increased hybridization of ogre’s traditional Giant Runecraft and burgeoning spirit-powered technology. Examples include soldiers bonding with a wind spirit whilst carving miniature shrines into their cannon-sized firearms to channel the spirit’s magic in boosting accuracy and travel range, or “travel shrines” hosting a spirit that would create a magical field preventing fired ammunition from entering or leaving as a form of mobile defensive position."
 soulseeker_ogre_28_overlord_constructs:0 "Overlord Constructs"
 soulseeker_ogre_28_overlord_constructsDESCR:0 "By integrating artifice-powered machinations into their strongest and most venerable Ironwraiths, the Soulseekers were able to create true gods of destruction. Armed with anything from massively upscaled conventional weaponry to salvaged reality-warping weapons of Precursor make, the Overlord Constructs rivaled the True Giants of old in stature and might. On the battlefield, they were simply directed to carve a swathe through the enemy army while conventional forces were left to pick off the rare few who weren’t dead or fleeing for their lives."
 soulseeker_ogre_30_transcendent_zealots:0 "Ghorak'n Oathsworn"
 soulseeker_ogre_30_transcendent_zealotsDESCR:0 "The Rending of Realms saw the need for trained spirit hunters by many states, as the land itself buckled under the weight of the tide. Thus, the remaining Soulseeker Clans in the eastern expanse saw opportunity where there was none before. Soulseeker monks left in droves, selling service to stupefied Halessi who were only familiar with the Oni and their dark magics. Called “Ghorak’n”; a corruption of “ogre kin” as many did not at first believe the Soulseekers to be related in any way to the Oni. Depending on the nature of the spirits needing dealt with, these ogres would either pacify, bind, or destroy the spirit. These monks however also doubled as spies and would regularly bring new knowledge, ideas, and techniques upon their return, now experienced warriors who would be able to implement these ideas in defense of their clans."
