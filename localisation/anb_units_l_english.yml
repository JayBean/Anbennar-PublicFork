 cannorian_1_medieval_infantryDESCR:0 "The basic soldier of Cannorian armies. They tended to be peasant levies with little or no training and very poor equipment. However when deployed en masse they could be devastating.."
 cannorian_1_medieval_knights:0 "Medieval Knights"
 cannorian_1_medieval_knightsDESCR:0 "The medieval Knight originated with the Castanorian hero Caylen Longlance's reforms, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread through Cannor and became an integral part of the feudal system, in which knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."
 cannorian_5_longbow:0 "Damerian Longbowmen"
 cannorian_5_longbowDESCR:0 "Despite the elven stereotype of being master-archers, it was actually their long-term allies, the Damerians, that taught them the art of the bow. Up until the end of the Lilac Wars, the longbow was the Damerian weapon-of-choice, and were the bane of many a Lorentish knight."
 cannorian_5_men_at_arms:0 "Men-at-Arms"
 cannorian_5_men_at_armsDESCR:0 "The Man-at-Arms was a professional soldier in Cannorian armies of the late middle ages. Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier, often bearing steel from the many foundries and workshops that rose during the time, such as the dwarves of Silverforge and the Vanburies of Telgeir. During the Lilac Wars, Men-at-Arms were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights. The better equipped and better trained were known as Sergeants-at-Arms."
 cannorian_9_adventurer_band:0 "Adventurer Bands"
 cannorian_9_adventurer_bandDESCR:0 "Adventurers have been both a boon and a bane across Cannor for years. Often troublesome, but also offering a wide breadth of experience and insight beyond the common soldier - by integrating adventurers within our armies it allows us to cover a wide breadth of situations and draw upon their expertise."
 cannorian_9_pike_and_shot:0 "Pike & Shot"
 cannorian_9_pike_and_shotDESCR:0 "It is said that the Pike & Shot helped win the Greentide - and that the thunderous roar of gunfire caused even the bravest of orcish hordes to hesitate. Earlier variants had heavily armoured pikemen and halberdiers supported by embedded arquebusiers in order to both strike fear and gun down orcs and be able to face them in close combat. After the Greentide the armoured pikemen portion slowly fell out of favour to lighter cuirasses or no heavy armour at all."
 cannorian_10_gun_knights:0 "Gun Knights"
 cannorian_10_gun_knightsDESCR:0 "With the advent of smaller firearms by gnomish inventors, knights and other heavy cavalrymen often carried several pistols with them in battle to discharge at close range during their charges."
 cannorian_12_thorn_formation:0 "Thorn Formation"
 cannorian_12_thorn_formationDESCR:0 "The Thorn Formation was a mixed infantry formation of pikemen and musketeers. Because of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed both the rigidity of its heavy infantry and the long-range firepower of its musketeers, making it an ideal defensive and offensive formation. Originally developed by the Lorentish general Darien síl Ainethán during its Wars of Dominion against Gawed it proved that a smaller, defensive and elite Lorentish force could defeat the larger mass of Gawedi infantry (who at that time were still primarily using melee weapons)."
 cannorian_14_outriders:0 "Outriders"
 cannorian_14_outridersDESCR:0 "As guns became more easily mass-produced the role of the knight in mounted combat diminished. No longer did cavalry need specialized training, money or noble-birth, but instead simply be able to charge, swing and shoot."
 cannorian_15_volley_infantry:0 "Volley Infantry"
 cannorian_15_volley_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Halfling War of Independence the halfling armies were outmatched by the pike/musket combination of the Lorentish Thorn Formations. As halflings could not wield pikes due to their stature, they developed a new tactic relying on mass fire with lines twelve, six or eight musketeers deep. When the first ranked line fired, they would run move to the rear and the second line would fire. Due to the availability of muskets and more importantly, the large populations of halflings, this system negated the long reload relating to muskets, and stood well against the more defensive and stationary Thorn Formation."
 cannorian_18_reformed_outriders:0 "Reformed Outriders"
 cannorian_18_reformed_outridersDESCR:0 "The advent of more reliable and accurate guns reformed the army as a whole, moving to a lighter armoured infantry core that wielded rifles as their primary weapon. In return heavy armour was no longer prized in battle, as the usual bullet could penetrate it, and outriders soon abandoned heavier plate to just a simple breastplate."
 cannorian_19_thorn_formation2:0 "Ashen Thorn Formation"
 cannorian_19_thorn_formation2DESCR:0 "Over time bullets became deadlier and armour became more and more obsolete. As armies changed to lighter cavalry and less-armoured infantry, the famous Thorn Formation replaced a large majority of their pikemen with more musketeers, hence the 'ash'."
 cannorian_23_dragoons:0 "Escanni Dragoons"
 cannorian_23_dragoonsDESCR:0 "In 17th century Escann, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon (named after the core sigil of Escann). Dragoons were widely used by all Cannorian nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 cannorian_23_line_infantry:0 "Line Infantry"
 cannorian_23_line_infantryDESCR:0 "Line infantry tactics tried to find a balance between attack and defense and did not specialize in either. However, these infantry were stronger in fire and shock. Their aim would be to use the musket volleys to disorganize the enemy before they could charge, in particular if they were primarily a shock action force."
 cannorian_26_carabiners:0 "Carabiners"
 cannorian_26_carabinersDESCR:0 "The Carabiners first came into being in the 16th century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armor, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between them was their armament. Carabiners main weapon was the carabine, sometimes also called the arquebus, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carabine, they were also armed with pistols and a sword."
 cannorian_26_rosecoat_infantry:0 "Rosecoat Infantry"

 cannorian_26_dovecoat_infantry:0 "Dovecoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_dovecoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Due to the high population of Anbennar, Dovecoat infantry focused on simply taking volleys and overwhelming the enemy with numbers."
 cannorian_26_dragoncoat_infantry:0 "Dragoncoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_dragoncoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Dragoncoat infantry rely on being able to take damage and deal it back tenfold, similar to how a dragon's scale can withstand damage and a dragon's breathe can cause it."
 cannorian_28_impulse_infantry:0 "Impulse Infantry"
 cannorian_28_impulse_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Wars of the Northern League, the main Gawedi army was outmatched and faltering. To make up for this, irregular units from the frontier, such as hunters from the Greatwoods, were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed Gawedi armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the Cannorian battlefield. The most extreme solution was the impulse warfare unit. These units put forward a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."
 cannorian_28_cuirassier:0 "Cuirassier"
 cannorian_28_cuirassierDESCR:0 "The Cuirassier takes its name from the Cuirass, a breast plate worn by the heaviest cavalry units. Wielding a heavy sword rather than a light saber, these units are fearsome when they charge. Usually supported by units of carbine equipped cavalry to give them extra punch, these units add shock power to any army."
 cannorian_30_drill_infantry:0 "Ancardian Drill Infantry"
 cannorian_30_drill_infantryDESCR:0 "The Ancardian Reforms revolutionized early modern warfare, instilling the reliance of simple yet effective drills to not only maximize firepower output but a reinforced and near-unbreakable line."
 cannorian_30_sparkdrive_irregulars:0 "Sparkdrive Irregulars"
 cannorian_30_sparkdrive_irregularsDESCR:0 "The Sparkdrive Rifle was a strange gnomish invention that was said to contain an essence of a lightning elemental, operated by a rotating lever that charged the rifle and shot a burst of concentrated lightning. Eventually these Sparkdrive companies, also known as 'Cranker Companies' after the sound of the lever, were a prized part of warfare, often used to snipe enemy commanders in the battlefield, and even targetting armies as they camped."

 dwarven_1_shieldwall:0 "Shieldwalls"
 dwarven_1_shieldwallDESCR:0 "An ancient military tactic, the shieldwall was no doubt done best by its creators, the dwarves. A line of armorclad warriors holding iron-plated tower shields separated by thin gaps to let pikes through, this strategy has proven an effective defensive formation time and time again, ensuring both the safety of dwarven men and the slow demise of the enemy."
 dwarven_5_massed_clockwork_bows:0 "Massed Clockwork Bows"
 dwarven_5_massed_clockwork_bowsDESCR:0 "The fall of Aul-Dwarov saw much knowledge lost to the ages, but a few remnants of military ingenuity remain. The primary example of this was the Clockwork Bow, an alloyed composite bow capable of exerting pressure on its own coiled steel bowstring. The additional tension helps to launch bolts at unfathomable speeds, making quick work of hostile warbands when launched in concentrated volleys. Expense and tradition would make such items much more expensive than contemporary crossbows, and eventually would be phased out by firearms."
 dwarven_5_tortoise_formation:0 "Tortoise Formation"
 dwarven_5_tortoise_formationDESCR:0 "The life of a single dwarf is worth far more than the death of a single goblin, and thus dwarven military doctrine tended to prioritize self-preservation above all else. This concept was realized in the classic Tortoise Formation, a mix between the classic shieldwall and the one-sided phalanx. Though ultimately situational, its ability to defend from missiles and footmen alike made it a mainstay of adventurer bands in the Dwarovar during the early stages of the Reclamation."
 dwarven_9_pepper_and_tortoise:0 "Pepper and Tortoise"
 dwarven_9_pepper_and_tortoiseDESCR:0 "Though good at keeping dwarven soldiers alive, the classical Tortoise Formation lacked any semblance of maneuverability or offensive capability. With recent advancements in clockwork and gunpowder weaponry, this weakness was quickly rectified, stationing ranged ‘Pepperers’ in the middle of the tortoise shell with small openings for projectiles to pass through. This method allowed the formation to maintain its rigid defense whilst maintaining some semblance of pressure on the enemy."
 dwarven_9_remnant_harquebusiers:0 "Remnant Harquebusiers"
 dwarven_9_remnant_harquebusiersDESCR:0 "One of the many technologies salvaged from the fall of Aul-Dwarov, the methods regarding the construction and upkeep of firearms were largely lost, leaving survivors with remarkably few instances of true arquebi. This all changed with the eventual progression of smithing precision and production utilities, eventually culminating in the first widespread recreation of ancient dwarven firearms: the dwarven harquebus. Though ultimately less effective than the Cannorian arquebus that, within a few decades, would dominate Cannorian warfare, it was an important stepping stone in the pursuit of lost knowledge, and especially the pursuit of even deadlier weapons."
 dwarven_12_clockwork_riflemen:0 "Clockwork Riflemen"
 dwarven_12_clockwork_riflemenDESCR:0 "Many of the shortcomings present in the harquebus were soon addressed by adapting the clockwork mechanics of dwarven bows and crossbows into the loading and priming mechanisms of modern firearms. The results were vastly improved firing speeds, and despite the relative weakness of each projectile, the sheer quantity of bullets was enough to drown out any potential critics of the unreliable weapons."
 dwarven_12_runic_greataxes:0 "Runic Greataxes"
 dwarven_12_runic_greataxesDESCR:0 "Despite runesmithing’s decline outside of the Dwarovar, inside the vast mountain range the practice was very much alive. Runes of durability were engraved upon the pommels of mithril-etched greataxes, wielded by elite warriors in enchanted armor to serve as the vanguard of a hold’s grand army. Few of the dwarves’ machinations managed to inspire fear into the remnants of Korgus’ empire as well as the sheer power of these weapons of unending death."
 dwarven_15_fire_and_tortoise:0 "Fire and Tortoise"
 dwarven_15_fire_and_tortoiseDESCR:0 "Violently clinging to life, the ancient Tortoise Formation experienced a notable resurgence at the dawn of the 17th century with its unique ability to prove an immovable obstacle on the battlefield. Replacing the iron shields of old with dwarven steel made for effective bulletproof mobile fortifications, allowing the short-statured gunmen to take up superior positions and rain hell upon the fiends that dared to stand in their sights."
 dwarven_15_scattergun_auxiliaries:0 "Scattergun Auxiliaries"
 dwarven_15_scattergun_auxiliariesDESCR:0 "As the rest of the world managed to grasp the foundations of blackpowder warfare, the dwarves were already adapting these rudimentary tactics into the field of unconventional warfare. Harquebus-fire lacked the versatility to deal with stagnant lines or study fortifications, and thus from the cradle of necessity, the scattergun was brought into the world. Firing a close spread of pellets as opposites to a single ball, the scattergun managed to maintain relevance in both long-range skirmishes and close-range engagements. Despite its apparent effectiveness, its lack of durability and the inability of runesmiths to rectify this issue ultimately doomed it to early retirement."
 dwarven_19_rotary_vanguards:0 "Rotary Vanguards"
 dwarven_19_rotary_vanguardsDESCR:0 "New and improved rotary guns utilize existing clockwork technology to spin a four-barrel tube, ejecting high-velocity ordinance at an unprecedented rate. Its lack of accuracy and inability to move during use were major flaws, but its raw destructive power oft compensated for its tactical shortcomings. By placing these devastating weapons at the head of the vanguard, dwarven armies were able to substantially soften up enemies before the main force engaged."
 dwarven_19_skullcrusher_brigades:0 "Skullcrusher Brigades"
 dwarven_19_skullcrusher_brigadesDESCR:0 "The ever-present traditionalist movements present in dwarven society had great impact even in the army, with many dwarves choosing to adapt the fierce tactics employed by the adventurer bands of old into modern formations in an attempt to relive the glory of the Reclamation. Though these attempts typically ended in disaster, the Skullcrusher Brigades were a notable exception. Comprised of veteran adventurers and expeditionaries, these units employed an odd mix of warriors, rangers, and mages to wreak havoc upon enemy lines in a horrific cacophony of bloodshed and terror."
 dwarven_23_grudgesettlers:0 "The Grudgesettlers"
 dwarven_23_grudgesettlersDESCR:0 "A new generation of adventurers means a new generation of veterans–and new faces to fight for the same grudges of old. As the Skullcrusher Brigades began to retire, the unsettled grudges of the last remnants of the Reclamation spurred new blood to form independent units of mercenary-adventurers, continuing the Skullcrushers’ role in the battlefield wielding firearms laced with an incendiary agent. It is said that as the corpses of our enemies smolder, retribution for past transgressions grows ever-closer to being fully paid."
 dwarven_23_steelcoat_infantry:0 "Steelcoat Infantry"
 dwarven_23_steelcoat_infantryDESCR:0 "The Cannorians truly lack a sense of naming. They boast so-called ‘Dovecoat Infantry’, despite the pigeons possessing no viciousness nor strength on their own. The resolve of a dwarf cannot be relegated to a mere bird. With skin made of iron and steel in our bones, we have devised a far more fitting, and far more literal, moniker. Dwarven Steelcoat Infantrymen don coats lined with thin, lightweight sheets of steel to provide additional defense against the pesky pellets that other races are so fond of flinging."
 dwarven_26_hotshot_rotary_gunners:0 "Hotshot Rotary Gunners"
 dwarven_26_hotshot_rotary_gunnersDESCR:0 "Rudimentary gun placements modified to accept incendiary ammunition, these upgraded rotary guns address many of the issues prevalent in previous designs. Primarily, the lack of maneuverability had been fixed by reducing the caliber the weapon uses, with bullets each engraved with a flame rune to substitute for the overall loss in firepower."
 dwarven_26_splintered_tortoise_formation:0 "Splintered Tortoise Formation"
 dwarven_26_splintered_tortoise_formationDESCR:0 "The final iteration before its eventual extinction, the famed Tortoise Formation found new life with the propagation of stationary rotary guns in the modern battlefield. The minor improvements in mobility allowed the guns to move alongside the slothful tortoise shell, with specialized shielding placed at the front of the guns as both protection and for gunners to camouflage into the immutable formation."
 dwarven_28_forgefire_repeaters:0 "Forgefire Repeaters"
 dwarven_28_forgefire_repeatersDESCR:0 "The resurgence of clockwork mechanisms in the late 18th century gave rise to a number of clockwork assault rifles, the most famous of which was the Forgefire Repeater. The name itself was an exonym given to standard clockwork rifles paired with rune-enhanced incendiary rounds, though it was ultimately a fitting one, for these weapons truly put whomever was unfortunate enough to be caught in their fire through a crucible akin to a forge, with the only survivors being those able to withstand the heat and be tempered by the experience."
 dwarven_28_matchbeard_mortars:0 "Matchbeard Mortars"
 dwarven_28_matchbeard_mortarsDESCR:0 "Originally reserved for the backlines, mortars began to see increased use in the front lines of dwarven armies with shorter fuses and lighter frames compensating for their general unwieldiness. The operators of these new mortars were known as Matchbeards, mainly due to their odd appearances: embroidered beards with matches woven between each braid, so that regardless of the situation, a fuse could be lit."
 dwarven_30_gemstone_beamsplitters:0 "Gemstone Beamsplitters"
 dwarven_30_gemstone_beamsplittersDESCR:0 "A glorious symphony of rune magic and artificery, the dwarven beamsplitters represent the peak of dwarven magical weaponry. A damestear core designed to supply a number of mithril conductors with raw magical energy to pass a powerful beam of pure magic through an intricately-runecrafted gemstone. The beam’s quality’s could be changed by swapping the type of gemstone, or by modifying the facets to alter the beam’s angle, power, or elemental resonance. Though lacking in pure power, its versatility is ultimately what made these mechanisms dominate the battlefield in the early 19th century."
 dwarven_30_mithrilcoat_infantry:0 "Mithrilcoat Infantry"
 dwarven_30_mithrilcoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Donning their metal coats once more, the legendary Steelcoats of old enjoyed a comfortable, lightweight upgrade in the form of mithril coats capable of deflecting both blade and bullet, with particular resistance to black damestear. It was Mithrilcoats that ultimately constituted the bulk of dwarven armies during the early 19th century, with their white coats quickly becoming a feared sight for all."

 dwarven_6_ram_riders:0 "Ram Riders"
 dwarven_6_ram_ridersDESCR:0 "Cavalry has never been a core contingent of dwarven armies due to their short stature and defensive orientation. In cases where an enemy army refuses to be broken the dwarven offensive is led by a shattering charge of warbred rams, often guaranteeing an enemy rout."
 dwarven_10_ramsteel_chargers:0 "Ramsteel Chargers"
 dwarven_10_ramsteel_chargersDESCR:0 "The reclamation of Orlazam-az-dihr and surrounding lands has brought forth the propagation of Ramsteel, an ancient metal thought to be lost to the Final Days. Its incredible strength combined with relatively light weight makes it the ideal metal to outfit ram rider regiments with. Though cavalry still made up an insignificant portion of most dwarven armies, it was this rediscovery that would maintain the ram’s role into the future."
 dwarven_14_caverntrot_outriders:0 "Caverntrot Outriders"
 dwarven_14_caverntrot_outridersDESCR:0 "Cavalry’s inability to effectively flank the enemy in tight caverns often forced combatants to exclude its use from battles. Such poor resource management was unbefitting of the dwarves, who would eventually, through a combination of selective breeding and refitted hooves, reintroduce the ram to cavern combat as an effective mainstay."
 dwarven_18_clockwork_ram_rangers:0 "Clockwork Ram Rangers"
 dwarven_18_clockwork_ram_rangersDESCR:0 "The resurgence of clockwork weaponry following the Reclamation gave rise to many odd contraptions and weapons, though none saw as much use as the Clockwork Rifle. The convenience of the loading and firing mechanisms combined with its relative light weight made these weapons a favorite of the dwarven ram riders, allowing the riders to maintain continuous fire even whilst handling a burly ram."
 dwarven_23_rune_dragoons:0 "Rune Dragoons"
 dwarven_23_rune_dragoonsDESCR:0 "Plated with enchanted ramsteel armor further enhanced with traditional runemagic, the Rune Dragoons were a terrifying sight on the battlefield. Boasting clockwork pistols and rune-enhanced steeds, the dragoons could swiftly enter combat with their repeating weaponry, cause as much havoc as possible, then leave to make way for the bulk of the frontline."
 dwarven_28_mecharams:0 "Mecha-Ram Cavalry"
 dwarven_28_mecharamsDESCR:0 "Rapid advancements in artificery and rune magic have given rise to the Mecha-Ram, a fully mechanical replacement for the rams typically seen carrying dwarven riders. These steel beasts do not flinch in the heat of battle, and with the ergonomics of the mount fully configurable, small stature was no longer a hindrance to potential cavalrymen. Overwhelming firepower may inspire fear in the enemy, but only the mecha-ram can truly bring the fight beyond the frontlines and run down a rout."

 emerald_orc_23_druidic_warriorsDESCR:0 "Ever since that first forest encounter, we have drawn power from the Fey, but now many among us are veritable druids, who can draw upon the Feyrealm’s magic to their own ends. Because of the generally ritualistic nature of their magic, it is preferable that we do not risk losing them in battle in the front of our armies, as they are far more useful providing support from behind. When it comes down to it, however, all of these druids are warriors in their own right, and will employ their magic alongside their blades in combat."
 emerald_orc_26_archfey_warlocks:0 "Archfey Warlocks"
 emerald_orc_26_archfey_warlocksDESCR:0 "As we have become more deeply fey, we have moved beyond the need for druidic rituals, with many among us granted magic directly from the Feyrealm.

 eordand_1_ruin_garrisonDESCR:0 "With the constant wars that have plagued Eordand since the failure of Pelomar to reassert the fey’s authority, fortifications around Precursor ruins have become an integral part of the landscape. The armies of the different states are typically formed out of soldiers who spend most of their time defending these fortifications, only leaving during wartime.

The Nadimraj's old semi-professional soldiers fell out of favor with the ascension of the harimari consolidating military service among the tigerfolk, but the growing strength of human Raheni kingdoms and the threat of the hobgoblins would see the practice reinstituted during the late 1300s and come into full bloom by the 1460s."

These conditions attracted many fine military minds, including those fleeing chaos in the north, and saw a blossoming of new tactics among the Slave Legions of the Bhuvauri. Though they had far less combat experience than their northern cousins, the Sarniryasbadi fielded refined, well drilled infantry corps with uniform and modern equipment, troops unhindered by the exhaustion and desperation that plagued the Shamakhadi at this time."

The Rasarhid armies favored a small heavily armored infantry core supported by a large number of archers and early arquebusiers, who served as the true killing power of the army. Devastating volleys of arrows would prompt the enemy to approach strongly defended positions, where they would meet a solid wall of steel and will.. Rasarhid infantry became famous for their rigid stoicism in the face of battle, holding formation even in the face of terrible odds, and though their static formations were inflexible they were among the most difficult forces in Rahen to rout."

Building on their traditions of a well-drilled force, Sarniryasbadi Arquebusiers were combined with strong pike formations and deployed on barges along the Kharunyana to unleash withering fire on approaching enemies. These musket-armed forces would form the backbone of the armies that would fight the hobgoblins to a standstill in the Great Dhujat War. Though they lacked the ferocious charges of the harimari or masterful mounted cavalry of the elves, the Bhuvauri were perhaps the most crucial element of the coalition, creating a wall of pike and shot that matched the discipline of the Hobgoblins and halted the Command in its tracks at the walls of Khiraspid."

With no soil to till, these veteran legionaries flocked to the armies of the Bhuvauri, the Porcelain Cities,  and the western Bom States, forming an elite corps of exiles hell-bent on reclaiming their homes."

With months of dedicated practice each year, Raheni farmers became surprisingly accurate with firearms, and a valuable resource that could swell the ranks of Raheni armies to huge numbers of capable infantry, rapidly trained in soldiering by the professionals alongside whom they had practiced."

When the first missionaries arrived, there was tension, and often violence, but from these elves a truth was soon revealed. Learning from the strong is not a weakness. It is a necessity. With our own soldiers humbled so thoroughly, all that remained was the drive to adapt. Adapt our guns, adapt our lines, adapt the heads of dwarves into the ground.

Generals would lead their armies into the pikewalls, deceived by such a simple misdirection, while the wise would send skirmishers to challenge the pikemen, only for them to be scorched by belching flames from the pikemen at close range before being slaughtered.

Pressed into slave battalions, these soldiers would be simply drilled to operate “imported” (scavenged, stolen, salvaged) firearms before being integrated into battle-ready packs for future raids.

In a bastardization of modern Jaddarin drill, gnolls would form into “boomstick lines” and fire an unholy salvo of shrapnel and fire before charging into the fray of the weakened opponents’ formations.

Many of them had an affinity for magic and were capable of imbuing weapons with demonfire, unquenchable and hungry flames summoned from the depths themselves. When firearms were introduced into the Salahad, shamans were encouraged to bless guns with demonic rituals, allowing their shots to be demonfire conductors. Throughout the Age of the Witchkings, powerful gnollish leaders would equip their most loyal and zealous gnolls with demonic blunderbusses and bullet-resistant plate armour which resembled the scales of ancient dragons. These specialised shock troops would be called the Dragonfire Warriors, as their visage and way of war resembled the dragons of yore."

 gnollish_19_early_flamespittersDESCR:0 "Though gnollish society began to lose its savage bloodlust through anti-monstrous reforms, it also gained vast knowledge, technology, and development which flowed through gnollish entrepots. Goblinfire, an esoteric compound from the ports of Aqatbar, was introduced to the gnolls during the Age of the Witchkings through trade with the Overclan. This black concoction would be funnelled into canisters before being ignited by a slow-burning match, then ejected through an air-powered hose, producing a constant stream of hellish fire. Although such contraptions were too heavy to be used in pitched battle in the Salahedesi, gnollish lieutenants would use these flamespitters in an exhibit of power, intimidating enemy garrisons and rebel holdouts with the threat of painful and slow immolation."
 gnollish_23_blunderbuss_chargers:0 "Blunderbuss Chargers"
 gnollish_23_blunderbuss_chargersDESCR:0 "The main issue presented by the inaccurate gnollish blunderbuss was not its inability to hit targets from a distance, but rather how best to get gnollish soldiers as close to the enemy as humanly possible without jeopardizing the formation. The solution was simple: small contingents of gnolls would charge the enemy with blunderbuss in hand, whilst supported by covering fire from the rear."
 gnollish_23_fleshroast_brigades:0 "Fleshroast Brigades"
 gnollish_23_fleshroast_brigadesDESCR:0 "For centuries, gnolls had been developing myriads of gunpowder weapons, seeking to outdo other rival gnolls in martial power and clan prestige. Though many of these creations would manifest through countless mutilated variations of muskets and pistols, some of them returned to form by looking towards the grenade for wisdom. Iron-cast grenades, blessed by the shamans, became the iconic weapon of the Fleshroast Brigades for their devastating power against any material. Projected with specially-crafted staff slings, these grenades could fly hundreds of feet in the air before exploding under the feet of the enemy, butchering and roasting their flesh alive or above their heads, showering them with shrapnel and demonic fireballs. The Fleshroast Brigades would become infamous in the eastern Salahad, as their grenades could hunt and roast any living flesh, from Jaddarin cavalry to harpy skirmishers."

 gnollish_23_scattershot_faceblastersDESCR:0 "It is no surprise that gnolls love entering the fray of battle at any opportunity, regardless if they are a cultured merchant or the most barbaric warrior. As such, gnollish firearms were often designed for either hunting or guaranteeing that close-quarters-combat would happen, allowing for warriors to immerse themselves in the carnage and bloodshed. One such wretched invention was the volley-gun, a multi barreled flintlock musket which would fire a volley’s worth of shots simultaneously, tearing any unfortunate souls apart at close range. Volley-guns would be most renowned in the hands of the Faceblasters, a gnollish mercenary group who were capable of concealing themselves in the sandy dunes for days until suitable prey marched across cluelessly, pulverising the enemy’s faces at point-blank."

 gnollish_26_beastshot_repeatersDESCR:0 "Though the gnolls had no foreign allies due to their warlike behaviour, they had many connections into the black market underworld, some of which would sell well-crafted weapons in exchange for a hefty fee. One such client was the Citrine Dwarves of Seghdihr, who would smuggle hundreds of repeater rifles to Jaddarin gnollish contingents. Admired for their high rate of fire and accurate lethality, gnollish artificers would replicate their design; although these copies would lack the exquisite Dwarven craftsmanship and detail. Such repeaters would be the primary weapon for gnollish dragoons, who could quickly manoeuvre onto a safe firing position before battering the flanks of enemy formations with an accurate salvo of rifle fire."
 gnollish_26_double_barrel_blunderbuss:0 "Double-Barrel Blunderbusses"
 gnollish_26_double_barrel_blunderbussDESCR:0 "The double-barrel blunderbuss was an unconventional weapon originating in Gnollakaz which rapidly spread throughout the remaining independent gnoll polities. Originally designed to hunt large game and to defend raiding ships from oncoming marines, the blunderbuss became a popular weapon-of-choice for its brutal damage and its ability to fire two independent shots before reloading. Gnolls would use these firearms primarily to easily tear open supply carriages, lightly-armoured infantry, and the doors of unfortunate households before seizing the loot and captives; threatening their prey with the wrath of another devastating barrage loaded in the second barrel."
 gnollish_26_greenflame_launchers:0 "Greenflame Launchers"
 gnollish_26_greenflame_launchersDESCR:0 "As fortifications became more complex and resilient to address the overwhelming strength of artificer-invented artillery, so too the role of sappers and diggers became more pronounced in siege warfare. In gnollish military strategy, sappers were often sent first to establish temporary fieldworks and to identify weak points in the enemy fortress; this strategy often resulted in many gnollish sappers cluelessly stepping into kill-zones, being slaughtered by the defenders in the process. By the dawn of the Age of Artificers, gnollish commanders would start issuing sappers with greenflame launchers, heavy flamethrowers that could launch concentrated fireballs at enemy garrisons. Mounted upon fieldworks or even on sandy dunes, gnollish sappers would be able to threaten defenders with immolation from afar, allowing for the gnolls to hypothetically advance without any opposition to fulfil tactical objectives."

 gnollish_30_combustion_bombersDESCR:0 "Onekxhur (literally “black-fire”) is a concoction widely used by the gnolls. Typically made by extracting tar and distilling it with swamp peat, this thick liquid was often used in shamanistic rituals to unleash long-lasting and fiery blazes for religious purposes. As firearms became more complex, the gnolls would apply onekxhur into their modern weaponry, pouring copious amounts of the hellish concoction into rockets. After being fired at the enemy, the onekxhur would ignite and violently spread throughout the battlefield, ripping at the flesh of enemies as their morale quickly crumpled from such a cruel invention-of-war."
 gnollish_30_two_gauge_trenchguns:0 "2-Gauge Trenchguns"
 gnollish_30_two_gauge_trenchgunsDESCR:0 "The 2-gauge shotgun was one of the most advanced and powerful firearms that gnoll gunsmiths could manufacture by the end of the Age of Artificers; such a hulking, breech-loading behemoth required a crew of two gnolls to carry, operate and fire accurately. In spite of these flaws, the 2-gauge shotgun would be adopted into gnollish military strategy. Gnollish companies would implement pin-and-flank tactics, wherein skirmishers would pin down enemy units with accurate rifle-fire from advantageous terrain to allow the 2-Gauge shotgun crews to flank deep into enemy lines unchecked, firing canister shots to disembowel the pinned enemy units. The skirmishers would then charge forwards, slaughtering the stragglers in melee combat. With these innovations, gnollish commanders could overcome larger armies by constantly applying overwhelming firepower to enemy weak points and eliminating their fragmented forces."

 gnollish_30_xhazxhur_flamespittersDESCR:0 "Although gnollish artificery was traditionally seen as inferior throughout the Age of Artificers, one of their wretched inventions became internationally infamous for its brazen cruelty: the Xhazxhur Flamespitter. Consisting of two canisters filled with greenfire and pressurised air, the flamespitter was operated by squeezing a lever, which would cause the pressurised air to force the greenfire out through a nozzle, spewing a jet of hellish flames up to 15 metres far. Used by heavily-armoured shock troops, these gnollish soldiers could comfortably close the distance against fortified enemies before spraying greenfire upon the enemy, carbonising their unfortunate souls alive in an insatiable blaze."

 gnollish_1_dire_hyenasDESCR:0 "Dire hyenas are the larger biological cousin of the gnoll. With an average weight of 900 lbs and length of 12 feet, these beasts were a dangerous sight to encounter in the Salahad. In ancient times, gnolls successfully tamed these large creatures to serve as den guardians and even war mounts, and those who accomplished the deed were honoured by their pack chieftains, for dire hyenas could easily maul any prey that their tamers desired."

 gnollish_6_armoured_hyena_ridersDESCR:0 "As armour became more commonplace within gnollish armies as a result of extensive looting and decisive victories against foreign enemies, wealthy hyena tamers began to cover their dire hyena mounts with armour plates. Due to the sheer effectiveness of these mounts in gnollish raids due to the added durability, armoured hyenas quickly became associated with the power and wealth of a pack leader, for more armoured hyenas meant more dead men and elves on the battlefield."

 gnollish_10_salahad_suneatersDESCR:0 "The Salahad Suneaters were an elite mercenary group associated with the Gnollakaz pack that prevailed throughout the Age of Unravelling. Although successful against their Kheteratan rivals in raids and skirmishes throughout the borderlands, they were most renowned for their effectiveness against Jaddarin drilled infantry through their accurate mounted greatbow accuracy. Given such a reputation, gnollish mounted archers were given the moniker of Suneaters, whether the pack was the birthplace of the mercenary group or not."

 gnollish_14_dire_packmastersDESCR:0 "Despite the ever-increasing propagation of firearms in warfare, gnolls remained adamant in using their dire hyenas companions for war in the traditional ways of gnollish hunting.  As a result gnollish packmasters would appeal to the pack-hunting nature of their dire hyena companions, expanding their cackles up to several dozen hyenas per packmaster. Provided sufficient conditioning by the tamers, dire hyena packs would swiftly charge towards their victims before ravaging their flesh and bones mercilessly."

The Scav Outriders were established during the middle years of the Age of Witch Kings, consisting of scouts and skirmishers hand-picked by their commanders. They were traditionally deployed far ahead of their compatriots to collect information on enemy movements, harass supply convoys, and seek valuable resources such as water and wild game for the entire pack to subsist on as the warhost kept marching at full speed."
 gnollish_23_savage_dragoons:0 "Savage Dragoons"
 gnollish_23_savage_dragoonsDESCR:0 "The concept of mounted musketry was not a foreign idea to the gnollish people. Since the introduction of the firearm, gnolls combined the speed and endurance of their dire hyena mounts and the lethality of muskets to easily hunt big game for their clans’ sustenance. Likewise, gnollish cavalry often consisted of dragoons armed with long-barreled muskets, dressed in the bones of their latest hunts. These dragoons were capable of skirmishing enemy formations from far range to weaken their numbers and morale, before encircling the remnants and slaughtering them in melee."

 gnollish_28_hyena_shaturnalsDESCR:0 "Despite the emerging dominance of artillery in modern warfare, the Salahad’s soft sand guaranteed that most artillery pieces would sink into the ground, effectively rendering them worthless. The gnolls would adapt to these two guiding realities by developing swivel guns known as shaturnals, which could be mounted upon dire hyenas. En masse, these shaturnals could be as devastating as traditional artillery, while being nearly as mobile as cavalry."

Rilsean Wardens, named after the Sarda word for "Kingdom", were a heterogeneous force of full-time fighters and spellcasters, serving as the middle step between feudal and standing armies. While their choice of weapon varied, they were most commonly outfitted with enchanted spears and shields bearing the coat of arms of their realm, as well as an enchanted mail-and-plate armour."

These Dolindhan hunters have achieved it as well, and they dress in the magically-augmented fur of their slain wendigo to show for it. In battle they fling their massive spears before closing in to fight with battleaxes and greathammers."

 ynnic_26_dismounted_ynnic_knightsDESCR:0 "Despite the nobility and prestige associated with their steed, Ynnic Knights were no strangers to fighting on foot. Before stirrups were adopted, most knights would in fact dismount and fight on foot during prolonged battles, and this role became prominent again during the late Age of Witch-Kings, thanks to the inspiration provided by Malacnar Companions. Dismounted Ynnic Knights or "Nohy Vytrie" were those knights who entered the battle already on foot, and they were most commonly last-born sons or lesser nobility, serving as elite infantry to rally the other troops and provide the mainstay of the Ynnic battle line. Donning full body armour and wielding greatswords, they slowly but surely advanced towards the enemy lines, deflecting enemy bullets from a distance. And once they were close enough to see their enemies eye to eye, they would dash towards them right before they could reload."

Nicknamed "Drozmateers" by Cannorian merchants, these warriors were far scarier than their nickname made them out to be, as was the mass fire coming out of their green, dragonscale-like bladed muskets. In the Rzentur's signature combination of savagery and religious zeal, they formed a tactic that had alternating members of the line fire whilst the others charged at the enemy."

 ynnic_26_forest_eye_manhuntersDESCR:0 "Few Ruinborn know hardship and struggle as well as the Teira, who have lived for centuries in the frigid land of Dalaire under the constant threat of the Cursed Ones. Teira battle style is an extension of their lifestyle: small, secretive bands who scrape by while doing their best not to draw attention, but capable, if cornered, to set lethal ambushes against their would-be hunters. Having arrived to the Ynn thanks to a secret pathway through the Forest of the Cursed Ones known only to them, Teira were outfitted with weapons such as crossbows, spears and throwing daggers of a far higher quality than anything they were used to, but even under the service of Ynnic Lords they still continued wearing the same camouflage-painted fur coats their brethren did in Dalaire. This attire favoured their primary task: irregular warfare, skirmishes, ambushes and supply train disruption, providing a response to the frontiermen's own asymmetrical warfare and developing a fame as hunters of men second only to Wendigos. The sight of the Teira’s glowing eyes staring at you from the woods was enough to send common troops into a panic."

Discipline was enforced, and the previous Drozmateer tactic of charging at will into enemy lines was abolished; Gospodh Aranthiv deemed it "Improper of a modern army". Rather, platoon fire was developed, so that the Dominion's "mouths of fire" could keep "roaring" constantly in all moments of the battle."

 ynnic_30_longbow_knightsDESCR:0 "To Ynnic Knights, the crossbow was seen as a devious device to fabricate strength, the shortbow was the weapon of lowly woodsmen and the composite bow was for bandits. But the longbow? Ynnic Knights admired the Damerian longbow, which required strength and years of training to use. Imported in the nineteenth century, it quickly became one of their favourite tools when out hunting. At the battle of Velencestor in 1811 400 knights fought in the frontline as heavily-armoured foot archers, and their arrows, glowing blue with magic, rained destruction on the enemy musketeer lines by buzzing through several men or exploding upon landing. The future Empress Morvel was leading these archers, having been the one to perfect those magical arrows during her exile in Veykoda. By her campaign's end, the Vytrie Rongukol - Longbow Knights - had grown into a 1000-strong regiment, and more were commissioned during her reign. Veykodan rune magic was applied to both the bows and armour of the knights, with carvings in elegant patterns that enhanced not only the beauty, but also the performance of their equipment. The longbows, with largest surface area of all types of bow, were optimal for rune magic."

True to their factionalist indole, there were two different Tuathak Foreign Legions of which one served the Dragon Dominion, the other the new Sarda Empire. While those of the Dragon Dominion unleashed the power of Eordand's new deadly magirifles, those under the Sarda Empire were infamous for slowly starving their prisoners to death before throwing their bodies into the river, and in battle they wielded poison-laced copper swords similar to Dracball, the sword of Artorean the Dragonslayer, with an obvious message."

Given a light chainmail and a overhand lance, all Ynnic Squires need to do is keep hold of their horse, and steer the magnificient beast as it does most of the job on its own goring and trampling the enemies to death."

With one major difference: Ynnic horses have antlers! A Ynnic knight's favourite method of fighting, when the charge wasn't enough, was to jump down onto the ground and unsheathe his sword, cutting down all enemies who would be as foolhardy as to not break and rout at the sight of his charge."

And why invest all your money into heavy plate armour for yourself, when you needed mobility in order to acrobatically jump off anyway? Due to their proximity to the ironhouses of Brelar, Dolindhan knights were the first to be able to afford horse armour consistently, and they often overlayed it with cloth in the colour of their suzerain's emblem. Most famously, the Amethyst Knights of Amacimst flaunted a bright purple barding."

These Draconic Knights were outfitted in a green, Balgaric-style spiked armour that made them betray no emotion, and, as they traced their lineage to the Dragon-God himself through their Rzentur side, their dragon blood allowed them to wield powerful magic: magic that made them impervious to anything short of a cannonball."

Instead, goblins armed with shortbows along major caravan routes laid in wait for oncoming caravans. They would then emerge and fire dozens of arrows into the caravanners, killing them before they could flee or strike back. Eventually, the Greysheeps would also use these highly experienced and surprisingly accurate warriors for battles, where they would earn their name after a small force of 200 goblins with shortbows held a hilltop for 6 hours against thousands of Gelkar soldiers."

As such, the Marbleheads had to extend the same offer to their human subjects, and though a large amount took it, they only begrudgingly accepted the idea of fighting alongside goblins, who they consider spawns of the Malevolent Dark. Fights, thievery, and murder were common in mixed units, but mixed units were rather effective in battle as the strengths and weaknesses of the humans and goblins complemented each other and showed the potential for continuing such tactics if morale issues could be fixed."

This orange-colored gemstone, found only in Bulwar and surrounding regions, is prized by the Sun Cults, and for good reason. If left under full sunlight for more than six hours, it would shine in the darkness and repel certain undead creatures. However, artificers and priests in the Overclan found that when charged with magical energy, sunstones could be turned into a kind of grenade that would shine with a power akin to the sun for a few moments upon being thrown, turning everything in close proximity into ashes. All Jadd soldiers in the Overclan were issued a couple of charged sunstone gems, but there were specialized units who were issued with vast quantities of sunstone to rain the power of the sun upon the enemy."

The mixture was placed in steel tanks that would launch the volatile sludge using pressurized air and nozzles. The government of the Overclan immediately hired the rogue tinkerers and gave them the funds to set up a production complex. These flamers, as they were called, were issued to only the bravest of soldiers who were called Flame Sappers and given thick armor to protect them from both their weapon and enemy fire, since they had to advance to very close range to use their flamethrowers."

He immediately began reorganizing the regiments under his command to have an equal number of goblins and humans, enforcing a high standard of conduct among his men. He also placed a high amount of importance on firing discipline, forcing both human and goblin soldiers, who previously simply fired whenever their guns were loaded, to coordinate their volleys. When his superiors in Aqatbar saw this, they immediately had Zamuraš appointed as Chief of the Army so that he could spread his methods across the Overclan."

Thus the first iteration of the Sunscorch Handcannon was produced. This highly innovative and extraordinarily dangerous weapon fired a kind of goo, named sunplasm due to its similarity in texture to ectoplasm, which could burn through just about anything. Sunplasm is produced by heating air to very high temperatures with a Damestear crystal, but because it could melt most known alloys, this process was required to happen within the handcannon. This meant that if the process failed in any way, it was the user’s life that paid the price."

While nearly all proposals used explosives in some way, one stood out. Proposed by the military engineer Aminkle Picktooth, it consisted of using powerful explosives to artificially create landslides, burying the enemy in tons of rubble and dirt and blocking the passage of reinforcements. This strategy was put to the test during a border skirmish with Ourdians in 1702, where it worked wonderfully, with hundreds of Ourdians buried beneath smoldering rock. Brokenhammer was rewarded richly, and the Landslide Corps was officially established just a few weeks later."

As expected, the inventions that intrigued them the most were Sunplasm and Goblinfire. They meticulously studied these odd weapons, and to the horror of the rest of Bulwar, actually improved them. They combined the flamethrower with Goblinfire and created a terrifyingly powerful flamethrower that shoots Sunplasm by adding magical wards to the nozzle, pipe, and Flame Sapper armor so that it could withstand the heat of a constant stream of sunplasm.

It was with the advent of the 19th century that they created the ultimate weapon to harness fire in the form of the appropriately named Sunwielders. These humans and goblins are clad in 2-meters tall Damestear-powered exosuits bristling with weapons. In both hands it holds flaming greatswords and in its wrists are False-Sun flamethrowers. On one of its shoulders there is either a device made of lenses that reflects and magnifies the burning heat of the sun into the enemy, on its other shoulder is a gigantic sunstone cannon which fires chunks of sunstone the size of human heads, capable of annihilating concrete walls. Its faceplate is a blank piece of gilded steel with two eyeholes burning with magefire (which can also be used as a weapon), contrasting with the rest of the mech which is the color of ash and lead. These mechanical avatars of divine wrath are thankfully extremely rare, with just slightly more than a hundred in existence due to the immense amount of money and effort that goes into the creation of just a single one, but when they are deployed, nothing can stop them."

Unfortunately for the Overclan, their enemies soon learned that, despite being free from conventional logic, the immolator was not immune to the laws of physics, and exerted a massive amount of weight upon the ground it tread.

When the land awakened and the spirits rose once more, however, the tides turned against the enemies of the Mystic Accord.

The key to their success was their Sunrise Legions, modern human divisions using imported Cannorian weapons who were commanded by elves who had spent decades if not centuries studying the art of warfare.

The formations adopted by Khebtei Teleni naturally placed a great emphasis on defensive tactics, and harassment, stratagems that served them well in the Bomdan jungles. In addition to their rifles these soldiers would often have an excess of grenades which could be easily lobbed at encroaching armies from behind the safety of the 12-Walls. These tactics were sometimes seen as cowardly by outsiders, but the opinions of those with depleted armies and exhausted populations mattered little to the Lord Mayors of Khabtei Teleni."

Through artifice, the power of a spirit could be siphoned and used to craft magical ammunition and explosives with elemental properties and high armor penetration. The extreme difficulty and cost of producing such weapons, however, meant that a battalion of soldiers would rarely have more than two “Spirit Slingers”, and each spirit-armed soldier would possess no more than a  half-dozen rounds of enhanced armaments. Nonetheless, those divisions armed with spirit-empowered weapons consistently triumphed over those who couldn’t or wouldn’t exploit the spirits, cementing the use of spirit-enhanced weaponry in Halessi warfare."

Focused solely on the defense of the Necropolis, the living warriors  of Bim Lau would  fight tirelessly alongside their ancestors to ensure the freedom of the city, knowing that they would rise again to defend the Necropolis should they fall.

They would import and eventually produce Cannorian arms, drill their soldiers according to Cannorian Doctrine and send their generals to Cannor to learn their strategies of war.

To combat the great terror birds of the northern riders, the harimari began to embed their crossbowmen within pike formations that could ward off cavalry. The combination of spear and crossbow became known as the “Thousand Splinter Defense” - its proponents noted that the name described the thousands of sharp shafts the enemy would encounter in battle; its detractors stated that few casualties were inflicted on the enemy because of the defensive nature of the formation, and that it was little more painful than a splinter."

Gunpowder fuses were attached to spears and lit to spray shrapnel and blind enemies when the monks closed to attack, whereupon they integrated their classic spear and claw weapons with braces of pistols that could be drawn, fired, and discarded as they cleaved through enemy formations.

While ensuring that these officers were all battle-hardened and experienced, this practice also badly restricted the ranks of field commanders available to eastern harimari units.

Seeking to reclaim their homeland from the orcs, somewhat tempered in resolve by the embarrassing fall of Vrorenmarch, the sons of Vrorenmarch as guerillas and as mercenaries for anyone against the Grombari. The Vrorensons fought as elusive skirmishers when outnumbered, and in desired battle would form impenetrable walls of deadly pikes."

Led by Steingrim Ebonfrost, said to be the last greatest Ebonfrost, in an attempt to follow the steps of Castan Ebonfrost by conquering Vrorenmarch from the orcs, the Huscarls held the Graytide at bay.

By the mid 17th the Grombari army had become almost completely composed of half-orcs, but this did not herald the supremacy of the Bazrani caste. The Ebontuskers represented the first generations of half-orcs into the army that were commoners instead of Bazrani.

The Ironmuskets were clad in armor unlike the tactics of most contemporary armies, and their regiments more than half composed of replaceable arms such as pikes and rapiers. The Bazrani troops were outfitted with primarily firearms and only small sidearms.

Rather than leading from the front, the Thanes would wait until after the enemy as been weakened and has recently fired to unleash a rousing charge, with great weapons being too much for the unshielded enemy to handle.

As halflings could not wield pikes due to their stature, they developed a new tactic relying on mass fire with lines twelve, six or eight musketeers deep. When the first ranked line fired, they would run move to the rear and the second line would fire.

Due to this it became near impossible to find out where the halfling armies are going as every regiment has its own path.
