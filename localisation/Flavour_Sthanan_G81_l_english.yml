 G81_concealed_knowledge_title:0 "Concealed Knowledge"
 G81_concealed_knowledge_desc:0 "The Dumran Vustarvarch, or Violet Library, is truly the heart and soul of Sthanan ith Vussam, its columned entrance alone, which for one to reach requires climbing hundreds of steps, is visible from every inch of the city. Built as the personal library for a particularly erudite Slaver-Noble, the library contains an immense trove of ancient documents from both before and after the ruin.\n\nThis trove is ever expanding, thanks to the efforts of the Violet Brotherhood, who painstakingly preserve and expand the library’s archives, despite the ravages of time. However, retrieving information from the library is not the easiest task – the language of the Precursors is difficult to decipher, and many ancient documents are badly damaged. By supporting the efforts of the Violet Brotherhood, we may be able to retrieve some valuable information indeed from the depths of the past."
 G81_past_and_future_title:0 "Past and Future"
 G81_past_and_future_desc:0 "Though Taychend is a land of ten thousand gods, and they have doubtless reached ascension in every way imaginable, there can be no doubt that the most patronised hero-cults are those of the warriors and conquerors – those favoured by warlords, not ordinary people. In Thektoram, however, things are slightly different – here, two powerful hero-cults stand, one dedicated to preserving the past, and one dedicated to foreseeing the future.\n\nThe Violet Brotherhood’s dream is to create a Taychend in which every elf, not just the conquerors, has a path to ascension – if that is to happen, we will have to work closely with the Cult of the Fateweaver, and, potentially, grant some of the lesser cults of Taychend some much needed support."
 G81_the_land_of_gardens_title:0 "The Land of Gardens"
 G81_the_land_of_gardens_desc:0 "The fields of Tirsin are among the most fertile in Taychend, only beaten by those of the Kalavend, and the Tirsini have certainly put their bountiful lands to use, creating a land of gardens whose beauty is renowned throughout Andeios. If we are to support our city’s growth as we bring more of Taychend under our rule, however, then it is vital that we turn those gardens to our own purposes, perhaps converting some of those flower beds into rows of maize."
 G81_city_of_violet_cloth_title:0 "City of Violet Cloth"
 G81_city_of_violet_cloth_desc:0 "Sthanan ith Vussam has always been a beautiful city, its streets are adorned with banners of violet-dyed cloth and dominated by the great library at its centre – however, as we’ve expanded, and the city has grown and grown, beauty is beginning to fade, replaced by the cold yet mighty immensity of an imperial Taychendi capital – that cannot be allowed to continue. Let’s renovate our city, restructure streets, rebuild decaying buildings and weave thousands of new violet banners so that our city can maintain its status far into the future."
 G81_a_revenge_overdue_title:0 "A Revenge Overdue"
 G81_a_revenge_overdue_desc:0 "In the death throes of the greatest classical Taychendi empire, that of the Mudaliars, it was said 10,000 bandit kings overran Taychend, claiming large swaths of the region for themselves. Most perished in the following decades, but one stood tall above all – Sibisimra. Dreaded for its might and brutality, the bandits of Sibisimra cut off the Kalavend from the south. It was only the efforts of King Eletam the Gold that stopped them, and it was an effort for which he gave his life.\n\nIf we are to reform the Dumrusvarn, the bandits of Sibisimra must be put to flight once more. It is a revenge long overdue – but that does not mean we cannot find some kinship in the warriors of the area’s forests…"
 G81_woodsmen_drills_title:0 "Woodsmen Drills"
 G81_woodsmen_drills_desc:0 "The woodsmen of the forests surrounding Sthanan ith Vussam are famed for their martial aptitude and knowledge of the terrain – but they owe much of their skills to their Sibisimran origin, having been resettled in Sthanan’s lands by Eletam after they fled from the ravages of the northern city’s bandit-kings. Since then, the two groups of woodsmen warriors have diverged greatly in terms of traditions – but perhaps this can be turned to our advantage. By levying troops from both forests, and drilling both groups together, we may be able to unite the traditions of north and south, and create something stronger in its stead."
 G81_shining_reforms_title:0 "Shining Reforms"
 G81_shining_reforms_desc:0 "The Dumrusvarn relied on a powerful standing military force, the Goldswords, to enforce their rule – a feat imitated by the Gophirans, though they expanded on our success a hundred fold with their Ironblood Army. However, it has become clear to us that the ingredients for a second Ironblood Army have been sowed in our own state. The Captains of the Goldswords have drawn up plans for the “Shining Reforms”, where we shall integrate our woodsmen levies, our professional Goldswords, and the iron-clad soldiers of Yodhanpir into one, formidable army. This process may be painful, though it will undoubtedly give us the groundwork for a powerful force that can maintain control over Taychend forever."
 G81_violet_lords_golden_captains_title:0 "Violet Lords, Gold Captains"
 G81_violet_lords_golden_captains_desc:0 "We have finally done it. Taychend is conquered, and our soldiers, reorganised and retrained, are bringing much needed stability to the region for the first time since the collapse of Gophira. But there is still the danger that we may fall as Gophira did, our newly professionalised military turning on us and bringing our new empire to ruin. A difficult thing to ward off, though one of the captains of the Goldswords thinks he has a solution – in the mould of Eletam and Elajith, perhaps a new heavenly union between the Gold and Violet can bring peace to Taychend, once and for all…"
 G81_united_against_invaders_title:0 "United Against Invaders"
 G81_united_against_invaders_desc:0 "We hold no ill will towards Kheionai civilization, and centuries of trade with them has certainly left its mark on us, but we will not stand idly by while a foreigner forces it upon us. At the Battle of Bukénthia, we faced the army of Ameion alongside Gophira and Tirsin, but when Laskaris slew Dhalikar, the King of Gophira, we were put to flight – he will not have the same luck again. With Gophira’s strength broken amongst the ruins of Kannalulthe, let us unite with our long-standing partners in Nagar Vyechei and the lands of Tirsin, from which the Violetblood dynasty first sprang, and march on Laskaris once more!"
 G81_rebirth_title:0 "Rebirth"
 G81_rebirth_desc:0 "For over 500 years, the city of Sthanan ith Vussam has had a single dream – to rebuild the Dumrusvarn, and restore the light of reason, moderation and stability to southern Taychend. Now, with our northern and eastern flanks secured, it is time to fulfil that dream. Let us march east, expel the Kheionai invaders, and secure Taychend’s future, by restoring the past!"
 G81_blood_of_iron_title:0 "Blood of Iron"
 G81_blood_of_iron_desc:0 "The Yodhanpir – the children of Yodhan – have made it their mission to live up to their namesake. In that mission, it is impossible to say that the Gophirans did not succeed, creating two gargantuan empires from their rugged home in the Iron Hills. In fact, our own dynasty has Yodhanpir blood, and still keeps many of their traditions. With that in mind, we understand the martial excellence of that people, and we know that with Yodhanpir soldiers in our ranks, we can conquer anything. So let’s take a sip of that iron-blood, and raise an army from their lands."
 G81_beneath_the_sands_title:0 "Beneath the Sands"
 G81_beneath_the_sands_desc:0 "The Vustarin, recently brought back into the fold, have taught us much, but there is still yet more to learn when it comes to the remnants of the past beneath our feet. The Sarihaddhi, masters of traversing their desert homeland, have made a living off of digging up artefacts from the dangerous relic-graveyards of their home. If we are to expand our relic operations, it may be wise to “consult” their leaders, and set up new bases of extraction on the borders of the desert."
 G81_seaward_gaze_title:0 "Seaward Gaze"
 G81_seaward_gaze_desc:0 "Vuls Tenvach, our north-easterly Thekvrystana neighbour, has never had the greatest of interactions with us. Indeed, Eletam the Gold, himself a Tenvachi general, had met his lover Elajith through Vuls Tenvach’s occupation of the city – his subsequent betrayal of his home, and the Dumrusvarn’s 200 year occupation of the city, did our relationship no favours. Even now, Vuls Tenvach’s vassal tribes come down from the coastal hills of Uyarbaid, raiding our woodland homes. The only way to put a stop to this animosity is, of course, to subjugate them for good. So let’s march with a seawards gaze, and put this rivalry to rest once and for all!"
 G81_the_scavenger_cities_title:0 "The Scavenger Cities"
 G81_the_scavenger_cities_desc:0 "The Kalavend is littered with the remnants of the past, and the scavenger guilds of that river have been dredging them up for centuries. It is no wonder, then, that our scholars have long been interested in the region – some more than others, as we found out when the ancestors of the Vustarin family left the Violet Brotherhood, seeking relics that they could turn to their military advantage. As our control over Taychend expands, and we come into contact with more of these relics, we must learn some lessons from our prodigal children – after all, the uses of the past are many indeed, and one must never close their minds to learning."
 G81_gold_and_pride_title:0 "Gold and Pride"
 G81_gold_and_pride_desc:0 "Sthanan ith Vussam has always been a centre of trade in Taychend. A cornerstone of the Old Loop that once dominated Taychendi trade, and a prominent nexus-point of the New Loop that dominates it today, with trade coming west along the Straight Road or from south to north through the Vyech. With our conquest of the Kalavend, Thektoram and Yodhanchend, we’ve conquered about three quarters of Taychend’s trade routes – it's time to overrun the rest of it."

 #Events
 sthanan_events.1.t:0 "Under the Cloak"
 sthanan_events.1.d:0 "A shout ran through the lines as one Goldsword spotted activity through the tree line to the right of the road, one blur of movement, then another and another – then the left came alive too, and they were surrounded. The soldiers halted, drawing their blades and drawing closer to their partners as they themselves surrounded their own ruler. Since the dramatic fall of the Mudaliar Empire a thousand years ago, the brush and branches of these woods had been the stalking grounds of the deadliest bandit-warriors in Taychend. But the city that had dominated this region for so long – Sibisimra – now burned in the distance. Only the bandits of Volisi Vara remained, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] could see them gathering in the trees. They surrounded [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], but did not move to attack – they knew why the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was here, with only [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal guard around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], while the rest of their army scorched the stones of their former liege’s home. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was here to offer them a deal.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]’s voice cut through the stillness. “Elves of Volisi Vara, hear me! You see the smoke in the distance! Know the fate of those reavers and raiders! Of those guilty of the greatest crime, preventing the rise of Eletam, the greatest of kings!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] could see the Goldswords around her steel themselves – this would be a difficult fight, but one they would win, through the strength of their love and the surety of their gilded steel. “All elves are offered a choice – to give to the world, or merely take from it. Like Sibisimra, you chose wrong. Unlike Sibisimra, I am offering you a second chance! Cease your ways, and choose glory through service to me! To the cause of a Taychend united by prosperity, by the deeds of those who would build a lasting legacy, not those who would tear down the legacy of others – choose true glory and be redeemed, or else be destroyed!”\n\nThe forest returned to silence, before an elf emerged from the trees. He wore a green woollen cloak around his shoulder, and held a drawn blade in his hand. “Prosperity,” he said, “is the feast of bandits.” A silent tension took hold of the forest once more – until it was cleaved in two by the clang of metal, as the bandit threw down his sword at the feet of the Goldswords before him. “But we have enough bandit-gods in that library of yours. A chance at something new? We’ll take it.”"
 sthanan_events.1.a:0 "We sate Eletam, the bandit’s bane, and please Eletam, the redeemer."
 sthanan_events.2.t:0 "Rebirth"
 sthanan_events.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] grinned as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] progressed through the city’s central square, approaching the steps that led to the Dumran Vustarvach. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] people surrounded [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] at ground level, kept at bay by the newly redeemed elves of Volisi Vara. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHerCap] Goldswords, bonded by love to each other and duty to [Root.Monarch.GetSheHer], lined the Library’s steps – between each pair, a member of the Violet Brotherhood stood, each holding a tome or scroll detailing the deeds of one of the rulers of the Dumrusvarn of old.\n\nThat was why they were here, of course. With the Kheionai invaders rebuffed, the bandits of Sibisimra vanquished, those of Volisi Vara redeemed, and the birthplace of Eletam reclaimed, there was only one thing left to do. [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Dynasty.GetName] ascended the steps of the library, clad in the violet of her blood, and at their pinnacle two lovers stood, armoured in plate and mail of brilliant gold. They held a crown in their hands.\n\nThe last time this had happened, the roles had been reversed. An elf in a violet robe stop at the library’s gates, while the city’s liberator – and his lover – ascended, a traitor to his old home of Vuls Tenvach, and the freshly crowned King of his new one. Though Tenvachi armies marched to reclaim their lost territory, and the bandit armies of Sibisimra watched vulture-like in anticipation, Eletam and Elajith together, the sword and the scholar, cast their enemies aside. For two centuries, the Dannuka Dumrusvarn brought stability, if not peace, to southern Yodhanchend and northern Thektoram. With new ideas and goods trickling into Taychend from the west the arts flourished, Sthanan ith Vussam the cradle of a second Taychendi renaissance.\n\nBut that empire fell, weakened by the destructive ambition of the Great Relic-Lord Kadradar, the Bloodscourge, and finished off by the Chendhyans. For half a millennium, the region had been cast into the dark – but [Root.Monarch.GetName] had brought it back into the light. As she climbed the steps at last, the city fell silent, the crowd waiting with bated breaths. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Sthanan ith Vussam knelt before the commanders of the Goldswords – and rose crowned, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Second Dannuka Dumrusvarn."
 sthanan_events.2.a:0 "The kingdom of gold and violet reborn!"
 sthanan_events.3.t:0 "A Fateful Meeting"
 sthanan_events.3.d:0 "Valawathi, Threadbearer for the Cult of the Fateweaver, walked slowly and solemnly between the assembled priests, as the Apaxagaeda cub in her hands cried out in distress. In any other circumstance, the bright blue eyes of the spotted cub would stand out amidst the darkness – in this chamber, however, the bright light of magic overpowered all else. The skeletal body of its builder – the Fateweaver of Korrimutren – sat atop a pyramid of smooth stone steps, while truesilver cords, connected to rings of greyed-copper and a crown of precursor steel, held her aloft, rising to the immense Damestear-cored device above.\nThe priests were chanting a refrain, gently waving incense-burning censers as the Threadbearer made her way to the altar set out at the base of the pyramid. “Fateweaver, Fateweaver,” they called, “accept this gift! Grant us the surety of your sight!” When the High Priestess reached the stone table, she set out the cub atop it. Two attendants held it down, as the young Apaxagaeda struggled at their touch. Then the Threadbearer’s blade came down, and the cub struggled no longer.\nUltawathan, High Priest of the Violet Brotherhood, watched from the sidelines as the Cult of the Fateweaver’s own priests left post-sacrifice, and their attendants began to disassemble the pomp and circumstance of the ritual. Soon it was just him and the Threadbearer. “So, you wish to reorganise them,” Valawathi said, surmising his intentions, “take the petty cults of Thektoram, those that do not enjoy the patronage of warriors, and take them under your wing?”\nThe Violet Priest nodded. “And those concerning the diviners, the augurs, the haruspices, the far-seers – they shall be placed under you. This is not a mere power grab, Threadbearer. For too long, glory has been clad  in steel and bronze – but the halls of Dhivumanhu are open to all. We must teach the people so – and offer the proper veneration due the gods we forget.”\nThe Threadbearer shrugged. “A fine enough ideal, I suppose. I accept, though I don’t believe I have much choice.” Ultawathan was about to make a noise of complaint, but the other priest cut him off. “You would do well to remember that the Cult of the Fortuitous is greater than those of the diviners who told him he was so.” She turned to the skeletal corpse at the top of the Pyramid. “I’ll relay a message from my patron. Chains of gold are stronger than rope of violet-silk… and chains of iron and steel are stronger than both. There is a reason the Gophirans succeeded where the Dumrusvarn failed. Stay true… or that iron might prove to master you.”"
 sthanan_events.3.a:0 "“Yet in the storm, gold shines whilst iron rusts. We shall see which is stronger then...”"
 sthanan_events.4.t:0 "The Uses of the Past"
 sthanan_events.4.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] couldn’t help but smile as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] inspected the underground laboratories of the Vustarin. They were quite a sight. Great chambers hosted powerful forges, whose flames, bolstered by magic, were hot enough to reforge Precursor steel. Elsewhere, workshops fitted with drawing and drafting tables were laden with both precursor scrap and the notes of the brightest minds of the lower Kalavend. Today, though, they were empty – today it was just the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Dumrusvarn and, by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side, the Matriarch of the Vustarin Family, barely containing her seething rage. “Be proud of this place,” [Root.Monarch.GetName] said, as they finally reached the Matriarch’s office. “What ingenuity!”\n“Ingenuity, yes,” the Matriarch said, through gritted teeth. When [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat down in her office chair, and began looking through the assorted papers on the Matriarch’s desk, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could hear her teeth grind. “It isn’t difficult, actually. To think, for once. Use the brain for more than hoarding knowledge. You know, that’s actually what MY family has been doing, over the past few centuries. Maybe you’ve been too busy archiving books and stories to notice?”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] looked up from the papers, raising an eyebrow and smirking. “Funny you say that, I’d think we’ve quite learnt a bit actually. In fact, I’d say those lessons helped us immensely in conquering your city!” The Vustarin had grown arrogant in their exile – they were originally from Sthanan, members of the Violet Brotherhood – but they had chafed under the culture of the institution and left. “You say we do not learn,” the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] continued, “and that you are a family of action and we are mere hoarders. But you say that, I think, because you have forgotten what truly valuable knowledge is.”\nThe matriarch made to speak, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] cut her off. “Military tactics, methods of working Slaver-Noble steel… to you, these are the only worthwhile uses of the past. Fair enough, the Kalavend has hardened you. But we keep the truth. That there is much to learn from the sage’s wisdom, the craftsman’s discipline, the artist’s creativity and the miner’s endurance. That the warrior’s path to ascension is not the only one.” As the Matriarch fell silent, mulling over his words, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sighed. “But I’m being dour. This is a family reunion, after all! So please, tell me of steel and of war. Your own past is valuable to me as well, Vustarin…”"
 sthanan_events.4.a:0 "“…and by standing together in the present, we brighten the future.”"
 sthanan_events.5.t:0 "The Heavenly Union"
 sthanan_events.5.d:0 "From atop the steps of the Dumran Vustarvach, Sthanan ith Vussam seemed the greatest city in the world. It had certainly grown since the day of the old Dumrusvarn. [Root.Monarch.GetName] could see immense monuments lining the broad avenues of the city’s centre, and beyond that miles of stacked houses, warehouses and factories, workshops and granaries and marketplaces and more. The immensity of the city seemed to swallow [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] – today, the immensity of the empire it ruled heightened that effect. A million elves, perhaps more, had streamed into the city streets for the biggest event since Olhokar’s Festival of a Thousand Years. Today, the Gold and the Violet would be joined in a heavenly union once more – the greatest wedding in Taychendi history.\nIt was a page shamelessly stolen from Banderuttai’s book, of course – the rulers of that city had been marrying members of their bodyguard for a millennium. But that fact didn’t need to be advertised – and besides, it was all in the spirit of the Library. The past was there for the future’s sake. Gold and Violet would once more be reunited in matrimony, just as Eletam and Elajith had been united in love. Love… whether there was love in this match was for the gods to know. The people of course, had their own opinion on the matter. When [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] new husband, gave him a chaste kiss on the lips, took his hand and raised it to the sky, a cry like none [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had heard before rose through the city.\nOut of the corner of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eye, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could see her new consort’s partner – clad too in golden armour – weep silent tears as he looked on with a mix of rage and despair. He had certainly not been happy when [Root.Monarch.GetName] had suggested this. But he had acquiesced, from duty or loyalty. As did many in the crowds beneath the newly-weds. The Mudaliars of Nanru Nakar, the Sangamars of the Iron Hills – powerful warlords and many more wished for autonomy or independence even now. They yearned for glory, and many among them believed that they could only gain that from war, battle, destruction. The Violet Brotherhood would teach them otherwise, one day. And if they refused to learn? The sword of ever-glistening gold was ready, waiting. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] couldn’t help but recall the last words of Eletam the Gold, spoken as he laid dying in the ruins of Sibisimra. A request, and a hope.\n\n“Would you write my entry, Elajith, my love? Our city may find me useful, and I know you to be honest.”"
 sthanan_events.5.a:0 "He was right, and by Eletam’s example, in Elajith’s hand, Taychend is finally ours!"
 sthanan_events.6.t:0 "A Renewed Dumrusvarn?"
 sthanan_events.6.d:0 "It appears the rulers of Sthanan ith Vussam have set out to recreate their ancient realm of the Dumrusvarn. Although we are their allies, it is clear that we are in the way of their lofty ambitions, and they have already sent a messenger to ask for our righteous subjugation. They have shown their might by defeating the looming threat of Ameion, but a Taychendi warlord doesn’t bend the knee easily…"
 sthanan_events.6.a:0 "Their ambitions are noble. We will lend them our support."
 sthanan_events.6.b:0 "They are overstepping their bounds!"
