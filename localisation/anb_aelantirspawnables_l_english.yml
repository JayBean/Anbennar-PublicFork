 aelantirspawnables.1.t:0 "The Founding of Gommoport"
 aelantirspawnables.1.d:0 "The Gommo has had their interest trained on Aelantir for as long as Cannor has known about it. As more and more of the continent was charted, this interest only intensified. There were more challenges to best, more secrets to uncover, and most importantly of all, more land to claim. Preparing for such an expedition is not cheap, however, so any actual excursions have been mostly limited. By the end of the day, this will no longer be the case.\n\nThough it has taken them a long time to get the funds, the Gommo now has the resources to set sail. Their expedition, promising land and wealth to any volunteer laborers, will be setting sail to set up an outpost named Gommoport at the mouth of a river known as the Harafroy. The organization seeks to utilize and best the unique challenges presented by Aelantir to advance the cause of artificery."
 aelantirspawnables.2.t:0 "The Kobold artificer settlement of Zurzumexia"
 aelantirspawnables.2.d:0 "The Dragon Coast has long been a land of strife and hostility. The wars of gnome, human, and kobold may have made the kobolds of the coast as durable as the Dragonheights, and even introduced them to the art of artificery, survival is the top priority.\n\nMoved by a desire to experiment, tinker, and learn unchained from the hardships and limitations of their homeland, a brilliant kobold known as Zurzumex - the pioneer of kobold bio-mechanical artificery - has decided to forge his own path. Joined by a number of his apprentices and like-minded kobolds, Zurzumex assembled an expedition and set sail for Aelantir in search of a land with less need for war, and more time for tinkering.\n\nArriving in Haraf after many months of ocean storms and close calls with hostile ships, Zurzumex found a sparsely populated land with a pleasant climate where Kobolds could prosper and build to their hearts' content. There his expedition established their first settlement, a city that they would build up to match their dream of artifice and freedom: Zurzumexia."
 aelantirspawnables.3.t:0 "Goblin Artificers settle"
 aelantirspawnables.3.d:0 "For decades the city of Bayvek has been a safe haven for Goblin refugees from Escann. Though life in the city was very different from their lives in the Serpentspine, the Goblins’ ingenuity and business savvy has led them to great success: inventive artificers, skilled merchants, and especially the obscenely wealthy bankers of the Sizapzarko bank.\n\nThe successful ones largely view the rest with disdain -- especially impoverished Escanni refugees, and the frustrated goblins who complain about their second-class citizen status. As such, the Sizapzarko Bank has launched an expedition of the most explosion-prone City Goblin artificers, local trouble-makers, and recent arrivals with one goal (they promise) in mind: to found a goblin city in Aelantir. A truly goblin city, built for goblins, by goblins.\n\nWith practically no shipbuilding knowledge but plenty of ingenuity and drive, the Bayvek Goblin Expedition has scrounged together a (barely) serviceable fleet, and founded their city in Haraf. It has been dubbed Mestikardu - derived from Mestin-Nezkaru, "clan town" - to represent Goblinkind working together to build their future."
 aelantirspawnables.4.t:0 "Cestirmark Colony Founded"
 aelantirspawnables.4.d:0 "Since the Rose Party’s victory in the Fourth Lilac War, Cestirander nobles have increasingly felt their influence falter as the duke centralised power in the throne. Some nobles were content to relax in luxury, but in recent years, a new, more energetic generation has risen to the ranks of our nobility amidst a revival of tradition and idealism.\n\nMany of those nobles come from families who used to be minor in united Dameria, but rose in importance in smaller Cestirande. Chief among them is head of the opposition in parliament Varil sína Cymainé who grew tired to see the duke so frequently ignore the position of the representatives, something he feels never would have happened in former Dameria. He even dared to accuse the ducal house síl Cestir of moral degeneracy, claiming they betrayed the values of the Empire just as their ancestors betrayed the Silmunas. His outspoken words thrilled this faction of upstarts and when he was threatened with jail, frustration with the parliament’s decadence boiled over.\n\nForced to take a stance, Varil declared the Empire had forgotten his ideal of equality for all and that a clean slate was needed. Most of his supporters have joined him in his project to create a truly ideal country in Aelantir, and the ducal house made sure to support his position, at least officially, to see these upstarts and their dangerous ideas sail far away from Cestirande! In eastern Trollsbay, sína Cymainé's company has founded the republic of Cestirmark, to be built upon his liberal values."
 aelantirspawnables.5.t:0 "Ebenmas Frontiersmen Ride Westward"
 aelantirspawnables.5.d:0 "Lencenor is synonymous with refined culture, wine and political intrigue. Often overlooked, even by the Lorentish themselves, are the hardy stockbreeders of the western flats. These people are perpetrating a humble way of life dating back from the time of Lorenan itself; but it is a dying one.\nThere was a time when kings were leading the cavalry charge themselves and the tax collector didn't come every year like clockwork, but it is a time they never knew, nor did their fathers' fathers.\n\nAnd yet, in the early 16th century, news came of a land exactly like in their ancestors' tales, a great plain with just as great herds and rumors of noble knights. It quickly became the main subject of conversation in the [GetYear] meeting of the herdsmen of the Ord.\nSome thought they should sell their herds and make a new life in the Expanse. Others thought it was a gamble. In the end, all turned to an old man, Alain, who had spent many years under the warm Lorentish sun, almost as many on horseback, and who was known for always speaking the truth.\n\n'We are riders. Today, like always, we ride. To Westport. To the Expanse!'\n\nAnd so was founded the nation of Ebenmas, named after the endless plain of the western Ynn."
 aelantirspawnables.6.t:0 "Corinsfield Colony Founded"
 aelantirspawnables.6.d:0 "Father Godwin, a Corinite preacher, has recently risen to prominence within Ionntrás calling for a mass pilgrimage to Aelantir in order to found a holy realm. His hopeful vision and virulent anti-magic rhetoric has found purchase in the ears of Escanni hoping to escape the increasingly tyrannical witch kings. These 'Corinspilgrims' now number in the thousands, all determined to forge a better life in the lost elven homeland.\n\nTheir journey was perilous; the pilgrims were forced to endure terrible storms and scale massive cliffs. They were harried every step of the way by rival settlers and natives tattooed with strange magical runes. Few remained when the group found themselves in Tuznviar and beheld a field of red flowers. Father Godwin declared it a sign from Corin herself that they had completed their pilgramage. Now, across Cannor Corin's most ardent faithful speak of a land blessed by the goddess and free from the ravages of magic, Corinsfield."
 aelantirspawnables.7.t:0 "Valorpoint Colony Founded"
 aelantirspawnables.7.d1:0 "One of the most overlooked consequences of the Greentide was the demonstration of the effectiveness of adventuring companies in pioneer initiatives. These organizations were mostly self-sufficient and were able to properly defend themselves from most threats without relying on foreign powers. The existence of already established legal and economic systems under the guilds also allowed the quick incorporation of new territories, as adventurers could accomplish both military and civic duties. The success of the Adventuring Kingdoms of Escann over former realms, like the so-called Count’s League, can be in part traced back to these very advantages.\n\nOne community that embraced these ideas was the Vernmen diaspora. Overpopulation in the Duchy of Verne and in the Luna river city-states and a strong martial culture caused an explosion in the number of vernmen adventuring companies, which found fertile soil in the anti-monstrous paranoia that characterized the middle of the 15th century. These companies had a very tight relation between them, so they were among the first organizations to hear from the success and methods of the Brave Brothers (later the nation of Wyvernheart) in Inner Castanor.\n\nAlthough these ideas were useful in the small scale, the Vernmen adventuring companies would have to wait till the beginning of the 16th century to use them to their fullest potential, with the discovery of Aelantir. This event coincided with an explosion of liberal thinking among retired Vernmen adventurers following Corinite ideals, who started to yearn for the liberty they felt during their time in missions to the wilderness, comparing it with their experiences dealing with the oppressive force of the feudal nobility.\n\nTherefore, in [GetYear] seven of the biggest Vernmen adventuring companies signed the Heartspier declaration, which planned the creation of a state in the Trollsbay, one that could embody these ideals under the name of Valorpoint."

 aelantirspawnables.8.t:0 "The Themarenni Marines Embark For Lavish Shores!"
 aelantirspawnables.8.d:0 "Many Esmarians yearn for the bountiful lands of Aelantir, and many more are simply discontent with serving the decrepit House of Vanbury or the unbridled savagery of the Havoral Band. Countless travelled west alongside other Anbennarians but found themselves amidst strangers and foreigners, with most fertile land already claimed and settled.\n\nThus begins the tale of an unclaimed land of forests, lakes, and rivers. This land bounty reached the ears of these straggler Esmari, whose hopes and spirits were rekindled with fervor. Settlers from along the Esmar and its tributaries, mostly former members of the Themarenni Marines, as well as land-hungry pioneers, gathered together with haste. Passage was found at Yearncliff in the form of six ships commanded by the lesser Themarenni noblewoman Aucana of Sweetcastle. There, with good tide and friendly wind, the bright-eyed and eager-minded troupe set off for the bountiful woods of the Broken Sea Coast."
 aelantirspawnables.9.t:0 "Old Sun Cultist Refugees Found Colony"
 aelantirspawnables.9.d:0 "Old Sun Cultists have always been present in Bahar and the Harpy Hills. Disparate groups have survived in the region ever since the arrival of the elves, and their many small communities thrive in remote mountain valleys, sheltered by the rough terrain.\n\nThe defeat of the akalate of Dartaxâgerdim in the late 15th century ended this isolation. Jaherian Exemplars moved into the Harpy Hills and set pyres ablaze throughout the villages, converting the meek and executing the stubborn. This new age of Darkness led to a rise of Old Sun Cult terrorism, culminating with the bombing of the Samartal Summit. The eventual discovery of the perpetrators, an Old Sun Cult sect with ties to the Green Helmets of Kuzak, led to a new wave of persecution -- which was seen by many Old Sun believers as a sign that the Malevolent Dark had triumphed.\n\nThe rediscovery of Aelantir led to many Exemplars being recalled to their headquarters in Elizna, leading to a marked reduction in persecution. The news of empty lands devoid of Sun Elves and Sun Elven interests was seen by Ageela szel-Akal-Uak as a sign from Surakel. His faithful could build a new life there free from Darkness and persecution, a place to shelter and grow the Light. A priestess with hidden magic ability, Ageela gathered the various communities and set off to build a new land for the faithful of Surakel. With the help of Drolakandi smugglers and her own magical talents, she managed to build a fleet without catching the attention of the elves, which set off into the sunset in $YEAR$. These migrants would end up in the Trollsbay, creating the new state of Zanlib."

 aelantirspawnables.12.d:0 "‘I see our city on a map, spreading not to the four corners of Halann like some vile weed, but growing tall as a venerable oak, up which our citizens might climb to ever new heights.’\n-Journal of Lady Isobel\n\nThe Lady Isobel, a prominent and wealthy widow, is an exemplar of her home city of Toarnaire. Hailing from a near-bankrupt house of minor Roilsardi gentry, she has parlayed a tiny inheritance into one of the most powerful commercial concerns in the city. For the thousands of wage workers in her dockyards, warehouses and workshops, she is a strict but fair employer, a far cry from the arbitrary and cruel feudal barons whose estates they fled for the opportunities in the city. Like most citizens of Toarnaire, she is fiercely independent, urban and mercantile to her core, and a firm believer that one’s horizons should be set by ability and ambition, not one’s station at birth.\n\nAlways shrewd, Isobel knows that her ideals will likely perish in Cannor: she sees war on the horizon, as Lorent and Anbennar rattle their sabers and trumpet their claims to the city. War brings plundering, and she is loath to see her hard-earned wealth carted off to Lorentainé. Hearing of a new land across Uelos’ Lament, she has sold off most of her property and proclaimed a desire to realize these ideals in a new city, far from the tyrants of Cannor. Purchasing a fleet of ships and raw materials for a settlement, she has invited all who would join her in this pursuit of a new life of liberty and fortune - for a nominal fee, of course."

 aelantirspawnables.13.d:0 "Saamir Ruqašah is a name well known throughout Bulwar. Born in the Ruqašah family, one of the Twelve of the city of Bulwar, he learned at a young age the history of Ancient Bulwar and decided to become an adventurer, intent on discovering the secrets history had forgotten.\n\nHis bazaar in the city of Bulwar is ripe with artifacts from his various adventures; there, one can find armors and weapons from the Temple of the Eclipse, genie artifacts from the Lost Ark of the God-King Irsakar the Benevolent, the golden skulls from his Raid on the Serpent's Gift, a golden Phoenix standard buried by Legionaries in Kalib, or even the famed crown of Dalarand lost during the Second Cinder War. There is no place in the whole region which Saamir has not visited or explored, and any civilized ruler of Bulwar has counted him as a guest or a purveyor of antics at one point or another.\n\nWhen news from the rediscovery of Aelantir arrived in Bulwar, Saamir was among the first to react. He sold his various properties, including some of his most precious relics, and commissioned ships for an expedition to Aelantir. He sent messengers throughout the region to offer a new life of adventure in the West to all who would join him, be they human or elf, as long as they were servants of Surael. Caravans of men and women eager to join his search for lost knowledge and adventure, or eager to flee the last decades of instability in the region have poured towards Bulwar and Anzabad where the ships have been built for the expedition. He now stands ready to go into the Sunset to tame and uncover the secrets of the strange lands of Aelantir."

 aelantirspawnables.18.d:0 "Telgeir is well known as the home for the best armaments and armour in Cannor, yet the Guild seeks for more. Precursor steel is revered as a potent material for the best (and most expensive) equipment available. It is rare in Cannor, but seemingly found in abundance among the relics discovered in Aelantir. The search and acquisition  of these relics has become a priority for Telgeir and the vaunted Vanbury family. With only Telgeir under their control, House Vanbury seeks to spread their control to the new world and establish an Aelantir chapter of their famed foundry. Publicly, Vincen of Vanbury was chosen from among the candidates to lead this expedition in its search for precursor relics and to spread Vanbury’s influence for his skills and experience. Behind closed doors, House Vanbury acknowledge that  they chose Vincen to rid themselves of his unsavoury behaviour and to stop the mysterious disappearances and resignations of the other candidates. Regardless, the ships bound for Aelantir embarked with the finest men and women of Telgier to assemble a new foundry which would forge new weaponry from precursor steel; a foundry worthy of the Vanbury legacy.\n\nAs the vessels entered the Torn Sea and the island of Esmaráil was seen on the horizon Vincen proclaimed it would be called Vanburia to honour House Vanbury and to bind the island to their name. Vanburia would prove to be an ideal base of operations in the search of Precursor relic sources as well as a perfect defensive position in any case of strife.\n\nAs the expedition sailed closer to Vanburia they landed upon a protected bay surrounded by wild plains and lush jungle, full of resources to be exploited… As the ships landed alongside the mouth of the river that spilled into the bay Vincen was the first to step on shore. A great port was planned to be constructed, Ricardsport, named so after the only Vanbury King of Gawed."

The famed Calas Silcalas, twice removed cousin of the Marquis of Arbaran steps into the role of Director of the Aelantiri chapter of the Company, and has already reported success in acquiring charts and reaching the rediscovered shores of Aelantir.\n\nAlready, the first ships have already returned bearing exotic goods never seen before in the markets of Cannor, while the original investors are outbidding each other for plantation land around the settlement of New Calas.

The most egregious theft of land and culture happened in Casna Ola, which was forcefully annexed by Lorent -- and in the wake of an army of soldiers came an army of settlers, who forced thousands of Sorncosti off vineyards that had been in their families for generations.\n\nA Casna Ola native named Reán had enough. He gathered the refugees of this bitter crisis in Sornaire, and with the help of patriotic fishermen, naval veterans, and dock owners, his ‘Sornic Sons’ managed to pull together a small fleet of five ships and set sail for the freedom of Aelantir, to be the first to build a new land in the old world. The Sornic Sons' plans were mocked and derided  at first, but once news came back that their first successful settlement had survived the winter, support came quickly. Many Sorncosti now flee en masse to the settlement, in hopes of life without cultural oppression.\n\nWith a pinch of luck and determination, they may be able to succeed at making a new Sorncost and, perhaps, even return to reclaim their homes one day."

None can say for sure if it was due to their growing influence over the temple, challenging its hierarchy, or the strange accusations that the order has of late brought against many nobles in Corvuria.

The teachings of Corin were to fight evil wherever it was hiding, but her followers no longer had a united enemy to face; some became too complacent, some lost sight of their goal; and yet there were those who rejected those fates.\nSurely there was still an evil empire to face, a dragon to slay, an oppressed people to free? But alas, Cannor no longer had any of those.\n\nSo naturally, they started looking further. Corin preached to seek evil after all, not to wait for it to show itself. And when news came of the Drozma Tur, the dragon cult beyond the frozen seas seeking to subjugate all, they all thought the same. Corin preached to fight evil, no matter how hard it is to reach.\n\nAdventurers from all around Cannor rallied here in Istralore, beating heart of corinism in the Empire. Soldiers of fortune, but also bards from Esmaria, mages from Damesear, rangers from the Alen, clerics from Escann, and even some gnome artificers who claimed to have plans for ships that could break through the ice of the Broken sea.\nBut the first to come was Sybille Lánchs, one of the most famous adventurers of all Cannor, and it was obvious to all members of the crusade that her fiery hair and impassioned speeches were proof that she was Corin's avatar even if the clergy refused to admit it. It was no matter, because they had an evil empire to face, a dragon to slay and an oppressed people to free."

Last seen they were...' the scout pauses for a second 'they were heading west.'\n'West?!' the captain replies with surprise. There was only that damned forest to the west, along with those brutish ruinborn he thought. \n'Sir, shall we follow them?' the scout asks his superior. The captain reacted with a small grin. 'No need. Those slaves shall be considered lost goods. They won't survive in that forest anyway.' \n\n...\n\nThe forest changed. It was less dense, the animals appeared less hostile and most importantly - Freemen haven't seen a single Cursed One in over a week. Varbuk kept leading his people after all this time, and it seemed at last that the worst was behind them. His scars from whips have healed, his wrists no longer remembered the tightness of shackles. But most importantly, he forgot his master's face. Instead he only recalled the bloody mess that once was his face. It was a good memory. \nBut that was past.

Over the decades since, Pelodir's new teachings added to the distinctiveness of this new sect, suffering the scorn of both the Ibevar Reformationists and Silent Repose's traditionalists. The discovery of Aelantir and of the Mural of Castellos electrified Pelodir and his devotees - for while the Regent Court was racked with doubt at the revelation of Castellos's death, the sect turned their attention to the overlooked Call for Reflection.\n\nMore than twenty thousand years ago, the Precursor Emperor Aldan passed the Reflective Decree which demanded the return of all elves to Aelantir. For Pelodir, famed for his far wanderings and meandering philosophy, the message could not be clearer: he must answer Aldan's call.

Discontent at their unjust treatment finally rose to an open boil in the early 1500s, prompting the company to depart Cannor's discrimination for greater adventure and opportunity in Aelantir.\n\nReports of enormous wealth found on the borders of the Trollsbay led the Chipped Tooth Company to the lands of the Boek at the mouth of the river Ynn. Here the Ruinborn tribes adorned themselves in finely worked iron and gold that they had discovered at the base of the cliffs of ruin. Surmising that whatever advanced people created these goods would be found on the plateaus far above, the company scaled the Cliffs and emerged into the misty hills of Veykoda. From here the Chipped Tooth made their way east and found the thriving Ynnic civilization, where they found ample opportunities for employment among the petty lords of Sarda and Dolindha.\n\nAt first content to live as landless mercenaries in high demand among the Ynnic lords, the arrival of other Cannorian settlers to the Ynn River Valley led the Chipped Tooth's Captain Otó the Handsome to dream of a land that belonged entirely to the half-orcs. Taking the mercenary band west to the edge of the Epednan Expanse, the Chipped Tooth Company staked a claim over a vast swathe of the sparsely populated western prairie. Declaring themselves an independent adventurer state, the Chipped Tooth became an army with a state, equally intent on living the lives of mercenaries for the Ynnics and as free landholders in their own free piece of Aelantir.\n\n§RThe Chipped Tooth Company will no longer be available for hire.§!"

 adventurerspawnables.11.d:0 "'The Plumwall Exploratory Society Departs!\n\nThe organisation famed for their delves into the ruins of Old Damenath have a new mission: Leaving Cannor entirely, seeking the riches of Aelantir!'\n\n-Excerpt from the Anbenncóst Gazette of [GetMonth] [GetYear].\n\n'Marcan, my dear friend,\n\nHave you seen the headlines? I’ve had over ninety formal requests for a position aboard the expeditionary fleet, and it’s only been a few hours since I received official support. But I’m lucky the Committee made their decision before it all leaked, and instead, I can focus entirely on getting things ready… and getting through this mounting pile of paperwork.\n\nWith any luck, though, it shall all be worth it. Our initial explorers have already brought back fantastic trinkets and treasures -- and rumours of plenty more.\n\nNow, I ought to get back to work. The fleet’s due to depart in only a few short weeks, and I must be sure to call in all the favours we have left ahead of time - the Magisterium can finally consider our work at Old Damenath paid for in full! I trust that you will be joining us, old friend?'\n\n-Correspondence from Adelar Longstaff, Head of the Plumwall Exploratory Society, addressed to Marcan Stonerider, Lead Alchemist."

 adventurerspawnables.12.d:0 "Disillusioned by the Knights Magnificent's laziness and refusal to accept new technologies and ways of thinking in recent years, a large number of younger and more innovative Knights have left Arbaran to establish a colony in South Aelantir.\n\nIt appears that the expedition is sanctioned by the knightly order, most likely to remove the rebellious parts of their organisation peacefully. Calling themselves the Brigade Magnificent, hundreds of knights, along with thousands of prospective colonists and adventurers have today set out today to challenge whatever evils lurk in the jungles, and to tame the lands in the name of civilization. Though the expedition is derided by many in Cannor as mere foolishness, it remains popular among Corinites who have donated a fortune towards these brave warriors seeking out evil to destroy."

 adventurerspawnables.14.d:0 "Dearest [Root.Monarch.GetName],\n\nThank you for your hospitality all these years, and for all the good deeds your line has done for the Jaherian Exemplars.\n\nIn the Exemplars' many years of war in Surael’s name, to my own service with Corin amidst the Greentide, I have come to realize that evil lurks everywhere. The seeds of darkness are coarse, rough, and are found in every single corner of the world. That is why I have made it my, and my order’s, duty to destroy mayhem, and give way to order under Surael. City after city has requested our aid against monster and heretic, and we have never failed to follow through.\n\nBut we have now heard the news of the rediscovery of the homes of our forefathers. The land is said to be abandoned for a few surviving creatures, scarcely elves at all -- in what must be the work of the Malevolent Dark.\n\nThe Exemplars must take on a new purpose: to rescue our kin from the maw of darkness. Surael’s light must be spread throughout Aelantir, and the darkness there will be cleansed, the monsters purged. We set sail in the morning, and by the time you get this letter our fleet will have already left dock. The few that remain are insufficient to carry out the services of the old Exemplars, and for this we apologize.\n\nBut the Jaherian Exemplars must save Aelantir from all that is evil, and bring Jaher's dream to the home of our precursors.\n\nSincerely,\nEcaris."

 adventurerspawnables.15.d:0 "Succession in Harpy society was often fickle and argumentative. As the next Matriarch was chosen from a pool of worthy candidates, being cut out of the running was common and often resulted in bloody consequences. Such an occasion had occurred, as Princess Ašuria Ayarakin, once favoured heir of the matriarch, was barred from the succession entirely. Enraged at having her birthright stolen, Ašuria and her allies attempted a coup against [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The coup was a catastrophic failure, with many of her allies falling in battle, fleeing into exile, or having outright betrayed her during the chaos. She was barely able to escape alongside some of her closest remaining confidants. They fled to Aqatbar, dubbing themselves the ‘Daughters of the Hills’, and brought what meager supplies they and their husbands could carry onto purchased vessels.\n\nWhile the Matriarch would normally seek out such dissidents, and snip these loose ends, word has reached the roosts that their ships sail to Aelantir, the lost continent of the elves. With neither the means, nor the willingness to follow Asuria to such lengths; the looming threat from upstart noble flocks has necessitated that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName] strengthen the position of [Root.Heir.GetName]. Surely a much more treacherous fate awaits Princess Ašuria across the roiling sea."
