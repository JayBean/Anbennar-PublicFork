 aelantirspawnables.1.t:0 "The Founding of Gommoport"
 aelantirspawnables.1.d:0 "The Gommo has had their interest trained on Aelantir for as long as Cannor has known about it. As more and more of the continent was charted, this interest only intensified. There were more challenges to best, more secrets to uncover, and most importantly of all, more land to claim. Preparing for such an expedition is not cheap, however, so any actual excursions have been mostly limited. By the end of the day, this will no longer be the case.\n\nThough it has taken them a long time to get the funds, the Gommo now has the resources to set sail. Their expedition, promising land and wealth to any volunteer laborers, will be setting sail to set up an outpost named Gommoport at the mouth of a river known as the Harafroy. The organization seeks to utilize and best the unique challenges presented by Aelantir to advance the cause of artificery."

 aelantirspawnables.7.t:0 "Valorpoint Colony Founded"
 aelantirspawnables.7.d1:0 "One of the most overlooked consequences of the Greentide was the demonstration of the effectiveness of adventuring companies in pioneer initiatives. These organizations were mostly self-sufficient and were able to properly defend themselves from most threats without relying on foreign powers. The existence of already established legal and economic systems under the guilds also allowed the quick incorporation of new territories, as adventurers could accomplish both military and civic duties. The success of the Adventuring Kingdoms of Escann over former realms, like the so-called Count’s League, can be in part traced back to these very advantages.\n\nOne community that embraced these ideas was the Vernmen diaspora. Overpopulation in the Duchy of Verne and in the Luna river city-states and a strong martial culture caused an explosion in the number of vernmen adventuring companies, which found fertile soil in the anti-monstrous paranoia that characterized the middle of the 15th century. These companies had a very tight relation between them, so they were among the first organizations to hear from the success and methods of the Brave Brothers (later the nation of Wyvernheart) in Inner Castanor.\n\nAlthough these ideas were useful in the small scale, the Vernmen adventuring companies would have to wait till the beginning of the 16th century to use them to their fullest potential, with the discovery of Aelantir. This event coincided with an explosion of liberal thinking among retired Vernmen adventurers following Corinite ideals, who started to yearn for the liberty they felt during their time in missions to the wilderness, comparing it with their experiences dealing with the oppressive force of the feudal nobility.\n\nTherefore, in [GetYear] seven of the biggest Vernmen adventuring companies signed the Heartspier declaration, which planned the creation of a state in the Trollsbay, one that could embody these ideals under the name of Valorpoint."

A proclamation has come from The Necropolis in Corseton ordering they be expelled from all corners of Cannor.
