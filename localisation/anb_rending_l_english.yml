The reason for this ritual remained enigmatic until the temple's influence began to wane. Then, with roaring winds akin to a lion's ferocious call, the desert unleashed its wrath, punishing the wicked and the despotic, wrenching them from their seats of power. A select few, brave enough to penetrate the storm's core, bear witness to its true essence—a tempestuous cloud converging at a singular focus, its face fluctuating between the fierce countenance of a sovereign lion and the discerning eyes of an equally splendid ruler. The fate of a young prince venturing into the storm remains uncertain: either they emerge, crowned with a swirling diadem of sand and wind, or their bleached bones become one with the eternal desert sands."

Doing so would surely be seen as a sign of submission. We can do nothing but hope that their feud ends soon. Until then, unfortunately..."
 rending.551.a:0 "We must oblige..."

 rending.552.t:0 "Siblings, reunited."
 rending.552.d:0 "Finally, the twins have relented in their games. They have contacted our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with an apology. The entire country lets out a sigh of relief, as the two spirits no longer wrestle for dominance over our ruler."

 rending.553.d:0 "Gehet Ketine has decided to challenge us - We must survive!"
 rending.553.a:0 "Oh no!"

 rending.554.t:0 "The Bejeweled Peacock"
 rending.554.d:0 "The Phokhao range looms over much of Haless, with its unending stories told in many books across the realm. The snowy tips can go lifetimes without being touched by the living, but the spirits have been seen drawn to the territories around them.\n\nThe namesake of the mountains themselves have been seen around them, too. The rumours have already been spreading at court - the fact that Phokhao himself has not allowed us to appease him, to obey his commands, could be a sign that the spirits disfavour us.\n\nThus it was decided, an expedition into the mountains would be assembled. A significant amount of the resources from the state would have to be diverted to this purpose, as a large group of pilgrims, nobility, and hired mercenaries would all desire to climb the mountains."
 rending.554.a:0 "Let us prepare!"
 rending.554.b:0 "Leave Phokhao alone for now."

 rending.555.t:0 "Supplies Needed!"
 rending.555.d:0 "The Phokhao Mountains are not welcoming to most mortals. Only a minor number of harpies and some dwarves would ever be able to take up residence in them, which means that there are far too few opportunities for supplies once the expedition is under way. Even with the large amount of things spent on the expedition, the circumstances have caused them to run out of certain vital things.\n\nThere is no more putting it off - we must either send the expedition more supplies at great cost to the state, or abandon this venture for now"
 rending.555.a:0 "Send whatever is needed!"
 rending.555.b:0 "We can't afford this!"
 rending_supplies_needed_no_tt:0 "We will not be able to start the expedition for another 5 years!"

 rending.556.t:0 "Exhausted Logistics"
 rending.556.d:0 "A missive has come from our expedition. There is no more food, the mountain has proven many times more dangerous than we could ever expect, and its inhabitants have been less than welcoming to our presence.\n\nWith advisors arguing loudly in the court, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stares at the letters helplessly. There are only two choices before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows it.\n\nDo we give up, now that we have come so far?"
 rending.556.a:0 "Whatever it takes."
 rending.556.b:0 "This is far too costly!"

 rending.557.t:0 "Dilapidated Pathways"
 rending.557.d:0 "As we begin our ascent towards Lord Phokhao, the very mountains seem to respond to us. Paths appear where there were none before, and when we rest, it is as if the lands themselves shift beneath us. Wherever we tread, the beasts and spirits residing in His territory observe us, either hidden through the shadows, or in plain view.\n\nThis is the first time that the paths haven't led us in one single direction - it seems as if we have a choice before us. To follow the stairs, straight up the mountain, or to take the more rugged dirt path?"
 rending.557.a:0 "Those stones look like stairs..."
 rending.557.b:0 "There's a dirt path..."

 rending.558.t:0 "Ancient Ruins"
 rending.558.d:0 "Ruins in the Phokhao Mountains are not an uncommon sight, they can range from long-forgotten remnants of Harimars empire, to more recently abandoned settlements. Our expedition has found itself walking the long abandoned streets of a forgotten temple, overgrown ruins and fractured walls surrounding what might once have been a place of worship. With the sun rapidly setting, the road ahead seemed much harder than we thought, and parts of our party have already started to find places to set up camp. If we don't act quickly, this short break will end up our resting place for the entire night.\n\nIf there was a reason this temple was abandoned, perhaps it is for the best that we press on... Although that would surely exhaust the party."
 rending.558.a:0 "We do need to keep morale high."
 rending.558.b:0 "Press on."
 rending.558.c:0 "This is a terrible idea."

 rending_ancient_ruins_tt_two:0 "Push the expedition to its limits. We must find Phokhao, quickly."

 rending.559.t:0 "Tunnel of Reflections"
 rending.559.d:0 "Crystals seemed to grow out of the walls of this tunnel through the mountain. With the light at the end barely visible, it demanded a long march through the darkness only lit up by the odd ways the crystals reflected the light of our torches. As the soldiers started marching through in silence with barely a whisper of a word exchanged between anyone, one of them let out a scream of pure terror.\n\nHe claimed that the man in the crystal - his reflection - was staring at him. No-one could verify it, but the crystals had grabbed the attention of the whole party. Some were hesitantly grabbing for their weapons, some were looking at them closer, almost enthralled by them. Most, though, were looking to their leader for direction.\n\nLooking to you, for direction."
 rending.559.a:0 "We could use these as offerings to Phokhao!"
 rending.559.b:0 "March through quickly, I don't like this place..."
 rending.559.c:0 "You know what? Nope."

 rending.560.t:0 "Otherworldly Aggression"
 rending.560.d:0 "Spirits in the forgotten temple came to life in the night, it began with stray, dancing lights... And gongs. So many gongs. A ghostly procession of ancient priests wandered past our campsite, with the air thick with incense, until a stray pebble fell. Every ghostly pair of eyes observed us with an icy stare, either filled with malice or with nothing at all."
 rending.560.a:0 "Wait! We're on the same side!"

 rending.561.t:0 "A Quiet Valley"
 rending.561.d:0 "The path we followed had led us to a valley - whispers and movement kept the party on their toes with every step, the paranoia of the journey having scared them into believing they were followed at all times.\nSuddenly, the forward scout froze, and the words quickly spread through the marching lines. Movement, further ahead.\nAs far as we could tell, it's a simple village, living lives of peace, isolated from the outside world and from the chaos caused by the rending. Could anything be so easy?"
 rending.561.a:0 "Might as well explore!"
 rending.561.b:0 "That is extremely suspicious."

 rending.562.t:0 "Mirrored Reaction"
 rending.562.d:0 "Continuing on through the tunnel, every glance to our sides felt like eyes glaring into us from every corner. The cold misted our breath, and none dared to speak, until they dared to scream. In a single fell swoop, a too-curious pilgrim was dragged into a crystal, his maniacally grinning mirror-clone staring at our leader with vile intent. The tunnel quickly woke into action, with the crystals seemingly coming to life around us.\n\nPanic rapidly spread in the party, and with only a brief moment to call out an order, the leader barked an order-..."
 rending.562.a:0 "Holy- back to the entrance!"
 rending.562.b:0 "Push to the exit!"

 rending.563.t:0 "The Narrow Path"
 rending.563.d:0 "Through the crystal tunnel, we reach a treacherous precipice. Any one misstep could lead to disaster - an avalanche, or a pack animal lost, or even one of the remaining pilgrims. There’s naught but death at the bottom of this cliff, but nothing could have convinced us to turn back now.\n\nWe need to get down this mountain and past these incredibly dangerous ledges somehow, would we expend the supplies on taking our time, watching our every step? Or should we push the party even harder and make haste, every step taking us closer to Phokhao?"
 rending.563.a:0 "No risks need to be taken. Two at a time."
 rending.563.b:0 "We have limited resources. Press on!"
 rending_narrow_path_tt_one:0 "Do we take our time, and not risk our luck?"
 rending_narrow_path_tt_two:0 "Or do we risk it all, and push to the finish?"

 rending.564.t:0 "Landslide!"
 rending.564.d:0 "It began with a single falling rock. The echoes rang throughout the valley, and one could feel the great spirits themselves holding their breath. Until disaster struck. A crack in the rock, and the whole cliff face itself started to fall.\n\nNot just a pilgrim or an errant mule, but the entire party took falls of varying amounts of grace into the waters below. The few broken and bruised survivors who remained looked to their leader for guidance. What were we to do next? How one acts after a disaster like this would go down in the stories."
 rending.564.a:0 "Press on with whoever's left."
 rending.564.b:0 "Regroup at a safer location."

 rending.565.t:0 "Nearing the Summit"
 rending.565.d:0 "The air was alive with a powerful, magical hum. No more spirits had been sighted on our path, and we were surely near Phokhao himself now. The whispers and arguments were already starting - how would we approach our Lord? How would we prove ourselves worthy, and convince Phokhao to roost in our realm, where we can worship him and appease him as he deserves?"
 rending.565.a:0 "Honor Phokhao with a poem"
 rending.565.b:0 "Prepare a ceremony"
 rending.565.c:0 "Shower Phokhao in gold, gifts, and more gold!"

 rending.566.t:0 "The Village"
 rending.566.d:0 "Our scouts who took the first steps into the village had come back… after some time. Their cheeks were red, and the smell of wine was on their breath. The villagers, they claimed, were very welcoming.\nIt was a strange sight to be sure, strange enough that many members of our party thought they were having visions, or that some particularly malicious spirit was taunting them.\nThey were mostly humans and harpies, and having escaped the chaos that gripped the continent they lived near the great spirits territory, where dangerous spirits did not dare roam.\nWe were introduced to the village leader - a mage of some power, who invited us to stay in the village for the night. We have been through enough difficulties, in the morning, they would show us the path to the great spirit."
 rending.566.a:0 "A great kindness."

 rending.567.t:0 "Phokhao, Resplendent"
 rending.567.d:0 "A silent breeze as the sun caresses your face.\n\nThe view of a still lake, calmly reflecting the world above.\n\nThe shriek of a hawk hunting its prey - as melodic as any songbird.\n\nAll of this, and more, is what is felt when approaching Phokhao, the resplendent.\nWith nary a movement his thoughts were known to all of us - a question, a request. What were we here for? What had we come this far to do? There was trepidation, with the wary gaze of the great peacock falling on us, the millennia of captivity leaving every sense sharp as a nail.\n\nEventually, our purpose was clear to him. With proof of our dedication to the Great Spirits, he eventually agreed to roost in our lands, where we could appease our lord as he deserves."
 rending.567.a:0 "A true honor."

 rending.568.t:0 "The Ritual of the Great Elephant"
 rending.568.d:0 "Dhenbasana, our Father Spirit, has begun his great ritual. Already, the people fall into dance in the streets, already, soldiers throw away their arms to join the celebrations. Our ruler has found themselves showered in gold, after a local noble decided to share his wealth with the peasantry... This has quickly gotten out of hand.\n\nAnd Dhenbasana is still chanting."
 rending.568.a:0 "The wheel turns..."
 rending.569.t:0 "A Surge of Energy"
 rending.569.d:0 "As the sun sets, Dhenbasana leaves the ritual chambers. The usually jovial Great Spirit seems calm, for once, simply offering our [Monarch.GetTitle] a glass of wine, as the celebrations slowly begin to die down. An oddity, but the wide smile on Dhenbasana's face betrayed a further change.\n\nAs the sun stopped setting and began to rise again, his powers at full display, a mixture of awe and fear struck through [Monarch.GetName].\n\n'A hundred days of festivals, neverending.', Dhenbasana muttered, walking away, and with each of his steps the state shook."
 rending.569.a:0 "Break, or be broken by it."

 rending.570.t:0 "The Opening ceremony"
 rending.570.d:0 "As the celebrations roared through the city, the many competitors for the spirits' acknowledgment, watching eachother carefully. It was clear that this competition was not entirely about the art - it was also about understanding your opponents. Who would you be able to upstage? Who would attempt to sabotage the others? What scandals could possibly happen at such a celebration?\n\nThe stage was set for an event that would be spoken of for lifetimes, and the only first step was to decide on our path. Who would we support in this endeavour? Who would be worthy of bringing us into the light of the great spirits?"
 rending.570.a:0 "I heard of a great musician in the soldiery... These two like creativity, right?"
 rending.570.b:0 "The court artist will personally paint it!"
 rending.570.c:0 "Search the nation! I want the best poet in the realm by my feet tomorrow!"
 rending.570.e:0 "The [Root.GetMagesOrFallbackName] surely have someone in their midst!"
 rending.570.f:0 "The [Root.GetArtificersName] surely have someone in their midst!"
 rending.570.g:0 "The [Ruler.GetTitle] knows someone personally!"
 rending.570.h:0 "Our race is famed for their artists! We surely know someone."

 rending.571.t:0 "The Matters of Payment"
 rending.571.d:0 "Our artist has been hard at work, attempting to create something to both enthrall the twins, and enrapture anyone in the audience. In the world of art, payment is a topic rarely approached - Some would argue that the honor of creating something for these two great spirits would count for enough payment. They would be famous for their entire lives, were they to win.\n\nToday, our artist approached us with a simple question. "Can you eat honor?""
 rending.571.a:0 "No payment until we win!"
 rending.571.b:0 "Clothe them lavishly and let them live the life of a prince... Until the contest is over."
 rending.571.c:0 "They will live a life of luxury until the day they die - Anything for us to win!"
 rending.571.e:0 "We will allocate them a larger budget... But skim a little of the top."
 rending.571.f:0 "Surely, we can talk about this..."
 rending.571.g:0 "Nothing for you! Everything for me!"
 rending.571.h:0 "We must attempt to counteract the other competitors!"

 rending.572.t:0 "Inspiration - The Wandering Muse"
 rending.572.d:0 "As of late, progress has been slow. More days than not, our artist is staring longingly out of a window. There's many things that can cause an artist to freeze, but none are more dangerous to us than a lack of inspiration. Surely, we can solve this... Somehow."
 rending.572.a:0 "Bah! I have never needed inspiration, just work harder!"
 rending.572.b:0 "Perhaps a view of the Kharunyana? Or the necropolis of Bim Lau?"
 rending.572.c:0 "Anywhere they want! We will travel the whole of Haless, if it comes to it."
 rending.572.e:0 "Our own painter can surely inspire them, somehow!"
 rending.572.f:0 "Inspiration? [Root.Monarch.GetName] can help!"
 rending.572.g:0 "Our lavish court is inspiring to all who visit!"
 rending.572.h:0 "The many dyes in our lands can act as new, inspiring colours!"

 rending.573.t:0 "The Contributions of the Court"
 rending.573.d:0 "The intrigues at court are often centered around personalities - and the removal of them. As of late, the courtiers and the advisors in our court have all been abuzz with the contest, as the rumours of our dashing artist painting a work that could inspire even the great spirits themselves has spread across the country.\n\nSeveral nobles have now approached us, asking for different ways to contribute to this great task."
 rending.573.a:0 "This has already cost us too much! They are on their own."
 rending.573.b:0 "We will accept help from the estates. They can be trusted to not empower themselves."
 rending.573.c:0 "We must rally the full resources of our state behind them!"
 rending.573.e:0 "We know just the assistant!"
 rending.573.f:0 "They must work in private! No distractions, only assist in their work."
 rending.573.g:0 "We can aid them personally."
 rending.573.h:0 "We cannot afford this! They can aid us, instead."

 rending.574.t:0 "The Final Judgement"
 rending.574.d:0 "The final judgement was not a simple affair - It would be held in a grand courtyard, and it would take several days. Each competitor would approach the spirits, offer who they were competing for, as anyone could join, and then perform. There was music, there was food, there were many pieces of art that brought the mortal observers to tears from just a look. But all the while, Hukai and Telebei remained uncharacteristically silent.\n\nAfter several days of apprehension and concerns, the winner was finally announced..."
 rending.574.a:0 "We won!"
 rending.574.b:0 "Second place... Maybe next year?"
 rending.574.c:0 "Fourth place! This has been shameful."
 rending.574.e:0 "Last place. Did we even try?"

 rending.575.t:0 "The Great Purchase"
 rending.575.d:0 "Phokhao has shown us the places he has learned of - The Pearls, in the far away land of Cannor, Isle Vroren, in the cold Gerudia, and the mythical amber palace in Kovtalzar. His intentions are clear - He desires an expansion of his influence. Our state must pay anything we can to allow us to take control of one of these provinces - Only then will be he satisfied."
 rending.575.a:0 "The Pearls! We must make contact with these Cannorians."
 rending.575.b:0 "We already own the Pearls!"
 rending.575.c:0 "Isle Vroren! These mystical soulstones must be ours."
 rending.575.e:0 "We already own Isle Vroren!"
 rending.575.f:0 "The Amber Palace, of course. Nothing but the brightest gems."
 rending.575.g:0 "We already own Kovtalzar!"
 rending.575.h:0 "No! This is far too expensive."
