 roilsard_attract_adventurers_desc:0 "With the end of the Greentide in Escann so has come the time for many of the brave men and women fighting in the war to return as well, while Roilsard is full of these brave people our primary contingent in the war came from the Síl Vivin run Company of the Thorn. With them now returning home, we should see to it to invest properly in housing and servicing these experienced veterans so as to have an army able to defend our reunited Roilsard from any invaders."
 roilsard_permanent_arms_title:0 "Permanent Arms"
 roilsard_permanent_arms_desc:0 "While no one can doubt their military experience we have quickly found an issue with our idea of an army of adventurers, they are too few on account of most remaining to continue the fight in Escann. While we can still maintain a core of skilled veterans to boost morale within our troops a proper army needs size, a size we need to find among properly trained commoners and peasants, no feudal levy loyal to one of the four houses, but loyal to Roilsard, to their home."
 roilsard_jack_title:0 "Jacques Reforms"
 roilsard_jack_desc:0 "Jacques síl Vivin was a competent Roilsardi commander during the Lilac Wars, while he served in our war effort early on in the war he was later fired by the ruling síl Roilsard under vague accusations of treachery that we now in hindsight can see was due to being a part of the rival síl Vivin family. Competent and experienced had he not been fired he may very much have led us to victory during the disastrous battle of Redfort. Nonetheless while the years have gone by, he still lives, looking spry for his age and has even developed upon his old ideas to fit the ever changing battlefield. Now we shall not commit the same mistake that was done during the Lilac Wars and instead we shall use his knowledge to make our army one that any Lorentish knight fears."

 roilsard_tretunic_roots_desc:0 "Long long ago the Duchy of Roilsard was once considered part of the Kingdom of Tretun. However the ancient kingdom is now gone, and its pauper remnants are now under the wine lord of Runbenaire, and we as the Roilsardi people are resurgent. We must destroy the last vestiges of the Tretunic fools once and for all, making it clear that Roilsard bows to no King."
 roilsard_thorned_raven_title:0 "The Thorned Raven's Flight"
 roilsard_thorned_raven_desc:0 "After her departure many were skeptical that Madaléin would return, fearing she would meet a similar fate to those who sought out Aelantir in the past, skeptical of the rumours coming from Lorent of a rediscovered Aelantir. Madaléin, however, did return, bringing with her news of her expedition, confirming the existence of Aelantir and opening many opportunities for exploration to the east."

 roilsard_seat_of_power_title:0 "A Seat of Power"
 roilsard_seat_of_power_desc:0 "With the reunification of the country complete the síl Saloren have come with a promising proposition of a fixed capital in Saloren for the entire country, rather than each house having their own seats of power. While clearly benefiting themselves, Saloren offers promise due both to its fortifications and its distance from the rose that divided us. No matter if we take them up on the offer or not, building the necessary infrastructure to build up Saloren as either our primary or secondary seat of power would be a good idea and would surely greatly please the house of Saloren."
 roilsard_the_saloren_title:0 "The Saloren"
 roilsard_the_saloren_desc:0 "With our rise in power, it was only a matter of time until we seized upon what makes the Wine Lords truly powerful. Let us put our own stamp on the Wineries within our domain, creating a truly Saloreni flavor, and a central market to distribute it. This will both enrich our cultural influence and wealth, as well as fund the construction of a most impressive Capital."
 roilsard_expanding_toarnaire_title:0 "Expanding the City"
 roilsard_expanding_toarnaire_desc:0 "While historically being seen as outside the power struggles in Roilsard, being not owned by any of the four houses, Toarnaire ended up, alongside many other wine merchants, revolting during the Lilac Wars. With this rebellion now stamped out of our city we must see to both building up the city as our central trading hub in the Bay of Wines but also to reassure the merchants that their interests are a part of the interests of a united Roilsard, so as to never fracture again."
 roilsard_merchant_navy_title:0 "Expand the Merchant Navy"
 roilsard_merchant_navy_desc:0 "A powerful navy controls the oceans around Lencenor, and protects our interests abroad. While we cannot hope to match the navy’s of the larger nations, we can expand the merchant marine of the State, increasing our own profits, and creating a bulwark against hostile elements seeking to ravage our independent merchants."
 roilsard_befriend_minar_title:0 "Befriend Minar Temple"
 roilsard_befriend_minar_desc:0 "Following the Lilac Wars, Minar Temple was left in a precarious position, beset on all sides by would be conquerors; they were forced to turn to Wineport, our old rivals, for protection. Now that we have pushed the merchants out of our territory and proven them incapable of protecting Minar, perhaps it would be best if we were to offer Minar our protection instead, in exchange for their recognition in the liberation of the remaining Minari in the eastern Winebay."
 roilsard_reaching_across_title:0 "Reaching Across the Bay"
 roilsard_reaching_across_desc:0 "We have crushed Wineport and the rebels, and freed the Minari under their boot. However there are still some Minari that have yet to come under our banner and the war for the Bay is far from complete. We should offer Minar Temple a position in our realm as a direct vassal of our ruler."
 roilsard_deal_with_lords_title:0 "Entangling the Wine Lords"
 roilsard_deal_with_lords_desc:0 "The Wine Lords of Lencenor are a decadent lot, and unlike us they stand disunited, fighting each other in petty skirmishes and small wars, seeking to gain the upper hand on their fellows. We should show them a new way, united under Roilsard they will have no need for petty squabbles. Of course controlling their land has other benefits, such as allowing for greater control over Wine production in Lencenor, but that is at most a fortunate coincidence."
 roilsard_sack_deranne_title:0 "Those Who Abandoned Us"
 roilsard_sack_deranne_desc:0 "During the Lilac wars the duke of Deranne abandoned us, surrendering to Lorent and leaving Roilsard to die at the hands of the Lorentish. The time has come to take our revenge. We will march and Deranne and do to them what they allowed to happen to us. Deranne will be burned to the ground."
 roilsard_beyond_reach_title:0 "Beyond Lorentish Reach"
 roilsard_beyond_reach_desc:0 "Lorent holds a monopoly on Wine exports within Lencenor, and they charge huge tariffs on our merchants costing them deerly. For this reason the síl na Loop have approached the síl Vivin, hoping to use their overseas expansion and the goods traded there, to supplement lost profits."
 roilsard_bloodsuckers_title:0 "Hunting the Bloodsuckers"
 roilsard_bloodsuckers_desc:0 "Our conquistadors have returned with word of the lands south of our colonies, and what we have heard disgusted us.

 roilsard_many_dynasties_desc:0 "Long has Roilsard been disunited, even during the Lilac wars where we were nominally united under Rean VII síl Roilsard the nobles of the realm bickered and backstabbed, and the end result? We all suffered.\n\nThe time has come to put petty house politics behind us and move forward as a single entity, for what is good for one Roilsardi is good for us all."

 roilsard_public_university_title:0 "Toarnaire Public University"
 roilsard_public_university_desc:0 "In Rubenaire there is a university where many of the Lorentish Nobility study, learning the twisted truths of the Lorentish, and destroying our identity. Our nobility studying at such a university cannot be allowed. We should build our own, in Toarnaire, and allow all the people of Roilsard to attend, where they will learn the glory of Roilsards past and the bright future that lies ahead."
 roilsard_more_jack_title:0 "Professional Standing Army"
 roilsard_more_jack_desc:0 "The Roilsardi are renowned worldwide for their military prowess and many of them serve as mercenaries in realms around Cannor and yet our armies do not live up to this reputation. A new commander has arisen named Jacque síl Vivin, a direct descendant of the Jacques of old! He has identified the issue to be a severe lack of drill within the army, and claims that during his inspection of the army many soldiers disregarded his clear orders, and so has outlined a clear set of reforms that would allow our army to live up to their fearsome reputation."
 roilsard_thorn_gardens_title:0 "The Thorn Gardens"
 roilsard_thorn_gardens_desc:0 "We have triumphed over our rivals and taken revenge for the misdeeds of the past, but that does not mean they are forgotten. Using the spoils gained from our subjugation of Lencenor we will construct a grand garden of thorns, to burn into our history the unforgivable horrors of the past and how Roilsard overcame them. We will not forget."

 roilsard_indivisible_desc:0 "Our enemies lie defeated, their realms incorporated into ours. The emperor is nothing more than our puppet. Our people stand free of any foreign influence and they stand proud. Never again will we repeat the mistakes of the past, never again shall Roilsardi fight Roilsardi, never again shall we be split.

 roilsard_swords_plougshares_desc:0 "While we are now whole, we still live in fear of a possible Lorentish invasion to once more fracture us. But as we have proved and shall continue to prove, the people of Roilsard are strong and our army relies not on elite knights but on that strong populace. We should hand out pikes to every man in Roilsard so that they may be ready for the inevitable charge of the Lorentish knights."
 roilsard_restore_fortifications_title:0 "Restore Local Fortifications"
 roilsard_restore_fortifications_desc:0 "While we cannot guarantee the crushing defeats of the past could harry our future, we can guarantee the defense of the home territories, restoring the abandoned keeps and castles of the old ages to project their power back into the surrounding fields. This has the beneficial side effect of making the peasantry feel safer from marauding bandits as well as foreign armies."
 roilsard_peasants_title:0 "Co-operation of the Peasantry"
 roilsard_peasants_desc:0 "Our nation is built upon the people, and on a grander scale, the nation reflects the desires of those that live there.

 roilsard_resurgence_desc:0 "The vineyards of Roilsard are impressive, but they are a shadow of what they once were, ravaged by the Lilac wars. We shall rebuild them, even more grand than what they were. They shall be the crown jewel in our rebuilt Nation, a treasure we shall not lose again."
 roilsard_end_ties_title:0 "End Lorentish Ties"
 roilsard_end_ties_desc:0 "Following the reformation of Roilsard there seems to have been some uncertainty as to where we stand relative to Lorent, and they have sent many a diplomat to our realm seeking to re-establish our vassalage. This will not do, Roilsard is not Lorentish and we should make that clear to them."

 roilsard_thorn_in_lorent_desc:0 "We have seized Carneter from the hands of Eilísin, and yet the duchy lies open unprotected against any possible Lorentish invasion. Further the emperor expects us to fortify our lands after the aid they sent, and the síl Roilsard seek to make good of this deal."

 roilsard_expand_frontier_desc:0 "The county of Roilsard, seat of the síl Roilsard, sits on the border of Lorent and is, much to their dismay, often the first county to fall in the case of a Lorentish invasion. The síl Roislard have long seeked to change this, moving the Lorentish frontier further from their lands, should the opportunity present itself they would certainly be grateful if we were to conquer the nearby Lorentish towns."

 roilsard_around_the_bay_desc:0 "After the initial conquest of Lorent an opportunity has arisen, if we were to take the duchy of Lower Bloodwine we would be able to connect our lands in the Winebay and Roilsard proper and cut Lorent off from the Bay entirely."
 roilsard_sack_lorent_title:0 "Those Who Betrayed Us"
 roilsard_sack_lorent_desc:0 "Roilsard was once a vassal of Lorent, however during the Second Lilac War they proved themselves unfit rulers, asking for levees and taxes that our people were unable to sustain, and so we were forced to secede and join the empire, unfortunately the Damerians were defeated, and with them our then ruler Rean VII síl Roilsard who fought bravely until the end. Following this Lorent did the unthinkable, shattering the duchy of Roilsard and giving our lands as a prize to their ally Rubenaire. Whilst they may have shattered our realm, they did not shatter our spirit and Roilsard fought on. Today we have shown the grave error of their ways, and they will be made to pay dearly for their crimes."

 roilsard_integrate_lost_desc:0 "Following the Aldresian crusade many Roilsardi settled in the estearn borders of the empire, but despite of the people living there have had their Roilsardi heritage suppressed and see themselves as ‘Arannese’ rather than Roilsardi. An except to this trend is Toarnen, where the nobility continue to practice Roislardi traditions preferring to style themselves as Roilsardi.

 roilsard_reclaim_carnteria_desc:0 "Carneteria is considered part of the empire but it lies outside the influence of the emperor, as the new defenders of the imperial border with Lorent it would be wise for us to restore this duchy to the Empire, strengthening our position in the empire and weakening Lorentish influence in the region."

It is clear that if we are to be recognized in the empire then we must do so by force, the imperial capital of Anbenncóst lies not far from our realm and with the imperial fleet and our grand army besieging it would be an easy task.
