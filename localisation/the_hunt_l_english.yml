 #Decisions
 
 the_hunt_myna_decision_title:0 "Adopt Doctrine of the Myna"
 the_hunt_myna_decision_desc:0 "Our shamans debated what posture the Hunt should take towards the religious practices of subject peoples within the territory of the flock, and have at last reached a decision. The guiding example of the myna bird shall be followed. Common throughout Bulwar and Rahen, small myna birds nest communaly, and form flocks with a variety of other birds. What others may believe shall be of no concern to us, and the Hunt is ours alone."
 the_hunt_falcon_decision_title:0 "Adopt Doctrine of the Falcon"
 the_hunt_falcon_decision_desc:0 "Our shamans debated what posture the Hunt should take towards the religious practices of subject peoples within the territory of the flock, and have at last reached a decision. The guiding example of the falcon shall be followed. A keen-eyed bird of prey, the falcon searches both the sky and the land as it hunts. In recognition of the primacy of the Hunt, it shall be spread to heathens. Though they may still revere their own gods, in culture and philosophy they shall join the Hunt and empower it."
