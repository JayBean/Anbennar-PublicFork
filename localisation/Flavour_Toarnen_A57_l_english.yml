 A57_guard_the_folly_border_desc:0 "Our county is one of the least defended places in the Empire bordering both the Daravan's Folly and the Divenhal Sea: the raids are frequent, villages or hamlets are destroyed every month by gnolls, and worse, gnollish slavers from across the sea steal and abduct our pale-skinned citizens and see them as mere cattle to be sold to faraway lands like the days of ancient Milcorissia.

But it don't suffice, after they start speaking the Roilsardi dialect perfectly, we have to ban the Wexonard dialect on the pretense that it is incomprehensible to us - which I mean, isn't true, but it might as well be!"

 A57_spit_on_celliande_desc:0 "Look at Celliande, a rotten land full of scoundrels who seem to have forgotten their roots, and stick to this so-called "Arannese" identity!

 A57_an_incident_in_sorncell_title:0 "An Incident in Sorncell"
 A57_an_incident_in_sorncell_desc:0 "Some of our spies in Celliande have a sweet idea: dressed as dockers, they will kill a foreign rich merchant by making a crate fall on him. We will give Toarnen Black Blood to other dockers beforehand so this incident starts a fight while our spies fade away."

But thanks to Sugamber's troops and to Busilar's navy, only the fringe part of our territories were occupied. We have a great debt towards those who protected us and even if the war finally ended, we need to keep our links with them now that we are strong enough so they don't see us as weak as a Lorentish teenager."
 A57_the_defender_of_the_east_title:0 "Eastern Bulwark"
 A57_the_defender_of_the_east_desc:0 "Arannen, Sugamber and Brinkmarches are considered as the shields of the eastern parts of the Empire against any invasion from Corvurians, elves, gnolls and worse.

 A57_borrow_teinmas_desc:0 "The Elfrealm of Ibevar isn't really a realm composed of only elves: in what they call Téinmas, Arannese humans are a majority. We can't allow this weak-minded Arannese culture to thrive in another country after all those efforts! But we like elves, their legends are as glorious as the Crusade and most of our nobility and Roilsard's is composed of "half-elves". Thus, we will just borrow Téinmas. The Elves strangely asked we borrow it for four hundred years and that we pay half of it now and half of it at the end of the deal, with inflation included : As the past seems to be more glorious than the future in Anbennar, we have no reason to refuse."

 A57_a_roilsardi_heir_desc:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is heirless and nobles start to quarrel about the which one of them will be chosen by her!

 A57_roilsardi_immigration_desc:0 "We may still be Arannese but we are very attached to far away Roilsard.

Of course we expect Arannese farmers to not being happy about it but our county still have a lot of empty places in the woods to settle them."

 A57_we_are_the_true_roilsardis_desc:0 "After wearing Roilsardi clothes for many years and exemplifying their virtues, our people can't really be considered as the same than other Arannese. In fact, we are not Arannese. The conquests and subjugations of Roilsard by Lorent forever put a stain on today's Lencori Roilsardis who become soft-bellies and lackeys to a foreign power. If those in our ancestral homeland cannot bear the legacy of our people, then we shall be the ones to rise to the occasion!"
 A57_finish_arannen_title:0 "Finish Arannen"
 A57_finish_arannen_desc:0 "At the North of us only lives foolish and weak Arannese realms. Arannen, their namesake, and of Roilsardi like us, is the biggest offender as it is a old relic beaten hard to the Lilac Wars: To lead the Crusaders north again, will we must crush the decadent marquisate."

 A57_northern_arrays_title:0 "Northern Arrays"
 A57_northern_arrays_desc:0 "The recruitment of new troops is becoming more and more necessary due to the growth of our county and the Roilsardi population gifted us many childrens who are not protected by treaties made for their parents.

Lucian síl Vivin, the legendary Roilsardi crusader who was given the title of Protector of Corvuria by Jaher, being one of them himself!

 A57_promote_the_toarnen_black_desc:0 "Emíl síl na Loop did much to import Roilsardi wine to Toarnen and develop the Toarnen Black Wine.

 A57_export_our_wine_title:0 "Export our Wine"
 A57_export_our_wine_desc:0 "Toarnen isn't and never was a trading hub and our geographical position does not make our county suitable for major trade.

 A57_find_a_plaids_importer_title:0 "Find a Plaids Importer"
 A57_find_a_plaids_importer_desc:0 "The small pastures we have are providing to Toarnen a small but high quality wool, that is mainly used to make our famous black-and-white plaids we have become known for. Like our wine, it would be a nice addition to our revenues of we manage to establish business contacts and sell it beyond our borders."
 A57_black_and_white_fashion_title:0 "Black and White Fashion"
 A57_black_and_white_fashion_desc:0 "The Roilsardi immigrants are mostly farmers who had not much for themselves: here, they are seen as heroes and glorious workers who deserve a bright future! Seeing our beautiful plaids made poor Roilsardi immigrants envious and now they try to wear those colors even on ragged clothes, they truly are patriotic as we are. Those colors are also a symbol a refinement especially for those who play chess, but nobody really knows which came first between chess black-and-white colors and our plaids."
 A57_build_the_settlements_title:0 "Build the Settlements"
 A57_build_the_settlements_desc:0 "Clothes aren't everything to make a home. Thus, we pressured a five years-long tax on burghers to fund new houses to the Roilsardi immigrants.

 A57_popularize_chess_variants_desc:0 "Leslinpár inhabitants play a strategy game called the Cones of Leslinpár which is known for being too difficult to the population. Preventing the population to learn strategy and war is silly, that's why we will simplify the Cones of Leslinpár and make it playable on a chess board : each player will have sixteen same pieces on the board, and the goal is to eat all the ones of your opponent. As the rules are easy, it will be a good introduction to chess for the lower classes."

 A57_teach_chess_to_cannor_desc:0 "Chess can't stay a niche game only played in Toarnen and others few places in the Empire!

Fifteen countries will participate, fifty rulers fighting not in the battlefield but in front of the same table. Of course, the Emperor will be invited and hosted with the greatest honors Toarnen can offer. Just one more rule will be added to the tournament to prevent any cheating: no magic allowed."

 A57_toarnese_grandmasters_title:0 "Toarnese Grandmasters"
 A57_toarnese_grandmasters_desc:0 "Having so many chess experts in our country, it would be silly not to take advantage of their strategic talents to rule Toarnen better. All advisors about cultural affairs must have won at least one chess tournament in Toarnen to be able to take office."
 A57_chess_and_war_title:0 "Chess and War"
 A57_chess_and_war_desc:0 "Some of our advisors are the best chess players among all Cannor, but how can a Toarnese ruler be proud of himself if he isn't drilled to deep thinking and too deep strategy?

 flavor_toarnen.1.d:0 "Nearly ninety years ago, burghers and some nobles led an insurrection against Toarnen and called the Moon Party to help, nearly costing us our independence. Their motivations were that the síl na Loop dynasty had increased too many taxes and levies in coastal areas of the county over the decades compared to the previous dynasty, a branch of the síl Arannen who bended often to the burghers. To calm their anger and to prevent war, the count Alann met the burghers at the port of Whitecliffs and conceded a treaty which granted a consequent autonomy to Bordercliff and to every port between Bordercliff and Sorncell."

To a mixture of applause and uncontrolled laughter, the countess declares that this party is the last of her reign and that now, in order to realize this dream, the whole duchy must prioritize a stronger society."

Among them are some of the world's greatest, Magnus of Gerudia, to the young savant Eílisabet to Casperion, an elf who has been studying chess since the days of the Sorcerer-King! As per our standards, they are all dressed up for the chess competition, wearing beautiful black and white outfits and many of which are made in plaids made by our own artisans. You sit on a wooden throne in the shape of the chess piece representing a king, everyone waiting that you start the tournament. But instead of staying bored on the throne, you sit down at a table and challenge a young boy (who you later realized was a gnome). The contestants soon realize that the contest has just begun and run to the chess tables."
 flavor_toarnen.4.a:0 "May the best win!"

 flavor_toarnen.5.t:0 "Defeated but Stronger"
 flavor_toarnen.5.d:0 "Thanks to the education of our ruler, clever tactics, and the fact that chess is a Toarnese pastime, we have made it to the semi-finals, but unfortunately, your challenger, Magnus, has beaten you thanks to a promoted pawn left on the left side of the chessboard."
 flavor_toarnen.5.a:0 "I learned a thing or two, at least!"

 flavor_toarnen.6.t:0 "The Winner of the Contest!"
 flavor_toarnen.6.d:0 "The final game is one of the most impressive since tournaments are made in Aiscestir. It is you against the elven grandmaster, Casperion. You open with the Countess' Gambit, while your opponent defends with the Busilari defense. The Aldres' variation puts your first line at risk, but you manage to transform your opening into a King's Lorentish Attack. You can see his sweat while he tries a Gnomo-Bulwari Defense. You push his pawns towards a corner as the elf is forced to concede defeat as your two queens threaten his king. The mansion is shaken by thunderous applause and the servants bring the trophy, your crown and a bag full of gold."
 flavor_toarnen.6.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is the Chess-Master of Toarnen and maybe of all Cannor!"

 flavor_toarnen.7.t:0 "Like Petals on a Calm Sea"
 flavor_toarnen.7.d:0 "Something unexpected arrived: Lorent administrators knew our plan since the start and let many Roilsardi go. As farmers depart, Lorentish landlords and loyalists come. Roilsard rebels will never be able to rise up but at least, Toarnen is their new home. But requesting an exceptional tax to \"free our kin\" don't make our population happy, thus organizing a shorter migration wave would help our finances and the population would be more favorable to our plans. But a bigger migration would make Toarnen much stronger on the long-term and a real example of how we never forgot our roots."
 flavor_toarnen.7.a:0 "Let's fund a short migration, take on board only the most loyal to Roilsard."
 flavor_toarnen.7.b:0 "Everyone will have a ship, and a rose on his hat!"

 flavor_toarnen.8.t:0 "The End of the Vampires?"
 flavor_toarnen.8.d:0 "Toarnese soldiers could be heard from far away, shouting while destroying the few remaining standing houses around Arca Corvuria. Corvuria had been sacked, not for loot but for another thirst: the one of purging Cannor of monsters, this time forever. The walls of the citadel had been breached and the door exploded as cannonballs fired at it. Then, chaos ensued. The plaids became red and black like the mantle of some crusaders of the old times while the population remaining in the city was white like chalk due to their bloods being used by the vampires. Many soldiers, proud of their ancestry, recognized some vampires because they looked strangely like the paintings hung in their family homes. While some have thought of ending their lives to make up for the dishonor of having cherished traitors for years, other groups of soldiers went into a fury, slaughtering anyone in their path. Entering the center of Arca Corvur, the soldiers realized that the place was empty, that the síl Vivin and others families of traitors had fled. In anger, most of the city was razed and those who had not managed to flee were impaled."
 flavor_toarnen.8.a:0 "Will we know one day what really happened during the Crusade?"

 flavor_toarnen.9.t:0 "The Sacking of Arca Corvur"
 flavor_toarnen.9.d:0 "As the flames get dangerously close to the palace, some powerful vampires want to crush the Toarnese soldiers once and for all. But such a massacre would reveal the existence of the masquerade to the whole world and a real crusade would come after the Toarnese one. Thus, the solution undertaken by a majority of vampires is to hide in Asheniande and develop the network from there. We will take back Arca Corvur one day, but letting these weaklings take the city can only leave tears in some eyes."
 flavor_toarnen.9.a:0 "The Masquerade is still intact, but today is a grim day for us."

 flavor_toarnen.10.t:0 "The Crown of Thorns"
 flavor_toarnen.10.d:0 "A huge crowd was called and even more people came, most of them Roilsardi immigrants or their offsprings. A giant and free banquet was planned in New Toarnaire as today is the Coronation's day, where the Crown of Thorns, crafted by skilled elven smiths, will be shown to the population.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] arrive on the stage where the three flags of Roilsard, Toarnen and Corvuria fly high and open the casket, revealing a crown of an unusual shape: it is a crown only composed of thorns. Made in gold and silver, each wavy band of thorns is in a different metal. The thorns are only on the outside to not hurt the wearer and is very light despite the use of dense metals.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] put the shiny crown on his head, the flag-bearer reveal a flag with a red background, the crowns of Roilsard and Toarnen merged in the center, the Corvurian white crow to the right and the Crusader's emblem to the left. [Root.Monarch.GetName] then yells to your crowd : \"It is not the end to our glorious victories, Roilsard must be freed from impostors and kinglets! May Corin and our ancestors guide us across the seas!\""
 flavor_toarnen.10.a:0 "Glory to Toarnaiste, the March of the Eastern Thorns!"

 flavor_toarnen.11.t:0 "Organizing the Settlements"
 flavor_toarnen.11.d:0 "Most Roilsardis finally arrived! We are giving them some lands around Aiscestir and welcome them with open arms. To keep them happy, they will pay us less tax and the first generation of newcomers will be exempt from conscription. Some of our farmers aren't happy as they are pushed back to the suburbs of the city and they have less places to cultivate but in the other hand Roilsardi immigrants are much more loyal to us. Meanwhile notaries run across Aiscestir as they weren't prepared to administrate so much immigrants, let's hope everyone have a house for winter."
 flavor_toarnen.11.a:0 "Welcome to your new home, brothers!"

 flavor_toarnen.12.t:0 "Cultural Renewal"
 flavor_toarnen.12.d:0 "\"Our ancesters were tall as three halflings! We are shorter because we walked so much during the Aldresian Crusade that we shrank.\" said the history professor to his young students. \"But then why the Roilsardis who immigrated here are only two halflings tall?\" replied one of them. Shaking hands, the professor removed his glasses, took a glass of Toarnen Black and grabbed the twelve-year-old student. \"The Lorentish! They took everything! Including your ancestors' height! I can't take it anymore, let me die on the battlefield! Oh and class is finished, see you tomorrow.\" While the teacher left sobbing, the students were gloating about the next traditional Roilsardi riding class."
 flavor_toarnen.12.a:0 "I wish to be crusader one day!"

 flavor_toarnen.39.t:0 "Murder at the Port"
 flavor_toarnen.39.d:0 "While a rich Busilari merchant was inspecting merchandise in the port of Sorncell, a crate fell on him and a fight broke out when dockers started to accuse each other. While the culprits are unknown, it seems some of the dockers fled on a small ship and went east, on the road to Toarnen or to Nathalaire."
 flavor_toarnen.39.a:0 "Was it the pirates or our insane neighbors?"

 flavor_toarnen.13.t:0 "Toarnen Threathen War!"
 flavor_toarnen.13.d:0 "Following the accident at Sorncell, we found one of our diplomats in Toarnen was found covered in tar and feathers lying at our borders. He told us that Toarnen demand that we cede Sorncell or that they will burn our country."
 flavor_toarnen.13.a:0 "We must defend Celliande against those mad dogs!"
 flavor_toarnen.13.b:0 "Let them take Sorncell, we will counterattack later."

 flavor_toarnen.14.t:0 "Celliande Refused"
 flavor_toarnen.14.d:0 "Celliande refused to give up Sorncell, we have now the choice to go to war with those herring-heads or to delay our glorious victories to another day"
 flavor_toarnen.14.a:0 "To war! Leave no Celliander uncrushed!"
 flavor_toarnen.14.b:0 "...Maybe another day? It's nearly dinner time."

 flavor_toarnen.15.t:0 "Celliande Accepted"
 flavor_toarnen.15.d:0 "Victory, Sorncell is ours without even having to lift a finger. Indeed, the only one we raised was a waving hand, directed towards a soldier running away in terror, dripping urine in his fear!"
 flavor_toarnen.15.a:0 "We will feast in Sorncell's halls!"

 flavor_toarnen.16.t:0 "Toarnen propose to borrow Téinmas"
 flavor_toarnen.16.d:0 "The so-called \"Eastern Roilsardis\" have now knocked at our door to ask to buy Téinmas at the pretense that we are an Elfrealm and not an Arannese one. This proposal is so ridiculous that we proposed that they paid half of it in four hundred years, with inflation included. Those idiots accepted and now we have the choice to accept or refuse their proposal."
 flavor_toarnen.16.a:0 "Of course! Four hundred years is nothing to us."
 flavor_toarnen.16.b:0 "Never allow a Toarnese envoy here again."

 flavor_toarnen.17.t:0 "Ibevar accepted!"
