 favoured_IC.tempstart.d:0 "Unlike the misguided fool followers of the Regent Court, those that embrace the true Court do not simply waste away “reflecting” or “praying” to prove their fervor to their patron deity. No, we act, through shows of debauchery, cruelty, and malice. Particularly gratuitous acts might even catch our Court’s eye and enable one to have a chance to become an “Elevate”, a mark of proof that they stand above the weak and the mulling.\n\nAs it were, our priests believe that such a chance might be yours, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. And while it is no surprise that the Court has taken notice of your “activities”, there is no doubt to earn the Mark, more must be done. Indeed, the state will have to be second while the Court watches your next moves."
 favoured_IC.tempend.d:0 "For five years, you’ve given yourself entirely to your Patron. The wrongs committed. The excesses indulged. The malice inflicted. All of it for you and your Patron.\n\nWere the self-righteous fools of Regent Court to look upon you and your black soul, they would gape in horror. And, perhaps, it is for that reason that you stand as an Elevate. For where others recoil to even consider what you have done, you simply smile."
