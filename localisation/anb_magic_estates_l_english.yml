 magic_estate.3.t:0 "Host Magical Feast"
 magic_estate.3.d:0 "The basic test of journeyman conjuration is looking at images and summoning a magical copy of it, essentially creating a duplicate.\n\nMasters however, can create entire rooms and decorations with their mind and imagination, making the most fantastical ideas true and possible for the short time the conjuration spell lasts."
 magic_estate.3.a:0 "A year's worth of events should do"
 magic_estate.4.t:0 "Encourage Plant Growth"
 magic_estate.4.d:0 "Apprentice mages often learn life-related transmutation magics by experimenting on plants, which is agreed to be a much safer way to teach the consequences of failing to alter living things than using animals or, heaven forbid, people!\n\nMany mages earn a great living in practical spells like this, and can use magic to encourage growth in plant life, creating healthier, faster and even tastier crops and food."
 magic_estate.4.a:0 "Let's do it"
 magic_estate.4.b:0 "§RUnavailable (requires farm good provinces)§!"
 magic_estate.5.t:0 "Scrying"
 magic_estate.5.d:0 "Scrying is the act of looking through a medium (usually a crystal ball) to see far-away events or even foretell the future. It is the foundation of most divination spells, and in this case refers to the base-level spell of seeing events happening elsewhere during the present.\n\nScrying is most effective when given as a recurring task for a group of mages, as it allows a larger area to be watched at all times, in addition to a greater support network.\nScrying on our rivals will allow us to subvert their spy network and use it against them. Scrying on our neighbors will allow us to more easily fabricate claims on them and steal any institutions we do not have. Scrying on internal dissidents will help prevent revolts. Scrying on war combatants will help our armies in the field."

 magic_estate.6.d:0 "Through the power of the mind many mages find work in the labourious task of construction. From transmuting materials for easier usage or transportation, to using telekinesis to carry heavy objects, magical prowess finds itself a place in all forms of industry."
 magic_estate.6.a:0 "Aid Constructions"
 magic_estate.7.t:0 "Empower Wards"
 magic_estate.7.d:0 "Defensive Wards can come in all shapes and fashions, from enhancing the resistance of objects such as walls, creating magic shields and barriers, to glyphs and runes acting as traps.\n\nMost contemporary castles had some sort of ward, at least to protect them from low-level magic attacks like fireballs or magic missiles, and this was the source of steady work for many beginner mages."
 magic_estate.8.t:0 "Rite of Conception"
 magic_estate.8.d:0 "The Rite of Conception is in-fact a series of magical spells and concoctions combined to increase the chances of having a magically-gifted child. The Rite is most infamous during the bedding ritual itself, which generally involve an ornate magic circle drawn beneath the bed of consummation, as well as a mage in the room itself during the act to ensure the circle remains strong and to provide any other magical aids.\n\n§B(Requires a consort. Costs legitimacy if you already have an heir)§!"

 magic_estate.12.b:0 "This child cannot be made into our heir!"
 magic_estate.12.c:0 "Our existing heir will remain our heir!"
 magic_estate.13.t:0 "A Magical Birth"
 magic_estate.13.d:0 "The magically-gifted child created through the Rite of Conception has been born, but not without some complications.

 magic_estate.18.a:0 "We decide how to organize our mages, not you!"
 magic_estate.18.b:0 "Very well, we will return control."


 magic_estate_rite_of_conception_tooltip:0 "The mages will perform a spell to attempt to create a Powerful Mage heir. The chances of it succeeding increases as the mages have more influence, and if the ruler or consort is already a Powerful Mage."
