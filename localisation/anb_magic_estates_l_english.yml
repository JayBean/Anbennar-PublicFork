 # magic_estate.5.d:0 "Scrying is the act of looking through a medium (usually a crystal ball) to see far-away events or even foretell the future. It is the foundation of most divination spells, and in this case refers to the base-level spell of seeing events happening elsewhere during the present.\n\nScrying is most effective when given as a recurring task for a group of mages, as it allows a larger area to be watched at all times, in addition to a greater support network.\n\nScrying on our rivals will allow us to subvert their spy network and use it against them. Scrying on our neighbors will allow us to more easily fabricate claims on them and steal any institutions we do not have. Scrying on internal dissidents will help prevent revolts. Scrying on war combatants will help our armies in the field."
