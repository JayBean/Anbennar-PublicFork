 gemradcurt_dead_trial_at_darblath_desc:0 "The news of Eighard's great disaster at Minnorac was good to be sure, but despite the death of their ruler, Andrall Harvestcrown, their city stood tall, and they have been recovering their strength ever since. But the Icewarded-Walls of Darblath are not unbreakable - with the Winter united, it is time for Gemradcurt to lead the charge in destroying one of its most perfidious foes.\n\nAnd, of course, Immarel has her own mission. As her power grows, spurred on by the Everfrost Prince, she has gained access to even greater arcane power - especially in the forbidden field of necromancy. While she used some of this during her initial counter-attack against the Autumn, she has yet to trial these powers on a large scale - and the devastated remains of Darblath seem just the place."

 gemradcurt_the_taigan_supremacy_desc:0 "Immarel Winterswrath has enjoyed a close and intimate relationship with the Taigan Order, which was previously only responsible for the arcane education of young women within Gemradcurt's borders. After she rose to power, however, nobody had expected the extent to which she would empower and expand the role of her order. Membership was expanded to include men, and the Order gradually consumed more and more responsibilities within the country. However, this process is not yet complete - in order for Immarel and Gemradcurt to protect the nation and the Winter, the Taigan Order must reign supreme over the country, so that her authority and power may be absolute."

Immarel has received plans from her fey patron, and has already set her resources to the task of creating a device to bring about a change in the power balance of Eordand forever; a machine that will secure the Winter's survival.\n\nTo this end, she has begun the construction of the Frostspear: a massive tower of twisting metal and ice that shall be seen by all for miles around - and underneath that tower, work has begun on a chamber that shall contain the very heart of winter..."

 gemradcurt_unite_the_winter_desc:0 "When the hated Autumn first began their forays into our lands, the Winter Court stood disunited, seemingly oblivious to the mortal peril they were in. Even as the realms of the east fell, and the Tuathak despoiled our native lands, the nations of the north fought alone, too proud to see that united they would stand a far better chance. It cost us dearly.\n\nAnd yet even now, with the Autumn's unity shattered at Minnorac, many within our sister-realms of Gelcolle and Reotcrab have seemingly put down their arms, and refused to take the steps necessary to protect our way of life - and to make matters worse, there are even whispers that Gelcolle would dare to consort with the enemy in Raithtall. To Immarel, this disturbing news has shown her clearly what is to be done - if the Winter is to be saved, it must be united. And if that must be brought about by force, so be it."

No longer!\n\nUnder the leadership of Gemradcurt, we have united our territories and pushed back the invaders, reclaiming the lands of the north for ourselves. But still, our job is not finished. If we are to avoid another catastrophe like this again, we must marshal our resources once more, and strike deep into the heart of Autumn! With whatever means necessary, the future and destiny of our people and faith will be won - and the Everfrost Crusade will see it so."

And not to mention the threat from within our borders. Disregarding the Tuathak remnants, there have been concerns raised about our own people, who chafe under our rule, some openly criticizing our new, aggressive Winter Court.\n\nBut the Everfrost Prince has given Immarel a solution to this - personal powers unimaginable, so that she may secure the survival of Winter forever, and so that the Snecboth will never again see the devastation of the Hibernal Crusade. With the instruments of life gathered around her, and the resources of the North under her control, the previously daunting requirements for this ritual of his have become more achievable by the day. If Immarel is to secure the future of winter forever, perhaps this most drastic step must be taken?"

She had declined, feigning tiredness, but in reality she was simply shocked. The decades long struggle against the hated Autumn had been ended by Peitar hands, not by that of the Snecboth.\n\nFor a time Immarel was thankful, but as the Strutmari's grip on the Snecboth lands of Imatt and Fasacglan tightened, her mood soured. Now, the path forward has become clear to her - winter alone must secure its future, not rely on the charity of those who would otherwise seek to shackle it. The lands under Strutmar's control must be retaken by force. After that, who can say what will happen to its Peitar occupiers?"

For too long, the tenets of the Winter Court have been weak passivity and defensiveness; Patience and inactivity that nearly fatally weakened us when we faced our most bitter struggle against the Autumn. Over the years, the people of Winter have begun to break out of that mindset, with Immarel leading the charge in Gemradcurt, but the time has come to spread this new worship of winter across our realm, so that we may never again face a disaster like the Hibernal crusade."

The Everfrost Crusade, Winter's righteous campaign into the heart of Autumn, has been wildly successful, and now Immarel stands on a defeated and broken people, those self-proclaimed successors of Eighard’s legacy, and leaders of the Autumn Court; now chased to their last bastion at Einnsag.

And so before they unite and strike, we shall divide and break them with our newfound power. Soon, all of Eordand shall be ours, and there will be nobody left to challenge the survival of Winter."

While there is no doubt that they must be convinced of the supremacy and brilliance of Winter, there remains the question of how best to deal with these southern cultures. Thankfully, in our dealings with the Tuathak and northern Peitar, we have already shaped the path we will take - no matter what, all of Eordand will be united under Immarel's new "Everfrost Court.""

Not only did Jahainar Truespear's expeditionary force assault her from the forest, and not only has the Domandrod proved to be an incredible tool for the Eordand Fey to strike down those it views as too dangerous (as seen at Minnorac or Dorcurt) the forest represents the last and most powerful remnant of an Eordand that was, where Winter did not reign supreme. This cannot last.\n\nImmarel has, with the aid of the Order of Arcane Sciences and the gifts of the Everfrost Prince, finally gathered the resources she needs in order to break down the walls and wards of the Domandrod, and seize the groves for herself. The population of the Old Forest has swelled from the many, many refugees that streamed into it during and after Immarel's conquest of Eordand, and they will surely sally out to face us, and harass us once we enter the forest; but that is no matter - Gemradcurt and the Everfrost Court shall claim what is rightfully hers!"

The Peitar have had great success by retreating deep into the forest and harassing our forces in lightning raids. Every day, men and materiel are lost, as the terrain has proved a great obstacle to our undead soldiers, and our living ones dread being assigned to a place they see as a death trap - but this cannot last. Despite the obstacles, our settlements in the forest push ever inwards, and it is only a matter of time before we secure our rule in the Domandrod for good. By constructing fortifications throughout the forest, and pacifying the population, Immarel shall be at last the new mistress of the Domandrod."

The Domandrod has long been thought to be rich in resources, selfishly hoarded by the fey and their Peitar favourites, and the Order of Arcane Sciences' surveys in the region have only confirmed our suspicions. By constructing a series of plantations within the forest, where petty and political prisoners alike shall labour under the canopy in order to extract the forest's resources, we shall greatly enrich ourselves."

Under her direction, the researchers at the Order of Arcane Sciences have completed their first trials on infusing elven bones with metal through a complex transmutation spell, though only Immarel has the power and skill to attempt to refine the spell so that it works on its desired target - an undead skeletal soldier.\n\nThough the field of transmutation is shunned by the Everfrost Prince, the idea of legions of steel soldiers marching in lock-step through the streets of Gemradcurt has captivated Immarel's mind, and she has been awaiting its upcoming trial with giddy anticipation - her new "Rite of Steel and Bone" will allow her to fulfill that dream, and if it requires some transmutation magic to do so, what's the harm?"

 gemradcurt__original_purpose_restored_desc:0 "When Immarel was admitted into the Taigan Order, it was of minor stature compared to the Moraine and Tarn orders, only being responsible for the arcane education of young women. When the Lady Mother took power, and she first expanded the Order's power by allowing the admission of young men with arcane potential as well, nobody expected that this would only be the first step in the Order's meteoric rise to power. By the end of the Everfrost Crusade, the Order controlled nearly all functions of the Gemradcurter state.\n\nBut this great expansion in the Order's remit and duties came at a cost - it's original purpose of arcane education was sidelined as order manpower was increasingly drawn to other projects. If Gemradcurt is to maintain a large base of skilled mages with which to uphold its magical requirements and duties, then it must turn the Taigan Order back towards its old purpose. To that end, an Arcane Academy shall be established in the archives of Arakeprun."

After the end of the Red Winter, the words of Immarel put all doubt to rest - the winter was her doing. Across Gemradcurt, only for a few months of the year did the temperature rise high enough for agriculture to be sustained, and for much of the rest, the world fell under darkness.\n\nThe worst effects of the winter were countered only by careful preparation. Fortifications were constructed to store grain, warmed by magic, and houses were reinforced against the Everfrost. In many places, the Red Winter had "corrected" the population in favour of the new situation. But if Gemradcurt is to remain prosperous, this is no good solution - we must devise a way for the greater population to be protected from the icy grip of winter. And, thankfully, bright minds have just the solution: the "Hearthwards", a series of complex enchantments and spells designed to protect an area from the glacial onslaught of cold, and allow for sustained farming throughout the year - a state-provided shelter from the storm."

Already, members of the educational staff at Arakeprun are working on less expensive (though less powerful) Hearthwards, that may be constructed much more easily than their greater counterparts. They have seen great success, and have petitioned the Lady Mother for increased funds for the project.\n\nIn response, Immarel has gone even further than their original request. Seeing the usefulness of their endeavours, she has ordered the formation of a new "Order of Arcane Sciences", headquartered in Arakeprun but with branches in Gemradcurt and Murdkather. Combined with the increasing development of the sources of Precursor Relics, so prominent in the region, the OAS will have ample resources to enhance and advance our technological abilities, including their lesser Hearthwards project that may prove to revolutionise Gemradcurt's economic situation..."

Now, they have come to Immarel again with another brilliant new idea - with extensive application of both lesser and greater hearthwards, and the necessary infrastructure and population within a city to support them, they believe that they can create "Hearth-Cities", havens in the winter from which extensive urban populations can thrive, so long as they are supported by the rest of the population. If seen through, this project might be able to give Gemradcurt the edge it needs to compete with the more populous and prosperous nations of the world."

But as Immarel's power has grown, the Frostspear's facilities have become inadequate for the administration of her new realm. Therefore, Immarel, with the aid of the premier architects of the OAS, has devised plans for a new building that will form the centre of her realm - the Lady Mother's Tower.\n\nAn awe-inspiring structure, likely the tallest in North Aelantir, and perhaps even the world, the Lady Mother's Tower will be a pyramid-shaped shard of ice, metal and glass, towering into the skies and casting a heavy shadow over the streets of Gemradcurt. Reinforced and protected by Immarel's magic, every floor will have ample space for government and order civil servants to work in; the building's floor layout inspired by the halfling "house-stacking" methods learnt from Cannorian traders. In addition to this, an extensive underground network of every arcane or industrial facility imaginable will be built below the tower, so that Gemradcurt will once again be the beating heart of the nation's undead military. From her office at the very highest floors of the building, the lady in the high tower will have her entire realm at her fingertips."

We know that is not the case - our eastward expansion is merely defensive in nature, and we have no need to threaten the human colonists to our south. Therefore, in order to secure our place on the continent and protect our nation from the potential reprisals of our ignorant and frightened neighbours, we must take it upon ourselves to educate the Cannorians of Aelantir that we are, above all else, a respectable power."

While the Eiganrac's pre-existing military division, the Eiganrac Riders, has proven sufficient until now, we cannot ignore the increasing demands on us. Luckily we have the perfect candidate to achieve this end.\n\nThe "Everwinter Brigade" of the Eiganrac Order's military wing have proven their worth time and time again in the Expanse, repeatedly routing and defeating Epednar raids decisively and with great speed. Nicknamed "the Everwinter Knights" for their tenacity and noble spirit, that resembles the Ynnic cavalry we have fought time and time again near the great river, we shall expand this group into a new division of "Everwinter Riders", so that they may be another sword-arm of Immarel's will."

Tougher, deadlier, and more responsive to commands than their previous ramshackle iterations - by marshalling our resources and improving the production of steel in our new, expansive foundry in the Domandrod, we shall begin mass production of these new undead soldiers, and soon all of our enemies will tremble when they witness the sight of our advancing army, and the rhythmic crunch of their steel frames."

However, on top of the order's issues with underfunding, their position under the control of the Taigan Order has reduced their efficiency, as both an extended chain of command and the Taigan Order's expansive mandate has made their operations slow and unwieldy.\n\nIn order to fix these issues, Alwaron Ferwylt, a prominent figure in the Eiganrac nicknamed the "Jester" for his previous occupation, devious mind, and impressive command over illusion magic, has presented a series of proposals for expanding and enhancing the organisation. By forming an entirely new "Eiganrac Order", whose Esbagg answers directly to Immarel, increasing the funding given to the new order and enhancing and expanding the Eiganrac's purview and powers, he hopes that they will prove an essential asset to the security of the realm. Perhaps Immarel should take the young man up on his suggestions?"

By sending them to the Reokests, where they may cool their heads while working off any damage they may have inflicted on state infrastructure, these prisoners may be rehabilitated and sent back to their families!\n\nAnd were they to mysteriously perish during transit, or succumb to the not-so-stellar working conditions of these camps, there are ample Eiganrac officers nearby ready and willing to resurrect their corpses just in case.

Combined with the threat posed by naval attack, Gemradcurt must construct a fleet to rival the other powers of Cannor and Aelantir, so that we may both protect ourselves from attack from the sea and increase our dominance over the northern waters of Aelantir. And to that end, we shall construct a grand home for said fleet, the Reotcal, or "frozen harbour", from which our power may be projected across the waves."

 flavor_gemradcurt.1.d:0 "Immarel considered the words of the scout as she sent them out. A renegade band of a few hundred Hibernal Crusaders, the marauding remains of that bloody war. When Immarel had driven out the Tuathak from Gemradcurt, and the Peitar had killed Harvestcrown at Minnorac, many presumed the Hibernal Crusade - the existential threat to winter that had consumed the north of Eordand - over and done with. Immarel knew better. The Tuathak would not stop until the Winter Court was exterminated. Even now, remnants of the Autumnal armies still remained in Snecboth territory, looting and killing to their hearts content. They had to go on the offensive to see winter secure, that was for certain...\n\nA man's voice, slow-paced and clear as ice, interrupted her musings - Immarel turned to face the sound. Before her stood an elven-looking man, his skin a pure white and his hair and bright eyes an icey blue. Clad in furs and ornate snow-white armour, he was beautiful, appearing as some divine link between the Winter and elvenkind. The Everfrost Prince, her patron, stood before her. An Archfey.\n\n"You will ride out against the Autumn - but do not forget what I told you before. Beyond the means of destruction lies a far higher power...!"\n\nImmarel nodded affirmatively, turning back to her desk and retrieving a quill and paper - orders. The partnership between Immarel and the Everfrost Prince had been long and fruitful - whether the Prince's influence or her own extraordinary powers came first she did not know, but from her earliest days Immarel could remember the soft words and harsh advice of the Archfey. She had called him "the Frostman" back then, before she knew of his true nature and power. It was he who had spurred her to push past the deaths of her parents with grim determination; to seize direct power from the "militarist faction" that thought they could control her; to push back the Tuathak and embark on this final journey - and, luck willing, he would be by her side when she seized the ultimate tool that would secure Gemradcurt forever."

 flavor_gemradcurt.6.d:0 "In the Great Hall of the village of Daidh, a massive host was assembled. Hundreds of Snecboth warriors, nobles and burghers had joined Immarel and the Whitehand and Winterstrider rulers of Gelcolle and Reotcrab, in celebration of the unity of the Winter Court and the Snecboth people in their fight against Winter. Meat, drink and merriment was abundant. Even Immarel, normally stoic and always fixated on some goal or other, seemed totally at ease. But, as with that stoic and calm demeanour, this was but a facade over her true feelings. In truth, she was nervous - there were constant rumblings in her circle about the disloyalty of Gemradcurt's comrades in arms, and some even wished for them to be brought under Immarel's personal control entirely. And, of course, there were many among the vassals’ people who chafed under the Taigan Order's control. When one of these advisors, a high ranking member of the Taigan Order, had approached her the night before with a plan to wipe out the leadership of Gelcolle and Reotcrab at the great feast, and secure Gemradcurt's authority over the north in one fell swoop, she had waved him away - but she had not denied him. She knew, even as she played the merry ally of the two Dukads on the dais, that many Gemradcurters in the room had their eyes on her - waiting for a signal to strike.\n\nAbruptly, Immarel stood up and called for quiet. The Gemradcurters did so quickly, as if they had just been ordered to do so by a commanding officer, but the Gelcollers and Reotcrabers took some time to get settled. She raised her glass to the assembled Snecboth.\n\n"10 years ago, the nations of the north joined together to stand against the Autumnal invaders, and since then, we have fought alongside each other as siblings. We've gained victory after victory, and now we're at the precipice of securing the future of the Winter Court forevermore!" The hall erupted into cheers . After it died down, Immarel continued. "But still, there exist divisions among us... cracks in the unity that has been so essential to our success." Immarel saw one of the officers on the tables place a hand on her sword... she only had to say the word, and the room would erupt into blood. "But that ends today! At this feast, in this hall, we shall built a brighter future, and strengthen the machine that will destroy the Tuathak once and for all! And we can only do that...""

 flavor_gemradcurt.7.d:0 "Snow fell as the Taigan Order soldiers piled the last of the Tuathak bodies before her. The taking of Darblath had been extremely costly, with the Ice-Warded Walls of the city giving Immarel a great challenge, but in time they had fallen before Immarel and her forces, and the city was now under Snecboth control once again. Despite the cost, however, the Everfrost Prince had taught her something - behind every victory on the field lay another, hidden success. As her arcane powers grew, it had become necessary for her to trial her newfound abilities on increasingly grander scales, in preparation for what the Everfrost Prince had assured her would be a most taxing ritual. And so, after Darblath had fallen, Immarel had ordered her soldiers to gather as many dead warriors in the city together as they could. The result was a horrific affair, and though the bodies had been frozen through magic to stop much of the decay, the sight of so many dead still brought unease to some of the assembled officers. But Immarel knew, of course, that such a display paled in comparison to the numbers killed by the Tuathak. A fitting punishment!\n\nImmarel's guards turned with a start as a white elk approached from behind. When she turned around however, she waved them off as the rider dismounted - he was the Everfrost Prince in disguise, an antlered white helmet over his head to conceal his otherworldly appearance. He leaned close to Immarel, and spoke with his usual glacial demeanour. "This is only the beginning. When you have reached the heights of power, you shall be able to command the very world as you would these soldiers. Remember this..." Immarel nodded, stepping forward as the Everfrost Prince watched on alongside her bodyguards. She raised her arms.\n\nThe blue glow of magic engulfed the square, as limbs within the tangle of bodies began to twitch and shudder. Soon, there was true movement - unnatural, stiff movement, as if the bodies were being puppetered by some invisible master above them. Then, the pile came alive, as hundreds, then thousands of undead began to reanimate fully. Immarel strained under the stress of the spell as her head began to ache and her arms began to burn with exertion, but soon enough she managed to wrestle full control of the assembled host. A few commands, and the mass before her had moved into some grim imitation of an organised force. Immarel smiled."

The will of the Strutmari had been broken, and they were willing to surrender entirely. Gazing at the fortress in the distance, walls breaking, and surrounded by Snecboth soldiers and reanimated Peitar alike, Immarel opened her mouth to speak, but Captain Ishera, a trusted supporter and lieutenant who had joined the Order at a similar age as Immarel (albeit as a novice trainee), interjected. "Immarel, we should take their offer. It's no use storming the city if we can take it peacefully... and besides, these folk helped us in the Hibernal Crusade. It was the Strutmari who killed Harvestcrown in Minnorac! What's the use in-"\n\nAnother voice interrupted Ishera, as another of Immarel’s lieutenants - Captain Talaran - rose to speak. "Where were the Peitar when they invaded in the first place? They only attacked when the damn Tuathak had been looting our lands for decades! And not to mention Imatt and Fasacglan. Unless you think that Immarel's birth town is rightfully Strutmari land, then I think you ought to-"\n\n"Enough!" Immarel's curt command cut Talaran off immediately, as Ishera stepped back from her impending escalation, crossing her arms. Immarel knew that the Peitar had done winter a great service at Minnorac, and had seized Fasacglan and Imatt from the Tuathak invaders, not native Snecboth states. But their refusal to return the provinces, and their rejection of the supremacy of Winter did pose a problem - who knew that these folk would not one day pose a threat to Winter's security?

 flavor_gemradcurt.9.d:0 "Immarel entered the underground chamber uneasily. Even now, she could hear the noise of construction above her head, as the workers erected the largest building Immarel had seen in her entire life, even in its unfinished state. Under her direction, they had built a monumental construction, with an even greater expanse of works underneath. It was incredible, but as she walked within the tunnels and chambers of the Frostspear's subterranean levels, she wasn't entirely sure that the whole thing wouldn't come tumbling down on her head. She would have to get over her fear, however, for in this place lay the key to her destiny. In the heart of the chamber - which itself was large enough that the centrepiece seemed dwarfed by its surroundings, with a high ceiling and lots of space around the object - there was a large, glowing-white crystal, mounted on some Precursor device, and punctured with many assorted tubes and cables, connected to the roof as if they were holding the crystal up. Before it stood the Everfrost Prince, looking deep into the Crystal's confines.\n\n"The Heart of Winter... and with the instruments of life gathered around you, this shall become the epicentre of your power." As Immarel approached him, the archfey did not move, though she felt obligated to give him space. "When the long night comes, you shall bind your soul to the Heart, and eternal power will be yours..."\n\nThe words "eternal power" still affected Immarel in the same way they did when she first heard them. What the Everfrost Prince offered was eternal life - her soul would be bound to the Heart of Winter, her "phylactery", from which she would be able to control her own living body, or potentially that of somebody else, though that process was time-consuming, costly, and would effectively kill whomever it was done to. The Everfrost Prince had explained that this method, while being costlier and more dangerous, with the Heart having to remain within the Frostspear, would leave her stronger and with more vitality than traditional "eastern" methods of the same process, though Immarel did not know of what eastern land he spoke of. With her own wintry magic, she could freeze her mortal body and extend its vitality threefold, only needing to transfer to a new one once the old body was irreversibly aged or damaged. This was a power fit to guide the Winter Court to a brighter new future - and with only a little more blood and sweat, it would be Immarel's to wield."

Immarel had done it. Even now it seemed hardly believable to her - she had destroyed the realms of Autumn, and ended the centuries long conflict between Snecboth and Tuathak for good. She had won.\n\nBut what now? That was the question on the minds of many that had gathered there. Immarel came to the square at the town's heart, before the building that used to serve as Einsagg's centre of power. Her lieutenants were there, alongside a large part of the troops in the city. They were waiting for orders - all but one, of course. Captain Ishera moved forward, to pre-empt the words many expected from Immarel's mouth: She spoke of the innocents in the city, of the madness and senselessness of it all; Of the old way; Of the peaceful and moral and just life we used to live, before we were forced to take up arms against the invaders. Talaran and Serondar, hardliner captains both, attempted to shout over her, to accuse her and belittle her before the assembled troops, but Immarel stood them down with an ice-glare, and continued listening in silence.\n\nWhen Ishera had finished her appeal, seemingly all her energy spent on her own last stand, Immarel dismounted, and approached her. The square watched on in anticipation, Ishera in desperate hope. Immarel placed her hand on her old friend's shoulder. "Ishera...""

It reminded her of an earlier time, before she had set her own nation alight, and brought every measure of destruction to the lands she called home; When she had sat by this very fire and contemplated a terrible nightmare... calamity made manifest. Ruin written across the north in letters dripping red, staining the very snow red with blood. She saw, and she did not understand. She chose wrong. Or, at least, that was the thought that kept her up at night; That followed her in her most private moments; That chilled her to her core.\n\nBut there was something that kept the faith in herself and her choice alive. She had won the struggle she brought on her nation, and now she was in an unprecedented position to mould it to her will, to throw every resource into ensuring this would never happen again. But those words still rang hollow - sitting in this room, by this fire, she remembered making the same vow, with a different antagonist. Something had to change. Immarel had to think differently. Safety, security - vital, yes, but had she really been treating them so? Or had those words just been a cover for the wrath and burning desire for vengeance that had consumed her since she saw her home taken from her by the Tuathak, since she had seen family and friend alike slaughtered like vermin for reasons alien to her to this day. The wrath that had reduced half the nation to ash.\n\nImmarel took her hands away from the fire. It didn't matter really - she had lost most feeling in them long ago. She remembered, soon after her ascension, resolving not to bother taking a new body until her old one had crumbled to dust or been destroyed. She didn't need to feel - she could exist apart from and above her own people. But that wasn't good enough - that attitude, that loss of feeling, had led her into committing the most terrible crimes. Immarel shook her head, and grabbed a quill and paper from her desk, writing an order calling for a young woman of her height and size to be brought to the Heart-Chamber. She would not rule as a cold skeleton, but as a flesh and blood elf, who ate and slept and adored the warmth of a fire just as her subjects did. She would still have to oppress her subjects, of course, crush dissent, break rebellions, stifle freedoms and liberties - but no longer would she do so as some cold tyrant, for her own wrath and rage and personal power, but for the prosperity of her people; So they may live in blissful harmony under Gemradcurt's banner and Immarel's protection.

"Are you wearing a night-gown?"\n\nThe minister was taken aback, indignant once more. "Why - yes, I am wearing a night-gown! And I'm wearing one because I act decisively and with great speed, Iwandir! Now, if neither of you are going to provide any worthwhile leadership, I think its time I-"\n\nThe Commander of the Eiganrac cut him off, standing up with a start.

The operation had been a disaster - the last thing she could remember was a fire-bolt knocking her unconscious. She looked around the unfamiliar room. "Where are we, Warmal? This isn't the usual safehouse."\n\nWarmal shook his head. "Too hot, had to pick a new one - as far as I know, though, that's the only one that's compromised."

A perilous journey of many months, with cataclysmic storms and death winds consigning sailors to the bottom of the sea, aquatic monsters devouring vessels and terrestrial ones preying on crews in resupply, the journey has long been far too dangerous and costly to establish any sort of long-term, extensive contact between our two civilisations - but, with the advent of new technologies, and the resources afforded to a united Eordand, this has changed.\n\nMany thought that the "Southern Expedition", a great fleet sent to establish contact with the blue-skinned folk to our south, would be a dismal failure, another sign of the hubris of the Immarellian regime - they were wrong. Instead, the Expedition has been a massive success, returning to Murdkather with crateloads of fine silks, iron and bronze armour, finely cut gems, precious metals and - perhaps more importantly - information. It has become evident that the Cleaved Sea is a region in flux, as power shifts between the Great Kheions and their colonies to the east, and unification of the region, previously unthought of, begins to fill the ambitious hearts of many in the disparate assemblies of the Kheionai. If Gemradcurt is to finally reach out and gain allies in this perilous world, the south may well be the prime candidate for our first step."

For all the things they had heard about the north, them sending a Kheionai envoy was not among them.\n\nOr at least, she looked Kheionai. Her skin was the teal colour of the Kaydano, and as she spoke to the assembly of power and strength and opportunity, she did so in their native tongue. But all could also see that the north had influenced her greatly. Rosanike had once, as an orphan, travelled north with Gemradcurter ships - had been moulded by the customs and norms of that cold, unforgiving place. And she had now returned as the voice of Immarel, the one who had saved her and given her new purpose. But not all assembled saw that as a good thing - and though the alliance was so very close to being voted through, the dissenters and the doubters still had a razor-thin majority. And the people outside, too, were afraid. They had good reason to be.\n\nAmidst her speech, A Caamasi sea-captain, a refugee from his homeland, burst through the chamber's entrance, shrugging off the guards who tried to stop him with the rabid and desperate strength of an exile meeting his exiler. He decried Immarel and the Snecboth and Rosanike as witches, evil-doers and destroyers. He told the assembly, who had half a mind to hear him out, of what the Lady-Mother of Winter had done to his homeland, to all the north. And then, the rage and grief and vengeance overtaking him, he pulled a weapon, cloaked himself in Summer magics, and charged at the diplomat. He barely made it 10 steps before he lay on the floor dead, a storm of fire and ice flash-freezing his flesh and shattering him in the same breadth. Lowering her arm, wisps of magic swirling around her fingertips, she turned back to the assembly.\n\n"What he said was true. All of it." The Kheionai sat in stunned silence as Rosanike resumed her speech, half in awe and half in dread-fear. "But think, all of you, of what the power he spoke of could do in the hands of your city. What I showed you was but a fraction of it, and if a mere diplomat could do this..." She gestured to the ice-burnt corpse behind her. "... then imagine what a hundred of me could do to your enemies. This power - true power - is in your grasp. All you have to do is reach out and take it!""

As she neared the centre of the room, a deep booming voice echoed through the hall.\n\n"Well well well...! If it isn't the Winterswrath, come to see me off at last! Not content with your little hellscape, hmm?" The voice travelled around her, as Immarel struggled to follow it - there were no signs of wing, flame or claw. Where is he? "You are powerful, oh yes... the fey have given you great gifts indeed! And you take those gifts and do what with them? Set yourself up as some kind of god? Was that part of your Archfey's deal? Or was it your doing?"\n\nImmarel kissed her teeth. "I am no god, not like you! And at least I don't spend my days whoring and lazing around! Wasting wealth on frivolities!" She spoke to the whole chamber, trying to find where her foe was hiding. "If you want to accuse me of anything, don't accuse me of giving my people security! Peace! A better life!"\n\n"A better life in bondage... security as fear... a peaceful end, while their corpses are paraded around as tools of your grim desire...!" Immarel finally locked onto the source - it was in front of her, at the foot of the chamber. There was a humanoid figure standing there. An elf, no dragon. "And you have the gall to say you do not waste wealth on "frivolities!" At least I need not murder to have a pretty face...!" Immarel reflexibly raised a hand to her cheek, feeling the warmth of flesh that was not her own.\n\n"From one god to another, Immarel, know this...!" There was a great explosion, as the space around the elf warped beneath the roiling blast of steam and smoke, and Varlengeilt emerged from the debris - he roared as he displayed the majesty of his form, and a jet of flame from his maw set the chamber roof on fire. He clawed his way towards Immarel, breaking columns with his tail and piercing the floor with his claws, propelling himself forwards until at last his maw was mere metres from Immarel's face, the immensity of scale and flesh eclipsing her entirely. "... Know! Your! Place! You may command the deeds of your subjects - by fear or awe - but you will never be able to command their souls! And if you find yourself doing so, then you rule over a kingdom of thralls, not of people! A mother of death, not of winter!" The dragon lifted into the air with a start, the sheer force knocking Immarel to the ground. Then, with the crash of burning and broken stone and wood and metal, he pierced the smouldering roof, jets of flame laying ruin to the stars."

However, this winter was not the absolute force that the Everfrost Prince had once envisioned, nor the instrument of security and control that Immarel had wished for. Though the winter was extended and prolonged, it was necessary that the temperatures lift, and the winter thaw, for a part of the year, so that agriculture could be permitted, and so that Immarel's people would not starve. With the advent of the Hearthwards, which allow year-long agriculture under their aegis, this great flaw has finally been fixed.\n\nThere was no great announcement, no warnings, but everybody noticed as the days grew colder, the snow-cover grew thicker, and as the spring, short as it was, never came. And as the people's sustenance increasingly began to come from shipments from those Hearth-Warded areas, controlled, of course, by the Immarellian regime, and as the propaganda began to proclaim how the "Lady-Mother Provides", all knew who was responsible. But it wasn't like they could do anything - the winds of winter covered the land totally, absolutely. A true eternal winter, for an eternal regime. The Everfrost Prince's dream fulfilled."

She spoke to her assembled troops with passion, telling them of every atrocity committed in the name of the agents of the forest, of Truespear's crimes, and Strutmar's betrayal, and every other injustice that crossed her mind. All listened attentively - though many still had their eyes fixed on the forest wall behind her.\n\nImmarel turned after she finished her speech, towards the Domandrod that arrested the attention of all present. Many people had fled to the Domandrod as Gemradcurt expanded, employed by the Fey as the guard-force of that forsaken place. Once she brought the wards down, they would stream out, spears and bows in hand, and give everything in the defence of their new home - and their ancient masters. And this, she knew, would repeat at every gate that she had stationed her forces, would repeat once they entered the forest, and would repeat in every gladeway and forest clearing they came across. The forest floor would drink the blood of Peitar and Snecboth alike.\n\nBut if that was the price, so be it - Immarel gave the word, and raised her hands, a spell to bring down the wards of the Domandrod at her fingertips."

Immarel zoned out again as the Everfrost Prince's endless rambling continued, and she struggled to walk as she followed him through the blizzard. Soon after they had left the tip of Aerin, he had begun to recite an epic poem that she had never heard before. Three weeks he had recited it, the endless names and dates and battles confusing her long ago, and she had long lost the will to decipher its meaning.\n\n"...but at last blood-crowned Kalrod called for peace. Rock-shaping Finnor he favoured, and he bid all to stand beneath his new stone throne." When Immarel looked up next, her eyes went wide - before her was a tower of rock, piercing the ice like her own Frostspear. "And star-born Kalrod, who had bled and done bleeding for Stel's folk, climbed that tower! And at last he thrust his spear into the rock, Tanalla's streak of silver-white, that had brought frost-doom to so many, and said..." The Prince bade her stay, turning to Immarel and spreading his arms out when he reached the rock-face. "...it is done! The ice shall be our home! The end of our journey has come - for all time, for all age, for all folk, let it be known!" And then the Everfrost Prince disappeared in a bolt of light, and Immarel was alone.\n\nAt the rock face, Immarel found the spear that "Kalrod" had lodged into it. Above, painted in marked detail, was a mural depicting a battle of two humanoids, each with halos of six stars. She stepped up to it, trodding over a mass of fish skulls that had been built up before it, and with a single firm pull seized the white-metal spear. The unblemished shaft was cold to the touch, but the tip nearly froze Immarel's glove when she tried to touch it - a precursor make? Or a design of the fey?\n\nImmarel was awoken from her musings by an ear-splitting screech. She spun around to face the disturbance - a massive Ice Sleeper dragged itself across the snow with its terrible claws, emerging from the storm and snow. Its beady eyes stared deep into her soul, and its lipless mouth hung open, revealing a maw of fangs and teeth. At first, the beast advanced slowly, deliberately - then it charged, screeching again and charging at blinding speed. Immarel raised the spear, and from its tip cast a great shard of ice, rending the beast asunder in a single blow and painting the ice with purplish-red blood and viscera. The spear seemed to double as a spell-focus as well. Immarel smiled."

Various institutions were chafing under the new restrictions placed upon them, to be sure, but she hadn't expected such a wide ranging conspiratorial circle to arise. They did not plan her overthrow, no, but they did engage in every other manner of treason available to them. A cabal of figures from the clergy, nobles, merchant guilds, the Taigan Order and even the Eiganrac, dedicated to skirting government policy, conducting banned or restricted activities, and attempting to gain undue influence over Immarel herself. That last one was especially disconcerting - how far into her inner circle had this group reached?\n\nThe Lady-Mother looked up at the Eiganrac captain who had given her the reports, one Mitarel Sendolm, standing to attention in front of her leader's desk. She was short, and her dyed-red hair cut a dramatic contrast with her snow-white skin. Immarel could see where her nickname, "the Bloody Lady" came from. She had a certain brutality and ruthless efficiency behind her eyes that, though the Lady-Mother tried not to show it, unsettled Immarel. And her record, of course, spoke for itself. "This is concerning, Captain Sendolm. I don't suppose you have any ideas on how to dismantle this force, do you? They are influential - I don't want something like the Red Winter to happen again..."\n\n"With respect, Ma'am, I think that a light touch would bring that closer to reality." Mitarel smirked. "I propose a simpler solution, and one that I think will solve this problem handily. Arrest them all, kill any true traitors and send the rest to the Reotkests." Immarel raised an eyebrow - she had expected it, but did she really think such an open reaction wouldn't inflame tensions? "The longer you let this fester, my Lady, the bigger the problem grows. Why not cut it out at the source?"\n\nImmarel shook her head, looking back at the reports. She knew Mitarel's words had some truth to it - and Immarel did have far more control now than she did back then. At last, she gave in, filing the papers away. "Alright, Captain. I'm giving you free reign over this. Do not disappoint me."\n\nMitarel's smirk turned into a full smile. "I will make sure I don't, my Lady.

No Peitar or fey to be found. Eventually, she came across a small spring, the water frozen over, the ice possessing a mirror sheen. When she peered within, she found herself no longer alone - an enchantingly beautiful woman, draped in vines and with a crown of rose-thorns, stood behind her in the reflection. Her face was locked in a grimace, eyes blazing with rage. Immarel spun around, but instead of the woman she found a hulking beast, with a mask of writhing antlers. She turned back to the pool, as the woman and beast spoke amidst a thousand voices, the trees and leaves and spring and ground chanting, venom on their lips and on the wind.\n\n "You destroyer!" "You devourer!" "You are no elf, but a herald of ruin!" "A puppet!" "A monster!" Immarel flicked her hand up at the pool, her anger flashing, and a spell-blast shattered the mirror-surface - but the voices continued, projected from the woman who now occupied every remnant shard of ice. "The Prince of Frost pulls the strings and you dance!" "You break my kin, smother your history!" "You scour the land by your grim advance!" Immarel spun to face the antlered fey as the voices attacked her, raising a hand again and firing away, a cataclysmic blast of cold fire laying waste to all in front of her, scorching the very earth - but from the ashes of her attack rose into the sky a thousand wasps and flies and grim-flying-things, all of whom, each in sharp distinction, joined their voices to the brilliant chorus. "Eternity is a fool's game - we await your fall with bated breath!" "A curse on you, O' "Mistress of the Domandrod!" "Lady of Winter!" "You are nothing but a Mother of Death!" As a million daggers of tongue and truth danced and carved blood-words into her mind, the ruler of the north fell to her knees, clutching her head and crying out in terror and pain and grief and regret and cruel-knowing. And then, all at once, the voices ceased, and the forest was at peace.\n\nFor hours, Immarel knelt on the ground, arms out to stop herself from collapsing, head downcast, as the ruin of her madness scorched the forest around her. Tears and sweat wet her face as she breathed hard, shaking uncontrollably, the terror lingering beyond the ordeal's end. Her eyes were locked wide, pupils constricted to pin-pricks. It would be a full day before she returned to her people, a pale look on her face, and fear and discontent simmering in her eyes. From that day forward, there were no more Peitar raids or fey-borne calamities in the Domandrod - but Immarel never forgot the fear, the voices, the pain.

The Reokest withers your body... the cold assaults you everyday, when you sleep or work. Food and water are often stale or unclean, and whatever they give you is just enough to keep you working, and nothing more - not as if they need you to work, of course! Much of what they set us to do could easily be done by the undead - especially considering the ample supply of corpses this grim place produces.\n\nWhat they do to your spirit is worse - far worse if you are a political prisoner.

For a while now he had led a spirited resistance, Dracball claiming the lives of many soldiers, but finally he had been tracked down to this town on the river's edge - all they had to do was find him, and Immarel would blast him and his accursed sword to nothing.

It seemed like every rebel knight in Arganjuzorn burst from Krantisor's houses and cellars. Immarel and her bodyguards were immediately set upon, many falling as they were cut down by Juzornic steel, and as fire and ice engulfed the buildings of the streets, and scorched the pavement stones beneath their feet. Immarel was busy barking orders, providing magic support where it was most desperately needed - too busy to spot the approaching tide of blood and destruction barreling towards her.\n\nWhen a bodyguard frantically demanded her attention, and she finally turned around to see the disturbance, the Lady-Mother's eyes went wide. Artorean was surging forward, flashes of precursor steel rending flesh and bone as he cut his way straight towards Immarel with blinding speed and impossible ferocity. Spiral-shards of ice blasted the ground where her foe stood, but he was too fast, dodged the attack, and within a moment he was upon her. The guard who had struck her surged forward, but he was cut down near-instantly - Immarel stepped back as he raised Dracball, but she was too late, and it's edge severed her right arm clean off, pain lancing through her body. She gritted her teeth, raised her left instead as she took another step back, and fired off a desperate volley. She caught Artorean in the middle of his torso with an ice-shard, ripping a great hole through his body and sending guts and viscera onto the street behind him, but the last Uma-Zomaj moved like a man possessed. As the walking-corpse raised his sword once again, ready to strike a fatal blow as his eyes burned with rage and bloody-vengeance, Immarel fired again, and there was no longer any corpse left to do so.\n\nAs the battle still raged around her, Immarel seized Dracball, holding it up to the sky as blood dripped from the remains of her right arm. She held it high, so that all could see, and then surged magic through it with a cry.

Two years - it had been two entire years since that fateful night, when Immarel had abandoned herself to a project that, in truth, she saw no way of completing. She had tried everything. Everything! And still she failed again and again and again! She had restarted the project and revised her notes and tried every configuration and layout imaginable, and it had all been for naught. Now she just sat in the testing chamber and wept. She had sunk so much time into this, so much energy. She just wanted it to work. Again, that dreaded word "Why?" repeated in her head.\n\nFirst she thought it was the fey - those blasted hellspawn that had jumped her in the Domandrod. Those two - or however many of them were actually there in the clearing - had royally screwed her over, and finally that curse of theirs was coming true. Then it was the dragon. Varlengeilt! What a stupid name... who names their child Varlengeilt? Immarel wouldn't know, but also, she didn't care. Then she thought it was herself. She was, after all, a stupid, stupid, stupid, no-good mother-of-death foolish idiot, and she couldn't do anything, let alone make a skeleton shiny. She was a fool to think this could work, a fool! Immarel let out a pained groan as she downed another shot of whiskey.\n\nBut it wasn't her, was it...? She knew it wasn't. Knew it wasn't the fey (why would they care?), knew it wasn't old Varlengielt (was he even still alive?), and she knew it wasn't herself - because it WAS right. The circle, the theory, the magic, the materials, it was all right! It just wasn't working! She thought it was all those things, but she knew it was something else entirely. She was just too damn proud to admit it. "I'm sorry... is that what you want...? I'm sorry, my Prince... I just wanted to make something cool... it was going to be so beautiful...!" Immarel muttered the words through her drunken sobs, as she finally gave up, and fell asleep.\n\nBut then something woke her up - a cold hand on her shoulder. She turned around with a start - expecting to see her patron gloating over her shoulder at her failure. But instead she saw a skeleton. A metal skeleton. HER metal skeleton - head cocked to the side and with a curious look behind the glowing blue dots in it's eye sockets. Immarel's eyes lit up - then, still very drunk, she jumped up and embraced the skeleton, hugging it and jumping up and down with joy, endless words of thanks on her lips."

A young man - a boy, really - withdrew his sword from the plated visor of a rebellious Ynnic knight, wiping the blood off the blade and then stabbing it into the ground. As his leader approached, the boy flicked his dark black hair out of his eyes, turned to her, and performed a crisp salute. "All hostiles eliminated, ma'am."\n\n"At ease, Captain - you did good work here." The young captain nodded and complied, as she looked him up and down - barely a scratch on him. The boy, who was known to all only as the Balladeer, for the stories that were sung within the Eiganrac of his fame, was the youngest ever Captain of the Eiganrac. He had learnt to hold a sword at 9, to kill at 13, and by his promotion last year, at 15, he had already proved himself many times over. "Another successful mission." Immarel smiled as she spoke. "Your legend grows by the day, Captain - it won't be long until everyone in Gemradcurt knows your... ah..."\n\nThe Balladeer turned away, looking around the devastated town as Immarel blushed from her mistake - eventually, his eyes fixed on a burning house, collapsing under the weight of the flames. "It's alright - I don't really care about names, my Lady. All I need is to fight for you." Immarel winced as she realised what he was about to say. She had heard this before - many times before - but she knew how much the words meant to the boy. "When my real mother abandoned me, you saved me - took me in. I'll never forget that." He turned back to Immarel. "You're immortal. You won't die... won't leave. So I'll serve you, name or no name, for as long as I can. That's all I live for."\n\nImmarel simply gave a curt nod, then turned and walked back to her elk without another word. She noticed tears welling in her eyes, and reached up with fingers that were not her own to wipe them away. She couldn't bare to tell him the truth - that his mother, a young woman of great magical ability and a striking physical resemblance to Immarel's original body, had been selected by her as a replacement body. She was reminded of Varlengeilt's words - his mother had not abandoned him, she had been murdered so that Immarel could keep a warm body and a pretty face. Immarel had done all she could for the boy - given him the best training, fast-tracked him through the Eiganrac, cultivated his immense skills and abilities - but even now, she felt it all so little. Immarel's face was downcast as she mounted her white-elk. As she left, she looked back to the town, muttering under breath choked with tears."

One or two of them have collapsed under the weight of the snow, or from the rot that has infested many of the logs that keep them standing. Immarel could barely recognise the place, even though, centuries ago, in that hut, right over there, she had been born. Her family were sedentary - a rarity back then, especially in Gemradcurt, but ever more common once the Hibernal Crusade started. Now nearly all Snecboth lived like Immarel's family had. She had made sure of it.\n\nImmarel struggled through the snow, her footsteps heavy, until at last she came to her old home. As she entered, she could practically hear the sound of her parents chatting away. They loved to talk, often about the most random things - and about how proud they were of her. Of how great she was, of how powerful she'd be one day. Her mother's gentle smile, her father's beaming eyes - she remembered when the Taigan Order first found her... the last time she saw them alive. They'd both been killed by the Tuathak. And now her home was gone too... the town had been abandoned during the Hibernal Crusade, but it looked like it had at one point been reconverted to a hideout by Snecboth Guerillas. Weapons and armour were discarded around the room, most rusted beyond use, her old ornate furniture replaced with military equipment. On the wall there was a message, written in red... not blood, but paint. "Resist!" It said.\n\nImmarel wished, hoped beyond hope... no, this wasn't from the Hibernal Crusade. This was from the Red Winter. She placed a hand to the paint... breathed hard, and hung her head. Another victim of her ambition... her pride. She wondered if, had she not taken the Prince's offer, this town in the middle of nowhere would still be alive? Or if it'd just be another Tuathak military camp, or if it'd be blasted ash...\n\nA voice awoke Immarel from her musings. "I thought you'd be here." Immarel turned to her benefactor, standing in the doorway behind her. "I had something I needed to tell you... but if you need time..." The Lady-Mother shook her head, forcing a smile. "... then in that case, I'd like to tell you this. Our pact is fulfilled." Immarel raised an eyebrow, shocked. "You have crafted a winter eternal - a realm in which the snow always covers the ground, in which all may feel the embrace of cold... there is nothing more I can ask of you. Well done." The Archfey smiled. "If you ever need me, just call out, and I will be there. Farewell, my friend." And with that, the Everfrost Prince turned, and walked away.

She had wondered - and wondered still - whether that future had been avoided by her taking the Prince's hand. She remembered what the dragon told her in Svemel, about her becoming a god. He was right. Her influence reached every house and person in the nation, from Arakeprun to Daleigchos... a portrait in every home, an informant on every street. The Snecboth did not used to have gods. They did not used to live in one place. They did not used to control Arakeprun or Daleigchos. She had changed all that, brought unparalleled success to her people. And changed them. Changed every bit of them. Changed even the very land itself. She stood now in her office at the tip of a spire of metal and glass and ice and timber, and looked through a crystal-clear window, her gaze falling across a land cast forever in snow. Was it so implausible that she could command her people's souls, without ruling over a realm of the dead? Was that within her power too?\n\nImmarel shook her head. A mother of death... that was what she had sought to avoid all those years ago, she remembered that much. She had made an oath. But since then it seemed that all people did was accuse her of being one. And they were right. She was the mother of death... she had brought death and ruin and destruction to her own people and others. She had cleaved her nation clean in two during the Red Winter, crushed the nations of the south and the east, and worst of all, she had killed completely the old Snecboth way of life. That last part weighed on her the most. How couldn't it? She had murdered the very thing she swore to protect.\n\nBut had she not replaced it with something... better? She had, undoubtedly so, brought peace, prosperity and security to her nation, to all her subjects. There would never be another Hibernal Crusade - another Red Winter. No Snecboth child would be made an orphan by a marauding band of Autumnal soldiers. And if they were made an orphan by Immarel's hand, by necessary action... couldn't she do something about that? Take them in? Give them new purpose, like the Balladeer? Couldn't she help them where they needed it? Propel her people to greater heights still? Immarel knew one thing - as long as she stood, she would never again let inaction imperil the people of the north. Never again. And let that be the new oath of the Winterswrath! Forever and forever, she would stand. And forever and forever, she would rule. And protect. And keep watch over this thing that so many had shed blood to build.

Would she feel the same thing tomorrow? Would this ritual strip her even of that? Immarel thought these things, but beneath them, a different worry turned over and over again. Last night she had dreamed she had climbed to the tip of the Frostspear, a swirling maelstrom of snow and magic above her, and for miles and miles she had seen the destruction of man... The buildings of Gemradcurt lie ruined, wood and stone husks were all that remained of the city's vitality; Snecboth bodies littered the streets. Riders ran roughshod through them, hunting down any elf still living. Outside the city, thousands or tens of thousands laid dead. Death wrote its name in bloody characters across the snow.\n\nImmarel had awoken with tears in her eyes. Grief-stricken, though the events she had seen had not yet come to pass. She was blinded by her fear then, but now she could see two possibilities before her. In one, that grim day was the result of inaction. A future where she threw off this new power out of worry, and Gemradcurt was finally overrun by its enemies. By the realms of the south perhaps, or strange invaders from the sea. The other... that terrible other... was that her action would be the harbinger of catastrophe. That she would be the mother of death, and from her womb would spring calamity unrivalled by all others. That her hubris, her clamour for ever more power, would undo everything that had been won by the blood of hundreds of thousands of her countrymen.\n\nImmarel sat motionless on the chair, thinking and thinking and thinking. Her skin grew uncomfortably hot under the fire, but she didn't care - didn't pull away her hand. She had the choice... The ritual was ready, and it would begin tomorrow night. All she had to do was give the word and it would be cast aside. Or she could go to sleep now, and go to her destiny. A coin flip that would decide the fate of her nation."

Her quest for personal power had nearly made her a slave of the fey, but no longer - if she wants to lead her people to glory, she must do so alone, under her own power.

There was a clamour around her as soldiers and merchantmen and nobles rushed to barricade doors, sharpen their weapons, and plan their next move. Her wrists and ankles were bound, and someone had put a gag in her mouth. She was still wearing the white nightgown she wore to bed. She looked around. In the heart chamber, heavily armed, stood a large part of the cream of Gemradcurt's society. They had figured out her plan, were spooked, and staged a coup. Just what Immarel needed... Near one of the chamber doors stood Captain Serondar and a few very prominent nobles - they were arguing about what to do next. Judging by the mention of his name, the faint shouting and noise from the other side of the chamber doors, and the incessant thud of battering rams striking them, Captain Talaran was on the other side, trying to get in. At least someone had stayed loyal. It didn't matter, though - Talaran wasn't getting in, and she wasn't getting out. The binds were so tight they bit into her skin, and she could barely move her fingers - no casting spells.\n\nThen time stopped. An Archfey, the most beautiful elf Immarel had ever seen, clad in white furs and armour, apparated from thin air and approached, crouching down before her. "The Long Night has come. Now is the time that the wheat separates from the chaff, and those who are on the side of winter reveal themselves." Immarel's binds suddenly broke free, movement restored to her even as everyone else in the room stood dead-still. She pulled the gag from her mouth, and the Everfrost Prince continued. "I propose a pact, at this darkest hour. I grant you power - eternal life, and magical abilities beyond compare. And in return, you shall cast the land into an eternal winter, so that the snow shall fall for half the year, and so that all may feel the icy embrace of winter." He offered his hand.

Immarel stood within the chamber, the inside of the phylactery behind her swirling with magical energy, wisps of it filling the chamber and spreading out once the doors opened. She stood tall, nearly majestic in her power, and completely at ease, despite her injuries, standing in the biting cold in nothing but a tattered nightgown - all the plotters and traitors were dead on the floor, reduced to frozen corpses. With a flick of her hand, they rose once again in service to her. The Taigan Order loyalists, Talaran included, knelt in submission to her - but they had no idea what had truly transpired; What Immarel had become; What would soon happen to Gemradcurt.\n\nAlong with the rest of the nation, they soon would. From the tip of the Frostspear, coinciding with the explosion within its depths, erupted a beam of light that seemed to pierce the sky, a maelstrom of ice and wind and magic erupting over the skies of the city. Across northern Eordand, from Slecgal to Marathmas to Einsagg, the days kept growing colder and colder and colder, until the entire nation was plunged into a deep winter. Snow fell. Then armies marched from the Frostspear - armies of undead, of frozen corpses and ice-white skeletons, led by Taigan Order officers. And, finally, Immarel told the people what had occurred.\n\nThere had been a grave threat to Gemradcurt - a coup attempt from within, supported by enemies from without. Immarel was forced to take drastic measures. This new winter, a near-eternal winter that would last 9 months of the year, alongside the undead armies streaming out of Gemradcurt, would protect them forever - as would Immarel.

Hastily thrown together over the course of a week, it was comprised of notable nobles, merchantmen, clergy, and even Taigan Order soldiers, be they followers of Ishera (who did not know of the attempt) or previously devout supporters of Immarel such as the late Captain Serondar. And so, the deaths of those conspirators naturally raised the anger of much of Gemradcurt's establishment. A confrontation - unrest - was likely. But Immarel had not expected this.\n\nIt began as demonstrations. Disobedience. It soon turned into small-scale raids, ambushes on Taigan Order soldiers and undead patrols. Then everything collapsed, all at once. Entire provinces began to openly reject Immarel's rule. Armouries were looted, and the majority of regular Snecboth soldiers deserted or mutinied. A great part of the people of Gemradcurt had risen up in fear and anger at Immarel's seizure of power, and her use of necromancy, long thought a distasteful but necessary weapon of war, had been unmasked for what they now saw it to truly be - an evil art, designed only to increase Immarel's personal power and unleash unrivalled tyranny on the Snecboth people.\n\nBut Immarel was not alone - the greater part of the Taigan Order remained fanatically loyal. Many clergy, merchants and nobles chose to support her either out of fear or simply to hedge their bets on the side they thought would win. But despite many ordinary peoples’ shock and anger, perhaps four-tenths of the Snecboth population could not separate Immarel the liberator, the victorious conqueror and defender, from whatever they said she was now. The revelation that the Everfrost Prince, an Archfey of legend, had been helping Immarel gave even more legitimacy to her cause. By the end of the month, the hoped-for mass overthrow of Immarel had not materialised - instead, the lines of a true civil war, family against family and friend against friend, had been drawn.

Though she did not have the years or experience of some of her older advisors, Immarel trusted none more than Ishera when it came to good, sound counsel. They knew each other well, and they had fought side by side on many occasions. When it came to personal matters, not matters of state or warfare or whatever else concerned government, Ishera was the only person whom Immarel could turn to. But one of them had changed. Either Ishera grew too soft, or Immarel grew too wrathful, too hungry for power and security and eternal peace. By the time the Long Night came, there was this rift between them, indistinct but ever-present. In the days after her ascension, Immarel had hoped, foolishly, that Ishera might understand what she had done; Might play the friend and confidant in the undoubtedly tough time ahead.\n\nBut she was wrong. Of course she was - it was folly to hope for any other outcome. Soon after the Red Winter began in earnest, Ishera publicly and ostentatiously defected to the rebels. She denounced Immarel as a traitor to the people of Gemradcurt, to the old ways and to the Winter Court. Quickly, she emerged as a key figure in the resistance, and soon enough, she had been appointed as the leader of a force that would strike down her old comrade. They call themselves "The Watchers of the White", claiming to represent the true, legitimate government of Gemradcurt, and are comprised largely of the nation's prominent rebellious nobility and mercantile class, many of whom had lost friends and family in the chaos of the Long Night.

All across the Tuathak-majority territories in the west, Autumn Court fanatics and Tuathak separatists have risen in revolt, slaughtering any Snecboth they can find and reimposing the worship of Autumn throughout their controlled territories. While most of these revolts are localised, in Raithtall a far more serious threat has arisen.\n\nIt seems that after the defeat of Raithtall by Immarel and Gemradcurt, the son of its last ruler, one Galhan Oakgardner, fled to the Golden Acres of Dorcurt, alongside a large population of loyalists. Dispersing into the local population, who were supportive of Galhan and his men in the face of Snecboth tyranny, they hid there for many years, waiting for the perfect moment to strike and reclaim their home - and that time is now.

While Taigan Order soldiers everywhere have risen to the task of weeding out traitors in the many towns and villages of the north, it was in fact a different force who have proved best.\n\nComprised of ordinary Snecboth, who have joined Immarel's side in the Red Winter out of duty or loyalty or whatever else motivates them, these mounted warriors, who call themselves the Eiganrac, and bare an insignia of a white snowflake on a bloody field, have proven their worth countless times, reducing many regions of the country to submission through sheer, efficient brutality. They have been at the forefront of what the enemy call "the White Terror", a campaign of "militia actions" that have resulted in the deaths of many civilians, but have also been vital in securing the regime's survival.\n\nIf we are to see the end of this civil war, this force must be organised and subsumed under the direct control of the Taigan Order, so that we may employ them in even greater strength and numbers, and quickly reduce this realm to order."

 flavor_gemradcurt.108.d:0 "As one by one rebellious factions were dispersed or destroyed, many thought that this bloody phase of the Red Winter was finally drawing to a close, and that soon enough Immarel would rule uncontested over Eordand's north. With the news that Jahainar Truespear has recently emerged from the Domandrod with a force of thousands of Strutmari and Tuathak refugees and emigres, Gladewardens, and disparate groups of Snecboth rebels, all of those hopes (and fears) have been shattered.\n\nA powerful mage from Trimgarb, Truespear appears to have been granted passage through the Domandrod in a similar fashion to that army of Iadth that once crushed the Autumnal realm of Dorcurt, his army emerging from the Winter Gate at Dungat and headed straight for the city of Gemradcurt - it is clear that if Immarel does not deal with this new threat with haste, all she has worked for may unravel before her."

 flavor_gemradcurt.109.d:0 "Truespear's invasion of Gemradcurt represented a crisis-point for the Immarellian regime. Many within the resistance hoped that it would be the final blow that would topple the rule of the hated necromancer-queen, and that the civil war that had torn apart their home would end in their favour. But as Truespear was slain and his army was shattered on the approach to Gemradcurt, those hopes melted away. Now, it seems only a matter of time before Immarel achieves her final victory.\n\nBut for the regime, the destruction of Truespear's army nonetheless presents an interesting question.\n\nThough Tuathak and Snecboth rebels also contributed to his force, the majority of his followers were Peitar, be they Strutmari refugees who had fled to the Domandrod or other Peitar states, adventurers from Pelomar or Trimgarb, or Gladewardens donated to the effort by the Fey, abandoning their usual posts in an extraordinary effort to destroy the most existential threat to balance ever seen in the region. While many in the regime wish for the Peitar to be punished for their transgressions, there are still those who argue that there is no need to waste resources persecuting a people who could be more easily brought to heel by other methods - no matter the answer, it will undoubtedly set a precedent for how we handle the Peitar in the future. The choice, like everything else in the north, is now in Immarel's hands."

Many push aside their doubts, and redouble their efforts in ending the civil war. In the case of our recently departed advisor, the opposite occurs. Taking with them a significant amount of state resources, they have turned traitor and joined with those wishing to depose Immarel."

 flavor_gemradcurt.111.d:0 "The civil war has been bloody and destructive beyond measure - entire regions of the nation lie in ruins, scourged by rebel and loyalist alike. While the normal process of rooting out entrenched guerrillas or striking out at Immarellian garrisons is responsible for much of this devastation, it is undeniable that the methods of the "Eiganrac", fanatic elven volunteers who have taken Immarel's side during the civil war, have been instrumental in reducing much of the nation to tranquil ashes, charred and frostbitten corpses staining the snow red. [scourged_province_target.GetName] has been the latest victim of the Eiganrac's "White Terror" - much of the population has been slaughtered, and any rebels in the province frozen out of their hideaways."

Families and communities were divided, as many took arms against their kin, in defence of principles or liberties they would gladly die for. While the ever-deepening intensity of the civil war dragged the populace into a corresponding polarisation and radicalisation, the actions of the Immarellian regime have nonetheless been instrumental in driving both supporters and neutrals alike into arms against it. The latest case of this phenomenon has been in [resist_province_target.GetName], where the local population has risen in revolt against Immarel, refusing to acknowledge her agents or her rule."

 flavor_gemradcurt.113.d:0 "The Hibernal Crusade was devastating for the Snecboth. Thousands were killed or driven away from their ancestral homes and territories, as Tuathak crusaders marched north in hope of conquering the Winter once and for all. While this was undoubtedly a horrific time for the north, it had some silver lining: the Snecboth now have perhaps the greatest experience in guerrilla and irregular warfare on the continent. The Red Winter has proven this many times over. From the day wights and undead soldiers began to stream out of the Frostspear, they and their Order-Knight puppet masters have come under relentless attack from rebel fighters. While primarily this has been a costly but drawn-out process of attrition, every so often the guerrillas achieve an astounding victory. Unfortunately, this has recently been the case, as a Taigan Order force was destroyed to a man by a surgical attack by an irregular rebel militia. With their wights and skeletal soldiers collapsing to dust or going beserk without their masters, the entire army is lost to us, and it will likely be costly to replace them."

 flavor_gemradcurt.114.d:0 "Many expected the civil war to end with a bang - really, many expected that the destruction of Truespear's army would signal the near-instant collapse of a faltering rebel effort. They were wrong. Even after Truespear and his Peitar, Tuathak and Snecboth force lied dead on the fields outside Gemradcurt, rebels continued their guerrilla and irregular attacks on Taigan Order forces, and rebel armies continued to near-spontaneously rise against Immarel's tyrannical reign. Instead of a quick victory, the devastating civil war that tore apart Gemradcurt for years ended not with a bang, but with a whimper. As the months passed, rebel strongholds were broken, tax revenues increased, disobedience of agents of the state and Taigan Order-Knights alike declined, and the massive amounts of undead soldiers raised for the defence of the regime began to be penned off or disposed of, no longer necessary for the new Gemradcurt, where Immarel reigns absolutely supreme. Finally, mercifully, the Red Winter is over."
