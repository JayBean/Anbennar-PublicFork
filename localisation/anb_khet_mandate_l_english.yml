 establish_ahati_reform_desc:0 "The Ahati, composed of powerful military brotherhoods in the north, and influential merchant-warrior brotherhoods in the south, are often considered upholders of the mandate. Due to this their influence reaches all across the Mother's Sorrow; so much so that both they and a common citizen will consider them equal to nobility. Upholding virtue, justice, and proper rule, they will be vigilant enforcers of our whim and that of the Khets. On the other hand should we demonstrate ourselves to be unfit for the throne, it will be neither their first nor last regicide."

 lessons_aakhet_reform_desc:0 "Aakhet the Bronze: Where he walked, the earth trembled both from his footsteps alone, and multiplied by the legions behind him. Spending much of his time living in human form as we mortals do, he led Kheteratan armies to Bulwar and expanded the borders of the Khet as far as Azka-szel-Azka under his command. By emulating warriors of old, those who served the great dragon, we can make legionaries out of our regiments. May Aakhet guide their blades."

 lessons_dameria_reform_desc:0 "When one speaks of the empires of antiquity, one that often shines above the rest is the Damerian Republic, and for good reason. This massive empire stretched across the Dameshead, even controlling the Mother's Sorrow. Since then, we've assimilated and mastered their ability to administer large swaths of land. Now our government works better than ever, from the state to local level. Every corner of our empire will feel the blessing of the Mandate."

 unite_brotherhoods_reform_desc:0 "Since the time of Aakhet, the brotherhoods of the Ahati have been divided into the northern and southern brotherhoods. While the warriors of the north have served us well, and the merchants of Irsmahap, or the southern Sorrow, have too, the division of the two has too long been a strain on our administration. Rather than having to appease one or the other, we can simply unite them once more and let the Mandate, and its enforcers, stand in unity."

We can take these bronze destroyers and take them to the next level, by putting powder in the barrel so that when the cannonball fires it appears as if it was done so by a dragon. Creating large billows of smoke and a blazing cannonball, this will be a fearsome tool in war."

 establish_medasi_reform_desc:0 "The influence of the Khet has always reached far from the Mother's Sorrow, even if they are constrained to its beautiful shores. As our borders too expand, this develops an increasing strain on the part of our administration that is directly under the Khet. Established to expand the Kheteratan hold on the continent, such as Horashesh in the past, the Medasi will serve us faithfully.

Given that they often border more powerful entities, it seems only right that they should be given what they need to raise sufficient banners to pose a threat to outside nations. The Medasi Legions will be second only to our own."

As such, our control of the Mother's Sorrow has also fortified our authority over our Medasis and it only stands to reason then that they should rely on us more as we rely on them. By restricting foreign trade from their borders, and some of our own, we can solidify this relationship while expanding all markets under our influence. A market for the Khet, under the Khet."

The Steward of the Sorrow should then too be able to wield such a mighty tool, and luckily the Khet have seen it the same way.

Even so, one must appreciate its beauty from time to time; that beautiful danger. To a Khet of course, it's merely beauty. To them, a damestear shower is a matter of will and not luck.

We can reduce these unfortunate incidents to the minimum by assigning them permanent supervisors, placing loyalists in key positions of their governments and ensuring any dissidents are swiftly dealt with.

These cat-headed beings are as fickle and hedonistic as they are powerful, however, and if the state is not able to provide for their whims and desires, we run the risk of suffering the same fate as our predecessor, replaced by the next ambitious conqueror that shows up at our doorstep. Because of this we will dedicate a section of our administration to ensure they are properly pampered, and in return they will officially support our state, facilitating the establishment of full control over the area and even lending us their godlike powers in moments of need. Our relationship with the Khet promises to be one of great mutual benefit, as long as we keep the pleasure barges moving through the river."
 khet_mandate.01.a:0 "I hope they do not become too debauched."

 khet_mandate.50.t:0 "Lessons from the Wise"
 khet_mandate.50.d:0 " For some time our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] was exhibiting shameful conduct, and many in the court were worried about the effects this could have in the state after [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] ascension to the throne. Recently, however, [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] behavior has improved significantly, and surprisingly the one responsible for this change is no other than a Khet infamous for sharing our heir's flaw and carrying it to extreme degrees. Apparently he approached [Root.Heir.GetName] in private and convinced [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to change [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] conduct. He explained that while in a Khet like himself such behavior is tolerated, that is only because of the divine blood flowing through their veins and the amazing powers they can use to favor the realm as compensation. Mortals, on the other hand, have both the duty of living a virtuous life and the privilege of having wills strong enough to do so, as most of the Khet simply are unable to overcome the decadent tendencies that come with their nature."
 khet_mandate.50.a:0 "Do as they say, not as they do."

 khet_mandate.51.t:0 "Day of the Khet"
 khet_mandate.51.d:0 "When we established the Day of the Khet as an official holiday, we sought to allow our people to experience just once a year the great pleasure and celebration that is everyday life for the Khet. Great festivals are celebrated in every part of our realm, during which an immense quantity and variety of luxuries and diversions are available to everyone, from the poorest of the beggars to the divine Khetarch himself. This year the celebrations have been particularly magnificent, which has resulted in some additional benefits for the state."
 khet_mandate.51.a:0 "I wish we could do this everyday."

 khet_mandate.52.t:0 "Pleasure Barge on the Move"
 khet_mandate.52.d:0 "The Khet spend the majority of their time aboard their Pleasure Barges, great moving temples of luxury and debauchery that slowly move through the Mother's Sorrow. In these barges the Khet are pampered by hundreds of servants and given access to the most luxurious and exotic goods available. It is in the state's best interest that nothing interrupts the pleasures of the Khet or the movement of their barges, but sometimes this requires steep sacrifices. It's unclear what happened this time; perhaps something offended a Khet, causing them to retaliate with terrible magic, or else it was necessary to strip the land of valuable resources or to conscript the locals as servants to satisfy the whims of the cat-headed beings. Maybe it was all just an unfortunate accident. Whatever it was, the province through which the barge passed has suffered greatly, and now it falls to us to mend this damage while the Khet continue their journey down the river."
 khet_mandate.52.d2:0 "In the past the arrival of a Pleasure Barge was a cause of panic for those living on the shores of the Sorrow, as the Khet's whim could mean ruin and suffering. Our new barges, more luxurious and splendorous but less frequent, do not elicit this feeling anymore, and now the barges are received with merriment and celebration when they pass by a population center. This has made the Khet feel more loved than ever before, and their enjoyment of the pleasures of the barges has increased now that they are greater but more infrequent. Recently a great party was organized by local authorities to celebrate the passing of a barge, and the Khet were happy to participate and accept the honors and gifts the locals offered them, after which they publicly announced their satisfaction with our administration."

 khet_mandate.62.d:0 "A word has caught the Steward's ear about another Khet feat in the country. It seems the Khet has caused a flood on plantations producing his favourite commodity, causing a boom of this good's production. The farmers appreciate the boons provided by the Khet, as they both appreciate the symbiotic relationship they found themselves in, where one gives fertile land and the other gives fresh produce."

 khet_mandate.63.t:0 "Harsh Demands"
 khet_mandate.63.d:0 "Sometimes, the Steward of the Sorrow can be overwhelmed with the sheer amount of work that is needed to be done at once. For example, a Khet's thirst for Lorentish wine has been a thing long neglected by the Khetarch, as there were more urgent and mischievous Khets to worry about. Now, he's had enough and the price for it is a blotted sun, causing widespread panic among pretty much everyone in Kheterata apart from the Khets."

 khet_mandate.64.t:0 "An Expensive Nap"
 khet_mandate.64.d:0 "One may attribute different adjectives to the race of Khets: moody, mischievous, persistent, lazy. Those would not be the words used by the Khet worshippers, who happened to revere one who has been sleeping for a month in the province of [event_province.GetName]. He positioned himself on a rocky bed of an important trade route leading there and his existence there happened to flock in zealous worshippers of Khet. This amassing of people is blocking the land trade in the province as we speak and merchants would like the Steward to fix it."

 khet_mandate.65.t:0 "A Rude Sandstorm"

Unfortunately for him, a notable landowner has knocked over Khet's luggage, causing it to sink in the waters of Sorrow. Least to say, the next day the landowner's residence and its vicinity were met by a huge sandstorm which did not move away from the place it was summoned upon. The Khet is now contemptuous with his retaliation and watches as his creation swirls parts of debris in random directions."
 khet_mandate.65.a:0 "You've got your revenge, please stop now"
 khet_mandate.65.b:0 "I think I've heard this one before"

 khet_mandate.66.t:0 "Khet's Delight"
 khet_mandate.66.d:0 "The Khetarch most times is the eldest of the Khets, the one to stand above them as the head of their community. This position in theory bears great responsibilities, but unfortunately in practice most of them are still a specimen of lazy and indifferent species, causing them to drop most of these into mortal appointees like Steward of the Sorrow. In the newest batch of requirements, there is a request from a Khet to get a personal ship and its crew from the navy. It would act as his pleasure barge, shooting cannonballs into the waters to gather fish and giving him the aesthetic he needs."

He tried to seek an escape route for him and his sheep, but he was forced to make a choice: leave the sheep or die with them. He made a dire choice and he stayed alive. On his way out, already mourning his companions, he unexpectedly discovered a deposit of rare metals. Content with his consolation, he thanked the Khets and reported his findings to the authorities."

Their emissaries' newest addition to the tribute were young lizardwomen servants. Unluckily, their beauty did not appease the Khets as they did not appreciate their beauty.

It has been presented to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in an extensive document beautifully crafted by the best gnomish scribes of Kheterata. Its main point is the concession of major political and economical autonomy to Koroshesh, which would henceforth be ruled by the Korosheshi League, a council composed of representatives from the aforementioned groups.

That confidence turned into hubris, and they failed to consider the risks of their own ventures. Recently, they experienced a series of catastrophic failures in major enterprises, and with most of their capital invested in different projects they did not have the funds or liquidity to react, resulting in their collapse and ruin.\n\nFixing this mess will undoubtedly cost us plenty of time, effort and money, especially if we want to try and save the League and their investments. We have ample justification to dismantle them and revoke their privileges and autonomy after this failure. On the other hand, they have already proven that they can be extremely useful, so we could rescue them and allow their continued operation with new leadership and increased supervision.\n\nSome of the boldest members of the League propose a more radical option. They argue that the only thing this fiasco proves is that the League did not have enough resources.

He is, however, having a hard time finding a customer able and willing to pay the gigantic sum of money he demands as compensation for his years of labor and centuries of experience.\n\nOur contacts in [event_country.GetName] have informed us of an amazingly wealthy state mage living there, who could be interested in purchasing the gem. We could put the artisan and the wizard in contact in exchange for a share of the sell profits. However, mages are an odd bunch, and we can not guarantee he will be interested. Perhaps we should invest a bit into convincing him to secure the purchase."
 khet_mandate.212.a:0 "Send our finest negotiators and shower him with gifts."
 khet_mandate.212.b:0 "I am sure the artisan will manage to convince him."

 khet_mandate.213.t:0 "Wealthy Gnomes"
 khet_mandate.213.d:0 "The Delta Gnomes communities of Koroshesh have experienced a significant increase in prosperity since we granted the region autonomy. Many have made a fortune by trading or crafting, and the already wealthy families have managed to expand their businesses significantly. Many of these gnomes have decided to spend part of this capital into organising festivals and charity works in their cities, as a way to show their love and gratitude to the people of Koroshesh. While this is of course great, some of our advisors are suggesting that we pressure the gnomes into reinvesting their capital in a more productive way."
 khet_mandate.213.a:0 "We should not interfere with their generosity."
 khet_mandate.213.b:0 "Convince them to reinvest."

 khet_mandate.214.t:0 "Trade Secrets"
 khet_mandate.214.d:0 "Merchants ruthlessly compete with one another to maximise their profits, but that does not mean there is no place for friendship between traders. In fact, sometimes there is a bit too much friendship. This has been the case with a wealthy gnomish merchant from Koroshesh, who had been a trusted partner of the government in many enterprises until now. Recently, he met with a close friend of his, who happened to be a prominent [adjective of the country in question] merchant, and they shared perhaps one to many drinks. Both of them divulged confidential trade information concerning a series of investments that their respective governments were planning to make. Once they sobered up they both took full advantage of the information and obtained a significant profit after buying into some of the areas the governments were going to invest in.\n\nThe information leak did not cause significant harm, in fact it has helped strengthen our ties with the other concerned nation. However many in the court are worried that national trade could be harmed if merchants like this continue having so loose tongues."
 khet_mandate.214.a:0 "There is no need to overreact."
 khet_mandate.214.b:0 "Tell him to watch his tongue if he wants to keep it!"

 khet_mandate.215.t:0 "Koroshesh Prospers"
 khet_mandate.215.d:0 "Koroshesh has always been a wealthy area, but under the rule of the League it is getting richer and richer every day. More ships arrive at ports than ever before, the markets are more active than ever and the workshops have never employed so many artisans. This economic prosperity has led to a population boom, both due to natural growth and to the thousands of immigrants that have arrived to the region from all of Kheterata, searching for opportunities in a place that has many to give."
 khet_mandate.215.a:0 "It is the golden age of Koroshesh"

 khet_mandate.216.t:0 "Offer for Elizna"
 khet_mandate.216.d:0 "The merchants of the Korosheshi League are always looking for opportunities to expand their enterprises and increase their profits. Recently their interest has been directed towards Elizna. The rich and prosperous island, originally known as Ibtat, was gifted by the Khetarch Baqtkhet I to the Sun Elf conqueror Jaher. It is an almost obligatory stop for traders looking to conduct businesses in Bulwar, and it houses many productive textile workshops and tea plantations. As such it is no wonder that the League is interested in it, and it is because of this that they have asked us to transfer control over the island to them, in exchange of course for substantial compensation.\n\nShould we keep this gem of the Divenhal under our direct control, or should we give the Korosheshi a chance to turn it into a magnificent Nisetaata?"
 khet_mandate.216.a:0 "Sounds like the perfect place for a few gnomes."
 khet_mandate.216.b:0 "They have enough land already."

 khet_mandate.217.t:0 "Offer for Deshak"
 khet_mandate.217.d:0 "The city of Deshak, capital of the homonymous kingdom, was originally founded as a Kheteratan colony, from which the great mineral wealth of the mountains was extracted and shipped to the Sorrow. The city has been invaded multiple times and it was almost completely destroyed by the Onslaught. It would later become the first place to be ruled by the Crodamos dynasty, and in more recent times it suffered a devastating gnollish invasion that led them to seek protection under the king of Eborthil. It holds the gate to the Divenhal, and as such anyone seeking to control the trade in this sea must also seek ownership of this precious city. This is precisely what the Korosheshi League wants, and they have offered us extensive compensation in exchange for transferring the control of the city to them. The offer is definitively tempting, and with the city in their hands they promise that they, and by extension us, will achieve total control of trade in the Divenhal."
 khet_mandate.217.a:0 "Deshak will prosper under Korosheshi rule"
 khet_mandate.217.b:0 "The city is better under our direct control"

 estate_ahati_khetist_recruitment_desc:0 "The Ahati, split in the Northern and Southern Brotherhood, are religious orders, devoted to Aakhetism, who worship the Bronze Dragon that once ruled Kheterata. They have assumed the role of upholding the mandate of the stewards of the Khet. This role includes the upholding of Aakhetism and their traditions, but also regular police duties and the protection of merchant caravans. They support our ruler for as long as they hold the mandate and prove themselves worthy Stewards."

 estate_ahati_non_khet_steward:0 "Heathen Steward"
 estate_ahati_non_khet_steward_desc:0 "The Ahati, as guardians of the Khetist faith, hold political, economic, and religious sway over the denizens of the Mother's Sorrow. And though we rule over the Kheteratan lands, we do not follow their faith or customs, leading to the Ahati distrusting us. We will suffer from disloyalty and even outright hostility for as long as we do not embrace or respect their faith and so must remain vigilant."

 estate_ahati_noble_titles:0 "Grant Noble Titles"
 estate_ahati_noble_titles_desc:0 "Legally, the Ahati are not nobility, with a large portion even being commoners. Yet, they act like aristocracy, and it cannot be denied that they exude an aura of nobility. We could therefore use their wish to be seen as nobility to our advantage and grant them actual high-born titles, personal estates, and pensions, making them noble guardians of the Khet and the Steward in both name and function. In exchange for their loyalty of course."

 estate_ahati_khet_guards:0 "Khet Guardians"
 estate_ahati_khet_guards_desc:0 "The Ahati do not think highly of khet, instead considering their own order as Guardians of the Sorrow. Let's use this to our advantage and place them in the position as bodyguards of the Sorrow's most important residents: the khet themselves. The idea is patently absurd. The number of things on Halann capable of harming a khet could be counted on one hand. A khet's bodyguard would primarily be preventing unwanted peasants from hounding the cat-headed gods with requests, as well as tending to whatever flights of fancies strike the khet. Some Ahati may consider these menial tasks beneath them, but it's a job that must be done to keep the khet placated."

 estate_ahati_meritocratic_recruitment:0 "Meritocratic Recruitment"
 estate_ahati_meritocratic_recruitment_desc:0 "The Ahati are a unique group in Kheterata, not only because of their quasi-noble status, their devotion to Aakhet, and their mostly unrecognised status, but also due to their unusual internal system of rule. They adhere strictly to their code of conduct called the "Peyimaaw". This code states that all who serve in the Ahati and show prowess in combat, and devotion to Kheterata, should have the ability to climb the ranks, regardless of their background or character. It all stems from the times of Damerian rule over the Sorrow and their devotion to honour and meritocratic rule. We can enshrine this tradition of meritocracy into law to prevent anyone with false pretences or ill motivations from taking up positions of power within the Ahati, thus ensuring their qualifications are up to our standards!"

 estate_ahati_state_merchants:0 "State Merchants"
 estate_ahati_state_merchants_desc:0 "While the Northern Brotherhood is strictly a military order, the Southern Brotherhood has over time morphed into a sort of militarised merchant guild with an iron grip over trade in the southern Salahad. This could be used to our advantage then by offering one of their most prominent merchants the position of trade envoy and boost trade for us wherever we please. While it would upset the Southern Brotherhood for a while, it may be a good investment."

 estate_ahati_support_north:0 "Support Northern Brotherhood"
 estate_ahati_support_north_desc:0 "The Northern Brotherhood is the half of the Ahati that dwells from the Divenhal Sea to Kheterat. They distinguish themselves by a strict adherence to the warrior past of the Ahati and by the devotion to Aakhet the Bronze. We could lend them our support and give them preference, which would grant us the benefit of a more loyal Brotherhood. They would, in return, be able to put their focus on professionalisation, and lending their support in the maintenance of fortifications and the building of defensive works across the realm."
 estate_ahati_support_tooltip:0 "We can only support one of the two brotherhoods at a time."

 estate_ahati_support_south:0 "Support Southern Brotherhood"
 estate_ahati_support_south_desc:0 "The Southern Brotherhood is the half of the Ahati which roams the Southern Salahad and beyond. The local circumstances or in one word; gnolls, morphed them into a hybrid between a merchant guild and a military order, as the Brotherhood's attention is in large part reserved for the protection of the Irsmahpani caravansaries. Many Southern Ahati are both merchant and soldier and hold the continuation of trade in high regard, with only their devotion to Kheterata taking up a higher priority. We could lend them our support and give them priority, which would boost our overall trade and, by giving them more rights, they could lend us a helping hand in solving local problems along the trade routes."

 estate_ahati_support_brotherhoods:0 "Support the Brotherhoods"
 estate_ahati_support_brotherhoods_desc:0 "We have taken full control over both brotherhoods and united them into one.

Instead, we will finally benefit from both parts of the Ahati; militaristic and commercial at the same time."

 estate_ahati_state_equipment:0 "State Provided Equipment"
 estate_ahati_state_equipment_desc:0 "The Ahati have traditionally gathered their gear from a multitude of sources; most will pay for their equipment themselves, with some Ahati having enough resources to equip a small army, while others get them from donations by wealthy sympathisers. All of this equipment varies wildly in origin and function, making the Ahati look more like a motley band of fanatics than guardians of the mandate. We could remedy this by providing the brotherhoods with state produced and standardised equipment. It would boost both their loyalty and make it easier for them to have repairs done after combat, but it would also entail a hefty strain on our arms production."

 estate_ahati_ahati_commanders:0 "Ahati Commanders"
 estate_ahati_ahati_commanders_desc:0 "Unlike the nobility, who gain their station through name and commission, Ahati officers gain their ranks through showing their worth and demonstrating their skills on the field of battle. This meritocratic form of promotion and upholding of quality within the ranks of the officer corps has shown to be significantly better than having nobles buy themselves into the military staff. It may therefore be a good idea to just enlist Ahati officers into our armies and have them lead on the field of battle instead. It would be costly, and would give the brotherhoods sway over our armies, but at the same time, greatly improve the quality and experience of our officer corps."

 estate_ahati_militarization:0 "Encourage Militarization"
 estate_ahati_militarization_desc:0 "While both brotherhoods are mainly focused on military training, both do indulge in trade and commerce. Especially the Southern Brotherhood, who have over time turned into a sort of heavily armed trade guild, lay their focus on maintaining and dominating the flow of trade along the banks of the Sorrow. While we cannot deny their value in commerce, we do also have to acknowledge that it comes at the cost of their military training and quality. We can, in order to remedy this, encourage them to abandon part of their assets and trade ventures and focus more on military matters instead. It would improve their quality and prowess, at the cost of some trade of course."

By giving the Ahati control over the judicial duties in the colonial territories, we can kill two birds with one stone; by sending the more unruly members of the Ahati across the sea, we can keep them far away from the centre of power, while at the same time tightening our grip over the colonies by having the Ahati enforce our rules and laws."

It is therefore only logical that the Ahati are fanatic guardians of Kheteratan customs and will do anything to either guard or expand our glorious traditions and habits. By funding a special cultural program, we may be able to send Ahati members to the far corners of the realm and proselytise our naturally superior culture to those who may be Khetist, yet still lack the finesse of true Kheteratan etiquette."

The Ahati hold control over large estates along the Mother's Sorrow and refuse to hand over the bounties of the river to the state, causing disruptions in both food distribution and the flow of commerce.

 ahati_events.1.t:0 "The Ahati"
 ahati_events.1.d:0 "Servants of the Sorrow, Guardians of the people, protectors of honour, valour and justice. This is just one way to describe the Ahati brotherhoods, who have since the times of Aakhet the Bronze Dragon been organised as an unrecognised yet highly skilled military order, devoted to the lands of the Sorrow and its denizens.\n\nOrganised in a more militaristic Northern Brotherhood and a quasi mercantile, quasi martial Southern Brotherhood, they form a presence throughout the entirety of the Lands of the Sorrow. They are extremely organised and employ a rather rigid hierarchy, which has given them a level of discipline, rivalled by few. Yet none is judged or treated differently because of their birth, as the Ahati are the epitome of a meritocracy, a leftover from the occupation of the Sorrow by the Damerians, who the Ahati see as one of their primary influences. As such, they have seen many high ranking leaders, who came from the lowest of backgrounds, like Ramash the "Clothless" who had lived as a beggar for years before joining the ranks as one of their best swordsmen, or Siyek "Foultaint" who started as a tanner for the order before proving his worth as a skilled organiser.\n\nAnother thing which sets the order apart is their devotion to Aakhet, the Bronze Dragon. Aakhet once ruled the Kheteratan lands and praised those who showed honour and valour, something which the Ahati have woven into the fabric of their orders. They therefore do not really revere the Khet, and some even accuse them of being nothing more than a dragon cult with a veneer of Khetism as to prevent persecution. They do however put great importance in how the Steward of the Sorrow behaves: Whether the Stewards show that they are worthy, honourable and noble. They want the steward to be an example for all to follow through action; be devoted to the people and to the lands they govern. These standards are to be met, or the Ahati may be provoked into action.\n\nOur employment of the Ahati will grant us a disciplined and professional fighting force, together with providing administrative and economic support, if we so desire. They are a great boon to our nation, at a cost that is."
 ahati_events.1.a:0 "Glory will be ours, Kheterata and Ahati together!"


 ahati_events.30.t:0 "Prominent Ahati"
 ahati_events.30.d:0 "The Ahati are, as we know, one of the most skilled fighters in the Salahad and beyond. Most of the Ahati can, after years of training, best most of our officers and specialists in one-on -one combat with great ease. And one such Ahati has now proven themselves to be even greater than that. They have proven to be a great and skilled swordsman, moving as if dancing on the sands. Combined with being a genius strategist and great leader, they make for a perfect advisor to our forces, whether to train our officer corps or create war plans. Luckily we have been granted approval by the Ahati to hire him as such."
 ahati_events.30.a:0 "May his name be sung for the ages!"

 ahati_events.31.t:0 "Up in Arms"
 ahati_events.31.d:0 ""By the Khet you are fools! No matter what we do, it is never enough for you extremist types, and you don't even seem to really care for results, only your own maddening arrogance!" With these stern words did the governor of [event_province.GetName] storm off back to this office. For days the local Ahati officers and the governor have been fighting with each other over how to fix local problems. Whether it is leaks in dykes and dams, broken roads or more tricky things like unemployment and poverty, the Ahati keep coming back to the governor, demanding immediate action. The governor has made it clear that his resources are spread thin already and that he cannot fix things with the snap of his finger. He now demands that the state intervene and take care of these meddlesome Ahati. The Ahati on the other hand demand the replacement of the governor with somebody more capable, preferably one educated by the brotherhoods themselves. Our advisors think that mediation is the best course of action, but that we could also have them work it out by themselves and just see what happens."
 ahati_events.31.a:0 "Start mediation, and try to satisfy both."
 ahati_events.31.b:0 "Work it out yourselves, you're supposed to be adults and professionals."

 ahati_events.32.t:0 "Ahati Justice"
 ahati_events.32.d:0 ""Another one, and quick you hag!!" The nobleman shouted. It was late and in a small bar sat a lonely nobleman, wasted after dozens of bottles of fruity liqueur. He begins to throw bottles to the ground and threaten people with violence and that he will take away their possessions. All the while, a lone Ahati is sitting in the corner, quietly observing the so-called "lord". But when the nobleman grabs a waitress and demands her to come with him he intervenes. Without a single flinch he unsheathed his sword and decapitates the nobleman on the spot. And as the nobleman's head falls to the ground, the people cheer, as some recall this nobleman having been trouble before.\n\nThe family of the nobleman, alongside other representatives of the nobility, are furious however. They demand the Ahati soldier to be trialled and executed, as he had no right to kill a nobleman, even if he was a danger to commoners. Will we adhere to the demand of the nobles, or will brand this as justice served, even if it was not "by the book.""
 ahati_events.32.a:0 "Arrest him, a murder is still a murder."
 ahati_events.32.b:0 "Just compensate the family and sweep this under the rug."
 ahati_events.32.c:0 "Justice was served, honour this vigilant servant of the law!"

 ahati_events.33.t:0 "Questionable Services"
 ahati_events.33.d:0 "Normally, Ahati are known for their honourable behaviour and extremely rigid sense of justice. They are by many seen as a group that cannot even fathom the idea of breaking the law, and thinking of them as criminals is nothing more than a bad joke. But we have now encountered this impossibility, or more accurately, improbability. A group of Ahati seems to be extorting caravans for protection money, with those who refuse to pay being attacked by bandits just shortly after. It really seems like these two groups are working together and are hurting trade in the province for their own benefit. They must be brought to justice!"
 ahati_events.33.a:0 "Arrest them and question them to get to the bandits!"
 ahati_events.33.b:0 "I want a 10% cut. I'll make sure no investigations are held."

 ahati_events.34.t:0 "Fort Reinforcement"
 ahati_events.34.d:0 "While we have an army which could occupy each and every corner of the realm, doing so would be an almost insurmountable task. This means that some forts have a smaller garrison than we would perhaps desire. The Ahati have proposed to garrison the local fortress in [event_province.GetName] and offered to pay for the upkeep themselves. We will in exchange grant them official ownership over the fort."
 ahati_events.34.a:0 "Sounds good, right?"
 ahati_events.34.b:0 "We can manage it on our own."

 ahati_events.35.t:0 "Local Barracks"
 ahati_events.35.d:0 "The Ahati have in the last years been growing exponentially. Many young men join their ranks and many more desire to do so. This has led to the Ahati needing more space for housing and training. They have therefore proposed the building of barracks in [event_province.GetName] to house both their cadets, soldiers and personnel, alongside ours. They think that there is much to be won from having the Ahati and regulars live, work and train together. They will pay the cost of the building, in exchange for future favours."
 ahati_events.35.a:0 "We will take them up on this offer."
 ahati_events.35.b:0 "Let us not be indebted to the Ahati…"

 ahati_events.36.t:0 "Connected Traders"
 ahati_events.36.d:0 "Boosting the economy is something that our state does on a regular basis, whether it be setting up new market towns, pull-ups for caravans, or expanding industry. The Ahati, especially the Southern Brotherhood do have an interest in commerce and economic activity as well and have started to set up shop in [event_province.GetName]. They even offer us to take over management of the markets and to share the profits with us. A nice offer indeed, boosting our economy and easing the burden of administration there as well. We would however be handing over a powerful Centre of Trade to the Ahati, who can do with it as they please."
 ahati_events.36.a:0 "Deal!"
 ahati_events.36.b:0 "No deal!"

 ahati_events.37.t:0 "Assassination"
 ahati_events.37.d:0 "A puddle of blood. This was the first thing the servant found when she entered the bedchambers of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Following the trail of blood, she made the most horrifying of discoveries: our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], bludgeoned to death with a small Khet statue.\n\nThe news spread quickly, and many wondered who could have done this? Were it our rivals? Or was it a family fight that got out of hand? A jealous concubine? An heir who could not wait to ascend the throne? No one can say for sure, and the only thing we do know is that the murder of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has shocked the realm to its core. Our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will now ascend the throne and take up the mantle of Steward of the Sorrow. Let us hope that they do not meet a similar fate."
 ahati_events.37.a:0 "who could have done this?"

 ahati_events.38.t:0 "Wealthy Calligraphy"
 ahati_events.38.d:0 "The gnomes living in the delta of the Sorrow are known for being one of the most skilled gem cutters and one of the most artistic of calligraphers. Their skill in applying the most beautiful of letters, hieroglyphs, and symbols onto whatever surface desired is unmatched. They are however extremely expensive, as each character is given as much care as the next.\n\nAnd it has now come to our attention that the Ahati, swimming in wealth, have been hiring almost all gnomish calligraphers to decorate their walls, works of literature, and other surfaces, preventing other people from getting their own calligraphy works. Many now demand a ban on the hiring of calligraphy by the Ahati. It would be a unique form of economic interference, and the Ahati would almost certainly protest."
 ahati_events.38.a:0 "Issue a temporary ban, the Ahati can spend their money elsewhere"
 ahati_events.38.b:0 "We can't interfere in this, it would be ridiculous."

 ahati_events.39.t:0 "Contested Inheritance"
 ahati_events.39.d:0 ""Inheritances are a matter of tradition and trust"\n\nThese words, spoken by the notary did not really make our dilemma any easier. We are called upon by a nobleman and a local Ahati commander over the inheritance of the nobleman's father. The father in question had written a will in which he promised all his possessions to the local Ahati garrison, as he had been good friends with the former commander and had been a regular guest at the garrison, entertaining them with many stories from his many travels to many lands many miles away. The garrison was to get the inheritance, yet the noble son demands that this deal is annulled. He claims the right to the inheritance on the basis of dynastic continuation and the fact that the Ahati are, at least in his eyes, not nobility. He also argues that the former commander, with whom his father was friends, died years ago and that this means that no human connection can be made between the deceased and the beneficiary. We must now decide who will get the inheritance, before the two sides turn to violence over it"
 ahati_events.39.a:0 "Give it to the Ahati"
 ahati_events.39.b:0 "Give it to the noble"
 ahati_events.39.c:0 "Neither, it will go to the state coffers!"


 ahati_events.40.t:0 "The Coin Must Flow"
 ahati_events.40.d:0 "The Ahati, while mostly militant, have in the past and present shown to be cunning and talented merchants. They have, due to their code, build up a reputation of being honest traders and making fair deals. And while most Ahati are very strict in upholding this, they cannot always keep themselves from taking advantage of a good situation. And as such a group of Ahati merchants in [event_province.GetName] were able to make a lucrative trade deal which benefits not only them, but us as well. The coin flows to our coffers and the locals benefit as well through this expansion of local trade. We could just compliment and thank the merchants, or perhaps reward them and hope they'll repeat their endeavours."
 ahati_events.40.a:0 "Reward them!"
 ahati_events.40.b:0 "That's nice"

 ahati_events.41.t:0 "Vengence for Kheterata"
 ahati_events.41.d:0 "Relations between human and gnoll have for the most part been tense, to say the least. This has been so ever since the gnolls and humans first interacted. The Ahati, who see in the gnolls nothing but invaders and despoilers, are even more hateful towards these furry inhabitants of Salahad. And a band of Ahati have shown this hatred through pure slaughter and destruction by attacking a gnollish village in [event_province.GetName]. They have burned the dwellings, killed not just the men, but the woman and the children too. None have been spared and the smoke of death and destruction can be seen from far away.\n\nAnd while some villages have been lost already, some are still intact and so we can intervene if we wish to. Stopping them would anger the Ahati, but improve our standing with our gnollish subjects. We could also look the other way and let the Ahati rage rain down upon the gnolls as they please."
 ahati_events.41.a:0 "Stop you fools"
 ahati_events.41.b:0 "Kill the demons"
 ahati_events.41.c:0 "We must put the past behind us"

 ahati_events.42.t:0 "Soldiers Resigning"
 ahati_events.42.d:0 "As the Ahati's fame and influence grows, so does their attraction. Many young men dream of joining the Ahati, yet few actually go through with it. And while most soldiers choose to join our army instead, more and more of those are having second thoughts and are resigning with one goal: joining the brotherhoods. They hope that their previous experience and training will help them in their application and training. While we could forbid our soldiers from joining the Ahati via contracts or special perks, we could also just let them go as forcing them to stay could seriously demotivate them and make them more of a nuisance than an asset."
 ahati_events.42.a:0 "Good luck and many blessings!"
 ahati_events.42.b:0 "They signed, they stay!"

 ahati_events.100.t:0 "Unworthy"
 ahati_events.100.d:0 "The crickets chirped and the air was breezy though comfortable. Overlooking the calm flow of the Mother's Sorrow, our ruler gazed upon the thousands of lights that lit up Kheterata, the great pyramids in the distance, and barges with Khet floating peacefully on the river. It was an otherwise unassuming evening when all of a sudden a vase seemed to have crashed to the ground in the bedchamber of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Curious, [Root.Monarch.GetName] inspected what happened and saw the vase, broken in a dozen pieces, a vase that could not have been blown over or knocked down by an animal, only a human…\n\nAlarmed our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] looked for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword yet it was gone, and before being able to make it to the door they felt a sharp and sudden sensation of pain. A silverlined dragon shaped blade appeared through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest, its glint offering our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a last look at themselves before collapsing on the floor.\n\nWhen the great steward was found by the maid, panic ensued within the palace confines. And with the palace closed off, an investigation started, one which would not take long. The head of the Royal Guard upon inspecting the wound concluded that only one type of blade could make such a strangely shaped cut; a Dragonsdagger. And while knives in the shape of animals are not uncommon, in the Salahad, it are only the Ahati who carry Dragonsdaggers: the Ahati brotherhoods.\n\nBut why would they do this, and more pressing, why would they use their own blades when this would almost certainly expose them? These questions would not go unanswered for long as a great ruckus developed in the markets.\n\nThere an Ahati officer stood, flanked by guards, ranting about the misconduct of our late steward. The priest claimed that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the ruling dynasty in general did not have the mandate to be Stewards of the Sorrow any longer! They called for a new steward to rise to the throne of Kheterata, and for the ruling dynasty to vacate these lands immediately. Reports from other cities tell us of similar occurrences. Aakhetist priests or Ahati officers openly denouncing our government and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in the streets. They claim that the economy has slumped, that the Khet do not really support us and that the realm is headed towards catastrophe. They make the gullible fearful, and few dare to speak against the Ahati's claim, fearing for their own lives."
 ahati_events.100.a:0 "Times of darkness and death are upon us…"
 ahati_events.100.tooltip:0 "§RThis is only the beginning§!"

 ahati_events.101.t:0 "The Ahati Revolt"
 ahati_events.101.d:0 "The initial subordination of the Ahati, by assassinating our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], was thought to be the spark that would light the powder keg, yet it actually remained quiet for a while. The Ahati officers stopped their incessant ranting after a few days and their soldiers seemed to remain at their posts. And as the funeral of the late steward remained peaceful, confusion hit the population. What are the Ahati up to? Are they going to actually attempt to kill the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as well, or are they content with them? Nobody knew, and the government did not dare to ask the Ahati leadership, fearing that this may push them to action. All was quiet, and in hindsight we should have seen it for what it was: a calm before the storm.\n\nIt started in the more far away outposts of the realm; Ahati soldiers and officers all of a sudden, and in many cases in the darkness of the night, marched into local government offices, forts, and other locations where they had already build up their influence.They seemed to have planned for this as these takeovers went without barely any incident. Now the Ahati have started to take control over a myriad of both military and economic centres. They say that they no longer acknowledge our state as the stewards of the realm and therefore are no longer required to remain in our forts and encampments. While some officers have made it clear to the Ahati that they see this as desertion, they refrain from further action as they are aware that taking disciplinary actions could end in open conflict. The Ahati seem to vacate each and all post that is under our command and leave not even a breadcrumb behind. The people are confused and not even the families of the Ahati know what is going on, or so they claim at least. We wonder and above all fear what may come, and so does the entirety of the government. \n\nThe general staff now fears that a civil war is upon us, and that this may well tear our country apart through violence and destruction. Some say that we should attempt to open diplomatic talks with the Ahati, while others denounce this and say that we have pampered the Ahati for too long already and that we must prepare to teach the these traitors a lesson and show them that they are nothing but spoiled and arrogant faux-nobility. And while our staff bickers and fights over what our next course of actions should be, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seems to remain quiet, paralyzed by the thought of internal collapse. A revolt of those we thought to be loyal to the steward is approaching and it may well change the realm beyond recognition. We cannot know for sure when the first blow will come, only that it will come sooner than later. And for now there may not be much we can do, other than praying to the Khet, gathering our forces and hoping that the commoners will see that we are still the true Stewards of the Khet and the Sorrow."

 ahati_events.102.d:0 "Sometimes the pieces of a puzzle do not seem to make any sense until you gain a new perspective. Sometimes, hindsight shows what was in front very clearly for so long and makes it seem like we were blind. Sometimes, it is a forced change of perspective that makes everything obvious.\n\nWhen the Ahati announced to the city's governor that the Bronze Dragon Academy would be renovated thoroughly, nobody batted an eye. Even not as the renovation plans clearly showed that the academy would become a heavily armed and fortified citadel which had no place in a location like Aakheta and was more suitable as a borderfort in locations like the Salahad Gate or the southern desert passages. But now it all makes sense, it now makes sense that they were planning for a war all along and that this fort was meant to be the impregnable fortress with walls as sturdy as the scales of the dragon that gave the academy its name.\n\nAnd so as the renovations were finished, the Ahati's revolt started. A massive warning sign that stood there, laughing at us and our cluelessness. The fort has now taken the role of headquarters for the Ahati, with massive amounts of weapons, equipment and food being hoarded within its bronze bellows.\n\nWith this fortress in their hands, the Ahati have truly become a state within a state and are no longer bound to our laws and commands. The Ahati do not fear our justice system anymore, as they were the justice system in these lands. They do not listen to the steward anymore, as they believe themselves to be the stewards. They do not respect the local traditions anymore, as for them, only their own traditions matter."

 ahati_events.103.d:0 "Panic had spread like a fever across the palace. The main foyer was filled with administrators and generals running to and fro, each trying to make sense of the civil war that the nation was collapsing into. The lone exception was Aakhet in his normal non-draconic form, who sat on the steps of the palace, watching the commotion while whistling an old Kheteratan marching tune. Upon spotting you, a large grin spread across his face.\n\n"What an almighty mess your predecessors have gotten you into," said Aakhet, clearly revelling in the chaos. "Would it shock you to learn that I had nothing to do with this? The Ahati may worship me, but I do not control their actions. It was only inevitable a string of weak rulers would eventually draw their ire. If your predecessor was still alive, I would be out there marching alongside them."\n\nHe stood up and laid His hand on your shoulder. "I am not on their side. However, neither am I on your side. The only one who I stand with is the one who has the fortitude to see this war through. I am sure you shall miss my guidance and wisdom." Aakhet pretended to wipe a tear from his eye, failing to mask his grin. "But if you are truly the rightful ruler of [Root.GetName], then you will have no problems crushing this uprising. Without my assistance.""

 ahati_events.111.t:0 "Price of Power"
 ahati_events.111.d:0 "While the Ahati existed ages ago already, they never received any real recognition from the government until we did. Part of this deal was the granting of noble titles, estates, and land to the Ahati, partly to placate them, and partly to help them ease their costs by making them at least partly self-sufficient through the granting of agricultural land and labourers. And while this has both literally and figuratively born fruit for them, we seem to be getting the short end of the stick. The Ahati now use their titles, influence and land to undermine our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the state's grip over taxes and trade. We are monitoring the situation, but our predictions are that the longer they hold their estates and influence, the weaker our authority will become."

 ahati_events.112.d:0 "While all our troops have sworn an oath of fealty to their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], many are as of now rethinking their loyalties. Whether it is due to them actually believing the Ahati lies about our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] losing favour and being a bad steward, fearing that they may be slaughtered by the Aakhetist fanatics, or because they secretly aspire to join the brotherhoods, it does not matter; many simply refuse to continue their service. We are having a hard time keeping the common soldier in line at the moment and have already been forced to increase payments and pension, as to prevent outright mutiny or mass desertion. And even then, getting young men to sign up for service is costing us more and more crowns every day. And while some of the demands they make are beyond ridiculous, the situation forces us to accept or negotiate. We will lose a lot of wealth, just so we can keep our army together and our own soldiers placated. Let us hope that we will not run out of money…"

 ahati_events.113.d:0 "We once granted the Ahati control over large sections of the army with the expectation that it would improve both our quality and the loyalty of the Ahati. And for a while at least, it seemed that the Ahati made excellent generals and loyal officers, who led our armies to great victories on the battlefield. Yet as the Aakhetists have started their revolt, these officers begin to show their true colours. Only a very small and select cadre of generals seem to have remained loyal to the state and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and the non-Ahati part of the military staff fears that some of those have stayed only to spy on us. They conclude that a purge of the officer corps will be needed post haste as the more these potential spies stay in their place, the more information they could transfer to their treacherous brethren. Getting new and, most importantly, qualified officers will be costly and take a while.\n\n It also seems that the Ahati loyalists have either destroyed or taken away the blueprints of the brotherhood's fortresses and strongholds, leaving us essentially blind during a siege. We are trying to get some old copies from the archives, but they will most likely be either out of date or incomplete. The road ahead will be bumpy, and there are not many leaders to guide us on that road it seems."

 ahati_events.114.t:0 "The Open Mind"
 ahati_events.114.d:0 ""An army of warriors conquers, an army of scribes consolidates"\n\nThis ancient saying is perhaps the best way to show how a realm stays together. For soldiers are good at taking land, but keeping it loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is something which only the tact and hard work of the scribes, administrators, and advisors can achieve. And for years, those scribes and advisors were trained and hired by the Ahati. What once started as a way to cut costs and to improve the overall quality of the administrative cadre, slowly morphed into an essential part of the state apparatus. The Ahati delivered us some of the most disciplined, loyal, and honourable administrators, their quality far beyond what we could achieve.\n\nAnd it is this which now bites us in the back. These administrators and advisors may be getting their payment from us, they still hold some loyalties to the Ahati, as many would have never gotten the opportunity to even learn basic reading and writing were it not for the brotherhoods. Some advisors have already abandoned their posts or have started to follow orders from the Ahati instead of ours and are abusing their posts to frustrate our efforts and projects. The Ahati have gained a direct look into the mind of the state and its machinations, giving them a massive advantage and leaving our administration filled with traitors, spies and saboteurs. We will have to get a hefty bag of money to get these advisors back to their jobs and buy their loyalty back. It will be a hefty sum, and even then it may not be guaranteed to work."
 ahati_events.114.a:0 "You're still loyal, right? right?!"

 ahati_events.115.t:0 "Loosened Grip"
 ahati_events.115.d:0 "Everything seemed unassuming as the messenger approached the fortress.The walls were manned, but not by regular soldiers, they were Ahati. When approaching the gate the military scribe was halted by an Ahati guard. "Those who still remain loyal to the illegitimate steward of the Sorrow will be barred from entrance". These stern words from the guard confused the scribe, and he replied: "I am a loyal soldier of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and I must be let through. We have both sworn to uphold justice in these lands and to protect the Steward of the Sorrow in all capacities." The guard looked unimpressed and simply replied: That is true, yet the fool you follow is no longer the true Steward of the Sorrow. Either you swear loyalty to the true Stewards or you get lost." Angered and irritated, the scribe turned and went back to his outpost to report what had happened.\n\nWe have a myriad of similar occurrences of the Ahati refusing our armies, state merchants, and scribes entrance to towns, forts, or agricultural estates. All of them report that the Ahati have simply stopped acknowledging our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as the Steward and seem to claim the title for themselves, foolish as it may be. More and more sectors along the Sorrow seem to have entered a state of de facto independence, as the Ahati refused to pay taxes, send the harvest, or even let non-Ahati merchants do business in the places they occupy."
 ahati_events.115.a:0 "Will there ever be an end to the suffering??"

 ahati_events.116.t:0 "No more Submission"
 ahati_events.116.d:0 "When we asked the Ahati to watch over our subjects and their administrative and military matters, we were ecstatic. The Ahati would on our cost improve the inner workings of our subjects and in return those subjects would remain content under our protection. A more perfect deal seemed to be impossible. Yet, it now seems to actually have backfired. The Ahati hold significant influence over our subjects and tributaries and have started to use this influence to incite rebellion, disloyalty, or outright sedition. We cannot fully rely on our subjects any longer and can expect them to remain at the sidelines when the Ahati decide to make a move. Waiting to see who comes out on top."
 ahati_events.116.a:0 "Curse those traitors to damnation, they will get what they deserve eventually!"

 ahati_events.131.t:0 "Fort Takeover"
 ahati_events.131.d:0 "When we gave the Ahati control over certain forts within the realm, we thought that it would ease the strain on our military capabilities. The idea was that we could rely on them to man the forts and aid us in guarding the realm against hostiles and insurgencies. And they did, until now. Now they are the insurgency, and now they have control over the forts, withholding entrance to our troops, messengers, or any other civilian loyal to the crown. \n\nThe takeover of these forts has resulted in us losing control over the fort in [event_province.GetName, meaning that our grip over the region has weakened significantly. "
 ahati_events.131.a:0 "I know how to get in, just get me a lot of wood!"

 ahati_events.132.t:0 "Closed Economy"
 ahati_events.132.d:0 "Our dealings with the Ahati were not entirely of a military nature, as the Ahati showed a keen eye for trade as well. The Southern Brotherhood in particular, excelled in setting up successful trade hubs, investing in lucrative opportunities and making sure the flow of commerce kept on going along the Sorrow. And because of this, we gave them control over such hubs. This has now backfired as they have taken full control over the markets there and have barred every merchant that does not declare themselves loyal to the Ahati from entering, causing a hefty blow to our economy and commercial activity in the area."
 ahati_events.132.a:0 "So delivery times are getting even worse?!"

 ahati_events.133.t:0 "Ahati Homes"
 ahati_events.133.d:0 "As the Ahati expanded, new quarters were needed. We therefore provided them with a large amount of land to build new barracks and fortifications on, like the one in [event_province.GetName]. This benefited them with new sleeping quarters and connections to the local population, while benefiting us as those soldiers bolstered security, increasing trade and the local economy and our tax revenue. But as with other Ahati affiliated locations, this one has also now turned into a local stronghold, barring our armies from entering or staying. These Ahati are also attempting to sway the local populace to their sides and are spreading vile lies and fake stories about our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ahati_events.133.a:0 "They will regret their insolence one day!"

 ahati_events.150.t:0 "Ahati Governor"
 ahati_events.150.d:0 "The Ahati enjoy support from all walks of life. From the lowest of servants up to the most noble of generals. Which means that some of our own administrators do so as well. While most have remained loyal to the state, some administrators have already declared themselves sympathetic and loyal to the Ahati cause or impartial, which just means that they will wait and see until a clear victor has emerged. And as such, one of these Ahati sympathetic governors has opened up the gate of his provincial capital to the Ahati and has formally declared his support for the revolt. We have lost control over all the local fortifications and any tax revenue is now being confiscated by the Ahati."
 ahati_events.150.a:0 "It's treason then."

 ahati_events.151.t:0 "Traitor"
 ahati_events.151.d:0 "Many of our officers and generals received a military education from the Ahati, as they were the best of the best. We always thought that even though they were Ahati trained, that they would still be loyal./nHow wrong we were.\n\nWhen the first batch of officers switched sides we were relieved that some still remained, hoping they would truly be loyal.\nHow wrong we were.\n\nWe now discovered that one such general has been leaking battleplans, fort maps, and equipment information to the Ahati via other treacherous officers. The Ahati now know even more about our military and our inner workings and the damage will be significant. We should perhaps just execute the general and his accomplishers, to prevent any more leaks. Or we could try to bribe him, hoping that cash will make him loyal again, but we may be wrong again."
 ahati_events.151.a:0 "off with his head!"
 ahati_events.151.b:0 "Give him a sack of money and monitor him."

 ahati_events.152.t:0 "Khetarch's Aid"
 ahati_events.152.d:0 "We are the Stewards of the Sorrow and the first and foremost servants of the Khet. We are the ones who ought to guard the great river and protect the deities which live on it. And by the Khet, do we do our job as well as we can, but now we need the help of the Khet themselves. We would do well to ask the Khet in blessing us and reminding the people that they are to be loyal to us, as we are the first servants of the Khet. We would do well to ask the Khet's help in reminding the people that those who oppose us, oppose the Khet themselves!\n\nLet us approach the divine felines of the Sorrow and ask for help."
 ahati_events.152.a:0 "Oh great Khet, give us a blessing so we may bless you with…chin scratches."
 ahati_events.152.b:0 "No way, we can remind the people of their loyalties without their help!"

 ahati_events.153.t:0 "An Offer of Aid"
 ahati_events.153.d:0 "When the Ahati's insubordination started, we felt alone. All around the court did officers, advisors and staff leave to join the traitors and their foolish ramblings. We felt like the whole of the court crumbled and all our friends were about to leave us to metaphorically rot away in a dark corner. Today we were reminded that we are not alone, as one of our allies has offered us both military and economic support in our struggle against the traitors. Accepting it would be a great boon, but it may push the Ahati to seek outside support as well."
 ahati_events.153.a:0 "I knew I could count on them!"
 ahati_events.153.b:0 "Let us keep this conflict internal. So thanks, no thanks."

 ahati_events.154.t:0 "Pirate Raid"
 ahati_events.154.d:0 "Pirates, whether they come from Bulwar, Cannor, or Salahad, are a nuisance that has existed in the Divenhal ever since the first boat was invented. We have however seen an uptick in pirate activity in the last couple of months, and our suspicions are that these pirates have received letters of marque from the Ahati. This has led to many outlaws sailing along our coasts and raiding our towns, forts, and villages, all the while the Ahati do nothing to stop them. There are also fears that these raids may escalate resentment towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and push the coastal population towards the Ahati. We could attempt to stop the pirates, though it will cost us. Yet the alternative may be even worse."
 ahati_events.154.a:0 "Stop them and hang them!"
 ahati_events.154.b:0 "I'm a landlubber, not a sailor!"

 ahati_events.155.t:0 "Nisetataa Loans"
 ahati_events.155.d:0 "Within the delta of the Sorrow lives a unique minority, that of the Delta Gnomes. These Gnomes have been living here since ancient times and form a distinctive group within society. They adopted many local Kheteratan traditions and habits, yet have also remained distinctively Gnomish. They form one of the most productive groups within society, especially in the production of magically infused gemstones and luxurious calligraphy.\n\nLooking for special weapons, the Ahati have struck a deal with the Delta Gnomes. The gnomes have been granted the promise of lands, resources, and autonomy in exchange for magical gemstones that the Ahati can use in battle, giving them an edge over us. We have the ability to remind the gnomes who they ought to be loyal to and to confiscate the gems, but we should be wary as it will provoke the Ahati in defending their newly acquired equipment."
 ahati_events.155.a:0 "Send the men, confiscate their wares, and remind the gnomes who their master is!"
 ahati_events.155.b:0 "We'll deal with them later…"

 ahati_events.156.t:0 "The South Stirs"
 ahati_events.156.d:0 "The Southern Brotherhood has always been more wealthy due to their dabbling in trade and economic ventures, while the Northern Brotherhood has always remained a strictly militaristic order, with the exception of some agricultural estates in order to support themselves.\n\nThe Northern Brotherhood has, because of their lower economic interest, now been facing the problem of shortages and has to remedy this by requesting their southern brothers to send aid. The Southern Brotherhood has therefore sent a large convoy of barges and camel caravans to the north with supplies. We could intercept these convoys and deny the enemy passage, though it will almost certainly result in violence."
 ahati_events.156.a:0 "Violence will come anyways, so why not start now?"
 ahati_events.156.b:0 "We can't risk escalation yet. Just make sure we list everything."

 ahati_events.157.t:0 "The Grain War"
 ahati_events.157.d:0 ""Those who hold the stems of gold, hold the coffers of gold"\n\nThis Kheteratan proverb may be the best way to sum up the importance of agriculture in the lands of the Sorrow. Not only are those who live on the shores of the Sorrow dependent on the grain that grows here for food, most denizens of the Sorrows banks work in agriculture as well. And now the Ahati have taken advantage of this. They have, in a well coordinated manner, taken over almost all of our grainstorages and are holding the population in a chokehold. Those who do not swear loyalty are denied food from the storages, even those who grew the very food that the Ahati now control! We must retake the storehouses and chase away the traitors before they spark food riots all across the realm. We could of course import food, but this would be extremely expensive and would damage our own economy in the process."
 ahati_events.157.a:0 "Begun, the Grain War has."
 ahati_events.157.b:0 "Import the best oars of gold, for the lowest amounts of gold"

 ahati_events.158.t:0 "The Sack of Anarat"
 ahati_events.158.d:0 "Burned corpses litter the street and hundreds hang from posts and windows. The smell of burn and blood drowns the city and the land surrounding it, and a woman sits on the ground, weeping. As she is letting her tears water the ground like Nirat waters the Sorrow, she holds her child, lifeless as it may be. She does not care for her burning house, or the annihilation of her livelihood, as her most cared for possession, her child has died, at the hands of a firestorm of rage and violence brought on by the Ahati.\n\nThe city of Anarat, on the banks of the Sorrow, is one of the most important cities in the realm thanks to its massive markets, international business ventures, and large production facilities. It is one of the economic centres of the Salahad and an artery of commerce.\n\nBut now the Ahati have come to town. They plundered the city and slaughtered thousands of innocents, took everything of value and left not a single dwelling unscorched. It is almost as if they were attempting to emulate their master, Aakhet.\n\nThe Sack of Anarat is nothing but a sickly display of their loyalty to the Bronze Dragon and to violence itself. Almost all men were killed with the women and children left behind to pick up the pieces. But for us, there is no time to weep. Like dragons, these plunderers are no men. They are beasts that should be hunted down and slaughtered, for all to see. The Ahati have gone too far, and so we must return the favour. Let them taste the wrath of the Steward and the tears of their failure."
 ahati_events.158.a:0 "Anarat will be avenged, we will bring the Ahati horde to its knees!"
 ahati_events.158.b:0 "I cannot fight, I can only weep."

 ahati_events.159.t:0 "The Desecration of Nirat"
 ahati_events.159.d:0 "With disobedience towards our state comes disobedience towards our faith. The Ahati follow the Dragon Aakhet who they believe is the true incarnation of Elikhet. And as such, they do not care for our temples and shrines dedicated to the greatest of Khet, like Nirakhet. This has led to a group of Aakhetist zealots attacking, desecrating and plundering the largest temple complex of Nirat and putting it to the torch. We have only a very short time to react and to halt the desecration of the main place of worship to Nirat. We must act now, or the temple and its relics will be lost!"
 ahati_events.159.a:0 "Stop these extremists and kill them all!"
 ahati_events.159.b:0 "Temples can be rebuilt, men cannot!"

 ahati_events.160.t:0 "Extermination of Demons"
 ahati_events.160.d:0 "When we took over the Stewardship, tensions were high. We are no humans, in fact, to many of our subjects we are nothing more than beasts. And though we have shown to be good stewards to both human and gnoll alike, many, especially the Ahati still resent and despise us.\n\nAnd in a fit of racial violence, did the Ahati destroy a massive number of villages of peaceful gnolls in multiple regions of the realm, leaving not a single soul alive. It was as it seems coordinated chaos, as some attacks seem to have been planned, while others clearly show a hateful impulsiveness. Our troops now demand that vengeance is taken upon these insurgent murderers, and that they meet the same result as their victims. Blood must flow, Ahati blood."
 ahati_events.160.a:0 "Those Ahati, they are the true "dogs"!"
 ahati_events.160.b:0 "We must concentrate on the larger threat, we cannot quell each fire."


 ahati_events.170.t:0 "Rise of Aakheta"
 ahati_events.170.d:0 "The horns were blown, the banners raised and the swords unsheathed. The grand master of the Ahati and instigator of this wretched betrayal, Hazan the Vengeful, stood in front of his men in full armour and declared:\n\n"My brothers, I stand here before you with a promise, a promise by which I will live or die! No longer will we be subjects of Stewards who do not steer, no longer will we be denizens of pompous monarchs who do not govern, no longer will we be lackeys to rulers who do not rule these lands with the respect and care it deserves! Men, we will, blessed by Aakhet, take up the mantle of Stewardship and cast off the suffocating cloak that was forced upon us by the Elikhetist and Nirakhetist kings. No longer will we follow Stewards, we will be Stewards! Gather your weapons and be ready, for we go to war. For the Sorrow, for Aakhet!".\n\nThe shouting and chanting of the Ahati swept over the cities and lands, and each and every denizen of the Sorrow knew what was about to come: a war for the soul, faith, and stewardship of the Sorrow. A war like no other before was unleashed. A war between Cat and Dragon, between Khet worshipper and Dragonsworn.\n\nCoordinated by their generals, the Aakhetists in the delta started to march on the remaining centres of power still loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Within a single day they seized the entire region, alongside other pockets of the realm where they established themselves. They are committed to the full annihilation of our state and to the complete takeover of our realm and powers. They claim stewardship for themselves. We must deny them this, even though it may cost us everything. This war will be long, bloody and painful, yet we cannot let a single stronghold, fort, barrack or otherwise Ahatiloyal remain. We must destroy them root and stem and force the survivors into eternal loyalty to us, the true Stewards of the Sorrow. We march to war. For the Sorrow, for the Khet!"
 ahati_events.170.a:0 "Kill these rebels, for we are the true Stewards of the Sorrow!"
 ahati_events.170.b:0 "For Aakhet!"

 ahati_events.171.t:0 "Steward Triumphant"
 ahati_events.171.d:0 "Their armies have been squashed, their swords broken, and their support dissipated. The Ahati, after years of struggle, have met their end. No longer shall they poison our lands with their lies and their threats. No longer shall the cult of Aakhet burn through our lands and kill the innocents.\n\nThe last of the Ahati were defeated near Anarat, having held out in a decrepit ruin with the last of their generals. On the run, but with nowhere to go, they decided to fight until the last man fell, their bodies pierced by bullets, spears, and the wrath of the Steward.\n\nAnd so, peace may return to the land as we round up the remaining dissidents and prepare for the trials. We will not massacre each and every one of the Ahati, as to prevent their kin from seeking vengeance. We will show them the mercy and honour they lost with their foolish aggression against the steward. Justice will be served, peace will return to the lands, and freedom and security will be a guarantee once more!"

 ahati_events.172.d:0 "A massive crowd gathered on the central market square of Kheterat. In the capital of their vanquished foes, the entire leadership of the Ahati Brotherhoods gathered for the declaration of victory. Standing on a podium, which was normally used for state announcements, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] began to speak:\n\n"Fellow denizens of the Sorrow, remember this day! The day on which the true Stewards of the Sorrow, the followers of the great Bronze Dragon Aakhet, assumed their role as protectors of the people's freedom, the guardians of peace and the deliverers of justice and security. This day will go down in history as the day the Dragonsworn liberated the people from the chains, brought upon you by the kings of Kheterata. There will, from now on, be true order, true justice and true freedom. All who can fight, will get fame, all who can work, shall get renown, and all who show honour, shall be immortalised! Do not fear us, for the Ahati are here to serve the people, to guide the people, to enlighten the people! We will bring you all much. In our new realm there will be…"

We must not only find him, we must also bring him back to the Sorrow so he can guide us in the most difficult task of Stewardship. Our mission will be costly and hard, yet the resources and connections we now possess should help us along very nicely. For Aakhet we shall look, so we may fight alongside Aakhet once more!"

 ahati_events.180.d:0 "It was at the first military tribunal for Ahati prisoners that He returned. The court was being held in an outdoor forum so citizens could see justice be done. Before proceedings could even start, though, one peasant broke from the crowd and strode towards the chained Ahati. Right before the peasant reached the stand, and before guards could catch him, a whirlwind of flames engulfed him, and in a moment he had transformed into the towering figure of Aakhet. The Ahati began to fall to their knees, but before their knees hit the stone, a plume of flame turned all three to ash.\n\n"Fools," the deep voice of Aakhet grumbled. "If you truly believed in your convictions, you would have retreated and formed your own kingdom, not grovelled for mercy." The great dragon scanned the crowd before spotting you. "Hah, you live," cried Aakhet, and in a second whirlwind of flames, shrunk back down into the familiar human form you had known your entire life. He marched towards you and embraced you with one arm, with such strength that you felt all air leave your lungs.\n\n"I knew you would emerge victorious. I spent some time disguised among the Ahati, and for all their numbers, they completely underestimated their foes. They were not the Ahati of old, back when I led them to glory in Bulwar. An army is only as strong as the one who leads it." He placed a hand on your shoulder and looked you up and down. "But you have that strength. You may be the finest mortal to rule the Mother's Sorrow. It would be my honor to guide you, as I did with the [Root.GetName] leaders of yesteryear.""
 ahati_events.180.a:0 "Glory to Aakhet! Glory to [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"

 ahati_events.200.t:0 "Stay of Execution"
 ahati_events.200.d:0 "The last of the rebels have been put on trial. And to prevent any new rebellion, changes were made. The Ahati have been reorganised to prevent the dragonsworn veterans from wandering the lands and causing trouble, with some strict rules that is. We are now in full control over the brotherhoods and their members swear an oath of loyalty, not to Aakhet or the Sorrow, but to us directly instead. They will be loyal to us until the end of days, and in exchange, they will be given small pieces of land and lower titles again. They will be employed by and through the state.\n\nWith this civil conflict over, can we finally focus on important matters of state again. We can restore our sphere of influence, reconnect with our Medasi and Satrapies, and restore the lands of the Sorrow to their former glory and prosperity. Peace is upon us!"

 mandate_mt_anarat_desc:0 "Innumerable starlit desert caravans converge outside Anarat, the resting place. At Anarat's heart, the so-called "indoor trade" of the city's six separate river markets offers any product one could name, while beyond the oft-rebuilt walls of the city-proper a thousand rickety caravanserais rattle in the wind. Each of them is flanked in turn by tented merchants selling provisions, travelling gear and star charts - the "outdoor trade".\n\nThese two great sources of wealth have often battled one another, struggling for recognition and authority, but they need not do so. We should regularise the river markets, roofing one or two to create luxury concourses, and sponsor permanent state-owned brick caravanserais at each of the major municipal gates with formal, spaced plots. The endless hidden wealth of the desert will be gathered here, as one's hands cup the sand."

 mandate_mt_gnome_scribes_title:0 "Gnomish Scribes"
 mandate_mt_gnome_scribes_desc:0 "Our gnomish population at the very mouth of the Sorrow have long become a part of our society, albeit an unusually urbane, literate and well-educated part. Administration on the delta has been greatly eased by such a large population of literate clerks, and we could greatly benefit from introducing gnomish communities elsewhere, in smaller regional towns, with specific corporate protections and guarantees of state employment. Not only could these clerks aid in making routine administration more efficient, but they can help us implement government policy even when the local nobility proves resistant."

 mandate_mt_waters_life_title:0 "Waters of Life"
 mandate_mt_waters_life_desc:0 "It is not enough simply to hold the Sorrow from source to delta - we must also defend it, guard it with our lives. Rulers of the Sorrow fall when they grow complacent in their duty, when the empty desert horizon ceases to inspire the proper respect and wariness. Large communities, well-defended and provisioned, will be the key to our continued rule of the river."

 mandate_mt_steward_title:0 "Steward of the Sorrow"
 mandate_mt_steward_desc:0 "It is one thing to claim a throne and quite another to rule. This is true of even the most primitive desert clan, yet alone the Stewardship. We must begin to reassert the Sorrow as the very centre of this world, the fulcrum around which it might be moved. The favour and support of the Khet lies always in a tricky balance with the authority and support base of our temporal state."

 mandate_mt_subjugate_medasi_title:0 "Subjugate the Medasi"
 mandate_mt_subjugate_medasi_desc:0 "Empires on the Sorrow have long cultivated loyal buffer states to extend their reach; ever since the Gnollish cataclysm, however, these subjects have been lost to us. Let us remind these breakaway children exactly from where their power flows, and reestablish our Medasi in the south."
 mandate_mt_subjugate_medasi_tooltip:0 "Will be converted into a §YMedasi§! subject for free"

 mandate_mt_new_kheterata_title:0 "A New Kheterata"
 mandate_mt_new_kheterata_desc:0 "The Sorrow sings. Foreign dignitaries recount a trip to the source as the highlight of their lives. Fishing rafts bedecked with Khet-blessed hauls drift sedately past the river-palaces of the rich, the sole interruptions to a stark, endless horizon. But then one reaches the city, and noise and scent and wealth take over, and one realises one has reached the centre of all things. We no longer merely aspire at Stewardship, but exemplify it. It is time not just to equal our ancestors but to exceed them."
 mandate_mt_new_kheterata_tooltip:0 "For as long as we have this timed modifier, enacting §YSteward Reforms§! will §Grefund the stability§! cost"

 mandate_mt_greatest_empire_title:0 "Greatest of Empires"
 mandate_mt_greatest_empire_desc:0 "We who have inherited the most ancient of titles have become accustomed to view ourselves as restorers, yet no Empire on this river has ever equalled what we have now built - the core of the world, its beating heart, unrivalled in wealth, authority and influence. Our centres of learning are the envy of all, our monuments symbols in and of themselves for the endeavours they were built to fulfil. The era of the Khet is upon the world."


 #1 kheterata
 mandate_mt_kheterata_rebellion_title:0 "Crush the Rebellion"
 mandate_mt_kheterata_rebellion_desc:0 "Just as the stomach does not rule the brain, clergy and officers do not belong on thrones. We have not ruled Kheterata for so long by coincidence, regardless of what a priest or a soldier may believe. Authority must be reasserted - as the Sorrow is at the centre of all things, so must the dynasty be."

 mandate_mt_kheterata_kheterat_title:0 "Kheterat, First City"
 mandate_mt_kheterata_kheterat_desc:0 "The Sorrow is the middle of the world, and Kheterata in turn is its middle. This Elikhet saw when he placed the first bricks of our glorious capital, a city so steeped in history that the humblest of neighbourhoods can regale a traveller with tales going back thousands of years. Through new building projects, reorganisation and commemoration we can write yet another chapter of the First City's story."

 mandate_mt_kheterata_colonies_title:0 "Ancient Colonies"
 mandate_mt_kheterata_colonies_desc:0 "Like the Sorrow itself, we return in the end to the sea. In ancient days Elikhet crossed the Divenhal to extend the mastery of his Empire, and so too will we again assert our authority. We will remind our distant children of their true ancestry, and bring them back into the fold."

 mandate_mt_kheterata_influence_title:0 "Kheteratan Influence"
 mandate_mt_kheterata_influence_desc:0 "The Damerians to the west have long claimed that their brief successes against us, long subsumed in history, are proof of their superior stake to civilisation. They are like children who win at cards and think themselves cleverer than their betters. We will show that civilisation has its proper order, and correctly subject the fringe to the centre."


 #1 nirat
 mandate_mt_nirat_faith_triumphs_title:0 "Faith Triumphs"
 mandate_mt_nirat_faith_triumphs_desc:0 "The river wears away the rock. The rock, having served its purpose, is no more. This we recognise in the crumbling Crodamos dynasty, whose teetering administration has already ceded immense tracts of land to enemies of our people. Their ignorance of the Divine Mother can no longer be brooked; it is time to assert a new holy government and a state in harmony with her will."

 mandate_mt_nirat_nirat_title:0 "Nirat, High Temple"
 mandate_mt_nirat_nirat_desc:0 "Faithful from across the watershed flock to our capital Nirat, at once temple, fortress and city. Our holy state begins here. We will clear out the slums and replace them with dormitories of the faithful. New pilgrim hostelries and artisanal districts will be delineated and built. We will renew the Grand Temple at the heart of our city and extend the concentric rings of planned streets which flank it. We will build an ordered capital to stand at the centre of all things, under our Mother's divine gaze."

 mandate_mt_nirat_prepare_priests_title:0 "Prepare the Priests"
 mandate_mt_nirat_prepare_priests_desc:0 "The dormitory-complexes of our holy capital are not merely the houses of our priesthoods - they are also barracks, college and armoury. In the doctrinal halls of our Grand Temple we have articulated a new doctrine of war in the name of Nirakhet, one which exhorts the faithful to make war in defence of the truth. Every priest will be a general, and every general a priest, until all under the sky sing the praises of our mother."

 mandate_mt_nirat_divine_mother_title:0 "The Divine Mother"
 mandate_mt_nirat_divine_mother_desc:0 "Blessings to Nirakhet who alone bore the divine, as she is with me from my conception, as she is now, as she will be in the hour of my death. Her lantern lights the way to birth and to death, from source to delta, from beginning to end. She is the substance of our homeland, the water of life, the stuff from which Elikhet was made. She is comfort: she rocks the child to sleep, she holds the hand of the dying soldier, she weeps with those left behind. Let her Sorrow fall only upon those who spurn her. "
 mandate_mt_nirat_divine_mother_tooltip:0 "Every province in §YSarhal§! in either the §YTanibic§! or §YHag§! religion groups has a §Y75%§! chance to convert to §YNirakhetist§!"


 #1 aakheta
 mandate_mt_aakheta_service_title:0 "In Service to Aakhet"
 mandate_mt_aakheta_service_desc:0 "To dismiss Aakhet as a mere invader is a failure of judgement typical to the cosseted priests and rulers of this land. We recognise Him for what He was and is - the embodiment of righteous authority, the reincarnation of Elikhet himself. We will prepare for His return by bringing the land under the rule of His servants."
 mandate_mt_aakheta_service_tooltip:0 "§YAakhet§! is with us"
 mandate_mt_aakheta_service_tooltip2:0 "All our §Yheretic subjects§! and their §Yprovinces§! will convert to §YAakhetist§!"

 mandate_mt_aakheta_aakheta_title:0 "Aakheta, Dragon Throne"
 mandate_mt_aakheta_aakheta_desc:0 "Our city is the seat from which Aakhet ruled, and it will be his capital once more. We Ahati are disciplined and unified, well-poised to build a capital for Kheterata along strict lines of efficiency. Mimicking the tessellation of dragonscale, we will build a city of self-contained neighbourhoods and maintained streets, and prepare our people for the wars required to reassert Aakhet's rightful authority."

 mandate_mt_aakheta_ashes_title:0 "Return to Ashes"
 mandate_mt_aakheta_ashes_desc:0 "In the claim to uninterrupted history, the Bulwari are perhaps the most brazen. Thousands of years of collapse and fragmentation and discord are handwaved away as continuous civilisation; the Bulwari states always return, or so they say, the phoenix from the ashes. Absurdity. With dragonfire, we will once again make ash of the Bulwari - ash which will carry away on the wind, never to reform. Aakhet's wings will once again shadow the great expanse of his ancient dominion."

 mandate_mt_aakheta_under_wings_title:0 "Under His Wings"
 mandate_mt_aakheta_under_wings_desc:0 "What is authority? Aakhet. What is Aakhet? Authority. His left wing extends across Khetarata, his right across Bulwar. Through his righteous return our people have been galvanised, restored to greatness, all the better to extend our master's reach. He has come upon Halann and with his four feet taken possession, and as his loyal followers we prosper in his favour."


 #1 koroshesh
 mandate_mt_koroshesh_nisetataa_title:0 "The Nisetataa"
 mandate_mt_koroshesh_nisetataa_desc:0 "It is said that the workshops of the gnomish lapidarists are windowless, for even the gentlest sea breeze can disturb the crafting of the Nisetataa, the perfect kingdom-jewel. These gems allow for magical work of extraordinary precision, and are so precious and expensive that their purchasers often send fleets to escort their delivery. Countless secondary industries support and maintain this singular trade; now that we rule ourselves, we can truly invest in this prized export, and bring Koroshesh to the prominence it deserves."

 mandate_mt_koroshesh_koroshesh_title:0 "Koroshesh, Shining Jewel"
 mandate_mt_koroshesh_koroshesh_desc:0 "For centuries our city and its Grand Library have been a centre of learning and exchange. We have never hidden behind endless stretches of desert or cowered behind shields - instead the mouth of the river has hungered for knowledge and experience. We will no longer see our wealth disappear inland, our blended city condemned as decadent for the very tolerance and vitality which makes it rich. Instead, this will be a place of tree-lined boulevards, fabulous marinas and villas of a hundred fashions. Across Halann even our enemies will be forced to admit that there is a good life to be had in Koroshesh."

 mandate_mt_koroshesh_divenhal_title:0 "Control the Divenhal"
 mandate_mt_koroshesh_divenhal_desc:0 "The people of the Sorrow are a water people, of course, and no civilisation could exist here without intimate manipulation of its flow. Still, past Stewards thought only of what went from source to delta; for them, all commerce, culture and knowledge dissolved into the sea at the mouth of the Sorrow. We will rectify this mistake, and master the salt water as thoroughly as we have the sweet. In doing so, we will create an empire of trade fit to dominate the eastern Divenhal."

 mandate_mt_koroshesh_wealth_title:0 "Wealth Beyond Measure"
 mandate_mt_koroshesh_wealth_desc:0 "We have always looked outward where our rivals looked inward, eyeing the wide world for opportunities like a canny haggler at market. In so doing we have created a network of wealth that crosses not only our continent but two oceans. This network is sturdier than a network of blood, for it binds us in mutual gain; one parts a man more easily from his liege than his wallet. With our thousand connections, we will harvest the crop of wealth from every port on Halann."
 mandate_mt_koroshesh_wealth_tooltip:0 "Gain a §Ypermanent claim§! on every §Ycoastal center of trade§! in §YSarhal§!"
