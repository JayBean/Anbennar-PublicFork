 establish_ahati_reform_emperor:0 "Establish the Ahati"
 establish_ahati_reform_desc:0 "The Ahati, composed of powerful military brotherhoods in the north, and influential merchant-warrior brotherhoods in the south, are often considered upholders of the mandate. Due to this their influence reaches all across the Mother's Sorrow; so much so that both they and a common citizen will consider them equal to nobility. Upholding virtue, justice, and proper rule, they will be vigilant enforcers of our whim and that of the Khets. On the other hand should we demonstrate ourselves to be unfit for the throne, it will be neither their first nor last regicide."

 lessons_aakhet_reform_desc:0 "Aakhet the Bronze: Where he walked, the earth trembled both from his footsteps alone, and multiplied by the legions behind him. Spending much of his time living in human form as we mortals do, he led Kheteratan armies to Bulwar and expanded the borders of the Khet as far as Azka-szel-Azka under his command. By emulating warriors of old, those who served the great dragon, we can make legionaries out of our regiments. May Aakhet guide their blades."

 lessons_dameria_reform_desc:0 "When one speaks of the empires of antiquity, one that often shines above the rest is the Damerian Republic, and for good reason. This massive empire stretched across the Dameshead, even controlling the Mother's Sorrow. Since then, we've assimilated and mastered their ability to administer large swaths of land. Now our government works better than ever, from the state to local level. Every corner of our empire will feel the blessing of the Mandate."

 unite_brotherhoods_reform_title:0 "§JUnite the Brotherhoods§!"
 unite_brotherhoods_reform_desc:0 "Since the time of Aakhet, the brotherhoods of the Ahati have been divided into the northern and southern brotherhoods. While the warriors of the north have served us well, and the merchants of Irsmahap, or the southern Sorrow, have too, the division of the two has too long been a strain on our administration. Rather than having to appease one or the other, we can simply unite them once more and let the Mandate, and its enforcers, stand in unity."
 unite_brotherhoods_reform_tooltip:0 "\n§WThe §YNorthern§! and §YSouthern§! Brotherhoods will be merged together. This will enable the §WSupport the Brotherhoods§! privilege, which combines the effects of both related privileges.§!"

 dragonfire_reform_emperor:0 "Create Dragonfire"
 dragonfire_reform_desc:0 "The advent of the cannon came with great machines of bronze. This surely was a sign that we were destined to use this power to expand the borders of the Khet as Aakhet did. We can take these bronze destroyers and take them to the next level, by putting powder in the barrel so that when the cannonball fires it appears as if it was done so by a dragon. Creating large billows of smoke and a blazing cannonball, this will be a fearsome tool in war."

 establish_medasi_reform_title:0 "Establish the Medasi"
 establish_medasi_reform_desc:0 "The influence of the Khet has always reached far from the Mother's Sorrow, even if they are constrained to its beautiful shores. As our borders too expand, this develops an increasing strain on the part of our administration that is directly under the Khet. Established to expand the Kheteratan hold on the continent, such as Horashesh in the past, the Medasi will serve us faithfully. They will be able to autonomously function while serving the whim of the Khet, as the Mandate intended."

They are expected to fend for themselves, yet they fall under our protection. Given that they often border more powerful entities, it seems only right that they should be given what they need to raise sufficient banners to pose a threat to outside nations. The Medasi Legions will be second only to our own."

Perhaps, as our Mandate is strengthened and our administration expanded, these scholars appear to in fact be not just notable but common in those regions and we simply hadn't noticed before. Regardless, they are becoming increasingly frequent and as our Medasis advance so do we."

 medasi_trade_reform_desc:0 "The Mandate is the right to rule, it is the authority of the Steward over the Sorrow. As such, our control of the Mother's Sorrow has also fortified our authority over our Medasis and it only stands to reason then that they should rely on us more as we rely on them. By restricting foreign trade from their borders, and some of our own, we can solidify this relationship while expanding all markets under our influence. A market for the Khet, under the Khet."

Those lands that paid tribute to us can now do so in the form of taxes, as a part of our state.

However, some can not handle their presence so often! Perhaps it would then be better to make them even grander, more superfluous, though this would take more time to prepare. The barges may be less frequent, but they'll be more pleasurable than ever!"

 mend_broken_reform_desc:0 "Oh great Eldkhet, our people have bled for you as they always have, but a history of conquest has paid its toll, and the people are weary. Some, try their best, can not even hold a sword anymore though they try! Perhaps then the powerful Khetarch could grant them renewal, to worship and serve you better for the rest of their lifetime; to mend their broken bones and allow them to wield sword once more."

The Steward, who has served you faithfully, beseeches the Khetarch for just a grain of their knowledge, so that they can better serve you and fulfil your wishes.

To that end, all believers in the Mandate can celebrate the Day of the Khet, a united holiday amongst all our people! This holiday will be filled with luxuries and pleasures, so that we may celebrate with the Khet!"

 taste_magic_reform_emperor:0 "Taste of Magic"
 taste_magic_reform_desc:0 "Halann is a world of magic and power. From the mages of Arakeprun in the west, to Verkal Ozovar in the east, magic has shaped societies. The Steward of the Sorrow should then too be able to wield such a mighty tool, and luckily the Khet have seen it the same way. They have decided to gift the Steward's bloodline with a taste of magic, so that they may enforce the Khet's will with a tool of nature."
 taste_magic_reform_tooltip:0 "\n§WOur §YRulers§! and §YHeirs§! have a higher chance to become §YPowerful Mages§!. They will also learn §Yone additional School of Magic.§!§!"

 starfall_reform_desc:0 "People often say you'd do best not to stare into the night sky for too long or too hard, there's even rumors it's the hobby of lunatics. Even so, one must appreciate its beauty from time to time; that beautiful danger. To a Khet of course, it's merely beauty. To them, a damestear shower is a matter of will and not luck. Perhaps then they can be so gracious as to will the occasional shower in a particular spot for us to harvest."

A great five cities concept is common in Sarhal, it is so in Khetapera and so in the Suran, yet these do not compare to the great five of Kheterata. These metropolises are the heart of Kheterata as they pump trade through its veins, and those views are as majestic as the phoenix of Bulwar. Down the Mother's Sorrow these are cities of the Khet."

 feed_land_reform_desc:0 "Often the Mother's Sorrow is the object of admiration for trade, for the Khet, for its cities, but people frequently forget just what its true strength is: food. Let us remind them now, the Mother's Sorrow grows grain and provides water for livestock aplenty, enough to feed all of Kheterata and more. By focusing on producing food and spreading it across the land we will demonstrate the strength of the Mandate in full stomachs and happy people."

These fertile banks could produce these goods in abundance, traders from across the Divenhal would turn their boats to Kheterata the moment they heard of our stock. We will demonstrate the strength of the Mandate with a full treasury and wealthy people."

Why should our borders stop where the Akasik ends? Why should the Khet be limited to Halcann? Let us look to the seas now, beyond Akasik, to reveal the Mandate to a new world."

 build_academy_reform_desc:0 "The Ahati still think fondly of the days of Aakhet's reign, seeing him as the ideal chosen, one who ruled with both wisdom and strength.
