 eordand.3.d:0 "With the conquest and destruction of Pelodard, the Domandrod Fey have lost their most loyal subjects. A message arrived in your palace in the midst of the night upon your table, written on a curious silky paper and with gracefully curving script. Despite the beautiful penmanship and sweet words, they are outraged by your actions, demanding your presence and explanation for your actions. Their call is not one to be denied. \n\nYou travel from Arakeprun with a small entourage, ready for the long journey to the Domandrod. You pass from the grandeur of Spring Court cities to the hinterlands in the east. Here the trees grow thick, and civilization sparse. Watching from above on the treetops, the Peitar look at you accusingly. Your loyal guards look around suspiciously with polearm and bow ready in hand, primed for threat to your person. But harm never comes to you, and before long even the homes of the Peitar dissapear into the deep forest of the Domandrod. The air is still and the glades calm, but all feels as tense as a drawn bowstring. Your journey is not over yet, but in this moment you hesitate and ponder over yourself. What is it you truly want, what is guiding your actions? It cannot be a mere whim that you wake every day, every day that you command the fates of countless souls? \n\nYou command your caravan to stop for a rest by a small spring glistening from the sunlight that has pierced through the twilight of the Domandrod. While the camp is set up you walk over to the pond with your personal guard Nestrin. You gaze into the still but clear water disturbed only by placid butterflies, you gaze into your reflection and truly realize who you are. \n\nThen you see in the reflections of the water an enchantingly beautiful woman draped in vines and a crown of rose thorn. Turning around, you see a monstrously huge man with a grotesquely horned mask, like a mass of antlers in every direction. The woman speaks to you with an unnerving smile. \n\n"What have you seen in the pool? Not all who enter the forest come here, but those who do always have a guilty conscience. I know that you are a leader most powerful, that your every word is one that carries great weight. So tell me, O great leader, what words will you say today? What will you say to justify your crimes?"

Although many of the buildings and towers are collapsed in the bowels of the earth, they still hold marvels inside that have made our expedition well worth it.

For years now the ruins of Cadcimn unearthed miracles that have enriched your city in Eordand, and you eagerly anticipate further news from the expedition. You feel a tug in your mind, a hunch, and turn around. Behind you is a shadowy figure, contrasted against the magical lights bathing your balcony. Clutched in its tenebrous hands you see a small but wickedly shaped dagger. \n\n"Are you prepared to answer for your crimes?," a graven, solemn voice utters.

Along the coast of Letih, fishermen found tiny glimmering clasts of some mineral compound among the sands some hundred years back. In my silken nightrobe I roused the court, and ordered an investigation into this legend. True enough, after extensive dredging of sand, more of these substance was found: none other than Damestear itself. But most importantly, the source was found, a buried ruin beneath the sands. Inside a long forgotten chamber was used by the Precursors to summon forth Damestear into our very own land. Although the art long defunct, the latent power of this facility can still be utilized to extract some Damestear, as long as energy still remains."

Swearing an oath to bring back the heretics to the Fey Lords, Pelodan the First lead the united Peitar people on a holy crusade. He failed in his mission, and confidence was forever lost in the Oathsworn, leading to even the Peitar peoples splitting off into different states. Since then, Pelodan's descendants have clung to the past glory and infamy attached to their name, nostalgic of a victory that could have been.

 eordand.10.d: "The ownership of Colltin has been a contentious debate between Pelomar and Sidpar, with both sides only agreeing that a decision must be made. This parcel of seemingly worthless land is nonetheless important to Pelomar, as it is unconnected to the venerated Domandrod. \n\nSources within Sidpar whisper that they be willing to give Colltin to us. Sidpar has struggled against the Summer Court realms, and would do well to gain an advantage against them. Should we offer them a deal, offering them support in eradicating the Summer heretics of Dearktir? Or should we simply demand the land, in their weakness they may not be willing to turn down any alliance with us."

 eordand.11.d: "Colltin is a ruined forest beset with rot and hated abominations from continued warfare in previous years between Pelomar and Sidpar. There is one quality that lifts it above worthlessness: the Colltin is the last area of land before entering the forbidden Domandrod. All Peitar feel a deep connection with the Domandrod and the Fey; Sidpar enjoys this connection, but our cousins in Pelomar have been long severed from the Domandrod. Now that our wars have ended and we are now allies, and we realize the pain that we have caused on our cousins, we should consider our ownership of the land. Pelomar offers us acknowledgement of our supremacy over the realms of the south along the Sarmadfar, including support in war against the heretic Caamasi, in exchange for Colltin. Should we accept this offer?"

On a recent expedition, the lands to far west have been discovered past the Broken Isles, inhabited by Ruinborn more advanced than others before. These Ruinborn approached our ships with advanced vessels of their own craft, and hailed our explorer captain to stop and rest at their fine home. The Ruinborn were quickly understood, as our shipboard scholar on Elven language was able to interpret them well enough. Calling themselves the 'Tuathak,' and the land 'Eordand,' they welcomed us to a banquet held in our honour. More alike the familiar elves than the other Ruinborn, we were quick to trust them. How wrong we were. It appears that we must have slighted them somehow, as our food was poisoned, and our ships seized. It is only by my own luck was I able to escape such a place and return to tell of this treachery, m'lord."

As is tradition, a funeral service will be done in honor of the seasons, death symbolized as returning our borrowed magical power. \n\n Will we honor the bounty of Spring by burying the body underneath a sapling, as nourishment for new growth? Will Summer be honored by returning the dead to the depths of the sea? Will Autumn's role of death in the circle of life be honored with the rot of the body? Or will Winter take precedence, with the body frozen in ice, honoring the stillness and stability of the deep winter? \n\n There is another option, that of a funeral done in the style of the Precursor ancestors. It is said that the Precursors battled fierce dragons, and that many were burnt by the draconic flames. Let us cremate the body in imitation of our ancestors."

The Silmunas were the Grand Dukes of Dameria joining the Empire of Anbennar, and were the dynasty most frequently on the imperial throne - some even viewed the Silmunas as the only rightful rulers of Anbennar. The dynasty was destroyed following the Lilac Wars, when the Grand Duchy of Dameria was dissolved after the victory of the Rose Party and the Silmunas lost their territories save for a Rose-aligned branch in Wesdam. Of the dynastic branch that once ruled the Grand Duchy, only Rogier Silmuna survived as Captain of the Sons of Dameria adventurer company.

Under the family, Lorent would become one of the most elvenized realms of Cannor, equaled only by the Grand Duchy of Dameria. Lorent remained independent of the Empire of Anbennar, though eventually a Siloriel managed to be elected to the imperial throne, sparking the Lilac Wars.
