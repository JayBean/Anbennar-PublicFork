We fought under the banner of the Moon, alongside the ancient and most-noble House of Silmuna: the Grand Dukes of Dameria. Under their rule the land would finally be at peace, but we were defeated due to the betrayal of selfish and traitorous imperial lords."

 flavor_clouded_eye.1.t:0 "Grama Clouded Eye"
 flavor_clouded_eye.1.d:0 "Grama Clouded Eye is old.\n\nShe is old enough to remember a time before Korgus lived, when the orcs still fought each other over scraps in the Dwarovar. She is old enough to remember when the Dookan first came to her in a vision, letting her know of his son's coming. She is old enough to remember when she first laid eyes on Korgus, and knew immediately that he was the Dookan's chosen child. She is old enough to remember when the Dookanson chose her as his personal shaman, and commanded her to spread the word of his coming to the rest of the orcs. She is old enough to remember the start of the Greentide, when thousands upon thousands of orcs spilled out into Escann, seeking victory and glory for the Dookan and his son... And seeking a better life for themselves and all of the orcish race, away from the poverty of the Dwarovar. And she is old enough to remember when Korgus fell, the true child of her beloved Dookan, slain by the human Corin.\n\nGrama Clouded Eye is old enough to remember all of that... And is old enough to know that her time to pass into the arms of the Great Dookan is fast approaching."
 flavor_clouded_eye.1.a:0 "Wait for me, Korgus. I'll be there with you soon."
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.t:0 "The Death of Grama Clouded Eye"
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.d:0 "She is dead. The woman who was said to have spoken directly with the Great Dookan himself in her visions, is dead. The woman who once insulted Varok Bladebreaker to his face and lived to tell the tale, is dead. The woman who rallied the disparate clans and tribes to the Dookanson's call, is dead. Grama Clouded Eye is dead, and the entire clan mourns.\n\nIt was as she lay on her death bed that she finally chose who her successor as clan chief would be. She had said that the Great Dookan himself had pointed out three exceptional young orcs to her in a vision, each exemplifying his strength in a different way, and each of which would be powerful clan chiefs in their own right.\n\nBagrum was no great warrior, and was often ridiculed by other orcs supposedly cowering behind defenses of his own construction. However, the Great Dookan knows that strength does not come only from a blade or a club. The other orcs stopped laughing at Bagrum once he saved them from a deadly charge of Cannorian knights with defenses he had hidden in the tall grass. The Dookan's children must have homes to live in and walls to protect themselves, and Bagrum would build those for his people.\n\nMeshug had always been considered soft by the other orcs. Whereas most of the Dookanson's followers were content to raid and pillage, Meshug found no satisfaction in such actions. Instead, Meshug spent hours in his tent, creating all of the things that other orcs simply stole from the lands they conquered. Why would Meshug waste so much time and effort making things, the other orcs asked, when he could just take them? Because, Meshug said, the Great Dookan is glorified not just in victorious battle, but in hard work, as well, in productive labor, to make life better for all of his children.\n\nKrunaka is the strongest warrior in Clouded Eye, able to best any male with ease. Unlike most orcs, though, Krunaka does not fight for the honor of the glory of it. No... Krunaka fights for peace. Other orcs laugh at her for it, of course. An orc that wants peace? What sort of orc is that? The Great Dookan, however, understands the strength that comes in peace, and would see Krunaka defeat the orcs' enemies and end decades of war and death.\n\nNo matter who Grama chose as her successor, the Clouded Eye clan would follow, for shaman's word was taken to be the word of the Great Dookan himself, whom none of the orcs would oppose. Who will Grama choose as the next clan chief?"
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.a:0 "Bagrum, he who seeks homes and walls for orcs."
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.b:0 "Meshug, he who seeks prosperity and wealth for orcs."
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.c:0 "Krunaka, she who seeks peace and rest for orcs."

Heaps of rubble, gravel and dirt were long visible piled along the road, but now, after several weeks, they finally disappeared. The foundations have been restored where they still existed and built anew where time had wiped them away entirely. Now the outline of the road is clearly visible. With more time and effort the roads of Jaher will be returned to their former glory and we will reap the benefits. There is still a ways to go, but it's shaping up splendidly. For now the overseers in [Root.GetName] request further funding to continue the project."

Over the last few weeks the foundation of rubble and gravel has been bound together and reinforced with a layer of cement, turning the path into what can start to truly be described as a road.

 gerudia.1.d:0 "In the years following Bjarnrík's ban of raiding, Revrhavn has become the principal port of raiders from the Dalr valley. Revrhavn was already the preferred port of Reavers, allowing for vast hoards to be kept lawfully. Although allowed by a provision from the crown, many Revrhavnic fear that their way of life is being threatened.\n\nA council of the most influential Reavers, merchants and burghers have convened during the invasion of Obrtrol to decide what can be done. Some say that we should directly demand autonomy and privileges from the King Sven II Bjarnnson, while others are cautious and warn that antagonizing him will bring us ruin. What should we do, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 gerudia.1.a:0 "Confront King Sven II Bjarnnson, he must hear our demands!"

They cite that the kingdom of Bjarnrík has encroached upon their ancient and sovereign way of life, and they think that they can dare make such demands during wartime against our primordial enemies, the Trolls. Little do they know that it is in our best interests to maintain friendly relations with outside nations, and that Revrhavn's right to raid is well protected under our laws and clauses. \n\nHow should we deal with these insubordinates, my liege?"

 gerudia.3.d:0 "Our officials have arrived in the city-temple of Skaldol and begun conversing with the Skalds on what can be done. Many of the Skalds have recited ancient tales as talking points or even as direct proof of their opinion, but others remain grounded and aware of the political reality faced. Both our representatives and the Skalds agree that something must be done to contain the Gray Orcs of Frozenmaw, and combat the Alenic peoples, most notably the Gawedi. Some suggest the Council of Skalds should unite with Bjarnrík like in the time of Bera, while others claim that no authority is above the Skalds and that their independence is paramount. \n\nWhat proposal should our diplomats suggest? According to ancient law the Skalds should be subservient to the Konungr, if they will not listen then they forfeit their right to their lands. The decision lies to you, Konungr."

Say, we have a proposal for you. It's not fair that only you should enjoy such delicacies, why don't we throw a grand party for everyone! You wouldn't have to pay a single coin, we'll provide for it! We've got some very special draughts, they'll really rouse them up, and maybe they'll even put a little more gusto in their daily lives!' \n\nAnother nymph speaks up, a rather morose one.

I thought it would be proper to inform you of my actions. Someone must be killed, someone of great value to you.

The Silmunas were the Grand Dukes of Dameria joining the Empire of Anbennar, and were the dynasty most frequently on the imperial throne - some even viewed the Silmunas as the only rightful rulers of Anbennar.\n\nThe dynasty was destroyed following the Lilac Wars, when the Grand Duchy of Dameria was dissolved after the victory of the Rose Party and the Silmunas lost their territories save for a Rose-aligned branch in Wesdam. Of the dynastic branch that once ruled the Grand Duchy, only Rogier Silmuna survived as Captain of the Sons of Dameria adventurer company.

Under the family, Lorent would become one of the most elvenized realms of Cannor, equaled only by the Grand Duchy of Dameria.\n\nLorent remained independent of the Empire of Anbennar, though eventually a Siloriel managed to be elected to the imperial throne, sparking the Lilac Wars. This would result in a victory for Lorent’s Rose Party, though several duchies under cadet houses in the Bay of Wines would break away from the Kingdom’s control.

They swore fealty to our kingdom in return for protection from the gnolls, and the young prince has grown into a strong and ambitious young man. Today he has approached our officials in the capital with a radical proposal. He notes how difficult the decision to crown a foreign monarch king of Deshak was, and offers himself to be our ruler.\n\nThis is quite a bold request, and accepting it would surely lead to war with our overlords, though it may be our only chance at freedom. Likewise, he seems to have his heart set on this gamble, and we aren't quite sure what he plans to do if we reject him. Another option would be to gently turn down his offer but grant him his family's estate to do with as he pleases."

He has remained loyal, if vocal about his displeasure of our rule over his adopted kingdom.\n\nToday however, we have received worrying reports that he has petitioned our officials across the sea to crown him king of the Desha, an act that would not only undermine our own rule, but surely drag us into war. Though we are confident our loyal subjects will make the right decision, there is a nagging suspicion that they may very well take him up on his offer and rebel."
 akan_flavour.2.a:0 "Worrisome"
 akan_flavour.3.d:0 "When we destroyed the kingdom of Khasa decades ago, we were sure that we had hunted down every last member of their royal family, ensuring they wouldn't have a force to rally behind. How much of a shock it was to us then, to find that a prince had not only survived, but had gathered an army in an attempt to revive his ruined kingdom. His army swept through the old capital, seizing it within the night. Though he may have won this victory, it is but a small price to pay to see the last scion of the Khasani flayed before us."
 akan_flavour.3.a:0 "We'll correct our mistake soon."
 akan_flavour.4.d:0 "It has been but a few decades since our kingdom was destroyed, ravaged by those savage beasts from the sands. They thought us defeated, conquered...enslaved. They believed they had broken us. Today is the day we prove them wrong. The last prince of Khasa, the great lord Bashal Keskhasa, has become the new symbol of Khasani freedom, a savior promised to us by Mother Akan herself to lead us out of this dark era. At the head of an army of proud Khasani warriors, he is prepared to reclaim his kingdom and rescue his people, no matter the cost. Today, Khasa rises anew."

Today he stands at the head of a great host, promising them with vitriol and great energy that he shall restore his fallen kingdom and expel us from Akan.

Thankfully it seems his hatred towards the gnolls is greater than his hatred of us, as he has made his intention to invade the gnollish kingdom to restore his kingdom himself.

As he triumphantly takes his seat in his ancestral palace in Khasa, he surveys his realm with glee. It quickly fades as he remembers those that wronged him and his people, the fiendish gnolls and the spineless Desha, worst of all the opportunistic curs in Eborthíl.

Except today he is no longer a prince, today he becomes a king, destined to be the greatest Akan has ever seen. Khasa had fallen far, but that just means we have further to rise."
 akan_flavour.11.a:0 "This is only the beginning!"
 akan_flavour.12.d:0 "We have received word from Khasa, the young prince Bashal has become a king! In a conflict worthy of legend, he has vanquished the beasts that demolished his kingdom and cruely enslaved his people. Across Akan he is seen as a living legend, the champion of Mother Akan and the future king of all the Akani. Time will only tell what kind of lord he will be."
 akan_flavour.12.a:0 "Good for him!"
 akan_flavour.13.d:0 "We almost couldn't believe the missive when it arrived, however the seal of Khasa is unmistakable. The bold young prince, who arrogantly presented himself in Deshak to seize the throne, has instead succeeded in reclaiming his kingdom. While much of Akan worships him as a savior and a champion of their goddess, it is clear that Khasa will not go gentle into that good night."
 akan_flavour.13.a:0 "Incredible..."
 akan_flavour.14.d:0 "How. How could a lost prince, banished from his kingdom and raised in the mountains have done this? Across Akan our packmates lie dead or dying, and few that remain are without scars or grievous injury. All of the work of Viakkoc the Mighty, undone in an instant. Much of the pack now looks at us with confusion and hatred, and the future of Viakkoc is all but certain."
