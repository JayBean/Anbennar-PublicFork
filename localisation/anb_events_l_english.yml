 flavor_clouded_eye.1.d:0 "Grama Clouded Eye is old.\n\nShe is old enough to remember a time before Korgus lived, when the orcs still fought each other over scraps in the Dwarovar. She is old enough to remember when the Dookan first came to her in a vision, letting her know of his son's coming. She is old enough to remember when she first laid eyes on Korgus, and knew immediately that he was the Dookan's chosen child. She is old enough to remember when the Dookanson chose her as his personal shaman, and commanded her to spread the word of his coming to the rest of the orcs. She is old enough to remember the start of the Greentide, when thousands upon thousands of orcs spilled out into Escann, seeking victory and glory for the Dookan and his son... And seeking a better life for themselves and all of the orcish race, away from the poverty of the Dwarovar. And she is old enough to remember when Korgus fell, the true child of her beloved Dookan, slain by the human Corin.\n\nGrama Clouded Eye is old enough to remember all of that... And is old enough to know that her time to pass into the arms of the Great Dookan is fast approaching."

 flavor_clouded_eye.2.t:0 "The Death of Grama Clouded Eye"
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.d:0 "She is dead. The woman who was said to have spoken directly with the Great Dookan himself in her visions, is dead. The woman who once insulted Varok Bladebreaker to his face and lived to tell the tale, is dead. The woman who rallied the disparate clans and tribes to the Dookanson's call, is dead. Grama Clouded Eye is dead, and the entire clan mourns.\n\nIt was as she lay on her death bed that she finally chose who her successor as clan chief would be. She had said that the Great Dookan himself had pointed out three exceptional young orcs to her in a vision, each exemplifying his strength in a different way, and each of which would be powerful clan chiefs in their own right.\n\nBagrum was no great warrior, and was often ridiculed by other orcs supposedly cowering behind defenses of his own construction. However, the Great Dookan knows that strength does not come only from a blade or a club. The other orcs stopped laughing at Bagrum once he saved them from a deadly charge of Cannorian knights with defenses he had hidden in the tall grass. The Dookan's children must have homes to live in and walls to protect themselves, and Bagrum would build those for his people.\n\nMeshug had always been considered soft by the other orcs. Whereas most of the Dookanson's followers were content to raid and pillage, Meshug found no satisfaction in such actions. Instead, Meshug spent hours in his tent, creating all of the things that other orcs simply stole from the lands they conquered. Why would Meshug waste so much time and effort making things, the other orcs asked, when he could just take them? Because, Meshug said, the Great Dookan is glorified not just in victorious battle, but in hard work, as well, in productive labor, to make life better for all of his children.\n\nKrunaka is the strongest warrior in Clouded Eye, able to best any male with ease. Unlike most orcs, though, Krunaka does not fight for the honor of the glory of it. No... Krunaka fights for peace. Other orcs laugh at her for it, of course. An orc that wants peace? What sort of orc is that? The Great Dookan, however, understands the strength that comes in peace, and would see Krunaka defeat the orcs' enemies and end decades of war and death.\n\nNo matter who Grama chose as her successor, the Clouded Eye clan would follow, for shaman's word was taken to be the word of the Great Dookan himself, whom none of the orcs would oppose. Who will Grama choose as the next clan chief?"
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.a:0 "Bagrum, he who seeks homes and walls for orcs."
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.b:0 "Meshug, he who seeks prosperity and wealth for orcs."

Revrhavn was already the preferred port of Reavers, allowing for vast hoards to be kept lawfully. Although allowed by a provision from the crown, many Revrhavnic fear that their way of life is being threatened.\n\nA council of the most influential Reavers, merchants and burghers have convened during the invasion of Obrtrol to decide what can be done. Some say that we should directly demand autonomy and privileges from the King Sven II Bjarnnson, while others are cautious and warn that antagonizing him will bring us ruin.

Little do they know that it is in our best interests to maintain friendly relations with outside nations, and that Revrhavn's right to raid is well protected under our laws and clauses. \n\nHow should we deal with these insubordinates, my liege?"

Both our representatives and the Skalds agree that something must be done to contain the Gray Orcs of Frozenmaw, and combat the Alenic peoples, most notably the Gawedi. Some suggest the Council of Skalds should unite with Bjarnrík like in the time of Bera, while others claim that no authority is above the Skalds and that their independence is paramount. \n\nWhat proposal should our diplomats suggest? According to ancient law the Skalds should be subservient to the Konungr, if they will not listen then they forfeit their right to their lands. The decision lies to you, Konungr."

 gerudia.12.d:0 "The Konungdomr of Bjarnrík has seem more stable and prosperous times. In the far north of Cannor, Gerudia has always been a cold and difficult place to live. Plagued with regional warlords for most of recorded history, many Gerudians had migrated overseas during the Era of Black Ice. However, with the return of Bera Bjarnsson in 882 AA, the Dalr Valley was united for the first time under the Crown of Bera. Under her kingdom, the disparate regions of the Dalr Valley were forced to cooperate for the first time.\n\nDuring the rise and fall of Black Castanor, Bjarnrík expanded it's influence across the Giant's Grave Sea. Only concerted efforts by the plucky Reachmen stopped permanent conquest of the southern coastline, with our greatest defeat at the hands of the Serpentgarders. With Black Castanorian cooperation, the konungdomr was able to send warriors and unwanted troublemakers overseas, and enjoyed favorable trade and raiding rights as far as the Bulwari coast. However, with the fall of Black Castanor and the defeat of the Sorceror King, Bjarnrík found itself isolated and with its once valuable trade routes cut off.\n\nWithout the support of Black Castanor, the binding of the regions of Bjarnrík began to unravel. During the War of the Bears, brother was pitted against brother for the throne, nearly ending the rule of the Bjarnsson dynasty. In the end, the Sidaett-backed Totil Bjarnsson took the throne from the sitting Konungr Gunnarr. From then on, the authority of the crown dwindled and instead collected in the outlying regions, primarily Sidaett and Revrhavn.\n\nIn an attempt to modernize Bjarnrík and end the decentralized stranglehold, the act of reaving was outlawed in the early 15th century. However, from the port of Revrhavn reaving is still permitted, due to the long-standing power and wealth of it's captains. Half of Bjarnrík stands opposed to raiding and the practice of thralldom, while others profit from it. And meanwhile, brother steals land from brother, and Trolls continue to murder our people and ravage the land."

They see it as a backward practice only done by those who cannot guide their people in the most menial tasks. Meanwhile, the Blodfjellers have backed up Revrhavn, themselves depending on thralls for their mines."

However, something of doubt lingers in your mind.

Varheim and Frostbrygja are yet to openly declare, yet both have already followed our lead of ending raiding.

 fey_alignment.2.b:0 "Perhaps they could be calmed down..."
 fey_alignment.3.t:0 "A Bloody Nightmare"
 fey_alignment.3.d:0 "You awake with a chill, afraid of something unknown to you. It is not uncommon to be spooked by the darkness and what might lurk within momentarily before regaining composure, but there is something this night that urges you to caution. Rising from your bed, you reach for a candle and light it. The meagre light helps little, but as you search you notice a shadow that should be illuminated.\n\nA voice calls out to you, cold and distant yet so very close. 'Finally awake. I thought it would be proper to inform you of my actions. Someone must be killed, someone of great value to you. Blood and murder are what drives me, but what really makes it fun is letting someone chose who dies. It's your choice: hand me over a victim, or I'll choose one of my own."
 fey_alignment.3.a:0 "The safety of my realm is worth a soul..."
 fey_alignment.3.b:0 "Preposterous, I'm not handing you anything!"
 fey_alignment.4.t:0 "Questions of Loyalty"
 fey_alignment.4.d:0 "By their very nature, the Fey are capricious and fickle beings. Embroiled in constant feuds and pranks against each other, they see mortals as mere pawns that must serve their ever-changing goals. As leader of a powerful country, they expect that you pledge your loyalty to them."
 fey_alignment.4.a:0 "I pledge myself to the Seelie"
 fey_alignment.4.b:0 "I pledge myself to the Unseelie"
 fey_alignment.4.c:0 "I will not bow down, not for anyone!"
 fey_alignment.5.t:0 "An Upset Patron"
 fey_alignment.5.d:0 "For reasons unknown to you, the Fey that once called you ally and friend are livid with you and are demanding your apology for your grave misdeeds. Ever greedy and possesive for whatever they currently do not have, they demand an exorbitant compensation for your outrageous behaviour. While it might satiate them for an instant, and they might remember this gift for a day or two, the Fey will always shift their opinion of you."
 fey_alignment.5.a:0 "I will do anything, give anything!"
 fey_alignment.5.b:0 "I still don't understand what I did wrong!?"
 fey_alignment.5.c:0 "Here look, have this special brew I have, you'll like it!"
 fey_alignment.6.t:0 "Attention Seeker"
 fey_alignment.6.d:0 "The Fey are known for their extravagant and random behaviour; today a gaggling bunch of beautiful and horrifying beings have decided to party with you, helping themselves to your personal belongings. This merry celebration is cut short however, as a rather loud and especially narcissistic Fey enters the party.\n\n'Who thought to start the festivities without me! Shame on you, all of you!,' it turns their attention to you. 'You there, servant, introduce me and serve me some drink!'"
 fey_alignment.6.a:0 "And who are you? Be off."
 fey_alignment.6.b:0 "Of course, why don't you join us?"
 fey_alignment.7.t:0 "Favor of the Seelie"
 fey_alignment.7.d:0 "The Seelie, lovers of all things merry and mischevious, smile upon you. You're our favorite pet! It's high time your good behaviour is rewarded: we'd love to throw a giant party for everyone! Well, actually not everyone, of course we're not going to waste our all our best stuff with just you. Tell us your priorities, do you really expect us to make a decision?"

 fey_alignment.7.b:0 "Let them party and be merry!"
 fey_alignment.8.t:0 "Approval of the Unseelie"
 fey_alignment.8.d:0 "The Unseelie approve of your dedication to savagery and honor. You are henceforth invited to our next hunt, but first a boon of our appreciation. A powerful pawn could yours, one well in tune with the art of shedding blood. Or perhaps you would like your men to have the senses of wolves and the strength of bears?"
 fey_alignment.8.a:0 "Deeply loyal and deeply dangerous? How can I say no?"
 fey_alignment.8.b:0 "What is a little pride to the strength of an owlbear?"
 fey_alignment.9.t:0 "Wine under the Willows"
 fey_alignment.9.d:0 "Under the gently swaying boughs of a great willow you dine on sumptuous delicacies and fine wines with the company of beautiful men and women from far away. They say their gifts of food and wine are from farther abroad then them, true rarities. As the day draws to the end and the suns last rays cast shadows on the willow boughs, one of your companions offers you a last toast."
 fey_alignment.9.a:0 "Pour over some of that vintage, would you?"
 fey_alignment.9.b:0 "Oh, I've really had enough to eat tonight."
 fey_alignment.10.t:0 "Something in the Drink..."
 fey_alignment.10.1:0 "The morning after your feast under the willow is pleasant, compared to other hangovers you've had before. You ponder on your life so far, and realize that there's still much more to experience. Who knew true wisdom came from wine?"
 fey_alignment.10.2:0 "You awake the next day with heavy head and uneasy stomach, like a leaden weight weighing on and an earthquake rupturing. You have never felt so sick in your life, every moment agony... must have been the wine."
 fey_alignment.10.a:0 "I never knew I had such a talent for speechcraft!"
 fey_alignment.10.b:0 "Curses, the wine has bloated my tongue!"
 fey_alignment.10.c:0 "I could use another night like that again..."
 fey_alignment.10.dd:0 "Bah, another goggledy disaster of an eventide!"

 fey_alignment.10.f:0 "The Fey Mead should cure my ails!"
 fey_alignment.11.t:0 "More than a Stomach Ache..."
 fey_alignment.11.1:0 "Copious amounts of food are always accompanied by the discomfort of a stomach ache, but you feel oddly empowered. The meats seem to have emboldened you with the strength and spirit of the felled beast. Who knew such power existed?"
 fey_alignment.11.2:0 "You could hardly believe how much you ate last night, were it not for the excruciating pain you feel in you, coupled with the feeling of emptiness and extreme hunger. You feel as if starving, but try as you must you cannot eat anymore. Something in the food last night was not altogether well."
 fey_alignment.11.a:0 "I dare anyone to strike me down!"
 fey_alignment.11.b:0 "So... weak..."
 fey_alignment.11.c:0 "I can't let anyone know about this power..."
 fey_alignment.11.dd:0 "Someone needs to pay for this!"

 fey_alignment.11.f:0 "The Fey Mead should cure my ails!"
 fey_alignment.12.t:0 "Curse of the Child"
 fey_alignment.12.d:0 "Living so close to the influence of the Fey, it is expected that tragedy strikes more often than boons. Especially favored for their mischief are loved children, for their pranks affect both the target and bring sorrow to their family. This day they have chosen your heir for their fun, causing great grief to everyone, and most importantly you."
 fey_alignment.12.a:0 "What has happened to you!"
 fey_alignment.12.b:0 "Quick, drink this!"
 fey_alignment.13.t:0 "Return of the Lost Child"
 fey_alignment.13.d:0 "Many years ago the beloved heir of your realm was kidnapped by the fey... and now they return, as if no time had transpired, preserved in the limbo of the Fey. This would normally be a cause for celebration, but this lost child claims that their deserved position as heir has been stolen from them while they were gone, and demands that they be reinstated as the one and true heir!"
 fey_alignment.13.a:0 "Welcome back! Of course I know who you are!"
 fey_alignment.13.b:0 "I will never let some runaway cur take my nation!"
 fey_alignment.14.t:0 "Season of Gifting"
 fey_alignment.14.d:0 "The exchange of gifts is an ancient ritual, involving the sacrifice of a possession and the trust that you will receive in equal kindness. Even moreso than mortals, the Fey exchange gifts with such glee that would make children look like static and glum. Today you have received an anonymous gift. It is customary that anonymous gifts are to be reciprocated in kind by depositing a gift of your own in the woods: those who deserve it will always receive it."
 fey_alignment.14.a:0 "Thank them for the wonderful gift."
 fey_alignment.14.b:0 "It is proper to reciprocate gifts in kind."
 fey_alignment.15.t:0 "Reciprocation"
 fey_alignment.15.d:0 "You decided to claim the gift for yourself without giving anything in return, going against the ancient rules of conduct. And when rules are broken, those who made them respond gleefully. The Seelie Fey are reminding you of your debt to them, demanding far more than was given to you: the life of your child and heir must be theirs. Or, you could publicly humiliate yourself by admitting your avarice, announcing to all that you are one who can never be trusted and never gives back in return. They cackle at you while you ponder this horrible choice."
 fey_alignment.15.a:0 "I suppose a gift in kind is required..."
 fey_alignment.15.b:0 "What kind of fool accepts a gift without giving back?"
 fey_alignment.15.c:0 "I'm sure you would love this drink instead!"
 fey_alignment.16.t:0 "A Plea for Alms"
 fey_alignment.16.d:0 "The poor and homeless are a constant in every society, every day a struggle for their survival, often only alive because of the kindly donation of those fortunate. While traveling through the capital with your entourage, you pass by another unfortunate soul so alike all the rest, afflicted with the wretched curses of disease and malnutrition. She begs of you for charity of a few coins so she may eat this day, surely not a second thought for one who is decorated with the wealth of a nation. You notice that hidden behind her rags an exquisite amulet that calls out to you; you must have it!"
 fey_alignment.16.a:0 "Give the poor lady some money."
 fey_alignment.16.b:0 "Who is she to even look at me?!"
 fey_alignment.16.c:0 "Guards - seize her amulet!"
 fey_alignment.17.t:0 "Rewards of Generosity"
 fey_alignment.17.d:0 "Those who do good deeds are not rewarded in kind, but know that their actions have brought ease to those who need help the most. But today, the good deed you have done will be rewarded, for hidden behind the illusion of a poor beggar was a powerful and dreadful Fey. Your generosity will be rewarded this day with a potion most desired; a Fey Mead that may shield you, once, from the ire of the Fey and their plots. It may only be used once, but you will forever remember that your generosity may one day save your life."
 fey_alignment.17.a:0 "I pray that I may never need this."

The Silmunas were the Grand Dukes of Dameria joining the Empire of Anbennar, and were the dynasty most frequently on the imperial throne - some even viewed the Silmunas as the only rightful rulers of Anbennar.\n\nThe dynasty was destroyed following the Lilac Wars, when the Grand Duchy of Dameria was dissolved after the victory of the Rose Party and the Silmunas lost their territories save for a Rose-aligned branch in Wesdam. Of the dynastic branch that once ruled the Grand Duchy, only Rogier Silmuna survived as Captain of the Sons of Dameria adventurer company.

Under the family, Lorent would become one of the most elvenized realms of Cannor, equaled only by the Grand Duchy of Dameria.\n\nLorent remained independent of the Empire of Anbennar, though eventually a Siloriel managed to be elected to the imperial throne, sparking the Lilac Wars. This would result in a victory for Lorent’s Rose Party, though several duchies under cadet houses in the Bay of Wines would break away from the Kingdom’s control.

Another branch also rules the county of Seinathil in Esmaria, known for its musical talents more than its martial abilities.\n\nThey would be a major player in the Moon Party during the Lilac Wars, and would take on something of a leading role in Eastern Dameria after the fall of the Silmunas.

They swore fealty to our kingdom in return for protection from the gnolls, and the young prince has grown into a strong and ambitious young man. Today he has approached our officials in the capital with a radical proposal. He notes how difficult the decision to crown a foreign monarch king of Deshak was, and offers himself to be our ruler.\n\nThis is quite a bold request, and accepting it would surely lead to war with our overlords, though it may be our only chance at freedom. Likewise, he seems to have his heart set on this gamble, and we aren't quite sure what he plans to do if we reject him. Another option would be to gently turn down his offer but grant him his family's estate to do with as he pleases."

He has remained loyal, if vocal about his displeasure of our rule over his adopted kingdom.\n\nToday however, we have received worrying reports that he has petitioned our officials across the sea to crown him king of the Desha, an act that would not only undermine our own rule, but surely drag us into war. Though we are confident our loyal subjects will make the right decision, there is a nagging suspicion that they may very well take him up on his offer and rebel."

 akasik_flavour.3.d:0 "When we destroyed the kingdom of Khasa decades ago, we were sure that we had hunted down every last member of their royal family, ensuring they wouldn't have a force to rally behind. How much of a shock it was to us then, to find that a prince had not only survived, but had gathered an army in an attempt to revive his ruined kingdom. His army swept through the old capital, seizing it within the night. Though he may have won this victory, it is but a small price to pay to see the last scion of the Khasani flayed before us."

The last prince of Khasa, the great lord Bashal Keskhasa, has become the new symbol of Khasani freedom, a savior promised to us by Mother Akasik herself to lead us out of this dark era.

It quickly fades as he remembers those that wronged him and his people, the fiendish gnolls and the spineless Desha, worst of all the opportunistic curs in Eborthíl.

 akasik_flavour.12.d:0 "We have received word from Khasa, the young prince Bashal has become a king! In a conflict worthy of legend, he has vanquished the beasts that demolished his kingdom and cruely enslaved his people.

 akasik_flavour.12.a:0 "Good for him!"
 akasik_flavour.13.d:0 "We almost couldn't believe the missive when it arrived, however the seal of Khasa is unmistakable. The bold young prince, who arrogantly presented himself in Deshak to seize the throne, has instead succeeded in reclaiming his kingdom. While much of Akasik worships him as a savior and a champion of their goddess, it is clear that Khasa will not go gentle into that good night."
 akasik_flavour.13.a:0 "Incredible..."
 akasik_flavour.14.d:0 "How. How could a lost prince, banished from his kingdom and raised in the mountains have done this? Across Akasik our packmates lie dead or dying, and few that remain are without scars or grievous injury. All of the work of Viakkoc the Mighty, undone in an instant.
