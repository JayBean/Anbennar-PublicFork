 escann_intro.1.t:0 "The Sword Covenant"
 escann_intro.1.d:0 ""Auntie!" shouts a young girl wearing armor, her black hair falling on her shoulders after being played by the wind outside the tent. "They agreed! They said I passed my tests!" \n\nAn elderly, experienced knight looks at her with pride in her eyes "Of course you passed it. You are Reanna sil na Ean, princess of Farranean, my niece, and soon you will become one of the heirs of Aldresia." She smiles and walks to hug the girl; loving her like her own daughter she never had. \n\nHours pass as they celebrate the good news in their tent. Galinda had found a bottle of aged wine in one of the noble houses of battletorn ruins of Castonath during her scouting mission in the once greatest city in the world. She had hidden and preserved the bottle for a special occasion like this one. Regardless of the autumn wind outside, the inside was warm and cozy and full of joyous clinging of wine glasses. \n\nDespite her young age and that it was her first time drinking, Reanna was strong of head and clear of mind. She listened in curiosity as her aunt told her stories about her time as a squire in Arca Aldresia. The great castle sounded almost mythical in her words and Reanna couldn’t think that her aunt could’ve regretted the fact she left it. Unable to contain her curiosity, she asked "Why did you really leave?" \n\nThe silence grew tense as Galinda didn’t know what to say at first. Drops of rain hit the tent in rhythmic melody as the Captain of the Sword Covenant said "Because that’s what Aldresia would do, wouldn’t she? You know that. You studied her history. She would never reject calls for help when innocent people are being murdered by the forces of evil. Her deeds stand as the complete opposite of what the Aldresian Council did. They rejected your uncle’s plea for help, and the plea for help of the Knight Laurens, and my own plea. They stand for nothing but their own cowardice. Only we, the ones who answered, are worthy of the name Aldresia. Our duty was to help those in need, save those in danger, and fight evil. Remember those words and keep them deep within your heart." She stays silent for a moment, touches her niece's arm, and continues "We are the Sword Covenant. And once I fulfill my duty, you will be here to lead our knights. I miss the Castle, but it’s just a building. The true Castle of Aldresia is in the hearts of those who follow her values.""

 escann_intro.2.t:0 "Throwing the Dice"
 escann_intro.2.d:0 ""No sign of Lady Roche here!", the report said.\n\nReán síl na Arasúil was unsurprised. Turnmarket had been all but abandoned, inhabited only by workers and farmers on the brink of starvation, the same as every other town the House of Riches had visited. The orcs had taken the food of every town and farm they could, starving the people to feed their horde. Anyone who fought back was brutally killed.\n\nThe House of Riches went to Escann as an investment-saving venture, to reclaim what they could for their Escanni trading partners. After hiring what mercenaries they could afford and joining the Marcher Lords, they’d searched Escann for anything salvageable to no avail. There’d been no traces of either the companies or their owners. Reán thought back on Lady Roche and his other associates: all the letters, all the business meetings and parties, all the faces, now gone.\n\nThe expedition had failed. It was time to walk out of his tent, terminate his mercenary contracts and return to Damescrown. But looking at the list of those who were missing, he knew one name that hadn’t been written on it.\n\nAra. Reán had heard the goddess’ name  countless times, but had never cared for her teachings beyond knowing his lust for profits was divinely sanctioned. That was until he’d met Corin, a physical avatar of the gods. She was proof the Regent Court backed the Marcher Lords. And given so, then surely Ara, patron of risk takers and adventurers, must have had her hand in it as well. The House of Riches had chosen to take a chance on Escann when others had stayed in Damescrown, and Ara favored the bold. Could this ignominious failure really be her plan?\n\nReán recalled the thriving Escann of his memories and looked upon the desolation that had replaced it. Beyond being goddess of money and luck, Ara was the bringer of prosperity. Would they leave this place where Ara’s blessings were needed more than anywhere else? Or… would they take another chance?\n\nReán made his decision."

 escann_intro.3.t:0 "A Knight's Promise"
 escann_intro.3.d:0 "The day's still clear in my mind, the day I laid eyes on him. Just another rotten day in Anbencost, the city a wreck after the Sack. The streets were crawling with Wexonard goons and petty thugs, all itching to squeeze the last coin out of anyone not too broke to starve. To me, they were all scum, no two ways about it.\n\nI was slogging through my shift, hauling rubble in the Forgeway, when I saw the day's mark; a dwarf craftsman, ringed by a bunch of lowlifes. They were hounding him for a "protection fee," all gold, tools, and wares. A crowd had gathered, eyes wide, mouths shut. We knew the drill, knew it was messed up, but stepping in? That was asking for trouble.\n\nThen, out of the blue, this voice booms out, "Stop this at once! Leave that honest man alone!"\n\nMe and the rest of the sorry lot spun around to see a half-elf charging in. His fine robes hinted at wealth, but the shine of his silver armor underneath, bright as his hair, told another story. He wasn't some pampered noble. Shame the thugs were too thick to figure that out. They could've saved themselves from ending piled up like yesterday's trash.\n\nThe fight? A blink-and-you-miss-it affair.\n\nBut what sticks with me is what he said after, like he was singling me out from the crowd. Climbing atop the heap of defeated thugs, he stood tall and declared:\n\n"The Anbencost we knew is no more! If you stay here, you'll be a tool for the barbarian that calls himself 'emperor' or reduced to petty crime like them! Join me and my knights! We will build our city anew in a land ripe with flowing rivers and vast farmlands. Together we shall build a new Anbencost, thrice its size and in glory! And I, Thaliondir Silgarion will lead us there!"\n\nIt was a pipe dream, sure. But back then, it was the kind of dream that gave us something rare; hope. So we followed him. No second thoughts. Never regretted it. Even after things went sideways..."

escann_intro.4.t:0 "The Iron Scepter"
escann_intro.4.d:0 "The waters of Silvermere shone like a mirror, reflecting stars above Aldred's head as he contemplated the day's events.\n\n"Hard to belive, isn't it?" His advisor and friend, Ardor, said to him, "This morning, defeat seemed to be just over the horizon."\n\n"Defeat is still possible. The Dookanson's death may have weakened the Greenskins, but it did not defeat them. We should not be complacent in victory, we have come too far to fall."\n\n"All the more reason," Ardor paused for a second, prying at the edge of Aldred's wards with a suggestion cantrip. The effort failed, but Aldred feigned ignorance. "To send word to Damenath. Grand Magister Vinerick may yet forgive us and-"\n\n"No." The Magister's voice was cold as the waters beside him, but not angry, not yet. "We will not be forgiven, because we have done nothing wrong."\n\nArdor's reply was lost as the night was split by a flash of light. The older men turned to find its source. Two younger mages, engaged in a duel at the water's edge, an overseer watching them hawkishly. A second flash of light bounds forward, shattering an orcish skeleton that imposes itself between the attack and its master.\n\n"You'll need better than flares to tag me, Thal!" Called the girl. "My horde is unmatched!"\n\nThe half-elf across from her grunted in pain as he twisted his arm free from a Skeletal grab. "Twenty of your blasphemies is not a horde, Varina! Ven iraaksh!" Another flash crumpled a pair of the reanimated attackers. "These vile tricks will not save you, necromancer!"\n\nAldred smiled, and went to instructing these youths on how to properly duel. "Thal! Varina! Focus! Gloating and banter may be sporting, but war is no place for sport. Wasting breath on taunts when you need invocations is a fast way to end up dead, or worse." He looked to Ardor, who gave him a reluctant nod, "We bear the Iron Scepter! We reshape the world! Carelessness will not do."

escann_intro.5.t:0 "Taking Flight"
escann_intro.5.d:0 "“We’re not going home. Not now, maybe not ever.”\n\nThe statement was met with an eerie quiet as Jergen awaited his captains’ response. Having had adventures with them for most of his adult life, he knew how close he was to being thrown off his horse into the muck.\n\n“So this is it?” A voice in the back calls “We’re to spend our lives as Vivin’s lapdogs?”\n\nAt that the silence broke with a flood of shouts. Jabs were made at Jergen’s age, his virility, him taking potions up the other end, his lack of partner, his likeness to his own mare, that he might as well change his last name to “of sil Viv-\n\n“SILENCE.” bellowed a voice, hoarse from decades of shouting, the command obeyed by instinct. Jergen smiled in thanks at Ollore, a man so dependable he owed him his life thrice over. Buoyed by his friend’s support, Jergan again faced the crowd.\n\n“King Davan doesn’t know who he’s dealing with. But you do. You know me. You know my real target. Unfortunately, so do the true rulers of Coruvia.”\n\nA few captains hissed, others spat on the ground, the pious whispered a prayer.\n\n“The worst part? It’s not within our power to stop them. It’s not in our power to save our people. Some of you might remember the time we tried.”\n\n“But as always, I have a plan. A simple one at that.” \n\n“First, we clean up the greenskins and settle the ruins of Vernham. The Raven’s Banner means something back home, I know hundreds of families will make the short journey there.” A few cheers followed.\n\n“Then we, or perhaps our sons, will march south with never before seen strength, burning away the demon worshippers and restoring Coreveld.” The cheering grew louder.\n\n“And then we, or perhaps our grandsons, will march into Coruvia and burn every single bloodsucker - magical or mundane - retaking the land in the name of its people!”\n\nThe cheering was deafening. Jergan’s plan would see them through."
