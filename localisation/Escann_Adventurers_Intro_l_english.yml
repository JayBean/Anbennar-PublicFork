 escann_intro.1.d:0 "“Auntie!” shouts a young girl wearing armor, her black hair falling on her shoulders after being played by the wind outside the tent. “They agreed! They said I passed my tests!” \n\nAn elderly, experienced knight looks at her with pride in her eyes “Of course you passed it. You are Reanna sil na Ean, princess of Farranean, my niece, and soon you will become one of the heirs of Aldresia.” She smiles and walks to hug the girl; loving her like her own daughter she never had. \n\nHours pass as they celebrate the good news in their tent. Galinda had found a bottle of aged wine in one of the noble houses of battletorn ruins of Castonath during her scouting mission in the once greatest city in the world. She had hidden and preserved the bottle for a special occasion like this one. Regardless of the autumn wind outside, the inside was warm and cozy and full of joyous clinging of wine glasses. \n\nDespite her young age and that it was her first time drinking, Reanna was strong of head and clear of mind. She listened in curiosity as her aunt told her stories about her time as a squire in Arca Aldresia. The great castle sounded almost mythical in her words and Reanna couldn’t think that her aunt could’ve regretted the fact she left it. Unable to contain her curiosity, she asked “Why did you really leave?” \n\nThe silence grew tense as Galinda didn’t know what to say at first. Drops of rain hit the tent in rhythmic melody as the Captain of the Sword Covenant said “Because that’s what Aldresia would do, wouldn’t she? You know that. You studied her history. She would never reject calls for help when innocent people are being murdered by the forces of evil. Her deeds stand as the complete opposite of what the Aldresian Council did. They rejected your uncle’s plea for help, and the plea for help of the Knight Laurens, and my own plea. They stand for nothing but their own cowardice. Only we, the ones who answered, are worthy of the name Aldresia. Our duty was to help those in need, save those in danger, and fight evil. Remember those words and keep them deep within your heart.” She stays silent for a moment, touches her niece's arm, and continues “We are the Sword Covenant. And once I fulfill my duty, you will be here to lead our knights. I miss the Castle, but it’s just a building. The true Castle of Aldresia is in the hearts of those who follow her values.”"
