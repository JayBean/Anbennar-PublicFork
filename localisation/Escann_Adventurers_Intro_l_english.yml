 escann_intro.1.t:0 "The Sword Covenant"
 escann_intro.1.d:0 ""Auntie!" shouts a young girl wearing armor, her black hair falling on her shoulders after being played by the wind outside the tent. "They agreed! They said I passed my tests!" \n\nAn elderly, experienced knight looks at her with pride in her eyes "Of course you passed it. You are Reanna sil na Ean, princess of Farranean, my niece, and soon you will become one of the heirs of Aldresia." She smiles and walks to hug the girl; loving her like her own daughter she never had. \n\nHours pass as they celebrate the good news in their tent. Galinda had found a bottle of aged wine in one of the noble houses of battletorn ruins of Castonath during her scouting mission in the once greatest city in the world. She had hidden and preserved the bottle for a special occasion like this one. Regardless of the autumn wind outside, the inside was warm and cozy and full of joyous clinging of wine glasses. \n\nDespite her young age and that it was her first time drinking, Reanna was strong of head and clear of mind. She listened in curiosity as her aunt told her stories about her time as a squire in Arca Aldresia. The great castle sounded almost mythical in her words and Reanna couldn’t think that her aunt could’ve regretted the fact she left it. Unable to contain her curiosity, she asked "Why did you really leave?" \n\nThe silence grew tense as Galinda didn’t know what to say at first. Drops of rain hit the tent in rhythmic melody as the Captain of the Sword Covenant said "Because that’s what Aldresia would do, wouldn’t she? You know that. You studied her history. She would never reject calls for help when innocent people are being murdered by the forces of evil. Her deeds stand as the complete opposite of what the Aldresian Council did. They rejected your uncle’s plea for help, and the plea for help of the Knight Laurens, and my own plea. They stand for nothing but their own cowardice. Only we, the ones who answered, are worthy of the name Aldresia. Our duty was to help those in need, save those in danger, and fight evil. Remember those words and keep them deep within your heart." She stays silent for a moment, touches her niece's arm, and continues "We are the Sword Covenant. And once I fulfill my duty, you will be here to lead our knights. I miss the Castle, but it’s just a building. The true Castle of Aldresia is in the hearts of those who follow her values.""

 escann_intro.2.t:0 "Throwing the Dice"
 escann_intro.2.d:0 ""No sign of Lady Roche here!", the report said.\n\nReán síl na Arasúil was unsurprised. Turnmarket had been all but abandoned, inhabited only by workers and farmers on the brink of starvation, the same as every other town the House of Riches had visited. The orcs had taken the food of every town and farm they could, starving the people to feed their horde. Anyone who fought back was brutally killed.\n\nThe House of Riches went to Escann as an investment-saving venture, to reclaim what they could for their Escanni trading partners. After hiring what mercenaries they could afford and joining the Marcher Lords, they’d searched Escann for anything salvageable to no avail. There’d been no traces of either the companies or their owners. Reán thought back on Lady Roche and his other associates: all the letters, all the business meetings and parties, all the faces, now gone.\n\nThe expedition had failed. It was time to walk out of his tent, terminate his mercenary contracts and return to Damescrown. But looking at the list of those who were missing, he knew one name that hadn’t been written on it.\n\nAra. Reán had heard the goddess’ name  countless times, but had never cared for her teachings beyond knowing his lust for profits was divinely sanctioned. That was until he’d met Corin, a physical avatar of the gods. She was proof the Regent Court backed the Marcher Lords. And given so, then surely Ara, patron of risk takers and adventurers, must have had her hand in it as well. The House of Riches had chosen to take a chance on Escann when others had stayed in Damescrown, and Ara favored the bold. Could this ignominious failure really be her plan?\n\nReán recalled the thriving Escann of his memories and looked upon the desolation that had replaced it. Beyond being goddess of money and luck, Ara was the bringer of prosperity. Would they leave this place where Ara’s blessings were needed more than anywhere else? Or… would they take another chance?\n\nReán made his decision."
