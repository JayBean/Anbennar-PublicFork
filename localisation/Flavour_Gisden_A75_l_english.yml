 gisden_rebuild_the_guild_title:0 "Rebuild the Guild"
 gisden_rebuild_the_guild_desc:0 "The Guild of the Silver Cinquefoil once made potions that aided our people greatly. During the Fourth Lilac War, Arannen attacked it, pillaging whatever they could and razing the rest. The former guildhall is now little more than a pile of rubble.\n\nThankfully, the elves who manned the guild managed to flee in time. Now that peace has been established, they appear eager to return to Gisden. There is no better possible place to start our rebuilding efforts."

 gisden_cinquefoil_workshops_title:0 "Cinquefoil Workshops"
 gisden_cinquefoil_workshops_desc:0 "Word of our guild’s reliable potions has spread in Escann, and the demand for more coming from the east has grown so great that we are almost unable to meet it.\n\nDwarves from the nearby Electorate of Silverforge have offered us a deal; in exchange for building and working on workshops for the fabrication of our products, they’ve requested trade privileges and the establishment of a sizable dwarven quarter in the town of Gisden."

 gisden_imperial_city_of_gisden_title:0 "Imperial City of Gisden"
 gisden_imperial_city_of_gisden_desc:0 "Gisden has quickly grown into one of the largest settlements in the Borders. But if our ambitions are to continue without hindrance, we must secure a city charter from the Imperial Parliament. Besides meeting several requirements as demanded by Imperial Law, we will also need to earn the personal approval of the Emperor of Anbennar."

 gisden_a_county_to_be_proud_of_title:0 "A County to be Proud of"
 gisden_a_county_to_be_proud_of_desc:0 "Throughout the whole of the Empire, word spreads of the County of Gisden. Once a backwater prince of the Borders, under our leadership it has grown to be one of the wealthiest realms in the whole of Cannor, matching or even surpassing the Luna River, the Damesear, and the Bloodwine. It is truly, beyond any doubt, a county to be proud of."

 gisden_bounty_of_iron_title:0 "Bounty of Iron"
 gisden_bounty_of_iron_desc:0 "With Autumnfield returned to us, some of the neighboring Ironhills are now part of our territory. The dwarves of Gisden were eager to prospect along them and quickly uncovered large veins of iron deep beneath the earth.\n\nThey’ve told us that Gisden will need both the Wexonard’s expertise with mining iron and the Dwarves’ mastery over the earth if this bounty is to be reaped and used for our benefit."

 gisden_cardesti_secrets_title:0 "Cardesti Secrets"
 gisden_cardesti_secrets_desc:0 "With word spreading of our county’s growth, the Cardesti who visit Gisden every year were glad to see that our attitudes towards them haven’t changed in the slightest.\n\nAs a result, their gatherings at Upsfield have grown even larger, and they’ve even shared the secrets of their masterful copper metalware with a few of our dwarven craftsmen. In exchange, they’ve only asked for our aid in researching their dreadful curse."

 gisden_the_copper_road_title:0 "The Copper Road"
 gisden_the_copper_road_desc:0 "As our goods spread across the Empire, the amount of copper we have in Gisden has proven insufficient for our needs. With Verne and the Businori unwilling to sell more to us for fear of us stealing their profit, we need to resort to other methods.\n\nWe can reach Ovdal Tûngr by sea, a dwarven hold famed for its copper. If we were to build a friendly relationship with the Copper Dwarves, we could create a new road for goods hailing from Bulwar and beyond, bypassing the Isle of Tef."

 gisden_beneath_wex_shadow_title:0 "Beneath Wex's Shadow"
 gisden_beneath_wex_shadow_desc:0 "We paid the price for our independence in blood. But a large part of the merit certainly rests upon the shoulders of the Grand Duchy of Wex and Lothane síl Wex, who fiercely supported us against Arannen.\n\nWith tensions between former Rose and Moon party members lingering, we must rely upon our Wexonard ties, find shade under Wex’s towering shadow, and, if necessary, even play the role of the faithful lapdog."

 gisden_ties_that_bind_title:0 "Ties that Bind"
 gisden_ties_that_bind_desc:0 "Our alliance with Wex has slowly shifted from a one-sided guarantee to a more mutually beneficial arrangement. As we work to be considered equals to the Wexonards, rumors have begun to reach our ears that the Grand Duchy is considering furthering our relations.\n\nThe Gisdenese and Wexonards have often intermarried through the centuries, and there are no better pacts than ones sealed in blood."
 
 gisden_blood_of_the_alenics_title:0 "Blood of the Alenics"
 gisden_blood_of_the_alenics_desc:0 "Our ties with the Grand Duchy of Wex have swiftly grown into something greater than merely an alliance. The blood of Alenics runs in our veins, and that makes the Wexonards our brothers. As long as we stand side by side, it seems inevitable for our mutual rise to continue."

 gisden_march_to_the_divenhal_title:0 "March to the Divenhal"
 gisden_march_to_the_divenhal_desc:0 "During our recent war against Arannen, the Counties of Toarnen and Celliande supported the Marquisate with weapons and supplies, caring more about earning gold than Gisden’s plight. The time has come for them to pay for what they have done. We shall march our armies to the shores of the Divenhal and see the cities of Sorncell and Aiscestir bow before the banner of Gisden."

 gisden_the_count_of_gisden_title:0 "The Count of Gisden"
 gisden_the_count_of_gisden_desc:0 "Count Benar V possesses a scholarly bearing, often able to be found immersed in books and chronicles, and has so far been reluctant to rule over Gisden and to address the county’s growing issues.\n\nMany have begun to wonder whether Count Benar V is truly fit to rule over Gisden, especially when the county finds itself in such a precarious position. Only time will tell whether Benar will endure, or whether a new Count of Gisden will rise."

 gisden_the_treaty_of_gisden_title:0 "The Treaty of Gisden"
 gisden_the_treaty_of_gisden_desc:0 "Despite the end of the Lilac Wars, the Marquisate of Arannen has not relinquished its claims over Gisden. We once served them loyally, but they have proven themselves unsuitable as both friends and allies, and our people have grown used to the sweetness of independence. Though things appear calm in recent years, word has reached our ears that not all may be as it seems."

 gisden_shatter_the_marquisate_title:0 "Shatter the Marquisate"
 gisden_shatter_the_marquisate_desc:0 "Arannen has always thought itself the preeminent power of the Borders, and has long sought to unite all Arannese realms under a single banner. Through attaining victory over the Salt Lion, we shall prove that it is not infallible and that its days as the Marquis of the East have come to an end."

 gisden_the_council_of_criers_title:0 "The Council of Criers"
 gisden_the_council_of_criers_desc:0 "The City of Tellum is the jewel of the Arannese. Wealthy and respected, it made itself untouchable by falling under the protection of the Emperors of Anbennar. With Gisden asserting its rule over the borders, Tellum and its Council of Criers must fall under our sway, one way or another."

 gisden_hawkfields_disputes_title:0 "Hawkfields Disputes"
 gisden_hawkfields_disputes_desc:0 "The Hawkfields were taken by Sugamber during the Lilac Wars. Fertile and bountiful, they have long been the apple of Celliande’s eye. With Celliande having fallen under our rule, it is now up to us to restore the Hawkfields to their rightful master and to show the Duchy of Sugamber that there is a new power in the Borders."

 gisden_broken_wings_title:0 "Broken Wings"
 gisden_broken_wings_desc:0 "The Duchy of Asheniande has long coveted our lands, and we’ve always known they could not be trusted. Now that their lands have fallen under our sway, and with the remnants of House síl Vivin driven off, it is only proper that we take up their duties as Dukes and righteously begin our rule over the bountiful Ashfields."

 gisden_the_matter_of_teinmas_title:0 "The Matter of Téinmas"
 gisden_the_matter_of_teinmas_desc:0 "Téinmas was once part of Asheniande. Many Arannese still dwell in those lands, and it remains a point of tension between the Elfrealm of Ibevar and the Dukes of Asheniande, a title we now bear. If we are to secure our borders and truly unite our people under a single banner, the matter of Téinmas must be settled once and for all."

 #Arannese Missions
 gisden_lessons_lilac_wars_title:0 "Lessons of the Lilac Wars"
 gisden_lessons_lilac_wars_desc:0 "Having grown harsh from his days of war alongside Lothane síl Wex, Count Ostan has always been troubled by Gisden’s weakness and fraught with nightmares about its possible destruction. As the years passed, he chose to focus on military reforms in order to to prevent that dreadful future from becoming true. If Gisden is to thrive, Count Ostan said, it must ensure its army is up to the task of protecting it."

 gisden_bread_and_salt_title:0 "Bread and Salt"
 gisden_bread_and_salt_desc:0 "With Gisden now ruling over many petty princes, troubles have begun to arise regarding our legitimacy and the future of the Borders. Some of those we have conquered have proven more than unhappy about our occupation of their lands; we must show them that we are still the same people despite our disagreements. Through offerings of bread and salt, we will sway their hearts, appease their minds, and begin pushing our claim over the title of Marquis, little by little."

 gisden_quelling_enmities_title:0 "Quelling Enmities"
 gisden_quelling_enmities_desc:0 "The City of Arannen has traditionally been the center of the Marquisate of Arannen. Although Gisden shall always remain dear to our hearts, it would be good for us to quell the tensions and enmities of yesteryear and to fully integrate the nobility of Arannen into our inner circle. Some have suggested that we take measures to make Arannen into our Winter Court, until such a time that is no longer necessary, and the people of Arannen have been fully appeased."

 gisden_imperial_blessings_title:0 "Imperial Blessings"
 gisden_imperial_blessings_desc:0 "With our bid towards the position of Marquis finally publicly announced, we must ensure we have the necessary support in the imperial parliament to make our wish come true. Through forging friendships and bribing those discontent with our rising power, we will make significant progress in our goals and truly become known as the Empire of Anbennar’s shield."

 gisden_restore_the_salt_trade_title:0 "Restore the Salt Trade"
 gisden_restore_the_salt_trade_desc:0 "One of the main reasons for our rebellion against Arannen was the increased taxation on the sale of salt imposed upon us. Gisden nearly went bankrupt as a result, and our industries were ruined.\n\nRecently, the salt trade has been taken over by Beepeck and Vertesk, but with our place in the Borders secure, it is time for us to retake it from them. After reaching out, Damescrown has shown itself interested in aiding us against their rivals and to see us restored to our rightful place."

 gisden_the_eastern_bulwark_title:0 "The Eastern Bulwark"
 gisden_the_eastern_bulwark_desc:0 "Corvuria has always been the foremost dangerous threat to the eastern members of the Empire, but it is not only the Corvurians that we must be wary of. For centuries, our lands have served as a passage through which Cannor and Escann were invaded. If we are to take up the title of Marquis, we must ensure that our eastern defenses hold strong and that nothing like the War of the Pale Raven ever happens again."

 gisden_marquis_of_arannen_title:0 "Marquis of Arannen"
 gisden_marquis_of_arannen_desc:0 "With time, even the deepest of wounds will scar. After our efforts to secure our position in the eyes of both the people and the Empire, it is finally time for us to come before the Imperial Parliament and be crowned as the new Marquisate of the Borders.\n\nGisden’s people are Arannese above all; we have proven that, and it shall remain so for ages to come. No matter what threat we may face, whether it be tides of green, dragons waking from slumber, or rising witch-kings, the Marquis of the East will be ready."

 #Milcorissian Missions
 gisden_patronage_of_the_arts_title:0 "Patronage of the Arts"
 gisden_patronage_of_the_arts_desc:0 "Benar V had always preferred books over his duties. Despite having matured and grown into a respectable count, his mind always lingered upon his thirst for knowledge.\n\nOne of the foremost patrons of the Renaissance, he invested much of his personal wealth in bringing favored artists and scholars to Gisden’s court. His patronage rekindled the spirit of Gisden’s people, allowing them to finally forget the woes of the Lilac Wars."

 gisden_books_of_benar_title:0 "Books of Benar"
 gisden_books_of_benar_desc:0 "Long a scholar, Count Benar V once visited the Imperial Archives. Flustered at the amount of knowledge hoarded in Konwell, he quickly decided to begin an archive of his own within the confines of Gisden’s borders. Quintenbury, a quiet and peaceful village, was considered the perfect location.\n\nIn time, the archive’s construction would unearth knowledge that would consume the Count utterly, mind and soul."

 gisden_tower_of_varlosen_title:0 "The Tower of Varlosen"
 gisden_tower_of_varlosen_desc:0 "The Tower of Varlosen has watched over the borders for as long as anyone can recall. A structure visited by few save for the Magisterium, the decision to build a mage tower so deep in the woods of Varlosen had always been deemed strange. Now, however, we know the truth. The Magisterium had tried to keep it from us, but they failed. In the shadow of the Tower of Varlosen, we will face the magisters and uncover our people’s true destiny."

 gisden_kingly_coronation_title:0 "A Milcori Coronation"
 gisden_kingly_coronation_desc:0 "The Necropolis of Corseton was built by the Milcorissians to honor their god, Nerat. Though its purpose has been perverted and its halls occupied by priests who could care little for our people’s history, once upon a time the Necropolis was where the kings of Milcorissia would be crowned and sworn to serve Nerat and his people. Though Imperial Law states that no kings exist within the Empire, we must do as our ancient traditions bid. In the Necropolis, the ruler of our people shall be coronated."

 gisden_old_roots_title:0 "Old Roots"
 gisden_old_roots_desc:0 "With our eyes uncovered and the truth revealed, we can see the signs we had missed for so long. All around us, the roots of Milcorissia run deep, and many still call this land by its ancient name. We must dig into the earth. Ruin by ruin, piece by piece, we shall reclaim our past. The revival of our kingdom is imperative; the restoration of what was once lost is nigh. Never again shall we be deceived by lies."

 gisden_knowledge_of_the_ancients_title:0 "Knowledge of the Ancients"
 gisden_knowledge_of_the_ancients_desc:0 "The Magisterium preaches about the dangers of magic and of the chaos that would come should it be fully unleashed. The Magisterium’s words are motivated by avarice and a desire to hoard power for themselves; it is only by wielding the magic of our ancestors that we shall truly reclaim our birthright and right the wrongs done to us. In Arca Aldresia, the diaries of Morgurax gather dust. They are ours by right, and they must be returned to our hands."

 gisden_dream_of_milcorissia_title:0 "Dream of Milcorissia"
 gisden_dream_of_milcorissia_desc:0 "Our people gather around the old texts and relics of Milcorissia; our soldiers point their spears outwards for the first time in centuries; our whole realm stands united behind our common goal. As we prosper once more, the Empire finally begins to doubt our intentions. They will come for us in time, as they did before, but we shall be ready. For Milcorissia shall rise once more, and the world shall remember the days of old when it lived in fear of Morgurax, of Xamarzu, of the Lich-Kings that bowed to none other than their people and god."

 #Event Loc
 gisden.1.t:0 "Freed by the Rose"
 gisden.1.d:0 "As the Fourth Lilac War engulfed the whole of the Empire, the previous Count of Gisden and his wife perished after being attacked by roaming brigands. While some say the accident was no accident at all, the count’s line thankfully lived on in the form of his only son. Less than a year old at the time of his coronation, the boy was named Count Benar V of Gisden.\n\nIt was Lord Ostan, young Benar’s uncle, who took up the positions of both regent and commander of Gisden’s army. Managing to earn great merits during the Fourth Lilac War, he even wrestled an agreement from the rest of the Rose Party that Gisden be made independent from the Marquisate of Arannen at the war’s conclusion.\n\nWith peace established after years of conflict, Lord Ostan returned home to find that his nephew had grown to have a personality more fitting for a scholar rather than a ruler. In the year that has passed since, Count Benar V has come to rely wholly upon his uncle when it comes to the governance of the county, preferring instead to seclude himself in his study alongside his books."
 gisden.1.a:0 "Gisden cannot afford weakness."

 gisden.2.t:0 "Robber Barons"
 gisden.2.d:0 "While Gisden was part of the Marquisate of Arannen, it fell under the Marquis’ protection. Now, it must fend for itself.\n\nIn Gisden, many petty Arannese nobles have turned to banditry with the war’s end, plundering what little wealth remains. Lord Ostan, Count Benar’s uncle, has suggested that Gisden make a deal to forgive their crimes as long as they depart elsewhere. Without a battle, although the lives of many veterans will be spared, the burghers these brigands have stolen from are sure to be outraged.\n\nSome advisors, on the other hand, seem to see the situation as an opportunity. They insist that the brigands can be dealt with as long as Gisden’s levies are rallied, and that this would be the perfect opportunity for Count Benar to prove himself to his people."
 gisden.2.a:0 "Lord Ostan will bargain with them."
 gisden.2.b:0 "Count Benar V must prove himself!"

 gisden.3.t:0 "Ostan's Court"
 gisden.3.d:0 "With Lord Ostan’s success in negotiating with the robber barons, many have begun to give his words increasing importance. As one of the most experienced warriors and commanders in the whole of the Borders, Lord Ostan was quick to offer his opinion to any who would listen, frequently advocating for better relations with the militant Wexonards. After court meetings, he can be seen conversing with young and promising officers, as well as fellow veterans of the Lilac Wars. Many in court seem to welcome his vision of what Gisden’s future should look like.\n\nBut even as his uncle insists upon furthering military efforts and establishing new, powerful alliances, Count Benar V still seems to do little of worth. Rumors have even begun amongst the nobility that the Count has lost himself wholly in his musings and studies, preferring fantasies over the woes of reality..."
 gisden.3.a:0 "Lord Ostan is doing well, isn’t he?"
 gisden.3.b:0 "Count Benar V must endeavour to do better!"

 gisden.4.t:0 "Benar's Court"
 gisden.4.d:0 "Count Benar V himself led the charge against the robber barons, and by the end of the battle all of them had either been put down or forced to flee far beyond Gisden’s borders. The count appeared to have changed for the better, for after the battle his gaze appeared to gain a touch of sharpness, and his back had begun to straighten slightly.\n\nDespite being Count of Gisden, the count has long struggled to fulfill his duties. Whether due to reluctance or other reasons, more often than not he has relied upon his uncle, Lord Ostan, to govern in his stead.\n\nContinuing to do so would certainly be easier than struggling to finally be a proper count. But surely it couldn’t hurt to try?"
 gisden.4.a:0 "Lord Ostan is doing well, isn’t he?"
 gisden.4.b:0 "Count Benar V must endeavour to do better!"

 gisden.5.t:0 "Lothane's Summonings"
 gisden.5.d:0 "Word of the summonings spread across the court quickly. And, soon after, throughout the whole county. Lothane síl Wex, Emperor of Anbennar and Grand Duke of the Borders, had seen fit to summon Lord Ostan to Wexkeep for what he called ‘important discussions’.\n\nMany had noticed how Lord Ostan had slowly begun to take over the responsibilities that came with ruling over the county, with Count Benar V doing little to nothing to diminish his uncle’s growing importance. Now, with Lothane síl Wex himself taking notice, many see it as a sign that Lord Ostan will soon soar to higher heights..."
 gisden.5.a:0 "When Lord Ostan returned home, he did not do so alone."

 gisden.6.t:0 "Tensions in Court"
 gisden.6.d:0 "It is clear to all in Gisden’s court that Lord Ostan and Count Benar V have grown tense around each other. Count Benar V has taken to arguing with his uncle on what Gisden’s plans for the future should be, and swiftly the formerly good relations between the pair seem to have grown less than amicable.\n\nIt was not long, however, before a single letter sent the court spiraling into chaos. Lothane síl Wex, Emperor of Anbennar and Grand Duke of the Borders, had seen fit to invite a representative from Gisden to be sent to Wexkeep for what he called ‘important discussions’.\n\nLord Ostan insisted on attending personally, but Count Benar quickly objected. As they argued, voices raised, the courtiers quickly made themselves scarce. At the end of that hours long argument, a response was quickly sent to Lothane síl Wex.\n\nThe next day, horsemen departed from Gisden’s gates, escorting a lone carriage down the road to Wexkeep."
 gisden.6.a:0 "Lord Ostan departed for the meeting. When he returned, he was not alone."
 gisden.6.b:0 "Count Benar V rode out. The meeting at Wexkeep proved enlightening."

 gisden.7.t:0 "Lothane's Invitation"
 gisden.7.d:0 "Count Benar grows more confident by the day. As his uncle begins to relinquish his hold over the court with grace, the young count finds himself enjoying his duties for the very first time. Perhaps one day these feelings will diminish and only boredom will remain, but for now Gisden rests easy at knowing that its count has finally matured.\n\nIt is not long before Lothane síl Wex, Emperor of Anbennar and Grand Duke of the Borders, sends an invitation to Gisden. He requests Count Benar’s presence at Wexkeep for important discussions. In the end, as Count Benar departs with an escort, many begin to see his growing assertiveness as the dawn of a new age for Gisden."
 gisden.7.a:0 "Count Benar V's meeting at Wexkeep proved enlightening."

 gisden.8.t:0 "Ostan, Count of Gisden"
 gisden.8.d:0 "Upon his return to the County of Gisden, Lord Ostan was accompanied by a small army of mercenaries and a Wexonard commander by the name of Bellac of Ironhill. As he arrived back at court, he was quick to gather his close supporters and speak of his wishes to see Gisden overcome the troubling times ahead.\n\nBoldly and without fear, he announced that he would be deposing his nephew and assuming the position of Count. None in his circle spoke against him, and although some battles occurred as Ostan’s enemies swiftly rose against him, in the end the Court fell under his control, and the rest of Gisden soon after."
 gisden.8.a:0 "Long live Count Ostan!"

 gisden.9.t:0 "Benar, Count of Gisden"
 gisden.9.d:0 "After returning from his meeting with the Emperor of Anbennar, Count Benar was filled with an energy that surprised all who knew him. The Count of Gisden soon assembled his court and boldly announced his plans to reform Gisden, intent on guiding it onto a better future. His voice, tinged with emotion as he spoke of promises and vows, inspired many who were present.\n\nBut although Count Benar promised to do right by his people, many considered his dreams foolish and unattainable. But of those many, few dared to speak up against the Count’s ambitions. Time would tell whether the promises proved to be empty or whether Gisden would truly ascend.\n\nCount Benar’s uncle, Lord Ostan, departed months after his nephew’s speech. Citing that his duties in Gisden were settled, he rode with a few close friends out of Gisden’s gates with little ruckus. Word spread that he had found himself in Escann, intent on making his own fortune."
 gisden.9.a:0 "Long live Count Benar V!"

 gisden.10.t:0 "Clash of the Gods"
 gisden.10.d:0 "After being secluded to a manor by his uncle, the former Count Benar V found himself once again drawn towards books. His life was peaceful, quiet, and without worry, and day by day, he immersed himself in his reading. Eventually, he took to writing his own books in order to entertain himself.\n\nConsidered to be Count Benar’s masterpiece, ‘Clash of the Gods’ was inspired by the news hailing from Escann, where Corin made her stand against Dookanson. The book detailed Agrados’ and Castellos’ conflict during the Godswar, spoke of Agrados’ possible redemption, and was the source of much discussion amongst priests and scholars as a result.\n\nWith copies of his books selling swiftly, Count Benar grew into a rich man. It was not long before a generous donation found itself in Gisden’s coffers, by someone who wished to remain unknown."
 gisden.10.a:0 "Wonderful!"

 gisden.11.t:0 "News from the East"
 gisden.11.d:0 "As the chaos in Escann grew, word of Lord Ostan rarely came back to Gisden. Only a few letters detailing his exploits as part of many different expeditions and adventurer companies were lucky enough to head back west. With goblins, orcs, and even adventurers plunging the remnants of Escann’s chivalric realms into turmoil, the situation remained troublesome and unclear for decades.\n\nToday, a man arrived at Gisden. Bearing a striking resemblance to Lord Ostan, he claimed to be the man’s son and has presented Lord Ostan’s signet ring and a signed letter as proof. Wishing to aid the county, as his father once had, he has offered his fealty to Gisden."
 gisden.11.a:0 "He is more than welcome!"

 gisden.12.t:0 "A Wexonard Marriage"
 gisden.12.d:0 "During the Lilac Wars, the Grand Duchy of Wex demanded rights to Embergarden and Autumnfield after defeating Arannen and Asheniande in a battle spoken in song. At the time, Wex’s actions were met with little opposition from the war-weary Moon Party.\n\nNow, as the County of Gisden and the Grand Duchy of Wex’s ties grow deeper, we have been granted these two territories as part of an exorbitant dowry. Perhaps it is our growing strength that has led the Grand Duchy of Wex to make such a move, or perhaps it is truly a gift given in good faith. Regardless, it would be foolish to refuse their generosity.\n\nOnly the gods know whether our feelings towards Wex will change with time or whether we shall always stand by their side. But for now, and in the days to come, the County of Gisden and the Grand Duchy of Wex are bound not only by friendship but also by blood."
 gisden.12.a:0 "Cheers!"

 gisden.13.t:0 "The Partition of Gisden"
 gisden.13.d:0 "Horror is on the face of every man gathered around the room. The letter is read once, twice, and then a final time by all present. The words sent by our spies reveal a plot that may lead to Gisden’s doom: Arannen and Asheniande intend to partition Gisden and right the wrongs done to them during the Fourth Lilac War.\n\nDiscussions occur in that room. Men speak of countless plans, talking in hushed tones as though afraid their enemies could hear them. They suggest begging for intervention from the rest of the Empire; they consider peacefully submitting to the Arannese boot once more; and they wonder whether victory is even possible in the first place. In the end, all options but one are discarded. Gisden shall never surrender; war is coming.\n\nAlthough our enemies’ intentions couldn’t be clearer, it seems there is still some time before they choose to act in full. Gisden must plan, prepare, and be ready to call upon its allies. We have endured Arannen’s wrath before; we will do so again."
 gisden.13.a:0 "We must strike first!"

 gisden.14.t:0 "A Just War"
 gisden.14.d:0 "Arannen and Asheniande had intended to partition the lands of Gisden between their two realms. Now, we have swept aside their ambitions and enforced our will upon them.\n\nIt is not long before we are summoned to the Imperial Parliament to answer for our acts. A Marquis of the Empire falling is not a matter so easily ignored. In response to the Imperial Prince’s worries, we bring forth proof of our claims. Evidence carefully collected during the war, witnesses bribed to speak on our behalf, and captives coerced to reveal the truth.\n\nAfter examining all that we have brought forward, the Empire ultimately agrees that our war against Arannen was just. Although the Marquis’ remaining relatives, present to stand bear against us, screamed and shouted in frustration at the results, there was little they could do about the Imperial Parliament’s decision.\n\nDespite Arannen having been brought low, the war is not over; Tellum, Toarnen, and Celliande. All three of them supported Arannen in different ways during our conflict with them, whether through selling the Marquisate weapons and supplies or other, nefarious means. Gisden shall remember. They will pay for what they have done."
 gisden.14.a:0 "For Gisden!"

 gisden.15.t:0 "The Matter of Téinmas"
 gisden.15.d:0 "The province of Téinmas was once part of the Duchy of Asheniande, a title we now lay claim to. After the Fourth Lilac War, it fell under the control of the Elfrealm of Ibevar, but its people remained Arannese rather than elves.\n\nConsidering our friendship with the elves of Ibevar, they would surely be glad to part ways with a small parcel of land in order to quell any tensions that may linger between our peoples. Téinmas, after all, is Arannese and should belong to an Arannese realm. But is Téinmas truly worth this much trouble?"
 gisden.15.a:0 "Téinmas is rightfully ours!"
 gisden.15.b:0 "Our friendship with Ibevar is more important to us."

 gisden.16.t:0 "Gisdenese Demands"
 gisden.16.d:0 "A letter arrives. It bears the seal of the Counts of Gisden and of the Dukes of Asheniande. It is opened, slowly read, and then carefully considered.\n\nGisden wishes for Téinmas to be returned to them. Its people are Arannese, or so they argue, and they should be part of an Arannese realm. But elven blood was spilled in the Lilac Wars. The sons, fathers, and brothers of the people of Ibevar died, and our recompense was to be Téinmas. A land Ibevar laid claim to yet never truly owned, part of the Forlorn Vale.\n\nGisden is our ally. Would such an exchange be worth the pain and discontent our people would surely feel?"
 gisden.16.a:0 "We paid the price for Téinmas, it is ours."
 gisden.16.b:0 "Gisden’s claim is greater."

 gisden.17.t:0 "Damescrowner Interest"
 gisden.17.d:0 "The salt trade is a crucial industry for the Arannese people. For centuries if not millenia, we would work the mines in the Borders, exporting salt to all corners of Cannor.\n\nDuring the Lilac Wars, the tearing of the Empire in two led to a severe lapse in the Salt Trade. In almost an instant, as brother turned upon brother, the number of customers requesting Arannese salt was significantly diminished, and our influence plummeted. With the Rose Party preferring to rely upon Beepeck and Vertesk for salt due to Arannen standing with the Moon Party, the Arannese suffered and mine after mine was closed down. Even after the war’s end, Beepeck and Vertesk continue to push their own salt over ours.\n\nWith our unification of Arannese lands and our renewed production of salt, an offer has arrived from the Electorate of Damescrown. Wishing to diminish the might of their rivals in Beepeck and Vertesk, Damescrown has offered to fund our ambitions as long as we aggressively expand into their rival’s markets and steal their share of the salt trade. With their backing, weakening the two republics is sure to benefit us heavily. The proposal seems far too beneficial for us to even think of declining."
 gisden.17.a:0 "A deal is struck!"

 gisden.18.t:0 "Ruins of Quintenbury"
 gisden.18.d:0 "Today, in Quintenbury, men tasked with digging the foundations of the Count’s Archives unearthed what appeared to be another Milcorissian ruin complex. The discovery was considered to be of negligible worth, as most ruins contain nothing but rocks and dirt, long pillaged over the past centuries.\n\nThis time, things were different. An adventuring party sent to examine the ruins uncovered books, artworks, and more, all intact. Rather than ruins, it almost seems as though a whole Milcorissian structure had been driven deep into the earth from one day to the next.\n\nAs the Milcorissian writings that we found were translated, the discoveries were shocking: whole books filled with Milcorissian lineages, with many nobles and even the Count’s own family being able to find known ancestors within; parchments covered front and back with Milcorissia’s history, detailing events eerily similar to Arannese children’s tales, previously thought to be fanciful fabrications; a map detailing the location of ruins throughout the whole of the borders, the largest of which appeared to be found in the place where the Tower of Varlosen now stands… and much, much more.\n\nThroughout the county, word spreads of a once-mighty kingdom, one that the ancestors of the people of Gisden had proudly been part of. One whose history was deliberately erased in thorough detail. One whose legacy we have finally uncovered."
 gisden.18.a:0 "What else has been hidden from us?"

 gisden.19.t:0 "The Tower of Varlosen"
 gisden.19.d:0 "The Magisterium has kept watch over the Arannese for long. Once, the people of the Borders had wondered why they had chosen Varlosen as the location of their tower, but now know their reasons were less than kind. They sought to hide our birthright from us, for beneath the Tower of Varlosen’s foundations lies the largest Milcorissian ruins complex that Gisden found records of. It is our duty to investigate these ruins and to uncover the truth of our people, no matter the cost.\n\nBut when the Count finally arrived at the Tower of Varlosen at the head of an army, prepared to battle for his people’s past, he was met with silence. Magisters did not run out to question their approach, nor did fireballs rain down from the sky. Instead, a group of hooded, robe-clad men walked out of the tower’s gates, their faces featureless bearing ruby masks.\n\nThey introduce themselves as members of an organization called the Lodge of the Nameless. Over the years, they have wholly infiltrated the Tower of Varlosen and made it their own, awaiting the day when they would no longer need to fear discovery by the Magisterium. They claim to be remnants of the Milcorissia of old, and, as long as Gisden is willing to protect them from the Magisterium’s wrath, they would be happy to share all of their knowledge.\n\nThough their words are difficult to believe, the Count chooses to accept them. Accompanied by an escort, he marches into the tower’s interior to see that its walls are covered in blood. Magisters lay dead, their corpses and limbs scattered. Our count gazes upon them for but a moment. Then, he continues on his way, heading deeper into the tower’s depths."
 gisden.19.a:0 "And, at Varlosen, he found that Milcorissia endures."

 gisden.20.t:0 "A Kingly Coronation"
 gisden.20.d:0 "If we are to revive Milcorissia, it is only proper for us to adhere to its traditions. Thankfully, the records beneath the Tower of Varlosen detail much of how the Milcorissians lived and thought. Already many of the nobility have taken to speaking in Milcorissian to each other, alongside other traditions that we’ve rekindled.\n\nThe Necropolis is a monument to Nerat and the dead built by our ancestors. Even now, it is seen as an important religious site by the people of Cannor. Every king of Milcorissia, at least those we have records of, were crowned there. It was eventually decided that, if we are to claim Milcorissia’s legacy, we must follow in their steps.\n\nAt the depths of the Necropolis, surrounded only by dim candlelight and the dead, our ruler speaks an oath in a tongue ancient even to the Milcorissians. Painstakingly memorized and recited word by word, the oath is made, and our ruler swears himself to Nerat wholly and utterly. A bronze crown, engraved with glyphs and sigils that we were unable to decipher, is lifted with both hands and then placed upon his head. \n\nIn an instant, the Necropolis is plunged into darkness, all light in its depths snuffed out. Silence, eerie and unpleasant, consumes the count so utterly that he can hear his own heart beating.\n\nThe Count only departed the darkness after seven nights had passed."
 gisden.20.a:0 "Blessed be Nerat, Blessed be his Chosen."

 gisden.21.t:0 "Knowledge of the Ancients"
 gisden.21.d:0 "The walls of the Arca Aldresia are battered by cannons for days on end. When the fortress finally cracks, a tide of our soldiers barges inside, slaughtering the few remaining Aldresians who did not take to the field or flee from the siege. In the end, the knowledge they had stolen and hoarded in their vault is recovered. The diaries of Morgurax fall into our Count’s hands.\n\nThe Count finds himself unable to sleep, twisting and turning in his bed. He glances at the diaries upon his desk, still unread, feeling his heart beating without end. Something calls to him, urging him to chase after it. So he does. Accompanied by an escort, he rides and rides for what seems like hours. And, as he comes before the familiar sight that is the Tower of Varlosen, he heads down into its depths.\n\nHe does not know for how long he wanders. The ruins are gigantic, and not all of its halls have been mapped, not even by the Lodge of the Nameless. One by one, he notices his guards vanishing. But he persists, heading deeper into the darkness until –\n\n“Morgurax’s diaries?” A question reaches his ears. The voice was almost a cackle, dry, and grating to listen to. “He never let me read them. Come here, child. Hand them to me.”\n\nThe Count shivers. He feels death brushing against him. The diaries vanish from his grasp.\n\n“Accompany me for a while,” the voice mutters, even as the sound of pages turning echo through the darkness. “Would you, child?”"
 gisden.21.a:0 "The Count never spoke of what happened in Varlosen's depths."
