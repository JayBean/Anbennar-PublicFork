 flavor_gawed.1.d:0 "A cry of "Sire! Sire!" rings out throughout the din of the war room. The clamor of generals and messengers hushes into a terse silence. You wearily trace the disturbance to its source - a sweating, frantic looking youth, disheveled in appearance and sweating with exhaustion. You regard him testily, giving him a brief moment to find his breath.\n\nThe messenger inclines his head and takes a knee. "They are routed! The Gawedi Eagle flies high above the Forest!"\n\nThe tent erupts into a cacophony of cheers, congratulating themselves on the turn of events. You rise hastily, fastening your scabbard to your hip, previous fatigue banished. The youngster, just a boy, really, flinches as your hand falls to his shoulder. "Valiant cousin!" you exclaim, "See yourself dismissed." You bark an order at a retainer, instructing him to accommodate the boy in the reserve camp. You leave the tent, eager to join your men. The sacred elven ground would be put to the torch. They would have their retribution upon that cursed Ioriel. The elves wanted their scourge, well, they would have it. For the Gawedi people refused to be appeasers any more."

The Redglades were a symbol of gratitude from all of Cannor to the elven people... until now.\n\nThe Gawedi scourge have done the unspeakable and razed the forest to the ground. Scarcely few elves survive to tell the tale, but all is clear: the wanton slaughter and desecration of sacred elven ground confirms the basis that has clouded the minds of the south for too long - that the Gawedi are nothing more than barbarians and should be treated as such."

Smelling opportunity Derek created an advisory board, the Board of Magnates; composed of the most prominent merchant families of the realm they would advise the king on financial matters.

Instead, the city’s gates were open, the forts abandoned, and a great rush of tracks heading north toward Gaweton the only sign of the enemy’s flight.

If the knights of the Orda Aldresia failed in their duty, all would be lost. \n\nIn one last desperate push, they rallied their brothers and made a single thundering push to the throne room. Cutting through the Gawedi in a furious whirlwind of steel and shot, the knights rumbled to the broken doors of the throne room and there saw the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Emperor.Monarch.GetHerHis] small dwindling bodyguard.\n\nThe Aldresians fought valiantly.

When the sons of the Alen came, they took their toll, and many children of Dameria and Esmaria fell among the burned orchards and muddy banks of the north.\n\n But still the Imperial army marched. Weakened, battered, and bruised, they repulsed the foe and pushed forward, for theirs was a mission of higher import. This was a lesson about the sanctity of the Empire - a lesson the lords in Gaweton had forgotten. The Anbennarians marched, and carved their bloody swathe across the countryside as they approached the Gawedi capital.\n\nWhen they arrived, the princes and dukes did not want to wait for a siege - the anger that boiled in the blood of the dovesworn was great, so much imperial life had been lost. Vengeance were they, and they were here in the heights over Gawed. No, it was no longer the Eagle who loomed. Imperial wizards and cannons bombarded the walls of the Gawedi capital, and Empire forces rushed through the many breaches into the city center.\n\nAs the defenders were routed and thrown to flight, the imperial vanguard approached the Gawedi palace.
