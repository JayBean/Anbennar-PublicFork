  G54_1_2_play_to_their_weaknesses_title: "Play to Their Weaknesses"
  G54_1_2_play_to_their_weaknesses_desc: "A relationship forged by trade can be very strong indeed. They thrive on the honouring of deals, a mutual respect between partners, and of course mutual profit and benefit. We can see this in the relationship between Empkeios and Keyolíon, who have been partners for generations. However, when the pillars that uphold relationships built on trade fall apart, a lasting partnership can quickly turn to a scornful rivalry. By taking a hammer to these pillars, we may be able to engineer a war between two of our northern neighbours. And after that? Well, how could either side refuse us if we made an offer of generous aid… for a price."
  G54_1_3_and_their_strengths_title: "And Their Strengths"
  G54_1_3_and_their_strengths_desc: "Our plan went perfectly. The losing party has become the winning one, and we have used our influence over them to enforce our will for good. Now that our conquest of northern Devand is entering its final stages, however, there are more pressing matters, namely what to do with our new vassal. The answer seems obvious – exploit their strengths. By supporting the commercial nature of Keyolíon and Empkeios, we can create a rich and prosperous vassal, whose wealth can flow from the ports of the north to the harbour of our own fine city!"
  G54_1_4_reorganize_and_rebuild_title: "Reorganize and Rebuild"
  G54_1_4_reorganize_and_rebuild_desc: "Despite expanding our dominion to include northern Devand, and attempting to improve the economic and political situation up there, things are still not to the level of prosperity we would like – it seems we may need to invest a little more into the three northern Nékheis in order to get them on their feet."
  G54_1_5_exploring_new_depths_title: "Exploring New Depths"
  G54_1_5_exploring_new_depths_desc: "The Arcane is a much loved subject for the philosopher. In the millenia and a half since the ruin, they have been trying their best to pick the fundamentals of it apart, make sense of it, contextualise it – but unfortunately thinking a lot about why magic exists doesn’t translate into actually learning how to cast it. By investing heavily into arcane studies, we will be able to fill this gaping hole in our knowledge, and take advantage of the more mystical aspects of the world we inhabit."
  G54_1_6_expand_our_influence_title: "Expand our Influence"
  G54_1_6_expand_our_influence_desc: "Besolakí was founded with a dream in mind – the creation of a true democracy, where every man had his say and liberty of thought reigned. But as time went on, and the guiding philosophy of the city fractured and broke apart, the philosophical factions of the city each, in their hearts, desired their own sort of freedom – the freedom to implement their way of thinking to the very fullest, to have their own Besolakí. With all of Devand under our control, the opportunity to fulfil this desire has finally arrived."

  G54_2_1_the_dim_the_darkest_title: "The Dim and Darkest"
  G54_2_1_the_dim_the_darkest_desc: "Other cities prefer to wage their wars in the light, spilling blood and wasting treasure on costly, horrific, “glorious” battles. To the Skighúbhen, a philosophical school that emphasises the benefits of the cloak-and-dagger over spear-and-shield, that reeks of Taychendi-style vainglory. Why fight and die in the day, when you can hide and strike in the night? Funding the Skighúbhen’s activities, and allowing them to found an academy of their own so they can train themselves in the arts of espionage, will surely give us an edge up on our enemies."
  G54_2_2_making_the_loyalists_rebel_title: "Making the Loyalists Rebel"
  G54_2_2_making_the_loyalists_rebel_desc: "The ties of father and son are difficult to break, and so we have found with Eneion, our northern neighbour. They are by far the closest Nékheis to their overlord, considering themselves a bastion of loyalty on the mainland – but any relationship has its cracks. One particular crack may be able to be exploited – the irrational fear of and desire for separation. There seems to be an instinctual part of a Kheion’s urban psyche that renders them always afraid of their child city running off for good – and a part of a Nékheis’ psyche that whispers how much easier it would be if they just cut themselves off. This may be our way in…"
  G54_2_3_the_trilidir_library_title: "The Trilidír Library"
  G54_2_3_the_trilidir_library_desc: "The Trilidír Library is a testament to Eneion’s power – built a ways inland at a time when that was a difficult thing indeed, and defended from Basobhar attacks for many centuries, that symbolic value has always mattered more to Eneion than the actual riches stored within its walls. They may be our valued subject, but they are also a bunch of stubborn ignoramuses – if they will not use the library to its full advantages, maybe someone that can should take charge of it! The Caríbhen has graciously volunteered for the purpose, and we are certain they will make great stewards of the Library."
  G54_2_4_upgrading_our_navy_title: "Upgrading our Navy"
  G54_2_4_upgrading_our_navy_desc: "Anisíkheion have always thought of themselves as some sort of “Kheion of the sea”, even sometimes daring to say that they should be considered the “eighth Kheion”, since they’re technically not on the mainland. In short, they’re a bunch of upjumped sailors – but they are very good sailors indeed. If we play to their arrogance, promise them both protection under our rule and the islands they have always desired, we can easily convince them to declare “independence”!"
  G54_2_5_strengthing_our_bonds_title: "Strengthing our Bonds"
  G54_2_5_strengthing_our_bonds_desc: "Oh yes, we may have our differences with the other Nékheis – they may be a bunch of brutes, they may be uneducated, uncultured in some areas, uninterested in the specifics of philosophy… but they are still our brothers! And they are still, of course, equal to us in dignity, if not in education. By establishing a body in which all of the Nékheis can have a voice, we can strengthen our bonds with the rest of the mainland, and our people in general, taking us one step further to fulfilling Varamelas’ dream at last."

  G54_3_1_breaking_the_chains_title: "Breaking the Chains"
  G54_3_1_breaking_the_chains_desc: "Woe to the tyranny of the librarian! Lokemeion, our “parent Kheion”, have never had a high opinion of us, nor have they respected us. They force an unwelcome government, make us pay unwelcome taxes, infringe on our fundamental freedoms! Thankfully, our Riárchis has a plan. Revolution! Well, obviously, but a “smart” revolution! By overthrowing our existing oligarchy, our overlord will be forced to invade – and what other Kheion would care to interrupt Lokeimeion’s internal affairs? Or, more frankly, interrupt them making a terrible mistake. Let’s overturn the tables, smack our overlords in the face with them, and break our chains!"
  G54_3_2_radicalize_the_farms_title: "Radicalize the Farms"
  G54_3_2_radicalize_the_farms_desc: "It has always been a wonder how Apikhoxí managed to create such a quaint, rural society without even readings the dialogues of Thelriothos or Andrellionides – but no matter! Masters of the countryside they have become, and who are we to denigrate how they reached that status? In fact, a significant group of the republic, spearheaded by the Kheinbhen and Skighúbhen, have argued that we ought to exploit their love of rurality, giving them the resources they need to expand deeper into the mainland whilst we focus on developing our own cities. First we need to convince them to join our cause, however – but they’re just a bunch of farmers. A bit more dialogue may be all they need after all!"
  G54_3_3_a_better_option_title: "A Better Option"
  G54_3_3_a_better_option_desc: "Desperate, hopeful Amgremós, left stranded by the subjugation of their old parent city. They acquired their freedom by accident, and they have struggled greatly since to keep it, turning to making deals with pirates in order to survive. It is rare we actually get the chance to help a people down on our luck, instead of engineering a disaster we can save them from, so let’s take advantage of their misfortune and offer them a better option."
  G54_3_4_the_old_fashioned_way_title: "The Old Fashioned Way"
  G54_3_4_the_old_fashioned_way_desc: "To most of the philosophical schools, warfare is but a tool in the arsenal, that has its strengths, but more weaknesses – the Dhorbhen and Deyebhen, however, similarly and strongly disagree. No wonder the Dhorbhen have found common ground with their found family in the east – they call for us to support Deyeion’s independence and help them gain it the old fashioned way, through blood and bronze. Straightforwards enough – and besides, we can simply turn our support on its head and force them under our wing afterwards anyway, our military support turning to a shortsword at their army’s throat. Betrayal has never failed us before, after all – what could possibly go wrong?"
  G54_3_5_unite_the_league_title: "Unite the League"
  G54_3_5_unite_the_league_desc: "All Kheionai peoples east of Alecand are now under our control – excepting, of course, Ameion. They have always been apart from the rest of the mainlanders. First, in proximity, the furthest away from western Devand. Second, in tradition, being amiable to monarchy and democracy in equal measure. And finally in strength – the ascent of Laskaris the Conqueror has brought them vast fortunes in Taychend. If we are to bring them too into the fold, we must show that we can be as strong as they. Even then, we cannot expect much – the Ambhen have become accustomed to conquest, and they will undoubtedly expect to continue at it."
  G54_3_6_declaring_unity_title: "Declaring Unity"
  G54_3_6_declaring_unity_desc: "There was once an elf with a dream, that all could live in a free and equal democracy, governed according to the philosophical ideal. It has been a long time since that elf died, and though that dream has saw endless struggle and countless defeats, Varamelas can finally rest easy. The cities of Devand and the Andic Reach are now united under the aegis of Besolakí."

  G54_4_1_a_kheionai_renaissance_title: "A Kheionai Renaissance"
  G54_4_1_a_kheionai_renaissance_desc: "In the millennium and a half since the first Deathwind, Kheionai civilisation has been slowly progressing, and we stand as, to our knowledge, the most advanced civilisation in the world. However, our accomplishments are still a fraction of what the ancients seemed to have achieved – and if we are to create a perfect society, we will surely need their level of sophistication. By building up the institutions of research and philosophy in our own city, staying on top of the latest advancements of the day, and perhaps looking to our scholarly kin in Lokemeion and Eneion’s Trilidír Library, we may be able to kickstart a new Kheionai Renaissance, and rediscover the secrets of the past."
  G54_4_2_learning_from_our_elders_title: "Learning from our Elders"
  G54_4_2_learning_from_our_elders_desc: "Though we have severed ourselves from Alecand’s control, that does not mean we have nothing to learn from our brothers on the other side of the Cleaved Sea. They have kept their republics for many centuries now, and if we are to keep our own democracy then we must study how they have done so. Institutions of governance, political theory and philosophy, the culture of democracy – all of these things and more may be vital to the survival of our state… and to the fulfillment of Varamelas’ Dream."
  G54_4_4_getting_the_lay_of_the_land_title: "Getting the Lay of the Land"
  G54_4_4_getting_the_lay_of_the_land_desc: "The Mteibhar’s culture of militarism, social and political organisation, and above all their mastery of earth-magic, which gives them command over the land itself, have made them formidable enemies – and therefore worthy of study. While our new friends in Apikhoxí have some experience inland, with their rural settlements reaching a ways into the river valley near their city, if we are to control the upper reaches of Devand we must get the lay of the land from those who have controlled it for so long."
  G54_4_5_warlord_training_title: "The Art of Glory"
  G54_4_5_warlord_training_desc: "War! The art of steel and bronze, of blood and destruction and devastation. No land has seen more of it than Taychend, and no people have mastered it more than the Taychendi. They might be brutish, backwards and uncivilised barbhen, but if we are to protect our own people, and perhaps expand the ideals of our republic even more, then we must learn from the warlords of the east. To that end, our ruler has decided to prepare a voyage along the Path of Wine, following in the footsteps of Laskaris the Conqueror and embarking on a journey to Taychend."
  G54_4_6_lessons_from_the_exemplers_title: "Lessons from the Exemplars"
  G54_4_6_lessons_from_the_exemplers_desc: "When the “Jaherian Exemplars” arrived in Aelantir from across the ocean, returning from an exile of a thousand years, they brought with them a strange religion and stranger beliefs. Beliefs in a single god, Surael, in fervent abolitionism, in cults and heralds. While we see no use in adopting those beliefs as some among the Taychendi have, we do have much to learn from their methods of spreading it – and imposing it – on others. By seeing where they went right and wrong, we may be able to spread the teachings of Kheionism to our own people, as they spread the light of Surael to others."

  G54_5_1_embrace_the_chaos_title: "Embrace the Chaos"
  G54_5_1_embrace_the_chaos_desc: "In the west, the Kheionai have never been a fan of true democracy. There are some examples of it, of course, but the elites of Alecand prefer to keep their politics to themselves – neat and tidy debate, control through “consensus”. But to the Kaydhano with stability! We want Democracy! Chaotic, messy Democracy! Shouting matches and fist-fights in the assembly chamber Democracy! Thankfully our fine people have taken that demand to heart – already we’re breaking down like fractions, as different philosophical schools form their own cliques and factions within the halls of government. Let’s encourage this and forge a true chaotic democracy!"
  G54_5_2_creating_fair_elections_title: "Creating Fair Elections"
  G54_5_2_creating_fair_elections_desc: "We have a free republic, and now a democracy – but do we have a free democracy? The factions within our city clamour for power, and that’s healthy enough, but that desire is left unchecked – and if the abilities of the offices they aspire to are left unchecked – power may well turn to tyranny. We must redesign our elections, abolish the right of re-election and introduce laws to make our elections freer and fairer. Only then, can Varamelas’ Dream be fulfilled."
  G54_5_3_encouraging_democracy_title: "Encouraging Democracy"
  G54_5_3_encouraging_democracy_desc: "We have made our elections fairer, and our democracy freer, but still there are cracks in our system. The hearts of the factions are corrupting once more, as they turn to dark words of conspiracies and political projects. If we are to fulfil Varamelas’ Dream, we must set this vital part of our democracy right! By encouraging democracy among our factions, and reminding them of the great society we might one day achieve, there is still hope that we can turn factional fighting into a boon, not a hindrance, to democracy."
  G54_2_1_varamelas_dream_title: "Varamelas’ Dream"
  G54_2_1_varamelas_dream_desc: "The factions fight not to introduce tyranny, but to further the goals of democracy, within the bounds of our political system, while reasoned debates and shouting matches alike are fought over issues of policy, not of constitution. The plan is working, but yet more must be done! The factions must be more factional, the debates must be more reasoned, the shouting matches must be more violent! We must go both further and faster, until the chaotic wheels of the cart of democracy overrun the horses of self-interest and take us to the stable of liberty and prosperity!"
  G54_5_5_pan_aelantir_trade_title: "Pan-Aelantir Trade"
  G54_5_5_pan_aelantir_trade_desc: "The Cannorians are a superstitious and aristocratic people, a ways apart from us in ideals, though perhaps not in sophistication – though we must be wary of them, their power is undeniable, as are their riches. As they loot and plunder the rest of Aelantir, and in the process connect the continent more than it ever has been before, we must maintain good relations with them. If our diplomats are successful, we may be able to attach ourselves to their trade networks, gaining both information and a cut of the profits."
  G54_5_6_revolutionary_firearms_title: "Revolutionary Firearms"
  G54_5_6_revolutionary_firearms_desc: "The firearm – on the face of it, they seem to be nothing but more advanced weapons of war, no different in terms of identity or thematic conceptualisation than a bow and arrow. But if you look deeper, you start to see the true implications of their adoption. You see, firearms are perhaps the most democratic invention since Varamelas himself left his mother’s womb! For now, we can grant the most vital power, the power to shoot a musket-ball through your enemies head at over 300 yards or more, to every citizen of our great nation! Gone are the days of warrior castes and military dynasts, who cast themselves in the mould of Degakheion – in are the days of the revolutionary firearm! Now we just need to find somewhere to test them..."

  #Events

  besolaki_events.1.t: "The Philosopher’s Revolt"
  besolaki_events.1.d: "It is done. Our Riárchis has become a Kylakas, but not of the normal sort – a ruler of a true democracy, a government of the citizen, not the oligarch! The scholar, not the librarian! All across our nation, the people cry out in joy and celebration, as a thousand years of foreign rule comes to an end. Soon, the time will come when the dream of our founder Varamelas may be fulfilled. Soon, but not now, for a storm brews on the horizon – though it is a storm we have not only foreseen, but a storm we welcome.\n\nEven as the ink on our declaration of a new government dries, our former overlord Lokeimeion is writing a similar declaration – a declaration of war! Their soldiers and galleys gather, and will soon set sail against us, but they do so alone. Just as we have planned, none of the other great Kheions speak of intervention. Though they will undoubtedly come for us once we are outside the Lokebhen aegis, that is a war for a different day. Today, we fight for freedom, for democracy, and for Besolakí!"
  besolaki_events.1.a: "Woe to the tyranny of the librarian!"

  besolaki_events.2.t: "Victory, Absolute"
  besolaki_events.2.d: "“Victory! Victory! Victory!”\n\nSo goes the chant in the symposium, in the gymnasium, in the acropolis and the ports and the rural villages. So goes the chant of the mother, of the father, of the child and slave, of the soldier and farmer and trader and philosopher. For victory is at last at hand – we have won, absolutely and completely! Lokemeion does not only sail away with their tails between their legs, with their shields shattered and their galleys broken upon our shores – they do so for good.\n\nThat we must still defend our city from outside threats there is no doubt. The powers of Alecand eye us hungrily, while the other Nékheis, eager either to show loyalty to their masters or enhance their position in their own independence struggle, will likely be considering military action of their own. Not to mention the barbhen. But our concerns are now over that of an independent city-state, not a puppeteered province. For the first time since the demise of Varamelas, we are well and truly free!"
  besolaki_events.2.a: "Now the real work begins."

  besolaki_events.3.t: "The Dream Defeated"
  besolaki_events.3.d: "The streets of Besolakí are emptied, the makeshift barricades burned and blackened, the walls thrown down and destroyed. Public business is ended, for now, as the country retreats into itself. Soldiers bury their panoply in fear of punishment, scholars and philosophers burn their letters of correspondence, their proclamations and dialogues, treasonous once more. Traders count their remaining stock – that which was not taken by the Lokebhen.\n\nThe woman weeps, while the man hangs his head in shame. As the former Kylakas signs the instrument of surrender, and becomes a Riárchis once more, how could they not? Besolakí’s gamble has failed, the city’s army and navy has been shattered, and Lokemeion has stamped out Varamelas’ dream once and for all.\n\nOr at least that’s what they would like to think. Though the ambitions of our people have nearly been extinguished, a few embers remain. But they must remain that – embers. If the fire of revolution is to be stoked once more, we can only do so from a position of greater strength. Next time – if there is a next time – our overlord will not be as lenient."
  besolaki_events.3.a: "Despair!"

  besolaki_events.4.t: "Victory, Exhausted"
  besolaki_events.4.d: "“Victory! Victory! Victory!”\n\nSo goes the chant in the symposium, in the gymnasium, in the acropolis and the ports and the rural villages. So goes the chant of the mother, of the father, of the child and slave, of the soldier and farmer and trader and philosopher. So goes the chant of grieving spouse, the orphaned child, as they celebrate through their tears.\n\nThe war was difficult, long and tiring. There is not one among us who did not lose someone dear – but our woes are matched by the Lokebhen’s. And with their soldiers finally departing our shores, dejected and defeated, we prove the victor. For we have kept our independence, and they have lost a colony.\n\nThat we must still defend our city from outside threats there is no doubt. The powers of Alecand eye us hungrily, while the other Nékheis, eager either to show loyalty to their masters or enhance their position in their own independence struggle, will likely be considering military action of their own. Not to mention the barbhen. But our concerns are now over that of an independent city-state, not a puppeteered province. For the first time since the demise of Varamelas, we are well and truly free!"
  besolaki_events.4.a: "We mourn our dead, and celebrate our future."

  besolaki_events.5.t: "Coming to the Rescue"
  besolaki_events.5.d: "The schemers rub their hands in delight, the diplomats crack wry smiles, while the Kylakas listens with feigned concern, as the envoy of a Nékheis on the ropes begs for intervention. Isn’t it a beautiful thing, when a plan comes together? Our plots in the north have finally come to fruition, as the war between Keyolíon and Empkeios, the war we had a hand in starting, reaches its intended destination.\n\nIt had been going badly for a while now, and we had in truth already received multiple envoys already asking for aid. But the conditions – their offers – had not been satisfactory, and so we sent them away, fully aware they would come crawling back. And now they beg for aid, and in return they offer their freedom.\n\nThey don’t know what they’re trading in. For while they believe they are offering freedom, and gaining mere survival in return, they are in fact offering mere independence for total liberation! Democracy is coming to northern Devand, whether they like it or not!"
  besolaki_events.5.a: "Another victory for Besolakí!"

  besolaki_events.6.t: "Take These, and Learn"
  besolaki_events.6.d: "Every year, the Degabhen sent an emissary to Eneion. They were met on the docks by the Riárchis of the city and all the members of the city’s assembly and government, the usual banners of Eneion replaced with those of their overlord. Usually, it was a mere formality, but years of growing tension and animosity, driven by undercover Besobhen agents, had turned the affair into a vital pillar of Degakheion’s colonial policy – and one that stood on shaky ground. Now, the leading elves of Eneion gathered once more in the city harbour, as a Degabhen ship pulled into port. But there was one difference – the city did not fly the banner of Degakheion. They flew the banner of Besolakí.\n\nThe Degabhen emissary, flanked by armed guards, approached the Riárchis of Eneion with a grim expression on his face. “A declaration of war,” he said, nodding as he looked at the magenta banners flying around him, “but who,” he asked, looking around the crowd, “is making the declaration?”\n\nAn elf in a magenta-striped cloak stepped forwards, a satisfied smile on his lips. “Here I stand”, the Besobhen ambassador said, “and I do so with pleasure. I hope you do not take this too harshly, but is it not a Degabhen saying that it is the nature of the strong to take from the weak? Your rhetoric has failed you – you have lost the battle of words.”\n\nThe emissary grimaced. “It seems you do not know what battle is,” he said, as he gestured to a guard to give him his spear and shield. A moment later, he threw them down, the clang of steel on stone ringing out through the port. “Take these, and learn.”"
  besolaki_events.6.a: "Arrogant fools…"

  besolaki_events.7.t: "Eneion Declares... Subjugation?"
  besolaki_events.7.d: "Eneion just decided to become Besolakí's vassal to protect themselves from us"
  besolaki_events.7.a: "Option 1"
  besolaki_events.7.b: "Option 2"

  besolaki_events.8.t: "Focusing our Efforts"
  besolaki_events.8.d: "Colonising takes up so much of the state’s time and energy. We must dedicate officials to raising revenue for the effort, outfit militias, send resources and grain to newly founded colonies, spend blood and treasure fighting the barbhen and much more besides. Though inland expansion remains vital to our growing strength, we have always dreamed of passing it off to some other group – and now with Apikhoxí under our control, it seems that “other group” has presented itself.\n\nThey are rural folk by nature, well suited to inland colonisation. While giving them control of our colonial efforts will undoubtedly lead to a loss of of flexibility, their honest and hardworking nature means that they’ll spend well each ounce of gold we send them – ultimately, however, the decision is in the Kylakas’ hands."
  besolaki_events.8.a: "Give them control of colonisation."
  besolaki_events.8.b: "It is better to keep our efforts separate."

  besolaki_events.9.t: "Piracy or Philosophy?"
  besolaki_events.9.d: "“You wanted to hear our offer, here it is!” the pirate said, as he stood in the centre of the Amgrebhen assembly, the notables of the Nékheis listening intently. “You give our ships free ports, and our sailors free shelter, and we give you a cut of our profits, and our protection!” There was a murmur of agreement, but there were still doubts, questions of character. The pirate scoffed. “I see the dour looks, the suspicious eyes. You think we’re disreputable – fine! True! But we’re loyal to profit, to prosperity for our own, and if you give that to us we’ll be loyal to you!”\n\nThe pirate stepped away to welcome looks and sparse applause. The Besóbhen envoy took his place. He gave an exaggerated sigh as he looked around the room, before he began to speak. “Forlorn Amgremós! How could it have come to this?” Every word was considered, the envoy’s tone finely tuned. “I look around and see both desperation and desire – desperation for aid, desire for security and happiness! And so you look to the pirates whose ships prowl the coasts of Devand. They would give aid and security, yes. But happiness? Did they give happiness to the families of the sailors they murdered, to those who made the galleys they sent to the bottom of the wine-dark sea? No!”\n\nThe pirate made a cry of complaint, but the Besóbhen envoy spoke over him, loud and clear. “Know that it is only us who offer your people happiness! And yes, your people. The farmer who gives you grain, the servant who pours you wine, the merchant who trades and the soldier who fights. We give the gift of democracy!” Some among the Amgrebhen assembly looked concerned, even as others nodded along contently. Time for the final piece, a reminder – and a threat. “You turn your heads, and so is your nature. But would those outside this building do the same? Who would they choose?” The envoy smiled. “Do you want to find out?”"
  besolaki_events.9.a: "They did not – after a conclusive vote, Amgremós chose us."

  besolaki_events.10.t: "Our Chance"
  besolaki_events.10.d: "Besolakí is offering to help us gain independence, and will even provide support to our troops"
  besolaki_events.10.a: "Option 1"

  besolaki_events.11.t: "May Cooler Heads Prevail"
  besolaki_events.11.d: "It seems we have grown quite adept at thrashing the Alecandi! The Kheions sent more of their armies across the cleaved sea, and we sent them back bloodied and bruised – with the help of our Deyebhen allies, of course! And of course, it was mutual assistance, so we spent them military advisors and logistical aid and coins and weapons and armour and supplies of cloth and grain and wine… and, of course, we planted spies– I mean, “placed little helpers” within every level of their military apparatus.\n\nThe Deyebhen can undoubtedly see them scurrying around, spreading pro-Besolakí sentiment wherever they go. Surely, then, they would understand that the power of Besolakí is great and the power of Deyeion small? We have already outlined the programme for the annexation ceremony – sending the request for vassalization should be a mere formality. Let’s include a threat too, to seal the deal – “if you do not agree to these terms, we will be forced to bring democracy to your people under any means necessary. We hope cooler heads will prevail and you shall agree to our request posthaste…”"
  besolaki_events.11.a: "Another Nékhei under our aegis!"

  besolaki_events.12.t: "An Ultimatum"
  besolaki_events.12.d: "Besolakí is now demanding we become their subject, perposterous! We are our own people, why would we trade one overlord for another? While there was a suspicious amount of support in the government, we will refuse!"
  besolaki_events.12.a: "Option 1"

  besolaki_events.13.t: "They Have Not Prevailed"
  besolaki_events.13.d: "“They have not prevailed.”\n\nThat was Deyeion’s four-word reply to our offer of vassalization, sent to us alongside 500 severed heads, belonging, we assume, to any pro-Besolakí politicians – and spies – the Deyebhen government could get their hands on. It seems the Deyebhen have inherited Degakheion’s famous dry wit, alongside their stubborn arrogance and predisposition for heroic last stands.\n\nWell we’ll indulge them in that predisposition. It seems we’ll have to send Deyeion’s soldiers back to their city lying dead on their shields! Given the amount of spies and influence over their military, that should be easier done than said. Let’s give them a steel-tipped lecture on why they should have bowed down to us when they had the chance!"
  besolaki_events.13.a: "To arms, soldiers of Besolakí!"
  besolaki_events.13.b: "Let them stew in their mistake, we have more important things to attend to."

  besolaki_events.14.t: "Where are our Subjects?"
  besolaki_events.14.da: "While we weren't looking Empkeios and Keyolíon appear to have fought each other and then became Besolakí's subject somehow"
  besolaki_events.14.a: "This Cannot Stand"
  besolaki_events.14.b: "It was their Choice"

  besolaki_events.15.t: "Intervention"
  besolaki_events.15.d: "Conflicts and skirmishes between the Nékheis are commonplace, and with the costs of sending assistance to Devand being rather high, the Great Kheions of Alecand are often content to let them fight it out. Traders and city officials watched the war between Empkeios and Keyolíon with concern, of course, but they could never quite compel their cities’ assemblies to action. After all, it would all end in some status quo peace or other, and business with their Nékheis would go back to usual.\n\nBut now, those traders and city officials awake to an entirely different situation. For they awake to find that they no longer control any Nékheis to do business with. And, to make matters even worse, Besolakí, the city of philosophers, controls both cities in their stead! With northern Devand completely reshaped, the pro-intervention factions of Oktikheion and Arpedifér have finally won the day, and the two cities now prepare their armies and navies for the voyage over the Cleaved Sea. It seems war has arrived on Devand’s shores once more."

  besolaki_events.50.d: "Welcome news from [FROM.GetName], as we have received word that the friends and allies we have been supporting there have been successful in overthrowing their tyrannical rulers. With their people finally free, the choice on what we ourselves should now do presents itself. While we can leave them independent, free to chart their own course, we can also use our influence to compel them to sign a mutual alliance. Of course, should we judge their lands useful to the fulfilment and protection of Varamelas Dream, we can also vassalise them. At the end of the day, the choice if yours to make."
  besolaki_events.50.a: "Leave them to their freedom – our job is done!"
  besolaki_events.50.b: "How could we refuse a partnership with our brothers in arms?"

Power is contested by a group of powerful factions, each of which are born from a specific philosophical school. Analogous to loose political parties, the clash between them upholds Besolakí’s democracy, as any one faction getting too powerful would hurt the others. It also encourages innovation and good governance, with intense, passionate debates and arguments between them driving the creation of new policies and the further development of philosophy. The frequent change of governing party therefore empowers the state further, while consolidation of power leads to stagnation."
