However, with recent technological advancements our engineers believe we can restore them to their former glory and perhaps raise them to even greater heights. There will be costs to such a project, but the benefits and prestige of undertaking such a restoration would be great, and potentially give us significant clout among the folk of Fahvanosy."

These cities have been in ruins for ages, consumed by the jungle and worn down by time, and none but bandits and smugglers make use of them. They are a burden to our land, haunted reminders of times best forgotten, blocking space for any useful things that could be built there. We must tear down their remnants and clear the land for something useful. This could cause dissent among our halfling population, but the engineers believe the task logistically simple."

He took particular notice of how the spread of the new faith had coincided with the rapid advancement of Baashidi society and power during the Age of Glory.

 fahvanosy.10.d:0 "The Summer Isles have been home to we halflings since time immemorial and following the destruction of the Vyzemby city states on the mainland, Fahvanosy became the only known place the halflings could call home. This has completely changed since a small merchant ship from Beepeck arrived on the shores of the Summer Isles, carrying our long lost brothers from Cannor. Suddenly we were not alone, which naturally sparked a wave of curiosity in our population wanting to learn more about our brothers. A link between our homelands was established and many other meetings soon followed, our people visiting the city of Beepeck or Beepecker merchants landing to trade Cannorian goods for spices and cloves.\n\nThe free movement of ideas spurred by this exchange introduced a new goddess of charity to us, Begga Goodfingers, venerated by the Regent Court Pantheon of our Cannorian brothers. Her worship started spreading in the Isles, slowly at first among merchants and adventurers visiting Cannor, but soon it spread among  the general populace.\n\nPriests of our Great Family have noticed this religious shift but there was no unified response, each shrine having a different attitude towards the new goddess. For these reasons the Summer Council has assembled in Lelanàn, with all shrines sending delegates and even a priest of Begga from Cannor being present. The goal was to decide the matters of the new goddess once and for all. Theological debates between different shrines are not uncommon but it has been centuries since a religious meeting of this size occurred. After months-long theological debates questioning the Cannorian priest, debating theological differences and similarities between Regent Court and Nakavy Avo and many minor debates between delegates from individual shrines, the Council came to a conclusion: Begga Goodfingers shall be officially accepted into the Great Family.\n\nThe canonisation of Begga has increased her popularity even more, with Cannorian priests already arriving in Loranakodro to help build a shrine for her."
