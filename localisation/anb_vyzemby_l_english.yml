However, with recent technological advancements our engineers believe we can restore them to their former glory and perhaps raise them to even greater heights.

These cities have been in ruins for ages, consumed by the jungle and worn down by time, and none but bandits and smugglers make use of them. They are a burden to our land, haunted reminders of times best forgotten, blocking space for any useful things that could be built there. We must tear down their remnants and clear the land for something useful. This could cause dissent among our halfling population, but the engineers believe the task logistically simple."

These tiered coastal fortresses were the Ananoma, the city states that formed the core of Vyzemby civilization. When the mainland halflings were expelled from their ancestral homes, the once proud Ananoma fell to ruin, abandoned by their human conquerors as unsuitable for habitation by tallfolk. There they have sat, crumbling and abandoned, for hundreds of years, their disintegrating edifices sad testament to this once-great civilization. Now that we have reclaimed the coast, however, we have a chance to undo the damage that time and conflict have inflicted on the beehive cities, and rebuild the Ananoma to the heights of their greatness."

This has completely changed since a small merchant ship from Beepeck arrived on the shores of the Summer Isles, carrying our long lost brothers from Cannor. Suddenly we were not alone, which naturally sparked a wave of curiosity in our population wanting to learn more about our brothers. A link between our homelands was established and many other meetings soon followed, our people visiting the city of Beepeck or Beepecker merchants landing to trade Cannorian goods for spices and cloves.\n\nThe free movement of ideas spurred by this exchange introduced a new goddess of charity to us, Begga Goodfingers, venerated by the Regent Court Pantheon of our Cannorian brothers. Her worship started spreading in the Isles, slowly at first among merchants and adventurers visiting Cannor, but soon it spread among the general populace.\n\nPriests of our Great Family have noticed this religious shift but there was no unified response, each shrine having a different attitude towards the new goddess. For these reasons the Summer Council has assembled in Lelanàn, with all shrines sending delegates and even a priest of Begga from Cannor being present. The goal was to decide the matters of the new goddess once and for all. Theological debates between different shrines are not uncommon but it has been centuries since a religious meeting of this size occurred. After months-long theological debates questioning the Cannorian priest, debating theological differences and similarities between Regent Court and Nakavy Avo and many minor debates between delegates from individual shrines, the Council came to a conclusion: Begga Goodfingers shall be officially accepted into the Great Family.\n\nThe canonisation of Begga has increased her popularity even more, with Cannorian priests already arriving in Loranakodro to help build a shrine for her."

 fahvanosy.11.t:0 "The Long Lost Kin"
 fahvanosy.11.d:0 "Ever since we first landed on the shores of Fangaula, soldiers have been reporting strange sights, particularly when trying to explore the coast further. Food goes missing on expeditions, the soldiers always have a feeling somebody is watching them and some even claim to see shadows resembling small people.\n\nToday one of our reconnaissance units reported a shocking discovery. After months of careful watching, the unknown beings have decided to show themselves. Surprisingly enough, they are one of our kin. It turns out that not every halfling managed to escape the human invasion of our cities. Some had to escape and hide, forced to flee from outsiders.\n\nOur cousins were as surprised to find out about our existence as we were about theirs. After the discovery was made, they invited us to a feast to celebrate this special day in one of their settlements, fully hidden from the outside world by many layers of illusion. \n\nIt turns out there are many settlements like this, and though some prefer to stay hidden, many are willing to join our reclamation effort."

 estate_mages_organization_proffesional_mihipha_desc:0 "For as long as can be remembered, the Vyzemby have been wandering and singing songs; passing down tales of heroes and tragedies of the ages past; helping the young gleam wisdom and truths from these ancient tales. For an equally long time, magic and the mysteries of our mages have enthralled the curious and astounded the cynical. However, never before has such wisdom and knowledge been gathered unto one place.\n\nUnder our enlightened and peaceful rule, bards, mages and scholars from across the Summer Isles flock to our college in Lorankodro, at last formalizing our great history of story-telling and knowledge sharing, and making it open and available to all."
 
 
 #Tvarateram Event
 vyzemby_flavour.23.t:0 "A Silent Morning"
 vyzemby_flavour.23.d:0 "At first, it was entirely understandable when [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not arrive for his breakfast. The great feast in the Royal Shrine the previous night had been quite the affair. A marvelous fruit of his beloved sister Malala’s labor and talents. However, when lunch came and went the royal advisors started to worry. Yet they did not act. It was not their place to disturb his Majesty, after all.\n\nBut as the Sun had just reached its crest, worries became fears. In a fret, the cChancellor ordered the guards to open the kKing’s chambers. Only the silence of the waning morning greeted them. The kKing was dead.\n\nNow as the day turns to dusk., our people must contend with this unfortunate tragedy. In the days to come every subject will mourn for their beloved master. Of course, none shall grieve greater than the <King>’s beloved sister. Tragically, with our great king dead and no legitimate heir, Malala must ascend to the throne. A truly, truly heavy burden. A burden made heavier by vile enemies of the state. Faithless courtiers whisper that there is something false about her grief. They could not be more wrong. Why else would our virtuous queen have ordered a thorough investigation of the incident appointing her most trusted advisors at its head?"

 #Ravelianism in Fahvanosy
 vyzemby_flavour.24.t:0 "New Religion from our Brothers in Cannor"
 vyzemby_flavour.24.d:0 "After the First Contact, many ships came from our brothers in Cannor: to exchange goods or ideas, or just to reach a friendly port on their journey around Sarhal or even to far Haless. Every month dozens and dozens of ships arrive and this growing Cannorian influence can be seen in the bones of the city itself, with many buildings being a mix of Vyzemby and Cannorian halfling architecture. The most famous of these is the Shrine of Begga, an esteemed Cannorian cousin of our Great Family.\n\nThus when ships from Beepeck arrived in Loranakodro a few months ago, everything seemed normal at first. That was, until a group of passengers got off the ships preaching that our gods are mere aspects of one single god. In hardly any time at all they have begun to gather followers and many of our subjects have taken a great interest in this new religion. As happened decades ago with canonization of Begga, today once again our nation is at a religious crossroads. Acceptance of this new faith might give us a lot of new opportunities, with our country becoming a gateway for Cannorian trade and ideas in Sarhal. However, doing so might upset the existing religious establishment."

 #Sisters of Lel do Enahelibe

 vyzemby_flavour.19.d:0 "The dance of Enahelibe performed by the Sister of Lel takes on a different meaning to the Vyzemby in times of strife. In peace it’s a fertility dance, calling to mind harmony and nature. It’s a time to celebrate the pure beauty in love. It does not lose these elements in difficult times, but instead places greater emphasis on the bonds of love, and how together you can build a better future for your offspring. This is why the Sisters continue to perform this dance in harsher times: because they remind you that tomorrow can, and will, improve."

 #Lel and Kolo
 vyzemby_flavour.20.t:0 "The Lel and Kolo"
 vyzemby_flavour.20.d:0 "At the top of the Nakavy Avo faith stand Lel and Kolo, hand-in-hand as husband and wife. In times past leaders of the faith would bless a ruler and their spouse with a rite that compared the betrothed to the married gods. This tradition fell by the wayside many years ago after a string of acrimonious ruler marriages; the final straw came when the king’s consort of Sisinybohi pushed the queen into the volcano of Afomapobo not one day after they had been blessed, ending the monarchy.\n\nThe clergy of [root] feel, however, that it is time to bring this tradition back. The marriage of [monarch] and [consort] is what all marriages should strive towards:supporting each other, fulfilling their sacred duties to both the faith and their people, and serving as an example to all Vyzemby."
 vyzemby_flavour.20.a:0 "Lel and Kolo walk amongst us again."
