Will you let them? They seek to burn our homes, enslave your sons, your daughters, and feast upon what remains like the savages they are. Will you let them? Our unity that we have found among one another, they seek to shatter and spread to the wind. Will you let them? Or will you rise up, and defend your rights, your brethren, your nation? None of us can stop them alone - but we are alone no longer! So come with me brethren, and we shall halt their charge in its tracks, and deny them their feast!"

But the smartest see a machine, a vast array of cogs and wheels that must be kept running smoothly. As our economic output reaches new heights, there begin to be jams along our roads and caravan-ways, bits of grit that cause delays and disruption, a true threat to the well-being of our people.\n\nWord has reached us from the South, of a conqueror's vast highway built to supply his troops across a continent and further, and of a mechanized rail that allows transport at never-before-seen speeds. We must take the best of these foreigners' ideas and innovate further, and build a great Triunic Road that shall allow every thing and every one to get where they need to go.""

 J33_never_again_desc: "The plains and the lakes are a land of endless bounty - rolling plains and grasslands, its waters brim with fish, and its mighty forests house game and the finest of trees. It is a land to be desired, to be envied. The Khamgunai and the Zabatlari both came here as conquerors. Ever since, it has been the birthright of every triunic to reap the benefits of the land they proudly call home. But the centaur stampede halted that dream. Our ancestors stood no chance, and were forced into exile, weak, and alone. No longer. The centaurs have been driven back, the gates to the plains have been secured - and with the might of our fortresses, closed. Never again shall the triunics fear for their lives, never again shall we be forced to cower and hide.""

If this likeness bears any resemblance of truth, then we are no mere vein through which it flows, but the beating heart of the world itself. From the faraway lands of Cannor in the west, to the Moduk tribes and the spirit infested lands in the east, from the frigid north where only the hardy may survive, south to the gulf of Rahen and the lands of sand and sun. Who can claim the title as the centre of the world more than us? Our ports host an armada rulers of other nation states can only dream of, and our caravans consist of brave and bold, ambitious and curious, explorers and merchants. Though some may foolishly claim that we are "outside" and "separated" from Haless, that has not been true for centuries, and will never again be so for as long as we remain; we are the centre of Haless.""

Our heartland is secured and will never again know fear. All our disperate brethren - at times long lost to us - reside under one flag - one way or another. Others too have joined us in our cause. The night sky is no longer dark, for a beacon of hope lights its path. We will overcome all hardships, no matter what. We shall become the centre of progress, and the bringers of unity to all Haless.
