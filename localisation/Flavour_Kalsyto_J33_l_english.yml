 #Missions 
 J33_great_forest_title: "The Great Forest"
 J33_great_forest_desc: "While we were forced from the mainland during the calamities centuries ago, some stayed behind in the dark forest of Yyl Möitsa, hidden from the centaurs and ogres that now dominated the Forbidden Plains. While they may be just distant kin of the Metsamics, they are kin nonetheless, and must be brought into the Triunic fold."
 J33_valley_valak_title: "Valley of the Valak"
 J33_valley_valak_desc: "It would be a lie to say that the legends of the ogres haven't weighed greatly on the minds of the Triunic people. But though they have habits we would do without, that doesn’t mean they have to be this way. If we can subdue their more troublesome natures, we would gain a great asset and benefit to the Federation."
 J33_world_we_know_title: "The World We Know"
 J33_world_we_know_desc: "While we know of the worlds beyond Yarikhoi and the steppes, we still consider this place our true home. As such, we must increase our efforts to control all of it, as this shall be the true homeland of the Triunic people, the homeland of democracy!"
 J33_land_we_love_title: "The Land We Love"
 J33_land_we_love_desc: "The nomadic nature of the centaurs meant that while the Forbidden Plains were populated, they were never settled in the way Yarikhoi was. Their settlements roamed the great steppes without the need for great roads, wells, waystations and other such infrastructure, and so we must plant these roots ourselves if we wish to prosper here."
 J33_soil_we_toil_title: "The Soil We Toil"
 J33_soil_we_toil_desc: "As we expand deeper into the Plains, and our frontier expands farther from Yarikhoi, new cultures crop up in our colonies from the intermingling of three peoples. These new men and women are children of the Plains, living proof our goals come to fruition, we are righting the wrongs of the past."
 J33_dungeons_deep_title: "Dungeons Deep"
 J33_dungeons_deep_desc: "Our scouts have reported back to us just how far the Serpentspine’s depths go, and the reports are… mixed. On one hand, they contain the riches of a fallen Dwarven Empire and the races that now inhabit it. On the other hand, it's an alien environment compared to the world outside the caves, and massive to say the least. We need to work with the locals if we even hope to gain a serious foothold there."
 J33_prehistoric_grudges_title: "Prehistoric Grudges"
 J33_prehistoric_grudges_desc: "If we thought our people’s disputes with the centaurs were bad, the hatred between the dwarves and the goblins is greater almost without measure. If we wish to contain both in our lands, we must find a way to calm this hate."
 
 J33_land_fall_title: "Landfall"
 J33_land_fall_desc: "Though Yarikhoi is our greatest and most beloved home, we must spread beyond it and its lakes to the south, east, west, and beyond. Prepare the ships, we make landfall as soon as possible."
 J33_ancient_hatred_title: "Ancient Hatred"
 J33_ancient_hatred_desc: "It was countless centuries ago when the centaurs flooded the plains, bringing fire and war in their path north, and forcing the Triunic peoples to band together in Yarikhoi, eventually forming the Lake Federation to fight them off in the 1400’s. If we wish to dominate these Plains, we must push them back."
 J33_tributaries_lakes_title: "Tributaries of the Lakes"
 J33_tributaries_lakes_desc: "The great rivers that feed our lakes span much of the Plains, with some routes even leading to the great Serpentspine mountains to the south. Using these, we can travel farther and faster!"
 J33_resources_motherland_title: "Resources of the Motherland"
 J33_resources_motherland_desc: "Yarikhoi’s lack of iron and other resources has been a limiting factor to our industry, but not anymore. Scouting parties have found sources of these materials across the Plains. If we are able to tap them properly and transport them to Yarikhoi, our industry will boom to heights beyond our wildest dreams."
 J33_wrong_world_title: "Wrong World"
 J33_wrong_world_desc: "For as long as they have existed, the centaurs have been a menace. Our ancestors were driven from their homelands, only surviving by hiding upon Yarikhoi, waiting to take their revenge. Now we are ready, and the horsemen shall pay for their crimes.\n\nWe shall not rest, we shall not falter, and we shall not turn aside. The centaurs shall be removed from the face of Halann, and the world shall be better for it."
 J33_trading_crescent_title: "The Trading Crescent"
 J33_trading_crescent_desc: "A new dawn has erupted across the lakes, and with it comes the allure of opportunity, and profit. While our ancestors were limited to either the lakes or the long and arduous journey into the horizon, current efforts have opened a new way forward. If the colonization efforts on the mainland are accelerated, markets will crop up like grain, and merchants shall spread goods from these colonies and vice versa. Like any opportunity, we need only brave men and women to seize it!"
 J33_guns_steppe_title: "Guns of the Steppe"
 J33_guns_steppe_desc: "The plains that surround much of Yarikhoi have been many things to many people. For some of our ancestors it was home, and up until recently it was a great danger. But for us? For us, this is a place where freedom is born, of the steed and the shot, a land where tyranny can never rear its ugly head. Let us begin!"
 J33_triunic_road_title: "The Triunic Road"
 J33_triunic_road_desc: "Fools look at a city and see only walls and warehouses. Those smarter see a living organism, breathing and growing. But the smartest see a machine, a vast array of cogs and wheels that must be kept running smoothly. As our economic output reaches new heights, there begin to be jams along our roads and caravan-ways, bits of grit that cause delays and disruption, a true threat to the well-being of our people.\n\nWord has reached us from the South, of a conqueror's vast highway built to supply his troops across a continent and further, and of a mechanized rail that allows transport at never-before-seen speeds. We must take the best of these foreigners' ideas and innovate further, and build a great Triunic Road that shall allow every thing and every one to get where they need to go."
 J33_never_again_title: "Never Again"
 J33_never_again_desc: "The plains and the lakes are a land of endless bounty - rolling plains and grasslands, its waters brim with fish, and its mighty forests house game and the finest of trees. It is a land to be desired, to be envied. It has been the birthright of every Triunic to reap the benefits of the land they proudly call home. But the centaur stampede halted that dream. Our ancestors stood no chance, and were forced into exile, weak and alone. No longer. The centaurs have been driven back, the gates to the plains have been secured - and with the might of our fortresses, closed. Never again shall the Triunics fear for their lives, never again shall we be forced to cower and hide."
 J33_the_individualists_title: "The Individualists"
 J33_the_individualists_desc: "While the worship of the Divine Kalyin now dominates Yarikhoi and beyond, some still cling to her three known faces prior to Her revelation. This must change. The Lake Federation must stand as one nation yet many polities, one people yet many cultures, one Goddess yet many faces."
 J33_redialue_title: "Rediälüe"
 J33_redialue_desc: "Across the rest of Haless, tyranny reigns. In Yanshen, the land is divided amongst the cruel monarchs in the west and the eunuch despots in the east. In the south, various empires and kingdoms fight for control over swathes of land. And in Rahen, the people suffer under either the decadent rule of dynastic Harimari Rajas, or the nightmarish multi-headed beast that is The Command. We shall free them."
 J33_onyx_damestear_title: "Onyx Damestear"
 J33_onyx_damestear_desc: "The question of how mages can be trusted in a society that still bears the scars of the Tyrant Queen has hung over the head of the Federation for decades, and at last there is a solution: Black Damestear. A substance that can counteract magic. No longer will the mages live under persecution, unable to do their part in society, for those who abuse their powers shall have a weakness."
 J33_common_diplomatic_policy_title: "Diplomatic Policy"
 J33_common_diplomatic_policy_desc: "While there are now many democratic states across Halann, this has created the issue of multiple contradicting diplomatic policies by each of the states that threatens to undermine our goal of spreading democracy. We shall call a council and discuss a united diplomatic policy, so that our voices may speak as Kalyin’s does, radiant and concordant."
 J33_our_constitution_title: "Our Constitution"
 J33_our_constitution_desc: "A series of decisions, a sequence of amendments, the will of the people cast onto paper, but made stronger than steel. This world has been remade in our image, and reality itself now bends to our whim. Whether we yield the scythe or sword, coin or gun, paper or voice, we are the will of Kalyin made manifest!"
 
 J33_unify_island_title: "Unify The Island"
 J33_unify_island_desc: "While we have united the federation into one state, we need to ensure all of Yarikhoi falls under our control. Whether they be Republics that have refused the call, or centaurs encroaching on our domain, we shall unite the island."
 J33_workshops_crescent_title: "Workshops of the Crescent"
 J33_workshops_crescent_desc: "Under the management of the plutocrats, the productive infrastructure of Yarikhoi suffered in favor of fattening their pockets. If we are to ever liberate all of the world's workers, we must quickly make up for this production deficit."
 J33_strategical_readiness_title: "Strategical Readiness"
 J33_strategical_readiness_desc: "The preparations are underway. Weapons and armor are being forged, plans are being drawn up, infrastructure is being maintained and built, and generals and admirals are being posted. The war to liberate Halann is being drafted as we speak, and it must be perfect."
 J33_treasure_fleet_title: "The Treasure Fleet"
 J33_treasure_fleet_desc: "It was from Zurkanrek that the first treasure fleet sailed. Since then, tradition and infrastructure alike has kept the status quo. But with the rapid expansion of the treasure fleet, the very home port that is meant to serve it seems to have an issue in keeping up with the expansionist zealotry of the merchant class.\nPerhaps it is time we intervene?"
 J33_guns_foundry_title: "Guns Foundry"
 J33_guns_foundry_desc: "If we are to produce the guns that it is the right of every man to wield, we will require forges to create them. A massive construction of weapons factories is in order, scattered across Yarikhoi near major metal deposits, allowing a decentralized, yet efficient, production of weapons."
 J33_no_one_left_behind_title: "No One Left Behind"
 J33_no_one_left_behind_desc: "Poverty is a disease that drags communities down with it. If we wish to combat this, we need to implement strict reforms and policies to our economic system to combat low income. Poverty shall be another tyranny we strike down with quill and decree."
 J33_citizens_duty_title: "A Citizen's Duty"
 J33_citizens_duty_desc: "Triunics, people of the federation! Your country needs you. The enemy stands at our gates, and seeks to once more undo all that we stand for, all that we have created. Will you let them? They seek to burn our homes, enslave your sons, your daughters, and feast upon what remains like the savages they are. Will you let them? Our unity that we have found among one another, they seek to shatter and spread to the wind. Will you let them? Or will you rise up, and defend your rights, your brethren, your nation? None of us can stop them alone - but we are alone no longer! So come with me brethren, and we shall halt their charge in its tracks, and deny them their feast!"
 J33_between_sea_and_mountain_title:0 "Between Sea and Mountain"
 J33_between_sea_and_mountain_desc:0 "To the east of our crescent, in an area referred to by the centaurs as Nuzur Bokh, lies very little population or infrastructure. It does, however, boast plentiful forests, abundant natural resources, and an extremely defensible position. We should settle this barren land, and make it a worthy compatriot to the cities of the lakes."
 J33_first_debates_title: "The First Debates"
 J33_first_debates_desc: "As the preeminent democracy on Halann, we set an example for how the system will work across the world, and as such, we must take great care as to organize these debates and show everyone the power of democratic principles!"
 J33_violet_dawn_title: "Violet Dawn"
 J33_violet_dawn_desc: "While Haless is a very foreign land to our people, our distant kin in Beikdugang give us an entrepot into Yanshen and a foothold from which to spread our ideas. They shall be from where the democratic revolution shall begin."
 J33_know_tyranny_title: "To Know Tyranny"
 J33_know_tyranny_desc: "While the Raj and Yanshen were not exactly democratic, the horror that is the Command, erupting from the northern mountains, is a horror we have not seen since the Tyrant Queen. There can be no liberty with that monster looming above everyone, and so it falls to us to end despotic evil once more."
 J33_silence_command_title: "Silence The Command"
 J33_silence_command_desc: "Many in Haless are skeptical of our motives, and we can hardly blame them! Many a tyrant in their land has feigned benevolence, only to turn abusive once their aims were achieved. But we shall prove the truth of our message, by striking down the hydra they all fear: The Command. When it falls, they shall cheer Kalyin’s name."
 J33_liberty_blossoms_title: "Liberty Blossoms"
 J33_liberty_blossoms_desc: "Across the Plains and worlds beyond, liberty and democracy spreads like a great flower unfurling in full blossom. As we step even further across Halann we should take steps to ensure this rapid expansion doesn't undercut our ideological throughput. We must not simply conquer, we must give our ways to them"
 J33_broader_approach_title: "A Broader Approach"
 J33_broader_approach_desc: "Though our expansion of democracy is fast, it is no longer as fast as we like. Wars across the world take time and resources to shift troops from one place to another. Instead, it would be a better idea to incite revolution within the people, and give them the tools to succeed."
 J33_ignite_blackpowder_title: "Ignite Blackpowder"
 J33_ignite_blackpowder_desc: "Tyranny falls at the hands of its victims, we are but merely a spark to provide such masses the opportunity. Ignite the powder keg that is Cannor, and let us watch the despotic states ignite in flames and reduce to ashes."
 J33_crumbling_crowns_title: "Crumbling Crowns"
 J33_crumbling_crowns_desc: "Across Cannor, tyrants collapse beneath the weight of their cruelty. Their people tear them down, unable to bear their oppression any longer. The time of democracy and liberty is at hand."
 J33_tyrannys_end_title: "Tyranny's End"
 J33_tyrannys_end_desc: "When the Tyrant Queen was overthrown, an inevitable chain reaction began, and at its culmination: The final end of tyranny. No longer shall kings rule over peasants, no longer shall the meek cower before the strong, no longer shall authoritarianism reign over this world. Kalyin reigns supreme, and her gaze is freedom and comfort for the masses." 
 
 J33_establishing_contacts_title: "Establishing Contacts"
 J33_establishing_contacts_desc: "Now that the Lake Federation has been consolidated, it is time to reach out to fellow republics outside of the Forbidden Plains. Though they may not be democratic, they at least have a disdain of tyrants, and that we can work with."
 J33_land_apocalypse_title: "Land of Apocalypse"
 J33_land_apocalypse_desc: "The lands of Gozengun are rife with turmoil and strife, that we know, for our Khamgunai people fled from these lands long ago. We must return there at once, and show the people there what we have made in our absence."
 J33_peer_republic_title: "A Peer Republic"
 J33_peer_republic_desc: "While our republic may span across the Plains, the world is bigger still. We need to be establishing sibling republics across our expanses, and ensure they can stand on their own feet."
 J33_mirrored_chamber_title: "The Mirrored Chamber"
 J33_mirrored_chamber_desc: "We are a reflection of Kalyin, fulfilling her will of democracy upon the world. To reflect this we should begin construction of a great glass building from which we can focus our diplomatic efforts, and display the splendor of our many-faced Goddess."
 J33_reform_parliament_title: "Reform the Parliament"
 J33_reform_parliament_desc: "While our Parliament is one of the great works of statecraft, it is not yet perfect. Through implementing rigorous reforms on this, we can ensure the Parliament becomes closer to what it is meant to be: a machine of perfect democracy."
 J33_workers_of_the_world_title: "Workers of the World"
 J33_workers_of_the_world_desc: "Our workers have proven themselves to be the finest individuals on the face of the planet. They produce more than any other society, and they labor for the freedom of all. We should spread news of this accomplishment far and wide, and spread the message of equality for all with it."
 J33_tactical_readiness_title: "Tactical Readiness"
 J33_tactical_readiness_desc: "Many a tyrant has been put to the steel already, yet many more remain. we have prepared ourselves to fight for liberty, but the world itself must now be primed and ready to march in conflict with the enemy."
 J33_global_trade_title: "Global Trade"
 J33_global_trade_desc: "It is said that trade is the lifeblood of civilization, following down long since established veins of commerce. If this likeness bears any resemblance of truth, then we are no mere vein through which it flows, but the beating heart of the world itself. From the faraway lands of Cannor in the west, to the Moduk tribes and the spirit infested lands in the east, from the frigid north where only the hardy may survive, south to the gulf of Rahen and the lands of sand and sun. Who can claim the title as the centre of the world more than us? Our ports host an armada rulers of other nation states can only dream of, and our caravans consist of brave and bold, ambitious and curious, explorers and merchants. Though some may foolishly claim that we are "outside" and "separated" from Haless, that has not been true for centuries, and will never again be so for as long as we remain; we are the centre of Haless."
 J33_make_them_equal_title: "Make Them Equal"
 J33_make_them_equal_desc: "People come in all shapes and sizes, and the discrepancy of violence meant the strong could bully the weak. With the gun comes true equality. There are no more strong and weak, only the person, and the innate rights they carry in their holster. We will arm the world and free it, for nothing drowns out the commanding tyrant more than the blast of gunpowder"
 J33_one_family_title: "One Family"
 J33_one_family_desc: "The family unit is sacred in almost all societies, and it is to us as well. We, united under kalyin, have simply redefined what that means. We are all one through Kalyin, and therefore at the fundamental level are one with all others. We wince at the suffering of others, for it is our suffering. We smile in the joy of others, for it is our joy. We go forward to help others as one ought to help themself."
 J33_crescent_upon_halann_title: "A Crescent Upon Halann"
 J33_crescent_upon_halann_desc: "The Triunic peoples have come far. From seeking a new home away from hardship and plagued by internal conflicts, to expanding our influence to ease the burden of others through our unity. Our heartland is secured and will never again know fear. All our disperate brethren, at times long lost to us, reside under one flag - one way or another. Others too have joined us in our cause. The night sky is no longer dark, for a beacon of hope lights its path. We will overcome all hardships, no matter what. We shall become the centre of progress, and the bringers of unity to all Halann. Citizens, we thank you for your contributions."
 J33_assembly_hundred_faces_title: "Assembly of a Hundred Faces"
 J33_assembly_hundred_faces_desc: "Kalyin's will guides our hands and drives our steps, and yet we cannot act alone. This world is everyone’s.  We must gather these voices, these wayward children of Kalyin’s other faces, to Yarikhoi so they too can discuss actions that will change the world."
 J33_salvation_ruin_title: "Salvation in Ruin"
 J33_salvation_ruin_desc: "The Day of Ashen Skies wiped the slate clean for many areas of Halann, but in many ways this has led the survivors to create better societies in its wake. The ruinborn still struggle under the weight of monarchs, tyrants, and despots, while newcomers from Cannor have arrived to make new lives in these lands. Perhaps we can enlighten both of these groups."
 J33_monotheism_title: "Monotheism"
 J33_monotheism_desc: "The Ravelian movement has come so close yet so far to the truth of Kalyin. They have deciphered that there is but one God, but falsely believe that she is yet to be reconstructed as was perceived by the prophetess, instead existing as a mere fragment of diminished power. We will help them reach the last step, and mend the mirror for Cannor."
 
 J33_temple_goddess_title: "Temple of the Goddess"
 J33_temple_goddess_desc: "Raattakod was once the greatest of Kodave’s temples. Now Kalyin’s truth has been revealed, we shall renovate it into one of the seats of Her faith, a beacon from which our unity shall spread across land and sea alike."
 J33_kalyins_crescent_title: "Kalyin's Crescent"
 J33_kalyins_crescent_desc: "If we wish to spread the word of Kalyin to other lands, we must be sure of it within our own. Those who deny the unity of our goddesses shall be corrected, Yarikhoi will know the truth of the Goddess that is One and Many."
 J33_one_soul_one_goddess_title: "One Soul, One Goddess"
 J33_one_soul_one_goddess_desc: "Long before the truth of Kalyin was uncovered, the people of northern Moduk knew of the Supreme Spirit which everyone was a part of. Because of this, having them understand the true name of this spirit, Kalyin, should be easy."
 J33_mere_glimpse_title: "A Mere Glimpse"
 J33_mere_glimpse_desc: "To know Kalyin is to know the universe. While we are the only ones to understand Kalyin’s truth, there are other things to be gleaned from the other faiths about Kalyin - her other faces show her other expressions, her other natures. We must gather them to know more."
 J33_those_deemed_monsters_title: "Those Deemed Monsters"
 J33_those_deemed_monsters_desc: "All are a part of Kalyin and Her universe, even those most despise as monstrous and evil. We must stand above such ideas and understand the pieces of the truth they have glimpsed."
 J33_opening_eyes_title: "Opening the Eyes"
 J33_opening_eyes_desc: "We have gleaned the countless truths of Kalyin from many people across many lands. And yet there is still more to go, and with those who do not wish to discuss with us. But we must carry on and show them the reasoning behind this, so that we may understand Kalyin fully."
 J33_adjusting_light_title: "Adjusting to the Light"
 J33_adjusting_light_desc: "As the scope of our worship expands ever further, we should begin efforts to centralise the worship of Kalyin so that everyone can better understand the scope and magnitude of the universal Goddess."
 J33_beholding_heaven_title: "Beholding Heaven"
 J33_beholding_heaven_desc: "To understand the universe is one thing, but we seek to bolster our connection to it. We are Kalyin herself, acting upon the world to shape it to our fitting. The pieces of the shattered mirror are gathered and arranged. Now they need only be shaped to perceive the universe for what it truly is."

 #Mission Events
 flavor_kalsyto.1.t: "Parliament of the Federation"
 flavor_kalsyto.1.d: "While the Federation is nominally united, factions dominate the Parliament based on what direction they want the state to head in. If we want to keep the Federation stable and strong, we need to contend with and balance these interest groups."
 flavor_kalsyto.1.a: "Let’s hope this doesn’t get out of hand"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.2.t: "Hill Watchers"
 flavor_kalsyto.2.d: "The Kukatodics of Yyl Moitsa are distantly related to the Metsamics of the Federation, and while that does make contact and diplomacy with them easier, their faith does not. If we want to bring them into the fold, we must show them the truth of Kalyin, and that their spirits are but some of her many faces."
 flavor_kalsyto.2.a: "Their faith is admirable, and will make a great addition to our understanding of Her."
 flavor_kalsyto.2.b: "What superstition!"
 J33_kukatodic_conversion_tt: "§YReligious Culture§! now gives §G+2%§! Global Missionary Strength.\n§YKalyin Worship§! Center of Reformation can now convert in §YYyl Möitsa§! region."
 
 flavor_kalsyto.3.t: "The Nature of Reclamation"
 flavor_kalsyto.3.d: "Long have the centaurs and our kind warred with one another, since even before the Day of Ashen Skies. Must we continue? With the Plains being reclaimed, there has come a debate on what to do with the centaurs. Many, of course, still hold true to their feuds, and demand we remove them. But shouldn’t we take a more pragmatic, or even tolerant, approach to this?"
 flavor_kalsyto.3.a: "We shall welcome them into the Federation!"

 flavor_kalsyto.4.t: "Those Also Native"
 flavor_kalsyto.4.d: "At last we have conquered the great valley of the ogres. While there has been bad blood between us, on account of the ogre’s… peculiar diets and customs, they too are children of the Forbidden Plains. Perhaps with their differences, the ogres would do better if they had their own state that, while aligned with our own, gave them some breathing room!"

 flavor_kalsyto.4.b: "They shall remain a part of us."
 
 flavor_kalsyto.5.t: "Friends Across the Horizon"
 flavor_kalsyto.5.d: "As Democracy expands across the Lakes, so too spreads a fervor. A fervor to spread Her divine institution to Haless, to liberate its people from robber barons and dragon hoards. Their people cry for freedom, and each tear is a tear shed by us. The people are calling to you [J33.GetTitle] to set into motion their will. What will you answer?"

 flavor_kalsyto.5.b: "As much as it pains me, the light will only shine in the Lakes"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.6.t: "Friends Across the Horizon"
 flavor_kalsyto.6.d: "Talks with the wayward republic of Beikdugang have gone very well indeed. They have agreed to our vision of Haless, and to serve as our beachhead to achieving it. It is good to know that even so far from home for so long, the vision of Yarikhoi remains."
 flavor_kalsyto.6.a: "Two siblings, united at last"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.7.t: "Face of the Supreme"
 flavor_kalsyto.7.d: "As Kalyins light expands into northern Haless, we rejoice to know She has gone before us. The locals here believe in what they call The Supreme Spirit, to which they believe they all return, and all spirits are created from, fragmented like Kalyin herself once was. Furthermore they fear spirits they call Facestealers, and how fitting then is it not, that we can finally show them the face of the one they always have worshiped?"

 flavor_kalsyto.8.a: "No one shall force us from our home any longer"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.9.t: "Squinting in the Light"
 flavor_kalsyto.9.d: "Kalyin is a Goddess of many, many faces, and the reflections of Her are known across Halann. The more we expand into new territory, the more we come to understand and harmonise with these faces, the more we come to truly understand our Goddess and our place in Her world."
 flavor_kalsyto.9.a: "Praise be to Kalyin, for her many faces reflect the world!"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.10.t: "The Liberation of Haless"
 flavor_kalsyto.10.d: "The Hobgoblin Command is an anathema to the ideals we hold in such regard. They drive their people like slaves, slaughtering their subjects whenever they show any sign of resistance against their regime. They are nothing but cruel, petty tyrants which rule through fear and pain, and we shall strike them down as such."
 flavor_kalsyto.10.a: "The Chimera shall fall, for Kalyin and all her children!"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.11.t: "Liberty in Haless"
 flavor_kalsyto.11.d1: "The Command lies dead, slain by our hand, and its people freed. The Halessi already are cheering our victory, and soon they shall be freer still. With the Command dead, there is no state in Haless powerful enough to oppose us, and with the people cheering our name, spreading our ideals should be far easier."
 flavor_kalsyto.11.d2: "The people of Haless rose up against their oppressor, and have struck down the beast that was The Command. While we were fully prepared to do so ourselves, the Halessi doing it themselves only proved our cause true: the people yearn for democracy, and we shall give it to them in due time."
 flavor_kalsyto.11.a: "May the sun rise over a freer Halann."
 
 flavor_kalsyto.12.t: "Caverns Old"
 flavor_kalsyto.12.d: "The realm of the Serpentspine was something unknown to Triunics until recently, when our scouts were able to make contact with the vast, continent spanning cave networks, centered around a collapsed Dwarven Empire. While this place contains vast wealth, the races there - dwarves, goblins, and orcs - all hate each other, and constantly war for control over great dwarven citadels and the caves around them. If we wish to spread democracy even there, we have to deal with these tensions."
 flavor_kalsyto.12.a: "A whole new world underground"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.13.t: "The Worlds of Kalyin"
 flavor_kalsyto.13.d: "Kalyin’s dominance over reality extends not only throughout the Prime Material, but also to every other plane, and that includes the spirit plane, which connects through much of Haless. The question therefore remains on the nature of the spirits: are they also Kalyin? If they are, we must work with them in Haless, even if it's inconvenient and causes trouble. If they are not, then we should seek to fight their influence on Haless and restore Kalyin’s true order."
 flavor_kalsyto.13.a: "Spirits are but a more abstract reflection of Kalyin"
 flavor_kalsyto.13.b: "Spirits are an aberration, we should not listen to them"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.14.t: "Peoples of the Serpentspine"
 flavor_kalsyto.14.d: "We have, for the past however many years, tried our hardest to make the dwarves and goblins get along, and we have completely failed. They actually hate each other more, somehow, and it's driven our bureaucrats to the brink of insanity. While getting them to tolerate one another will take centuries by our estimation, perhaps we should favor one of them in the short term, so we can better have a foothold over the Serpenspine?"
 flavor_kalsyto.14.a: "The Dwarves are the ancient rulers of this land"
 flavor_kalsyto.14.b: "The Goblins are the most widespread race of this land"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.15.t: "Conclave of a Hundred Faces"
 flavor_kalsyto.15.d: "Kalyin is in everything, and in everyone, for we have seen this already with the many faces of Her we found across Halann. We cannot simply rely on our own opinions of how to rule. As such, we have gathered people from many races and many lands to Yarikhoi, to the Conclave of a Hundred Faces, so that we may see the totality of mortal experience, and learn how to perfect our insight on the world."
 flavor_kalsyto.15.a: "We gather here one hundred, to represent one billion."
 
 flavor_kalsyto.16.t: "Triunic Inspired Revolutionaries"
 flavor_kalsyto.16.d: "The worst we could ever have imagined has arrived: revolution. Armed and supplied by the distant Kalsyto, rebels have sprang up across the country, battling and overcoming our armies. Our realm is falling, and in its place rises another pawn of the great and terrible federation from across the seas."
 flavor_kalsyto.16.a: "What-"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.17.t: "The World Ignited"
 flavor_kalsyto.17.d: "It has begun. Across the land, armed and supplied by us, the people who suffer so much under tyrants have risen up. They are storming the streets, the armories, and the citadels of the despots and their minions. But they shall not fight alone, for we never refuse the call of freedom and liberty! Muster the armies and navies, prepare the roads, we march in the name of Kalyin and Her vision."
 flavor_kalsyto.17.a: "Long live the revolution, for it is Kalyin’s will!"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.18.t: "The Concert of Cannor"
 flavor_kalsyto.18.d: "We have kicked in the rotting door of tyranny in Cannor, and the structure is close to collapse! The remaining monarchs, despots, and tyrants have rallied together, like an animal backed into a corner, and will burn everything down rather than relinquish their ill gotten power. But no matter, for we shall make them give back to the people what they have stolen, what they deprive. An era nears its close, and we shall crash upon them like the tides of every ocean we have crossed to get here."
 flavor_kalsyto.18.a: "It is time."
 
 flavor_kalsyto.19.t: "The Singular Divine"
 flavor_kalsyto.19.d: "The Cannorians have a new faith, called Ravelianism. It preaches that God was torn apart by the Elves of old, and that one of It’s pieces lies in the form of a box that speaks. And now Cannor falls under our grand peace, we have the opportunity to meet with these priests and discuss this last wayward face of Kalyin.\n\nBut in the end they are wrong on one count: God is not shattered, Kalyin is One, and Her faces stretch across the world."
 flavor_kalsyto.19.a: "We know Her faces, every one of them, at last."
 
 flavor_kalsyto.20.t: "Our Purpose"
 flavor_kalsyto.20.d1: "From the factories of the cities, to the farmlands of the hinterlands, Industry reigns. The men and women work each in their own way,  not to be abused by the visionless hand of tyrants. And while those who wish to divide may rear their ugly heads, they shall be met with the united front, for we are many, and they are few.\n\nIt’s the end of an era, and the world dawns on an age of work and cooperation."
 flavor_kalsyto.20.d2: "The sound of cannons roaring is a familiar sound, followed by volley fire and clashing steel, and the cries of victory and death. A beautiful melody that any soldier of the Federation knows by heart, a hymn that soothes the very soul. But today the cannons shall roar a different serenade. The volleys are not fired at an enemy. And the cries are not pained by bitter steel, but instead of jubilation, as the great campaign draws to an end.\n\nIt is bitter sweet, that we must now sheath our swords for a time. But we deserve some time of rest and recreation, even if our blood pumps in anticipation of the next great war, when new cries of tyranny may yet be heard.\n\nWe have made peace, but we must stay vigilant, ever prepared to take up arms anew, and never forget: If you want peace, prepare for war. "
 flavor_kalsyto.20.d3: "From port to port, city to city, Prosperity reigns. The men and women are free to trade and do business as they please, to profit from their own diligence and labor, and not have the product of their work stolen by the greedy stomach of tyrants. And while those who wish to idly hoard may rear their ugly heads, they shall be stopped by the meritocracy of our system.\n\nIt’s the end of an era, and the world dawns on an age of profit and yield."
 flavor_kalsyto.20.d4: "From the steppes to the seas of Halenn, Liberty reigns. The men and women are free to roam as they please, to decide their own destinies, and not to be contained by the petty will of tyrants. And while those who wish to oppress may rear their ugly heads, they shall be struck by the roar of our guns, and the bravery of our people.\n\nIt's the end of an era, and the world dawns on an age of democracy and liberty."
 flavor_kalsyto.20.d5: "Once we were as divided as a people, looking towards only one face of the many. Once we feared and cowered alone in our huts like the scared children we were. Once the dream was on the cusp of destruction as we tore at ourselves. But no longer. For our Mother has called us home, She taught us much, and guided us down the path of unity.\n\nNow we look upon each other, not as a desperate people falsely united in hatred, but as brothers and sisters, united under the grace of Kalyin.\n\nBlessed be Halann. Blessed be the Federation. Blessed be our mother, Kalyin."
 flavor_kalsyto.20.d6: "Citizens of the blessed federation. It is with a joyous heart that I can proclaim that we, once and for all, can look upon this world content. Look upon yourselves, and see the many faces of your fellow citizens. How diverse those who now today stand side by side with you, see their smiles as they revel in true liberty. True democracy.\n\nFreedom may not have come cheap. It is an investment, one we all so diligently worked towards. And now we reap the fruits of our labour. And what a reward. Citizens of all creeds and walks of life, united under one banner, one system. A true Federation."
 flavor_kalsyto.20.a: "Our Purpose is fulfilled!"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.21.t: "Liberty"
 flavor_kalsyto.21.d: "There are but two divine mandates: Liberty and Unity. Every citizen of the Federation knows this, deep inside their hearts. One cannot exist without the other, never truly. Tyrannies have buckled under this mantra and will continue to do so, because their people want the one thing only we can give them: democratic representation in a united state that does not discriminate. We cannot be so selfish as to not give the gifts we were given, or else we would be no better than the slaver selling slaves outside our borders.\n\n\nIt is only a matter of time before every person on Halann will know what we know, and we have never been closer. Let us unite Halann as Kalyin’s image was so long ago."
 flavor_kalsyto.21.a: "a free world is upon us"
 
 flavor_kalsyto.22.t: "The One. The All."
 flavor_kalsyto.22.d: "It is done. The world, once divided and warring, is now united and whole in its understanding of each other. Across vast land and deep sea, citizens of Republics wake, work, sleep, and live in a nation where they are represented; where they know no fear, strife or hunger, where they need no longer fight.\n\nAnd yet there is still more work to be completed! Every day this world is perfected further, the product of a peace not seen since the oldest of days. Trade flows across the world, unfettered by pirates or embargos. Diplomats greet one another as wayward siblings, united in heart and spirit. And at the center of it all, stands Yarikhoi.\n\nIn the lands of Cannor, a faith known as Ravelianism preached the idea that Heaven was some distant plane they had to open. While their aspect of Kalyin has been brought into our own, we have our own view on that idea. Heaven, paradise, is not something that can be found. It is something we, everyone on Halann, have strived to build as one. And while it has been a long and difficult voyage from the isolated refugees of a wartorn peninsula, it shall stand forever after."
 flavor_kalsyto.22.a: "Praise Kalyin, for She is us!"
