 siadan_the_talon_and_the_pen_desc:0 "We have been running into more and more problems as the borders of Siádan expand, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows that an army is just as vulnerable to defeat off the battlefield as on it. Should we not fix this growing problem, Siádan may fracture before we can achieve our glory. Let us grant greater powers to the different flocks of Siádan, so that they may better govern our territory - a patchwork measure, to be sure, but a necessary one."

 siadan_paperwork_on_the_march_desc:0 "There is a more trivial side to our conquests - paperwork. With Siádan's borders expanding by the day, soldiers must be allocated, supply lines drawn, edicts issued... and we require an administration that is up to the task of handling all of that busywork. The tribes have proved worthy of a patchwork measure, but in truth, we need some sort of professional corps, who can stand above petty tribal squabbles."

By burning the city to the ground, we will send a message to all of Bulwar that we are not to be messed with – and that like their precious phoenixes, Siadanlén has returned stronger than ever."

And, befitting the new Siádan that does not stand idle, and does not wait for its destiny to come to it, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decided to do away with the useless tradition of only adding to the Crest of Ištara on the ascension of a new leader. Instead, its glory will grow tall with the blood of our enemies."

But with time, an opportunity has arisen - the Command. A vast host of soldiers, whose realm exists only to fuel their conquest, the hobgoblin state's similarities to this new Siádan are striking, and they would make incredible allies for our invasion into the Raj.\n\nBy striking up a preliminary alliance, and making our usefulness known to the hobgoblins, we can forge a grand alliance, bound in blood, and skewer the Raj between us. While Zokka was a fool, and beneath us in truth, any harpy can see that the Command is not so. Today, they are our betters - and one day, they will be our equal."

 siadan_the_second_blood_pact_title:0 "Ladies of the Paravimvata"
 siadan_the_second_blood_pact_desc:0 "Once, the Siadúnan harpies claimed control of the entirety of the Paravimvata mountain range. The humans of the Ghankedhen lived in fear of harpy raids, and Queens of Siadanlén, Ištara Ivoryfeather among them, descended from the mountains and waged war against the lords of Rahen. While the destruction of Siadanlén ended this situation, it is now time to rectify our position across the Paravimvata – it is time we conquer Ghankedhen."

No more will the harpies be relegated to the fringes of Rahen - let us march right up to the gates of Dhenijansar, so the Raja and his petty lords will know of the power of Siádan."

But now we are a [Root.GovernmentName], and soon we shall be an empire - and an empire does not content itself with scraps.\n\nInstead, our hunt will be one of glory, one where all harpies will strive to emulate the greatest hunters in name, and deeds, and wealth; where land taken and blood spilt in the name of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and Siadanlén will be more important than the number of trinkets or concubines any individual holds."

 siadan_the_siadanlen_express_desc:0 "Harpies make excellent couriers - in fact, across the world we have been serving as such, as our race travels far and wide, and we make ourselves useful to the many peoples of the world. But in Siadanlén, that vital profession is looked down upon - why carry packages and letters when you could serve as a scout, or a soldier?\n\nThat is an unacceptable situation - an official royal courier company, the Siadanlén Express, will be founded to connect our empire with harpy wings and talon-borne packages."

Thankfully, the Two Commanders of the Chorsekhíl have come to us with an interesting proposition - they have proposed that we convert the remnants of the city into an official western headquarters for the Chorsekhíl, who have thus-far been operating out of the various urban centres of Bulwar.\n\nThe plans that have been drawn up are impressive indeed, and the new fortress would certainly serve as both a centre of military power, but also the economic and governmental hub of the Harpy Hills."

 siadan_the_siadunan_hills_desc:0 "The Harpy Hills have long been considered the "Homeland" of the harpy people. This has proven extremely problematic when it comes to governing the territory.

 siadan_the_stormtalon_guard_desc:0 "Some harpies among us are peculiar in the fact that they do not take mates as most do, instead preferring the 'company' of their kin. While they unfortunately often face discrimination from the rest of Harpy society for "not conforming to the natural order of things", Siadanlén knows that these ridiculous accusations have done nothing but deprive the state of perfectly usable soldiers – in fact, one of our advisors has gone a step further, and advocated for the founding of a new bodyguard unit for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They argue that by having these "Chorsekhu" fight in pairs, lovers standing side by side on the field of battle, they will fight twice as hard, and furthermore will not be susceptible to the influences of succession or the charms of our mates. While a fringe idea, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has nonetheless taken a liking to it – perhaps it is time she received proper protection?"

 siadan_question_of_the_sad_sur_desc:0 "With the Šad Sur, the great peaks that guard much of Bulwar from the sands of the Salahad, under our control, the question has arisen over what to do with them. Though us harpies have never truly called the region our home, the terrain is undoubtedly suited to us, and the gnolls, being mostly immune to the charms of harpy rule, are naturally unfit to be true subjects of Siadanlén.\n\nHowever, it is clear that Zokka's stewardship of the sands of the Salahad has rendered them significantly weaker in both coin and land, than they were before we altered our agreement - should we give the lands to them, and strengthen our blood-bonded ally? No matter the choice, the newly inaugurated Chorsekhíl are ready and willing to enact our will."

With our establishment of power over the old capital of the Raj, it is clear that we need a grander building in order to house the ever growing harem of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and the old Golden Palace of Dhenijansar seems the perfect place. In addition, the Harem has long been an exceptional source of advice and advisors for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] – it is likely that the establishment of a permanent centre for the harem will aid us in this."

Dhenijansar was the centre of the Harimraj for centuries, and now it will be the centre of Siadanlén, though under a different name - it shall be called Siadúnasar, and it will be our capital. Harpies will be brought from Siadúnaiún to the new city, and in time it shall become a shining beacon from which all power in the [Root.GovernmentName] radiates."

The growth of the organisation has led to a need for a permanent headquarters, from which the Two Commanders of the Chorsekhíl can manage both the defence of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and their various other responsibilities.\n\nThe Royal Barracks in Siadúnasar seem an opportune place to construct this new Chorsekhu Keep, which shall be built over the top of it, and will be a magnificent building that will strike terror into all those who would think of crossing their rightful ruler."

It is known that couriers hear many whispers on their travels and it is known that even the troublemakers of society use the [Root.GovernmentName]’s mail delivery system in "confidence" – with these factors in mind, repurposing the Imperial Courier Service into a vast internal spy network, and our couriers into agents, could prove to be a very prudent measure indeed."

Just minutes before, with a smile on her face, a messenger had notified her of what she had already suspected. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] suspected that many among her flock felt the same way. Jaddar was dead; The Jaddari – shattered; and their remaining forces retreated eastward; the protection of Elaiénna all that was saving them from complete destruction. The hated enemy of Siádan, those elven Desert Legions that had once destroyed old Siadanlén, had themselves been dealt a mortal blow.\n\nAnd all that was true - but what they did not yet realise was that Siádan had traded one shadow for another. With Zokka's victory over the Jadd, his mastery of the Far Salahad was now more secure than ever. If Siádan did not march south immediately, and reclaim the remaining lands of the Jaddari, then the dream of Siadanlén may be dead entirely, as Zokka would undoubtedly crush their ambitions and render Siádan another vassal state or border province of his new gnollish empire. When Astárta had signed the blood pact, she had done so believing that Siádan and the gnolls would share in their rewards equally - but evidently that has not been the case. And now what?\n\nAnd now what... that question was the one causing her head to hurt. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] broke away from her pacing to stumble over to a chair, slumping down in it and putting a hand to her head, deep in thought. How could Siadanlén be reclaimed, the glory of her people preserved? There was no doubt that inaction had been their last mistake. Inaction and complacency - both when Jaher crushed the old realm, and now. And if inaction and complacency had been their weakness, then...\n\nA smile formed on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s face as she realised the truth. For too long Siádan had been vultures preying on a strip of the Golden Highway, instead of looking further afield to the riches of Azka Sur or Rahen. For too long Siádan had contented itself with small-scale raids, and petty conquests and border disputes. For too long Siádan has mourned its past glory, too weak to rise up and take it back!

Zokka was dead, and Jaddar's realm now stretched from their "holy" mountain in the east to the borders of Sareyand in the west. The news was likely already spreading like a sandstorm through the camp, and it was only a matter of time before Jaddar turned back from the west, and annihilated Siádan like his grandfather had done to Siadanlén before it. And with those damned harpy allies of his, it would likely take even less time than it took Jaher! The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] shook her head vigorously and let out a groan - she had to think of something, anything!\n\nIt had been their complacency that had led them to this moment. The instant they had heard Zokka was marching against Jaddar, they should have sprung into action, but they didn't, and now they were going to pay the ultimate price. But the organisation, the militarism, the drive and firm-belief in the righteousness of their cause - these had clearly been the reasons for Jaddar's triumph in the first place - [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew that, but... inaction, lack of militarism, Lack of purpose... the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] looked up, taking her head out of her hands, as the realisation dawned on her - for too long, Siádan had been stuck in the same old ways. Small scale raids, petty border disputes - for too long, Siádan had mourned its past glory, too weak to rise up and take it back! But by the light of calamity, they had been shown a better way, and even better they had been shown the truth.\n\nSiadan has the organisation - its forces were organised into flocks, and if the lesser matriarchs could be convinced of the need, a great host could be raised at a moments notice! Siádan has the militarism - they were harpies, for Firanya's sake. It was their life's goal to hunt and fight and seize anything not freely given! And they certainly have the purpose! That glorious purpose that had cast the largest shadow of them all on the remnants of its greatness - Siadanlén! The name of a state that once caused terror throughout Rahen and the Salahad, and by blood or talon would do so again! [Root.Monarch.GetName] rose to leave her tent, thinking of the countless orders she would need to give to make this dream a reality - and, under her breath, she thanked Jaddar for showing her the truth, and the way forward. This would be the greatest struggle the heirs of Siadúna had ever faced, more-so than even Jaher's invasion - they faced the end of their very way of life, the traditions and glory that had run uninterrupted from the age of Firanya - but Siádan would never again shy away from its destiny, even if it cost them everything."

And with the remnants of the Jaddari finally dealt with, this simmering tension has manifested itself across the sands of the Far Salahad, as gnolls and harpies clash over contested territory and caravan routes in small but significant skirmishes.\n\nYesterday, the tensions finally boiled over - Zokka himself, along with an honour guard of his most ferocious and deadly gnollish companions, arrived in Siadúnaiún and met with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] inside her tent. What occurred in that meeting is insignificant - but what is evidently clear is that the "Blood Pact" is now nothing more than a memory, and Siádan is faced with a choice - wait until Zokka subdues his eastern border for good, or go on the offensive, and force the Gnoll to bend the knee through force of arms."

The Second Blood Pact will secure that bond and secure Siádan's future, with the terms of the alliance also stating that harpy and hobgoblin populations will be exchanged between the two states. As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s blood signs the pact, and as the Grand Marshal does the same, she cannot shake the knowledge that this pact is not one signed between equals, and that eventually, one day, harpy and hobgoblin blood may mix together on the field of battle.\n\nBut that is for tomorrow - today, the world trembles."

Siadanlén had only just been reformed, and it seemed as if it was falling apart. She had expected some shock from laying down the march, but this? Across the realm, the people of Siadanlén were rebelling against their rulers; the military was overstretched, outdated, and struggling to acclimatise to a realm at peace; and officials across Siadanlén's new territories were beginning to understand just how woefully unprepared a marching administration was for civilian rule. Siadanlén had been plunged into a true malaise, and though the euphoria of reclaiming Siadanlén's lost glory had calmed the waters somewhat, anyone could tell that this was only temporary. She wondered how it had come to this - Siádan had seemed to be on an unstoppable ascent, but it was as if its wings had been clipped as soon as they pierced the clouds.\n\nWas it Siadanlén's destiny to fall just as quickly as it had risen, like the empire of Jaher? The thought alone was a terrible one... but she could not ignore it. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] slumped back in her chair and sighed. Marcher-Siádan had, in truth, been nothing more than a nomadic horde, sweeping away the top-level states that stood before it, while maintaining the customs and, in many cases, local rulers of the peoples they conquered. To the majority of its subjects, the "Glorious Siadanlén" was merely those garrison harpies who came around every so often to collect their taxes and steal their possessions, claiming "tribute." And to the majority of the harpies, their possession of the state amounted only to a mandate to act as they so pleased! That had to change, and so Siadanlén had to change as well.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] set aside the reports and opened a map of Siadanlén, commissioned more for vanity than any practical purpose, though it would certainly serve one now. Her eyes crossed the cities and towns and provinces of her realm, as she looked upon every venerable state Siádan had reduced to ruin - the Phoenix estates of Azka Sur and Sareyand, the militaristic zealotry of Jaddar, the sea-borne traders of Avhavubhiya and Davharral, the families of Ghankedhen, the debaters of Rayavashapal... and she knew what was to be done. Siádan had to modernise! To adopt the practices and policies of its vanquished enemies and make them great under harpy wings, as it once did to Jaddar and his quest for glory! The realm faces as dire a challenge as Astárta once did, and if we are to survive, we must embark on a march of a different sort."

However, our blood-bound vassal, the pact of Zokka, have long complained of the low-quality of their territory, and it may be worthwhile to augment their meagre territories with the highlands and mountains of the Šad Sur. An alternative option sees us splitting the territory half and half between our own harpy settlers and Zokka's pact. Whatever the choice is, the Chorsekhíl are eager to implement the will of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and they are already drawing up preliminary plans to implement either strategy - though they have warned that the terrain of the Šad Sur means a replacement plan may take upwards of twenty years, if it is to be done without a general revolt of the gnolls there."

For most people, most of these guarantees weren’t even granted under the pre-Siadanlén regimes – for most people, this was a genuine step towards, if not liberty, security.\n\nOf course, there was a downside, of sorts. The proclamation also made it very clear that these rights were granted benevolently towards the non-Harpy population of the [Root.GovernmentName] – that Siadanlén would, forever and always, be ruled by the daughters of Siadúna alone, and that any attempt to change this would result in an untimely demise. Nonetheless, the Proclamation has, for the first time, truly instilled the idea in some people that our rule might not be such a bad thing.

It was undeniable that this weather was the best to travel in. Every step was agony, but the real threat was from the sky, and no garrison-harpy was skilled or determined enough to brave the storm. So they walked, barely able to see 5 feet in front of their faces, barely able to raise their weapons should the need arise.\n\nThe man in front of Ranjan, Chanda, momentarily checked on his comrade before turning back. The lightning hadn't started yet, but even if it did, they would need to continue regardless. Rebelling against an enemy that had near-total domination of the sky was a most difficult endeavour - but, contrary to what they had all expected, they had run into unthinkable success. By his count, they'd wiped out 3 patrols in the past month, alongside a good amount of property damage, the "necessary" requisitioning of supplies from their harpy oppressors, and enough disruption in the local area to raise notice. Their goal originally had been merely to prove that the harpies were not invincible, so that their families might push back against the imperial talon, that they might eventually regain their sense of power, but as they gained success after success, Ranjan and his comrades had realised that they might be the spark behind something even greater.\n\nAs a particularly harsh round of rain pounded against Ranjan's hat, a flash of blue light blinded the rebel, as lightning obliterated a tree perhaps 200 meters to the north-west of where they were, judging by the sound. As the flash gradually cleared and Ranjan regained his limited sight, he realised he couldn't see Chanda anymore. When he rubbed at his eyes to try and clear his sight, he nearly lost his hat. And when he realised that Chandra was really gone, and there was no fault on his eyes, another lightning bolt rocked his ears, striking the ground not 10 meters behind him. And when he looked behind him and saw that the woman who had been following him was gone too, he realised that it was already over - Ranjan turned away from the column, dropped his pack and weapon, and ran.\n\nHe only made it a hundred meters or so before he tripped, falling face first into the mud. He tried to scramble up and ended up falling on his back, the rain pounding on his face, clearing away the dirt and grime and tears. Ranjan went limp, and gave up. He watched idly as a harpy, clad in storm-black armour, descended on him, her talons sinking into his body. The harpy stood over the rebel, readied her spear, and thrust it into Ranjan's heart. He barely had time to register the act before he was dead. The Chorsekhu drew back her spear, turned, and flew back into the storm."

First were the auxiliaries - gnollish troops from Siadanlén's old blood-bonded ally, Zokka, with their bared teeth and sand-sharpened weapons. The Harimari followed, the orange of their fur contrasted against richly coloured silks and ornate armour. Next were the Dwarves of Gulan and the Serpentspine, who shone in gilded and masterful craftsmanship. Then came the Harpies: The regiments of the New Harpy Army, in their standardised armour and weapons - tens of thousands of them marched and sang in near-perfect synchrony, the very image of a disciplined and professional army.\n\nThen came the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], carried in a raised platform by her soldiers, her majesty displayed for all to see - those who were nearer the front of the route could hear the sound of her approach, as her subjects devolved into crazed adulation at her presence, scrambling over each other for a better view of their sovereign. Members of the imperial family trailed behind, guarded by a Chorsekhíl honour guard, who marched in pairs and brandished their storm-black armour. And then, finally, came the members of the harem - the richest and most beautiful of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s subjects, guarded by mercenaries and harpy irregulars alike.\n\nAt the head of the triumphal route stood a specially constructed parade ground, embellished with every aspect of the glory of Siadanlén, constructed in the same style as Siadúnasar was, all those years ago. It was here that the sheer scale of the event made itself clear. The grounds had room for the 120,000 soldiers, of course, but also nearly a million spectators, mostly arriving from Siadúnasar and the surrounding countryside. The full might and resources of the [Root.GovernmentName] had been assembled to provide for the mass of people at Parusapa, the New Harpy Army's logistics and supply corps nearly exhausting the food and water supplies of the nearby regions, even opening the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’ storehouses for the event - and to call the result impressive would be an understatement.\n\nAt last she reached the great Triumphal Structure and ascended the steps to her throne.

The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] thought of how many of those folk were at Parusapa yesterday, where the full might and glory of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and her [Root.GovernmentName] was displayed.

If Astárta knew that her descendants would rule over an eternal autocracy, topple the Command, or outshine the legacy of Jaher?\n\nShe turned back from the balcony, her attention shifting to her desk, where, next to a stack of history books and a few geographical accounts, a document calling for the conquest of some far flung place lay. She had been reading through those histories just minutes before - she had read about how Siádan transformed from what was essentially a nomadic horde to a true state, a [Root.GovernmentName], through its conquests of Siadanlén's old territories. The necessities of its conquests of the Raj and Bulwar had transformed it even further, into a bureaucratic empire in the vein of Jaher and Harimar, and now, perhaps, it was transforming into something greater. The Command had fallen, while the west had been reduced to a state of tranquility, the ancient homeland of Firanya secured. And still, some in the empire thirsted for war and conquest and a thousand more troubles. When she had met with the Chorsekhíl, they had asked of "next steps", and when [Root.Monarch.GetName] had brushed her commanders aside, she had felt shame. Had she been growing soft? Content?\n\nShe walked back to her desk, to the document that would have signalled a new campaign, and cast it into a nearby brazier. She was not growing soft. She was not merely content. Maybe she would embark on grand new conquests, and maybe her and her descendants would one day sit on the Dove Throne, or walk the halls of the High Temple at Tianlou! But not today, and not tomorrow either. Siadanlén did not conquer for the sake of it, or because it liked the taste of blood - it conquered to better itself, to ascend to new heights, not to grab at the dirt on the ground!

The Grand Harem dominated one part of the skyline, a sign of the power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Siadanlén, while the Chorsekhu Keep towered over the old Royal Barracks it had been built over the top of, itself converted into the headquarters of the surface dwelling city watch. The Golden Palace had been converted to a center of administration, the executor of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s will.\n\nDhenijansar was no more, and not just in name - in its place was Siadúnasar, the Harpy City. It was the new center of harpykind, of power, and of Siadanlén - all one had to do was look upon its magnificence to know they were the same thing."

One of them nodded, turning to her lover-partner. "That should be the last of them. Let's head back to the commanders with a report, and hopefully we'll get reposted somewhere less boring. You want to get something to eat?" The Chorsekhu trailed off when she noticed her partner's expression. "Are you alright, Élka? You look down."\n"Šíde... I just had a thought. Have you looked at our armour recently?"\n"Well, no... I mean - a bit. What about it?"\n"It's just... does it need to be so black...? And... menacing?" Élka took her helmet off.\n"Well we have to be menacing - we're the Chorsekhu! We serve the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! Protect her subjects!"\n"No, but... the insignia - don't the lightning bolts just look a little... sinister?" Élka showed her partner the Chorsekhu insignia on the side of the helmet - two lightning bolts crossing a harpy's talons, a human skull in its grasp. "And... well... about protecting her subjects... didn't we just evict some of those subjects from their ancestral homes?"\n"Evict? Well, this was just... just a..." Šíde looked back towards the gnolls. One of the children was looking straight at her, holding what looked to be a hound pup in their hands, with tears in their eyes. One of the other Chorsekhu walked up to the gnoll-child and kicked them in the back, sending them running back to their family. She turned back to Élka. "... a forced displacement?"\n Élka looked deep into her lover's eyes. "Šíde... are we the baddies?"\nŠíde remembered those surrendering rebels that they had killed to set an example for the local population. Then she looked over to the Chorsekhu who had just kicked that child; the gnoll's pet escaped the grasp of a child and ran towards the pair. One of the harpies kicked the hound in the head, laughed, ran it through with her spear, and threw the corpse back to the crying child.\nA hollow look formed on Šíde's face as she turned back to Élka, who had a grave look on her face. Šíde tried to speak, but couldn't form any words. She sighed, gave up, and then, as if on cue, the pair turned around, and flew off into the desert."

Harpies born of orcs are rare among the Siadúnans, and yet the few orcish-born harpies are nearly always much stronger than their sisters of non-orcish paternity.

The Second Blood Pact will secure that bond and secure Siádan's future, with the terms of the alliance also stating that harpy and hobgoblin populations will be exchanged between the two states. As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s blood signs the pact, and as the Grand Marshal does the same, she cannot shake the knowledge that this pact is not one signed between equals, and that eventually, one day, harpy and hobgoblin blood may mix together on the field of battle.\n\nBut that is for tomorrow - today, the world trembles."

While this would also have the added benefit of maintaining the old "centre of gravity" of the realm, we may find that the areas around Siadúnasar might be more costly to govern with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] absent for some of the year, and some key governmental offices still in the old capital."
