 siadan_the_talon_and_the_pen_desc:0 "We have been running into more and more problems as the borders of Siadan expand, and the Matriarch knows that an army is just as vulnerable to defeat off the battlefield as on it. Should we not fix this growing problem, Siadan may fracture before we can achieve our glory. Let us grant greater powers to the different flocks of Siadan, so that they may better govern our territory - a patchwork measure, to be sure, but a necessary one."

 siadan_paperwork_on_the_march_desc:0 "There is a more trivial side to our conquests - paperwork. With Siadan's borders expanding by the day, soldiers must be allocated, supply lines drawn, edicts issued... and we require an administration that is up to the task of handling all of that busywork. The tribes have proved worthy of a patchwork measure, but in truth, we need some sort of professional corps, who can stand above petty tribal squabbles."

Corruption, moral and martial decay - the time is ripe for us to march west. Some whisper of a coming age of eclipse - dark days ahead for the lands of Bulwar. And they would be right - may our feathers block out the sun!"

Many of his subjects will make fine mates - the rest fine slaves - and the city? As Jexis was once 'tempered' in the flames of the Ash Palace, the Crest of Siadan will be tempered in the ashes of Sareyand. Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust. And let no sun elf forget, that if they stand against us, they will be cast into the fires as well!"

 siadan_ready_the_host_desc:0 "For 300 years, Siadan has sat idle, hiding along the edge of the Salahad in destitution, picking over the scraps of caravans like vultures. We are not vultures. We are harpies - and harpies do not settle for scraps. Astarta has signed a pact of blood, and the flock prepares for war - let us call the banners, ready our spears - and march to reclaim our destiny, with one word on their lips - Siadanlen!"

And, befitting the new Siadan, that does not stand idle, and does not wait for its destiny to come to it, the Matriarch has decided to do away with the useless tradition of only adding to the Crest of Ištara on the ascension of a new leader. Instead, its glory will grow tall with the blood of our enemies."

They think their sun-god can protect them from the "malevolent dark", but when our arrows and wings eclipse their precious Surael, they shall be without recourse, and they shall be scattered, and their children shall be dashed against the stones of their holy mountain, and their legacy shall be reduced to a footnote in Siadan's rise.\n\nAnd when this great struggle shall be over, and the ringleaders of the Jadd adorn the path to the Mountain of Clear Sight, Siadan will looks outwards - to the west, the east... and the Crest of Ištara will grow evermore glorious."

 siadan_an_equal_exchange_desc:0 "We are bound in blood to our erstwhile allies, the sons of Zokka. However, the recent trifles between us, while very minor and insignificant, has resulted in us owning a large amount of territory populated by gnolls, but far better suited to either us Harpies, or our mates.

 siadan_an_age_of_siadanlen_desc:0 "It is done. Siadanlen is restored. Our glory knows no bounds, our legacy and status is reassured. It is time to end our endless march at last, as our battlecry takes on a different meaning - no longer one of hope, of future prospect and glory, but one of pride, of truth, and of the power we have seized for ourselves. For Siadanlen, the old queendom reformed! For the Age of Siadanlen!"

 siadan_and_then_refined_desc:0 "While Zokka was admirable, it will be Siadan, not the gnolls, who ascend to glory and greatness, whose wings spread across Halann and usher in an age of 'Monsters'.

 siadan_settling_the_vale_desc:0 "The 'Hero's Vale' has long been contested territory between the flocks of the Far Salahad and the Gold Dwarves of Verkal Gulan. Now that we have sacked their hold, inflicted the greatest shame upon them, and reduced them to a mere vassal of the new Siadan, let us make some slight border adjustments, move some local populations around, and perhaps overwrite some signs in the local area.\n\nWas Astarta, who allowed our ascent, not a hero? If a dwarf were to say no, any self-respecting harpy should have the right to cut their tongue out - and they should consider that express permission."

 siadan_into_the_east_desc:0 "Half of old Siadanlen lay across the Paravimvata under Ištara, but we lost those lands just as we lost the west, the realm shattered by Jaher, and all hope for its return nearly lost. But with time, an opportunity has arisen - the Command. A vast host of soldiers, whose realm exists only to fuel their conquest, the hobgoblin state's similarities to this new Siadan are striking, and they would make incredible allies for our invasion into the Raj.\n\nBy striking up a preliminary alliance, and making our usefulness known to the hobgoblins, we can forge a grand alliance, bound in blood, and skewer the Raj between us. While Zokka was a fool, and beneath us in truth, any harpy can see that the Command is not so. Today, they are our betters - and one day, they will be our equal."

 siadan_the_second_blood_pact_title:0 "Ladies of the Paravimvata"
 siadan_the_second_blood_pact_desc:0 "Once, the Siadunan harpies claimed control of the entirety of the Paravimvata mountain range. The humans of the Ghankedhen lived in fear of harpy raids, and Queens of Siadanlen, Ištara Ivoryfeather among them, descended from the mountains and waged war against the lords of Rahen. But the destruction of Siadanlen ended that nearly entirely, and Jaherian rule was subsumed by the rule of the Raj, with the Siada too weak to contest it.\n\nNow, the situation has changed - Siadan is on the march, and the Raj lies weak and decadent. Ghankedhen will be ours!"

 siadan_triumph_over_rakhadesh_desc:0 "We have conquered the lands that Ištara Ivoryfeather once held in Rahen, but even still this is not enough - as the Raj fractures under our advance, the city of Rayavashapal and the remainder of Rakhadesh lie open to the taking. No more will the harpies be relegated to the fringes of Rahen - let us march right up to the gates of Dhenijansar, so the Raja and his petty lords will know of the power of Siadan."

 siadan_proclamation_of_bulwar_desc:0 "If this queendom is to survive a thousand years, this ceaseless war against our subjects must cease, and if the position of the harpy race is to be secured, our mates must come to be content with our rule. It is time for a proclamation to be read from Bulwar, that will forever define the relationship between the Mardik and their betters."

 siadan_the_new_hunt_title:0 "The New Hunt"
 siadan_the_new_hunt_desc:0 "For centuries, Siadan had contented itself with raiding the caravans of the Salahad, picking over scraps and puny travellers. But now we are a queendom, and soon we shall be an empire - and an empire does not content itself with scraps.\n\nInstead, our hunt will be one of glory, one where all harpies will strive to emulate the greatest hunters in name, and deeds, and wealth. Where land taken and blood spilt in the name of the Queen and Siadanlen will be more important than the number of trinkets taken, or the frequency of relishment."

 siadan_the_siadanlen_express_title:0 "The Siadanlen Express"
 siadan_the_siadanlen_express_desc:0 "Harpies make excellent couriers - in fact, across the world we have been serving as such, as our race travels far and wide, and we make ourselves useful to the many peoples of the world. But in Siadanlen, that vital profession is looked down upon - why carry packages and letters when you could serve as a scout, or a soldier?\n\nThat is an unacceptable situation - an official royal courier company, the Siadanlen Express, will be founded, to connect our empire with harpy wings and talon-borne packages."

 siadan_true_heir_of_firanya_desc:0 "With the Harpylen shattered, and Firanya's folk subject to Siadunan law, there is now no doubt - Siadanlen is the true heir to the old harpy matriarchy, and the Empress and her line is the true heir to Firanya. May we reign for a thousand years."

 siadan_the_stormlen_title:0 "The Stormlen"
 siadan_the_stormlen_desc:0 "The old Harpylen was an impressive sight, but it suffered much damage in our taking of it. Thankfully, the Two Commanders of the Stormtalons have come to us with an interesting proposition - they have proposed that we convert the remnants of the city into an official western headquarters for the Stormtalons, who have thus-far been operating out of the various urban centers of Bulwar.\n\nThe plans that have been drawn up are impressive indeed, and the new fortress would certainly serve as both a center of military power, but also the economic and governmental hub of the Harpy Hills."

 siadan_the_siadunan_hills_title:0 "The Siadunan Hills"
 siadan_the_siadunan_hills_desc:0 "Though the harpies live gregariously in the hills, Siadanlen's near-total restrictions on the forced relishment raids that had been a key feature of their lives has resulted in a great need in the region for new brothels and Barrack-Brothels. By forcing many Firanyan harpies to go to these state establishments for relishment, we can likely impress our own culture upon them - and in no time at all they will be just as Siadunan as the rest of their kin."

 siadan_the_stormtalon_guard_title:0 "The Stormtalon Guard"
 siadan_the_stormtalon_guard_desc:0 "Some harpies among us are peculiar in the fact that they do not take mates as most do, instead preferring the 'company' of their kin. Needless to say, these harpies do not often reproduce, and unfortunately that has led to some scorn against them. However, Siadanlen does not judge, and in difference it sees opportunity.\n\nIf a harpy was not bound by any carnal desire for mates, nor motherly instinct in regards to her children, would they not be less susceptible to blackmail or persuasion? And if they were to fight side by side with their lovers, would they not be more likely to die than see themselves shamed? To strive to impress, rather than hide?\n\nTake however many we can find, give them the best arms and armour, and great training, and make them as loyal to the queen as to their lover-partners... and these new Stormtalons may be very useful indeed."

 siadan_question_of_the_sad_sur_title:0 "Question of the Šad Sur"
 siadan_question_of_the_sad_sur_desc:0 "With the Šad Sur, the great peaks that guard much of Bulwar from the sands of the Salahad, under our control, the question has arisen over what to do with them. Though us harpies have never truly called the region our home, the terrain is undoubtedly suited to us, and the gnolls, being mostly immune to the charms of harpy rule, are naturally unfit to be true subjects of Siadanlen.\n\nHowever, it is undoubtable that Zokka's stewardship of the sands of the Salahad has rendered them significantly weaker in both coin and land than they were before we altered our agreement - should we give the lands to them, and strengthen our blood-bonded ally? No matter the choice, the newly inaugurated Stormtalons are ready and willing to enact our will."

 siadan_the_great_harem_title:0 "The Great Harem"
 siadan_the_great_harem_desc:0 "Siadan's rulers have always retained some sort of harem of mates - in fact, it is common for most harpies of wealth or status to have one. Some have derided this institution as nothing more than some personal brothel for the Queen, but while the institution is undoubtedly utilised to satiate her carnal desires, it is also undoubtable that it holds a far greater significance.\n\nThe harem is a symbol of the majesty and glory of the monarch in comparison to other harpies, and also a nexus point for Mardik of note, whose young sons may attend the monarch in the hope that it will lead to some future promise of power, and of course that is tied intimately into the harem's reproductive purpose.\n\nBut above all this, there is no doubt that the advisory role of the harem-members is important - the Queen spends much time there, and those who attend to her at the harem are often well educated and quick of mind. And while the Great Harem at Siadunasar cannot yet hope to be a center of learning, there is no question that it will attract the most beautiful, smart and powerful mardik of the realm to it."

 siadan_center_of_power_title:0 "Center of Power"
 siadan_center_of_power_desc:0 "The Great Harem and Stormtalon Keep stand as monolithic structures among the streets of Siadunasar, but a shadow of Dhenijansar still remains - much of the city stands unfit for proper harpy life, as if it were any other city in Rahen or Bulwar - as the capital of Siadanlen, this is an unacceptable situation.\n\nAlready, architects have been drawing up plans for the complete renovation of Siadunasar, as both the center of power in Siadanlen, and the first true harpy city, designed for our unique biology."

 siadan_the_institutional_harem_title:0 "The Institutional Harem"
 siadan_the_institutional_harem_desc:0 "With the Empire stretching across a vast territory, with an extremely large Mardik population, it is no doubt that there exists a great many bright, innovative and dynamic individuals within our borders. And, as the Great Harem expands and swells beyond imagining, the advisory role of harem-members has fully come into its own, mates giving regular and judicious advice to the Empress both in her chambers and throughout the many halls and lounges of the Harem.\n\nIt is time to truly officialise and legitimise some of these advisorial roles, and establish the Harem as a premier institution in the Harpy Empire. And, perhaps, if the Empress is willing, permit some of our non-Stormtalon kin into the Harem - there can only be so many duels in the harem over who is to see the Queen next, and unless she is particularly keen on the words of orcs above all others, she may be getting robbed of some valuable advisors indeed."

The Stormshield shall be constructed - a network of forts, run by the Stormtalons, who will stand as an impenetrable shield agaist the west, as well as being centers for the recruitment into the Stormtalons."

If we are to stand up to the Command, the remnants of the Raj, the Sun Elves or the Cannorians, we must reform our realm, make ourselves stronger - and if we are to cement the place of the harpy race in history, if we are to live up to the legacy of Ištara and Astarta and Siaduna, we must strive to rise above the highest clouds, to spread our wings and eclipse the world as we did Sareyand. We must forge the first true Harpy Empire."

Siadan's Nest has served well as a center of administration, of a place for the Queen to stop and rest, before she moves on to another campaign, but that is all.\n\nFor a while, the Queen had debated moving her capital to Azka Sur or Rayavashapal, urban centers that could better facilitate commerce and communication - but she had understood that even a supposedly temporary move might rob the queendom of a grand prize, and now we have that prize within our possession. Dhenijansar was the center of the Harimraj for centuries, and now it will be the center of Siadanlen, though under a different name - it shall be called Siadunasar, and it will be our capital. Harpies will be brought from Siadan's Nest to the new city, and in time it shall become a shining beacon from which all power in the Empire shines."

The growth of the organisation has led to a need for a permanent headquarters, from which the Two Commanders of the Stormtalons can manage both the defence of the Queen and their various other responsibilities.\n\nThe Royal Barracks in Siadunasar seems an opportune place to construct this new Stormtalon Keep, which shall be built over the top of it, and will be a magnificent building that will strike terror into all those who would think of crossing their rightful ruler."

And, even better, the organisation has developed martial traditions and practices of their own - they are now not only loyal, but deadly proficient, a Stormtalon pair being worth 6 regular harpies in battle.\n\nThe Two Commanders of the Stormtalons have petitioned the Queen to form a combat-force of Stormtalons, so that they may fight side by side with her majesty on the battlefield, against her foes in the field. Though casualties would be difficult to replace, it is a sure thing that this force would be a force to be reckoned with."

It is known that couriers hear many whispers on their travels, it is known that even the troublemakers of society use the Empire's mail delivery system in "confidence", and it is known that harpies have a tendency to provoke men into compromising positions from which they may divulge some "confidential information" - and with these factors in mind, repurposing the Imperial Courier Service into a vast internal spy network, and our couriers into our agents, could prove to be a very prudent measure indeed."

While some argue for a refinement of the pre-existing military system, it is clear that a more radical approach must be taken - troops unfit for service must be dismissed, and the army professionalised and given the newest weapons and armour."

Just minutes before, a messenger had notified her of what she had already suspected, a smile on her face, and the Matriarch suspected that many among her flock felt the same way. Jaddar was dead. The Jaddari had been shattered, and their remaining forces had retreated east, the protection of Elayenna all that was saving them from complete destruction. The hated enemy of Siadan, those elven Desert Legions that had once destroyed old Siadanlen, had themselves been dealt a mortal blow.\n\nAnd all that was true - but what they did not yet realise was that Siadan had traded one shadow for another. With Zokka's victory over the Jadd, his mastery of the Far Salahad was now more secure than ever. If Siadan did not march south immediately, and reclaim the remaining lands of the Jaddari, then the dream of Siadanlen may be dead entirely, as Zokka would undoubtedly crush their ambitions and render Siadan another vassal state or border province of his new gnollish empire. When Astarta had signed the blood pact, she had done so believing that Siadan and the gnolls would share in their rewards equally - but evidently that has not been the case. And now what?\n\nAnd now what... that question was the one causing her head to hurt. The Matriarch broke away from her pacing to stumble over to a chair, slumping down in it and putting a hand to her head, deep in thought. How could Siadanlen be reclaimed, the glory of the Harpy race preserved? There was no doubt that inaction had been their last mistake. Inaction and complacency - both when Jaher crushed the old realm, and now. And if inaction and complacency had been their weakness, then...\n\nA smile formed on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s face as she realised the truth. For too long Siadan had been vultures preying on a strip of the Golden Highway, instead of looking further afield to the riches of Azka Sur or Rahen. For too long Siadan had contented itself with small-scale raids and petty conquests and border disputes. For too long Siadan has mourned its past glory, too weak to rise up and take it back!

The news was likely already spreading like a sandstorm through the camp, and it was only a matter of time before Jaddar turned back from the west, and annihilated Siadan like his grandfather had done to Siadanlen before it. And with those damned harpy allies of his, it would likely taken even less time than it took Jaher! The Matriarch shook her head vigorously and let out a groan - she had to think of something, anything!\n\nIt had been their complacency that had led them to this moment. The instant they had heard Zokka was marching against Jaddar, they should have sprung into action, but they didn't, and now they were going to pay the ultimate price. But the organisation, the militarism, the drive and firm-belief in the righteousness of their cause - these had clearly been the reasons for Jaddar's triumph in the first place - [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew that, but... inaction, lack of militarism, Lack of purpose... the Matriarch looked up, taking her head out of her hands, as the realisation dawned on her - for too long, Siadan had been stuck in the same old ways. Small scale raids, petty border disputes - for too long, Siadan had mourned its past glory, too weak to rise up and take it back! But by the light of calamity, they had been shown a better way, and even better they had been shown the truth.\n\nSiadan has the organisation - its forces were organised into flocks, and if the lesser matriarchs could be convinced of the need, a great host could be raised at a moments notice! Siadan has the militarism - they were harpies, for Firanya's sake. It was their life's goal to hunt and fight and seize anything not freely given! And they certainly have the purpose! That glorious purpose that had cast the largest shadow of them all on the remnants of its greatness - Siadanlen! The name of a state that once caused terror throughout Rahen and the Salahad, and by blood or talon would do so again! [Root.Monarch.GetName] rose to leave her tent, thinking of the countless orders she would need to give to make this dream a reality - and, under her breath, she thanked Jaddar for showing her the truth, and the way forward. This would be the greatest struggle the heirs of Siaduna had ever faced, more-so than even Jaher's invasion - they faced the end of their very way of life, the traditions and glory that had run uninterrupted from the age of Firanya - but Siadan would never again shy away from its destiny, even if it cost them everything."

And with the remnants of the Jaddari finally dealt with, this simmering tension has manifested itself across the sands of the Far Salahad, as gnolls and harpies clash over contested territory and caravan routes in small but significant skirmishes.\n\nYesterday, the tensions finally boiled over - Zokka himself, along with an honour guard of his most ferocious and deadly gnollish companions, arrived in Siadan's Nest, and met with the Matriarch inside her tent. What occured in that meeting is insignificant - but what is evidently clear is that the "Blood Pact" is now nothing more than a memory, and Siadan is faced with a choice - wait until Zokka subdues his eastern border for good, or go on the offensive, and force the Gnoll to bend the knee through force of arms."

Siadanlen had only just been reformed, and it seemed as if it was falling apart. She had expected some shock from laying down the march, but this? Across the realm, the local Mardik were rebelling against their rulers, the military was overstretched and outdated, and struggling to acclimatise to a realm at true peace, and officials across Siadanlen's new territories were beginning to understand just how woefully unprepared a marching administration was for civilian rule. Siadanlen had been plunged into a true malaise, and though the euphoria of reclaiming Siadanlen's lost glory had calmed the waters somewhat, as harpies maintained their trust in the Queen who gave them power, and the Mardik were too spear-shocked to properly rise up against minority rule, anyone could tell that this was only temporary. She wondered how it had come to this - Siadan had seemed to be on an unstoppable ascent, but it was as if its wings had been clipped as soon as it pierced the clouds.\n\nWas it Siadanlen's destiny to fall just as quickly as they had rose, like the empire of Jaher? The thought alone was a terrible one... but she could not ignore it. The Queen slumped back in her chair and sighed. Marcher-Siadan had, in truth, been nothing more than a nomadic horde, sweeping away the top-level states that stood before it, while maintaining the customs and, in many cases, local rulers of the peoples they conquered. To the majority of its subjects, the "Glorious Siadanlen" was merely those garrison harpies who came around every so often to abduct their menfolk and steal their possessions, claiming "tribute." And to the majority of the harpies, their possession of the state amounted only to a mandate to act as they so pleased! That had to change, and so Siadanlen had to change as well.\n\nQueen [Root.Monarch.GetName] set aside the reports and opened a map of Siadanlen, commissioned more for vanity than any practical purpose, though it would certainly serve one now. Her eyes crossed the cities and towns and provinces of her realm, as she looked upon every venerable state Siadan had reduced to ruin - the Phoenix estates of Azka Sur and Sareyand, the militaristic zealotry of Jaddar, the sea-borne traders of Avhavubhiya and Davharral, the families of Ghankedhen, the debaters of Rayavashapal... and she knew what was to be done. Siadan had to modernise! To adopt the practices and policies of its vanquished enemies, and make them great under harpy wings, as it once did to Jaddar and his quest for glory!

An alternative option sees us splitting the territory half and half between our own harpy settlers and Zokka's pact.

Ranjan had to hold his hat fast against his head, lest it be thrown into the wind, and the drumming of the rain felt as if it threatened to tear him apart. But it was undeniable that this weather was the best to travel in. Every step was agony, but the real threat was from the sky, and no garrison-harpy was skilled or determined enough to brave the storm. So they walked, barely able to see 5 feet in front of their faces, barely able to raise their weapons should the need arise.\n\nThe man in front of Ranjan, Chanda, momentarily checked on his comrade before turning back. The lightning hadn't started yet, but even if it did, they would need to continue regardless. Rebelling against an enemy that had near-total domination of the sky was a most difficult endeavour - but, contrary to what they had all expected, they had run into unthinkable success. By his count, they'd wiped out 3 patrols in the past month, alongside a good amount of property damage, the "necessary" requisitioning of supplies from their harpy oppressors, and enough disruption in the local area to raise notice. Their goal originally had been merely to prove that the harpies were not invincible, so that their families might push back against the imperial talon, that they might eventually regain their sense of power, but as they gained success after success, Ranjan and his comrades had realised that they might be the spark behind something even greater.\n\nAs a particularly harsh round of rain pounded against Ranjan's hat, a flash of blue light blinded the rebel, as lightning obliterated a tree perhaps 200 meters to the north-west of where they were, judging by the sound. As the flash gradually cleared, and Ranjan regained his limited sight, he realised he couldn't see Chanda anymore. When he rubbed at his eyes to try and clear his sight, he nearly lost his hat. And when he realised that Chandra was really gone, and there was no fault of his eyes, another lightning bolt rocked his ears, striking the ground not 10 meters behind him. And when he looked behind him, and saw that the woman who had been following him was gone too, he realised that it was already over - Ranjan turned away from the column, dropped his pack and weapon, and ran.\n\nHe only made it a hundred meters or so before he tripped, falling face first into the mud. He tried to scramble up, and ended up falling on his back, the rain pounding on his face, clearing away the dirt and grime and tears. Ranjan went limp, and gave up. He watched idly as a harpy, clad in storm-black armour, descended on him, her talons sinking into his body, ready to abduct him. He knew what Garrison birds did to rebels they captured, despite the laws and the regulations - he only hoped it would be quick.\n\nIt was. The harpy stood over the rebel, readied her spear, and thrust it into Ranjan's heart. He barely had time to register the act - barely had time to thank the spirits for their mercy - before he was dead. The Stormtalon drew back her spear, turned, and flew back into the storm."

First were the auxilliaries - gnollish troops from Siadanlen's old blood-bonded ally, Zokka, with their bared teeth and sand-sharpened weapons. The Harimari followed, the orange of their fur contrasted against richly coloured silks and ornate armours, and the Dwarves of Gulan and the Serpentspine, who shone in gilded and masterful craftsmanship. Then came the harpies. The regiments of the New Harpy Army, in their standardised armour and weapons - tens of thousands of them marched and sang in near-perfect synchrony, the very image of a disciplined and professional army.\n\nThen came the Empress, [Root.Monarch.GetName] Siadan, carried in a raised platform by her soldiers, her majesty displayed for all to see - those who were nearer the front of the route could hear the sound of her approach, as her subjects devolved into crazed adulation at her presence, scrambling over each other for a better view of their sovereign. Members of the imperial family trailed behind, guarded by a Stormtalon honour guard, who marched in pairs and brandished their storm-black armour, and then, finally, came the members of the harem - the richest and most beautiful of the Empress' subjects, guarded by mercenaries and harpy irregulars alike.\n\nAt the head of the triumphal route stood a specially constructed parade ground, embellished with every aspect of the glory of Siadanlen, constructed in the same style as Siadunasar was, all those years ago. It was here that the sheer scale of the event made itself clear. The grounds had room for the 120,000 soldiers, of course, but also nearly a million spectators, mostly arriving from Siadunasar and the surrounding countryside. The full might and resources of the Empire had been assembled to provide for the mass of people at Parusapa, the New Harpy Army's logistics and supply corps nearly exhausting the food and water supplies of the nearby regions, even opening the Empress' storehouses for the event - and to call the result impressive would be an understatement.\n\nAs the Empress and her Stormtalon honourguard arrived at the ground, her army and her people assembled for her, she disembarked the platform that had carried her till this point and, flanked by the Twin Commanders of the Stormtalons, made her way down the path carved out for her, until she at last reached the great Triumphal Structure and ascended the steps to her throne. The Crest of Ishtara had grown so large and magnificent it could not be worn - and so instead, it had been recast in the mantle of a throne, so that all might look upon it and witness the glory of Siadanlen. And as Empress [Root.Monarch.GetName] reached the symbol of her power, her Stormtalons by her side, all at Parusapa turned silent."

Even at this hour much of the city was illuminated - especially Siadunasar's undercity, which was always abuzz with activity, and whose fires of industry cast a soft glow against the white-brick and colours of the upper city. The Empress thought of how many of those folk were at Parusapa yesterday, where the full might and glory of the Empress and her empire was displayed. She wondered whether those who had built this empire had known how far Siadanlen would fly? If Astarta knew that her descendants would rule over an eternal autocracy, topple the Command, or outshine the legacy of Jaher?\n\nShe turned back from the balcony, her attention shifting to her desk, where, next to a stack of history books and a few geographical accounts, a document calling for the conquest of some far flung place lay. She had been reading through those histories just minutes before - she had read about how Siadan transformed from what was essentially a nomadic horde to a true state, a Queendom, through its conquests of Siadanlen's old territories. The necessities of its conquests of the Raj and Bulwar had transformed it even further, into a bureaucratic empire in the vein of Jaher and Harimar, and now, perhaps, it was transforming into something greater. The Command had fallen, while the west had been reduced to a state of tranquility, the ancient homeland of the harpy race secured. And still, some in the empire thirsted for war and conquest and a thousand more troubles. When she had met with the Stormtalons, they had asked of "next steps". When she had taken a member of the harem to bed, he had called her his "conqueror", as if he was goading her on to push the borders forward just a little more. And when [Root.Monarch.GetName] had brushed her commanders aside, and rolled her eyes at her concubine, she had felt shame. Had she been growing soft? Content?\n\nShe walked back to her desk, and the document that would have signalled a new campaign, and cast it into a nearby brazier. She was not growing soft. She was not merely content. Maybe she would embark on grand new conquests, and maybe her and her descendants would one day sit on the Dove Throne, or walk the halls of the High Temple at Tianlou! But not today, and not tomorrow either. Siadanlen did not conquer for the sake of it, or because it liked the taste of blood - it conquered to better itself, to ascend to new heights, not to grab at the dirt on the ground! And if that revelation was Siadanlen's New Synthesis, then so be it. As the harpy laid down on her bed to rest, she smiled - she would turn in for the night, and tomorrow she would awake to an empire at peace, its wings outstretched, eclipsing the world with its majesty."

Humans, elves and more, who lived in winding alleyways and twisting streets, covered avenues making way for a great many caravans and carts and artifice, that carried the goods of an empire. Crime dwelt here as well - but in this city even the wealth of illegality moved towards the sky, to the harpy city above, whose white brick shone in the daylight, with its great spires and towers, its walls of magnificent size, with vibrant colours of the most amazing dyes, as if the wealth of Viswall had been spent on banners and trifles alone.\n\nHere, there was not even the suggestion of livability for anyone but the harpies. Stairs were non-existent, doors lead to the open air, balconies merely landing pads for those blessed with flight. The Mardik had to be carried up, held by the claws of their betters, to work and live as their masters demanded. The Grand Harem dominated one part of the skyline, a sign of the power of the Queen, of Siadanlen, while the Stormtalon Keep towered over the old Royal Barracks it had been built over the top of, itself converted into the headquarters of the surface dwelling city watch. The Golden Palace had been converted to a center of administration, the executor of the Queen's will.\n\nDhenijansar was no more, and not just in name - in its place was Siadunasar, the Harpy City. It was the new center of harpykind, of power, and of Siadanlen - all one had to do was look upon its magnificence to know they were the same thing."

One of them nodded, turning to her lover-partner. "That should be the last of them. Let's head back to the commanders with a report, and hopefully we'll get reposted somewhere less boring. You want to get something to eat?" The Stormtalon trailed off when she noticed her partner's expression. "Are you alright, Leja? You look down."\n"Saba... I just had a thought. Have you looked at our armour recently?"\n"Well, no... I mean - a bit. What about it?"\n"It's just... does it need to be so black...? And... menacing?" Leja took her helmet off.\n"Well we have to be menacing - we're the Stormtalons! We serve the Queen! Protect her subjects!"\n"No, but... the insignia - don't the lightning bolts just look a little... sinister?" Leja showed her partner the Stormtalon insignia on the side of the helmet - two lightning bolts crossing a harpy's talons, a human skull in its grasp. "And... well... about protecting her subjects... didn't we just evict some of those subjects from their ancestral homes?"\n"Evict? Well, this was just... just a..." Saba looked back towards the gnolls. One of the children was looking straight at her, holding what looked to be a hound pup in their hands, with tears in their eyes. One of the other Stormtalons walked up to the gnoll-child and kicked them in the back, sending them running back to their family. She turned back to Leja. "... a forced displacement?"\n Leja looked deep into her lover's eyes. "Saba... are we the baddies?"\nSaba remembered those surrendering rebels that they had killed, to set an example for the local population. Then she looked over to the Stormtalons who had just kicked that child; the gnoll's pet escaped the grasp of a child and ran towards the pair. One of the harpies kicked the hound in the head, laughed, ran it through with her spear, and threw the corpse back to the crying child.\nA hollow look formed on Saba's face as she turned back to Leja, who had a grave look on her face. Saba tried to speak, but couldn't form any words. She sighed, gave up, and then, as if on cue, the pair turned around, and flew off into the desert."

While the extra muscle will be welcome, it won't significantly add to the capital's defence - but some of our advisors have nonetheless counselled in favour of allowing them here, and the reason for that is "Orcish Blood". Harpies born of Orcs are rare among the Siadunans, though the rare and usually ill-fated excursion of orcs into our hills has resulted in a small number of them in the Far Salahad over the years, and yet these harpies are nearly always much stronger than their sisters of non-orcish paternity.

While some in Siadan have decried this as shameful and traitorous, and unbecoming of true harpies, it has undeniably calmed the situation in the local area."

The Second Blood Pact will secure that bond, and secure Siadan's future, with the terms of the alliance also stating that harpy and hobgoblin populations will be exchanged between the two states. As the Matriarch's blood signs the pact, and as the Grand Marshal does the same, she cannot shake the knowledge that this pact is not one signed between equals, and that eventually, one day, harpy and hobgoblin blood may mix together on the field of battle.\n\nBut that is for tomorrow - today, the world trembles."

Not from those harpies moving to Siadunasar, who have generally found the place to their liking, but from Queen [Root.Monarch.GetName] Siadan herself. Having been hatched there, and having spent the earliest years of her childhood in the roost that overlooks the Salahad, it is expected that she have fond memories of her old home, but nobody, including the Queen herself, expected the intensity of her feelings.\n\nThough she herself has simply stated that she can "get over it", there has been recently been a proposal that Siadanlen should establish Siadunasar as the "Winter Capital" of the realm, so that the Queen may spend the summer months among the ancestral home of the Siadunan people. While this would also have the added benefit of maintaining the old "center of gravity" of the realm, we may find that the areas around Siadunasar might be more costly to govern with the Queen absent for some of the year, and some key governmental offices still in the old capital."
