 mengimonuments_events.1.d:0 ""Before Izenwez, as the legend goes, no Mengi knew what joy meant. While fun and happy things would happen but there was no sense of what they really did for our people. We simply lived our lives as slaves to great unknown masters, chained in spectral bonds. Then Amilak guided us like lambs to show how our simple tools, hammers, stakes, axes, and even crooks could break those chains. Now in remembrance of this fact we show what these crooks can do."- A statement by a gabare on why Izenwez is played.\n\nThe origins of Izenwez are hazy, evidence exists for the game's existence dating far back in fragmentary form, but whatever its origin is, it has our people enamored. From villages to large cities most have an area to play be it simple field with modified rules, to the more traditional wood lined pit, there would always be a day when 14, 7 against 7, take their crooks and play. Now with E Arenaginku Adras partially restored the game can be played like in Zenidir's time, though the stone seating is no longer cushion nor the wall lined with emerald, the hall is more than functional and ready to accept nobel and commoners alike to watch a game."

 mengimonuments_events.2.d:0 "...the crowd chants. The game is close to over with the last candle almost a puddle, the ball seems as if it spent the entire game in the air. It's 1 to 3, yet both teams play as fatigue is a word unheard. The teams counts are still seven to seven all have received the honor of injury, even from Zenidir’s, nay your box, you can see the bruises and scrapes down in the pit. Then an upset the losing team scores it's  now 2 to 3, though they still have much work to do you think to yourself. Both teams continue the ferocity checking each other with elbows to the back and kicks to the shins, despite blood drawn no illegal moves have been done. The ball is slung one last time as the horn is blown, though it misses its mark, you can't but feel proud of what you have seen."
 mengimonuments_events.2.a:0 "Izenwez truly represents the martial nature of our people."

 mengimonuments_events.3.d:0 "...the crowd chants. Your focus on the game wanes as you look around the crowd, seeing joyous faces. You wave out to them and then a moment a section of the crowd comes to focus on your gesture as , before looking back to the pit. You then look around your box to see the various elites of the nation sharing glasses of Tej, for a brief moment putting their rivalries behind to enjoy the game. You then regain your focus on the game, happy in knowing what Izenwez can bring."

 mengimonuments_events.4.d:0 "...the crowd chants for the final time tonight. The game has ended, you watch as men women and children file out of the great hall and down the slopes of the mountain. From your vantage you see them file down into the various towns and villages into the valley below. Your approchen then by the leader of one of these valley towns he thanks you for restarting the games has allowed his town in the valley below to make substantial wealth for the various traders and travelers from surrounding kingdoms and they want to present a gift to you personally. Before you can say anything he presents the wealth to you and makes his way down to the valley."

 mengimonuments_events.5.d:0 "...the crowd chants. Now the emerald walls are fully restored. The images of heroes and members of the Warhost of Wind adorn it in all their viridescent glory. Their actions and deeds are all looked upon by the masses serving as inspiration for all peoples both foreign and domestic. Their majesty even inspires you, their stories filling you with determination as it does for all in the hall. Now you look back to the pit to see the players struggling against each other knowing in your heart why they play."
