 mengimonuments_events.1.t:0 "The first of many more."
 mengimonuments_events.1.d:0 ""Before Izenwez, the legend goes, no Mengi knew what joy meant. While fun and happy things would happen, there was no sense of what they really did for our people. We simply lived our lives as slaves to great unknown masters, chained in spectral bonds. Then Amilak guided us like lambs to show how our simple tools, hammers, stakes, axes, and even crooks could break those chains. In remembrance of this fact we show what these crooks can do."- An anonymous gabare. \n\nThe origins of Izenwez are hazy; fragmentary evidence exists for the game's existence dating very far back, but whatever its origin is, it has our people enamored. From villages to large cities, most have an area to play, be it a simple field with modified rules to the more traditional wood-lined pit. Countless times a month and on festival days 14 people, 7 against 7, take their crooks and play. Now with E Arenaginku Adras partially restored, the game can be played as it was in Zenidir's time. Though the stone seating is no longer cushioned, the wall no longer lined with emerald, the hall is more than functional and ready to accept nobility and commoners alike to watch a game."
 mengimonuments_events.1.a:0 "And many more here after"

 mengimonuments_events.2.t:0 "Izenwez! Izenwez! Izenwez!"
 mengimonuments_events.2.d:0 "...the crowd chants. The game is close to over with the last candle almost a puddle, the ball seems as if it has spent the entire game in the air. It's 1 to 3, yet both teams play as if fatigue were merely a word unheard. The team counts are still seven to seven, yet all have received the honor of injury. Even from Zenidir’s box - nay, yours - you can see the bruises and scrapes down in the pit. Suddenly, an upset; the losing team scores. It's now 2 to 3, though they still have much work to do. Both teams continue the ferocity, checking each other with elbows to the back and kicks to the shins. The ball is slung one last time as the horn is blown; though it misses its mark, you can't but feel proud of what you have seen."
 mengimonuments_events.2.a:0 "Izenwez truly represents the martial nature of our people."

 mengimonuments_events.3.d:0 "...the crowd chants. Your focus on the game wanes as you look around the crowd, seeing joyous faces. You wave out to them, and for a moment a section of the crowd is watching you, cheering, before shifting their gaze back to the pit. You look around your box to see the various elites of the nation sharing glasses of tej; for a brief moment putting their rivalries behind to enjoy the game. Somebody scores, and you’re consumed in the game again, happy in knowing what Izenwez can bring."
 mengimonuments_events.3.a:0 "Izenwez can always help unify the nation."

 mengimonuments_events.4.d:0 "...the crowd chants for the final time tonight. The game has ended; you watch as men women and children file out of the great hall and down the slopes of the mountain. From your vantage you see them file down into the various towns and villages into the valley below. You are approached then by the leader of one of these valley towns; the restarted games have allowed his town in the valley below to make substantial wealth from the various traders and travelers from surrounding kingdoms, and they want to present a gift to you personally. Before you can say anything he presents the wealth to you and makes his way down to the valley."
 mengimonuments_events.4.a:0 "Izenwez can bring wealth to the nation."

 mengimonuments_events.5.d:0 "...the crowd chants. Now the emerald walls are fully restored. The images of heroes and members of the Warhost of Wind adorn it in all their viridescent glory. Their actions and deeds are looked upon by the masses, serving as inspiration for all peoples both foreign and domestic. Their majesty inspires even you, their stories filling you with determination as they do for all in the hall. Now you look back to the pit to see the players struggling against each other, knowing in your heart why they play."
 mengimonuments_events.5.a:0 "Izenwez represents the determination and majesty of our people."

 mengi_flavor_events.1.t:0 "Crypto-Shadow Pact Members"
 mengi_flavor_events.1.desc:0 "Before Zenidir's rule, many unscrupulous men made deals with and even worshiped those shadowy beings and unknown evils hailing from what would become Yrilak’s domain. During his rule, attempts were made to convert these various shadow worshipers and bring them into Amilak's light. Most of these attempts were successful, but over time it has become clear that some never gave up this reverence for shadow. Now [shadow_pact_perc_possible.GetName] has shown its true colors, allegedly hosting a large community of those who still meddle with evil forces and need to be cleansed of their influence. "
 mengi_flavor_events.1.a:0 "Rally faithful men in the area to let them know Amilak's way."
 mengi_flavor_events.1.b:0 "Send in a local band of Riyitewag in order to teach them Amilak's way."
 mengi_flavor_events.1.c:0 "These reports are inconclusive, to rush in and crush them would only hurt Amilak's faithful. "

 mengi_flavor_events.2.t:0 "Lions and Tigers and Hyenas (oh my)"
 mengi_flavor_events.2.desc:0 "Among our people there is a classic debate talked about by everyone from farmers to learned men alike; which hunts the best, a tiger, a hyena, or a lion? A tiger is strong and silent, always able to get the drop on its prey, but it hunts alone, only capable of taking down what its individual strength allows. A hyena is comparatively weak on its own, but through wits and numbers can take down quarry much greater than itself, though their constant laughing announces their presence from miles away. A lion is a mix of both, the most powerful prowling on its own while the weaker in the pride hunt together, mostly silent but with a roar louder than any hyena laugh. As we have had more contact with both the harimari in the north, and the many gnolls who live in Amilak's land, this question has become more and more salient. Should the Mengi people emulate these foreign races or seek to look inwards, maintaining our position as lions? "
 mengi_flavor_events.2.a:0 "We should emulate the tiger."
 mengi_flavor_events.2.b:0 "We should emulate the hyena. "
 mengi_flavor_events.2.c:0 "We should emulate the lion. "

 mengi_flavor_events.3.t:0 "Rabble Rouser Remberers"
 mengi_flavor_events.3.desc:0 "Though defeated in 1370 many slaves in our land eventually learn the story of Abazima Sky-Eye, his enslavement at Fetengoni hands, his service in Yetmesira, his sale to Raheni merchants, and his eventual return to Yetmesira at the head of an army. Many enslaved, regardless if from Bamaliwuni, seek to emulate his actions and gain their freedom via force, we now need to put down these Rememberers otherwise the revolt may spread and threaten our kingdom."
 mengi_flavor_events.3.a:0 "As much as his story is remembered they will surely forget in no time on their own."
 mengi_flavor_events.3.b:0 "They should find that bread, gold and shattering of some chains will help them forget. "
 
 mengi_flavor_events.4.t:0 "A Scale of Star"
 mengi_flavor_events.4.desc:0 "Zenidir's death at the hands of the damestar dragon was one that will mark our region for the rest of time. Though their "fight" mostly took place within Senidmot,  occasionally debris is found as far afield as the Keygas. Today is one such day, as a humble slave approaches your entourage and presents one of the dragon's "scales" the size of their head, no doubt expecting some sort of compensation."
 mengi_flavor_events.4.a:0 "We will give them their freedom, and sell the scale."
 mengi_flavor_events.4.b:0 "We will give them their freedom, then give it to the cloud-mages."
 mengi_flavor_events.4.c:0 "We will give them their freedom, and keep it for ourselves."
 mengi_flavor_events.4.d:0 "Why give them anything when it rightfully belongs to their master?"
 
 mengi_flavor_events.5.t:0 "Penultimate Authority"
 mengi_flavor_events.5.desc:0 "The ultimate authority within Madriamilak is said to be Amilak's word alone. For the mortal Mezhi that exist within his domain, the next greatest show of one's right to rule is violence, shown both in one's personal strength and one's authority over the strong. Thus when given the chance, be it in a simple test of strength or a campaign against one's foes, any sort of royalty must be ready to show these qualities off in order to be considered legitimate."
 mengi_flavor_events.5.a:0 "Prove your authority via a personal test of strength."
 mengi_flavor_events.5.b:0 "Prove your authority via organizing a military parade."
 mengi_flavor_events.5.c:0 "Prove your authority via commanding a mock battle."
 mengi_flavor_events.5.d:0 "Prove your authority via personally drilling your officers."

 mengi_flavor_events.6.t:0 "Shadow Silt "
 mengi_flavor_events.6.desc:0 "This may be Amilak's domain, but many of his rivers have their source in Yrilak’s lands. Because of this, occasionally something modeled by Yrilak's dark influences will flow down the various rivers and wash up on our banks:monstrous fish, pitch-black fallen trees or grayish dirt  colder than ice. Most of the time such objects are mere oddities, but the influence of Yrilak is nevertheless felt far downstream from his lands. "
 mengi_flavor_events.6.a:0 "Even in Amilak's domain a dark influence can be felt."
 mengi_flavor_events.6.b:0 "As the darkness of the swamp expands, we only prosper."

 mengi_flavor_events.7.t:0 "An Initial Offer"
 mengi_flavor_events.7.desc:0 "As our country's coffers empty, acts of banditry are on the rise, and comets blaze their foreboding trail through the sky, a message from Raheni merchants has arrived. It states that they are willing to give support to us in the form of a loan for ten years if we give their merchants greater preference in our lands. While much appreciated, the question is if we can trust them, given that many of our fellow Mengi have fallen under their claws, choked by their debt or claimed outright."
 mengi_flavor_events.7.a:0 "Given our current state of affairs, we must take this deal."
 mengi_flavor_events.7.b:0 "Even if things look bad now, with such "help" they would look worse."

 mengi_flavor_events.8.t:0 "Dividends "
 mengi_flavor_events.8.desc:0 "While the full amount of our Raheni loan is not due at this moment, suspiciously well armed Raheni "merchants" have arrived in the capital. They are asking for dividends to be paid on the loan we have taken out, though they claim to be merciful and are willing to take payment other than gold to settle the dividends."
 mengi_flavor_events.8.a:0 "We will pay with gold."
 mengi_flavor_events.8.b:0 "We will pay in blood."
 mengi_flavor_events.8.c:0 "We will pay in land."
 mengi_flavor_events.8.d:0 "These dividends were never specified in the deal. "

 mengi_flavor_events.9.t:0 ""Final" Payment"
 mengi_flavor_events.9.desc:0 "The day has come for repayment of the loan. Once again the capital is filled with merchants from Rahen, though more appropriately armed this time. They come asking for the full payment of the loan, and seem unwilling to accept excuses. Though surely you could refuse to make the payment, there would likely be a great reckoning for such defiance."
 mengi_flavor_events.9.a:0 "We will pay the debt in full."
 mengi_flavor_events.9.b:0 "You were already paid in full given how you treated us."
 
 mengi_flavor_events.10.t:0 "A Troupe from Fuulmana"
 mengi_flavor_events.10.desc:0 "Fuulmana and its Glass Theater has produced many a great actor over the centuries. Though it is the progenitor of this style of theater,  it has no monopoly on it. Occasionally a troupe seeks to find their fortune in another kingdom, and today one such large troupe has arrived in our capital, intimating that they are willing and able to put on a great performance. If we accept their proposal, they claim that this would be a great boon to the capital, though they would certainly need your backing to pay for a proper set and the livelihood of their actors. As we mull whether or not we can afford it, the troupe also offers suggestions of plays they could put on, and how the play should represent who is funding it:\n-A comedy like Sikatida Mezhi, ‘Troll King’, in which a fictional king makes a deal with the hags to be as strong as a troll, but instead merely smells as strong as one. Comedy, like the one suggested, represents those who can sway with great words.\n-A tragedy like Madiwal Prish Ilbe, ‘Broken Glass Heart’, the story of two families from Fuulmana during one of its failed rebellions against Averilibet. Tragedy, like the one suggested, represents the most diligent and persevering. \n-A drama like E Izribenya, E Zavanyi, ‘The Prisoner, The Singer’ , in which a  prisoner falls in love with a beautiful singer, narratively mirroring the seduction by Amilak of one of The Queens of the Waters . Drama, like the one suggested, is supposed to represent the bold. \n-A history like Ante, E Senidey, ‘Ante, The Dragonslayer’, an account of the last Mezhi to bend to Zenidir’s rule, who gave himself the title Dragonslayer, wholeheartedly believing he could defeat Zenidir. A history obviously represents learned men."
 mengi_flavor_events.10.a:0 "I am afraid I can't afford it."
 mengi_flavor_events.10.b:0 "How about the comedy? Who does not like to laugh?"
 mengi_flavor_events.10.c:0 "A tragedy will surely bring in crowds."
 mengi_flavor_events.10.d:0 "I like the sounds of the drama, let's put that on."
 mengi_flavor_events.10.e:0 "Am I not a king and scholar? Let's go with the history. 
 mengi_play_tt.10.b:0 "Success influenced by rulers diplomacy skill."
 mengi_play_tt.10.c:0 "Success sinfluenced by rulers administrative skill." 
 mengi_play_tt.10.d:0 "Success influenced by rulers military skill."
 mengi_play_tt.10.e:0 "Success influenced by rulers personality."

 mengi_flavor_events.11.t:0 "Making a Mask"
 mengi_flavor_events.11.desc:0 "The play is fast approaching and little is left to be done; though one important task still remains:a new glass mask must be presented to the head actor as recognition of their mastery over the role. The mask is for the main or a major character of the play, usually the protagonist or antagonist, whichever role is being played by the most experienced actor. The masks are steeped in tradition and myth and should be easily recognizable to any Mengi  as representing a specific archetypal idea,rather than a specific role or person."
 mengi_flavor_events.11.a:0 "Make the mask of Ootz, The Snarling Troll."
 mengi_flavor_events.11.b:0 "Make the mask of Devi, The Cursed Woman."
 mengi_flavor_events.11.c:0 "Make the mask of Kebek, The Infirm King."
 mengi_flavor_events.11.d:0 "Make the mask of Xeze, The laughing Hyena."

 mengi_flavor_events.12.t:0 "The Crowd's Reaction "
 mengi_flavor_events.12.desc:0 "Time has come for our grand glass play to be shown to the public; over half a year of preparation has been put into the making of this event. As the crowd watches on, their reaction is one of..... "
 mengi_flavor_events.12.a:0 "thunderous celebration."
 mengi_flavor_events.12.b:0 "disappointment and jeers."
