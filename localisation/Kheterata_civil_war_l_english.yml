 khet_civil_war.1.t:0 "Nirat's Defiance"
 khet_civil_war.1.d:0 "Years of unrest have finally culminated into full on revolt! High Priest Nahab thinks our dynasty is unworthy to rule Kheterata, and has converted to Nirakhetism in a blatant disrespect of our ways, taking other disgruntled heretic subjects with him. The ever opportunistic Ahati have also joined them, hoping to receive greater influence over the court should their rebellion succeed. This must not be allowed to pass!"

 khet_civil_war.2.t:0 "March of the Faithful"
 khet_civil_war.2.d:0 "The Crodamos line have shown that they value their own interests above those of its people, its country, and worst of all the Khetarch. We must take matters into our own hands, by rallying the faithful to supplant them with a more blessed ruler. Fortunately we are not alone, for Commander Dajasht and his fellow Ahati have chosen to support our righteous cause. Together we march on Kheterat, to restore the faith!"

 khet_civil_war.3.d:0 "A small uprising in the heartlands of Kheterata has turned into a full scale war as it appears large factions within have taken to slaughtering one another over minute differences.

As a precautionary measure, we could ask Viakkoc to assist us in this endeavor in exchange for looting rights and some sacrifices."

 khet_civil_war.4.t:0 "Opportunistic Strike"
 khet_civil_war.4.d:0 "The Kheteratans are currently infighting, an opportunity that Brrtekuh seeks to take advantage of. They have asked for our assistance in raiding the coastline, and have offered us a modest share of potential plunder should we do so."

 khet_civil_war.6.d:0 "The Nirat rebellion has been vanquished by our armies, and internal peace has been restored. However, total peace is not yet achieved. There is still the matter of the gnollish raiders to our west, and once they are dealt with, it is almost assured that their brethren to the south and the opportunistic elves to the east will both attempt to take advantage of our turmoil. Ahead lies turbulent waters, but Elikhet chose us knowing we could lead our people through it."

 khet_civil_war.7.t:0 "The Redemption of Kheterat"
 khet_civil_war.7.d:0 "We have ousted the false Kheteratan kings from the capital, sending them in exile to the countryside! The High Priest entered Kheterat following the news of our success and swiftly proclaimed the Khetarch as the true king of Kheterata. It shall henceforth be the duty of the High Priest to manage matters both religious and secular under the guidance of the Khetarch's teachings, so we may always be rightfully guided by Nirakhet's kin.\n\nThe odds were against us, but our people's faith in the Divine Mother has shown its truth, and we can now begin the purification of the lands her tears nourished for us."
