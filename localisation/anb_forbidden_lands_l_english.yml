Does the army exist to protect national honour as the Sword faction argues? Or does it exist to ensure that the needs of industry are met and integral resources continue to flow? Perhaps the role of the military is to simply protect the nations trade routes to ensure the continued flow of trade. Regardless of the merits of each stance, we must decide what role the new Federation army shall serve."
 LAKE_outward_diplomacy_title:0 "Foreign Policy"
 LAKE_outward_diplomacy_desc:0 "One of the integral roles of the Federation will be representing the interests of our people to other states. How the Federation will approach its dealing with other states must be decided. Those within the Sword are pushing for a policy of overwhelming force to preempt foreign crises. Industrialists argue that the might of the Federation's industry will awe other states and procure friendly relations. Finally, those in the mercantile class suggest that as the Federation commercial might grows, states will become economically beholden to our interests. What course shall the Federation's foreign policy follow?"
 LAKE_the_constitution_title:0 "The Constitution"
 LAKE_the_constitution_desc:0 "After many years, we have finally completed the creation of the new federal constitution. This will impact the character of the Federation for innumerable years to come. Now that the political chaos that characterized our society is finally laid to rest, we can begin to look outward and consider the various challenges assailing the Federation as one unified people!"

 LAKE_draft_agricultural_reform_title:0 "Farming Changes"
 LAKE_draft_agricultural_reform_desc:0 "Successive waves of migration over the centuries have led the lakes region to be densely populated. As a result food security has always been an issue of paramount importance for all of the cities. With the foundation of the Federation, this collective challenge can now be addressed through extensive agricultural reforms. Let us draft a proposal!"
 LAKE_educate_the_farmer_title:0 "Educate the Farmers"
 LAKE_educate_the_farmer_desc:0 "Our proposed reforms of agriculture in the lakes region hinge upon the proper education of the farmers. Their current practices are short-sighted and seriously contribute to land degradation, which further exacerbates our food insecurity. We must push through sweeping changes to right this!"
 LAKE_agricultural_reform_title:0 "[Root.agricultural_reform]"
 LAKE_agricultural_reform_desc:0 "After years of drafting proposals and seeing through their implementation, our proposed overhaul of agricultural is complete. Farmers have begun to implement advances in agricultural techniques to greatly improve their crop yields without harming the land."
 LAKE_preservation_act_title:0 "[Root.preservation_act]"
 LAKE_preservation_act_desc:0 "The major impetus behind the sweeping agricultural reforms was to address food security challenges. In order to further address this challenge, the Preservation Act has been proposed that would see the adoption of a program for the purchasing of salt stores by the state to allow for widespread preserving in times of difficulty."
 LAKE_one_island_title:0 "One Island"

 LAKE_accept_our_brother_title:0 "Accept our Brother"
 LAKE_accept_our_brother_desc:0 "Division promotes weakness. This is the sentiment that led to the founding of the Lake Federation, and it is still true today. Embracing our brothers can do  only good, as our traders and mothers of soldiers can attest."
 LAKE_organize_exhibition_title:0 "Organize Exhibition"
 LAKE_organize_exhibition_desc:0 "Perhaps the best way to unite the Federation is to emphasize how great we are. We should organize a grand fair, which will showcase the exceptionalism of the Federation, where men can make whatever they dream of."
 LAKE_a_lawful_federation_title:0 "A Lawful Federation"
 LAKE_a_lawful_federation_desc:0 "If the Federation is to survive, all of its members must respect all of its laws. This extends to War Rights, which many of the more radical unifiers within our country which to see revoked. We must assure the rest of the Federation that we respect their War Rights, and thus the Federation as a whole."
 LAKE_law_and_order_title:0 "Law and Order"
 LAKE_law_and_order_desc:0 "With the success of the various economic reforms, there have been calls for the implementation of a common legal system in order to adjudicate disputes between members and ensure the fair treatment of citizens of the Federation regardless of their origins. We should begin drafting a new civil code to present to the Federation's members."
 LAKE_make_our_demands_title:0 "Make our Demands"
 LAKE_make_our_demands_desc:0 "Knowing the importance that the new Federal civil code will play, other members' delegations are also working on their own proposals.

 LAKE_the_lake_judiciary_system_desc:0 "For years the delegates have debated the merits and flaws of the various proposed codes. At long last, ours has been selected!

 LAKE_a_federation_of_peoples_title:0 "[Root.mage_b4]"
 LAKE_a_federation_of_peoples_desc:0 "Over the last few decades significant reforms have been taking place within the Federation. With the establishment of a federal judiciary system alongside the Federal Linguistic Academy, we have taken vital steps towards further political union between the Federation's members. Moreover, with the passing of much needed landholding reforms, the people are firmly behind the Federation as they know it governs for their benefit rather than the benefit of the select few. Ours is truly a Federation of the people, and for the people! We have overcome the scars of our past. The tyranny that once gripped our lands is but a distant memory, with only a single thought remaining, a pondering that finally ends today."
 LAKE_city_artisanat_title:0 "Cities Artisinat"
 LAKE_city_artisanat_desc:0 "That the Federation is driven by the cities is a certain fact. The urban nature of our people coupled with the economic clout the cities carry makes this an even more stark reality. As part of our continued efforts to support the cities and their residents, we have decided to provide the resources required to set up state workshops and factories to continue the economic growth of the Federation's cities!"
 LAKE_federation_artisan_title:0 "[Root.federation_artisan]"
 LAKE_federation_artisan_desc:0 "As the cities continue to grow and economic output continues to rise, the emergence of a genuine middle class has begun. This newly emergent class seems to have an insatiable desire for manufactured goods.

 LAKE_place_of_the_banks_title:0 "Role of the State"
 LAKE_place_of_the_banks_desc:0 "Having settled the issue of the fundamental characteristics of citizenship, attention must be turned to the second article of the constitution; the role of the state. The more traditional view holds that the role of the state is to provide security for its citizens and borders, and to protect against whatever threats might emerge be they external or domestic. Alternatively, radical elements within the Federation argue that the state should be focused on shaping and directing the nature of economic life. Finally, the members of the newly emergent and highly influential mercantile class argue that the state should be concerned with ensuring the safe and efficient flow of trade. It is time to decide what the role of the state shall be."
 LAKE_the_guilds_title:0 "The Guilds"
 LAKE_the_guilds_desc:0 "As the constitution begins to take shape, the issue of guilds has come to the forefront. Guilds have long been an integral cornerstone of economic life within the Lakes, and this has not changed with the creation of the Federation. Given the vital nature of guilds as an economic institutution, we must decide what services they will be required to provide for the Federation. Elements within the military suggest that military procurement should be given highly preferential treatment to preclude any supply problems. Industrial interests put forth the very sensible point that the guilds exist to train future generations of artisans, and this should continue to be the case. Finally, the moneyed interests are arguing that commerce is increasingly the source of major economic growth, and so their interests should be privileged."
 LAKE_role_of_the_navy_title:0 "The Settling of Disputes"
 LAKE_role_of_the_navy_desc:0 "An area of vital importance that has not yet been discussed is how private disputes shall be settled. That citizens will come into conflict and require arbitration is a given, but the nature of this arbitration is up for discussion. Certain elements within the Swords argue that the time-honoured tradition of duels will suffice to resolve interpersonal conflicts. Industrialists are pushing for an increased role of guild arbitration. Finally, the mercantile class is arguing for a greater role for the Federal judiciary in dispute resolution. What stance shall we decide for the Federation?"
 LAKE_fate_of_the_conquered_title:0 "Fate of the Conquered"
 LAKE_fate_of_the_conquered_desc:0 "As the Federation reaches new heights, we begin to look outwards. What we see are many lands and many people, all of whom would do better under our administration. But given that our largest conquests undoubtedly lay ahead, already there are arguments over how to integrate any new subjects into our domain. We must decide on a path, knowing it may determine how we treat thousands, if not millions, of new citizens."

 LAKE_federation_diplomatic_corps_title:0 "Diplomatic Corp"
 LAKE_federation_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "The Federation is still young and fragile, if is to have any hope of long-lasting longevity we must find ways to improve relations between its  disparate members.

 LAKE_the_fish_seminaries_title:0 "The Fish Seminaries"
 LAKE_the_fish_seminaries_desc:0 "For the people of the lake, no other good is as integral to daily life as fish. It acts as the cornerstone of our peoples diet, regardless of their class or standing and it provides the livelihood for untold masses. For this reason, the issue of fishing rights between the cities has long been contentious, we should begin to find some means to smooth over tensions."
 LAKE_draft_fishing_act_title:0 "Draft Fishing Act"
 LAKE_draft_fishing_act_desc:0 "After tireless discussion and compromise, we have reached an agreed upon resolution. Fishing rights will be clearly delineated both between the disparate cities of the Federation, and within the boundaries of a cities designated fishing area. Licensing and enforcement will be handled by local representatives to ensure compliance. While it will take many years to implement, these measures should go a long way in preventing disputes."
 LAKE_implement_regulation_title:0 "[Root.implement_regulation]"

 LAKE_a_cordial_federation_desc:0 "With the adoption of various much needed reforms, the Federation has begun to coalesce into something resembling a cohesive unit.

 LAKE_of_art_and_poetry_title:0 "Of Art and Poetry"

 LAKE_home_for_everyone_title:0 "Home for Everyone"
 LAKE_home_for_everyone_desc:0 "Just as providing food for the population has often been a challenge, so too has providing adequate housing. These challenges have been further exasperated by frequent Centaur invasions, and internal strife. As the Federation continues to evolve, there has been a concerted push to address this by embarking on widespread state led development projects. We should heed this advice and rectify the problem!"
 LAKE_finance_census_title:0 "Finance Census"
 LAKE_finance_census_desc:0 "As development continues forward, we have begun to realize how woefully inadequate our understanding of the populace is. We can't even keep track of our own people! How can we expect to know their challenges and needs if we don't even know they exist? We shall undertake a massive census in a bid to take a full and proper stock of our population."
 LAKE_every_man_a_landlord_title:0 "[Root.every_man_a_landlord]"
 LAKE_every_man_a_landlord_desc:0 "The completion of the development projects has led to urban renewal and greatly resolved the housing challenges of our people.

 LAKE_further_capital_improvement_title:0 "Capital Improvement"
 LAKE_further_capital_improvement_desc:0 "The urban renewal resulting from the widespread development schemes has opened the way for further improvements of the capital.

 LAKE_a_united_federation_title:0 "[Root.a_united_federation]"
 LAKE_a_united_federation_desc:0 "The preceding decades have seen concerted efforts at centralization reforms within the Federation both by us and other members have born great fruit. The development of vital federal institutions such as the judiciary, military and the adoption of integral economic reforms like free trade have contributed to conditions of overall euphoria as the Federation is clearly on the ascendant! Even now citizens call for even greater centralization to continue the progress of the past decades. Naturally we must acquiesce to these demands and continue to bring the various societal institutions under the sway of the Federal government!"
 LAKE_grant_navy_commissions_title:0 "Grant Navy Commissions"

 LAKE_trade_agreement_desc:0 "Even with the foundation of the Federation, the constituent members are still jealously guarding their trade through stifling tariffs and other prohibitive measures. So long as trade continues to be treated in such a zero-sum manner, tensions will continue to persist and the Federation will not prosper. We must devote our resources to finding a means to facilitate freer flow of trade within the Federation!"
 LAKE_internal_market_title:0 "Internal Market"
 LAKE_internal_market_desc:0 "Central to the proposed trade reforms is the creation of a genuine internal market for the free flow of goods within the Federation. This would be done by prohibiting tariffs between the cities and banning other protectionist measures like import quotas.

 LAKE_federation_observer_title:0 "Federation Observers"
 LAKE_federation_observer_desc:0 "While the Federation has now enacted a variety of policies and regulations, there is a dearth of enforcement, with no centralized system to ensure every member state is meeting its commitments.

 fed_politics.4.a:0 "Please do"
 fed_politics.4.b:0 "We can't afford the cost"

 lake.1.t:0 "The Federation Linguistic Academy"
 lake.1.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThough the peoples of the Lake Federation share a common culture, and nominally a common language as well, different regions have developed their own dialects. This has unfortunately impeded the free flow of people, information, and goods. To reduce these barriers, the Federation Linguistic Academy was founded to create a standardized, 'proper', form of the language. Certain elements of the court believe speaking the same language as our neighbors will ease our future expansion into their lands, and so they encourage us to join it. Others, however, believe in maintaining our distinctive regional character."
 lake.1.a:0 "We shall join the academy!"
 lake.1.b:0 "Absolutely not!"

 lake.2.t:0 "The Islanders Declaration"
 lake.2.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe idea of recognizing a single national identity for all citizens of the Federation has been a long-term goal of the unification movement for some time now. With the creation of the Islanders Declaration, a document that recognizes the people of the Island as a single, united nation divided only by politics rather than by culture, the opportunity to lend institutional legitimacy to this notion has never been better. We must decide whether we will back the pro-unification tendencies in this matter or remember our unique ancestral roots from before we came to inhabit the Island."
 lake.2.a:0 "Sign it!"
 lake.2.b:0 "We must not abandon our roots."

 lake.3.t:0 "Universal Clothing Distribution"
 lake.3.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe environment of the Lakes is not kind to those who are ill-prepared to face the elements. Humidity, rain, and insects all detract from the productivity of poorly-clothed laborers. While providing clothing may incur a small expense on the part of the Federation, the gains in both public morale and production should far outweigh it."
 lake.3.a:0 "So long as they know who is giving it to them..."

 lake.4.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agricultural Reforms"
 lake.4.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nWith the application of modern agricultural techniques, we can harness our abundant supply of fresh water to feed our people without depleting the soil."
 lake.4.a:0 "Great!"

 lake.5.t:0 "Preservation Act"
 lake.5.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe long-term storage of food is in the national interest, lest the State be vulnerable to the public's ire during seasons of poor harvest. By maintaining the necessary stores of salt we can begin a program of food preservation. During the next time of hardship, our foresight will doubtlessly pay off in spades."
 lake.5.a:0 "I do so love salted meats..."

 lake.6.t:0 "Judiciary System"
 lake.6.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nConvoluted, overlapping and redundant systems of law have led to arbitrary decisions, inequality, and a general sense of unfairness. A clearly written, universal law code will provide much-needed transparency. Of course, these convoluted systems have always given a certain edge to those in power, who are the only ones capable of navigating them. Successfully completing this reform will thus require an investment of political capital."
 lake.6.a:0 "A modern state requires modern laws"
 lake.6.b:0 "We're fine on our own"

 lake.7.t:0 "Artisans of the Federation"
 lake.7.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe beating heart of any advanced economy is the artisan class: those who give raw materials value by manufacturing beautiful and useful items out of them. The expanding middle class of our society has come to demand an ever-growing number of manufactured goods. With careful investment we can help our artisans meet this new demand, making them wealthier and more productive."
 lake.7.a:0 "It will make us wealthier, too."

 lake.8.t:0 "Federal Fishing Regulations"
 lake.8.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nSince time immemorial the people of the Lakes have lived in large part off the bounty of the sea. Unfortunately, the uneven distribution of fishermen has led to certain areas being considerably less productive. New Federation regulations hope to address this by establishing specific fishing zones for each community, which should help keep the numbers of fish in any one area more consistent and improve their numbers overall. Controlling access to these zones is also a great opportunity to raise additional revenues."
 lake.8.a:0 "Fish are okay, but I love additional revenues."

 lake.9.t:0 "Every Man a Landlord"
 lake.9.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nIn the past, the average citizen has had to rent their homes and lands from large, wealthy landowners. This is an unfortunate state of affairs, since it not only keeps some of our citizens in poverty, but also obligates them to private citizens. Such conflicting loyalties are archaic, as every citizen's first duty must be to the State."
 lake.9.a:0 "Oh, their adorable little cottages!"

 lake.10.t:0 "The Administrative Supply"
 lake.10.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nGreat shortages of a critical good have hampered the easy and efficient administration of our territories. Fortunately, new investments should help ease that difficulty."
 lake.10.a:0 "Wait, you mean paper?"

 lake.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] Proposes Unification"
 lake.11.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\n[From.GetName] has laid out in painstaking detail the great inefficiencies of our current system. Their delegation makes a persuasive case that the Federation's future hinges on whether we can unify as one people under one administration. They point to the need for a united front against external threats, and, of course, the potential wealth that unification could bring."
 lake.11.a:0 "A necessity."

 lake.12.t:0 "Free Trade Agreement"
 lake.12.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nA delegation from [From.GetName] has proposed a free trade agreement that would greatly relax the barriers impeding the free flow of goods across political boundaries. Theoretically, everyone should benefit. Of course, certain politically influential individuals may find the idea of new competition unappealing, and they could surely prove to be valuable allies if only we were to continue protecting them."
 lake.12.a:0 "Free trade will lead to cheaper goods and easier sales!"
 lake.12.b:0 "...but won't anyone think of the domestic industry?"

 lake.13.t:0 "The Twin Roles"
 lake.13.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThere are two types of people: those who wield weapons and those who pay for them. Both contributions are equally valid, and the time has come to choose which service we will lend to the Federation as a whole."
 lake.13.a:0 "We shall fight!"
 lake.13.b:0 "We prefer the home front."
 lake.13.c:0 "Sounds like something for other people to do."

 lake.14.t:0 "The Gleaming Banners"
 lake.14.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe era of petty militias and loosely disciplined militarizes is coming to an end. We now command a standing army of brave and faithful soldiers, but their patchwork armor and worn weapons are a sorry sight. Surely it is time for us to be faithful to them in turn and make sure they look the part?"
 lake.14.a:0 "Good equipment is both useful and fashionable."

 lake.15.t:0 "The [From.GetName] Military Reforms"
 lake.15.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\n[From.GetName], in the interest of the Federation as a whole, has developed a plan for standardizing our various fighting forces so that they might have an easier time coordinating on the battlefield. Along with these standardizations comes recommendations for new military practices which should help our military stand up against our many threats, both foreign and domestic."
 lake.15.a:0 "True power comes from soldiers' steel"

 lake.16.t:0 "Mainland Colonization"
 lake.16.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nOur ancestors once abandoned the mainland and fled to the islands on which we now make our homes. Recent developments have opened an opportunity for our people as a whole to begin the reclamation of their ancestral homes, but many argue that doing so is entirely unnecessary."
 lake.16.a:0 "We should settle the forests."
 lake.16.b:0 "We should conquer the steppe."
 lake.16.c:0 "Personally, I just adore the islands."

 lake.17.t:0 "Our Navy"
 lake.17.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nAs a maritime nation, our shipyards are constantly at work repairing and building new vessels, whether those be private fishing vessels or grand warships. As a result, the time and labor of experienced shipbuilders is a precious commodity, and we must choose whether to dedicate it mostly to the construction of our great merchant fleets or to the construction of military vessels."
 lake.17.a:0 "Military ships command the waves!"
 lake.17.b:0 "Commercial vessels bring prosperity."

 lake.18.t:0 "The Piracy Question"
 lake.18.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nPirates have been preying on our vulnerable vessels for some time now, and the situation has become untenable. Our advisors have presented us with two solutions: either we can chase them down and give them the noose, or we can pay them to go bother someone else instead."
 lake.18.a:0 "Pirates? These fine gentlemen are privateers!"
 lake.18.b:0 "These criminals will receive nothing but death!"

 lake.19.t:0 "The Anti-Piracy Act"
 lake.19.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nHaving long been a scourge to the innocent merchant vessels of the Federation, recent legal developments have made sponsoring piracy a high crime. Pirate hunters have been commissioned to destroy the last of their criminal hideouts, and justice will finally be served."
 lake.19.a:0 "Our choices will always have consequences..."

 lake.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] ask for War Rights"
 lake.20.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nA delegation from [From.GetName] came to us asking for War Rights. These would allow them to legally wage a military campaign against another member of the Federation."
 lake.20.a:0 "A shake-up is always good"
 lake.20.b:0 "And spill innocent blood? Of course not!"
 war_rights_tooltip:0 "They are allied with §G[ally1.GetName]§! §G[ally2.GetName]§! §G[ally3.GetName]§! §G[ally4.GetName]§!\nThey rivaled §R[rival1.GetName]§! §R[rival2.GetName]§! §R[rival3.GetName]§!"

 lake.21.t:0 "[From.GetName] Response"
 lake.21.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nOur delegation was well-received, and [From.GetName] has seen fit to grant us the legal recognition necessary to wage war."
 lake.21.a:0 "Great!"

 lake.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] Response"
 lake.22.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nOur diplomats were greatly disrespected by their reception in [From.GetName], which has denied us the legal recognition we needed to wage war. A grave insult!"
 lake.22.a:0 "A slight we will not easily forget"

 lake.23.t:0 "Loss of War Rights"
 lake.23.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nHaving now declared war on another member of the Federation, the War Rights we had previously received are now nullified."
 lake.23.a:0 "Understood."

 lake.27.t:0 "Unification of the Federation"
 lake.27.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nHaving declared their intention to unify the Federation, [From.GetName] has built their new State. They wish for us to join it, and in so doing participate in the betterment of all our people. Of course, giving up our independence is not going to go over well with some..."
 lake.27.a:0 "We move forward as one!"
 lake.27.b:0 "We will not recognize their so-called 'unification'"
 lakefed_integrates_you:0 "§R This will cause you to be integrated and lose the game, perish at your own will.§"

 lake.28.t:0 "Crisis in the Federation"
 lake.28.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_crisis£\nThe squabbling of petty power brokers in the Federation, without strong central leadership, has plunged it into a terrible political crisis. The institutions of the Federation have locked up as internecine conflict drives each group to seek to deny advantages to the others."
 lake.28.a:0 "We need to get out of here!"

 lake.29.t:0 "End of the Crisis"
 lake.29.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_crisis£\nThe emergence of a strong new order within the Federation has allowed business to return to normal, and now that the institutional gridlock has been resolved the crisis should soon abate."
 lake.29.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 lake.39.t:0 "End of the Federation"
 lake.39.d:0 "The Federation has been disbanded!"
 lake.39.a:0 "Our darkest hour..."
 lake.39.b:0 "A new era begins!"

 lake.40.t:0 "Federation Elections"
 lake.40.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\n[Root.GetName] will now lead the Federation for the next 4 years!"
 lake.40.a:0 "Our time to shine!"

But we do know this — at 3 AM, on the 31st of Tearfall, the city he lived in... we have no better word than 'ascended'. Once busy streets went silent. Once active markets froze in time. The song of birds, the rush of water, the burble of conversation — all ceased. The entire population of the city has simply frozen, rendered static in a world constantly in motion.\n\nTheir eyes still dart to and fro, seeming to drink in the sight of their surroundings. But aside from that, they have entered some sort of stasis — not even our strongest magics seem able to effect them, let alone get a sense of what is going on. Thankfully, this only happened in the inventor's city, and we shudder to think what it may have meant had the effect reached across our entire nation. With no other option, it seems we must leave the once-thriving city as a monument to genius, and the madness unique to it."

However, as the peoples of our federation united, we looked beyond our borders - and soon incursions into their lands began. At times as friends, at times as enemies. Their lands are now subjugated and ours, but the will of the Moduk is strong. They have accepted that the triunics are superior militarily, and have instead opted to play on past relations to now be seen as equals within the federation. They ask to be treated as equals, that their culture be accepted, and that we recognize their name as "Besholgi" and not "Moduk". The voices of the people are divided. Those hardliners who oppose the motion claim that "The Moduk will introduce unnecessary diversion, which will only sow division.", while their opposition claims that "The Besholgi have long stood with us as allies and partners." Both views are valid in their own right. The Moduk are sure to resist us should we exhaust their last hope of preserving their ways of life, but there is no guarantee that the clans will fall in line to our authority. What fate shall we bestow the people of the Moduk?"

Though costly, it will surely help improve the lives of our citizens in the region."

It is becoming ever more evident that the Federation and its people will need to confront the ghosts of the past, sooner rather than later. By launching an investigation into the relations between ordinary people and the mages of our land we will be better prepared to face the needs and desires of our population... or manipulate their perceptions, should we find them undesirable."
 LAKE_mage_blue_1_title: "[Root.mage_b1]"
 LAKE_mage_blue_1_desc: "Our assessment of the public’s view on magic and its practitioners has finally reached its conclusion. Sadly, the results are... less than decisive. While resentment still lingers, others believe that the barriers between mages and non-mages can be transcended, like the cultural barriers before them. Moreover, two splinter groups from both of these extremes are slowly mending fences to create a third movement that advocates caution, and a slow controlled integration of mages into society. As factions and interest groups bicker, the polarisation of our nation is taking its toll, slowly tearing it apart. From within our administration there is growing support to end the Ponderance once and for all through a gathering of intellectuals, mages, and politicians in a great debate."
 LAKE_mage_grey_2_title: "A Magical History"
 LAKE_mage_grey_2_desc: "The Arcane Ponderance has often been dominated by the rights of mages, their past crimes, and how to punish them. In short: culture and civil society. Seldom do these translate to values outside of these realms, such as the impact mages and magic would have on the economy. While of course important in their own right, redirecting parts of the discourse to matters of production, bookkeeping, transportation of goods and beyond could lead to new discoveries on how to utilise magic. After all, if we had the potential to harness the powers of magic, we could potentially increase our people’s standard of living, redirect more resources to the reclamation of the mainland, and make our market more competitive. However, the plan is not without its flaws; the first is that due to our extensive history of oppressing mages, we do not have industry standards, or knowledge on how to properly begin to integrate magic into production. The second is the potential backlash from our own people in response to their jobs being replaced by mages. By redirecting some of the yearly budget and smoothing over relations with the right people, we could have our industry go for a test run..."
 LAKE_mage_blue_2_title: "[Root.mage_b2]"
 LAKE_mage_blue_2_desc: "Our industry reports have returned, and the results are absolutely thrilling! Well... most of them are absolutely thrilling! It turns out that mages can be employed in nearly all fields, from agriculture, to steel working and mining, even aiding maritime vessels in both navigation and by granting favourable gales! Our yields could boom if we introduced mages safely into our working production lines. However... this is where the first concern introduces itself: safety. The reports have also exposed the weaknesses our nation faces from actors, individual or otherwise, who would have malintent towards us. Should the mages turn against us, their numbers will allow them to swarm us, infest every aspect of our society so that when the feeding frenzy starts they may suck us dry, paralyzed to act by the venom they shall inject  No incident occurred this time, as the Onyxguard were present during all parts of this investigation, but simply imagine the damage the mages could cause without supervision. There is also the matter of the people who would undoubtedly be replaced with such fierce competition... it would at best create a massive rearrangement in society, purchasing power of families temporarily decreasing, stagnating the entire economy, and at worst lead to open rebellions within the nation... There is much to consider."
 LAKE_mage_grey_3_title: "The Abilities of a Mage"
 LAKE_mage_grey_3_desc: "The destructive prowess of the mage is legendary among our people. Tales of their ruthlessness have been a hearthside favourite for generations, or as dark fables to scare children to bed. Though few have dared speak of it publicly, many have had the same thought: What if we used this incredible power against the centaur menace? Unleashed it to reclaim the forbidden lands? As the fervour of the Arcane Ponderance begins to rise once more, these thoughts turn to whispers, and whispers to conversations. Alas, one barrier prevents us from going further: through a combination of myth and legend, as well as in no small part due to harsh restrictions on practice and recording of the craft, we have lost the knowledge of the true destructive properties of mages and magic. Can they for instance truly summon storms? Are they really able to melt swords in the hands of soldiers? And is it true that they can possess butterflies and have them home in on their enemies before exploding? There are of course real and justified fears in arming mages and legitimising them to use their power for violent ends. However, rediscovering this potential could very well be paramount in our wars against the centaurs. Acknowledging this, we must tread with care so as to not emanate signs of approval for the mages, or stoke the fires of fear mongers."

However, they have prohibited us from using certain types of magic, namely all types of necromancy and enchantment. Furthermore, our diplomats have done their utmost to inform only the most relevant of parties, and thus ensure that no other cities will view the act as a declaration or provocation of war.

 lake.500.d:0 "The legacy of the Tyrant Queen is one so ingrained into the culture of the lakes that millenia after her death it can still be felt. Fear and cynicism towards mages is rampant, and families do everything in their power to disown their own children. These acts have, among some circles, always been controversial, ever since the uprising against the tyrants and the slaughter of the innocent. In recent times, exile has become more common than execution. Many are now sent to the Forbidden Lands, where most die at the hands of the centaurs. Some instead make their way to Narkel, which has been transformed into a massive complex built to house suspected mages and their trinkets. Within, an order of elite soldiers keep the peace: The Onyxguard. As centuries pass, the Mage Question has waned and waxed in its intensity, and yet it still haunts us even one and a half millennia after its conception."

From behind the walls of blackest stone they witnessed as the hammer descended upon the podium. Thoughts mingled at what had transpired, whispering to one another, melding into a cacophony. Through magic, anything is seemingly possible. It is a power unlike anything else, yet similar to all. It can usher in a golden age, or forge the chains of tyranny. Tricked by trinkets, we gawked at its marvels and thought any price was worth the cost. When our last monarch deposed her brother on the eve of his coronation with the mere twist of a hand, we could only pray she would use her power for good.\n\nYet her moniker betrays our fate: the Tyrant Queen. Her grip upon the realm was absolute. Those who questioned her would either die in their sleep, or wake up as fanatics praising her as a living god. Only thanks to the intervention of the other cities did the madness finally end. But as old Narkel burned, the people turned on one another, brother against sister, what was against what could be. It became a massacre. Amidst the fighting the queen disappeared. Though it was claimed she perished among the flames, her body was never recovered. Whispers rose that she had been carried off to Qarshtuluu, or drowned at sea. Alas, her final resting ground remains a mystery.\n\nBut her death did not sate the bloodlust of the coalition. The lords were hanged, and pyres lit for the mages. Innocent mingled with the guilty. They were mages from "the city of tyranny", thus they burnt. But the people did not protest. The occupation meant safety and freedom from the tyranny they had been subject to. Freedom from magic. As the coalition withdrew, they were replaced by a local militia. Clad in onyx black in memory of the spires of the old city, they now patrol our streets. As time passed this militia began instead to cooperate with mages: better the mage you know, than the mage you don’t. Through a series of protocols on the use of magic, the order could begin to monitor mages. They now operate on the understanding that so long as they act in accordance with our laws, our city is a safe haven for them. With time many have come here seeking refuge, voluntary or otherwise. But this has come at a cost, as our political enemies have lambasted us time and time again, claiming that we seek to foster yet another mage-tyrant. It is a sacrifice that we are willing to make. We can only hope that as the pondering progresses, others will come to view the world as we do."

A sickness that, if my opponents were to have their way, would engulf the entire federation in madness and chaos, as we plunge into tyranny! We, the people, would become mere pawns in their games of power, sacrificed at a whim! And for what? For what would your children be torn apart, to be harvested like animals!? For what would the graves of our ancestors be desecrated, to be made into eternal slaves!? For what would your loved ones-"\n\n"Enough! The mages of our nations, of our federation, have fought, bled, and suffered just like us! They stood with us during the incursion! Their designs and marvels of creation have saved countless thousands! Just look at Yikashlay! A fortress city shaped by the hands of magic! You speak of their tyranny, but what of their deeds of good? Will you praise them? Or are they to pay reparations for crimes they never committed?"\n\n"Calm chancellor, the rage pounded against magic is, in part, justified. Magic is power, and any power can lead to corruption of the mind. I hope you know that just as well as I do? Should magic return to our lakes, it will have a significant influence over the lives of all, mages or not. For magic is like politics: power for the privileged few. For our federation to continue, for it to grow, and for it to move forward, magic ought not to lead but follow. Through proper oversight, we will build trust. Through that trust, we will form a real bond of compassion with the people of the federation. And through that bond, we will finally earn forgiveness. I understand what I am sentencing myself, and my kin to. But to guarantee peace, to guarantee hope, and unity, this must be done. It is a sacrifice I think we all should be willing to make!"\n\nOur years of gathering information, and assessing the situation has not been in vain.

Next to your hand lies the podium hammer; you grab hold of it, and see yourself captain a mighty ship, part of the treasure fleet. Your grip at the helm is firm, but it need not be, as you are advancing safely through a mighty storm, shielded from the waves and driven forth by the might of tamed winds. You feel safe, as the crackling of lightning outside the protective barrier reveals two armed guards surrounding the collared mage.\n\nWith a slam you hear the doors of the hall shut tight. Everyone is now present. Many will return home disappointed or angry at the verdict you will announce, but some might just throw a party in celebration. You see a massive feast. Mages hurl great works of fire into the air, which explode into a spray of colour. Children push and crawl their way to the front. One of them reaches out to the mage, and the mage responds in turn. As they touch, you are overwhelmed by an agonising scream, as the child begins to rot and gaping wounds tear through the skin like knife through butter. From them, gases pour out, covering nearby bystanders. You hear them cry out in pain, their bones twisting and turning, before erupting from their flesh. They are transformed beyond recognition.

It is a conundrum like no other, to ensure that they do not rise to be above, we must keep the below. It is a violent force, one which will happily rip and tear through anything that stands in its way. Reduce cities to rubble, and its people to ash. Magic is power incarnate, made to be subjugated, and obey the whims of the wielder. But a weak mind will be overwhelmed. Even with pure intentions, doubt may cause far more harm than good. With a mind that is both willing and able to control the arcane, it is not unlikely that they will seek greater control over their brethren. Make us kneel, like their magic. This must never come to pass. Magic must never be allowed in our lands."

Not seldom throughout our history has a mage been outed because they march through our streets with an army determined to conquer, but because they have been found in their hidden laboratories, having met their own gruesome demise. Whether it be by enslaving the dead to toil the fields, only to lose control and be consumed, or by fueling the hearth by the fire of breath, only to reduce their dwelling to smouldering cinders. They are a threat to themselves, and others. Why then, would we ever trust the mage to intentionally unleash such powers? To intentionally cause harm, if they can barely control it when it is used for good? What is there to stop the crackling thunder from pulsing through our own lines? Magic is a vile thing. No one can claim to fully understand it. Children are taught to not play with the fire, and in the face of the arcane, we are children.

In recognising this we must come to terms with and redefine what magic is to us. A force that can lift countless out of poverty, and aid our workers in their woes. Is that not a force worth understanding, and taming? Are the risks not worth the rewards...? After all, even mages themselves stand to gain from this! Of course imposing limits on what can and cannot be developed goes without saying. It also stands to reason that mages should be limited in the positions they hold. One proposal is that they be disqualified from frontline military service. There is no saying if they would be able to handle the heat of battle without resorting to the arcane. After all, when defending oneself or those beloved it is only natural to give everything. By limiting mages to areas where their powers can only be used for betterment we hope to not only build trust, but build a culture around magic and its usage that promotes peaceful solutions.

By recognising both of these facts we should be able to create limitations and opportunities that give just enough leeway for magic to be practices while also ensuring the safety of all citizens. For instance, by mandating a quota of non-mages for every active mage we would be able to mitigate any issues that would arise should a mage no longer be able or willing to carry out their duties. But whereas a mage could use the arcane to plough a field or create armaments, there is no true replacement for a magical bombardment or protective wards. While a cannon might function as a substitute, it has one major flaw in comparison: mobility. When fighting an enemy as mobile as the centaurs such a factor cannot easily be ignored. In the aims of ensuring that we never create an overreliance on magic we look beyond the shortsighted gains of the perfect situation. It might lead to lower production or more casualties, but the moment that mages fail us, be it of their own volition or not, we are as a society still able to function instead of risking total collapse."

As such it is important to not provoke the populace too much, and there is no better method of provocation than hitting someone in their pockets. Thus we ought to stay clear of any financial matters so as to not draw the ire of non-mages. Meanwhile we could play up the achievements on the battlefield to further pass legislation protecting mages within the armed forces. Of course soldiers who are saved by the actions of a mage will be far more likely to speak highly of them at home.

In addition, any mage who may derive their heritage to one or more mages who have successfully taken their trials will have theirs lessened until three generations of mages have completed them. Of course those who commit crimes or break with our doctrine might see these transgressions transferred to their offspring as well. This is intended to have a two fold effect, one is to slowly integrate mages with time, and the second to encourage intermarriage between mages and non-mages in order to prevent mages forming secluded societies. All the trials include certain risks for the mage, but also opportunities. Reclaiming the frontier could earn them both land and glory, while trusted mages may have their trials onboard the treasure fleet.

One man, claiming to hail from one of our neighbours, seemed to almost know their every move. Thrice they played, thrice our generals had defeat thrusted upon them. With a hushed voice, he revealed that it was due to his knowledge of the arcane that he was able to so easily dispose of their armies. If true, it would explain his exceptional skills.

Our history is stained with the blood of our own kin. Though many are willing to lay the past behind them, those who but yesterday walked with their heads held low might not. At times, rapid change is necessary, yes, but to forcefully expedite the process of healing beyond reason, or to halt it all together, is madness. Mages are powerful, and ought to be respected. They have the power both to elevate the Federation to new heights and to plunge it into obscurity. Alas, it is not just mages who possess such powers, but politicians as well. So it seems that in our pursuit to preserve the Federation, we are once again forced to fight our own brothers and sisters, all because of a few stubborn fools."

These are vile and callous whelps whose power is derived not from merit, but from sheer luck. [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] seems to have forgotten this virtue of the Federation.

The ability to control, to force your will upon others, to choose for them, is something that many find tempting. Once a person gets a taste, it spreads like a disease, and corrupts the mind. Unable to let go, they endlessly hunger for more. But the republics of the Federation were built on the foundation that it is the people who should wield such power. For millennia, we have fought against this corruption, against tyrants, lords, and mages. Even still, there exists a force stronger than raw power, one that we have failed to control, one that we could not save our own people from: time. With time, they say, wounds are healed. Alas, this is not true. With time, the wounds are merely forgotten. As our senses become dulled to the pain, we endure, and push forwards. The scar remains, and it would be a folly like no other to walk into the embrace of the abuser, asking to have our suffering be inflected upon us yet again. We cannot control time. But we can ensure that the abuser, the mage, does not remain. With time, this ‘Ponderance’ is likely to resurface. Hopefully, we shall have the wisdom and the means at our disposal to once again quell the thirst for power, this symbol of tyranny itself.

On the other hand, the rising classes of merchants and skilled artisans often see the government as primarily existing to secure the flow of commerce and ensure the efficient flow of trade. Newer, more radical groups believe that the government should take a more active role in managing industry and employing citizens in the production of goods. Which view do we favor?"

 lake.30.c:0 "The state exists to secure commerce."

Some advisors have proposed the propagation of a nationwide military spirit, in which each person sees themselves as part of the Federation's larger efforts to protect its borders and expand beyond them. Others suggest that we ought to be a nation of artisans and crafters, people who aspire toward excellency in their work. The wealthiest of our counselors propose that our citizens see themselves as merchants, trying to make good deals and earn glory through profit. We must choose one of these paths."

One of our merchants has proposed an extremely unorthodox solution to this problem, though it may also be semi-accurately be called completely insane.

Centuries of trade brew centuries of stories, and no two maps can agree upon what the continent actually looks like.

Our harbourmasters, merchants, and others are suddenly beginning to find themselves strained as the sheer amount of goods being bought and sold, and brought into and out of the federation, has become far too much to monitor. Some claim their wares are taxed twice by the same institution, while others allege that illicit and banned goods are able to freely enter our markets and be sold in broad daylight... accusations we cannot deny.

It is time we reclaim these ports and ensure that the federation is able to sustain its own and the rest of the world’s growth.

We now know that the trail leads to a land with cities of great wealth and wonder, and that their historians speak of a mighty man, a slayer of beasts, who forced the centaurs out of their lands - presumably into our own. The forward base to this land of adventure and discovery, misery and strife, advancements and riches, is rapidly on the rise. Some call it "the little Zurkanrek" for its great importance of trade the city has in the region, where the merchant caravans gather before heading out. Others know it by a different name, "Länsivalo", the western light, the city of the aurora trail."

 J33_the_reclamation_army_desc:0 "Once, the territories of the triunics spanned all across the plains - before they became forbidden. From the Yyl Möitsa in the west, to the floodlands of the Serpent Gift in the south, to the forests of the Moduk tribes in the east: All were ours. The sudden stampede of the centaur menace ended our reign. It is high time that our rightful birthright be reclaimed. Citizens of Kalsyto Kasuk! Your country needs you."
 J33_our_lost_brethren_title:0 "Our Lost Brethren"
 J33_our_lost_brethren_desc:0 "The Wars of the Charging Hoof did more than drive us to the lakes. They broke walls, split skulls, and put cities ablaze. They broke bonds, split families, and set a fire of pure hatred ablaze. But they underestimated us. We forged new bonds, fueled by rage we drove the centaurs from the plains, and now? Now it is time to reconnect with those brave enough - or unfortunate enough - who failed to reach the safety of the lake cities. Today we mourn. Tomorrow? We rebuild."

 J33_the_source_of_the_egoirlust_desc:0 "The southern plain is an inhospitable place. The ocean winds do not travel there, making rainfall a rare occurrence. Yet life still thrives there, all thanks to the Serpent Gift. From the gift, a river, the Egoirlust, allows travel south, as refilling water and food becomes a possibility. The importance of this river cannot be understated, both economically and culturally. It must be secured."
 J33_never_again_title:0 "Never Again"
 J33_never_again_desc:0 "The plains and the lakes are a land of endless bounty - rolling plains and grasslands, its waters brim with fish, and its mighty forests house game and the finest of trees. It is a land to be desired, to be envied. The Khamgunai and the Zabatlari both came here as conquerors. Ever since, it has been the birthright of every triunic to reap the benefits of the land they proudly call home. But the centaur stampede halted that dream. Our ancestors stood no chance, and were forced into exile, weak, and alone. No longer. The centaurs have been driven back, the gates to the plains have been secured - and with the might of our fortresses, closed. Never again shall the triunics fear for their lives, never again shall we be forced to cower and hide."
 J33_those_who_stayed_behind_title:0 "Those Who Stayed Behind"
 J33_those_who_stayed_behind_desc:0 ""For many centuries the treasure fleet has sailed from our port in Zurkanrek to the then distant and mysterious lands of Haless to sell and trade goods. As is only natural, people began to move along with the fleet - there is safety in numbers. But the reverse is also true, and some stayed in the foreign land, settling down either with, or creating new families there. But they never forgot about us, about their true homeland. Now they can once again see us on the horizon, approaching them. Not as an armada of traders, but as a legion of hope. It is time to ask our brethren to come and march with us once more, and join in our unity."

 J33_a_changing_relationship_desc:0 "The relationship between us and our brethren in Beikdugang is growing closer by the day. Thanks to the sacrifices of our valiant soldiers, the city is not an exclave in a distant land, but an interconnected part. Not once do our citizens need to leave federation territory should they wish to travel there. For each passing moment, they prove their worth. Be it in military drills, or economic integration. It is under these circumstances we find ourselves in when an envoy arrives in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The process has been long, and the journey even longer. But now comes a time of celebration, for a moment of the highest of importance - the very way we consider our relationship to our Halessi brethren - will become redefined. The march of federation unity goes ever onward."

Our heartland is secured and will never again know fear. All our disperate brethren - at times long lost to us - reside under one flag - one way or another. Others too have joined us in our cause. The night sky is no longer dark, for a beacon of hope lights its path. We will overcome all hardships, no matter what. We shall become the centre of progress, and the bringers of unity to all Haless. Citizen, we thank you for your contribution."

Will you let them? They seek to burn our homes, enslave your sons, your daughters, and feast upon what remains like the savages they are. Will you let them? Our unity that we have found among one another, they seek to shatter and spread to the wind. Will you let them? Or will you rise up, and defend your rights, your brethren, your nation? None of us can stop them alone - but we are alone no longer! So come with me brethren, and we shall halt their charge in its tracks, and deny them their feast!"
 J33_centralised_conscription_title:0 "Centralised Conscription"
 J33_centralised_conscription_desc:0 "The federation and its predecessors have not been very authoritarian since the days of the witch-queen. Fearing the power that a single individual could hold, centralised power has long been frowned upon. But times change, and we must let old scars heal, lest they fester. No longer can we rely on volunteers who feel a sense of duty to the state. Instead we will create a system of conscription, where every man and every woman must serve for three years in the armed forces. This will significantly increase the amount of people we are able to call upon during times of need, and will prepare the populace to protect themselves and their rights should any foe, be they beast or tyrant, wish to undo what makes us, us."

But one idea has begun to circulate so much that this norm might just break - or at least have an exception.\n\n"The strong rule."\n\nThe centaurs rule by some manner of meritocracy where their leaders are chosen not by blood but by their capability on the battlefield. Being outdone by brutes has enraged many in the federation, enough that plans for a new bureau to find and promote skilled individuals to be opened has garnered a lot of support from not just the lower ranks, but the elite as well. Truly there is no better force of change than anger."

 J33_the_beautiful_forests_desc:0 "It is no secret that Triunic society has long been isolated from other civilised peoples. Few have ever shaped the Triunics or our way of life - beast and geography alike have seen to it. But for every fact, there is an exception. We call them "the people of the Moduk".\n\nVast and difficult to traverse, the lands of the Moduk lack any centralised authority. Instead, each tribe is governed completely independently of one another, with their own chieftains and laws. The method of determining the chieftain, too, whether through election or inheritance, varies from tribe to tribe. They are a disparate people, fighting either side by side, or brother against brother - a land much like our own.\n\nBut no matter who came to control the natural harbour where the treasure fleet would restock their supplies for the great journey ahead, the Moduk have always approached us with great respect - and in turn, we have shown the same. It is after all, thanks to the Moduk that we are able to reach Haless. It is thanks to them, to their kindness and courage, that we are not alone.\n\nThrough our conquests, we have united the woodlands - the spirits here differ from those back home, they are far stronger. The land has not been tainted and scarred by Centaur filth, or by the might of industry. Instead the land expresses its untamed manners through serenity. Now the federation faces a new issue, the first of its kind: who are the Moduk to us?"
 J33_the_vast_plains_title:0 "...The Vast Plains..."
 J33_the_vast_plains_desc:0 "South of the Moduk forests lies the first taste of Haless - a land that reminds many of home: vast plains encased by hills and the spine, with the ocean breeze rolling in. Back home, the centaurs infested our lands and dominated until the Orachav drove them back; here, the people ride giant birds of prey in a constant battle against the spirits who plague the land. But more than that, the rünsukhi await the day that civilization will return to the desert, and persist in their homes against their hardships. The shuvüüsh meanwhile fled for their lives, becoming three separate peoples as they followed three brothers. Ghastly familiar. But more than that, both peoples share some similarities with us not found elsewhere in Haless - at times not even in Beikdugang. Clothing, words, and dances. There are similarities here that make it undeniable that we have a link - a bond. They too have recognized this, and many in their numbers are beginning to see themselves as part of the federation. It is time we welcome these long-lost cousins home."
 J33_the_rolling_hills_title:0 "...The Rolling Hills"
 J33_the_rolling_hills_desc:0 "The isolated kingdoms (and later kingdom) of Daengun have long been a nemesis of ours. As the treasure fleet ventured to Haless, they would always seek to... "visit" the island of Somyonghon, where wonders of a bygone era may be found aplenty. But even as our victorious armies march into their cities, they once again resist us. They seek to remain isolated, and refuse to accept the values of the federation and its unity. Their shamans have allegedly communicated with the dead and are now spreading baseless rumours that great visions have been revealed to them, that we seek to upend their way of life and erase their identity. Lies and deception, for their own greed, that is that their resistance is. But fear not, we shall turn them into good, loyal citizens, who will come to love the federation."

Outside the arena, this man is one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s trusted vassals, but today there is only the deadly contest of two warriors. \n\n"Better make a good show of it, my Caehn!" the Ordsikar says, emphasizing those last two words mockingly. "If I kill you here, I might be elected in your place!" [Root.Monarch.GetName] cannot tell whether he's joking or seriously considering the prospect. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] laughs nonetheless, projecting confidence, and replies "You won't find it easy." The sun is scorching hot. The match begins.\n\nThe crowd roars louder than [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ever heard before. This is not just a match for Irdaeos, but for the nation: victory proves [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fundamental worthiness as a leader. But the Ordisikar is a tremendous opponent, executing a perfect charge that both gives him the advantage and displays his skill to all. [Root.Monarch.GetName] matches him blow for blow, exchanging charges and dodging arrows, sometimes coming so close [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] swears [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can hear his breath over the pounding of hooves.\n\nAs the Ordsikar's face twists in hideous concentration, [Root.Monarch.GetName] wonders if he really is aiming to be Caehn.

 centaur_tournament.4.dbd:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] ambles into the arena, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sees a vaguely familiar face. This man is a brave from a minor clan, who distinguished himself with outstanding skill in recent wars. Many say he could make Clan Head and lead his clan to greatness... but he is young still, and must prove himself. The warrior bows to [Root.Monarch.GetName] respectfully, but the look in his eyes is like starved iron. The match begins. \n\nThe young brave adopts a novel tactic, moving in zig-zag patterns rather than the traditional charge-shot-retreat. [Root.Monarch.GetName] struggles to predict him, and cannot match his practiced speed. But the tactic makes his aim inaccurate, as he never faces [Root.Monarch.GetName] head-on. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHeCap] presses this advantage by loosing shot after shot, trying to bury the youth beneath a hail of arrows. As [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind blurs in the haze of combat, the opponent almost seems a dancer, an artist on the bloody ground. \n\nBut the dance must end when an arrow finds purchase, and…"

[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] opponent today is not only an Ordsikar, but a shaman. Looking at his mix of religious garb and ornate armor, [Root.Monarch.GetName] recalls an old centaur proverb: "The one who can bless his own arrows, and then goes out to shoot them, will reach Ik Magthaal a thousand times over." The match begins. \n\nThe shaman-Ordsikar moves with unnatural calm, as if he's jogging by the river rather than charging in battle. His voice carries above the wind, singing songs of praise to Irdaos. It's everything [Root.Monarch.GetName] can do to keep [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] concentration. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHeCap] looses each shot with utmost precision, nearly pinning the shaman to the ground. In turn, he proves his deadly aim by tearing through [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s clothes.

[Root.Monarch.GetName] thrusts [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear forward with incredible force, aiming to pierce [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] opponent's defenses. The scarred clansman skillfully parries the attack, deftly sidestepping to evade the deadly point of the spear. The clang of metal against metal echoes through the arena as both warriors clash in a flurry of thrusts and strikes. \n\nThe devotee of Irdaeos counters with a lightning-quick jab, aiming for [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s heart. But the Caehn's reflexes serve [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] well as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] twists [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body, narrowly avoiding the deadly strike. The fight rages on, a symphony of spear strikes and evasions. \n\nEach warrior's movements are precise, their spears an extension of their will.

However, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] charges headfirst into the warrior's trap. The warrior sidesteps the charge, seizing the initiative, and skillfully breaches [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s defense. \n\nSensing victory, the warrior presses on, but a momentary overextension allows the Caehn to seize an opening.

They appear to be completely unarmed and unarmoured, instead raising their fists. Although it would be easy to simply strike them down, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is no coward, and will not show themselves to be one on this day. [Root.Monarch.GetName] in turn removes their weapons and armour, as their opponent smirks, the beating sun causing the two foes to begin to sweat as they face each other down, slowly circling each other, each simultaneously reluctant to make the first move, and thrilled by the prospect of combat. Then, without warning, [Root.Monarch.GetName] charges, fists raised, roaring, kicking up a trail of dust in a single, mighty charge. Their opponent does the same, as the crowd roars in anticipation of the coming battle.

Wielding a great halberd over two meters long, the Caehn stands proudly in the dimming light of the sun. Before him stands his opponent, a centaur renowned across the Caehnate for their skill with a bow. Although viewed as a relatively cowardly weapon compared to the melee counterparts, the bow is nonetheless a respected tool in any centaur's arsenal due to the skill required to use it. As the Caehn begins trotting toward his foe, they notch an arrow, pull back the bowstring, and fire, a single shot flying through the air, and missing the Caehn by the slightest of margins. They begin notching more and more arrows, unleashing a hail of fire, whilst the Caehn, now in a full charge, thunders towards their foe. The challenger, seeing the Caehn's uncanny ability to dodge, begins galloping across the tournament ground, loosing more and more arrows whilst the Caehn continually charges after them, not letting up for even a second.

Clad in his spiked armour, the Iomburvlait begins a slow, lumbering charge, aiming to knock [Root.Monarch.GetName] off their feet before the match even has the opportunity to properly begin. Reacting quickly, the Caehn rapidly jumps out of their way, spinning their mighty halberd into the Iomburvlait's flank, resulting in a roar of pain. Despite the pain, however, the Iomburvlait continues pushing forward, knowing that even a single of their mighty blows could bring the Caehn to their knees.

The venerable warrior charges at [Root.Monarch.GetName], lowering their spear for a single blow. The Caehn does the same, and as the two charge at each other, the young and the venerable, the new and the old, the audience seems to collectively hold their breath.

 filustkhuga_school: "Filustkhuga Sect"
 filustkhuga_school_desc: "The Filustkhuga sect of Irdaeos Worship is the most recent of the four major sects to emerge, only coming into being within the last 400 years. Followers of the Filustkhuga place a great emphasis on the concepts of vengeance, death, blood, and battle. The biggest question debated by shamans of Irdaeos worship is the question of how to honor Irdaeos' gift and give thanks to him, because those who have sufficiently honored him in life are granted entry to the paradise of Ik Magthaal. The doctrine of the shamans preaching the Filustkhuga is that the one true way to honor Irdaeos' Gift in life is to find a glorious death in battle. An honorable death in combat is considered the highest honor and practically guarantees entrance to the eternal paradise of Ik Magthaal in the afterlife. These beliefs are considered radical by followers of other sects, and the ordsiwyn that follow this sect are militaristic and belligerent."

 irdukhuga_school: "Irdukhuga Sect"
 irdukhuga_school_desc: "The Irdukhuga sect of Irdaeos Worship first emerged roughly 800 years ago during the times of prosperity that emerged from the rule of the Egoirlust Caehnate in the central plains, along the great Egoirlust River. The Irdukhuga believe that the best way to show thanks and honor Irdaeos’ Gift is to make the most out of what they have been given and to 'enjoy his gift to the fullest'. According to shamans of the Irdukhuga, taking his gift and then squandering it by filling it with conflict and hardship would be disrespecting it. Honoring Irdaeos for followers of the Irdukhuga is all about enjoying all of life’s pleasures. Being friendly, hospitable, carefree, and gregarious are qualities that are believed to be virtuous, and displaying these qualities in life is to be considered the best way to make it to Ik Magthaal."


 maslekhuga_school: "Maslekhuga Sect"
 maslekhuga_school_desc: "As the oldest of the four major sects of Irdaeos Worship, it is believed that the Maslekhuga is the sect that is most similar doctrinally to the original incarnation of the religion nearly 2000 years ago. In fact, many claim that all the other sects are simply schisms and offshoots of the Maslekhuga. Followers of the Maslekhuga believe that, as Irdaeos initially admired centaurs for their endurance and perseverance through hardships, that honoring Irdaeos and his gift involves continuing to display these qualities. Being persistent, persevering, steadfast, and having great endurance are all qualities believed to be virtuous, and showcasing these qualities is how you best honor Irdaeos’s Gift and thus gain entry to the eternal paradise of Ik Magthaal."

 malukhuga_school: "Malukhuga Sect"
 malukhuga_school_desc: "A sect originating from the aftermath of the Day of Ashen Skies, the Malukhuga is concerned with things such as omens, destiny, superstition, and magic. Placing even more of an emphasis on the role of shamans and spiritualism than in the other major sects, followers of the sect believe that the shamans are Irdaeos’ messengers on earth and have the ability to commune with him directly. if the forbidden plains are Irdaeos' first gift to centaurs, the powers of magic are a second gift from him. For the Malukhuga, partaking in religious rituals centered around his messengers and the magical power they wield is what is considered to be the most honorable and virtuous. Being wise, spiritual, and respectful of the shamanic traditions are the qualities emulated by followers of the Malukhuga."

 filust_extra_1: "Whilst preparing for the tournament and scouting out the competition, you spot a crowd gathering near the practice arena. As you and your guard get closer, you see the reason why. A warrior is taking on two others at the same time! Their entire body is covered by extensive ritual scarification, covering them in glyphs from torso to hooves. This devotee to Irdaeos quickly ends the mock fight with a series of swift dodges and parries, leaving the other two helpless against his technique. As you slowly start going back to your tent, you quickly realize that this tournament will be far from easy."
 filust_extra_2: "On your way back from a diplomatic meeting with one of the Ordsikar, you hear a thunderous voice burst out in laughter in one of the nearby gathering spots. As you walk by, you see a tall centaur with an intimidating necklace made of a mix of human and centaur ears. Evidently a veteran of many winter raids on the Lake Federation and a winner of many disputes, you make a note to yourself that he will probably not be an easy opponent to face in the upcoming tournament."
 filust_extra_3: "The day of the tournament has finally arrived. Everyone gathers close to the arena in anticipation of what is to come. You give the signal, and the tall bonfires around the arena are lit.  The arena itself is soon also  encased within a great ring of fire. Through the sounds of massive cheering and ritualistic throat singing, you hear a shaman beginning to chant a ritual to Irdaeos. A few clansmen slowly start moving in circles around the shaman, until the tempo of his singing increases, and the movement changes to running, and then a stampede. With dust swirling all around, fire and voice piercing the sky, it is time for the tournament to begin!"

 irdaeos_worship.3.t:0 "Festival: Feast!"
 irdaeos_worship.3.d:0 " In all the wide lands that centaurs call home, centaur communities are not usually known for their villages. Indeed, many shamans believe that the process of sedentarization involved with urbanization is an insult to Irdaeos. It is strange, then, to find such a bustling centaur metropolis in  [Capital.GetName]. It's not a city of sturdy buildings and stone roads, of course, but of fragile, hastily assembled tents. A few days ago this city did not exist, and in a week's time it will be gone. For now, though, this labyrinth of tents might be the most hectic and vibrant festival on the continent. Outside his tent, a scarred, elderly warrior tells stories of battle and heroism, while children listen with a mix of horror and wonder. Elsewhere around a bright bonfire a dozen drunken centaurs erupt in laughter at a poorly told joke that would make any sober man roll their eyes. And everywhere, no matter where you go, is the inescapable thunder of a thousand centaurs moving at once, as people gallop to find their friends, grab another drink, or simply for the sake of running. In the center of this hurricane of festivities is the Caehn’s Hill, with your tent at the top and with a full view of the camp.\n\n"The [Root.GetTitle] approaches! Quiet! Calm!"\n\nFestival bacchants, scattered around multiple clan fires and tents, cluster along the central thoroughfare as you trot in procession to your clan's pavilion. Young children peer past their parents curiously, elders from allied clans nod approvingly over the festival's grandeur, and antsy centaurs eye the chilled drink and sizzling food with yawning appetites. You straighten up mid-step, your heart swelling with pride at how your people will feast well. \n\nYou center yourself at the tent threshold in full view of all inside and out. Matriarchs and patriarchs, each a pillar of your clan, wait over wool cushions with great pageant. A feast fit for twice as many present adorns the room's shallow tables, the furniture ideally sized for a resting centaur. A straggling cough, a nervous tail whish, a flustered servant fumbling a pitcher; all hush as you step inside, the lush carpet muffling your hooves.

You gesture to the food, resuming your call to festivity.\n\n"With great honor, I grant Irdaeos' boons to all assembled. Just as in the days of our forerunners, so too today, and to the fields of Ik Magthaal."\n\nA horn accompanies your speeches conclusion, and like a herd's charge, a cheer ripples to all in attendance. As the music flares, centaurs leap to their stores and feasts, tucking into seats or laying around their communal bonfires. Before dawn, the party eats its weight in morsel and drink."

Festival-goers gather around their clan tents and bonfires, enjoying reunions and sharing news. At the appointed hour, clan musicians or supporting shamans call their groups to attention; in an instant, the grounds silence.\n\nA breeze billows by, flaring up the crackling fires and fluttering the canvas flaps: a sign of favor from Irdaeos.\n\nWithout direction, the musicians set the mood for their respective clans: solemn dirges, jolly allegros, and every manner of emotional piece with no two camps the same. The first notes play as centaurs step forward with their songs: A courageous lover avows her affection to a clanmate, a strange exile recounts his tribulations and hopeful acceptance into the clan by ceremony's end, and a grieving couple laments their child's sudden departure to disease.\n\nThe solo verses give way to a joyous call as the music realigns to the clan's past victories, hopes, and fears for the morrow. Folk dances, passed down along family and clan alike, break out as centaurs bound to the music, arm in arm and hand in hand.\n\n[i]Thump. Thump. Clap.

There was initially an attempt at order, splitting the market into quadrants, but as you gallop down from the hill and through the grand market you can see that this orderly system has completely disintegrated. To your left, a bowmaker is watching carefully as potential customers test his wares in a makeshift archery range. Right next to him a woman has set up a tent covered in striking, beautiful clothes, and is haggling over prices with a young buyer. Across from them is a skilled chef, who reveals a savory, expertly cooked steak that even from a distance makes your mouth water. Seeing the caehn, the merchants promptly abandon their customers and swarm you, all asking you to take a look at their finest goods, which can be yours for just a small fee. The bowmaker thrusts an oak bow with golden lining, which even at a glance you recognize as a masterwork. That glance is all you get before a gorgeous silk robe, specialized for centaur physiology, is thrown around you. You are barely able to register its comfort before a sizzling, tantalizing steak is right beneath your nose. An advisor whispers into your ear that perhaps it would be best to leave, pointing at the annoyed customers who are being ignored while you are pampered with offers. Mustering all of your willpower, you return the goods to their owners and trot back up the Caehn’s Hill."

While some might expect the chaotic and alcohol-fueled chanting of last night, the reality is exactly the opposite. A calm, slow melody guides the smoke and ash from the great bonfire to the sky, forming an enormous pillar of smoke and ash that drifts thousands of feet into the air. As you look upward you can see the smaller smoke plumes of the other clans in attendance, each magnificent in their own way, but none daring to outperform the great bonfire of the caehn. The crackling of the bonfire brings your thoughts back to Halann. You know that some of the festival’s less pious members are planning their trips back to their own lands, and the logistics of packing up, but you push these thoughts out of your mind, and give thanks to Irdaeos. Thanks for granting his open and wind-swept domain to centaurkind, thanks for granting success in your many long and difficult campaigns, and thanks for a large, wealthy, and prosperous clan. You stand in silent contemplation for hours, with only the roaring blaze and calming hymns as company, until the screeching cry of a hawk splits the silence. The melody comes to an instant halt, and all eyes are on the hawk as it dives towards an empty wagon, laden with valuables. The hawk swoops in, past the heavy bars of shining silver, past the intricately carved greatsword, past some of the finest silk in the Forbidden Plains, and onto a slab of salted meat. As the bird tears into the jerky, all present bow their heads in respect, and it is clear that Irdaeos is satisfied with our thanks. The camp will disintegrate over the next few days, as more and more leave the festival and the great bonfires burn themselves out. Even after the last ordsikar leave for home, no one will consider returning to claim the wagon or its loot. "

A dust cloud, kicked up by clusters of hooves, obscures a band of approaching figures. You stop, legs set into the earth with newfound strength.

Several centaurs, men and women both, set their minds on the challenges ahead, trying to ignore the odor of sweat and dust that thickens in the air. Assorted iron weights, chiseled boulders, logs as long as four centaurs, and hempen rope tethers litter the space, each ready to mark and measure. Shamans initiate their calls to challenge, cradling vases that slosh with fine oils.

Where a simple grip fails, you let your broad shoulders or broader back take the load, and when you cannot lift, you drag with rope tethers, straining with every ounce of might as your trail plows the earth. Over the hours, centaurs buckle and falter, but before long, the winners stand tall above the rest.

What mockery it must be to claim Irdaeos's blessing for what your forebears endured, you realize. After discussing with friends and shamans, they recommend a simple yet precarious show of worthiness: the Survival Rite.\n\nYou slake your thirst with a cup of bitter roots diluted in milk: a final blessing provided by your clan before you set out. Your chest swells and contracts, the concoction fortifying your body against the elements. Before clan and sky, you strip your [Root.GetTitle]'s regalia, set aside your weaponry, and disrobe save for the barest linen. Your warriors, shamans, and loved ones bow and pray for your success, but by tradition offer only advice or consolation for the trial ahead. With nothing save the clothes on your back, a horn blows to signal your hermitage. You charge headlong into the wilderness.\n\nAfter hours of rough riding, you slow to a trot and gaze at the open landscape around you. [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] sits far behind you, not even a miniscule glint in the distance. You flare your nostrils; survival now rests solely within Irdaeos' kindness and, more importantly, your own hands.

Holstering a dozen spears along your flank, you stomp your hoof onto your makeshift stone knives, ensuring their sharpness for harvesting hemp and skin alike. In the day's light, you catch a fine cow, shape another vase to store fresh water, and perfect a knotted rope for stringing up drying furs. At every hour, you keep a balance of vigilance, swiftness, caution, and daring.\n\nAs [Root.GetTitle], you sometimes forgot the monumental effort needed to sustain [Root.GetName]: how water source had to be tested for purity, how erratically the cattle wandered, or even how food could spoil if not properly cured. After first-hand frustrations in all these and more, you recall the hardships and ingenuity required for [Root.GetName]'s prosperity.\n\nBy the end of the day, you set your spoils into your shallow shelter, enjoying a moment of reprieve. Irdaeos no doubt looks at your sated belly, animated spirit, and sharpened mind with pleasure. One more lonely night alone, and you rise with the sun, the wind guiding you back home.

Another note, and you mirror the maneuver, squeezing the grip and exhaling with your swing. As you follow the steps with your partner, the other pairs watch on with keen interest, marveling at their [Root.GetTitle]'s long labored talent. Keeping pace, your steady thrum of wood on wood and hoof on earth join the ceremonial pipe as a drum of combat.\n\nAfter a song's worth of choreographed poses, the shaman holds a long note as you reset your position, stave across your sternum. The preamble finished, you nod to your partner who in turn bows back. You both tense, ready for the true contest.\n\nAs the fifer resumes playing a steady flow of notes, you initiate your spar. Sliding and levering the stave's tip, you strike forward just as your partner swats your leg. With a half-hop of pain, you reply by swinging your flank wide, granting you enough momentum to drive them onto the defense. The memories fly back: how your partner laughed when excited, the way their eyebrows creased when unamused, the twitch of their hock when ready to leap: all a key insight to both defeat your foe and strengthen your friend. In turn, you think back to your own qualities: when your lip twitches when flustered by a dodging opponent, how you flex your fingers before the strike, or the way your eyes trailed with the movement of a weapon's sweep.\n\n[i]Back. Forth. Tap. Stomp. Parry. Strike.[/i]\n\nSeveral bruises later, one of you loses their weapon's grip, the shaman prolonging another fife note to denote the fight's conclusion.
