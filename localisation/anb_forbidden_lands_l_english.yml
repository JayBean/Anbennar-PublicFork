Finally, the mercantile movement argues for the instituting of federal pressgangs to ensure that our trade ships never lack for manpower. How shall the Federation punish its malcontents?"
 LAKE_the_national_army_title:0 "The Federation Army"
 LAKE_the_national_army_desc:0 "The formation of a genuine army for the Federation has proven to be an incredibly difficult task. As these efforts continue, we are now afforded the opportunity of deciding how these new military institutions should be shaped. Does the army exist to protect national honour as the Sword faction argues? Or does it exist to ensure that the needs of industry are met and integral resources continue to flow? Perhaps the role of the military is to simply protect the nations trade routes to ensure the continued flow of trade. Regardless of the merits of each stance, we must decide what role the new Federation army shall serve."
 LAKE_outward_diplomacy_title:0 "Foreign Policy"
 LAKE_outward_diplomacy_desc:0 "One of the integral roles of the Federation will be representing the interests of our people to other states. How the Federation will approach its dealing with other states must be decided. Those within the Sword are pushing for a policy of overwhelming force to preempt foreign crises. Industrialists argue that the might of the Federation's industry will awe other states and procure friendly relations. Finally, those in the mercantile class suggest that as the Federation commercial might grows, states will become economically beholden to our interests. What course shall the Federation's foreign policy follow?"
 LAKE_the_constitution_title:0 "The Constitution"
 LAKE_the_constitution_desc:0 "After many years, we have finally completed the creation of the new federal constitution. This will impact the character of the Federation for innumerable years to come. Now that the political chaos that characterized our society is finally laid to rest, we can begin to look outward and consider the various challenges assailing the Federation as one unified people!"
 
 LAKE_draft_agricultural_reform_title:0 "Farming Changes"
 LAKE_draft_agricultural_reform_desc:0 "Successive waves of migration over the centuries have led the lakes region to be densely populated. As a result food security has always been an issue of paramount importance for all of the cities. With the foundation of the Federation, this collective challenge can now be addressed through extensive agricultural reforms. Let us draft a proposal!"
 LAKE_educate_the_farmer_title:0 "Educate the Farmers"
 LAKE_educate_the_farmer_desc:0 "Our proposed reforms of agriculture in the lakes region hinge upon the proper education of the farmers. Their current practices are short-sighted and seriously contribute to land degradation, which further exacerbates our food insecurity. We must push through sweeping changes to right this!"
 LAKE_agricultural_reform_title:0 "[Root.agricultural_reform]"
 LAKE_agricultural_reform_desc:0 "After years of drafting proposals and seeing through their implementation, our proposed overhaul of agricultural is complete. Farmers have begun to implement advances in agricultural techniques to greatly improve their crop yields without harming the land."
 LAKE_preservation_act_title:0 "[Root.preservation_act]"
 LAKE_preservation_act_desc:0 "The major impetus behind the sweeping agricultural reforms was to address food security challenges. In order to further address this challenge, the Preservation Act has been proposed that would see the adoption of a program for the purchasing of salt stores by the state to allow for widespread preserving in times of difficulty."
 LAKE_one_island_title:0 "One Island"

 LAKE_same_heart_title:0 "Same Heart"

 LAKE_accept_our_brother_title:0 "Accept our Brother"
 LAKE_accept_our_brother_desc:0 "Division promotes weakness. This is the sentiment that led to the founding of the Lake Federation, and it is still true today. Embracing our brothers can do  only good, as our traders and mothers of soldiers can attest."
 LAKE_organize_exhibition_title:0 "Organize Exhibition"
 LAKE_organize_exhibition_desc:0 "Perhaps the best way to unite the Federation is to emphasize how great we are. We should organize a grand fair, which will showcase the exceptionalism of the Federation, where men can make whatever they dream of."
 LAKE_a_lawful_federation_title:0 "A Lawful Federation"
 LAKE_a_lawful_federation_desc:0 "If the Federation is to survive, all of its members must respect all of its laws. This extends to War Rights, which many of the more radical unifiers within our country which to see revoked. We must assure the rest of the Federation that we respect their War Rights, and thus the Federation as a whole."
 LAKE_law_and_order_title:0 "Law and Order"
 LAKE_law_and_order_desc:0 "With the success of the various economic reforms, there have been calls for the implementation of a common legal system in order to adjudicate disputes between members and ensure the fair treatment of citizens of the Federation regardless of their origins. We should begin drafting a new civil code to present to the Federation's members."
 LAKE_make_our_demands_title:0 "Make our Demands"
 LAKE_make_our_demands_desc:0 "Knowing the importance that the new Federal civil code will play, other members' delegations are also working on their own proposals. This isn't a cause for concern as our proposed code is abjectly superior, and we will make the Federation's members see that one way or the other."
 LAKE_the_lake_judiciary_system_title:0 "[Root.the_judiciary_system]"
 LAKE_the_lake_judiciary_system_desc:0 "For years the delegates have debated the merits and flaws of the various proposed codes. At long last, ours has been selected! It is now up to the Federation's members to decide whether they wish to adopt the new proposed civil code, or to adhere to their existing legal codes."
 LAKE_a_federation_of_peoples_title:0 "A Federation of People"
 LAKE_a_federation_of_peoples_desc:0 "Over the last few decades significant reforms have been taking place within the Federation. With the establishment of a federal judiciary system, alongside the Federal Linguistic Academy we have taken vital steps towards further political union between the Federation's members. Moreover, with the passing of much needed landholding reforms the people are firmly behind the Federation as they know it governs for their benefit rather then the benefit of the select few. Ours is truly a federation of the people, and for the people!"
 LAKE_city_artisanat_title:0 "Cities Artisinat"
 LAKE_city_artisanat_desc:0 "That the Federation is driven by the cities is a certain fact. The urban nature of our people coupled with the economic clout the cities carry makes this an even more stark reality. As part of our continued efforts to support the cities and their residents, we have decided to provide the resources required to set up state workshops and factories to continue the economic growth of the Federation's cities!"
 LAKE_federation_artisan_title:0 "[Root.federation_artisan]"
 LAKE_federation_artisan_desc:0 "As the cities continue to grow and economic output continues to rise, the emergence of a genuine middle class has begun. This newly emergent class seems to have an insatiable desire for manufactured goods.

 LAKE_a_federation_at_our_image_title:0 "A Federation in Our Image"
 LAKE_a_federation_at_our_image_desc:0 "As the leader of the Federation the great task of drafting a formal constitution binding the Federation together falls upon us. Our decisions in the coming years will have a great impact upon every aspect of the Federation, it shall be truly cast in our image. Let us begin this work with this great duty in mind!"
 LAKE_place_of_the_banks_title:0 "Role of the State"
 LAKE_place_of_the_banks_desc:0 "Having settled the issue of the fundamental characteristics of citizenship, attention must be turned to the second article of the constitution; the role of the state. The more traditional view holds that the role of the state is to provide security for its citizens and borders, and to protect against whatever threats might emerge be they external or domestic. Alternatively, radical elements within the Federation argue that the state should be focused on shaping and directing the nature of economic life. Finally, the members of the newly emergent and highly influential mercantile class argue that the state should be concerned with ensuring the safe and efficient flow of trade. It is time to decide what the role of the state shall be."
 LAKE_the_guilds_title:0 "The Guilds"
 LAKE_the_guilds_desc:0 "As the constitution begins to take shape, the issue of guilds has come to the forefront. Guilds have long been an integral cornerstone of economic life within the Lakes, and this has not changed with the creation of the Federation. Given the vital nature of guilds as an economic institutution, we must decide what services they will be required to provide for the Federation. Elements within the military suggest that military procurement should be given highly preferential treatment to preclude any supply problems. Industrial interests put forth the very sensible point that the guilds exist to train future generations of artisans, and this should continue to be the case. Finally, the moneyed interests are arguing that commerce is increasingly the source of major economic growth, and so their interests should be privileged."
 LAKE_role_of_the_navy_title:0 "The Settling of Disputes"
 LAKE_role_of_the_navy_desc:0 "An area of vital importance that has not yet been discussed is how private disputes shall be settled. That citizens will come into conflict and require arbitration is a given, but the nature of this arbitration is up for discussion. Certain elements within the Swords argue that the time-honoured tradition of duels will suffice to resolve interpersonal conflicts. Industrialists are pushing for an increased role of guild arbitration. Finally, the mercantile class is arguing for a greater role for the Federal judiciary in dispute resolution. What stance shall we decide for the Federation?"
 LAKE_fate_of_the_conquered_title:0 "Fate of the Conquered"
 LAKE_fate_of_the_conquered_desc:0 "As the Federation reaches new heights, we begin to look outwards. What we see are many lands and many people, all of whom would do better under our administration. But given that our largest conquests undoubtedly lay ahead, already there are arguments over how to integrate any new subjects into our domain. We must decide on a path, knowing it may determine how we treat thousands, if not millions, of new citizens."
 
 LAKE_federation_diplomatic_corps_title:0 "Diplomatic Corp"
 LAKE_federation_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "The Federation is still young and fragile, if is to have any hope of long-lasting longevity we must find ways to improve relations between its  disparate members. One such proposal would be the formation of a Federation Diplomatic Corps that would exist to smooth over tensions by facilitating closer relations between the cities."
 LAKE_the_fish_seminaries_title:0 "The Fish Seminaries"
 LAKE_the_fish_seminaries_desc:0 "For the people of the lake, no other good is as integral to daily life as fish. It acts as the cornerstone of our peoples diet, regardless of their class or standing and it provides the livelihood for untold masses. For this reason, the issue of fishing rights between the cities has long been contentious, we should begin to find some means to smooth over tensions."
 LAKE_draft_fishing_act_title:0 "Draft Fishing Act"
 LAKE_draft_fishing_act_desc:0 "After tireless discussion and compromise, we have reached an agreed upon resolution. Fishing rights will be clearly delineated both between the disparate cities of the Federation, and within the boundaries of a cities designated fishing area. Licensing and enforcement will be handled local representatives to ensure compliance. While it will take many years to implement, these measures should go a long way in preventing disputes."
 LAKE_implement_regulation_title:0 "[Root.implement_regulation]"
 LAKE_implement_regulation_desc:0 "It has taken years to see the fruitful implementation of the Fishing Act, but now we have begun to see tangible benefits. There has been a noticed increase in fish for areas that long suffered, moreover state revenues are rising thanks to the new regulations."
 LAKE_a_cordial_federation_title:0 "A Federation of People"
 LAKE_a_cordial_federation_desc:0 "With the adoption of various much needed reforms, the Federation has begun to coalesce into something resembling a cohesive unit.

 LAKE_of_art_and_poetry_title:0 "Of Art and Poetry"
 LAKE_of_art_and_poetry_desc:0 "With our overwhelming focus on diplomacy, trade, warring, something vital has been lost. We should sponsor the finest artists and poets in the land, to remind our people what they are working for."
 LAKE_the_storytellers_title:0 "The Storytellers"
 LAKE_the_storytellers_desc:0 "The legends of the Triunic people stretch back as long as any man can remember, with some dating to the time before our arrival on the Islands. We should write down these stories, so that we may always remember our past."

 LAKE_home_for_everyone_title:0 "Home for Everyone"
 LAKE_home_for_everyone_desc:0 "Just as providing food for the population has often been a challenge, so too has providing adequate housing. These challenges have been further exasperated by frequent Centaur invasions, and internal strife. As the Federation continues to evolve, there has been a concerted push to address this by embarking on widespread state led development projects. We should heed this advice and rectify the problem!"
 LAKE_finance_census_title:0 "Finance Census"
 LAKE_finance_census_desc:0 "As development continues forward, we have begun to realize how woefully inadequate our understanding of the populace is. We can't even keep track of our own people! How can we expect to know their challenges and needs if we don't even know they exist? We shall undertake a massive census in a bid to take a full and proper stock of our population."
 LAKE_every_man_a_landlord_title:0 "[Root.every_man_a_landlord]"
 LAKE_every_man_a_landlord_desc:0 "The completion of the development projects has led to urban renewal and greatly resolved the housing challenges of our people. We should take advantage of this by pushing through additional laws mandating that every man be entitled to his own home, thereby banning extortionate rental practices that have been all too common up until now."
 LAKE_further_capital_improvement_title:0 "Capital Improvement"
 LAKE_further_capital_improvement_desc:0 "The urban renewal resulting from the widespread development schemes has opened the way for further improvements of the capital.

 LAKE_a_growing_administration_title:0 "A Growing Administration"
 LAKE_a_growing_administration_desc:0 "As the Federation continues to centralize into a genuine political union, there has been a manifold increase in the complexities of the often cumbersome political machinery.

 LAKE_the_federation_needs_desc:0 "One thing continues to stand out when discussions are broached about the needs of the bureaucracy. Paper. All they care about is paper!

 LAKE_a_united_federation_title:0 "[Root.a_united_federation]"
 LAKE_a_united_federation_desc:0 "The preceding decades have seen concerted efforts at centralization reforms within the Federation both by us and other members have born great fruit. The development of vital federal institutions such as the judiciary, military and the adoption of integral economic reforms like free trade have contributed to conditions of overall euphoria as the Federation is clearly on the ascendant! Even now citizens call for even greater centralization to continue the progress of the past decades. Naturally we must acquiesce to these demands and continue to bring the various societal institutions under the sway of the Federal government!"
 LAKE_grant_navy_commissions_title:0 "Grant Navy Commissions"

 LAKE_trade_agreement_desc:0 "Even with the foundation of the Federation, the constituent members are still jealously guarding their trade through stifling tariffs and other prohibitive measures. So long as trade continues to be treated in such a zero-sum manner, tensions will continue to persist and the Federation will not prosper. We must devote our resources to finding a means to facilitate freer flow of trade within the Federation!"
 LAKE_internal_market_title:0 "Internal Market"
 LAKE_internal_market_desc:0 "Central to the proposed trade reforms is the creation of a genuine internal market for the free flow of goods within the Federation. This would be done by prohibiting tariffs between the cities and banning other protectionist measures like import quotas. While these proposals will not be popular with all of the Federation's members, it is necessary to create a more prosperous and equitable economic system."
 LAKE_free_trade_title:0 "[Root.free_trade]"

 LAKE_the_root_military_reform_desc:0 "As the leading power within the Sword faction it falls upon us to push for vital military reform within the member states! These reforms will focus upon standardizing the various fighting forces of the Federation's members to encourage cohesion and coordination.

These reforms should ensure the continued effectiveness of the Federation's military against foreign and domestic threats!"
 LAKE_sea_laws_title:0 "Sea Laws"

 LAKE_maritime_exploitation_zone_title:0 "Maritime Exploitation Zone"
 LAKE_maritime_exploitation_zone_desc:0 "The first step towards regulating the waves is reigning in the fishermen, who have no laws to follow outside of the original maritime zones claimed by the cities. We must expand these zones to areas around the mainland to prevent further conflict."

 LAKE_anti_piracy_act_desc:0 "A constant irritant to every state on the Lakes has been pirates, who are impossible to stop, as they can simply cross into another nation's territory to escape prosecution.

 LAKE_federation_observer_title:0 "Federation Observers"
 LAKE_federation_observer_desc:0 "While the Federation has now enacted a variety of policies and regulations, there is a dearth of enforcement, with no centralized system to ensure every member state is meeting its commitments.

 LAKE_colonial_office_title:0 "Colonial Office"
 LAKE_colonial_office_desc:0 "As colonization of the mainland continues unabated, the increasingly complex task of administering to the fledgling colonies is coming to a head.

 fed_politics.4.a:0 "Please do"
 fed_politics.4.b:0 "We can't afford the cost"
 
 lake.1.t:0 "The Federation Linguistic Academy"
 lake.1.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThough the peoples of the Lake Federation share a common culture, and nominally a common language as well, different regions have developed their own dialects. This has unfortunately impeded the free flow of people, information, and goods. To reduce these barriers, the Federation Linguistic Academy was founded to create a standardized, 'proper', form of the language. Certain elements of the court believe speaking the same language as our neighbors will ease our future expansion into their lands, and so they encourage us to join it. Others, however, believe in maintaining our distinctive regional character."
 lake.1.a:0 "We shall join the academy!"
 lake.1.b:0 "Absolutely not!"
 
 lake.2.t:0 "The Islanders Declaration"
 lake.2.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe idea of recognizing a single national identity for all citizens of the Federation has been a long-term goal of the unification movement for some time now. With the creation of the Islanders Declaration, a document that recognizes the people of the Island as a single, united nation divided only by politics rather than by culture, the opportunity to lend institutional legitimacy to this notion has never been better. We must decide whether we will back the pro-unification tendencies in this matter or remember our unique ancestral roots from before we came to inhabit the Island."
 lake.2.a:0 "Sign it!"
 lake.2.b:0 "We must not abandon our roots."
 
 lake.3.t:0 "Universal Clothing Distribution"
 lake.3.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe environment of the Lakes is not kind to those who are ill-prepared to face the elements. Humidity, rain, and insects all detract from the productivity of poorly-clothed laborers. While providing clothing may incur a small expense on the part of the Federation, the gains in both public morale and production should far outweigh it."
 lake.3.a:0 "So long as they know who is giving it to them..."
 
 lake.4.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agricultural Reforms"
 lake.4.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nWith the application of modern agricultural techniques, we can harness our abundant supply of fresh water to feed our people without depleting the soil."
 lake.4.a:0 "Great!"
 
 lake.5.t:0 "Preservation Act"
 lake.5.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe long-term storage of food is in the national interest, lest the State be vulnerable to the public's ire during seasons of poor harvest. By maintaining the necessary stores of salt we can begin a program of food preservation. During the next time of hardship, our foresight will doubtlessly pay off in spades."
 lake.5.a:0 "I do so love salted meats..."
 
 lake.6.t:0 "Judiciary System"
 lake.6.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nConvoluted, overlapping and redundant systems of law have led to arbitrary decisions, inequality, and a general sense of unfairness. A clearly written, universal law code will provide much-needed transparency. Of course, these convoluted systems have always given a certain edge to those in power, who are the only ones capable of navigating them. Successfully completing this reform will thus require an investment of political capital."
 lake.6.a:0 "A modern state requires modern laws"
 lake.6.b:0 "We're fine on our own"
 
 lake.7.t:0 "Artisans of the Federation"
 lake.7.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe beating heart of any advanced economy is the artisan class: those who give raw materials value by manufacturing beautiful and useful items out of them. The expanding middle class of our society has come to demand an ever-growing number of manufactured goods. With careful investment we can help our artisans meet this new demand, making them wealthier and more productive."
 lake.7.a:0 "It will make us wealthier, too."
 
 lake.8.t:0 "Federal Fishing Regulations"
 lake.8.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nSince time immemorial the people of the Lakes have lived in large part off the bounty of the sea. Unfortunately, the uneven distribution of fishermen has led to certain areas being considerably less productive. New Federation regulations hope to address this by establishing specific fishing zones for each community, which should help keep the numbers of fish in any one area more consistent and improve their numbers overall. Controlling access to these zones is also a great opportunity to raise additional revenues."
 lake.8.a:0 "Fish are okay, but I love additional revenues."
 
 lake.9.t:0 "Every Man a Landlord"
 lake.9.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nIn the past, the average citizen has had to rent their homes and lands from large, wealthy landowners. This is an unfortunate state of affairs, since it not only keeps some of our citizens in poverty, but also obligates them to private citizens. Such conflicting loyalties are archaic, as every citizen's first duty must be to the State."
 lake.9.a:0 "Oh, their adorable little cottages!"
 
 lake.10.t:0 "The Administrative Supply"
 lake.10.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nGreat shortages of a critical good have hampered the easy and efficient administration of our territories. Fortunately, new investments should help ease that difficulty."
 lake.10.a:0 "Wait, you mean paper?"
 
 lake.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] Proposes Unification"
 lake.11.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\n[From.GetName] has laid out in painstaking detail the great inefficiencies of our current system. Their delegation makes a persuasive case that the Federation's future hinges on whether we can unify as one people under one administration. They point to the need for a united front against external threats, and, of course, the potential wealth that unification could bring."
 lake.11.a:0 "A necessity."
 
 lake.12.t:0 "Free Trade Agreement"
 lake.12.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nA delegation from [From.GetName] has proposed a free trade agreement that would greatly relax the barriers impeding the free flow of goods across political boundaries. Theoretically, everyone should benefit. Of course, certain politically influential individuals may find the idea of new competition unappealing, and they could surely prove to be valuable allies if only we were to continue protecting them."
 lake.12.a:0 "Free trade will lead to cheaper goods and easier sales!"
 lake.12.b:0 "...but won't anyone think of the domestic industry?"
 
 lake.13.t:0 "The Twin Roles"
 lake.13.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThere are two types of people: those who wield weapons and those who pay for them. Both contributions are equally valid, and the time has come to choose which service we will lend to the Federation as a whole."
 lake.13.a:0 "We shall fight!"
 lake.13.b:0 "We prefer the home front."
 lake.13.c:0 "Sounds like something for other people to do."
 
 lake.14.t:0 "The Gleaming Banners"
 lake.14.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe era of petty militias and loosely disciplined militarizes is coming to an end. We now command a standing army of brave and faithful soldiers, but their patchwork armor and worn weapons are a sorry sight. Surely it is time for us to be faithful to them in turn and make sure they look the part?"
 lake.14.a:0 "Good equipment is both useful and fashionable."
 
 lake.15.t:0 "The [From.GetName] Military Reforms"
 lake.15.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\n[From.GetName], in the interest of the Federation as a whole, has developed a plan for standardizing our various fighting forces so that they might have an easier time coordinating on the battlefield. Along with these standardizations comes recommendations for new military practices which should help our military stand up against our many threats, both foreign and domestic."
 lake.15.a:0 "True power comes from soldiers' steel"
 
 lake.16.t:0 "Mainland Colonization"
 lake.16.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nOur ancestors once abandoned the mainland and fled to the islands on which we now make our homes. Recent developments have opened an opportunity for our people as a whole to begin the reclamation of their ancestral homes, but many argue that doing so is entirely unnecessary."
 lake.16.a:0 "It is our birthright!"
 lake.16.b:0 "Personally, I just adore the islands."
 
 lake.17.t:0 "Our Navy"
 lake.17.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nAs a maritime nation, our shipyards are constantly at work repairing and building new vessels, whether those be private fishing vessels or grand warships. As a result, the time and labor of experienced shipbuilders is a precious commodity, and we must choose whether to dedicate it mostly to the construction of our great merchant fleets or to the construction of military vessels."
 lake.17.a:0 "Military ships command the waves!"
 lake.17.b:0 "Commercial vessels bring prosperity."
 
 lake.18.t:0 "The Piracy Question"
 lake.18.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nPirates have been preying on our vulnerable vessels for some time now, and the situation has become untenable. Our advisors have presented us with two solutions: either we can chase them down and give them the noose, or we can pay them to go bother someone else instead."
 lake.18.a:0 "Pirates? These fine gentlemen are privateers!"
 lake.18.b:0 "These criminals will receive nothing but death!"
 
 lake.19.t:0 "The Anti-Piracy Act"
 lake.19.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nHaving long been a scourge to the innocent merchant vessels of the Federation, recent legal developments have made sponsoring piracy a high crime. Pirate hunters have been commissioned to destroy the last of their criminal hideouts, and justice will finally be served."
 lake.19.a:0 "Our choices will always have consequences..."
 
 lake.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] ask for War Rights"
 lake.20.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nA delegation from [From.GetName] came to us asking for War Rights. These would allow them to legally wage a military campaign against another member of the Federation."
 lake.20.a:0 "A shake-up is always good"
 lake.20.b:0 "And spill innocent blood? Of course not!"
 war_rights_tooltip:0 "They are allied with §G[ally1.GetName]§! §G[ally2.GetName]§! §G[ally3.GetName]§! §G[ally4.GetName]§!\nThey rivaled §R[rival1.GetName]§! §R[rival2.GetName]§! §R[rival3.GetName]§!"

 lake.21.t:0 "[From.GetName] Response"
 lake.21.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nOur delegation was well-received, and [From.GetName] has seen fit to grant us the legal recognition necessary to wage war."
 lake.21.a:0 "Great!"
 
 lake.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] Response"
 lake.22.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nOur diplomats were greatly disrespected by their reception in [From.GetName], which has denied us the legal recognition we needed to wage war. A grave insult!"
 lake.22.a:0 "A slight we will not easily forget"
 
 lake.23.t:0 "Loss of War Rights"
 lake.23.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nHaving now declared war on another member of the Federation, the War Rights we had previously received are now nullified."
 lake.23.a:0 "Understood."
 
 lake.27.t:0 "Unification of the Federation"
 lake.27.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nHaving declared their intention to unify the Federation, [From.GetName] has built their new State. They wish for us to join it, and in so doing participate in the betterment of all our people. Of course, giving up our independence is not going to go over well with some..."
 lake.27.a:0 "We move forward as one!"
 lake.27.b:0 "We will not recognize their so-called 'unification'"
 
 lake.28.t:0 "Crisis in the Federation"
 lake.28.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_crisis£\nThe squabbling of petty power brokers in the Federation, without strong central leadership, has plunged it into a terrible political crisis. The institutions of the Federation have locked up as internecine conflict drives each group to seek to deny advantages to the others."
 lake.28.a:0 "We need to get out of here!"
 
 lake.29.t:0 "End of the Crisis"
 lake.29.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_crisis£\nThe emergence of a strong new order within the Federation has allowed business to return to normal, and now that the institutional gridlock has been resolved the crisis should soon abate."
 lake.29.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 lake.39.t:0 "End of the Federation"
 lake.39.d:0 "The Federation has been disbanded!"
 lake.39.a:0 "Our darkest hour..."
 
 lake.40.t:0 "Federation Elections"
 lake.40.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\n[Root.GetName] will now lead the Federation for the next 4 years!"
 lake.40.a:0 "Our time to shine!"
 
 lake.41.t:0 "The Twin Cities of Zabyos and Tlar"
 lake.41.d:0 "As the city grows, the difference between the high and lower classes in Zabyos'tlar has become all too visible. The city has grown up and over the canal, bathing the lower districts in darkness while the Zabyos'tlaric elite thrive high above. With this divide the city has become known as two, the grand and opulent Sky Walk of Zabyos above and the filthy, darkened Undercity of Tlar below."
 lake.41.a:0 "At least I don't have to mingle with the rabble anymore."
 
 lake.42.t:0 "The Ultakal Decree"
 lake.42.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nIn the year 473 AA, prospectors from our city found gold on the island of Ultakal, however our neighbor and sister city of Tzidoilhol claimed that they were the ones to discover the bounty, and disputed our rightful claim. War was narrowly averted when the city of Haraigizenhi Bulrek convinced our cities to sign the Ultakal Decree, which states that our two cities must trade the island every 5 years. For nearly 1000 years we have abided by this decree, and have recently passed the island back to Tzidoilhol for their term of ownership."
 lake.42.dd:0 "In the year 473 AA, prospectors from our fair city found gold on the isle of Ultakal. As the sole source of the precious metal in all of the Four Lands, our neighbor and sister city of Khugatseig was overcome with greed, nearly driving our people to war until the statesmen of Haraigizenhi Bulrek managed to broker peace. Since then, our two cities have traded ownership of the island every 5 years without incident. The most recent trade has gone as normal, and we currently hold sovereignty over the Isle of Gold."
 lake.42.a:0 "Good"
 
 lake.43.t:0 "The Ultakal Decree"
 lake.43.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nIt is time for us to give back the control of Ultakal."
 lake.43.a:0 "Give them the province"
 lake.43.b:0 "Keep it, because why not?"
 
 lake.44.t:0 "Ideas Melting Pot"
 lake.44.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nTolerating cultures, even if they come from wholly different places, gives us access to a wide range of experiences"
 lake.44.a:0 "We're stronger together"
 
 lake.45.t:0 "The Wandering Band"
 lake.45.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe Wandering Band is a multicultural group of artists, coming from every part of the islands, conducting performances all over the country."
 lake.45.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 lake.46.t:0 "Wandering Band in [province.GetName]"
 lake.46.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe Island Wandering Band as arrived in [province.GetName]"
 lake.46.a:0 "Those words are a song to my ears!"
 
 lake.47.t:0 "Anti-Piracy Act"
 lake.47.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe Anti-Piracy Act was signed today in the Assembly House, mandating a unified Federation response to Pirates in the lake, and a centralized justice system for handling their prosecution and punishment. We are expected to take part, as the fractured systems were part of what allowed their menace to grow strong. But some voices still declaim the act as a violation of our sovereignty, and an overstepping of the Federation's bounds and mandate. What shall [Root.Monarch.GetName] decide?"
 lake.47.a:0 "Sign it"
 lake.47.b:0 "Don't sign it"
 
 lake.48.t:0 "The Caravan Act"
 lake.48.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe Caravan Act has been signed in the Assembly House, calling on every member of the Lake Federation to maintain a standardized network of caravan-routes in their lands, and keep them clear from bandits or other hazards. The Act should encourage trade between Federation members, and offer an alternative route to the Lakes themselves for the transport of goods and people across the land. But there are a few voices who suggest that if we were to ignore the Act, our merchants might be able to undercut those of other states, not to mention the savings in manpower if we don't need to commit to regular patrols."
 lake.48.a:0 "Sign it"
 lake.48.b:0 "Those who walk our roads shall walk alone."
 
 lake.50.t:0 "[From.GetName] call for help!"
 lake.50.d:0 "£icon_lake_federation_event£\nThe city of [From.GetName] is under attack from those filthy centaurs! As member of the Sword Faction, it is our duty to help them!"
 lake.50.a:0 "Respect the Call of Duty"
 lake.50.b:0 "We never liked them anyway"
 
 lake.51.t:0 "[From.GetName] troublemaker!"

However, strange rumours have arisen around his endeavours, that they are not simply an eccentric project but are in fact a quest towards some mysterious 'ascension'.\n\nSome argue that we should allow this brilliant man his due, and trust that there is a method to what may seem like madness to us lesser minds.

But we do know this — at 3 AM, on the 31st of Tearfall, the city he lived in... we have no better word than 'ascended'. Once busy streets went silent. Once active markets froze in time. The song of birds, the rush of water, the burble of conversation — all ceased. The entire population of the city has simply frozen, rendered static in a world constantly in motion.\n\nTheir eyes still dart to and fro, seeming to drink in the sight of their surroundings. But aside from that, they have entered some sort of stasis — not even our strongest magics seem able to effect them, let alone get a sense of what is going on. Thankfully, this only happened in the inventor's city, and we shudder to think what it may have meant had the effect reached across our entire nation.

 ##########Lake Constitution
 lake.30.t:0 "Role of the State"
 lake.30.d:0 "Perhaps the most fundamental question of statecraft is determining the proper role of government. The most ancient view is that governments exist to ensure the security of their citizens and borders from both internal and external threats. On the other hand, the rising classes of merchants and skilled artisans often see the government as primarily existing to secure the flow of commerce and ensure the efficient flow of trade. Newer, more radical groups believe that the government should take a more active role in managing industry and employing citizens in the production of goods. Which view do we favor?"
 lake.30.a:0 "The state has a monopoly on violence."
 lake.30.b:0 "The state should direct production."
 lake.30.c:0 "The state exists to secure commerce."
 
 lake.31.t:0 "The Citizen"
 lake.31.d:0 "As we develop our government, we must ask ourselves who our citizens should aspire to be. Some advisors have proposed the propagation of a nationwide military spirit, in which each person sees themselves as part of the Federation's larger efforts to protect its borders and expand beyond them. Others suggest that we ought to be a nation of artisans and crafters, people who aspire toward excellency in their work. The wealthiest of our counselors propose that our citizens see themselves as merchants, trying to make good deals and earn glory through profit. We must choose one of these paths."
 lake.31.a:0 "All our citizens have a role in national security."
 lake.31.b:0 "The work of our citizens shall be the envy of the world!"
 lake.31.c:0 "A good citizen understands the value of wealth."
 
 lake.32.t:0 "Crime and Punishment"
 lake.32.d:0 "Sadly, some elements of our society will always commit crimes. Though most crimes are small and can be handled by a small fine or temporary incarceration. The gravest of crimes can only be dealt with by death or a lifetime in a dungeon. What should we do with those in the middle, the ones who commit serious offenses but might yet redeem themselves?"
 lake.32.a:0 "Delinquents make excellent cannon fodder."
 lake.32.b:0 "They will pay their debt to society through labor."
 lake.32.c:0 "We will put them to work on our trade ships."
 
 lake.33.t:0 "The Guilds"
 lake.33.d:0 "Associations of skilled laborers, also known as guilds, will receive recognition from the government in exchange for the guild performing certain services. Which services should we demand?"

 lake.33.b:0 "They must train the next generation of workers."
 lake.33.c:0 "The Merchant's Guild will receive special treatment."
 
 lake.34.t:0 "The Federation Army"
 lake.34.d:0 "One of the challenging things about forging a new nation is the creation of an all-new set of military institutions. However, it will also give us an excellent opportunity to re-evaluate the priorities of our forces. What is the greatest purpose of the Lake Federation's army?"
 lake.34.a:0 "To defend national honor on the battlefield."

 lake.35.a:0 "Speak softly, but carry a big stick."
 lake.35.b:0 "They will be awed by the power of our industry."
 lake.35.c:0 "When their wealth depends on our merchants, they will do as we want."
 
 lake.36.t:0 "The Settling of Disputes"
 lake.36.d:0 "People will always try to defend their honor, so a stable government provides its citizens with ways to settle their disputes within the boundaries of the law. This promotes national cohesion, reduces violence, and avoids vigilante justice. How will our new state tackle this challenge?"
 lake.36.a:0 "A formal system of duels is all that is needed."
 lake.36.b:0 "Expand the system of guild arbitration."
 lake.36.c:0 "Courts may award monetary damages."
 
 lake.37.t:0 "Fate of the Conquered"
 lake.37.d:0 "Handling the fate of a newly conquered people is a difficult problem for governments. If you leave the population too well-off, they may have the resources to rebel. On the other hand, if you are too demanding of them, they may feel they must rebel anyway. What shall be our policy?"
 lake.37.a:0 "Place their communities under military supervision."

 J33_black_bullet_desc:0 "A major problem for our military formations are mages, who can shoot a fireball larger than even the largest cannonball. However, we have discovered a new materiel, one with substantial anti magic properties. Let's see how smug the mages are when they take a black bullet to the face!"
 J33_the_ends_title:0 "The Ends"
 J33_the_ends_desc:0 "A gun is useless without the man to wield it. No matter how hard this fact is to confront, we must face it, and adjust our training procedures accordingly. A skilled soldier in our military has come forward with a plan to increase fire discipline among our troops, to turn them into an army rather than a paid mob of armed men."
 J33_blue_drill_title:0 "Blue Drill"
 J33_blue_drill_desc:0 "Our troops are now the most disciplined in the world, able to blow any enemy away. They all fire together, but unlike other armies, can actually aim. They have trained with guns since childhood, and carry weapons that any enemy army will learn to fear."
 J33_the_BFC_title:0 "The BFC"
 J33_the_BFC_desc:0 "Our gunsmiths are the finest in the world, a fact they have recently proved. Working together in great secrecy, our finest craftsmen have created the largest cannon the world has ever seen, the appropriately named BFC. Its power is incredible and should be more than enough to deal with any threat, even those from beyond the mortal plane."

 J33_the_442th_desc:0 "In the many gun tournaments held across the land, a few top contenders have emerged. They are adored by the crowds, but they could serve the nation better by fighting. They will be conscripted into a new 442nd regiment, which will always be at the front of our armies, always being ready to go for broke in battle."
 J33_the_blue_star_of_honor_title:0 "Blue Star of Honor"
 J33_the_blue_star_of_honor_desc:0 "While mastery of the finest weapon on Hallana is obviously its own reward, some of our troops think otherwise. Therefore, we shall create a new decoration, the Blue Star of Honor, which shall be awarded only to finest soldiers. All shall be motivated by the chance of winning this coveted medal, showing the glorious Lone Star of our flag, marking them as exemplars of what makes our country great."
 J33_a_floating_gun_title:0 "A Floating Gun"
 J33_a_floating_gun_desc:0 "Guns, as a general rule, cannot float, and thus we have neglected our navy. However, some of our admirals have come together with a plan to make a ship, tentatively called the floating gun. It will have very little on board to minimize weight, which will allow us to make it the most heavily armed ship ever created."

 J33_refit_the_navy_desc:0 "The decrease in wars between Federation members has led to unforeseen consequences, most notably the erosion of our once-fine naval tradition. We must work to remedy this if we ever hope to take the fight to the centaurs."
 J33_creating_the_military_council_title:0 "The Military Council"
 J33_creating_the_military_council_desc:0 "If we are ever to defeat the vile centaurs, our army must be as strong as possible. Therefore, we shall assemble a council of our finest generals to constantly plan coordinate our army movements. Many have objected to this on the basis that it will permanently turn us towards war, but any sacrifices must be accepted in our quest to free the plains."
 J33_to_serve_and_protect_title:0 "To Serve and Protect"
 J33_to_serve_and_protect_desc:0 "Whenever a soldier enlists in our military, they must take a simple oath, that they must follow at all times. They must pledge to serve and protect the citizens of the lake, and they must follow this code at all times. If they ever violate the code by attacking an innocent citizen or any other offense as determined by the military council, then they are executed, as they have fallen to the level of the honor-less centaurs."
 J33_leading_by_examples_title:0 "Leading by Example"
 J33_leading_by_examples_desc:0 "While we our soldiers are incredibly courageous, their leaders are much less so. Many of them are holdovers from the old city armies, only experienced at fighting over fishing rights. We must address this immediately by forcing officers to lead from the front, which will both help us identify the bravest among them and weed out those who should never have joined the army in the first place."
 J33_strategical_readyness_title:0 "Strategical Readiness"
 J33_strategical_readyness_desc:0 "While our soldiers are well trained, there are not very many of them. If we lost even one critical battle, our army would be incredibly understrength until new men could be raised. We should establish a system of reserves across the Triunic cities to make sure that we are ready, no matter what challenges come our way."
 J33_tactical_readyness_title:0 "Tactical Readiness"
 J33_tactical_readyness_desc:0 "The major advantage that the raiders have held over us in the past is their movement speed, with them being able to flee whenever we have been able to defeat. Our troops must be specifically trained for pursuit, and our generals must know the value of speed. The horsemen will be able to run no more."
 J33_the_kukaein_title:0 "The Kukaein"
 J33_the_kukaein_desc:0 "The Lake Shall Return! This is the chant uttered across innumerable battlefields, repeated at funerals, and the final words the centaurs hear before the end of their pitiful lives. It shows the unwavering commitment of the Triunic people to destroy those who oppressed them, and to repay what was dealt to them one hundred fold. "
 J33_center_peel_unit_title:0 "Center Peel Units"
 J33_center_peel_unit_desc:0 "Even with our new focus on speed, we cannot hope to catch monsters who have hooves instead of legs. To remedy this, we will employ a new battle tactic that focuses on luring the centaurs towards the center of the army, and once they are there, the trap shall be sprung. Our flanking infantry will quickly circle around them, trapping the monsters and letting us finish them off."
 J33_reshape_the_army_title:0 "Reshape The Army"
 J33_reshape_the_army_desc:0 "The formation of the Federation has brought together many different city militaries, all with different ideas of how to run the army. To remedy this, we will appoint an overall army chief with the specific goal of promoting unity among our soldiers. They must learn to serve Sojdalasät, not their individual cities."

 J33_for_everything_title:0 "For Everything"
 J33_for_everything_desc:0 "In the past, we were content to drive the centaurs away, letting them return once they have licked their wounds. Now that we have occupied the land of the centaurs, we will make sure they can never menace us again. Only humans shall roam the plains, and the hoofbeats of centaurs shall be only a memory."
 J33_wrong_door_title:0 "Wrong Door"
 J33_wrong_door_desc:0 "For as long as they have existed, the centaurs have been a menace. Our ancestors were driven from their homelands, only surviving by hiding on an island, waiting to take their revenge. Now we are ready, and the horsemen shall pay for their crimes."
 J33_wrong_neighbourhood_title:0 "Wrong Neighborhood"
 J33_wrong_neighbourhood_desc:0 "If history has taught us anything, it is that if a single centaur lives, there will never be peace. Ever since they first raided into our Island, they have fought us nearly continually, and they will not stop until we solve the centaur Problem. Permanently."

 J33_great_urbanization_title:0 "Great Urbanization"
 J33_great_urbanization_desc:0 "Over the years, the population of the Federation has grown, but many people still work on farms much as their ancestors did. This is both a human tragedy and an economic one, for artisan goods are much more valuable than bread. A series of tax incentives to encourage movement to the cities would do much to alleviate this, as well as making our country much easier to administrate."
 J33_no_one_left_behind_title:0 "No One Left Behind"
 J33_no_one_left_behind_desc:0 "While many people of the Lakes have prospered due to trade, others work for low pay and live in squalor. They have short lifespans, many children, and form the nuclei of potential revolts. We have a moral duty to provide them with the means to live, which will also have the benefit of letting the bountiful children of the poorer classes live full, productive lives, rather than dying young."
 J33_northern_childrens_title:0 "Northern Children"
 J33_northern_childrens_desc:0 "While many of our distant brethren live in the north of the mainland, they still live much as they always have, hunting and fishing to survive. Many of the resources of the north lie unexploited, and life expectancy among these people is abysmal. We should both bring in new settlers and invest in infrastructure if we ever hope to populate the north."
 J33_the_breaking_point_title:0 "The Breaking Point"
 J33_the_breaking_point_desc:0 "With the increased focus on the mainland, we must not forget the islands from whence we came. It is the center of our population, culture and economy, and we must ensure it is not left behind. A concentrated program of tax breaks for those who have many children would do much to speed the Island's development, as well as substantial infrastructure investments."
 J33_southern_childrens_title:0 "Southern Children"
 J33_southern_childrens_desc:0 "To the south of the island lies a land of contrasts, from the high mountains to the sea, and from the deserts to the deep forests. This diversity has created many prime locations for urban centers, which have gone unexploited due to the rampaging centaurs. With them removed, we can finally begin to turn the region into the beacon of progress it was always meant to be."
 J33_reaching_new_height_title:0 "Reclaiming our Riches"
 J33_reaching_new_height_desc:0 "Our people once extended across the plains, only entering the Island once driven there by the centaurs. With our return, we can finally begin making them what they were always meant to be, the home of massive urban areas. By building cities and offering financial incentives for people to live in them, we can quickly create centers of population to rival any of those on the Lakes."
 J33_touching_the_sky_title:0 "Sky Harbours"
 J33_touching_the_sky_desc:0 "Are pots have never been busier, and they can barely handle the traffic they are receiving. One of our merchants has proposed an extremely unorthodox solution to this problem, though it may also be semi-accurately be called completely insane. It involves running suspended bridges over the ships directly on the waterfront and removing cargo from ships farther back by means of pulleys. While the physics might prove challenging, there is no challenge that the great populace of the Federation cannot defeat."
 J33_city_council_title:0 "City Council"
 J33_city_council_desc:0 "The Lake Federation has always been defined by its cities, which between them have enough diversity as all the rest of Halann combined. Now that we have united the Lake Federation, we must also unite these diverse cities in a City Council, to coordinate policy and practice. All our cities must rise together — and with them, the entire Federation shall rise."
 J33_state_council_title:0 "State Council"
 J33_state_council_desc:0 "We have had great success in organizing the Council of Cities! We are growing like never before, and surprisingly, discord seems to have been constrained to the Council Chambers, with little spilling out to bother the people. This is clearly the path of greatest prosperity, and as such, we shall re-organize the entire state in a similar fashion."
 J33_new_land_act_title:0 "Into Untapped Lands"
 J33_new_land_act_desc:0 "Our cities and markets overflow with goods of all form and fashion. But it still seems like it is never enough, and we are constantly in need of additional raw materials. And so we look east, to lands rife with opportunity — for as the Children of the Lake, we must let no opportunity go untapped."
 J33_the_triunic_road_title:0 "The Triunic Road"
 J33_the_triunic_road_desc:0 "Fools look at a city and see only walls and warehouses. Those smarter see a living organism, breathing and growing. But the smartest see a machine, a vast array of cogs and wheels that must be kept running smoothly. As our economic output reaches new heights, there begin to be jams along our roads and caravan-ways, bits of grit that cause delays and disruption, a true threat to the well-being of our people.\n\nWord has reached us from the South, of a conqueror's vast highway built to supply his troops across a continent and further, and of a mechanized rail that allows transport at never-before-seen speeds. We must take the best of these foreigners' ideas and innovate further, and build a great Triunic Road that shall allow every thing and every one to get where they need to go."
 the_triunic_road_tooltip:0 "We will unlock a new decision allowing us to build the §MTriunic road§!!"
 J33_eternal_prosperity_title:0 "Eternal Prosperity"
 J33_eternal_prosperity_desc:0 "We can still remember the before-times. When the Children of the Lake were truly children, and immature, squabbling, short-sighted children at that. We thought we knew prosperity then, but we were wrong. Only now do we see the truth of what prosperity means, and begin to see it in our cities. Where streets were paved with gold, they are now paved with platinum; where towers touched the sky, they now pierce the heavens.\n\nAnd when we look to the future, we see only more and greater works to come. We see a future where the only blood spilled is a dropped bag of rubies scattering its contents along the path, the only conflict that of trade negotiation and marketplace bargaining.\n\nWe see Eternal Prosperity, for all the Children of the Lake, stretching forward, unending, forever."

 J33_the_great_leap_forward_title:0 "The Great Leap Forward"
 J33_the_great_leap_forward_desc:0 "Under the management of the plutocrats, the infrastructure of the Island suffered in favor of fattening their pockets. If we are to ever liberate all of the world's workers, we must quickly make up for this infrastructure deficit. Our leader has proposed a 50 year plan of rapid development, though we will of course make sure that agricultural production keeps up."
 J33_the_textile_industry_title:0 "The Textile Industry"
 J33_the_textile_industry_desc:0 "For too long, the poor of the Triunic cities have gone unclothed, wearing rags while their 'betters' wore fine silks. This must cease, and confiscating the garments of the nobility will not cover all of their needs. Therefore, we must massively expand the textile industry as part of the Great Leap Forward, to make sure that all of the workers are free from want."
 J33_the_metal_industry_title:0 "The Metal Industry"
 J33_the_metal_industry_desc:0 "The factories, the heart of our state, require metals to produce their goods, and metal is needed to build the weapons to defend the revolution. Therefore, a major focus of the Great Leap Forward must be expanding the production of metal, so that the forges of the Revolution never go quiet."
 J33_building_up_the_mainland_title:0 "Building Up the Mainland"
 J33_building_up_the_mainland_desc:0 "As the factories are the heart of the Revolution, those who work within them are naturally the most loyal to it. The mainland, which is highly rural and disorganized, holds the most resentment towards our rule. We can fix this by constructing new factories on the mainland, which will promote both urbanization and the rights of the workers in one fell swoop."
 J33_the_luxury_industry_title:0 "The Luxury Industry"
 J33_the_luxury_industry_desc:0 "While we have railed against the opulence of the oppressing classes in the past, our workers have earned every luxury. An expansion of the luxury industry will create new jobs, grant our workers much deserved rewards, and ensure their ideological loyalty to the Revolution."
 J33_the_black_hands_title:0 "The Black Hands"
 J33_the_black_hands_desc:0 "With the rise of industry across the Forbidden Plains, more fuel is needed than ever. We have discovered an extremely useful source of it in coal, which we naturally sent workers to mine. It has terrible effects on their health, and as such we are obliged to treat them as Heroes of the Federation. It is the least we can do for them."
 J33_the_voices_of_the_people_title:0 "The Voices of the People"
 J33_the_voices_of_the_people_desc:0 "The most efficient way to allocate production is to listen to the people, who know more about local conditions than any bureaucrat. Many rumors have surfaced across the Federation of potential coal mines, but none of them have been heeded due to the incompetence of the inherited Federation bureaucracy. We should devolve industrial planning to local workers in order to fully exploit these resources."
 J33_duty_title:0 "Duty"
 J33_duty_desc:0 "Every citizen has a duty to the Revolution, a duty to do great things. Every worker must contribute to a Great Project, the completion of which will provide benefits for all.

 J33_collectivize_the_banks_desc:0 "With the unification of the Federation, we have inherited many local banks. While banks have their uses, these local ones are dominated by the bourgeoisie, and thus must be nationalized. A central bank will serve the needs of the workers, not those who oppress them."
 J33_national_council_title:0 "National Council"
 J33_national_council_desc:0 "In the past, economics was completely unregulated, with certain individuals able to accumulate vast sums of wealth. Resources went wasted, and the people starved. To remedy this, we will establish a central economic planning committee, so that inequality can never rear its ugly head again."
 J33_the_food_industry_title:0 "The Food Industry"
 J33_the_food_industry_desc:0 "With our massive industrial expansion, many farmers have been drawn from the fields.

 J33_protect_our_merchants_title:0 "Protect Our Merchants"
 J33_protect_our_merchants_desc:0 "While our nation values honesty, other nations still trapped under exploiters do not. Merchants may have been enemies of the workers in the past, but they have recognized their new situation, and are now model citizens.

These humans, however stood little chance before our clans on the wide, open plains. Fearful, they retreated to the islands of the north, leaving the plains to our ancestors. Yet now, a thousand years later, they think themselves safe. They think that their lakes and walls, their boats and soldiers, their so-called “federation” will protect them from the storm that is to come. We will happily show them the error of their ways."

In fact, many of our warriors were amazed at the sheer scale of these monuments of humanity, especially in comparison to the vast emptiness of our current home. As such, efforts must be made to destroy these monuments immediately, and bring the treasures hidden within back to our Caehnate’s heartlands."
 I89_southern_submission_title:0 "The Southern Submission"

As our armies march through the glades, memories of a time long past seem to wash through them. A time of peace, of coexistence. Yet, the world we have inherited is not one of peace, nor one of friendship. It is one of war, of death, of the Caehnate. The storm engulfs our homeland, and rages ever onwards."

Now, however, the pass shall serve a new purpose. A great highway, for our forces to march northwards, and to come down upon Castanor with a fury like no other. Remain ignorant, oh humans, in your precious towns and cities. The storm is coming, to leave only vengeance and destruction in its wake."

Practically, however, it is mired in corruption, internal conflict, and disunity. In other words, ripe for conquest. Our armies shall cross into their jungles in untold numbers, and soon enough, our Caehn shall stand before a palace in Dhenjinsar. Then they shall raze it to rubble. For soon enough, the storm will destroy the tiger."
 I89_under_one_khan_title:0 "Under One Caehn"

 I89_the_ever_growing_hoof_title:0 "§OThe Ever-Growing Hoof§!"
 I89_the_ever_growing_hoof_desc:0 "It seems that our conquests are only speeding up. Each and every day, more land is brought within the Caehnate’s grasp.

They are a warlike race, relishing in the thrill of battle and the glory of war. In many ways they are kindred spirits to centaurkind. As such, they will surely present a worthy foe! May the battlefields run red with the blood of centaur and orc blood, as their tide clashes with our own! Of course, the victor of these conflicts will obviously be us."
 I89_failed_race_title:0 "Failed Race"

They will learn their place as their faces are pounded in by the stampede."
 I89_slow_target_title:0 "Slow Target"
 I89_slow_target_desc:0 "The ogres, mighty as they may be, are nonetheless little more than lumbering brutes, mere target practice for our archers.

 I89_everything_in_the_brain_desc:0 "It seems the gnomes consider themselves the most intelligent race on Halann, and that they may well be, with their fancy artifice and tactics. Yet, what else do they have? Their bodies are short and frail, not even capable of taking on a halfling, let alone a mighty centaur. We will teach them the greatest and last lesson they will ever learn; brawn beats brains."

 I89_years_of_age_desc:0 "The elves are by far the longest-lived, and most magically gifted, of the mortal races, and with age, they tell us, comes wisdom. It is clear to us, however, that all that comes of age and elven magic is decadence. We must put these decrepit old fools in their place once and for all, and teach them that wisdom and magic are nothing in comparison to the thunder of hooves."

 I89_with_one_hoof_desc:0 "The kobolds, of all races, seek to defeat us! When we can crush each one underfoot with barely any effort, the only advantage they seem to have is numbers. Yet, is that truly an advantage, when each new kobold sent to the battlefield will simply be yet another corpse beneath the stampede? Therefore, kobolds will continue to do what they’ve always done; get themselves killed."

Once, they lead the greatest empires Haless has ever seen. Yet, all that is now in the past; the harimari are a mere shadow of their former selves, their empires crumbling with age. Where there empires once stood, we shall build a new one, to make the empire of Harimar’s empire a mere footnote in the history of the centaur conquest of Haless."

Although it would be easy to simply strike them down, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is no coward, and will not show themselves to be one on this day. [Root.Monarch.GetName] in turn removes their weapons and armour, as their opponent smirks, the beating sun causing the two foes to begin to sweat as they face each other down, slowly circling each other, each simultaneously reluctant to make the first move, and thrilled by the prospect of combat. Then, without warning, [Root.Monarch.GetName] charges, fists raised, roaring, kicking up a trail of dust in a single, mighty charge. Their opponent does the same, as the crowd roars in anticipation of the coming battle. Within seconds, the two are clashing at the center of the field, their arms interlocked in a brutal display of unarmed combat, each tryng to outmuscle the other in order to gain victory. There are no tactics. There is no strategy. All that remains is strength, endurance, and pure willpower. As the two push against each other, their hooves begin to throw dust into the air, obscuring the crowd's view almost completely. Until, that is..."
 centaur_tournament.4.db:0 "In the early hours of the afternoon, [Root.Monarch.GetName] steps forth onto the tournament grounds. Wielding a great halberd over two meters long, the Caehn stands proudly in the dimming light of the sun. Before him stands his opponent, a centaur renowned across the Caehnate for their skill with a bow. Although viewed as a relatively cowardly weapon compared to the melee counterparts, the bow is nonetheless a respected tool in any centaur's arsenal due to the skill required to use it. As the Caehn begins trotting toward his foe, they notch an arrow, pull back the bowstring, and fire, a single shot flying through the air, and missing the Caehn by the slightest of margins. They begin notching more and more arrows, unleashing a hail of fire, whilst the Caehn, now in a full charge, thunders towards their foe. The challenger, seeing the Caehn's uncanny ability to dodge, begins galloping across the tournament ground, loosing more and more arrows whilst the Caehn continually charges after them, not letting up for even a second. This exchange continues for what seems like an eternity, the crowd hollering and cheering both [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the challenger, but eventually..."
 centaur_tournament.4.dc:0 "The tournament fields are packed, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] walks onto the battlefield to a thunderous roar of applause. Before him stands one of the mightiest warriors in all of the Caehnate. A warrior clad in thick metal armour, wielding twin lances at their sides. One of the feared and mighty Iomburvlait, viewed by many as some of the most fearsome fighters not just in the Caehnate, but the entire world. Clad in his spiked armour, the Iomburvlait begins a slow, lumbering charge, aiming to knock [Root.Monarch.GetName] off their feet before the match even has the opportunity to properly begin. Reacting quickly, the Caehn rapidly jumps out of their way, spinning their mighty halberd into the Iomburvlait's flank, resulting in a roar of pain. Despite the pain, however, the Iomburvlait continues pushing forward, knowing that even a single of their mighty blows could bring the Caehn to their knees. This exchange keeps up for a long while, the Caehn making small jabs whilst the Iomburvlait desperately attempts to get the single hit that they need to connect. Eventually, however, after both combatants have well and truly exerted themselves..."
 centaur_tournament.4.dd:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] marches onto the tournament grounds, they see before them a rather unique contender, an extremely old, venerable warrior stands before the Caehn, already in their late fifties, they show clear signs of aging. Yet, despite their age, in their eyes can be seen a great deal of cunning, a great deal of strategy, and the knowledge that only the mightiest of warriors is able to reach old age. The venerable warrior charges at [Root.Monarch.GetName], lowering their spear for a single blow. The Caehn does the same, and as the two charge at each other, the young and the venerable, the new and the old, the audience seems to collectively hold their breath. The two charge ever closer to each other, the seconds between hoofbeats feeling like hours, but eventually, the two meet for a single mighty clash in the middle of the grounds. And, from that very clash..."
