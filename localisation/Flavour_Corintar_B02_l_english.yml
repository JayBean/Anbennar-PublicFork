 corintar_the_fields_of_burnoll_title:0 "The Fields of Burnoll"
 corintar_the_fields_of_burnoll_desc:0 "Burnoll is not much to behold: green grass, trees, a few nascent farms. But under that earth is buried a considerable legacy. It is where Castan the Progenitor defeated the Xhazobine, the gnollish horde burned away with silver fire, and a new nation was born from its ashes.\n\nOur patron is Corin, not Castellos, and we are all entrusted with the responsibility of continuing her work, rather than leaving it to a distant silver dragon. But seeing these fields grow, a land that has known rivers of blood — and mountains of ash — now learning peace and prosperity marks a suitable start for our own work just the same."
 corintar_corinite_riders_title:0 "Corinite Riders"
 corintar_corinite_riders_desc:0 ""I never liked horses. And they never liked me. Or Arosha. Or Creekwhistle. Thankfully, the Circle had little in the way of mounts when stuck behind enemy lines, though I know Sir Cecil missed the feeling of a good charge."\n-A brief aside in the memoirs of Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna\n\nSome have interpreted this passage, and Corin's own style of fighting, as proof the Corintar should shun cavalry altogether. In truth, such steeds will be necessary, whether it be for messengers to keep knit our lands as they slowly heal or a rapid-response force to meet orcish raids. Resettling Themin and reclaiming the lands' scattered herds will give us adequate stock to draw upon."
 corintar_aid_from_anbennar_title:0 "Aid From Anbennar"
 corintar_aid_from_anbennar_desc:0 ""Evil knows no borders. Neither does your cause, nor your destiny." -Dominic of Gallowspeak, to Corin, in their conversations about her resurrection.\n\nTo the west, the Empire of Anbennar stands tall, the place where Corin's blade was sharpened and her skills honed. It proclaims unity, but goodness without action means nothing — we must ensure they take up her work with vigor."
 corintar_return_of_the_farmers_title:0 "Return of the Farmers"
 corintar_return_of_the_farmers_desc:0 "Corin left her ruined farm town in Eswall, only to return to Escann a heroine — and more. We must not expect the same transformation from every returning refugee. It will be enough for the people who know the land best to tend it once more, and see it grow lush and verdant under their care."
 corintar_clear_the_woods_title:0 "Clear the Woods"
 corintar_clear_the_woods_desc:0 "Most Escanni shun Oldhaven, speaking in hushed tones of a generations-old curse. Even those that stayed would speak of a land that seemed to fight back against its inhabitants.\n\nBut we are not most Escanni. We are the Corintar, and we do not shy from evil. We will clear these haunted woods and banish whatever lingering shadows remain."
 corintar_enchanted_rain_title:0 "Corin's Blessing"
 corintar_enchanted_rain_desc:0 ""How does she speak to us? She doesn't. She has already told us everything that needed saying, gave all the guidance we would need. Now it's on us to protect and strike true."\n-Lothane Bluetusk\n\nNone would argue with the sentiment of Bluetusk's teachings, but a torrential downpour of crimson rain was certainly more direct of a message than any would predict. Even now that the Deluge is passed, its message and impact lingers on. Its divine magic has seeped into the soil itself, Corin's blessing to her land and people, and all we require is a simple ritual to unlock its potential."
 corintar_rise_of_new_cities_title:0 "Rise of New Cities"
 corintar_rise_of_new_cities_desc:0 "From camp to small hamlet, from hamlet to walled village, and from village to thriving city — the new political and cultural centers of Escann may someday rival great Castonath itself.\n\nThough Corin is Mistress of War, the cities flourishing in our land show that in her wake, there is a deep and lasting prosperity. With her light shining bright, and all darkness banished, we grow and thrive and prosper."
 corintar_monastic_education_title:0 "Monastic Education"
 corintar_monastic_education_desc:0 ""I learned more in one battle at Corin's side than in a decade at Nerat's temples. You will too."\n-Dominic of Gallowspeak\n\nFor most of the Corintar's history, even the most erudite of our members served as soldiers and generals simply as a matter of survival. Peace, and the simple prosperity it brings, has made that less of a guarantee. It is impossible to understand Corin's teachings without also knowing how to stand strong behind a shield, or how to wield a sword in pursuit of justice. We must codify our own curriculum to ensure new members learn these skills, even alongside Dominic's teachings and Bluetusk's memoirs."
 corintar_grannvale_recruits_title:0 "Grannvale Recruits"
 corintar_grannvale_recruits_desc:0 "An emissary has come from Grannvale, a small hamlet in Escerfork. The blue-haired half-elf, Seliff, is the son of the local baron, Sigurd, who ruled the area before the Greentide. Seliff served with the Marcher Lords, but struck out to Grannvale after the Battle of Castonath, seeking to rebuild his ancient home. Though he has made some progress, he claims that with our help the land could be made even brighter — and promises that for as long as his line rules, every man born in Grannvale will serve five years in the Corintar.\n\nThis brave soul is emblematic of Corin's fire itself — let us see his plan through!"
 corintar_marquis_of_the_north_title:0 "Marquis of the North"
 corintar_marquis_of_the_north_desc:0 "Long before Corin mustered the Marcher Lords, it was Arbaran that served as mustering-ground against the Sorcerer-King. Nowadays, the Marquis of Arbaran oversees northeastern border of the Empire of Anbennar, which places it on the border of the lands ravaged by the Greentide. They will thus be instrumental in rebuilding Escann, and we should draw upon our shared history to ensure they take that role with Corin’s values at heart (and that they send any fervent recruits our way, of course)."
 corintar_envoy_to_the_borders_title:0 "Envoy to the Borders"
 corintar_envoy_to_the_borders_desc:0 "The Anbennarian Marquisate of Arannen may be far to the south, but its location on the edge of Daravan’s Folly places it close to Bal Dostan, the southern entrance into Castanor. Because of this, it would be advantageous to establish a chapter there in order to ensure that this route is used to favour Corin’s followers."
 corintar_the_gawed_embassy_title:0 "The Gawed Embassy"
 corintar_the_gawed_embassy_desc:0 "Gawed has always been one of the major powers in Cannor, and even though its attention is currently focused elsewhere, it is located right on the border of the fractured Castanorian lands. Maintaining good relations with them is paramount to the success of the Corinite mission, and a permanent embassy is necessary to this end. Establishing further chapters in the lands around Gaweton will only serve to strengthen our influence in the region."
 corintar_chapter_recruits_title:0 "Chapter Recruits"
 corintar_chapter_recruits_desc:0 "Years ago, we watched as many of our faithful trickled out of our lands to set up chapters across Cannor. Now, their efforts bear fruit as thousands of devout followers of Corin from across the continent march to our recruiting centers, filled with tales of our greatness."
 corintar_restructure_the_ranks_title:0 "Restructure the Ranks"
 corintar_restructure_the_ranks_desc:0 ""Once a week, I ended my responsibilities early, passing off whatever I could to Aucan or Winston, until he left. I would go to the training fields and watch the new recruits train under Rethag and listen to Dominic's sermons. It wasn't much of a break, but it was enough. To shepherd these people who could not yet hold a sword into Corin's light — it was enough."\n-The memoirs of Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna\n\nThe Corintar once again finds itself flush with recruits, ready to fight for Corin but liable to break at the first sign of real battle. Our seasoned generals will shape them into a professional army worthy of the Corintar."
 corintar_the_corinsfall_decree_title:0 "The Corinsfall Decree"
 corintar_the_corinsfall_decree_desc:0 ""For goodness without action means nothing, and from nothing the roots of evil will fester."\n-The Corinite Creed\n\nAnd so it was decreed, at the height of the Crimson Deluge, that in order to serve in the administration of the Corintar, each officer must swear an oath of righteous violence against all who lack conviction in the Corinite faith."
 corintar_corintar_leadership_title:0 "Corintar Leadership"
 corintar_corintar_leadership_desc:0 ""It won't be easy, championing her cause now. But you knew that already."\n-Dominic of Gallowspeak, in a private conversation to Lothane Bluetusk\n\nLeading the Corinite cause has been our destiny, as Corin's chosen. At the crossroads of Anbennar's future, we will be Corin's voice and sword once again, and lead all of her people, not just those within our borders."
 corintar_retrain_our_diplomats_title:0 "Retrain Our Diplomats"
 corintar_retrain_our_diplomats_desc:0 ""They laugh at me, every time, but I always walk away with the better deal."\n-Winston Foolfoot\n\nThe Great Purge damaged many parts of our administration, but none moreso than our diplomatic corps. What was once a powerful institution respected across Cannor lost most of its talent and contacts when the chapters disbanded and the moderates in our administration were purged. With our zealotry tempered, it is time to rebuild Corintari diplomacy."
 corintar_escann_restored_title:0 "Escann Restored"
 corintar_escann_restored_desc:0 ""I should like to see this river again, someday, when it is not so flush with blood."\n-Corin, from the memoirs of Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna\n\nCorin surely smiles today. A land that was once blackened by fields of corpses is teeming with life. The fields bloom, the cities thrive, and the very river mentioned in Lothane's memoir is preserved as a holy site, so that all of the faithful in the Corintar may be reminded of the simple beauty that we have worked so hard to achieve."
 corintar_a_base_of_operations_title:0 "From Tents to Castles"
 corintar_a_base_of_operations_desc:0 "The Battle of Castonath is long passed, and our days as an adventuring band have passed with it. The future of Escann depends on our stewardship, and we must begin here, at [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 corintar_corintar_chapters_title:0 "Corintar Chapters"
 corintar_corintar_chapters_desc:0 "Though almost all of the adventurers in Escann fought alongside Corin, not all of them hold the same loyalty to her circle. We must not let these divisions interfere with our shared goal of a restored Escann. Instead of a formal embassy, we will establish a Corintar chapter in their lands, so that those loyal to Corin's cause even outside of our borders have a place to gather and serve Escann."
 corintar_secure_the_southgate_title:0 "Secure the Southgate"
 corintar_secure_the_southgate_desc:0 "The Southgate still stands, a crumbling monument to the faith old Escann placed in thick stone walls. We will rebuild the gate, of course, but to defend the region, we will build local castles, train the local militias, and establish a series of watchposts and guards. In this way, a new Greentide will never again break these lands."
 corintar_the_city_of_stone_title:0 "The City of Stone"
 corintar_the_city_of_stone_desc:0 ""Castonath is overrated. Sure, it’s got history behind it, there’re some fine markets and taverns... but it’s got enough corruption for a whole kingdom, and every Patrician is just so damned full of themselves. Still, when you have a city that massive, you have no choice but to do something with it."\n-Rethag Ironbrow, Marshal of the Corintar.\n\nWith Castonath in our hands, we control the largest city for hundreds of miles, and all the associated wealth and prestige. Rebuilding this ancient symbol will go a long way towards restoring Escann."
 corintar_corinsfall_memorial_title:0 "Corinsfall Memorial"
 corintar_corinsfall_memorial_desc:0 ""A week by Corin's side lasted a lifetime, and yet a week without her seems longer still."\n-Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna\n\nAn unassuming plaza in Lower Castonath holds the site of the final battle of the Greentide. It is said that Lothane visited every year on the anniversary of Corin's death, and when he finally passed away, his body was burned in that plaza so that wherever she went, Lothane might follow. Properly honoring Corin's death means setting aside this area, and rebuilding it not as a place of residence or commerce, but as a place of worship for all of Corin's faithful to be gather."
 corintar_the_corinite_crusaders_title:0 "The Corinite Crusaders"
 corintar_the_corinite_crusaders_desc:0 "Zealous Corinites are called to purge evil wherever and whenever they find it. This can mean criminals who are dealt swift vigilante justice, heretics sympathetic to Adean's pretendership, or even other Corinites who are traitorous to the cause. Many of these Corinite Crusaders, as they are known, are finding their way to the Corintar and joining our army en masse."
 corintar_blood_in_the_streets_title:0 "Blood in the Streets"
 corintar_blood_in_the_streets_desc:0 "The righteous purge of the Crusaders is often meant well, but sometimes lacks direction. By giving them a target to focus their zealotry toward, we can ensure that all of our subjects follow the true faith."
 corintar_tension_abroad_title:0 "Tension Abroad"
 corintar_tension_abroad_desc:0 "With the rising tension between the Corintar and her chapters, the local connections the chapters once offered have been less receptive to our diplomats. By switching tactics, we can distance ourselves from our chapters to bolster our position domestically."
 corintar_the_great_purge_title:0 "The Great Purge"
 corintar_the_great_purge_desc:0 ""You cannot negotiate with evil. It cannot be given a single moment of respite, a single crevice to fester."\n-Sir Laurens sil Place\n\nCorin's wars must be prosecuted with fiery zeal, her cause must be championed by those who believe without hesitation. There is no room for indecision, there is no room for hesitation. The Corintar must be led by men and women with unquestionable conviction, and all who do not rise to this standard have no place in our leadership!"
 corintar_the_corinite_accord_title:0 "The Corinite Accord"
 corintar_the_corinite_accord_desc:0 ""We were a dozen strangers before we met Corin. Our bond transcends her death, and it is shared by every member of the Corintar."\n-Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna, in his first speech to the Corintar\n\nEscann was never large enough to contain Corin's light. It burns across Cannor, and across the Empire of Anbennar. The test of faith that the Empire had avoided for so long can no longer be avoided. The faith of the Empire hangs in the balance, and we must prepare."
 corintar_corinite_refugees_title:0 "Corinite Refugees"
 corintar_corinite_refugees_desc:0 "Across Cannor, Corinite farmers, merchants, and soldiers are being expelled from their homelands and looking for a new place to call home. Corin's shield protects as fiercely as her sword strikes true; we must immediately prepare to receive these refugees (and their aid in economic redevelopment and military strategy will undoubtedly be invaluable as well)."
 corintar_corins_champion_title:0 "Corin's Champion"
 corintar_corins_champion_desc:0 ""You have a sword: use it."\n-Rethag Ironbrow\n\nAll of Anbennar — indeed, all of Cannor — stands at the precipice of war, a dark shadow looming across the continent. Though the divine Regent Court clings to a tenuous peace, the fate of us mortals is more dire.\n\nNone stood beside Corin more fervently than her Circle, and none carried her words and sword more zealously than the Corintar. It is up to us to see her work to completion. We shall choose a paragon among us, one who can lead and fight almost as well as Corin once did, and with them, none will challenge our right to lead the Corinite cause in Anbennar."
 corintar_the_fate_of_anbennar_title:0 "The Fate of Anbennar"
 corintar_the_fate_of_anbennar_desc:0 "Anbennar at last is united under Corin! A bloody war serves as an appropriately mortal conclusion to the divine struggle that began so long ago during the Crimson Deluge, and our triumph is a fitting tribute to the Mistress of War. Our forces are exhausted and battered, but victorious nonetheless. Let there be doubt no longer — Corin's ascent is complete!"
 corintar_a_new_doctrine_title:0 "A New Doctrine"
 corintar_a_new_doctrine_desc:0 ""Her teachings are as alive as any plant or creature. To see them idle is to see them powerless."\n-Dominic of Gallowspeak\n\nThe teachings of Corin so closely held since the Deluge have become dangerously close to stagnation. Fervent beliefs gone unchallenged lead to decadence, like the complacent Adeanics before us. We must open a new theological dialogue, an exploration of Corinite in all of its forms, even ones rejected long ago."
 corintar_the_reconciliation_title:0 "The Reconciliation"
 corintar_the_reconciliation_desc:0 ""I tried to kill her. Twice. Fate may take a twisted road, but we end up where we are needed all the same."\n-Dominic of Gallowspeak\n\nThe Corintar chapters that split from us during the Great Purge did not disappear entirely. Stalwart members of the faith continued working in the shadows, spreading Corin's message where it was needed the most and sending aid to budding Corinite causes. Despite our profound differences in methods, neither the shadow chapters nor Corintar proper has had the full success we have both worked so hard to achieve. To match Corin's ambitions, we must combine our resources, unite our tactics, and rebuild ourselves as New Corintar."
 corintar_corintar_reborn_title:0 "Corintar Reborn"
 corintar_corintar_reborn_desc:0 ""We are the Corintar. We outlived the Dookanson, we will outlive me. The only thing we shall not outlive is the goddess herself."\n-Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna, during his retirement speech\n\nThough Escann's bounty seems endless under our guardianship, outside of our borders lies another endless conflict, another generation of battle to a land that has not known peace for two hundred years. The war we fight now seems like any other, bar one key difference — this war shall be Escann's last. We are Escann's Defenders, and through our works have proven ourselves the rightful heir to all of her lands. We will reclaim this land, and in doing so, ensure that it never sees bloodshed again."
 corintar_united_under_corin_title:0 "United Under Corin"
 corintar_united_under_corin_desc:0 "Our faith and our purpose are inextricably linked. If we are to unite Escann, we must start by uniting ourselves."
 corintar_reconstruction_missions_title:0 "Reconstruction Missions"
 corintar_reconstruction_missions_desc:0 "While training militias, our missions also proselytize nearby towns. While fortifying cities, our architects also design monasteries. While rebuilding farmhouses, our laborers also rebuild temples.\n\nThe people will remember who helped them protect themselves, they will remember who helped them feed themselves — they will remember Corin's grace."
 corintar_opening_orc_relations_title:0 "Opening Orc Relations"
 corintar_opening_orc_relations_desc:0 "While the worst of the fighting ended in Castonath, Escanni orcs and humans are still constantly fighting border skirmishes, raids, and incursions. If Escann is ever to truly heal, we must work with our orcish neighbors to prevent the constant raids."
 corintar_trade_with_grombar_title:0 "Trade With Grombar"
 corintar_trade_with_grombar_desc:0 "To the north lies a thriving fur and fish trade, both goods in high demand in Escann. This trade is controlled by the Gray Orcs. Though many in the Alenic Reach see them as invaders, we believe their frosted gates can be warmed with Corin's light, and bring great trade wealth to our lands."
 corintar_into_the_woods_title:0 "Into the Woods"
 corintar_into_the_woods_desc:0 "With the Green Orc petition firmly in our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s mind, the woods to our east have been restored. Many of our orcish citizens are flocking to the region, and we look forward to seeing them prosper."
 corintar_rise_of_the_redtusks_title:0 "Rise of the Redtusks"
 corintar_rise_of_the_redtusks_desc:0 "The Redtusk phenomenon is beginning to spread between many of our orc citizens. Devout Corinites, they have largely cast off the cultural differences between their clans in favor of unity under Corin's teachings."
 corintar_valley_of_the_orcs_title:0 "Valley of the Orcs"
 corintar_valley_of_the_orcs_desc:0 "With a rich and prosperous wooded valley to call their own, our orcish population has continued to thrive. More orcs identify as Redtusk every day, and the strip of red has become a status symbol and fashion statement as well. A booming cloth industry, largely orc-run, has opened, and the Redtusk culture is ready to spread across our heartlands."
 corintar_rabble_reorganized_title:0 "Rabble Reorganized"
 corintar_rabble_reorganized_desc:0 ""Give me a hot enough forge, and I can remake even the dullest of swords." -Rethag Ironbrow\n\nOur army was a mess -- and now it is not. Now, it is a sword for Corin's cause, a shield for her people, and the core of the Corintar."
 corintar_devastation_we_wrought_title:0 "Devastation We Wrought"
 corintar_devastation_we_wrought_desc:0 ""Six thousand souls died at Rottenstep; only one returned." -Dominic of Gallowspeak's Great Sermon at Corinsfall\n\nDominic spoke of the great irony of Corin: the living avatar of War had a strong distaste for it. For every river stained black with blood, for every farmhouse missing its farmer, she fought harder and fiercer, so that the land might someday learn peace.\n\nOur enemies today may not be orcish raiders, our battlefields may not be the wooded valleys of east Escann, but the devastation in our wake calls back a memory of the Greentide nonetheless. We must pause and reflect: is this Corin's will?"
 corintar_escann_defended_title:0 "Escann Defended"
 corintar_escann_defended_desc:0 ""To think, these crumbling walls held the fate of kingdoms. We can do better."\n-Corin, as recorded in the memoirs of Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna\n\nThe age of feudal kingdoms in Escann is passed, and the land and its people need a new defensive doctrine. A century of monastic work has left every town, every city, every peasant, and every farmer armed and ready to fight for their lands and families. Corin and her people have not only saved Escann from the Greentide of the past, but from future invasions as well."
 corintar_lothanes_legacy_title:0 "Lothane's Legacy"
 corintar_lothanes_legacy_desc:0 ""I could live a dozen lifetimes and never match what she has done for us. Never repay what she did for me. But I only had one life. And I can only hope that I have done enough."\n-Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna, during his retirement speech\n\nWhen many of Corin's Circle scattered on her death, Lothane stayed behind to guide her most devout followers into a new era. His military and administrative reforms turned the Corintar from a simple adventuring band into a modern state, the organized political and military arm of Corin's will. With his passing, the Corintar mourns, though the institutions he built continue to thrive today."
 corintar_lumber_shortage_title:0 "Lumber Shortage"
 corintar_lumber_shortage_desc:0 "We have a problem: insufficient lumber to rebuild Escann’s shattered villages. But we also have a solution clearly in view. Before the Nath river enters Castonath, it passes through vast forests. These lay within the White Walls, so we may set up extensive lumber camps while rebuilding nearby fortifications to repel orc raids."
 corintar_hematite_mines_title:0 "Hematite Mines"
 corintar_hematite_mines_desc:0 "Each of our soldiers shall bear a streak of red on his shield, a physical manifestation of the oath they swore to Corin and to the Corintar. What was once an expensive proposition has been made possible by a clan of pious dwarves, who have shared their recent discoveries in Bradnath. Inside the old iron mines lies the blood-red mineral hematite, from which we will forge the shields for the order."
 corintar_break_the_bladebreakers_title:0 "Break the Bladebreakers"
 corintar_break_the_bladebreakers_desc:0 ""Once, I'd have sold my soul to see the Bladebreaker chief struck down. Now, how can I have room in my soul for hatred, when I have pledged it all to her?"\n-The memoirs of Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna\n\nLothane rarely spoke of the brutal ending of his time with the Bladebreakers: the failed Ozarm'chadash, his fellow half-orcs slain, those days in the pit. But as leader of the Corintar, Lothane never sought vengeance against the orcish clan he was born to. So firm was his conviction in Corin's teachings, that his only dream for them was to see her light, as he did. With the recent integration of their territories, we may put Lothane's dream to rest."
 corintar_seal_the_serpentspine_title:0 "Seal the Serpentspine"
 corintar_seal_the_serpentspine_desc:0 "One day, we will shield all of Halann with Corin's light. Until then, we cannot risk everything we have accomplished by spreading our defences too thin. We must build a fort to divide Escann from the Serpentspine and free our soldiers to pacify Escann proper."
 corintar_the_mountain_pass_title:0 "The Mountain Pass"
 corintar_the_mountain_pass_desc:0 ""Mountains? Overrated. Unless you have to hold out against enemies a hundred times your strength, then they’re quite nice."\n-Rethag Ironbrow\n\nSecuring the mountain passes to Escann’s north will plug a hole in our armour, and provide our people a sense of security that no horde shall come pouring out of them to devastate the land again."
 corintar_abolition_enforced_title:0 "Abolition Enforced"
 corintar_abolition_enforced_desc:0 ""She breaks the chains that bind us to the past. I shall never wear mine again."\n-Arosha Oathbreaker\n\nWhere Corin taught forgiveness, many held grudges. Where Corin taught honor, many caved to greed. And where Corin taught equality, many turned aside. We cannot sit idle while this perversion of the Corinite faith festers — we will end orcish slavery for good, through guile and trade if we can, through blood and steel if we must."
 corintar_orcish_resurgence_title:0 "Orcish Resurgence"
 corintar_orcish_resurgence_desc:0 "It has been a long journey, fraught with challenge and opposition, but the Green Orcs once on the brink of annihilation have once again flooded Escann. This time, they are not conquerors under the Dookanson, but acolytes under Corin. It was always her dream for orcs to walk among humans as equals, and death again fails to halt her ambition."
 corintar_carmine_red_title:0 "Carmine Red"
 corintar_carmine_red_desc:0 "A Redtusk logger was the first to discover it: the fly that buzzed around him as he harvested another sturdy oak did not bleed when it was crushed — it held a deep red dye inside. Richer and more easily woven into cloth, it became the dye of choice for the local Redtusk community. In mere weeks, the woods across the Corintar were abuzz with loggers crushing Carmine Red. [Root.Capital.GetName] became an epicenter of the dye trade almost overnight, and Carmine Red is now bought and sold all across Cannor.\n\nToday, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stands at his balcony and surveys the fruit of this discovery — eighty thousand soldiers stand before him, holding eighty thousand shields, each painted with the burning red insignia of the Corintar."

 flavor_corintar.3.t:0 "Lothane Bluetusk's Leadership"
 flavor_corintar.3.d:0 "Memories. Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna has lots of those.\n\nHis earliest, the soft hands and warm tears of his mother, Ellis the Blue; a relic of hers to add to the Silmuna name and the blue scarf forever tied around his left tusk. His most recent, standing mere steps away from Corin, yet seemingly galaxies apart, as she rose her shield to defend him, slew and was slain by the Dookanson, and he watched the woman who had saved his life and his heart become something more.\n\nBut there are plenty of others that thrum through his mind as he sits in his tent in [Root.Capital.GetName], knowing soon he must rise and speak to Corin's — now whose? — Circle. His bitterest, watching sprawled on the ground, his sword and the two fingers it had carved from Karagh Bloodfist laying mere meters away, yet his arm still numb from the warleader's victorious blow in the Ozarm'chadash, as his fellow half-orcs were executed to the man. His darkest, the time in a pit after that, cursing every god he knew the name of. His brightest, the sight of a human face, the red hair encircling it lit bright by the setting sun, offering him freedom from the pit in the ground and in his soul.\n\nAnd from there, it seems Corin is a bright red thread tangled through all his memories. His proudest, rising in a council of the Marcher Lords, seeing every face turn to him to outline their strategy — but his eyes only caught one other's. His most perplexed, as they spoke one night of her death at Rottenstep, and he strained his mind to encompass it. His most joyful, that night by the campfire, not even two weeks ago.\n\nBut all that is the past now, severed as permanently from the present as Corin is now from mere mortality. It is just another thing he carries, like the scarf on his tusk. And so it is time for him to rise, speak to Her circle and Her followers. Her work is not yet done, and it is up to us on Halann to see it through."

 flavor_corintar.4.t:0 "Lothane Bluetusk Retires"
 flavor_corintar.4.d:0 "It's not easy work, leading the Corintar. In fact it's quite difficult, shepherding this ragtag band of adventurers into something more. Even though the manic chaos of those first few years has passed, when he forged a broken circle into Escann's sword and shield, Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna's work has not yet ceased.\n\nThere are always more campaigns to plan, even if he is not at their vanguard. There are always more adventuring disputes to smooth over, the same arguments arising again and again to the point he feels he could handle them in his sleep. There are always more forms to sign, more work orders to requisition, more trade agreements to be forged, new land to divvy up and old grudges to sort out. It's enough that the days blur by, sometimes. And the weeks, and the months. And the years.\n\nOr so Lothane realizes, one day, as he sits at his desk in the center of [Root.Capital.GetName]. What once was a command tent became the largest room in a hastily-constructed fort, then a similar space in a somewhat more sturdy fort, and now they've relocated him into one of the growing city's new castles. But when he puts down the paperwork, and steps into the stone hallways outside, he realizes he doesn't know anyone in the Corintar by name anymore.\n\nHe can still remember, vividly, Arosha's wicked grin as she bested him in a duel, Foolfoot's smile as he dealt a round of cards, Creekwhistle's fiery anger. But the faces that scurry through dusty corridors and bring him forms to sign, all those souls in the nearby, newly built houses? They all love and respect him, but not a single one knows him.\n\nHe's pretty sure he's the only one that remembers the heft of Corin's blade, the dented steel of her shield; all the icons that crop up carved into wood or sketched on parchment don't quite capture it. And the ribbon around his tusk has frayed to mere strands.\n\nIt's time to go. Put down the sword, let someone else hold the shield. A quill, and a piece of parchment, and memories of love and loyalty and something more will do for him now."

 flavor_corintar.5.t:0 "The Funeral of Lothane Bluetusk"
 flavor_corintar.5.da:0 "In Escann, half-orcs die. Like any mortal being, it is the one fate common to each. Mere moments after entering the world for some, after long strife-filled decades for others. They die from battle, from hunger, from illness, from all the scourges of a war-torn land. Only ever-so-rarely do they die having lived a hundred years and change, surrounded by their children, their legacy secure.\n\nBut — defying the odds one last time — that is how Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna died today.\n\nThe past few decades had been busy — but not unkind — for the half-orc. There was a small cottage, in the yet-untamed woods on the outskirts of [Root.Capital.GetName]. There was learning to share what remained of his heart. There was even an unexpected joy, raising children. And above all else, there was the writing, the memories.\n\nBluetusk had traded his sword and shield for quill and parchment, calloused hands working long hours by candlelight. For there was so much to share, so much that needed to be known. His first conversation with Corin, the night after she rescued him from the pit. The lessons in ethics and morals gathered accompanying her into battle. And all those hours the night before the Battle of Castonath, the most searing glimpse he ever got of her burning soul. Wherever it was she had gone, he remained on Halann, and so did so many who needed to learn her ways.\n\nBut that is past, now. It is time for him to be laid to rest, his crusade finally coming to an end. He shall be mourned across the Corintar, across Escann. And perhaps, in wherever it is the Gods reside, the lady he gave his heart and soul to shall mourn him as well."

Among the bustling cities and open fields of our heartlands, many Green Orcs feel distant from the dense foliage of the woodlands they used to call home. Several prominent Green Orc leaders have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and requested [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] help in establishing an orcish enclave in the eastern woods, a region under the Corintar banner where orcs across Escann can gather and celebrate their shared heritage."

Nowhere do they live a good life, never do they die of old age surrounded by loved ones, or in a battle for a cause greater than mere survival.\n\nExcept. Except in the Corintar, in the pocket of land we have made a home for the orcs who have seen Corin's light and pledged to follow Her truth. Lothane 'Bluetusk' lived a great life, a life he would not change a piece of. But he would be the first to have you know it was not a good life, not necessarily, filled from the beginning with sorrow and pain and loss. Fighting as part of Corin's swords, living under Her shield, the orcs of the Corintar will have the chance for greatness. More importantly though, in the woods and valleys of Escann, with scraps of red cloth tied around their tusks, they might live to farm and hunt and raise a family and die in bed.

 flavor_corintar.40.d:0 "In the wake of the Deluge, once small bands of Corinite Crusaders have swelled their ranks, and roam between our cities with a savage zealotry. Any Adeanic sympathizers and Regent Court enclaves are often attacked directly, and forced to convert or leave their homes. This has come to a head in one of our larger cities, where a temple of Nerat was burned to the ground for allegedly harboring Adeanics. The ensuing violence between the Crusaders and the clergy has left the city wounded, but fully Corinite."

 flavor_corintar.41.d:0 "The inner circle of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was a place where any advisor clever enough to get the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ear could find his concerns heard by the court, and answered in course. Recently, however, the rising tension of the Crimson Deluge has darkened this once mighty court. Zealous administrators and nobles across the court have become increasingly hostile to those who they see as insufficiently devoted to the cause.\n\nThis has come to a head as a prominent advisor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has openly called to rein in some of the senseless violence of the Corinite Crusaders. His opponents in court have seized this opportunity to paint him as a traitor to Corin herself, and are calling for his head."

 flavor_corintar.42.d:0 "A seemingly endless mob of Corinite Crusaders march into the Corintar, eager to fight in her ranks in the name of Corin herself. Though our numbers swell every time we recruit more Crusaders, our generals and support staff often struggle to keep up. Undisciplined soldiers often make it onto the battlefield, sometimes to overwhelm our enemies through sheer numbers, and sometimes to break at the first sign of battle."

Navigating orcish customs, so alien to our human diplomats, is fraught with danger, but our Redtusk diplomats seem to negotiate these challenges with ease.

Praise for one of our chapters has reached our lands, as reports come in that a feral vampire has been hunted and killed by members of this chapter.
