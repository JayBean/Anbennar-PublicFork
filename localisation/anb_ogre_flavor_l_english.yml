 feast_of_the_gods_reform_1:0 "Intensive Agriculture"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_1_desc:0 "In order to wean our people off from wanton cannibalism, we must first heavily invest into our food production. Combined with a strict system of quotas, price adjustments, and compelled labor, we should be able to produce enough food to keep our people (relatively) happy and fed."
 
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_2:0 "Funerary Cannibalism"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_2_desc:0 "Cannibalism as a concept is far too ingrained into our culture and beliefs for its complete abolition to be utterly inconsiderable. Instead, we must codify the appropriate time and place for consuming the flesh of others. This should also have the welcome side effect of ensuring that the soul of a ruler is passed down to their heir, limiting the ability of pretenders to press their claims."
 sacrifice_reform_tt:0 "Has sacrificed 7 rulers"

 feast_of_the_gods_reform_3:0 "Abolish the Flesh Tithe"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_3_desc:0 "Throughout our history, we have been painted as villains for our practice of forgiving unpaid debts in exchange for the flesh of our clients. Abolishing this tradition may harm us in the short term, but in the long run will do wonders for our public image. Besides, any who bend to knee to us will still be aware of what we’re capable of, and should be much more willing to cooperate with our demands."

 feast_of_the_gods_reform_4:0 "Public Feasts"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_4_desc:0 "Though our people may be discontent at our attempts to bring them into the modern day, we have devised a means to keep their ire at bay. We shall pour money into our temples and public institutions to throw grand feasts for the people on each of our most important holidays. Between the free food, drink, and decor, hopefully none will mind the slightly reduced menu."

 feast_of_the_gods_reform_5:0 "Battlefield Exceptions"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_5_desc:0 "We may be spending the brunt of our efforts on drastically scaling back the role of cannibalism in our society, it may still be useful to retain a few outlets for the most voracious among us. By allowing our soldiers to unleash their pent-up hunger on the battlefield, none will be able to stand in the way of our frenzied charges."

 feast_gods_events.0.d:0 "A local lord enters the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] palace. “My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! I have come to pledge my full loyalty and support to you. As a sign of goodwill, I offer you a cart full of delicious corpses ready to be eaten. I hope you enjoy this tribute as a worthy [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should.”\n\nWhile the offer is tempting, perhaps rejecting it would be a better option if we wish to set an example for the rest of our subjects."
 feast_gods_events.0.a:0 "Get this man out of here and throw his bribe into the river!"
 feast_gods_events.0.b:0 "Thank you my vassal, I shall feast on your tribute!"

 feast_gods_events.1.t:0 "Ravenous Ogre Causes Havoc"
 feast_gods_events.1.d:0 "Hunger is the most characteristic aspect of an ogre, especially for the meat of others. However, during times of special scarcity, like the current one, this meat is a rare privilege, leaving our state with the task of providing food to our people. Some of our populace, however, have begun to refuse to eat their new foods as a form of protest. While these protests are mostly harmless, the hunger has in recent days caused a local ogre to go on a rampage, eating other people.\n\nWhile this would normally be a tragedy, the reaction has been surprising, with most of the local ogres openly envious, wishing it could have been them who got to indulge and go on a feeding rampage."
 feast_gods_events.1.a:0 "It's just an isolated incident. Nothing to worry about, I hope."
 feast_gods_events.1.b:0 "We must indulge on occasion, lest we go mad. Call for a feast!"

 feast_gods_events.2.t:0 "The Hunger for Battle"
 feast_gods_events.2.d:0 "It is mainly during war that our soldiers find the time to indulge and eat the bodies of the fallen. This has served us greatly during periods of continuous war, but our recent extended peace has upset our soldiers. Some of them have even begun to take out their anger and frustration on the commoners of our realm, terrorizing them. We have been urged to take action, lest we face more serious consequences in the future."
 feast_gods_events.2.a:0 "Eat some corpses and maybe you'll calm down a little."
 feast_gods_events.2.b:0 "Let them be. The next time they fight will be a bloodbath."
 feast_gods_events.2.c:0 "Terrorizing you say? Perhaps they might be of use…"
