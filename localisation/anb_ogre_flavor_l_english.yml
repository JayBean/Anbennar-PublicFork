 feast_of_the_gods_reform_1:0 "Intensive Agriculture"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_1_desc:0 "In order to wean our people off from wanton cannibalism, we must first heavily invest into our food production. Combined with a strict system of quotas, price adjustments, and compelled labor, we should be able to produce enough food to keep our people (relatively) happy and fed."
 
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_2:0 "Funerary Cannibalism"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_2_desc:0 "Cannibalism as a concept is far too ingrained into our culture and beliefs for its complete abolition to be utterly inconsiderable. Instead, we must codify the appropriate time and place for consuming the flesh of others. This should also have the welcome side effect of ensuring that the soul of a ruler is passed down to their heir, limiting the ability of pretenders to press their claims."

 feast_of_the_gods_reform_3:0 "Abolish the Flesh Tithe"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_3_desc:0 "Throughout our history, we have been painted as villains for our practice of forgiving unpaid debts in exchange for the flesh of our clients. Abolishing this tradition may harm us in the short term, but in the long run will do wonders for our public image. Besides, any who bend to knee to us will still be aware of what we’re capable of, and should be much more willing to cooperate with our demands."

 feast_of_the_gods_reform_4:0 "Public Feasts"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_4_desc:0 "Though our people may be discontent at our attempts to bring them into the modern day, we have devised a means to keep their ire at bay. We shall pour money into our temples and public institutions to throw grand feasts for the people on each of our most important holidays. Between the free food, drink, and decor, hopefully none will mind the slightly reduced menu."

 feast_of_the_gods_reform_5:0 "Battlefield Exceptions"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_5_desc:0 "We may be spending the brunt of our efforts on drastically scaling back the role of cannibalism in our society, it may still be useful to retain a few outlets for the most voracious among us. By allowing our soldiers to unleash their pent-up hunger on the battlefield, none will be able to stand in the way of our frenzied charges."
