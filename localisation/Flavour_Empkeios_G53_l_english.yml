# The Chendhya Route
 empkeios_events.2101.t: "The Chendhya Route"
 empkeios_events.2101.d: "For centuries, wares, goods, but mostly slaves have flowed west through the Chendhya plains. This route is arduous and often times dangerous. Now a major trading power of Alecand, Empkeios, is offering us a deal. With our partnership, it should be possible to pacify the region, facilitate trade flow, and ultimately enrich us all. Should we accept?"
 empkeios_events.2101.a: "For a long, true, and lasting friendship!"

 empkeios_events.2102.d: "For centuries, wares, goods, but mostly slaves have flowed west through the Chendhya plains. This route is arduous and often times dangerous. Our proposed deal, however, with the most prominent native group of the Chendhya, has been accepted and everything will change forever. With this partnership, it should we shall pacify the region, facilitate trade flow, and ultimately enrich us all. This is a momentous occasion!"

 empkeios_events.2102.btt: "A new alliance has been formed!"
# The Chendhya Route - NO
 empkeios_events.2103.t: "The Chendhya Route"
 empkeios_events.2103.d: "For centuries, wares, goods, but mostly slaves have flowed west through the Chendhya plains. This route is arduous and often times dangerous. Our proposed deal with the most prominent native group of the Chendhya, despite our best intentions, has been rejected. The route will remain harsh for every traveller and trader, and the region will remain divided. While clearly regrettable, we shall look forward and find new ways to pacify the region and ensure prosperity."
 empkeios_events.2103.a: "If they are not with us, they are against us."
 empkeios_events.2103.att: "We might get a chance to act again if we gain our independence."
# The Chendhya Route - A New Chance
 empkeios_events.2104.t: "The Chendhya Route: A New Chance"
 empkeios_events.2104.d: "When we tried a peaceful approach to facilitating trade and travel through the Chendhya, we were rejected. That proposal, however, was made years ago, when we were but a mere weak subject. Now, the dawn of a new era is upon us. Empkeios is now independent, and a new chance is presented to us to try again to make the Chendhya Route a new and prosperous trade avenue."
 empkeios_events.2104.a: "They rejected us once. Now we will make sure prosperity is not rejected."

# The Shadow of Rebellion - Chain Start
 empkeios_events.1301.t: "The Shadow of Rebellion looms over Empkeios"
 empkeios_events.1301.d: "We have set up a formidable slave trade system. Slaves from far and wide find themselves in Empkeios to work our lands or just in passing, towards final work places near and far.\nNevertheless, the foundations of our independence reside in equality. We fought our Alecandi oppressors for our equal rights to trade, prosper and live. The sheer hypocrisy that this represents when paired with our magnificent slave-based system is obvious to everyone. While our own citizens may be willing to look the other way, even if just for the sake of an easier life, our rivals, and specially the slaves, clearly are taking issue.\nNow, with the consolidation of our power in Kehionai and the rising of the standards of living in our nation, ideas of rebellion are starting to run wild among the slave population."
 empkeios_events.1301.a: "A spectre is haunting Empkeios."
# A leader amongst unfree people
 empkeios_events.1302.t: "A leader amongst unfree people"
 empkeios_events.1302.d: "An educated slave by the name of §RLeyan'd Lanahasha§! seems to have become the hottest topic amongst the slave population, both in transit and working in Empkeios. She seems to have gained quite a following, and her ideas of emancipation and blatant and unhinged criticism to our 'hypocritical' values and governing system have gained her some prestige here and abroad.\n\nShe seems to be quite skilled at avoiding our efforts to find her, for no matter how hard every administration and state in our nation has tried to capture here, she has always escaped without trace.\n\nNow, there's a growing concern that she may become influential enough to rally people behind her in an all-out uprising. Specially so if she manages international support. "
 empkeios_events.1302.a: "We shall hunt her at all costs!"
 empkeios_events.1302.b: "We will have our best men following her every step."
# A Rebellion in the making in Empkeios - Rivals
 empkeios_events.1303.t: "A Rebellion in the making in Empkeios"
 empkeios_events.1303.d: "In our rival nation of Empkeios, a rebellion is brewing amongst their slaver population. While the citizens of Empkeios obtained their freedom on the basis of equal treatment and opportunities for all, it seems this has not trickled down to everyone in Empkeios. This blatant hypocrisy has been made very patent with their consolidation of the slave trade and the raise to power of the slaver guilds there.\n\nLeyan'd Lanahasha has risen as a very capable and prominent leader of the slaves' emancipation struggle, and she is now reaching for help amongst any nations willing to help in their fight. Regardless of ideology, this is an unparalleled opportunity to weaken the wicked and corrupted slave nexus of Alecand. Alternatively, we can choose to ignore them and save some coins for our own use, leaving the slaves' fate to themselves."
 empkeios_events.1303.a: "We will gladly help!"
 empkeios_events.1303.att: "This will strengthen the slaves' potential rebellion."
 empkeios_events.1303.b: "We will not get involved in a struggle that is not our own."
# The slave rebellion
 empkeios_events.1304.t: "The Slave Rebellion of [GetYear]"
 empkeios_events.1304.d: "The worst has happened. The revolt-in-the-brewing that all our cabinet has been aware of for some time now is finally here. Led by Leyan'd Lanahasha, the slaves have risen against us! Shall their reach our palace and our institutions, this will for sure be the end of our era of welfare and prosperity. We cannot let that happen!\n\n§RAttention:§! Should the rebels take our capital, the rebellion §Rwill win§! regardless of rebellion progress shown in the UI."
 empkeios_events.1304.a: "We must crush them!"
 empkeios_events.1304.att: "Note: the rebellion will be considered over when there remains no rebel armies in Empkeios."
# Slave Rebellion Victorious
 empkeios_events.1305.t: "The Slave Rebellion, Victorious!"
 empkeios_events.1305.d: "After a successful struggle with our pretentious, hypocritical overlords, the glorious Slave Rebellion of [GetYear] lead by the courageous Leyan'd Lanahasha has succeeded in overthrowing the tyrants that were ruling over Empkeios. Glory to the Revolution! And Glory to Leyan'd Lanahasha !"
 empkeios_events.1305.a: "Equal at last!"
# Slave Rebellion Defeated
 empkeios_events.1306.t: "The Slave Rebellion, Crushed!"
 empkeios_events.1306.d: "After a tumultuous period, we have managed to take back control of Empkeios. Many slaves have died, but more importantly, the surviving ones have been taught a lesson they will not forget for generations."
 empkeios_events.1306.a: "Stability, at last!"
 empkeios_events.1306.att: "Unlock new missions."

# Independent trading - Mission Event
 empkeios_events.2601.t: "On the autonomy of the Slaver Guilds"
 empkeios_events.2601.d: "The Slaver Guilds of Empkeios have, in time, become an integral part of the empkeosí economy; and the special provisions in every legal code made for them allow for a synnergy between the Guilds and the Empkeosí state. This has developed into a truly symbiotic relationship, where a balance between the state's needs and the guild's goals is consensuated. So far, this has worked wonderfully, resulting in the average free empkeosí citizen being the one who enjoys the highest standards of living in the region.\n\nWith the de facto control of the regional trade of slaves and otherwise by Empkeios, however, many voices within the Slaver Guilds are pushing for greater autonomy. This would negate some of the cash benefits from the slave production, but ultimately liberate some political power that the state is currently investing in the control and balance of the Guilds. The decision is ultimately yours, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 empkeios_events.2601.a: "I shall consider it thoroughly."
 empkeios_events.2601.att: "Granting the newly unlocked state privilege of §YSlaver Guilds: Independent Trading§! will negate the income from §GSlave§! production (just like a monopoly would); in exchange for periodic £adm£ £dip£ £mil£ bonuses equivalent to the amount of slaves produced in Empkeios. This privilege will still be available even if we form another country."

# Apikhos Volidir (debug)
 empkeios_events.3601.t: "Apikhos Volidir - DEBUG: this event should be hidden"
 empkeios_events.3601.d: "DEBUG: this event should be hidden!\n\nThis is a controller event to calculate the development of relevant allies and discount the adm/dip/mil mana accordingly."
 empkeios_events.3601.a: "Get rid of my mana, controller event!"

# Sugar from Keyolion - Keyolion
 empkeios_events.5101.t: "The Slave Trade"
 empkeios_events.5101.d: "Empkeios has approached Keyolíon with a proposition that benefits both countries. Empkeios will provide Keyolíon with a steady supply of slaves for their plantations, then Keyolíon will then export the sugar to the Kheions and split some of the profit with Empkeios."
 empkeios_events.5101.a: "Let us do this."

# Overlords Intervene - Arpedifer
 empkeios_events.5104.t: "Opportunistic Nekheis"
 empkeios_events.5104.d: "Words reach us that our subject, Empkeios, has entered into an agreement with Keyolion in which the former supplies slaves to staff Keyolioni plantations. While on paper it seems beneficial for everyone, the reality is different. The Keyolioni have carefully designed the contract such that Empkeios receives a share of the produced trade, cutting on costs by subtracting from profits and sharing the wealth between the two Nekheis, essentially bypassing taxation. This has resulted in sugarcane tariff decrease over the last three years. This is in clear violation of their duties to us as their overlord.\n\nAs early as next week we can send a messenger declaring our new legislature, heavily sanctioning this behavior and establishing transparent laws that protect our trading interests."
 empkeios_events.5104.a: "We must intervene."
 empkeios_events.5104.b: "We will let them be."
# Overlords Intervene - Empkeios
 empkeios_events.5102.t: "Trade Agreement with Keyolíon - Intervention!"
 empkeios_events.5102.d: "Terrible news today, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A delegation from our overlord has docked this very morning on the port of Empkeios. They have come to inform us that, after striking a deal with Keyolíon's overlord, key parts of the trade agreement we had with our southern brethren are to be... reinterpreted. This intervention is to take place immediatly: the delegation is not open to negotiations. Keyolíon is expected to receive the very same news soon. While parts of the deal are still in place, this is bound to severely reduce the potential benefits of the agreement."
 empkeios_events.5102.a: "Utterly unacceptable!"
# Overlodrs Intervene - Keyolion
 empkeios_events.5103.t: "The Slave Trade - Intervention!"
 empkeios_events.5103.d: "Terrible news today, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A delegation from our overlord has docked this very morning on the port of Keyolíon. They have come to inform us that, after striking a deal with Empkeios' overlord, key parts of the trade agreement we had with our northern brethren are to be... reinterpreted. This intervention is to take place immediatly: the delegation is not open to negotiations. Apparently, Empkeios has received the very same news already. While parts of the deal are still in place, this is bound to severely reduce the potential benefits of the agreement."
 empkeios_events.5103.a: "Utterly unacceptable!"

# Independence Plot - Keyolion
 empkeios_events.5201.t: "The Independence Plot"
 empkeios_events.5201.d: "The people of Empkeios, just like us, have been suffering under the rule of their overlord for too long. Our overlords intervening in our marvelous trade agreement seems to have been the last straw. They have approached us with a proposal: to fight together for our independence, against both our overlords."
 empkeios_events.5201.a: "As brothers, we shall fight together!"
 empkeios_events.5201.b: "We will fight alone."

 empkeios_events.5202.d: "The delegation we have sent to our southern brethren, Keyolíon, has just returned, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They have accepted our proposal to fight together for our independence. We shall fight together, and we shall win together!"
 empkeios_events.5202.a: "United, we will fight as one!"
 G53_empk_keyo_mission_completion_tt: "Declaring an independence war will mean also declaring war alongside §YKeyolíon§! against their overlord."
# Independence Plot - NO
 empkeios_events.5203.t: "The Independence Plot"
 empkeios_events.5203.d: "The delegation we have sent to our southern brethren, Keyolíon, has just returned, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They have rejected our proposal to fight together for our independence. We will have to fight alone; yet every preparation possible has been made. We shall win our independence!"
 empkeios_events.5203.a: "Regrardless, it is reggrettable that we will not be counting with them."

# Independence war: Success
 empkeios_events.4302.t: "Independence War - Victory!"
 empkeios_events.4302.d: "The war is over, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We have won our independence! The overlords of both Empkeios and Keyolíon have been defeated, and we are now free to pursue our own destiny. We shall not forget the help of our southern brethren in this war, and we shall not forget the help we have given them. We are now free to pursue our own destiny, make the most of every deal, and make our nation prosper. And we find ourselves in an enviable position: the market for slaves is booming, and we have the largest slave market in the region along with one of the best harbours. The future is bright for us."
 empkeios_events.4302.a: "Freedom is ours, yet some are more free than others."
# Independence war: Defeat
 empkeios_events.4303.t: "Independence War - Defeat!"
 empkeios_events.4303.d: "The war is over, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Our struggle for independence has been a failure. We were crushed by the steel boots of our overlords; and despite the help we mustered from far and wide, it simply was not enough. Countless lives were lost in this heroic battle, entire families were destroyed, and our nation has been left in ruins. We are now at the mercy of our overlords, yet again. All the citizens of Empkeios weep for the fallen, and we shall never forget their sacrifice. Rather than back to step one, we are now back to step zero. New opportunities will have to be found, new webs of alliances will have to be plotted, and new armies to fight will have to be built if we are to ever embark on the rightful journey to independence again."
 empkeios_events.4303.a: "May the fallen rest in peace. May the living never forget."

This trade route is of utmost importance for the ports of Empkeios, and we must secure it.\n\nThe current rulers of the Mteibas Valley seem to have fallen a bit behind the times, and there clearly exists an opportunity to enter into a... collaboration agreement if we manage to push things the right way. To do so, our most clever diplomats have devised a strategy where, by attatching a mercenary company to our diplomatic §YDelegation§!, there will be no need for explicit threats. The offer will be presented; yet in the terrible and unwanted case that they refuse, the Lawarund Company may take matters into its own hands."

They call themselves a §Y'Delegation'§!, with strictly diplomatic objectives, and they bear the banners of §YEmpkeios§!; yet they hardly fool anyone. The committee itself is composed by a set of diplomatic attachés, yes; but they are escorted by a whole regiment of soldiers. Our scouts have reported that this is but a part of the missive, a whole mercenary army seems to have camped just beyond the agreed border.\n\nDespite this all, the Delegation has not made any explicit threats. At least not yet. They have, however, presented a proposal to the rulers of Mteibhara: to enter into a collaboration agreement with §YEmpkeios§!. This, at first glance, seems to be a trading partnership to open the Mteibas Valley to the rest of the continent's trade. Nonetheless, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the bureaucratic jargon clearly hides dangerous implications for the sovereignty of §YMteibhara§!.\n\nWe find ourselves between a rock and a hard place. Should we refuse, it is easy to guess what steps will the mercenary army take. Should we accept, we will be giving up our sovereignty. What shall we do?"

Some, led by the example of Ameion, lean to §PIsolationism§!, closing the doors to further trade benefits for us all.\n\nIt is our duty, as hardy seamen, as traders through and thorough, as defenders of our freedom, to keep the doors open to the world. Pursuing and ensuring that §PFree Trade§! policies are followed around the continent is of utmost importance. Riches from further than the eye can see await us.\n\nWe are now in a position of strength, and the crossroads of destiny are just in front of us. The preferred opinion of our states is to make use of this newfound strength. However, we can always let every other ruler of the region chose their way without our... friendly recommendations."

Some, led by the example of Ameion, lean to §PIsolationism§!; while the rising power, Empkeios, is leading the effort for open customs and §PFree Trade§!.\n\nThe latter has now issued an ultimatum to every other nation in our region. We can either fall in line, forcing our trade policy to be aligned with theirs for the foreseeable future, or we may face the consequences of not open our borders to their traders."

The fools in [From.GetName] decided to reject our ultimatum, deciding instead to side with §PIsolationism§!.\n\nFollowing our official diplomatic line, the Dhorý diplomatic policy, the next steps are crystal clear, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We have now a unique chance to teach them a lesson and make them fall in line. Yet, as the double-edge sword of Dhorý diplomacy goes, should we decide not to act, our international reputation would plummet.\n\nThere really are only two options to carry on with our threat: we either bring them to our sphere of influence, making them a vassal of any kind; or we make sure they are not a threat to our regional interests anymore by making sure they do not hold any province in the §YDevand§!.

 G53_1_1_the_Gulf_of_Slaves_desc: "The Axehead Gulf is the prime goal of Arpedifer's colonial efforts in the Devand. As settlers arrive and the interaction with the local indigenous tribes gets more defined; the zone, and specially the northern shore, is starting to gain the informal name of the Gulf of Slaves. The port of Empkeios is slowly but surely becoming the prime controller of this commodity, widely reaping the ever-growing benefits of this ethically dubious trade."

 G53_1_2_Establishment_Slaver_Guilds_desc: "For years now, slave merchants have been a fundamental gear in empkeosí trade and economy. However, the natural chaos stemming from way-too-many small independent merchants has made the trade way more volatile, unpredictable, and ultimately less profitable than it could be. Just like with any other trade, the time has come to formalize and organize it through an official Guild. Inevitably, this will be a highly influential organization; yet if controlled successfully, the economic and political benefits it can bring are endless."
 G53_1_3_Slave_Trade_Consolidation_title: "Slave Trade Consolidation"
 G53_1_3_Slave_Trade_Consolidation_desc: "Having established dedicated guilds and now with a mercenary army to support it; it is time to consolidate our grip over production and trade of slaves. To ensure that, control must be ensured over slave-producing provinces and make them into true powerhouses."

We are now, without discussion, the go-to port for buying and selling slaves in the Devand. But we must think bigger. More markets mean more profits, and more profits mean more power. The time has come to expand our influence and control over the trade routes to the rest of the continent."
 G53_1_5_Slave_Monopoly_title: "Slave Monopoly"
 G53_1_5_Slave_Monopoly_desc: "From the main slave trade of the Devand to a near-complete monopoly, our steps have been remarkable.

 G53_2_3_Mercenary_Professionalism_desc: "The Lawarund Company, and every other mercenary group in our nation, while innovative and undoubtedly effective, still lack the professionalism and discipline of an actual army.

With people, riches, slaves, goods, and ideas flowing through its docks from as close as the Chendhya and as far as the shores of Cannor, the port of Empkeios enjoys a status of unparalleled importance."

Whoever controls the key islands of Anísoton exserts exclusive control over the passage, and the toll this imposes on everyone else's trade is gargantuan. Ensuring control over it not only secures a great source of income; but most importantly, it ensures open doors for further expansion of our trade and influence beyond the passage."
