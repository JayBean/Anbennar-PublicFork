 azkare_gather_advisors_title:0 "Gather Advisors"
 azkare_gather_advisors_desc:0 "Hiderion was born to a small family of elven farmers in Azkare 75 years ago. Ever since reaching adulthood (by human standards) he has served the Prakuong family, as both a valued advisor and personal retainer. He has risen through the ranks through dedication and skill, eventually being adopted and earning the name Hiderion Tonanzuir.\n\nHis journey from peasant to Lord inspires many in our township, and the locals are eager to show their aptitude and become advisors to Hiderion. We must gather these men and women and use them to improve our court."
 azkare_tour_the_towns_title:0 "Tour the Towns"
 azkare_tour_the_towns_desc:0 "When the people of Azkare elected Hiderion they did so based on a promise of glory and prosperity, and that is what Hiderion gave them. In 1441 he started a campaign of expansion against the neighbouring states of Lo Ngoen and Khao Elnak. The decisive blow came at the battle of Lektonmai, in which both leaders of Khao Elnak and Lo Ngoen were slain during a charge of the Shining Lancers, after which Hiderion was able to quadruple the size of Azkare.\n\nHowever, the newly conquered towns do not trust Hiderion: the fear that Jaher left behind is still strong in much of Haless, and people are wary of elves. He will personally tour the newly annexed towns, and make sure that their loyalty does not falter."
 azkare_hiderions_contemplation_title:0 "Hiderion's Contemplation"
 azkare_hiderions_contemplation_desc:0 "His name has already grown both within and outside of Azkare, but surely there is more to be done?\n\nHiderion has seen three human generations come and go in his time here, while he himself would still be considered an adolescent had he lived in Bulwar. There is so much to achieve; It is time to contemplate our ambitions and where they will take us."
 azkare_integrate_new_towns_title:0 "Integrate New Towns"
 azkare_integrate_new_towns_desc:0 "After the battle of Lektonmai in 1441, Azkare annexed many new towns. While taxes have come in steadily, they are less than we expected and not nearly enough recruits are joining our ever-growing army.\n\nWe will give them a chance to join the Shining Lancers, our prestigious core of heavy shock cavalry, a legacy of the Phoenix Legions. This both gains their loyalty as well as preparing for further expansion of Azkare."
 azkare_conquer_khao_elnak_title:0 "Conquer Khao Elnak"
 azkare_conquer_khao_elnak_desc:0 "The township of Khao Elnak is still in disarray after our victory in 1441. They elected Lady Mya Saetae to be their leader, the daughter of a strong Dauloph in Lot Dekkhang, who according to some has ties all across the continent.\n\nWe should eliminate this threat before it grows into something bigger. Not only that, Khao Elnak is home to the Sikai Purebred, the fastest breed of horse in all of Thidinkai, and a perfect addition to our Shining Lancers."
 azkare_the_lady_title:0 "The Lady"
 azkare_the_lady_desc:0 "While the township of Khao Elnak is no more, it's people are still fiercely loyal to Lady Mya Saetae, who gave everything but her life in the fight for their independence. Hiderion saw something truly great in Mya during the peace negotiations, and the lord has been increasingly absent from court..."
 azkare_towards_the_future_title:0 "Towards the Future"
 azkare_towards_the_future_desc:0 "Three years ago, on the fields near Lektonmai, the Shining Lancers earned a decisive victory with a glorious charge, and set Azkare on a new path towards a new destiny. If we want to exploit and repeat this success, we need a mighty army. The Shining Lancers must be drilled into perfection, and the units that support them expanded."
 azkare_finish_lo_ngoen_title:0 "Finish Lo Ngoen"
 azkare_finish_lo_ngoen_desc:0 "Lo Ngoen is the township to our northeast, smaller than Azkare but rich despite it. It is upstream on the Telebei, with easy access to trade from the dwarves of Verkal Ozovar and the Hinphat. The lords of Ngoen also control a significant gold mine -- all of these will be better used under Hiderion’s oversight."
 azkare_the_lord_title:0 "The Lord"
 azkare_the_lord_desc:0 "The Lord Rama Buakae was leader of Lo Ngoen until we conquered them, while most other Lords would have executed him to ensure they would not rise up in the future, Hiderion knows better. Rama will be recruited to serve as a loyal advisor of Hiderion, and will lead our armies to further conquests."
 azkare_guardian_of_the_townships_title:0 "Guardian of the Townships"
 azkare_guardian_of_the_townships_desc:0 "The first steps of Hiderion’s vision have been fulfilled. The foundations have been laid for the oncoming centuries, and greatness will be built upon them -- The townships, for the first time since Harimar, stand united under one ruler.\n\nHiderion has shown himself not to be just another warlord, but a ruler that truly cares about the wellbeing and unity of his people. Were it not for him, these townships would still have been squabbling statelets, too busy with their own conflicts to see the greater picture. Not just the Sikai, but all of Haless needs the guidance of the elves, and it is Hiderion that will enlighten them."
 azkare_visiting_an_old_friend_title:0 "Visiting an Old Friend"
 azkare_visiting_an_old_friend_desc:0 "Lord Narai Chaiya of Thirabnir grew up with Hiderion, both serving the Lord Tonan Prakuong as retainers in their youth and having kept in contact ever since and they remain as close friends. And while Hiderion’s life has only just begun, Narai’s life nears its end.\n\nWe will pay our friend one last visit, and pay our dues."
 azkare_a_shared_dream_title:0 "A Shared Dream"
 azkare_a_shared_dream_desc:0 "Narai Chaiya has two grandsons: Chaiya Kiyokat and Chaiya Sevinay. After much convincing and after some long evening talks with the brothers, they have seen the light of Hiderion’s vision, and have decided to join us in our cause. They see beyond the townships, and will assist us however they can in a new, bright future of Haless."
 azkare_the_brothers_title:0 "The Brothers"
 azkare_the_brothers_desc:0 "The Chaiya Brothers, much like their grandfather, are unequivocally skilled in their respective fields. Sevinay has become a brilliant orator, touring the countryside of our and neighbouring realms, and spreading the word of Hiderion’s vision. Kiyokat has proven to be a skilled field commander and has quickly risen through the ranks of the Shining Lancers becoming its general."
 azkare_khanvuphaim_industry_title:0 "Khanvuphaim Industry"
 azkare_khanvuphaim_industry_desc:0"Khanvuphaim is the name of a fabric made exclusively in Azkare from the feathers of a rare breed of bird found in the jungles of Thidinkai. Weaving them together without damage takes centuries to learn, but with the proper technique it becomes strong as steel yet as light as silk.\n\nThere are only a few elven masters which have mastered this craft and remain dedicated to it, yet our demand for it is much greater than the supply. We will encourage the old masters to take apprentices, and to write down their wealth of knowledge, so that future generations may continue this century old craft."
 azkare_sikai_purebreds_title:0 "Sikai Purebreds"
 azkare_sikai_purebreds_desc:0 "The Sikai Purebred is a breed of horse originating in the township of Khao Elnak, and is famed for its speed and tenacity. These steeds would be perfect for our Shining Lancers.\n\nWhile previously a closely guarded breed, with our conquest of Khao Elnak we can expand their pastures and ensure a steady stock of fresh horses to our Lancers."
 azkare_a_flourishing_economy_title:0 "A Flourishing Economy"
 azkare_a_flourishing_economy_desc:0 "While we may have successfully conquered the townships around us, they see us as a monarchical tyrant rather than the benevolent ruler that we truly are.\n\nTo ensure their loyalty and show them the truth of our ways, we need to invest into the townships' prosperity and increase the wealth of the locals, we all lift together after all."
 azkare_improve_the_citadel_title:0 "Improve the Citadel"
 azkare_improve_the_citadel_desc:0 "While Azkare once was a modern and robust fortress, it has become dated and no longer plays a key role as a border fortress that it did under the Phoenix Empire. For us, however, It remains a shining beacon of hope, and our capital should reflect our ever-expanding ambitions. Thicken the walls, erect new towers with beautiful gold-plated roofs, and expand the central keep that functions as both our court and bastion!"
 azkare_restore_our_reputation_title:0 "Restore Our Reputation"
 azkare_restore_our_reputation_desc:0 "Jaher has left a foul taste in the mouth of Haless, and it will be hard to clean the stain that he has left. Many now see the elves as ruthless invaders who do nothing but pillage and plunder, but we Sunrise Elves are a different breed. One that knows compassion, honour, and respect."
 azkare_jaerels_values_title:0 "Jaerel's Values"
 azkare_jaerels_values_desc:0 "We can not simply be conquerors of Haless, with mighty armies feared by all. Like Jaerel, we will show care for our people and ensure that they live in peace and prosperity.\n\nBy investing in the wellbeing of our subjects, we set an example of the future to come and send an important message to the rest of the continent: we are not like Jaher."
 azkare_sending_the_call_title:0 "Sending the Call"
 azkare_sending_the_call_desc:0 "The elves have been persecuted for several centuries in the majority of Haless, but now they finally have a place to call home. Already a slow trickle of elves make their way to Azkare, but that is not enough.\n\nWe will send agents all across Haless to find those elves who are lost and spread our message: Azkare is their home."
 azkare_bowmasters_of_lektonmai_title:0 "Bowmasters of Lektonmai"
 azkare_bowmasters_of_lektonmai_desc:0 "While Azkare is a haven for elves across all of Haless, for many it has become the exact thing they were trying to avoid: a place in which politics, governance and military have dominated society. The elves who shun those practices have found a place in Lektonmai.\n\nIts lush forests full of game along with a rather empty countryside has made it the perfect place for those who seek some tranquillity, and many have taken up the art of hunting and bowmanship, learned from the Xia masters to the north."
 azkare_bom_engineers_title:0 "Bom Engineers"
 azkare_bom_engineers_desc:0 "Bomdan has been a land of fortresses for longer than elves have been in Haless. This has led to the Bom people not only being expert architects of defensive structures, but also being excellent at breaching said defenses. With proper infrastructure and recruitment grounds we can make use of both of these valuable skills."
 azkare_arawkelino_elves_title:0 "Arawkelino Elves"
 azkare_arawkelino_elves_desc:0 "The elves of Arawkelin share many traits with us, and would be a valuable addition to our realm. The Kelino that dominate their realm see the value in combining the best of several cultures, and they stayed behind in Haless when all the Sun Elves abandoned Haless\n\nThrough diplomacy or war, they will join our growing state."
 azkare_arawkelino_adm_title:0 "Thidinkai Estates"
 azkare_arawkelino_adm_desc:0 "The lands of Thidinkai are vast and there is a plentitude of empty, fertile land. By making this available to the upper classes of Arawkelin, they can be enticed to join our realm. A small sacrifice for the greater good."
 azkare_arawkelino_dip_title:0 "Arawkelino Monopolies"
 azkare_arawkelino_dip_desc:0 "Arawkelin thrives as a middleman trader, sitting between Yanshen, the Raheni Gulf, and recently the arrival of ships from the West. By building a large navy and assisting them in securing the trade in these areas, their loyalty can be won over."
 azkare_arawkelino_mil_title:0 "Sharing the Burden"
 azkare_arawkelino_mil_desc:0 "Arawkelin has long sought to expand into the Lupulan Rainforest, but they are a tough and proud people. By helping them subdue the Yanglam, we can prove to them ours is a state worthy of aligning with."
 azkare_rainforest_tamed_title:0 "Rainforest Tamed"
 azkare_rainforest_tamed_desc:0 "The proud people of Yanglam still worship one of the oldest faiths in all of Haless, and this tradition must be protected. Yet currently they fight amongst themselves, and are weak to outside powers.\n\nWe will act as the guardians of the Yanglam so they will never be threatened again."
 azkare_colonize_ringlet_isles_title:0 "Our Gataw Brethren"
 azkare_colonize_ringlet_isles_desc:0 "The Gataw of the Ringlet Isles have been subject to many troubles: Their homes abandoned thanks to several waves of emigration, the remaining settlements conquered by Yan pirates, and their island shores plagued with drought and natural disaster.\n\nLike the Yanglam, they worship the spirits of old, and like the Yanglam, they too must be protected."
 azkare_contact_lesser_daulophs_title:0 "Contact Lesser Daulophs"
 azkare_contact_lesser_daulophs_desc:0 "Lot Dekkhang is dominated by a class of noble mercenary lords known as Daulophs, both lesser and greater ones. The lesser Daulophs, with the aid of coin and reason, can be convinced to join our cause, to aid us in our conquest of Lot Dekkhang."
 azkare_conquer_lapnam_amrik_title:0 "Conquer Lapnam Amrik"
 azkare_conquer_lapnam_amrik_desc:0 "Lapnam Amrik is a grand city, best known for its exalted arena in which some of the most impressive fighters battle it out for glory. It is less known for its slums and general despair.\n\nIt is our duty to take this city and turn it into a prosperous home for all."
 azkare_honour_the_dishonoured_title:0 "Honour the Dishonoured"
 azkare_honour_the_dishonoured_desc:0 "The Dishonoured are a mercenary company of exiled hobgoblins who have been banished from the Command. Yet even they deserve their place under the sun, one we shall gladly give to them."
 azkare_secure_the_telebei_title:0 "Secure the Telebei"
 azkare_secure_the_telebei_desc:0 "The rivers of Southern Haless are the highways on which all goods travel, the most important of which are the Telebei and the Teleni. The Telebei brings goods from the hold of Verkal Ozovar, passes through Azkare and Lapnam Amrik and runs by Bim Lau’s great necropolis before it empties into the Raheni Gulf. Taking it is key to maintaining our supply lines and the flow of trade."
 azkare_steward_of_the_necropolis_title:0 "Steward of the Necropolis"
 azkare_steward_of_the_necropolis_desc:0 "The Necropolis is a true wonder of Haless, and one of the largest buildings bar the high temples themselves. We will keep up the tradition of maintaining it and invest into the expansion of it, so that all who wish to be entombed here can do so."
 azkare_hermits_and_hunter_title:0 "Hermits and Hunters"
 azkare_hermits_and_hunter_desc:0 "The people along the Teleni river are known for two things: The large twelve-sided city forts of Khabtei Teleni and the Bloody Tusk monster hunters that supply the wet market of Prukhakhin. Exotic as they may be, the Biengdi will find a place in Azkare as well."
 azkare_new_dawn_porcelain_title:0 "New Dawn Porcelain"
 azkare_new_dawn_porcelain_desc:0 "The Porcelain cities on the Kharunyana have been the sole producer of their goods for centuries, and as such innovation has stagnated. Recently, a group of elven artists in Phangban have taken up the art of glazing, using a form of blue dye imported from Verkal Ozovar to create a style of Porcelain never seen before."
 azkare_shining_skirmishers_title:0 "Shining Skirmishers"
 azkare_shining_skirmishers_desc:0 "The horsemen of Sirtan are feared throughout Thidinkai as deadly raiders and masters skirmishers. They would be an excellent addition to our cavalry force, guarding the flanks of our Shining Lancers during their devastating charges."
 azkare_exploit_civil_war_title:0 "Exploit the Civil War"
 azkare_exploit_civil_war_desc:0 "The Civil War of Baihon Xinh has led to devastation, uncertainty, and chaos throughout the lands of Thidinkai. It provides us with a chance to exploit this weakness, and conquer these petty warlords to show them what true rulership is.\n\nBaihon Xinh merely used their "Empire" to ensure their existence, we will bring them the peace and prosperity they deserve."
 azkare_liberate_phonan_title:0 "Liberate the Phonan"
 azkare_liberate_phonan_desc:0 "The Phonan have been tirelessly exploited and oppressed during the rule of Baihon Xinh and its successor states. It is our duty to liberate them, to allow them to practice their faith and grant them representation in our government."
 azkare_civilize_rongbek_title:0 "Civilize the Rongbek"
 azkare_civilize_rongbek_desc:0 "The Rongbek are a traditional people, still worshipping the spirits of old in their isolated jungle communities. While we must respect and honour these traditions, they should also be part of the greater world should they wish. The people of Rongbek will finally be able to step from their jungles without fear of brutal oppression."
 azkare_dealing_with_predecessor_title:0 "Destroy Baihon Xinh"
 azkare_dealing_with_predecessor_desc:0 "Some see Baihon Xinh as the protector of Thidinkai, the one force able to beat back Jaher. We however see the truth: They were oppressors and conquerors just like the force they claim to have protected Thidinkai from. It is time to end their legacy once and for all."
 azkare_banish_pirates_title:0 "Banish the Pirates"
 azkare_banish_pirates_desc:0 "Pinghoi is a recent contender in Southern Haless, having only made the journey south from the forests of Yanshen slightly before Hiderion was elected. Along with piracy, they have brought slavery, pillaging, and brutal conquest.\n\nBut even they have traits that we can respect. Much like us, they recruit based on merit and accept anyone willing to join their ranks. They too will be assimilated, though their days of piracy are now over."
 azkare_subjugate_gon_title:0 "Subjugate the Gon"
 azkare_subjugate_gon_desc:0 "The Gon can be split into two groups. Those of the east, who were a part of the sphere of Baihon Xinh and tended to live simple lives as fishermen and farmers. And those in the west, who grow rich from sugar plantations through slave labour. This practice can and will not continue, they must be liberated."
 azkare_subdue_raiders_title:0 "Subdue the Sirtani"
 azkare_subdue_raiders_desc:0 "The Sirtani have long raided the lands surrounding the Naymak Kuwatai, and have threatened the lives of our subjects for long enough. Their experience and skills will be put towards a grander cause: That of uniting the Halessi under our benevolent rule."
 azkare_new_capital_title:0 "A Diamond in the Rough"
 azkare_new_capital_desc:0 "Sarisung, while technically the biggest city in all of Haless, is a sore sight on the eyes. To get to the center you have to cross miles of slums filled with hungry and destitute people.\n\nIt has the potential to be a shining beacon of hope for all of Haless as our capital, but it will need a lot of work to make it so."
 azkare_ready_liberators_title:0 "True Rulership"
 azkare_ready_liberators_desc:0 "The Nephrite Dwarves have brought a semblance of unity and governance to the scattered tribes of the Hinphat, but it has been through a monopoly on violence and wealth. We will show the Hinphat the ways of our great towns and parliaments, institutions built not to enrich the dwarves, but to bring fairness and prosperity to all."
 azkare_servants_no_longer_title:0 "Servants no Longer"
 azkare_servants_no_longer_desc:0 "We will bring the erstwhile vassals of Verkal Ozovar to heel under our benevolent rule. The wealth of their lands will no longer be funnelled into the mountain, and they will be granted a measure of control over their own fates which was never even dreamt of beneath the nephrite hand of the Mountain King."
 azkare_shared_ideals_title:0 "Shared Ideals"
 azkare_shared_ideals_desc:0 "While the dwarves of the Phokhao Range have a concerning weakness for all that which glitters, their perspective on rulership aligns in one way with our own: It is up to the apparatus of the state to uplift its citizens.\n\nThe lessons they learned bringing the light of civilisation to the Hinphat will be of great use to us in the coming days."
 azkare_subdue_mountain_king_title:0 "Subdue the Mountain King"
 azkare_subdue_mountain_king_desc:0 "The management of a dwarven hold is a truly daunting task. Repairs will have to be undertaken, and the hold expanded even deeper into the mountain’s roots. Let us grant our new subjects representation and autonomy over their affairs. Who, after all, knows digging better than a dwarf?"
 azkare_bokai_title:0 "Warlords No More"
 azkare_bokai_desc:0 "The warlike Bokai to our east are a hard people, well used to conquest. Their warlords and warriors are wasted in petty squabbles, let us turn them into great generals and trained soldiers, so that we might use their skill in battle to unite all of Haless under one beneficent rule."
 azkare_matriarch_of_kai_title:0 "Matriarchs of the Kai"
 azkare_matriarch_of_kai_desc:0 "The Binhrung matriarchs hold a similar view of the past to us venerable elves, their bejewelled queens from ages long gone remind them of their history, even supposedly imparting their ancient wisdom. We will show them that their own dreams of unity are not so different from ours."
 azkare_northward_gaze_title:0 "Northward Gaze"
 azkare_northward_gaze_desc:0 "The Xia have long let the affairs of the state drift into decline. Its fiefdoms are now more focused on testing the mettle of their arts against each other than beneficent rule over their citizens.\n\nThey will resist, as they resisted Jaerel before us, but once the Wulin falls it is only a matter of time before the schools of the Xia bow beneath our magnanimous hand. The Xia may hate us elves, but they will learn to love the light."
 azkare_protector_xia_title:0 "Protector of the Xia"
 azkare_protector_xia_desc:0 "The Xiaken are surprisingly resistant to our rule. Even with all the rights given to them under the concordance, they have spat upon our gifts, and preferred gloomy shadow to our brilliant light. No more!\n\nA firmer hand is required with these schools so used to struggle and war. We must complete our liberation of their lands and fortify them against any who would resist the dawning of a new, kinder era for Xia. One under our protection."
 azkare_dawn_of_a_new_era_title:0 "Dawn of a New Era"
 azkare_dawn_of_a_new_era_desc:0 "In a flurry of conquest we have liberated much of southern Haless from the hand of warlords and corrupt empires. It is time to foster the light that has begun to grow here, and turn it into a new sunrise. The brilliance of dawn will spread over all Haless, and at its head, the Sun"
 azkare_shining_lancers_title:0 "The Shining Lancers"
 azkare_shining_lancers_desc:0 "The Shining Lancers have long been the elite core of our military structure, but even in the long memories of elves, their origins as highly disciplined members of the Phoenix Legions have begun to fade.\n\nWe have supplied them with the finest horses, now we must give them the best training that can be offered by our nation’s advisors. In time, they will surpass their already glorious origins."
 azkare_expand_nakhriban_title:0 "Expand Nakhriban"
 azkare_expand_nakhriban_desc:0 "Because of that disappointing reality that we cannot field a force composed entirely of Shining Lancers, as our army expands we must shift our focus to the training of our elite infantry. Luckily, we already have the base of that infrastructure in place.\n\nIt is time to expand the Nakhriban, the martial arts academy of Azkare, adopting ever more styles from our northern neighbours. A warrior who understands his purpose is far more dangerous than any wandering master."
 azkare_school_cresting_phoenix_title:0 "School of the Cresting Phoenix"
 azkare_school_cresting_phoenix_desc:0 "The Cresting Phoenix school is the culmination of a lifetime’s work by Amareis, the greatest living elven martial artist. Its style demands and builds cooperation amongst its practitioners, and will be well-suited to our infantry. They weather attacks as one, waiting patiently for a chance at retaliation. Then, barely needing orders, striking back against the enemy in a unified, devastating assault.\n\nOur new model army will reflect our dream of a new Haless, one strong in its unity."
 azkare_thidinkai_warriors_title:0 "Kai Warriors"
 azkare_thidinkai_warriors_desc:0 "From the enduring, dwarf-armed Hinphat to the Boars of Dinh, the Kai are people used to strife, and after centuries of practice they have become quite apt at its execution. We must build the infrastructure to gather our levies from these lands, and build them into a force worthy of the liberation of Haless."
 azkare_dwarven_bombards_title:0 "Dwarven Bombards"
 azkare_dwarven_bombards_desc:0 "The dwarves, in their exodus, spread the knowledge of gunpowder across the continent, it is only natural they are its masters. The halls of Verkal Ozovar are the perfect place to manufacture a new type of artillery, one made by the hands of dwarves and potent enough to bring low the walls of even the most grand fortress."
 azkare_nephrite_platemail_title:0 "Nephrite Platemail"
 azkare_nephrite_platemail_desc:0 "Nephrite, the principle precious mineral mined in Verkal Ozovar, has been used by the dwarves for centuries as a receptacle for protective enchantments. If we sufficiently develop their hold we can clad our elites in the green and shining stone, offering them unparalleled protection in combat."
 azkare_guard_seas_title:0 "Guard the Seas"
 azkare_guard_seas_desc:0 "Now that the Arawkelin have joined us, we must fulfil our promise and protect their shores from piratical influence. It is up to us to clear the seas so that the people of the coast can live in peace."
 azkare_develop_sunharbour_title:0 "Develop the Sunharbour"
 azkare_develop_sunharbour_desc:0 "Arawkelin is known colloquially as the Sunharbour, and was first established as a base by Jaher to invade Yanshen from the seas. While it no longer houses the grand fleet of old it once used to, it is still a formidable port and a large center of trade as the center of the Ringlet Seas.\n\nWith greater investment, we can expand its capacity and have it serve as the main harbour from which we receive the Cannorian new arrivals."
 azkare_lay_foundations_title:0 "Laying Foundations"
 azkare_lay_foundations_desc:0 "Once, Jaher’s Golden Highway stretched from the fabled city of his arrival far to the west all the way to Tianlou, the jewel of the Yanshen where the campaign ended with his death. Now, it remains as only a faded scrap of its former glory.\n\nIn order to surpass the majesty of Haless’ past, we must build a new continental arterial, one for all people of the continent. Like spokes on a wheel or the rays of the sun, we will start our new highways in Xiaken, both the center of Haless and the part of our realm that most needs the watchful gaze of our military."
 azkare_expand_highway_south_title:0 "Expand the Golden Highway South"
 azkare_expand_highway_south_desc:0 "With the Xia connected like never before, we can start to spread the arteries of our state south, connecting the former capital and Citadel of the Sun in Azkare to the forests of Thidinkai and the grand port city of Cây Cam Sinh.\n\nThe new highway will serve two purposes: Ensuring the dissemination of prosperity through the southern heartlands, while also showing the people of those lands that we are far more dedicated to their governance than Jaher ever was."
 azkare_foreign_ports_title:0 "Foreign Ports"
 azkare_foreign_ports_desc:0 "The most resplendent ports in Haless have long since fallen into urban decline, their infrastructure poorly maintained by the states that have acted as their stewards. While it is true the income they bring into our coffers is significant, they are poorly run and their guilds have a proclivity for corruption.\n\nThe ports need to be renovated in order to confine the foreign merchants, so that they might never exploit the lands of Haless again."
 azkare_connect_core_highway_title:0 "Connecting the Highways"
 azkare_connect_core_highway_desc:0 "Now that our own Sunrise Highway has united our core lands, it is time we rebuilt the great work of Jaher, connecting the farthest west of our nation with its eastern bounds. It will assuredly be the work of a lifetime, but when it is complete Haless will have a unity like never before as the joy of the dawn infects every corner of the continent."
 azkare_liberate_delta_title:0 "Liberate the Delta"
 azkare_liberate_delta_desc:0 "For too long the waterways of the Kharunyana Estuary have teemed with slavers plying their foul trade up and down the Gulf of Rahen. While the meritocracy of the Bhuvauri state is admirable, they treat their people as nothing more than property.\n\nWe cannot allow this slave empire to continue. We must purge the Bhuvauri and liberate the shining jewel of Sramaya from the hands of injustice."
 azkare_ascension_pennisula_title:0 "The Ascension Peninsula"
 azkare_ascension_pennisula_desc:0 "The Ascension Peninsula is the heartland of the Harimari, the erstwhile lords of Haless and founders of many of its administrative institutions. While we have respect for the bureaucracy they founded, their system of castes is cruel, immoral, and self serving.\n\nThey ruled not for the people of Haless like we do, but for their own desires of power. It is time we show the Harimari what true equality looks like."
 azkare_gulf_coast_title:0 "Conquer the Gulf Coast"
 azkare_gulf_coast_desc:0 "The Raghamideshi of the Gulf Coast have long been at home with foreigners in their ports as their trade is plied from the gulf of Rahen all the way down the coast of Sarhal. Their expertise in shipbuilding and trade will be of great help to the empire.\n\nPerhaps more important than anything, however, is the symbolic victory we will achieve through their conquest, for in the conquest of that coast we will have taken the westernmost seas of Haless."
 azkare_upper_yanshen_title:0 "Industry of the Upper Yan"
 azkare_upper_yanshen_desc:0 "The people of the Upper Yanshen are warlike and organised in their countenance, we can use their pre-established military industry, renovating it to produce high quality goods and the high quality soldiery that comes with them."

 azkare_lower_yanshen_desc:0 "With the protection afforded by our great wall, the fields of Yanshen have been producing vast quantities of food for our empire. It is time to strengthen the defensive and agricultural infrastructure further to feed our people."
 azkare_odheongu_title:0 "Frontier Administration"
 azkare_odheongu_desc:0 "With the Odheongu region under control, we can focus on expanding the apparatus of state to include the vast expanse of steppe. The experience gained from administering to such a difficult region will serve as valuable training for our convocationaries."
 azkare_worthy_tomb_title:0 "A Worthy Tomb"
 azkare_worthy_tomb_desc:0 "Jaerel was an inspiration, his dream for a Haless united not through ruthless conquest but through cultural unity laid the foundation for all we have accomplished. It is a terrible tragedy that his passing has been so ill commemorated, and we will recitfy that as we have addressed so many of this land’s other tragedies.\n\nConsult our greatest architects, and tell them budget is not a concern: we shall give him a new tomb, one fit for the final and greatest emperor of a united Haless."
 azkare_warlordism_title:0 "Prevent Warlordism"
 azkare_warlordism_desc:0 "Even in lands we have integrated into our state there are still those who challenge our rule. Petty warlords, little better than bandit kings, who ravage the land. They steal from its people under the guise of "protection", but our people need no protection but us.\n\nWe will establish a state monopoly on minor mercenaries to deal with this burgeoning threat, while arming the peasantry, so they might fight back against any who would terrorize them. Warlordism has no place in a civilised empire."
 azkare_fenghuang_foundation_title:0 "The Fenghuang Foundation"
 azkare_fenghuang_foundation_desc:0 "Named for the near mythical bird spirit of peace and prosperity, the Fenghuang Foundation is currently but a dream in the minds of Hiderion and his advisor Dagran Krakovar. With the rise of our empire it is time to bring about their designs to rebuild Haless from the ashes of a thousand conquests.\n\nWe will bring in the finest dwarven planners and elven administrators, dedicating an entire precinct of Sarisung to the enrichment of all lands in the Sunrise Empire."
 azkare_support_small_landowners_title:0 "Support Small Landowners"
 azkare_support_small_landowners_desc:0 "As our lands have expanded, so too has the influence of certain, powerful landowning factions within the empire. In order for peace and prosperity to reach even the most rural regions of the state, it is vital their influence is curtailed.\n\nWe must take these petty rulers’ land from them, by force if necessary, and redistribute it to the local landowners under whose hand it will grow verdant."
 azkare_halessi_manufactoring_title:0 "Halessi Manufacturing"
 azkare_halessi_manufactoring_desc:0 "The industry of the cities of Haless has long been administered over by corrupt guilds and street gangs, concentrating wealth and all the benefits that lie therein into the hands of a few powerful players. By creating state run manufacturing, we can ensure the rewards of prosperity are reaped by all."
 azkare_security_against_raj_title:0 "Security Against the Raj"
 azkare_security_against_raj_desc:0 "While our campaign in Bomdan has been a remarkable success, the threat of the Raj gathers like a storm to the west. Unified or not it represents a significant power base, one we should rightly protect ourselves against\n\nBy fortifying our border with the Raj states we can both defend against their influence while making the necessary preparations for our push into the center of the subcontinent."
 azkare_unite_porcelain_cities_title:0 "Unite the Porcelain Cities"
 azkare_unite_porcelain_cities_desc:0 "One of the many secrets of Halessi wealth lies in the Porcelain Cities hung like a string of pearls from Sramaya to Sarisung. Yet in spite of all their splendour they are a shadow of what they could be.\n\nBy uniting the cities under one empire we can magnify their shining glory. They will be a brilliant, porcelain standard for what Haless can create when unified."
 azkare_center_of_the_raj_title:0 "Center of the Raj"
 azkare_center_of_the_raj_desc:0 "Now that the bulwark of the porcelain cities bristles with Jaerelic bayoneys, it is time we strike at the heart of the Raj. starting in Sramaya, we will sweep west like the coming dawn, unseating the Dhenijanraj from their opulent palaces and asserting ourselves as the true power in Rahen."
 azkare_conquer_dhujat_title:0 "Conquer Dhujat"
 azkare_conquer_dhujat_desc:0 "The Dhujat region has been caught in a crush between the Command and the Raj, the two states fighting each other to the point of annihilation for sovereignty of the land and its people. Only we, the Sunrise Empire, can usher in the age of stability and prosperity that the Raheni of Dhujat yearn for."
 azkare_unite_families_title:0 "Unite the Families"
 azkare_unite_families_desc:0 "While the complex familial relationships of the Ghankedhen will require no small amount of diplomatic navigation, their insularity and self-reliance does present us with one substantial advantage: They bear little more loyalty to their Harimar masters than they do to us. Should we prove ourselves more than equal to the Raj through the right of conquest, they will serve our state just as readily."
 azkare_the_western_walls_title:0 "The Western Walls"
 azkare_the_western_walls_desc:0 "The conquests of Jaher took Rahen by surprise. He arrived with his legions from the Salahad, driving through the passes straight into the heart of Haless. Now that we have liberated the western edges of the continent, we must ensure that such an invasion never happens again. Shore up the passes with great walls, for security breeds prosperity."
 azkare_xianjie_title:0 "Masters and Monks"
 azkare_xianjie_desc:0 "Before we unified them, the Xia were a squabbling rabble of masters, all too eager to test their might against each other, vying for power within the barely unified empire, all to the great cost of their own people. We will revitalise the region, repairing cities weary from war and repopulating devastated countryside."
 azkare_demon_hills_title:0 "The Demon Hill Mines"
 azkare_demon_hills_desc:0 "Now that the demonic Oni have been driven out and the hills are secure, we can finally begin efforts to extract the rich mineral bounties the hills have been hiding from the people of Haless. Copper, Iron, and even rich veins of gold have been prospected, we need only reinforce the great walls against the threats to the north and begin the mining."
 azkare_shamakhad_title:0 "Old and New"
 azkare_shamakhad_desc:0 "The rulership of the Command has left an indelible mark on Shamakhad, with large populations of orcs and hobgoblins permanently settled in the region. Many would consider its odd multiculturalism a detriment and while keeping racial relationships cordial will be challenging, its nature presents a unique opportunity. We will rebuild the ruin kingdoms into something far greater than what they were, a new dawn for the people of Shamakhad, one rich with hobgoblin organisation, orcish might, and human ambition."
 azkare_city_of_sun_title:0 "City of the Sun"
 azkare_city_of_sun_desc:0 "With the forging of our new empire and the repair of Sarisung, the only thing left to do in order to cement the rule of the convocation is construct a grand chamber for the parliament to meet in. Its spires will shadow even the tallest towers of the old orders, and it’s great meeting room will be filled with the voices of all Haless."
 azkare_shining_example_title:0 "A Shining Example"
 azkare_shining_example_desc:0 "It is imperative we learn from history. The war for all Haless will be won not just on the battlefield but in the hearts and minds of our people. Jaher thought he could keep the continent together through the strength of swords only; he paid for that mistake with his life.\n\nWe will ensure the continent knows that all peoples have the representation they deserve, that they might never want to leave our state."
 azkare_travelling_convocationaries_title:0 "The Travelling Convocationary"
 azkare_travelling_convocationaries_desc:0 "With the expansion of the Convocation we must ensure that the people under our rule feel that our representatives are working for their interests alone.\n\nTo this end we will send forth the travelling convocationaries, our most trusted elves who can be seen by the people to watch over those who rule them, so that they might never suffer beneath corrupt officials ever again."
 azkare_elven_ambassadors_title:0 "Elven Ambassadors"
 azkare_elven_ambassadors_desc:0 "While in Haless even the mention of elves brings forth bitter memories of Jaher’s conquest, since reaching out into the world beyond we have been reminded of the good name of elves in Bulwar and beyond. There, elven diplomats are treated with honour, not the fear and disdain they receive in Haless. It is time we repair the reputation of our race, that the other nations of our continent will treat us with the respect we deserve."
 azkare_foreign_embassies_title:0 "Sunrise Embassies"
 azkare_foreign_embassies_desc:0 "Rumours have been spreading into the world beyond Haless’ spirits and lordly tigers. They tell of a new power rising in the east, one forged from the common desires of all peoples: Peace, prosperity, and security. It is time for the Sunrise Empire to enter the world stage. We will construct grand embassies in Halann’s most important cities, the jewels in the world’s crown, that all might bask in the grace of the dawn."
 azkare_beacons_of_haless_title:0 "Beacons of Haless"
 azkare_beacons_of_haless_desc:0 "Sramaya, Tianlou, and Sarisung. The greatest cities in Haless, but for our purposes they need to be more than cities. We must make them beacons, monuments to what a united people, empowered through the singular purpose of achieving a Halessi utopia. We will light a fire in the hearts of Haless, making each of the three metropolises greater than any ever seen before."
 azkare_radiant_campaigns_title:0 "Radiant Campaigns"
 azkare_radiant_campaigns_desc:0 "While our ambitions are mighty, we have yet to reach the degree of military might needed to contend with some of the continent’s old powers. For us to reach towards our dream of a unified Haless, we must begin by creating an army capable of wrestling with the continent’s mightiest states."
 azkare_security_against_command_title:0 "Security Against the Command"
 azkare_security_against_command_desc:0 "In order to ensure that the Command pushes no further south into the lands of the Xia, we must not fall into the same complacent attitude of poor defense that spelled ruin for the Upper Raheni. While the Harimari of Fengzhaobu have made a valiant effort defending the border thus far, it is time for our architects to move into the region with plans to fortify the pass from Tughayasa all the way to the Demon Hills."
 azkare_eradicate_vampires_title:0 "Eradicate the Vampires"
 azkare_eradicate_vampires_desc:0 "Foul sorcery abounds in the southern demon hills, mortal men dabbling in the demonic powers of the Oni. Through their wicked magics they have gained immortality and undeath at the cost of their own people’s life force. It is time we bring to them what these pitiful creatures fear most, the scouring light of the inexorable dawn."
 azkare_defeat_our_demons_title:0 "Defeat our Demons"
 azkare_defeat_our_demons_desc:0 "There is a shadow that lies to the north of civilised Haless, the terrible Oni, half demon half man-eating beast. Their black magics mar the countenance of the sun. For us to let them live would be an injustice to all free people of Haless. We must obliterate them utterly, and take back the Demon Hills for the light of the dawn.."
 azkare_repopulate_the_hills_title:0 "Repopulate the Hills"
 azkare_repopulate_the_hills_desc:0 "While the Demon Hills are nominally under our control, fell Oni still lurk among it’s high peaks and shadowed valleys. To make sure our continent is forever purged of their darkness, we must fill the hills with our own people, and send the Oni to meet their Giant masters."
 azkare_rebuild_the_ruins_title:0 "Rebuild the Ruins"
 azkare_rebuild_the_ruins_desc:0 "When the Command came pouring out of Grônstunad, they cut a swathe through much of Shamakhad, adding many new ruins to the centuries of stratified civilisation. As the region falls beneath our beneficent hand, we will ensure their many derelict kingdoms are restored to their old glory, while adding our own shining mark."
 azkare_guardians_of_all_haless_title:0 "Guardians of All Haless"
 azkare_guardians_of_all_haless_desc:0 "To take the mantle of Haless’s true heir and guardian, we must curtail the influence of foreigners in our lands. They threaten to steal the wealth from our people’s hands, replacing it with their strange customs. This we cannot allow. We will secure the Halessi coastline, and allow no foreign trader into our ports without strict regulation; only then will Haless be safe."
 azkare_cities_of_haless_title:0 "Cities of Haless"
 azkare_cities_of_haless_desc:0 "The true light of Haless has always lain in its cities. Each of them is rich in history, culture, and wealth. Yet beneath the rule of so many tyrants, warlords, and petty kings, their lustre has grown dull. To restore their shining glory we will need to uplift each and every one of them, as we uplifted Sarisung and Sramaya from their depredations. Haless’ cities will stand as an eternal testament to the beauty that can be achieved through unity."
 azkare_nur_yemenar_title:0 "Nur Yemenar"
 azkare_nur_yemenar_desc:0 "After many long years of struggle, political navigation, and bloodshed, the people of Haless are one. And although they remain distinct from one another in culture, language, and even species, they are united through the singular dream of paradise. The dream of Jaerel, and of Hiderion, has been achieved, and Haless stands proudly at its apotheosis, the pinnacle of all civilised races."
 azkare_monks_of_weaving_palm_title:0 "Monks of the Weaving Palm"
 azkare_monks_of_weaving_palm_desc:0 "At Tianlou, a handful of our sun elven kin have banded together as the Monks of the Weaving Palm, named after a new style of magic. Rather than casting with reagents or rituals, they use simple body movements to alter ‘the weave,’ or the fundamental force of magic itself. By sponsoring this order, we would gain immense benefits. In return, members will pledge their service as war wizards and advisors, as well as teach their techniques throughout Haless, allowing us to unify our nation’s martial and magical disciplines."
 azkare_high_dawn_academy_title:0 "The High Dawn Academy"
 azkare_high_dawn_academy_desc:0 "The burden of a ruler is one of constant learning. Over the long life of an elf, the world can change drastically, and we cannot allow our leaders to be left behind. To that end we will establish an institute, one run by the most prestigious of retired convocationaries, that our leaders might grow and change with the growing and changing demands of the empire."
 azkare_crepuscular_institute_title:0 "The Crepuscular Institute"
 azkare_crepuscular_institute_desc:0 "With the integration of so many new methods of war into our armies, unified tactics and strategies have become increasingly difficult to maintain. More and more generals and their officers have been returning to what they know. To combat this issue we will establish a military academy in the heart of the empire, where all officers of all races can be trained to utilise each other's strengths, and fill in any gaps of weakness. Through unity, comes power."
 azkare_rotating_garrisons_title:0 "Rotating Garrisons"
 azkare_rotating_garrisons_desc:0 "Our subjects, both current and future, must be able to trust the armies of our empire not just to protect the cohesion of the state, but also to serve as their guardians. In turn, we must ensure that our soldiers fight not just for their village or their city, but for all Haless. To that end, a system of garrisons will be instituted to ensure that each soldier sees every corner of the empire in their duties, so they understand exactly what they are fighting for. This will simultaneously show all our citizens that, despite vast gulfs of differences, any soldier of the Sunrise Empire would make for them the ultimate sacrifice."
 azkare_convocationary_guard_title:0 "Convocationary Guard"
 azkare_convocationary_guard_desc:0 "Made up of our army’s most elite troops, the new Convocationary Guard will serve three purposes. Primarily, they will guard the Convocation in Sarisung, ensuring that the centre of our empire never falls to a threat. They will also be personally assigned to guard the travelling convocationaries in their long deployments away from home. Finally, in times of strife, they can be rallied to serve as an elite fighting unit, protecting our democracy in a more active fashion."
 azkare_breakthrough_into_yanshen_title:0 "Breakthrough into Yanshen"
 azkare_breakthrough_into_yanshen_desc:0 "There are few more hostile to elvenkind than the Xia, but as we move into Yanshen their enmity for us is blistering. For us to conduct a campaign against such ruthless resistance we will need a foothold in the region, a base of operations to expand and reclaim the Yanshen."
 azkare_free_the_shamadhan_title:0 "Free the Shamadhan"
 azkare_free_the_shamadhan_desc:0 "The Shamadhan city of Sir was the last to fall in the Command’s great conquest of upper Rahen, and to liberate them from the iron grip of the hobgoblins would be a powerful message. We will let the rest of the Raheni know that the days of the Command are numbered, and for those labouring under its subjugation, a new dawn is approaching."
 azkare_source_of_the_yan_title:0 "Source of the Yan"
 azkare_source_of_the_yan_desc:0 "With Shamadhan freed, we can continue our march up the Yan river towards the Command’s capital in the heartland of Shamakhad. With every step our soldiers take into the occupied territory, the hobgoblin menace is pushed further and further back into the Jade Mines."
 azkare_destroy_the_command_title:0 "Destroy the Command"
 azkare_destroy_the_command_desc:0 "The hobgoblin capital has fallen and their land is cleft in two, our armies stand poised on the brink of a final push into their homeland in the foothills of the Jade Mountains. One last strike is all that it will take to finally end the threat of tyranny and subjugation that has been haunting northern Haless and Rahen for centuries."
 azkare_integrate_hobgoblins_title:0 "Integrate the Hobgoblins"
 azkare_integrate_hobgoblins_desc:0 "With the Collapse of their Great Command, we must decide the fate of the hobgoblins in our lands. While there are many rightfully upset upper Raheni calling for their expulsion into the mountains, the Convocation cannot help but admire them. The hobgoblins are undeniably hardy and loyal, their ironbound discipline allowing them to sweep aside the Ruin Kingdoms of old. There is no doubt that they would be of great merit in our armies and as citizens in our empire; the only question that remains is how to go about integrating them…"
 azkare_great_wall_of_yanshen_title:0 "The Great Wall of Yanshen"
 azkare_great_wall_of_yanshen_desc:0 "There are many threats to the north of the Yan and the Demon Hills. The bird riding nomads, the face stealing demons - reports have even reached us of warlike, horse-legged men to the far north. These are not threats we can go forth and destroy, for sending armies into those barren wastes could only lead to military disaster. Thus, our greatest dwarven architects have drawn up a plan to wall off the threats with a series of fortifications that span from the eastern mouth of the Jade Mines to the northernmost reaches of Yanshen, ensuring peace and security in the region for all time."
 azkare_thidinkai_title:0 "Warriors and Horses"
 azkare_thidinkai_desc:0 "Everyone in Haless knows that the best horses come from Thidinkai, and while the Shining Lancers of old have long since been phased out of our military, the desire for quality steeds has only increased. By reforming and militarising the production of Sikai Purebreds, we can create a steady supply of the finest horses, and the finest men and women to ride them."
 azkare_bomdan_title:0 "Spirits and Artisans"
 azkare_bomdan_desc:0 "There is a long history in Bomdan of using spirits as guards; the Great Necropolis of Bim Lau, for example, has long been patrolled by restless ghosts. By encouraging this tradition through regimented production of offerings, we can expand this tradition, securing Bomdan against any threat, natural or supernatural."
 azkare_lupulan_rainforest_title:0 "Sailors and Shipbuilding"
 azkare_lupulan_rainforest_desc:0 "The Lupulan rainforest is an untapped resource. In its bountiful stores are vast troves of valuable wood we can use for all our naval needs. Not only that, but its position next to the finest sailors in our land, the former pirates of Pinghoi, means that with some upgrades to the region’s infrastructure, we can turn the southern cape of Haless into our principal naval region."
 azkare_jaerelic_legion_title:0 "Organise the Jaerelic Legions"
 azkare_jaerelic_legion_desc:0 "As we integrate more nations into our great state, we have noticed the legions becoming ever more diverse. Some would see our armies as a disorganised rabble of disparate cultures, but we can use each for their unique strengths. Highly trained Yan infantry, Harimari shock troops, Kai lancers. From our diversity can come unparalleled strength, and it is high time we organised the legions to reap these many rewards."

 azkare_saamdach_system_title:0 "The Saamdach System"
 azkare_saamdach_system_desc:0 "Adapted from the Saamdach system of the Biengdi, we will implement a categorical method of ranking our cities based on their economic and social performances in various categories. This will allow us to more effectively target the areas in which they need growth, while also encouraging a healthy degree of competition to improve. Not only that, but the presence of imperial assessors will allow us to better manage and observe the goings on in the more autonomous regions of the empire."
 azkare_forest_yan_title:0 "The Zyuhunjip Jungle"
 azkare_forest_yan_desc:0 "Replete with silk and the largest tea crops in Haless, the Zyuhunjip jungle and its people have been notoriously unconquerable, resisting both attempts of Harimar and Jaher. While the jungle presents great dangers, it must inevitably be conquered on our path to unification."
 azkare_down_the_coast_title:0 "Down the Coast"
 azkare_down_the_coast_desc:0 "As we push into Yanshen, the ancient city of Tianlou beckons. It was there that Jaerel’s rule was cut short, and there that the Phoenix Empire began its ultimate collapse in Haless. By retaking the coastline, and eventually the city itself, we can prove ourselves more than the equal of all the rulers that have come before us."
 azkare_northern_yanshen_title:0 "The Border Yan"
 azkare_northern_yanshen_desc:0 "Harried by the wild bird riders of the steppe, the northern Yan are a hard people, well used to conflict. Conquering them will be difficult but worth the trial, their long and violent history giving them great value as soldiers and guardsmen."
 azkare_steward_of_the_yan_title:0 "Steward of the Yan"
 azkare_steward_of_the_yan_desc:0 "Long have the Yan resisted foreign occupation; but we are not foreign occupiers. We are Halessi, just as they are, a fact we must demonstrate to them irrefutably. Heal the land of Yanshen, provide it with wealth and security, and its people will finally realise that we do not rule to be served, but to serve."
 azkare_isolated_not_forgotten_title:0 "Isolated but not Forgotten"
 azkare_isolated_not_forgotten_desc:0 "The far Odheongun, separated from Haless by a hostile sea of steppe, are Halessi nonetheless. It is up to us to protect them from the threats that encroach upon them from all sides, be it facestealers, marauding bird-riders, brutal centaurs, or greedy Cannorians. The Odheongun will finally know peace."
 azkare_rahen_coast_title:0 "Philosophers and Traders"
 azkare_rahen_coast_desc:0 "Since the Harimar Ascension, the Rahen coast has been the centre of philosophical thought in Rahen, with the great schools of High Philosophy all dedicated to solving the questions of state and rulership. These pursuits are aided by active trade in the region bringing in a flow of new ideas from across the continent. By opening new marketplaces and new universities, we will foster the flame of thought that lies in the heart of Rahen."
 azkare_dhujat_title:0 "Elephants and Fortresses"
 azkare_dhujat_desc:0 "The elephant kings of Dhujat have long used the great beasts to build their grand palaces. By instituting a more organised breeding program in the region, we can not only improve Dhujat’s existing fortifications, but proliferate their elephant-based building methods across the empire."
 azkare_rakhadesh_title:0 "Shepherds and Soldiers"
 azkare_rakhadesh_desc:0 "The people of Rakhadesh have long been insular. Wrapped around the barren Marutha, they have become a hardy folk, greatly focused on family and loyalty. Because of this, they have been historically resistant to recruitment. By ensuring more sustainable agriculture in the region, we can begin to take these desert hardened men and women and fashion them into fine soldiers, while also increasing the region’s output of goats and sheep."

 azkare.1.t:0 "Citadel of the Dawn"
 azkare.1.d:0 "The Citadel of the Dawn is a fortress that was built in the days of the Phoenix Empire, which, under Jaher, spanned from the coasts of the Divenhal to the grand city of Tianlou, where he was assassinated in 1136 due to his mismanagement of his diverse Halessi subjects. His son, Jaerel, attempted to keep the empire together, not just with force like Jaher but by trying to unite the Halessi and integrate into their culture, even marrying a Harimari princess. Yet he too was tragically assassinated, after which most of the legionnaires fought their way through Haless to retreat back to Bulwar.\n\nSome elves however, came to like their life in Haless and tried to stay, but Jaher’s occupation bred hatred, and the elves were slaughtered in droves. The Citadel of the Dawn is one of few places in which elves could survive this fury, and hosts the biggest elven community in all of Haless, its thick walls and corps of heavily armoured Shining Lancers allowing these Elves to escape the wrath of the locals.\n\nLater on, the elves of the Citadel of the Dawn joined the nearby townships, a collection of small autonomous collectives united against outside foes. It is in this environment that Hiderion Tonanzuir grew up, in a mixed community of Sunrise Elves and Sikai people. He saw something great in that cooperation, especially when a local noble by the name of Tonan Prakuong adopted the young elf into his household, where Hiderion served the family for several human generations as an advisor and personal retainer to the Lord. For his services, he was elected Lord of the townships in 1438.\n\nAmbitious as he was, he immediately set to work on expanding his township, leading to the battle of Lektonmai in 1441, in which the townships of Khao Elnak and Lo Ngoen were dealt a heavy defeat by the Shining Lancers, and Azkare was expanded dramatically. In the last 3 years, Hiderion has been spending his time..."
 azkare.1.a:0 "...expanding the bureaucracy and efficiency of the court."
 azkare.1.b:0 "...Wooing the mayors of the towns under his reign."
 azkare.1.c:0 "...Ensuring that the Shining Lancers and his other military units were at their best."

 azkare.2.d:0 "Ah shit all the elves in Azkare are dead too bad you lose the free accepted culture slot now nerd"
 azkare.2.a:0 "Good, they sucked"

 azkare.3.t:0 "An Elven Advisor Arrives at Court."
 azkare.3.d:0 "We have sent out messengers both within our own lands and across the continent to seek out elven blooded advisors for our court. Of the options they return to us with, we choose…"
 azkare.3.a:0 "...the Administrator"
 azkare.3.b:0 "...the Diplomat"
 azkare.3.c:0 "...the Retired General"

 azkare.5.t:0 "Sons of Azkare"
 azkare.5.d:0 "It has long been the tradition of the lord to pick his advisors from the sons of the landed nobility in his realm, but that antiquated system is both unfair, and detrimental to the apparatus of the state. After all, wasn’t Hiderion himself a mere elven peasant when Tonan first saw his potential? We will uplift the peasantry, and place those brilliant enough to serve in positions of authority in our court."
 azkare.5.a:0 "Focus on skilled bureaucrats recruited from the lower classes."
 azkare.5.b:0 "Promote local diplomats to represent their people’s interests in court."
 azkare.5.c:0 "Commission new officers from the sharpest enlisted men."

 azkare.6.t:0 "Touring the New Towns"
 azkare.6.d:0 "The sound of snapping pennants and the soft slush of hooves on a muddy road herald the arrival of Hiderion and his honour guard of Shining Lancers into the town of Vai Ma at the edge of the Khao Elnak border. All around him he sees the signs of the recent war.\n\nBurned houses still sit abandoned at the edge of the settlement while many fields lie fallow and overgrown with weeds. The sullen eyes of conquered peoples are all that greet him on his ride into town, even the local council is absent.\n\nThe people here are not living under the glory and prosperity promised by Azkare, they are simply surviving. It is time to change that."
 azkare.6.a:0 "Send skilled administrators to organise the repair effort of the border towns."
 azkare.6.b:0 "Personally see to the distribution of alms for those affected by war."
 azkare.6.c:0 "Garrison additional watchmen to shield against banditry and looting."

 azkare.7.t:0 "Hiderion's Contemplation"
 azkare.7.d:0 "There is a chill fog over the Citadel of the Dawn in the dark hours before sunrise. Hiderion has left his most capable advisors in charge while he readies his horse for the narrow road to the deep north and places rich in wisdom. He shoulders his pack, draws his cloak, and sets out shrouded.\n\nIn the weeks that follow he sees the many wonders of Xia and the Upper Yanshen. He crosses the river bridge into the Liusibao, from which an empire of squabbling masters is managed. He walks the lines of the many mustering fields of Bianfang, where ironhard discipline is instilled into the Yanshe peasantry. Hiderion even makes the journey up Mount Tughayasa to where the oracles see across all Haless, all the twisting bonds and connections that link the ancient continent.\n\nOf all the places he has seen, one sticks in his mind as he meditates in the garden upon his return."
 azkare.7.a:0 "The Liusibao, center of the Xia"
 azkare.7.b:0 "The monastery of the Oracular Order atop Mount Tughayasa"
 azkare.7.c:0 "The growing military might of Bianfang"

 azkare.8.t:0 "New Recruits"
 azkare.8.d:0 "We have sent our sergeants into the countryside to gather recruits to our banners. They ride into villages clad in brilliant plate and chain, speaking of glory and the good of Haless to the forlorn youths of Azkares new towns. Their recruitment drive has been a success, bringing many new bodies into the ranks of the Shining Lancers."
 azkare.8.a:0 "These new recruits will be a shining example to the rest of the townships."

 azkare.9.t:0 "The Lady Mya Saetae"
 azkare.9.d:0 "It has been several months since the official surrender of Khao Elnak and, after many requests, the Lady Mya Saetae has finally deigned to grace the Citadel of Dawn and Hiderion’s court with her presence. The elven lord receives her in his gardens. All is quiet, barring the soft stride of Mya as she approaches Hiderion, his eyes shut, clearly in deep meditation. For a moment her thoughts go to the dagger concealed against her thigh. One dishonourable slash and her people might be free… The thought dissipates into the perfume of the flowers as the elf opens his eyes. Hiderion Tonanzuir stands from his spot on the grass and gives a deep bow. "Lady Saetae, you honour me with your radiance."\n\n"Lord Tonanzuir, the warmth of your… did we not have enough of this formality at the negotiations? Why am I here, Hiderion?". The Elf does not reply, the slight smile ever present on his lips broadening. "Won’t you walk with me, Lady Saetae? The gardens are one of my few distractions."\n\nMya falls into step beside the lord as he leads them through one of the garden’s many paths. The blossoms bleed their deep redolence across the path. "People have called me a conqueror, they tell me the violent blood of Jaher flows in my veins. But you must understand war is not something I cherish."\n\n"I do not think that the men and women whose blood watered the ground that your war might grow care much about whether you delight in their bloodshed or not." The words fall from her mouth with the desired impact as Hiderion’s eyes grow sorrowful. "I go to war so that their children, and all their descendants might one day live without fear. The world is a harsh place, and we are so locked in its cycles of brutality that we forget to dream of a brighter future."\n\n"It is a harsh place, my Lord and it is…" She gestures vaguely at the elf. "People like you who make it that way. You brought pain to my lands and now do me the indignity of speaking of the greater good?" Hiderion stops in his tracks, and for a moment Mya thinks she has gone too far. Instead of shouting, he sighs. "The lives of men have been given for much less. I do not compel those who fight for me to do so. They are willing in their enduring sacrifice. War will come to us, across the continent a hundred rulers far worse than I stir to the clarion of conquest. All I want, all I have ever wanted is to still that call and bring the people of this continent together. I dare to dream that one day we might have an eternal peace, the bounties of which all may share, equal under the light of dawn."\n\nThe words resonate within Mya, and she finds herself unable to muster a retort. "I…I will think on this."\nHiderion smiles that odd, beneficent smile. "Perhaps you will join me for another walk tomorrow? I have many dreams, my Lady.""
 azkare.9.a:0 "Lady Mya Saetae Joins Azkare, along with her personal retinue and treasury"

 azkare.10.t:0 "The Lord Rama Buakae"
 azkare.10.d:0 "A torrent of whispers fill the courtroom as the former lord of Lo Ngoen is led to the throne of Hiderion, flanked by two Shining Lancers. There has been much speculation of the lord’s fate. Hiderion is known for his mercy, but Rama Buakae is a dangerous man to leave alive. His skill on the battlefield as a warrior and a general is renowned, and he could easily inspire his people into rebellion.\n\nRama ignores their whispering. He is ready to face whatever fate lay before him with the same steely eyed countenance that he faced every challenge so far. Of his own volition he kneels before Hiderion and presents the elf with his sword hilt first, with the tip pointed towards his own heart. Hiderion moves towards him, delicately taking the blade, then casting it aside on the stones. "Your journey does not end here, lord Buakae."\n\nHe grasps the broad man by an arm and lifts him to his feet.\n\nLater, they stand on the wall of the citadel, overlooking the grounds where the Shining Lancers train. "So you want me to train them, Hiderion?"\n\nThe elf nods. "Not just train, but expand. They are skilled now, but they are not a legion. I need you to take these warriors and make them into soldiers."\n\nRama considers this for a moment. "I can do that, but I need something from you."\n\n"Yes?"\n\n"Keep my people safe.""
 azkare.10.a:0 "Lord Rama Buakae joins Azkare, in return for autonomy of his people"

 azkare.11.t:0 "Further Ambitions"
 azkare.11.d:0 "The Kai townships finally know a unity not felt since the conquests of Jaher. The disparate towns are united under the watchful gaze of Hiderion’s administration. For the purposes of fair governance over the fiercely independent Kai, we have established the convocation: a parliament, of sorts, centered in Azkare and designed for the express purpose of equal governance of all who dwell in our lands.\n\nThe dream of Jaerel is not dead as many thought, but exists as a growing flame blossoming in the heart of our glorious state."
 azkare.11.a:0 "Focus on the creation of a superior Apparatus of State."
 azkare.11.b:0 "Reach out to the subjugated peoples around us, that all may know the light of dawn."
 azkare.11.c:0 "Hone our military might, that we may free the people of Haless."

 azkare.12.t:0 "The Death of Lord Narai Chaiya"
 azkare.12.d:0 "event for thirabnir that should talk about Hiderion’s and Lord Narai’s relationship as retainers in Azkare and how they shared some ideas"
 azkare.12.a:0 "We will honour our grandfathers wishes"
 azkare.12.b:0 "We will not join Hiderion"

 azkare.13.t:0 "Kiyokat Joins Azkare"
 azkare.13.d:0 "Kiyokat, grandson of the old Lord Narai, has decided to throw his lot in with Hiderion. In a grand ceremony in court, he pledged the allegiance of Thirbanir and its people to Azkare, binding the futures of the two nations together for the rest of time."
 azkare.13.a:0 "A welcome addition to our court"

 azkare.14.t:0 "Chaiya Rejects Our Offer"
 azkare.14.d:0 "Chaiya, grandson of the old Lord Narai, has decided to dishonour his grandfather’s wishes and take Thirabnir on its own path. Such shortsightedness is a surprise from the grandchild of one of Hiderion’s oldest friends, but we are assured that Thirabnir will welcome the light, eventually."
 azkare.14.a:0 "Chaiya does not understand the bigger picture. Yet."

 azkare.15.t:0 "Gathering the Lost"
 azkare.15.d:0 "The scars of the Phoenix Empire’s fall can still be seen upon the lands of Haless, ruined forts, old battlefields long rusted over, but nowhere is it more evident than upon the dour faces of the sunrise elves across the continent. Everywhere they still bear the burden of the conqueror’s sin.\n\nIn a marketplace in Sarisung, a weary elven merchant’s goods are confiscated by corrupt guards. They trudge home, resigned to live their long life penniless, as the other traders turn a blind eye.\n\nIn a village in far Yanshen a child goes missing, likely the work of a marauding spirit. All eyes turn to the elven herbalist who lives at the edge of the forest, the one who has made cures for the villagers’ parents, their grandparents. By the evening of the next day they are but a charred and shrivelled thing amidst the smoking ruins of their house.\n\nIn the palace of a decadent Harimari raja, elves bought from slave markets are kept as entertainment, to sing and serve plates of spiced meats. As their golden voices alight in the throne room, their cheeks are wet with tears.\n\nNo more. We will not allow our people to suffer for crimes committed centuries ago. Sound the call, gather them together, the lost elves, those abandoned in the empire’s hasty retreat. They will always have a home here, working in our parliament, our army, and using their knowledge of the continent to ensure such injustices are wiped out."
 azkare.15.a:0 "Recruit them for the convocation."
 azkare.15.b:0 "Use their knowledge of far lands."
 azkare.15.c:0 "Make them soldiers and leaders in the war against oppression."

 azkare.16.t:0 "The Brothers Chaiya"
 azkare.16.d:0 "Now that Thirabnir has been officially integrated into Azkare, Hiderion has called the twin brothers Chaiya, the sons of Narai, Kiyokat and Sevinay, to speak with him of their place within the court. \n\n"I have greatly admired your ministrations over Thirabnir in this transition period, you will always have a home and a place amongst my most trusted supporter-" \nHiderion is cut short as the brash young Kiyokat interrupts him "I have grown tired of leading wallowing around courts and embassies. Place me in charge of the Shining Lancers." \nThe elf raises his eyebrows and opens his mouth to speak, again being cut off. This time by Sevinay. "And you need someone to write down all those laws you keep decreeing. Someone you trust." \n"Well. I suppose that is that." Hiderion pulls a bottle of something delightfully exotic from beneath his desk. "To the future.""
 azkare.16.a:0 "To the future."

 azkare.17.t:0 "The Elves of Lektonmai"
 azkare.17.d:0 "Not all Sunrise Elves are suited for the stuffy courts and endless maneuvering of governance. Some long for the feeling of wind rushing through their hair as they ride swift steeds bareback through fields, or the taut sinew of a bowstring pressing against their fingertips. To these wild folk we will give Lektonmai, where they might hone their natural swiftness and the sharpness of their eyes into a tool that will serve Azkare."
 azkare.17.a:0 "Perfection truly takes centuries of experience"

 azkare.18.t:0 "Closing the Market"
 azkare.18.d:0 "The wetmarkets of Prukakhin are economically unsustainable and unsanitary. They are a relic of Bomdan’s more bloody and brutal past, trading in slaves and beasts from far flung corners of the continent. We must purge it from the city to bring the shining light of civilisation to the people of Bomdan."
 azkare.18.a:0 "Let us hope they learn to accept it"

 azkare.19.t:0 "Direction of the Daulophs"
 azkare.19.d:0 "The Daulophs have long brought prosperity to the lands of Lot Dekkhang through their venture mercenary companies. We predict they could bring similar wealth and skilled soldiers under our rule, but that plan has drawbacks and many in our nation argue that we cannot simply have mercenary rabbles with significant power in the affairs of the state roaming our lands."
 azkare.19.a:0 "Allow them their private armies to rent across the continent."
 azkare.19.b:0 "Bring them in line with the rest of our nobility."

 azkare.20.t:0 "Finorian Urionzuir"
 azkare.20.d:0 "As elves grow old, many begin to develop strange, if minor, eccentricities, but Finorian Urionzuir is stranger than most. Ill content with fighting the men of Haless, he honed his skills against the many spirits that inhabit the continent. He proved his worth during Jaher’s siege of Bim Lau, drawing out the proud spectres that guard its walls into single combat and shortening the siege significantly. Unfortunately the wounds he suffered in his many duels were themselves spiritual in nature, leaving ghastly scars on his soul that prevent him from straying too far from the city.\n\nNow we have taken back the city, we will recruit this forlorn warrior. His days of bloodshed are over, but the struggle continues."
 azkare.20.a:0 "A welcome addition to our court"

 azkare.21.t:0 "Renewed Market"
 azkare.21.d:0 "We have closed and cleaned the markets of Prukhakhin, ending the trading of slaves and exotic creatures, but we cannot simply leave a hole in the economy for smugglers and black market privateers to move in. So the question remains, what to replace the ivory trade with?"
 azkare.21.a:0 "Paper"
 azkare.21.b:0 " A Nephrite Dwarf gem quarter"
 azkare.21.c:0 "Cloth"

 azkare.22.t:0 "Our Southern Brothers"
 azkare.22.d:0 "The port city of Arawkelin was established by Jaher himself as a staging area for the phoenix legions and it still houses one of the largest populations of elves and half elves on the continent. If we can move with diplomatic alacrity, we may be able to integrate this state without too much bloodshed. Our advisors have laid out three options for us.\n\nBy guaranteeing the half-elven Martao Princes vast estates in the heart of our lands, we can keep them close to home, and more smoothly transition them into our administration.\n\nBy granting their plutocratic Yan Martao Princes exclusive trade rights up and down the coast of the Lupulan Peninsula, we can bring their state closer to ours, enveloping it in security and prosperity.\n\nThe rainforest peoples of the Yanglam have long troubled Arawkelin, their isolationism and brutal guerilla tactics inflicting heavy losses on any who attempt to civilise the jungle, stymying Jaher himself. We will show the elves of the south that ours is a military capable of bringing light and liberation to even the darkest places on the continent, one way or another."
 azkare.22.a:0 "Give them large estates in Thidinkai"
 azkare.22.b:0 "Give them trade privileges"
 azkare.22.c:0 "Help them subdue the Yanglam"

 azkare.23.t:0 "An Offer From Azkare"
 azkare.23.d:0 "The elves of Azkare have come to us with a bold request: Join them as their vassals, and they will give our nobility vast tracts of land in their own territory. It is a bold one, to be sure, but tempting."
 azkare.23.a:0 "Yes please!"
 azkare.23.b:0 "The audacity!"

 azkare.24.t:0 "An Offer From Azkare"
 azkare.24.d:0 "The crafty Azkare elves are giving us the chance to sell our very freedom for gold, offering exclusive trade rights up and down the peninsula. Should we accept we will be their vassals… but it is rather a lot of trade."
 azkare.24.a:0 "Yes please!"
 azkare.24.b:0 "The audacity!"

 azkare.25.t:0 "An Offer From Azkare"
 azkare.25.d:0 "In exchange for subjugation, the lord of Azkare has offered military help with our old enemy, the rainforest people of Yanglam. While it is true they have long plagued our border, is it worth surrendering our freedom for?"
 azkare.25.a:0 "Yes please!"
 azkare.25.b:0 "The audacity!"

 azkare.26.t:0 "Arawkelin Declines!"
 azkare.26.d:0 "The foolish half elves of Arawkelin have rejected our gracious offer. If we cannot treat with them diplomatically, we will have to bring the dawn to their lands by force of arms."
 azkare.26.a:0 "They will learn of our peaceful ways, through violence!"

 azkare.27.t:0 "Arawkelin Accepts!"
 azkare.27.d:0 "Arawkelin has accepted our offer of estates in Thidinkai; now we must fulfil our promise to their proud and difficult nobility."
 azkare.27.a:0 "Glorious our future will be"

 azkare.28.t:0 "Arawkelin Accepts!"
 azkare.28.d:0 "Arawkelin has accepted our offer of trade rights; with our help their future will be bright and prosperous."
 azkare.28.a:0 "Glorious our future will be"

 azkare.29.t:0 "Arawkelin Accepts!"
 azkare.29.d:0 "Arawkelin has accepted our offer of military aid; through this pact we can bring light to both the lost elves of the south and the people of the jungle."
 azkare.29.a:0 "Glorious our future will be"



 azkare.35.t:0 "Halessi Tea Houses"
 azkare.35.d:0 "As our bureaucracy has grown, they have also developed a culture of their own. With easy access to tea, many in our court have grown quite addicted to the drink. The increase in demand has led to a crop of teahouses springing up wherever there are public servants to drink it, and their insatiability only grows."
 azkare.35.a:0 "Well it is quite delicious!"

 azkare.36.t:0 "A Stroll through the Streets"
 azkare.36.d:0 "The apparatus of our court is slow to move, but today the last of it snakes its way into the ruling district of Sarisung. For many members of our bureaucracy, the trip to the city has been a disappointing one. Across the continent tales are told of the great city, a place of endless possibility and history. But from what we can see from the top of the high palace, the only miraculous thing about the city is its sheer, impossible magnitude. It is time to walk the streets.\n\nFrom a bird’s eye perspective, the true squalor of the city is understated; walking amongst the streets it becomes truly shocking. Miles and miles of slums stretch in every direction, interspersed with raucous markets and ruined towers. Sullen eyes peer at us from the windows of houses as we pass by, while on street corners the enforcers of the city gangs stare menacingly. But we will not be intimidated by their fury. The status quo of this great city must be disturbed in order to make it the jewel of Haless, nay, the jewel of Halann.\n\nWe must purge the corruption of the gangs, encourage the return of artisans, and restore wealth and order to the long neglected Sarisung. Though it may be costly, this place truly does have the near endless potential described in its stories."
 azkare.36.a:0 "Soon to be a shining symbol for all of Haless"

 azkare.37.t:0 "The Xia Revolt!"
 azkare.37.d:0 "The Xia have alway been reluctant subjects to elven rule, among all the nations of Haless it is theirs that holds the greatest antipathy for elven rule. Now their years of plotting open rebellion have come to a head and they rise up en masse against our prosperous rule. There is a certain irony to the fact that we elves have managed to unify them, if only for them to immediately turn upon us.\n\nWe have tried to show these people peace, order, and dignity, but they have made it clear that they would rather lurk in the shadows of antique glory. It is time to drag them into the future of Haless through force."
 azkare.37.a:0 "We will triumph where Jaerel failed!"

 azkare.38.t:0 "Ruling the Xia"
 azkare.38.d:0 "Of all our new subjects, it has been the Xiaken who have been the most resistant to our beneficent rule. They have plotted and rebelled against us, using their considerable experience in both in war and in hostile diplomacy to pose a significant threat to our attempts to bring them, and all other Halessi, peace and civilisation. But now, as our soldiers bring security to their lands and our administrators bring order and prosperity, it seems the Xia have finally realised what it means to walk with us towards a new dawn for all Haless."
 azkare.38.a:0 "They see the light"

 azkare.39.t:0 "Dagran Krakovar"
 azkare.39.d:0 "With the monarchy of Verkal Ozovar dissolved following their integration into our state, members of the underking’s court have been present in Azkare. Recently, one such former member, a young cousin of the king named Dagran Krakovar, has been spending more and more time with Hiderion. The exact nature of their discussions have been kept private, but word around the court suggests that much of it involves grand sweeping infrastructure reforms that, shockingly, seem to include the revitalisation of all Haless as their intended goal."
 azkare.39.a:0 "The ambition of a dwarf and an elf working together is truly matchless."

 azkare.40.t:0 "Elves of Sarisung"
 azkare.40.d:0 "As our census takers have begun to map more and more of the sprawling city, they have found something that has shocked the entire court: An entire community of elves living in clusters within the expansive slums surrounding the city’s heart. Initially we were overjoyed, until our officials began to speak of their condition. Poverty, persecution, and disease run rife among them, even worse than in the rest of the slums. They are frequently extorted, threatened and even outright murdered. This situation is obviously unacceptable, and we have already dispatched soldiers to begin uplifting these sunrise elves out of their squalor and recruiting them into our own administration."
 azkare.40.a:0 "They will make fine convocationaries."

 azkare.41.t:0 "Elven District of Sarisung"
 azkare.41.d:0 "It has become the custom of many of our retired convocationaries to move into the apartments around the High Dawn Academy in the Kethur district of Sarisung and begin to raise families there. With each year since the Academy’s construction, more and more elven children have been born into lives of safety and security, a far sight from the situation of many in the city when we first arrived.\n\nRecently our census takers returned with a report that in the district elves have become the majority. While the official stance of the court is neutral, simply attributing it to natural demographic shifting, one cannot help but notice the buoyed spirits within the convocation. For so many years sunrise elves have struggled to make a home in Haless, and to many this momentous report marks the end of that journey."
 azkare.41.a:0 "May they live beautiful lives in the light of the sun."

 azkare.42.t:0 "Empire of the Rising Sun"
 azkare.42.d:0 "From the highest balconies of the convocation in Sarisung one can see about halfway to the city’s edge. Today, the view is resplendent with the sights and sounds of a festival, one which, before our custodianship of the city, would never have been possible. The slums have been cleared and replaced with vast swathes of residential sprawl, the ruined streets have been repaired, buildings of administration have been erected across the city, and as it is in Azkare, so it is across the entire country. Where once Haless was ruined by centuries of warlordism and petty conquests, now it is finally on the road to repair.\n\nFor many, however, the declaration of the Sunrise Empire only marks the beginning of our ambitions. While our people celebrate the empire, the administration turns its eyes towards the horizons, where the unification of all Haless awaits us."

 azkare.43.d:0 "With the fall of the Raj, many of their princes and administrators are suddenly, for the first time in their lives, denied the authority they were raised from birth to accept. This has left many of them desiring a place in our new empire, and recently representatives from a variety of Harimari ministries have petitioned us for a place in our burgeoning empire. They claim that their skills can be of great use to us in the expansion of our empire. However, many in the convocation believe that to incorporate them into our administration so soon would only be a sign of weakness, and that by denying their offers of aid we can show Haless we are a new empire, capable of thriving without the trappings of old Haless."
 azkare.43.a:0 "Their expertise will be invaluable to us in the coming years."

 azkare.44.t:0 "The Aiztszúir"
 azkare.44.d:0 "With Azkare having sounded the call to bring our elven brethren home, we are now realising the full diversity of their philosophies. One group in particular has begun to coagulate in our elven populace: the Aiztszúir or "Sons of the East." They believe in the right of elven rule and model themselves after Jaher, rather than Jaerel like the rest of Azkare. Many of them still revere Surael and, in spite of the poverty of recent years, see themselves as his true heirs.\n\nRecently, their leader, Urion Salaszúir, has been demanding positions for his people in our government. While their skills are not up for debate, our advisors have urged caution in allowing these extremists into positions of power."

 azkare.45.t:0 "The Aiztszúir in the Military"
 azkare.45.d:0 "Urion Salaszúir of the Aiztszúir has returned, this time demanding officer commissions for his soldiers. They claim that they have spent much of their exile emulating the Jaherian legions of old, training in the arts of war in secret, until the opportunity once again came for elven rule. Urion also drew the court’s attention to the large number of recruits the Aiztszúir have garnered since their arrival in Azkare. A thinly veiled threat, but an effective one."

 azkare.46.da:0 "A missive was delivered to the Citadel of Dawn this morning listing the demands of the Aiztszúir. Principally, the resignation of Hiderion Tonanzúir to be replaced with Urion Salaszúir, not as lord of Azkare, but as king. They also demand the revocation of various policies of equality, establishing elves as ascendant above all others in Azkare, with Surael as the one true god of the state."
 azkare.46.db:0 "With the Aiztszúir now integrated into every level of our government, they seem to finally be appeased. Unfortunately, nothing in the nation can happen without the acquiescence of Urion Salaszúir and his faction. While we have kept peace, the shadow of the Aiztszúir will loom behind us for many years."

When one walks down a city street one no longer sees Yan, Bom, or Raheni - one only sees Sarisungi, as the people all fall into the melting pot of the Jewel of the World."

 azkare.48.t:0 "Nur Yemenar"
 azkare.48.d:0 "As the sun rises over Sarisung, a long lived observer might recognise the changes the city has undergone since it was first a part of Azkare. The slums have been cleared, and where they were there are now densely packed residential buildings, housing most of the millions that call the city home. Gone are the filthy, mud streets, replaced instead with tree-lined boulevards. And at its centre, with bright towers soaring high above the city, is the Sunrise Convocation, where the lives of hundreds of millions of Halessi citizens are ministered over by elven wisdom.\n\nShould the same observer broaden his gaze, they might see similar signs of change across the whole continent. Where once there were slave markets, now free men move goods from port to port. Whole towns devastated by constant battle have been rebuilt, their people living in safety. Wealth now flows across the great highways and through the cities of the empire, that each and every citizen might live in paradise, in an empire of all Haless.\n\nThe work of centuries has been completed, with the dreams of many great men from ages past fulfilled."

Now, as we expand further into new parts of the continent with new cultures to integrate into our empire, many of the Kai feel as if they are being left behind. While it is true that our eyes have been set on the horizons as of late, many in our court believe that we should not forget the people of our homeland, without whom we could not have made it to where we are now."

 azkare.204.d:0 "When Jaher first took the easternmost city in Haless, it became clear that it would make a fine centre from which his eastern holdings could be administered. To that end, he built the Hall of the Rising Sun, a palace from which he, or his governor, could rule over the city and the Yan region. Now that we have held the city for a time, we have seen fit to repair that palace of old, converting it into a branch of the convocation that we might cement our rule where Jaher never could."

Now that we control the city, many elves from the countryside have chosen to settle with their own kind within its streets."

They believe that, through their leadership, a new era of elven martial arts can be born in Azkare. It is a testament to Amaraeis’ skill that he has already managed to build a small following, and with proper support from the state who knows what they can accomplish."

They bring with them many connections in local trade, most of which are members of their own family, both elven and half-elven.

Already, work has begun relocating soldiers and supplies into the fortress to facilitate its revitalisation. Those already stationed there have been studying the now historical tactics of the Shining Lancers, those last remnants of Jaher’s legions in Haless.

She pads across the grass, finding Hiderion seated and tranquil as she first did so many years ago. He opens his eyes and stands, offering a slight bow. "Lady Saetae, how does the day find you?"\nShe rolls her eyes at the formality, but the habits of a century of life are not so easy to break. "Well, Hiderion."\n\nThe pair set out into the garden in silence, taking in the dawn.\nAfter some time Mya speaks, breaking the tranquillity. "You have been away from court, so I haven’t had the chance to tell you. I intend to be married."\nHiderion’s eyes, normally so serene, widen in shock. "Ah, congratulations."\nHe grasps desperately for something to say. "The state will pay for it of course."\nMya laughs, "I’d hope so."\n"So… when will I meet your groom? I am interested in the man whose quality could charm the heart of Mya Saetae." "Oh, well, that won’t be necessary." Her face flushes a deeper red, not just from the cold air.\nHiderion looks a little crestfallen. "I have clearly misjudged our relationship. I had considered you my friend but that was presumptuous of me. I beg your forgiveness."\n"You have misjudged our relationship, Hiderion, quite badly in fact.

I should have given you more time…"\nMya silences him with a long stare. "I didn’t want you to. How could I spend my last months distracting you from your dream? That is not how I wanted to die." The words are laboured, difficult. "Look at what we have managed, Hiderion. We have built the foundations of your beautiful dream. We have raised a fine son. We have shared our love."\nHiderion doesn’t reply, tears pouring freely down his golden skin.\n\nFor the next few hours he whispers to her as she drifts away, speaking each profession of love that he never had the chance to say during their long romance until, finally, her breathing ceases.\n\nIt is a full day before Hiderion emerges from the chamber.

Hiderion ponders the letter for a moment. The death does not come as a surprise, but there is still a certain sense of melancholy surrounding it. He opens the letter, a list of Rama’s estates and titles to be shared amongst his many children, most of them members of the Shining Lancers. Hiderion nods as he reads through all of them, remembering their numerous faces.

To the people of the Sunrise Empire, he was a caring ruler and a great statesman, one whose tireless efforts to undo the damages done to Haless through centuries of war have brought a better life for all his citizens.

They are capable of calling forth immense arcane forces with only the movement of their bodies and the channelling of their internal energies, without the need for the complex rituals and reagents that other elven mages need. As such, they make fine war wizards, capable of improvisation and flexibility that allows for significant combat prowess."
 azkare.236.a:0 "Elves have so much to offer this continent."

 azkare.237.t:0 "Excellent Convocationary Sets Example"
 azkare.237.d:0 "As far as governments go, the Convocation is remarkably free of corruption. However, occasionally some will still slip through the cracks; a few bribes, some preferential treatment, a bit of pork barrelling. But thanks to the tireless work of a notable Convocationary, corruption has reduced markedly, not only through their efforts to eliminate it, but also through the example they have set for their peers of what true excellence looks like."
 azkare.237.a:0 "We thank them for their service."

 azkare.238.t:0 "District Reforms"
 azkare.238.d:0 "A few administrative districts in our empire have various holdovers from before their integration that leads them to be less than democratic. Through a concerted effort from the Convocation, many of these flaws in the republic have been polished out, resulting in a fairer system for all."
 azkare.238.a:0 "Our republic is strengthened."

 azkare.239.t:0 "Brilliant Convocationary"
 azkare.239.d:0 "While we admire the efforts of all our Convocationaries, one in particular has come to our attention. Their skill at administering their particular corner of the empire has brought them much prestige, and many are saying that they are wasted as a simple representative. Our highest advisory board has room for one such as them."
 azkare.239.a:0 "Recruit them at once!"

 azkare.240.t:0 "Restoring Halessi Culture"
 azkare.240.d:0 "We have long watched the spreading stain of the Wuhyun "cultures" fostered by the Command with disgust - they impose their society upon the disparate and varied peoples of Haless, crushing them into uniformity beneath their boots. With the iron fist of the hobgoblins replaced by our benevolent rule, we can and will amend these indignities where possible. Having witnessed fresh celebrations and festivals of local culture, organised promptly by our administrators, the citizens in our newly liberated Wuhyun provinces once again look fondly upon life before hobgoblin occupation. Already they have converted in droves, reviving their original cultures and traditions, eschewing the hobgoblins' mockery of a society and throwing their yoke off once and for all."
 azkare.240.a:0 "Welcome back."

 sunrise.0.t:0 "Hiderion Retires"
 sunrise.0.d:0 "It has been a long, long road. For many in Azkare, now the Sunrise Empire proper, the rule of Hiderion has been all they have known, and most who were born under his rule expected to die under it as well. Hiderion, however, is determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past. The only way to ensure a peaceful succession is to pass it to his successor while he still lives, avoiding the bloody civil wars of the Phoenix Empire.\n\nAnd so, in the first true election of the Sunrise Empire, to the shock of the people, Hiderion’s name did not appear on the ballot. In a speech before the gathered crowds of Sarisung, he thanked them for the opportunity to serve, but reminded them that for peace to reign, there must never be one true ruler of Haless, it must instead be governed by peace and philosophy. Hiderion the Great, Haless’ mightiest ruler since the days of Jaerel, will retire in peace back to his true home of Azkare, where he will spend time writing his memoirs and tending his garden, surrounded by the work of a lifetime."
 sunrise.0.a:0 "It takes true love for one's country to surrender power for its greater good"
 sunrise.1.t:0 "Sunrise Elections"
 sunrise.1.d:0 "The time has come for the current Emperor to leave their position. The last year has been one filled with electoral campaigns across the empire by the most prominent members of the Court. The people have voted, and the results have been revealed. The new emperor now prepares to take their throne with the blessings of the populace and their peers."
 sunrise.2.d:0 "The previous Emperor has met an untimely end, and emergency elections have been called across the empire. The votes were gathered and counted swiftly in the wake of the tragedy, and the people's Emperor is ready to take the throne already."
 sunrise.1.a:0 "May their reign be prosperous and glorious!"
