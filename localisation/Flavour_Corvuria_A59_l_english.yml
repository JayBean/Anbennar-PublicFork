 A59_propaganda_desc: "Our relatives in Asheniande think themselves better than us, but they are nothing more than secessionists and pawns of the Dove Throne.

 A59_imperial_diplomacy_title: "Imperial Diplomacy"
 A59_imperial_diplomacy_desc: "The first human king of Corvuria, Lucian the Protector, was no doubt a brave warrior, but also an excellent diplomat. He impressed Jaher and was the only human to be given command of one of Jaher's realms and gave our people much autonomy under Jaher's Phoenix Empire.

 A59_secure_heartland_title: "Secure the Heartland"
 A59_secure_heartland_desc: "With Ravenhill retaken it is critical that it shall not be used as an alternative point of invasion. A fortress in that position will deter all invasions of the heartland."
 A59_secure_corvuria_title: "Reinvigorate Corvuria"
 A59_secure_corvuria_desc: "Many of our enemies accuse us of being a poor backwater that deserves to be ruled by a richer neighbor. Now is the time to put such rumors to rest once and for all, and show that Corvuria is a power comparable to the likes of Gawed or Lorent!"
 
 A59_tax_priests_title: "Tax the Priests of Nerat"
 A59_tax_priests_desc: "The god Nerat stands as the guardian of death, and is a threat to those who wish to live forever. If this kingdom is to last eternally, it must not fear death, but instead embrace it."

 A59_capitol_fort_desc: "Bal Dostan was the original name for Arca Corvur and was the center of power for Castan's Empire in the region. During the Dragonwake its stewards fled and abandoned the people, and our ancestors, the Korbarid, occupied and secured the citadel and gave shelter to Korbarid and Castanorian alike. Thanks to our... patrons, we have gained the resources necessary to repair Bal Dostan and restore the decrepit village the lies beneath its gaze. The Village of Corvuria will once again be a humble yet bustling community, which provides us manpower, and our patrons... livestock."
 A59_dark_lords_title: "Placate the Dark Lords"
 A59_dark_lords_desc: "Vampires have been part of modern-day Corvuria since the Aldresian Crusade of 1044, the first of their kind were even our strongest and most powerful crusaders.

 A59_parley_mages_title: "Parley with the Curious"
 A59_parley_mages_desc: "Of all the power groups across Cannor, none are more inquisitive than the mages of the Magisterium. Their pursuit of knowledge has led to their highest members to know the grim truth of our lords, but surprisingly, they are nothing but pragmatic. With some well placed words we can reach an understanding with this institution, where all groups benefit in a treaty in their support to uphold the masquerade in exchange for forbidden knowledge."
 A59_grand_masquerade_title: "The Grand Masquerade"
 A59_grand_masquerade_desc: "As commoners and nobles dance about the grand halls of Arca Corvur, they are unaware that some of their fellow guests are blood-drinkers. That those very individuals, who dance alongside them in the Masquerade hold dominion of the fate of this nation. That those individuals have the capacity to live longer even then elves. That those individuals... are vampires. And now with no other group strong enough to contest them, their dance has only just begun."
 A59_blood_court_title: "The Court of Blood"
 A59_blood_court_desc: "Penumbra covers these lands, the dark aristocracy stands ready to take command of the night, and all it needs is the organization to coordinate their efforts. We are happy to oblige them, and with the seat of such power in Arca Corvur, all shadows in Cannor will serve us."
 
 A59_prepare_resettlement_title: "Prepare Resettlement"
 A59_prepare_resettlement_desc: "The region known as Daravan's Folly was once the economic center of the old Korbarid Kingdom until it was ruined by one of our own ancient kings, Daravan the Malignant, who flooded the lands with terrible magic to prevent the gnollish Third Xhaz. In his attempt to save the land, he instead doomed our forefathers to live in the poorer north where we still live in to this day.\n\nIf the adventurers and Escanni to the north can fight to reclaim their homeland against the Greentide, then surely we can do the same?"
 A59_resettle_dreadmire_title: "Resettle Dreadmire"
 A59_resettle_dreadmire_desc: "The Dreadmire, before its slaughter at the hands of gnolls, was one of several areas protected by Arca Corvur. It will receive this protection again."
 A59_resettle_flooded_coast_title: "Resettle Flooded Coast"
 A59_resettle_flooded_coast_desc: "The now Flooded Coast was once the heart of trade in Southern Escann. With the distasteful city of Nathalaire sitting just off the shores now controlling the flow of goods, our goal is made clear: Take back the coastline and prepare to invade."
 
 A59_prepare_fleet_title: "Raise a Fleet"
 A59_prepare_fleet_desc: "Our armies are more than capable of laying waste to Nathalaire, the issue is getting them there. Naval warfare may not be our specialty, but where there is money to be made there will always be willing participants."
 A59_subjugate_nathalire_title: "Subjugate Nathalaire"
 A59_subjugate_nathalire_desc: "With our control of the mainland established all that is left is to make the maritime city of Nathalaire bend the knee. The end of this pathetic state has arrived."

 A59_reports_ravenmarch_desc: "After the end of the Greentide we sent forward an expedition to claim the abandoned territory in the name of Corvuria. Now that they have settled down and made a nation of their own it is time to remind them of their purpose."
 A59_return_investment_title: "Return on the Investment"
 A59_return_investment_desc: "The Ravenmarch owes its existence to Corvurian patronage, and by all rights the territory is rightfully part of Corvuria. We shall collect our due."
 
 A59_bal_ouord_title: "The Weakened Citadel"
 A59_bal_ouord_desc: "Like Bal Dostan, Bal Ouord also barely weathered the sands of time, no less storm of the Greentide. Now it is said to stand as an island against the goblin hordes. Under our rule, the citadel has a chance of recovery."
 A59_madiroud_title: "Reclaim the Southern Cities"
 A59_madiroud_desc: "While they are not Corvurian, the Ourdi do share some history with us in shared heritage under the greater Dostanorian Dominion. With Dostanor gone, it falls to us to ensure their safety."

 A59_secure_south_title: "Secure the Southern Flank"
 A59_secure_south_desc: "The lands of Ourdia and the Folly have been ruined by invaders plundering the land and trying to make it theirs. To prevent this fate and ensure Corvurian rule of the region further fortifications shall be built."
 
 A59_till_undeath_title: "'Til Undeath Do Us Part"

While the Pestilience is long gone, the Aldresian knights still treat our people with contempt as if we were still plagued, or worse, undead!

 A59_improve_fabric_title: "Improve Fabric Industry"
 A59_improve_fabric_desc: "Corvurian high fashion is, rightfully, well regarded by our neighbors.

 A59_import_silk_desc: "With the rising popularity of our Masquerade celebration, there is some need for fancier cloth to be used exclusively for costuming.

 A59_artificer_unorthodoxy_desc: "As the art of artificery becomes more common and the fields and schools begin to establish there are those who have begun practicing more unorthodox and less humane methods. While in their old age the Midnight Lords view any such things with suspicion, if Corvuria is to survive we must not fall behind on such deadly advancements.

 A59_swamp_fuel_title: "Fuel from the Swamps"
 A59_swamp_fuel_desc: "As industrial techniques sweep across Cannor, the prospect of finding fuel in the boggy swamps may become viable. With appropriate preparations the peat of the swampland may easily be put to use getting our foot in the door of these developments."
