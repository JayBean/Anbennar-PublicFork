 goblin_borrowed_learning_title:0 ""Borrowed" Knowledge"
 goblin_borrowed_learning_desc:0 "We must scavenge for what we can in the ruins of this world we now find ourselves in. Every little scrap. Perhaps then we can find something worthwhile.\n\nOur neighbors near us also squat on the ruins of what once was. We're started to run out of ruins of our own to root through. Perhaps they could have something worthwhile?"
 goblin_ingenuity_title:0 "Goblin Ingenuity"
 goblin_ingenuity_desc:0 "Escann has a lot of new sights and people. Many of these people are tall, and get very very angry when you get near. But despite this they seem to have a lot of interesting tools and ideas! Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from these tall folk?"
 goblin_superiority_title:0 "Goblin Superiority"
 goblin_superiority_desc:0 "We have taken the Cannorians' ideas and ran with it. Sure, they might still consider us backwards, monstrous, worthless creatures. But a goblin's mind is QUICK, and they underestimate us! We shall show our superiority yet."
 goblin_warmachine_title:0 "The Goblin Warmachine"
 goblin_warmachine_desc:0 "For the entire history of our society, our military has been little more than clansmen scrambling with sticks and rocks. Now our sticks and rocks explode.\n\nWe must form a true army, something to both protect us, and show off our superiority! And nothing says superiority more than MORE explosions! We shall become a force to be reckoned with, yet!"
 goblin_rest_of_us_title:0 "The Rest Of Us"
 goblin_rest_of_us_desc:0 "We are not the only clan to escape the caves. Countless of our brothers were dragged here as well, and there are still many orcish clans nearby as well.\n\nWe all have some kind of connection, no matter how small. Perhaps they could be of some use to us? One way or another..."
 goblin_faith_means_title:0 "What Faith Means To Us"
 goblin_faith_means_desc:0 "As we try to find our place in this world, many of us will turn to faith. Goblins, in general, are rather pragmatic when it comes to our faith. We've taken care of ourselves on our own this entire time, why would we need gods to help us?\n\nBut in these troubling times, the offer of some kind of support is comforting. And the Cannorian pantheon has so many interesting ideas! Perhaps we could learn from them?"
 goblin_learning_common_title:0 "Learning Common"
 goblin_learning_common_desc:0 "A raiding party brought us some kind of leather package they had found during one of their scavenges through the old cities. It tasted quite bad, and had a lot of weird scribbles in it. Our wisemen suggest that it is a form of writing that the Cannorians call "Common".\n\nThis could prove quite useful to us. If our leadership tried to learn this foreign way of speaking, they could more easily communicate and learn more from them. And, in turn, could more easily take advantage of situations with the Cannorians..."
 goblin_wild_orcs_title:0 "'Convincing' the Wild Orcs"
 goblin_wild_orcs_desc:0 "The regions surrounding our settlements contain many orcish hordes, disorganized and lost after the fall of the Dookanson. We've decided what to do with the orcs within our borders, but perhaps the ones just outside could be just as useful to us?\n\nIt can be surprisingly easy to convince an orc to do what you want them to do. It takes a small show of strength, a little cleverness, and a bit of luck, to convince them that it was THEIR idea to help us farm, all along!"
 goblin_old_cities_title:0 "The Old Cities"
 goblin_old_cities_desc:0 "Ruins of old settlements litter Escann, a sign of the damage we, and the orcs, did when we first entered this land. As we repopulate the area, we must come to a conclusion of what it is we plan to do with this new nation we made\n\nWhy is it that we expand ever further? Is it to protect ourselves? Or perhaps to rebuild from the damage we caused? Whatever the answer, it is something we must come to realize for ourselves."
 goblin_meat_wall_title:0 "A Meat Wall"
 goblin_meat_wall_desc:0 "The Dookanson has fallen, and we are alone.\n\nThe orcs have abandoned us to our fate, and in some cases struck back at us, either for some untold grudge, or so that they may scrounge their way up from the bottom with us. The masses are in disarray, terrified of what will come next.\n\nWhat must come next, is a force to defend us. If we're going to survive here, we're going to need a lot of forces. Thankfully, we can supply them."
 goblin_new_home_title:0 "Our New Home"
 goblin_new_home_desc:0 "Now that we have a force to defend us as long as we're here, we need to step back and see what "here" really is. There is much empty land around us for the taking, kept only by disorganized orcish hordes. Perhaps, if we're lucky, we can take some of that land for ourselves."
 goblin_old_masters_title:0 "Our Old Masters"
 goblin_old_masters_desc:0 "For centuries we were little more than fodder to be killed by the dDwarves, or in some cases, enslaved. Then the orcs came, and we were little more than fodder to be enslaved, or in some cases, killed.\n\nWe have been stepped on for most of our history. That's how we came to be here, fodder for the Dookansons's armies. But we're in charge here, and there are some orcs in our midst, now living among us. What should we do about this?\n\nSome of our elders wish for a debt to be paid, for all that they've suffered. Many younger progressive minds, however, believe that we should let bygones be bygones, and together the orcs and us can survive in this harsh world. We must decide for ourselves how to handle out old masters."
 goblin_new_nation_title:0 "A New Nation"
 goblin_new_nation_desc:0 "We have done more than survived, we have thrived. Our society has grown from a disparate collection of clans and families into a sprawling young society. We've learned much and come far. But we have so much farther to go."
 goblin_survivors_title:0 "Survivors"
 goblin_survivors_desc:0 "We've been beaten and slaughtered for all of history. But we survived. We were dragged to Escann, as nothing more than weak fodder to be thrown at the humans, but still we survived. After the Dookanson fell, we were left alone, broken, the weakest force in a realm of adventurers and orcs. But still, we survived.\n\nWe will continue to survive. We will take what we have learned here, and show we are more than just skulking monsters in the dark. We are survivors, and we rule these lands."
 goblin_remove_ambitious_title:0 "Remove the Ambitious"
 goblin_remove_ambitious_desc:0 "The peasants are restless. Goblins are, inherently, an easily scared people. At the first sign of danger or harm, the immediate reaction is to flee into a nearby cave. And where there's unrest and scared masses, there are many who would take advantage of them.\n\nThese goblins must be stopped. If we are to survive, we need to take out these ambitious, who would destroy us for their own personal gain."
 goblin_safe_homes_title:0 "Safe, Secure Homes"
 goblin_safe_homes_desc:0 "With the ambitious in our ranks gone, we now need to better calm the masses. Cries of the end times are common, and any force on the horizon is enough to terrify a good portion of our militia. In order to calm the panicked, we must protect them well."
 goblin_selfish_among_us_title:0 "The Selfish Amongst Us"
 goblin_selfish_among_us_desc:0 "Perhaps we did not remove all of the ambitious from our ranks, after all. As we grow and thrive in this new world, there are many among us who would scramble to take what little scavenge they can find for their own personal collections and profits.\n\nThe most powerful and richest goblins among us refuse to share with the chieftan and leaders, refusing to help us with our goals. Some leaders believe if we leave them to their own devices, they could still be useful. But others think we should repurpose their ill-gotten gains."
 goblin_pride_title:0 "A Goblin's Pride"
 goblin_pride_desc:0 "Goblins have often been slaves to the larger folk, used as fodder in mines, or on farms. While we loath this history, we have to admit we are quite good at it. In spite of the troubled history of our people, we are one of the best when it comes to creating goods, whether to sell, eat, or use.\n\nWe should build up the economy and production lines in our new nation, and live up to this deep seated pride in all goblins!"
 goblin_edible_things_title:0 "Things That Are Edible"
 goblin_edible_things_desc:0 "Even disorganized hordes need to eat. Luckily these new lands are rich in edible things. Not as many mushrooms here, and our elders whine for lack of their favorite mushrooms to munch on, but there are many new interesting foods to taste here. We must do our best to try and gather a sizable quantity."
 goblin_shiny_metals_title:0 "Working With Shiny Metals"
 goblin_shiny_metals_desc:0 "Metals are not quite as abundant here as they were in the caves, but they are just as necessary to possess, if not more. We should look to collect some, so we may continue our tinkering on these new Cannorian weapons we keep scavenging!"
 goblin_weapons_fit_title:0 "Weapons Fit For A Goblin"
 goblin_weapons_fit_desc:0 "Swords are not quite right for a Goblin. Bows are too unwieldy. Don't even get me started on battle axes.\n\nThe right weapon has avoided us for centuries, but in this new land, we have discovered something that fascinates us, and can help us turn the tides of war. Whether it be shot from a cannon, or flung from a hand, nothing changes the tide of battle quite like a good explosion."
 goblin_fighting_like_a_goblin_title:0 "Fighting Like a Goblin"
 goblin_fighting_like_a_goblin_desc:0 "Fighting in the caves was so easy. In the cramped tunnels of the Serpentspine, we could simple overwhelm the enemy in a swarm. The surface is... so wide, so open. We need to develop new tactics, before we are overwhelmed, ourselves."
 goblin_neighbors_usefulness_title:0 "Neighbor's Usefulness"
 goblin_neighbors_usefulness_desc:0 "While many Cannorians want little more than to chase us away with violence, we have come across a few who are willing to trade what we need for what we already have. This trade seems like it could be very useful.... Perhaps we could be good at this."
 goblin_place_in_this_world_title:0 "Our Place In This World"
 goblin_place_in_this_world_desc:0 "As we discover more about the history of this world we now find ourselves in, we must ask new, uncomfortable questions about our place in this world. Are we little more than hordes of monsters, here to pillage and raid? Or can we be more?\n\nWe must determine, once and for all, the measure of a goblin."

 escanngoblin.1.t:0 "Why We Expand"
 escanngoblin.1.d:0 "We have lived among the sky and the taller folk for many decades now. We have come far in that time, and changed much. When we left the mountain we were a fractured broken people, under the foot of the orcs. Now we are our own nation. As we conquer new lands and expand, spreading out influence, we must ask: why?\n\nFor what reason do we expand further into Escann?"
 escanngoblin.1.a:0 "To rebuild what once was!"
 escanngoblin.1.b:0 "So that we may never again suffer."
 escanngoblin.1.c:0 "We simply take what we need to survive in this harsh world."
 
 escanngoblin.2.t:0 "The Selfish Goblin"
 escanngoblin.2.d:0 "We are in a harsh world, and its made harsher by some of those who live in our circles. As our nation grows stronger, and important, more rich, there are many among us who take this oppportunity to smuggle and horde ill-gotten gains. Either stolen from the larger folk, or even from the rest of us.\n\nIn order to further ourselves as society, we must decide: how do we handle these selfish goblins amongst us?"
 escanngoblin.2.a:0 "We must make these Goblins... "share" their wealth, for the good of the nation."
 escanngoblin.2.b:0 "These Goblins stole their wealth fair and square. We should allow them to do what they want with it!"
 
 escanngoblin.3.t:0 "The Measure of a Goblin"
 escanngoblin.3.d:0 "The life of a goblin. What does that mean? As our society advances and we learn  more, not only into how things explode but into culture and history, we come to a crossroads.n\nThis world we find ourselves in is truly complex. The caves were not as complex. Surviving was hard, yes, but not complex. Here there's so much more than angry dwarves or angry orcs. Sometimes there are angry humans and elves, too.\n\nAs we move forward, we must as how we interact with the world around us. What is a goblin, in this world? How do we want to hold ourselves?"
 escanngoblin.3.a:0 "We should focus outwards"
 escanngoblin.3.b:0 "We should focus inwards"
 
 escanngoblin.4.t:0 "Our Former Masters"
 escanngoblin.4.d:0 "We were subjugated by the orcs many, many years ago. We were dragged to these lands under the hard fist of the orcs. And now here they are, in lands we now rule.\n\nA few arguments have broken out amongst leadership on how to deal with our old masters. We could attempt to make up for the past, move on, try to break from this cycle of violence, generations long...\n\nOr, we could perhaps... "convince" the orcs into a deal of indentured servitude to pay their debts. Generations of orcs, paying off the violence of their ancestors. The benefits to the economy would be tempting enough, for many Goblins. What shall we decide?"
 escanngoblin.4.a:0 "Forgive and integrate them"
 escanngoblin.4.b:0 "They can pay off their dues... in time."
 
 escanngoblin.5.t:0 "Our Former Masters, our Indentured Servants"
 escanngoblin.5.d:0 "It has been many years since we've, ahem, convinced the orcs into indentured servitude. Entire generations have come and gone under the debts of their ancestors.\n\nNow, many are asking the question: When do these dues end? Have the orcs earned their right to freedom in our lands, yet?"
 escanngoblin.5.a:0 "Very well, they have paid their dues to society."
 escanngoblin.5.b:0 "Actually, we've grown used to this arrangement..."
