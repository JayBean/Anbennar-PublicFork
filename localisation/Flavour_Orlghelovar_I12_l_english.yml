 flavor_orlghelovar.1.t:0 "Open the Outside Markets"
 flavor_orlghelovar.1.d:0 "There is a hushed silence in the state hall as head representative Gloma Firebellow of the glassblowers’ guild presents the engraved wooden box to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The chamber is filled with curious government officials, representatives, and nobles of the hold’s burgeoning merchant clans. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] inspects the oak box, running a finger over its varnished surface and the crest of Orlghelovar engraved into its lid, before flipping the metal clasps and opening the container. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] lifts out a single goblet of perfectly clear crystal glass, mold-blown with an intricate pattern of geometric lines that runs from the rim to the base, each line of identical width and spacing despite the curved surface. The representative Firebellow holds her breath. \n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] lifts the glass up to catch one of the narrow shafts of daylight carried deep into the hold by the state hall’s intricate system of glass-paned surface light-wells. The light splits on the crystalline edge of one point of the goblet’s pattern, and casts a spectrum of colors across the floor. \n\nThus far, Orlghelovar has been little more than a pioneer settlement, a band of former adventurers squatting in the mausoleum of some of the greatest craft-dwarves of Serpentreach. The workshops and foundries may have been re-opened, but our products have been rudimentary; good enough to serve our domestic markets for bottles and houseware, and for limited trade with traveling merchants passing outside the surface entrance, but not worthy of bearing the maker’s mark of Orlghelovar. \n\nBut this, this is different. This is worthy of the legacy of the Glass Lords. The wooden box is velvet-lined, and filled with twenty of these goblets, all perfectly identical. With glass of this quality, unrivaled in Cannor or Bulwar, Orlghelovar can proudly re-open for trade with the outside world."
 flavor_orlghelovar.1.a:0 "This is but the start of our legacy!"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.2.t:0 "Benefits of an Open Market"
 flavor_orlghelovar.2.d:0 "Our re-entry into international trade and our capital’s position close to the surface has brought many foreign traders from Bulwar and Ourdia to our hold. Our markets and merchant districts now bustle not only with dwarves, but with blonde-haired sun elves, stern-faced Ourdians, and friendly Bulwari. \n\nThe volume and frequency of trade has become so great that a group of human traders have successfully petitioned [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] to settle in our hold permanently, and already a cluster of houses close to our warehouse district have been remodeled to comfortably accommodate their new, taller residents."
 flavor_orlghelovar.2.a:0 "Many more will join us soon"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.3.t:0 "Cobalt Glass"
 flavor_orlghelovar.3.d:0 "There was concern when we initially re-founded Orlghelovar that the veins of cobalt-bearing alloys that our forebears once used to create their distinctive, deep blue glass had been lost or exhausted centuries ago. But this is not so! The spirits of our forebears have smiled upon us, as one of our miners not two weeks ago discovered an ancient, abandoned shaft lined with cobaltite. \n\nWith careful experimentation, we have replicated the old method used in Orlghelovar to refine this ore into its powdered form, and by adding the correct amount to the still-molten glass we can produce a vivid, deep blue, a perfect match to classical Cobalt Dwarf wares! This is not just another step toward reclaiming our heritage; it is also a wonderful commercial opportunity! Our customers can drink their dinner wines from crystal glasses the color of the afternoon sky."
 flavor_orlghelovar.3.a:0 "A truly historic moment"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.4.t:0 "Old Bulwar Glass"
 flavor_orlghelovar.4.d:0 "From the journal of Grumbhir Heavybellows, senior accountant for the Cobalt-Bulwari Finehammer Caravan Company: \n\n’’Interesting encounter in the market in Aqatbar today. After meeting with F. Zawari at Alchemist’s Guild, I visited an antique dealer under recommendation of Zawari, accompanied by L. Wirebeard. Wirebeard traveled ahead and I arrived 30 min. hence, only to discover Wirebeard in argument with the owner of the antique emporium, Ms. T. Surakesi, over the provenance of a glass decanter displayed in the store. Wirebeard is once more causing problems with his refusal to properly learn Bulwari. I do not understand Mrs. Finehammer’s tolerance for him, the man could not sell gold to a goblin. I digress. \n\nI spoke to Surakesi in my own (passable) Bulwari, and achieved a pleasant resolution to the argument! Her store is in possession of many antique Cobalt pieces, phenomenal (as always) craftsmanship. I explained our business coming from re-established Orlghelovar, showed her some samples (including my beloved Glomla’s travel flask) I had in my possession. Surakesi passes her compliments to our glassblowers (reminder; pass this on to Glomla). It appears there is a large market for antique Cobalt Dwarf glass in Aqatbar at least, and Ms. Zawari claims this is also the case further south! There appears to be a great opportunity to lever this interest into new customers for our own wares.’’"
 flavor_orlghelovar.4.a:0 "Our Ancestors must be proud"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.5.t:0 "Diamond Tools"
 flavor_orlghelovar.5.d:0 "With our control of Arg-Ôrdstun has come a steady supply of diamonds from the mines surrounding the hold. Some of these are cut and sent straight to market, but other, lower quality diamonds have found a new purpose in our workshops. Dwarves have long been aware of the benefits of diamond-tipped tools for mining, but the superior hardness of diamonds has also shown great utility in precision engraving, cutting, and grinding, allowing us to create finely-detailed work and speed up many of our manufacturing processes. \n\nThe fellows in the glass-engraver’s workshop in Arg-Ôrdstun have sent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] a beautiful sample showcasing the benefits of their new diamond tools: a pair of cut sculptures of flowering serpentsbloom, both identical, one cut from blue cobalt glass and the other from a large sapphire. The two flowers have a pride of place on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] desk."
 flavor_orlghelovar.5.a:0 "Useful Tools"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.6.t:0 "Orlghelovar Sends an Expedition"
 flavor_orlghelovar.6.d:0 "In the past few years there has been a great deal of activity around the great abandoned dwarven hold that overlooks Salla Ayeth. The sounds of construction can be heard echoing from inside the mountain, and flickering lights have been seen in some of the old windows and entrances to the structure. \n\nYesterday, we discovered the reason for this: a group of dwarven scouts, dressed rather unsuitably for traveling in the forest, stumbled across one of our watchtowers. It took us some time to find a suitable translator who spoke common, but eventually the leader introduced herself as Halir Firmhandle, and explained that they had been sent from Orlghelovar, a newly re-established dwarven hold in the Serpentreach east of Salla Cenág, that trades in glassware. They seem to be looking for commercial opportunities, and it must be said that the samples they have brought with them are far more refined than the wood-ash glass our own craftspeople make. The question is whether we trust that trade is all these dwarves are looking for in these woods."
 flavor_orlghelovar.6.a:0 "Never let anyone in!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.6.b:0 "This is an intriguing offer"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.7.t:0 "Deepwoods Expedition"
 flavor_orlghelovar.7.d:0 "We have received news from the leader of the scouting party we dispatched into the deepwoods! Commander Halir Firmhandle’s scouts encountered a wood elf tribe not far from the entrance to Verkal Skomdihr, and they were greatly impressed by the quality of our goods. From her account, these elves have faced similar troubles to ourselves, with marauding orcs and goblins forcing them out of their own lands. \n\nIn return for a generous trade agreement, they have given us a priceless gift: complete and detailed maps of the Deepwoods! Given the rather obvious lack of lumber within our own borders, our merchants are already excited by the prospects of trading with these newly-discovered elven states."
 flavor_orlghelovar.7.a:0 "The Wood Elves will become loyal partners!"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.8.t:0 "Deepwoods Expedition"
 flavor_orlghelovar.8.d:0 "Our scout commander, Halir Firmhandle, returned from her mission into the deepwoods yesterday looking rather worse for wear. As she explained between pulling arrow after bone-tipped arrow out of her leather armor, her scouting party had encountered an elven settlement. While they had approached the elves with offers of trade, the elves had rejected them in no uncertain terms, calling them ‘untrustworthy soil-eaters’ and shooting at them until they were forced to retreat. \n\nThe expedition was not all in vain, though, as Halir’s party did manage to scout out the forest outside Verkal Skomdihr during their trip. At least now we will know who our neighbors are."
 flavor_orlghelovar.8.a:0 "At least now we know more"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.9.t:0 "An Alliance for the Future"
 flavor_orlghelovar.9.d:0 "Following our initial missive, there have been days of negotiations between ourselves and Ovdal Túngr, intensive back-and-forth debates over individual trade clauses and rights and responsibilities toward travelers and merchants. Finally, on the evening of the third day, diplomats from both parties emerged from the state hall of Ovdal Túngr and informed the gathered crowd of local residents and visiting dignitaries that an agreement had been reached. \n\nWe will generously transfer ownership of the surface territory we have taken from the Ourdians and Goblins in Bahar. In return, Ovdal Túngr has given us something equally valuable: access to ocean trade routes in Bulwar and Cannor through their own vessels, a guaranteed military alliance, and a declaration of friendship between our two states. It is a glorious day for Orlghelovar! With this, we take another step toward the future, and we do it arm-in-arm with our copper siblings."
 flavor_orlghelovar.9.a:0 "May the future be prosperous"

 flavor_orlghelovar.10.t:0 "New Policy"
 flavor_orlghelovar.10.d:0 "For many years we have deepened our political and economic ties with our fellow hold of Ovdal Túngr, and it has become increasingly clear that for the most efficient management of our country, it would be best to take more direct control over our client state’s territories. While some in Ovdal Túngr have voiced complaints, they have been allayed with the reassurances that their essential role in shipbuilding and oceanic trade will continue to guarantee their prosperity and prominence. \n\nThese are not just idle promises: now that we are directly administering our Bahari territories, we can focus our commercial efforts toward dominating trade in Bulwar and beyond. The goods and merchants of a thousand surface countries will flow through Orlghelovar, and it will arrive through Ovdal Túngr, our grandest port!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.10.a:0 "It was long overdue"

 flavor_orlghelovar.11.t:0 "Rumors of a Volcano"
 flavor_orlghelovar.11.d:0 "This week the straggling remnants of a failed dwarven adventuring party arrived at our borders. While most of their number were surface dwarves, among them was a curious traveler: a Garnet Dwarf scholar named Shaz Helmtapper, a former resident of a remnant hold in the Serpentreach called Ovdal Lodhum. He explained that he was a scholar of dwarven cultures, and had joined the adventuring party upon learning they were from other dwarven communities from the surface. \n\nUpon hearing of our own attempts to recover the glassblowing heritage of our hold, he mentioned something fascinating. Apparently, along with its famed magma-fuelled armories, the lost hold of Gor Bûrad in the far eastern edge of the Serpentreach was also famous for a different kind of craft: glassworking, with volcanic obsidian! \n\nIf this is true, securing control of this lost hold would not only secure new space for settlements, but also might open up untold scientific and commercial opportunities. Crossing the Serpentreach would, however, be a substantial undertaking. We must head east, to learn more from these remaining Garnet Dwarves, and perhaps even take the volcano for ourselves."
 flavor_orlghelovar.11.a:0 "Is there really glass on the other side?"

 flavor_orlghelovar.12.t:0 "At the Doorsteps of Gor Bûrad"
 flavor_orlghelovar.12.d:0 "As the dwarven road approaches the old hold, the straight and perfectly cut tunnel increasingly opens up as it passes through the old magma tubes deep in the volcanic heart of the east Serpentreach. Finally, the road arrives at the hold itself, and the scouting party slows. Our scout commander, Halir Firmhandle, grips the handle of her rifle and stares awestruck at her surroundings. The itinerant Garnet Dwarf scholar, Shaz Helmtapper, insisted on accompanying the expedition, and is struck equally silent, his notebook slack in his hands. \n\n‘Balgar’s hammer, there really is a volcano down here,’ Halir mutters, nudging Shaz with her elbow. The endpoint of the dwarven road is a vaulted bridge of basalt over a vast magma flow, easily a mile wide, cutting through an enormous underground gorge. The molten rock casts the surroundings in an eerie red glow, the light catching the fractured surface of veins of obsidian exposed in sections of the cliff. \n\nBeyond the bridge lies our final destination. The tell-tale fortifications, external supports and grand, reinforced door indicate an underground dwarven hold: Gor Bûrad!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.12.a:0 "The rumors were true!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.13.t:0 "Excavation"
 flavor_orlghelovar.13.d:0 "Now that we have gained control of Gor Bûrad and the surrounding caverns, we can turn our attention to the mineral wealth of the area. While our geologists are not sure why minerals occur more frequently around volcanoes – perhaps due to the movement and heat of the rock, or being carried in the currents of magma – Dwarven scholarship makes it clear that volcanoes are rich areas for mining. The system of caverns in the Zarn region has been identified by our prospectors and geologists as the most promising candidate in the area around Gor Bûrad, and initial explorations have already shown some shallow deposits of gems and minerals. Investing in more intensive mineral exploration in the area will take time and money, but the dividends could be enormous. It is time to strike the earth!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.13.a:0 "Time to mine!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.14.t:0 "Striking Sapphire"
 flavor_orlghelovar.14.d:0 "Deep in the caverns of our mineral exploration project in Zarn, a miner swings his pickaxe into the rock, only to find it shuddering to a halt. Curious, he fiddles in his belt for a smaller pick and chips away at the rock around the spot he struck, brushing dirt away with his free hand, until the light of his helmet-lamp catches on some flat, reflective surface with a tell-tale blue gleam. \n\nBy the time the foreman arrives, hurried down the tunnel with two miners at his heels, a small crowd has gathered around the tunnel section, and several lamps have been set down to light the area. What he can see is the edge of an enormous sapphire deposit, the section found in the tunnel easily as tall as a dwarf, and the beginnings of a tunnel alongside it show that it stretches much further and deeper into the earth. Even this single exposed section of sapphires would be enormously valuable, and depending on how much deeper it runs, the miners may have stumbled upon a truly massive volume of gems. \n\nOur merchants are already tallying the estimated revenues from such a deposit, and our scientists are eager to explore the refractive properties of such high-quality sapphire."
 flavor_orlghelovar.14.a:0 "Just imagine the profit margin!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.15.t:0 "Gnomish Brilliance"
 flavor_orlghelovar.15.d:0 "The Glasshammer clan and Orlghelovar’s ministry of trade have spared no expense: constructed across half a city block, the exhibition hall of the Glasshammer Fair is four storeys tall, the wall facing the street a series of stunning stained glass panels between thin vertical shafts of marble bricks. In each window, images of glassmaking from across Halann are depicted; Orlghelovar only appears in a single window, but all the images are detailed in the same uniform shade of cobalt-blue. \n\nThe exhibition is humming with activity. A group of wealthy Beepecker merchants crowd around a stall of Cobalt Dwarf table-ware, negotiating a private commission with a gray-haired dwarven glassmaker. A pair of well-dressed elven university students stare, fascinated, at a live display of glassblowing in front of a miniature furnace. It is as if our hold has gathered the whole world into this hall, to share in the beauty of our crafts! What a grand day for Orlghelovar! \n\nGrowing up in Orlghelovar, ambassador Ombric Sternforge does have a healthy appreciation for glassmaking, but she has also seen many, many variations of tableware, windows, and sculptures. Walking through the Glasshammer Fair, what draws her to the display of the Ecklebozz Company is the novelty: where other exhibitors display sculptures and goblets, the gnomish firm has instead set up a complicated array of lenses to focus light streaming in from the exterior window into a narrow beam that boils the water held within a clear glass teapot. \n\nWhat has kept her engrossed in conversation with head glassmaker Oodob Ecklebozz for the past three hours, however, is that the creativity of the gnomes is not restrained to boiling water. He explains that the funding of this kind of novel experimentation is the secret to the success of many gnomish firms and hierarchies. Where Orlghelovar has researched only methods to replicate the glassmaking of old Aul-Dwarov, Mr. Ecklebozz talks warmly of an engineer that was supported for twenty years with no results, only to eventually produce a lensed device for looking around obstacles that has seen great use in warships. \n\n"Others call it a gnomish approach," he says, "but I think it’s a choice any manager could make. There are curious people in every community. We simply give them funding, and eventually reap the rewards. Why restrain yourself to the discoveries of the past? The future is built on the back of innovation. All the colonies of Aelantir owe their existence to the invention of the humble compass. Who knows what will be the next invention to shake the world?" \n\nMany, many hours later, ambassador Ombric pens a letter to [Root.Monarch.GetName], detailing the benefits of the gnomish model of state-funded, open-ended scientific research and experimentation, and suggesting the establishment of such a research institute within Orlghelovar. One hundred years later this humble letter, displayed under glass in Orglhelovar’s State Library, is held up as one such object that shook the world."
 flavor_orlghelovar.15.a:0 "Those gnomes are intriguing"

 flavor_orlghelovar.16.t:0 "Dwarven Science"
 flavor_orlghelovar.16.d:0 "Orlghelovar achieved a reformation in their government. It is now a mercantile government, focused on science while keeping true to their roots in trading and glass. Their merchants act as spies and traders, the markets as valuable targets for new inventions and the other scientific races, especially gnomes, as partners and rivals. \n\n Some dwarves among the residents of Orlghelovar are old enough to have witnessed the original refounding of the hold. To have seen those early, tentative steps firsthand: entering through the old, long-broken gate; the crunch of shards of broken glass beneath iron-capped boots; the murmur of some errant orcish warband or the gurgling of still-flowing cisterns the only sounds to break the tomb-like silence. \n\n We have come so far since those days. The empty halls of Orlghelovar now brim with life, the voices and music and hammering of a hundred thousand citizens, a panoply of colors from the stained-glass windows of the hold and the dazzling array of imported dyes and silks. \n\n It is not enough. The old hold of Orlghelovar was wealthy, too, and this did not save it from the orcs. The world is changing faster than ever before: the refounding of the old dwarf holds; the mad rush westward, to the lost continent of the elves; the new faith of the Jadd shaking eastern Bulwar. We have only come this far by our willingness to learn. We restarted the glass-forges and re-learnt and improved upon the science of old Orlghelovar; our growing relationship with the gnomish communities in Cannor are ample evidence of the benefits of state investment into artificery and science. If we are to keep ahead of the tides of history, we must not stop here. By fully integrating our guilds’ existing industrial research into the state, we can form a new kind of government: not a technocracy dedicated solely to science, but a perfect harmony of science and commerce, each aiding in the advancement of the other. \n\n Our merchants will seek out knowledge and opportunities in foreign markets, and our scientists will seek out ever greater applications for our industrial discoveries, in homes, battlefields, and workshops alike. The future is crystal-clear!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.101.t:0 "Glass of Orlghelovar"
 flavor_orlghelovar.101.d:0 "The mood within Orlghelovar is subdued, despite our recent great reawakening - the glassworkers are growing unsatisfied with their craft. While it is undeniable that our glassworkers are the finest, it has always been this way - they have not truly innovated or been challenged for many generations, and their passions are beginning to cool. For the first time since our ancestors began making glass, we can see new scientific possibilities on the horizon.  Our gnomish scientists have already made great leaps in the study of other materials, and with their assistance we may gain a deeper understanding of glass. We must gather our greatest glassworkers and our finest minds to search for new ideas - with one spark we could revitalise the whole industry forever."
 flavor_orlghelovar.101.a:0 "Glass is the way forward!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.102.t:0 "Trader's Advice"
 flavor_orlghelovar.102.d:0 "During a meeting with the most prominent Orlghelovarian glass traders, a radical research idea was proposed - what about examining glass from outside the Serpentspine? Many in Orlghelovar decry glassworkers from other nations as backwards and misguided, but for these reasons we have never bothered to ask how they do it. Early reports from a trader loyal to us within a Bulwari glass manufactory suggest their proprietary methods are quite different to ours, and the methods used in Cannor to produce vast quantities of glass are completely opaque to us. From this, it is clear that to truly become the masters of glass, we must incorporate all discoveries in glassmaking! No matter how primitive the glassworkers of the world outside the Serpentspine may be, their techniques are still alien to us - researching these may be the spark our glassworkers need to truly perfect their craft."
 flavor_orlghelovar.102.a:0 "Maybe the surface knows."

 flavor_orlghelovar.103.t:0 "The Outside Glass"
 flavor_orlghelovar.103.d:0 "Our information gathering has borne fruit - from the myriad proprietary techniques of Halann's glassworkers, we have identified two distinct underlying methods. We have tentatively named these the "Bulwari" and "Cannorian" methods, after the location of the glassworks using them. These methods are the secret to the unique nature of each region's glass, and by analysing these we may glean the results of the many years of experimentation their workers have benefited from. However, such an endeavour will doubtlessly take yet more time - many variations on these methods are used by glassworkers of variable skill, producing glass of greatly varying quality even within each region. These extant techniques must be analysed and the merit of each determined, so that we may combine them all to produce the perfect product. \n\nWe will begin with the Bulwari. Not only are their glassworks closer in proximity to our own, but we have much stronger relations with them than the Cannorians. Furthermore, as the Bulwari were the first to learn of glassmaking from our ancestors, their glassmaking should be the most similar to ours - though of course, incomparable in quality."
 flavor_orlghelovar.103.a:0 "Bulwar was chosen by our ancestors for a reason"

 flavor_orlghelovar.104.t:0 "The Glass of Bulwar"
 flavor_orlghelovar.104.d:0 "It seems our prejudice against other glassworkers may have some merit - the glass produced by the Bulwari method cannot hold a candle to ours, even when the method is performed by our own superior craftsmen. Their methods are simply too clumsy and wasteful, borne of an abundance of resources and the near monopoly they enjoyed after our hold was first ravaged. However, within them we can see the designs of our ancestors shining through, and though their methods have been diluted by many generations of Bulwari craftsmen, their glassmaking still bears some resemblance to ours. They have clearly not forgotten our assistance in the past, as it is no coincidence that their finest glassworks are those closest to Shazstundhir. Though we may have gleaned no new insights into glass, we can now more clearly picture how our ancestors once worked - but to venerate them properly, we must ensure their methods are carried out flawlessly. To this end, we will assist the Bulwari glassworkers once more so that they may create glass our ancestors can be satisfied with. \n\nPerhaps we will find better fortune studying the Cannorian method. We will need to make preparations to send a small contingent of glassworkers to Cannor, as we have had little luck convincing them to come to us."
 flavor_orlghelovar.104.a:0 "Hopefully Cannor will not disappoint"

 flavor_orlghelovar.105.t:0 "The Glass of Cannor"
 flavor_orlghelovar.105.d:0 "Once again, our glassworkers are disappointed! The Cannorian method invariably produces glass of even lower quality than the Bulwari and it is now clear that Halann needed the guiding hand of our ancestors to produce any semi-decent glass. Nothing useful at all can be gleaned from these methods, and many of our citizens are mourning that such a noble art can be performed so barbarically. Curiously, despite the lower quality of the glass produced their glassworkers are much happier and more motivated than ours, in part due to their more relaxed working conditions and standards. The trip was not entirely a waste, though - traders in Cannor are well aware of the lower quality of their glass and have often sought higher quality pieces. Once these traders laid eyes upon the Orlghelovarian glass we had brought with us to compare, our workers were inundated with offers of purchase - with more to come in the future!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.105.a:0 "At least we made money..."

 flavor_orlghelovar.106.t:0 "The End of the Trip"
 flavor_orlghelovar.106.d:0 "Our investigators have come together to summarise the results of our research into Halann's other glassworkers. As expected, we found no improvements or insights that will directly benefit us, as our artisans are simply too practised in their craft. However, we did learn more about what makes their glassworks so prosperous despite their inferior craftsmanship. \n\nThe Bulwari emphasise knowledge sharing and learning between craftsmen, and were particularly receptive both to ours and our ancestors' assistance with glassmaking. This attitude is sorely needed within our nation, as our glassworks have long since broken down into conglomerates - rather than our finest glassworkers working with each other and our less talented, they compete and vie with each other for prestige and wealth. This appears to be an affliction mostly limited to our dwarven artisans, as our gnomish scientists are quite fanatical about cataloguing and sharing knowledge, having already produced a compendium of our finest inventions. If this fervour could be channelled into glassmaking, and our own artisans could be swept up into it, perhaps we could foster more co-operation within Orlghelovar."
 flavor_orlghelovar.106.a:0 "Even those beneath us can teach new things"

 flavor_orlghelovar.107.t:0 "Glasslord Worker Reform"
 flavor_orlghelovar.107.d:0 "Orlghelovar has been reborn anew, and our people are emboldened by our success over the hoardcursed who had slowly come to control most of our nation. Already, there are calls for even more sweeping reforms to workers rights - particularly within the glass industry, as it is both our most important and most venerated profession. With the assistance of Orlghelovar's gnomish scientists and finest advisors, we have distilled all of the research we previously conducted into Halann's glassworks and the lessons learnt from the hoardcurse into the most ambitious set of reforms ever attempted in our nation. \n\nFirstly, the glass industry will no longer be controlled by a select few. As a cornerstone of our economy, society, and culture, it is essential to Orlghelovar, and thus will be nationalised and completely owned by our administration. No longer will profits be syphoned into the pockets of the owners at the expense of the common worker. All profits from glass will be fed back into the state to fund our projects directly, and workers will receive a proportional and untaxed share of these profits, ensuring they are both incentivised to and can benefit from increased production. With the corrupt owners gone, we can standardise glass production, allowing many of the unreasonable standards and targets for glassworks to be lifted. We must be careful to prevent our workers falling into repetitive dullness, and so we will also allow the glassworkers more personal freedom to choose how and what glass they produce, so long as it meets our quality standards. \n\nWe will also foster a combination of both competition and co-operation in our workers. We will greatly incentivise the sharing of knowledge between glassworks, and sponsor artisans to lead regular workshops for our glassworkers to improve their craft. We will make leading positions within glassworks only available to those who can win a majority vote of confidence from the workers. This will both improve cohesion in the glassworks and foster healthy competition between individual workers, which will drive them to produce glass of yet greater quality. \n\nAs expected, these proposals are vehemently opposed by those they aim to deprive of power - a small but extremely influential cabal of top glasswork owners and traders who our people have dubbed the "glasslords". Despite the reforms instituted in Orlghelovar to crush monopolies and remove corruption, many of them maintained most of their power and influence by utilising their position as leaders in our foremost industry. As is common within the upper circles of dwarf kind, they are motivated only by greed and abhor change in any form. Already we have seen threats both economic and violent in nature as a response, and as we move forward with these reforms they will only grow bolder.

To attempt to restore peace, we sent officials to each glasswork to reiterate our stance for workers rights, but made the grave error of providing them with a small armed escort. At our glassworks in [Root.Capital.GetName] one of their guards overreacted, and swung at a particularly threatening worker - quickly, the protests devolved into a violent brawl, and our official barely escaped with their life. News of this incident spread, amplified by the glasslords, and now the protests have turned into open rebellion at every glassworks!

For the first time, every glassworker in every glassworks has been afforded the privileges and rights they deserve. In doing this, we have surpassed even our ancestors!". Before the crowd can celebrate, he continues "However, this joy is not felt in every corner of the nation. The glasslords have been quiet since their disastrous protests and many have gone into hiding, as you well know. I am told that once news of our accomplishment reached them, they drew all of their remaining wealth and influence to mount a final stand against the forces of progress, going as far as to hire mercenaries to support their rebellion from our neighbouring countries! As I speak, they march on [Root.Capital.GetName]". [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] pauses, letting the crowd murmur and shift, before quieting them with a gesture. Another moment, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice rings out "It is clear that they will never be satisfied with any world in which they are not in control, and so, to safeguard the future of our nation we must purge them once and for all.

 flavor_orlghelovar.110.t:0 "What is Glass?"
 flavor_orlghelovar.110.d:0 "Under the guidance of the Enlightened 10, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] was granted a sizable sum and some of our best gnomish scientists to make use of all our recent scientific breakthroughs and discover exactly what glass is. Today, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has presented [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings to the council. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] has discovered that there is much more variation in glass than we thought! Although most glass is made of the same primary material, silica, there is great variation in the structure of even visually similar glass. There are also many impurities in the glass we produce, even in pieces we thought to be near perfect. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] also studied a range of naturally occurring glass and discovered other similarities, claiming that even volcanic obsidian shares some properties with ordinary glass! With this research, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has made several breakthroughs that will directly affect how we produce glass. \n\nIn [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] study of silica, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] determined that different types of sand will produce different glass. Many artisans believed that any sand could be used to produce identical glass with varying effort, and thus no provisions were made to standardise what sand is used in our glassworks. Upon analysing sand from Bahar and from the Dameshead, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] discovered that though they are both comprised mostly of silica they each have different levels of impurities that cannot be removed by simple sifting and filtering - these are the cause of much of the variation between regional glass. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] also identified some inexpensive materials which can be added while heating to remove many of these impurities, as well as some that improve other properties like tensile strength or corrosion resistance. With this revelation we can produce better specialised glass for different uses; no longer will we use the same method to produce glass for a window and glass for a heating flask! \n\n[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] also examined the processes used in our glassworks with [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] new knowledge of the structure of glass. Ordinarily, glassworkers lay molten glass to cool on great sheets of solid iron. Glass cooled this way is often uneven and always blemishes on the side touching the iron and so must be polished after the cooling is complete, wasting both time and material. On the suggestion of a gnomish scientist with experience in metallurgy, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] devised a new method where molten glass "floats" upon a bed of molten metal to cool. If the metal chosen is one that will not mix with molten glass, such as tin, then the glass formed will be perfectly smooth and unblemished without any polishing. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] has also drawn up a set of quality assurance tests to perform on our glass. These tests are extensive, going beyond the simple hammer and eye methods of our ancestors. In particular, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has devised an ingenious use of polarised light, which will display coloured streaks in any glass with remaining impurities. These tests will ensure our glass is of sufficient quality, but also allow us to quantify exactly what properties our glass has to better market it to our customers."

What fire also produces, however, is heat, smoke, ash, and grime. What we need is a more pure light. In order to achieve this, our artificers are not heating up flammable material, but very small amounts of a metal alloy. Being heated to just under its melting point by the damestear, the alloy produces a very large amount of light. Besides allowing the damestear to last much longer, this also produces no smoke or grime, meaning that the devices do not need to be cleaned to retain their shine.

In other words: while we often know *how* magic works, we rarely know *why* it works. It limits its use on a very fundamental level. And at the core of it, of course, is azhalngiv, what the Cannorians know as damestear. It empowers our runes, and in turn, our artefacts. Beyond this, it is the primary driving force behind the power of the mages, who by and large are unaccountable and virtually impossible to regulate. For this reason, we intend to fund much more research into azhalngiv itself."

If they have to keep working at this pace, they claim, research is going to take several lifetimes. Attempts to import azhalngiv from abroad have resulted in very little, and existing deposits cannot be effectively mined faster without serious safety risks. In order to secure the large amounts of azhalngiv we need, they request that we limit its use for other projects: by levying a harsh tax on the use of azhalngiv for purposes not related to research, they claim, we can ensure the supply remains large enough for the quantities needed for research."

Our advisors, however, disagree vehemently about what exactly needs to change. Some demand retribution: the mages were fundamentally disloyal to Orlghelovar, and should not expect to be welcome still. They should be exiled for what they have done. Others, however, argue quite the opposite. The protests and the rebellion have shown just how reliant we actually are on the mages. We should elevate their position above the scientists, and ensure that we are not put into this position again. A small number of advisors, however, see a third path. They believe the root of the problem lies in the division between the scientists and the mages, and want to restructure the council on a fundamental level. Research and practice of magic, they argue, must intertwine, lest we either lose sight of progress or lose our grounding in reality.

It's obvious that the glass should be paired with a metal for structural, ergonomic, and economic reasons, but how? Two craftsmen have come to the council with their ideas: \n\nThe first, a glass expert by the name of Brokkr, who helped develop Sapphire Glass, proposes armor made of sheets of Glass, which are held to each other by a framing of mild steel. This reliance on glass means they will need thick sheets, which could have drawbacks. However, the steel is cheap, and the glassworkers are confident their new material can outclass metal in almost every aspect. Besides, this gives the dwarves that brought us our new glass a chance to continue working for the state. \n\nThe second idea comes from a young apprentice by the name of Grunhilt. She would like to fabricate a suit of armor out of thin sheets of mithril, which then have plates of Sapphire glass adhered to them as an extra shell.

In particular, Gram Glassgrinder provided us with the location of the branch housing the ringleaders and blueprints for their improvised defensive mechanisms in exchange for only our promise to retrieve his magnification prototype. Using this and other knowledge gleaned from their victims, we positioned small detachments of elite soldiers outside every artificer branch we knew to have ties to the extorting cartels. At dawn, we struck - moving swiftly we apprehended the leaders of each society and pacified the members with little resistance, allowing them no time to use their ad-hoc defensive contraptions and without spilling a drop of blood. \n\nWhat we found within was staggering - evidence of not only a coordinated and extremely profitable extortion operation targeting hundreds of our scientists, but plans to stage an open rebellion and wrest control of state research from the Enlightened 10! Once all those indicted by this evidence were safely on their way to our jails, we kept our promises and began restoring the cartel's victims to the newly vacant positions. Without Gram Glassgrinder's information we could not have completed this operation bloodlessly, and accordingly we kept our promise with him too and allowed him a personal detachment of guards to search for his stolen invention. It was quickly found being used as a paperweight on the desk of a longtime rival of Glassgrinder's and returned to him mostly intact. Now he asks only that we grant him time to finish refining his invention, which he has named a "microscope", and we are all too happy to oblige."

Each time he appeared noticeably more ragged than before, with new scars, burn marks and minor lacerations abundant on his calloused hands and weary face. He was always jittery, constantly scanning the room with his bloodshot eyes and jumping at sudden footsteps from retainers. It was evident to all present that he had been working himself to the bone on the invention, but not why. Each time his demands increased too, culminating in requests for armed guards to protect his supposed invention! Curiously, despite this week being scheduled for annual research progress presentations, he did not reappear as usual. \n\nHe is not the only person missing, though. Throughout the week, the scientists and inventors of Orlghelovar should have been preparing to present their finest research and newest discoveries before the council. Invitations were sent to all prominent figures and everything seemed to be proceeding as normal. Now unease has begun to settle over the council, as less than a third of those invited have attended! Even those scientists that have arrived are uncooperative and many have brought no research or demonstrations at all. All profess ignorance as to why the other attendees are missing, and a group of prominent artificers have sequestered themselves in a side ballroom and are ignoring all summons from our guards. \n\nNot yet understanding the gravity of the situation, we had dispatched officials to retrieve and question the wayward scientists. Now, a messenger bursts into the hall - ‘Rebellion!’ they cry breathlessly. All over Orlghelovar, artificers have banded together and resisted the officials, at first diplomatically but then with force. At several prominent artificer societies those inside have taken up arms and declared in no uncertain terms that the Enlightened 10 must capitulate and surrender complete control of state research and funding to them! At this news, the artificers inside rushed from the ballroom and attempted to take control of the council hall with hastily assembled weapons! Luckily one of the few inventions actually brought to the council was a prototype crowd suppression weapon, and with the quick thinking of the inventor all the perpetrators were captured with minimal casualties. There will be time to interrogate them and investigate the matter later, for now we must swiftly put down these revolts lest they spread further! "

Among those kidnapped were Gram Glassgrinder, the gnome who we now realise was likely attempting to warn us about the upcoming rebellions with his strange behaviour and demands at the council.

After all involved were arrested and destined for a long stay in our prisons, we began the arduous process of returning the inventions and relocating the scientists. One familiar face among these scientists, Gram Glassgrinder, has asked that we do him a favour to repay him for not trusting him in his time of need. He asks for one more attempt to create the new magnification device the council had been seeking before this whole debacle.

Today, every state artificery member around Orlghelovar, regardless of their participation in the planned revolt, awoke to find their attendance mandatory in a meeting with the local officials - with soldiers stationed as peacekeepers in each of our holds to ensure the proceedings go smoothly. In these meetings the new code of law and standards devised by the council was put to them, with each member given the choice of complying in perpetuity or being stripped of their position and barred from practising artificery in Orlghelovar again. As expected, despite the tension and distrust very few members have chosen to leave their positions. Under the new laws, all artificers must submit detailed proposals and receive approval directly from the council for all research conducted. Additionally, the possession and distribution of artificery tools and inventions has been limited severely, and possession of them without a licence or valid research grant entails a hefty fine. Lastly, the Enlightened 10 have installed their own loyal representatives as the head of each major artificer branch, and provided state-accredited accountants to ensure all funding and income will be tracked - no longer will dwarven greed hinder critical research. With these steps, artificers throughout Orlghelovar have been thoroughly restricted and reduced to mere tools of the state to be used for the betterment of our nation, rather than greedy middlemen extorting their fellows.

It is modular, allowing a user to easily adjust the magnification and focus of the image by slotting in different lenses - he has even provided a portable version that fits in a monocle, sure to be a hit with workers who commonly have their hands full. Before the council and a group of assembled craftsmen and traders, he scoured the floor of the grand cavern and easily located the miniscule carved rune. Such was the power of his microscope that he correctly identified that the rune was carved using two tools of different bore and length by examining the strokes left in the rock! He has been appointed a position at the forefront of our council, and given free reign to oversee the production of the precisely manufactured lenses needed for these microscopes. With this invention, we stand poised to revolutionise many aspects of science - already we have fielded research proposals for the examination of vegetation, volcanic rock, azhalngiv and dwarven flesh. We can only imagine what new knowledge this might bring, but we can be certain that once again Orlghelovar's position at the forefront of science has been magnified."

 flavor_orlghelovar.146.d:0 "With newfound cooperation between mages and scientists, we have discovered a wealth of the secrets and peculiarities of magic, normally closely guarded by jealous mages. While we are spoilt for choice with offensive uses for magic on the battlefield, there is very little capable of protecting our common soldiers from a mage assault. Research into wards and magic fields revealed them to be somewhat effective, but far too costly and fragile to deploy at a high-level across entire armies. After many failed research proposals and much wasted state funds, just when the council had begun to give up hope, an erstwhile merchant spy of ours by the name of Galin Karnoris entered the council chamber and asked for an audience with the Enlightened 10. Once he was granted it, he spun a wild and obviously embellished tale of his journey across the remains of the Golden Highway. \n\nApparently, while resting in a tavern in Azka-Sur after single-handedly fighting off a lich-king and a storm elemental, he heard an intriguing story. At the bar, a drunken Raheni mage was ranting to anyone who would listen about the "savage beasts from the Command". Apparently, the mage was forced to flee his home to avoid the Command's persecution of mages. Ordinarily he would have crushed their armies with a sweep of his hand, but the hobgoblins possessed some material capable of nullifying magic, rendering normally formidable warrior mages easy pickings for their forces. Karnoris approached him, and after a few more rounds the mage offered to sell him a piece of this material for an exorbitant price, far more than Karnoris was carrying! Recalling that the Enlightened 10 were promising great compensation to anyone who could provide information on how to counter mages, he promptly rushed to the banks of Azka-Sur and took out as many loans as he could. Scraping together just barely enough, he returned to the tavern and purchased the material from the now rather sober mage. \n\nIt is this material which Karnoris proudly presents to the Enlightened 10. It's a solid black crystal, roughly polished and shaped into a neat cylinder. It bears many resemblances to volcanic obsidian, but Karnoris insists it is different entirely. Actually, a quick examination reveals it is in fact just simple obsidian. Even the centre has been hollowed out to cheat Karnoris out of as much material as possible! Still, Karnoris insists there must be some truth to the rumours and begs us to investigate. Though we certainly won't compensate him for his foolish purchase, we will at least do our due diligence and mobilise some of our spies to search for any further rumours of this material in Azka-Sur."

 flavor_orlghelovar.147.d:0 "Galin Karnoris sits in the council chamber with a self-satisfied smirk as one of our merchant spies gives their report. While posing as a trader in Azka-Sur they were approached by several human traders, dwarves and even a goblin, all who claimed to have access to a mythical substance known as "korashi". This korashi was the substance that Karnoris believed he was buying. It can apparently nullify magic in even tiny amounts and is the secret to the Command's subjugation of Haless' many warrior-mages. Korashi was once made near-exclusively in the towering mountains of the Demon Hills by the monstrous Oni and sold to the Command in exchange for peace. The Oni have since been subjugated by the Command and their korashi secrets extracted, allowing the Command to ramp up korashi production. All of Haless now knows of this substance, wielded by the fearsome Command to nullify their strongest warriors. Stories of korashi spread as rumours down the golden highway, finding opportunists willing to exploit gullible traders by selling fake korashi. \n\nOur spy met these opportunists in the midst of their scam, many already weighed down with crowns from successful sales. Being more careful than Karnoris, the spy attempted to weed out any running a scam with direct questions. They first inquired about the process by which korashi is made and received many different answers. Some refused to say at all, but some gave obviously ridiculous answers like two parts mithril one part gold, that it is the soul of a dead god, or even that it comes from meteorites! They also disagreed on the appearance of korashi beyond that it is black, claiming that it is crystalline, a powder, or even pure energy. In the end, the spy purchased a few samples from more convincing sellers to bring back for testing - they were all obsidian or powdered slate, completely worthless. \n\nWith just a small quantity of korashi, our unparalleled scientists could surely reverse engineer the secrets of its production. If we cannot obtain korashi with gold or honeyed words, we have no choice but to take it by force! Plundering korashi from the facilities deep in the Demon Hills is impossible, but luckily the Command's newer production facilities and korashi supply lines present easier targets. Even so, the Command is well aware of the value of korashi and will defend it to the last hobgoblin. Even discovering their korashi routes will be difficult, let alone organising an untraceable raid halfway across Halann. We will need to plan meticulously and execute perfectly to have even the tiniest chance of obtaining korashi without incurring the wrath of the Command."

 flavor_orlghelovar.148.d:0 "After one of the most complex secret missions ever undertaken in Orlghelovar, our spies have managed to infiltrate the Command and detect korashi being transported to the front lines of Haless in great caravan lines. These caravans are defended by thousands of heavily armoured hobgoblins - these guards will not be caught slacking off or deserting their duties. Even worse, they depart at apparently random times, and they're always combined with caravans carrying spoils of war, precious metals or other valuables. Determining korashi caravans from regular supply lines is difficult enough, let alone predicting the time of future korashi deliveries. Instead, we waited for a sufficiently large rebellion against the Command, one which would necessitate a large amount of korashi. They cannot afford sparse deliveries in such a situation and will need a constant supply, and thus near constant caravans of korashi. Our spies have just now informed us that just such a rebellion is threatening to arise on the edges of the Command's borders, and that they are already moving more korashi in preparation. \n\nTo assault the korashi caravans, a legion of our finest soldiers stands at the ready, already briefed and having been preparing for this operation for months. They will follow the Dwarvorod as far as they can, disguised as a supply shipment, before crossing into hobgoblin land and evading their diligent patrols as best they can until they reach the Shamakhad. Their target is a mountain pass that the hobgoblins often use to conceal their korashi deliveries from the surrounding area. This mountain will be used against them, acting as a chokepoint and allowing our army to wipe out their guards and take the korashi. \n\nIf the Command uncovers our involvement in this raid, they will declare war on us without hesitation. Only our most loyal soldiers have been chosen for the operation, and mercenaries are out of the questions owing to their variable loyalties. Our soldiers bear no insignia and wear plain uniforms in Raheni style, concealing their affiliation with us. Unfortunately, concealing our soldiers' dwarven nature is much harder. Fighting the Command on stilts to imitate humans is obviously impossible, so luckily we have scapegoats in Haless itself. Near enough all of Haless desires korashi and detests the Command, and many dwarves from the Tree of Stone and the Jade Mines fled to Haless when their holds fell. The Command will naturally suspect these dwarven minorities, supported by the mountain king of Verkal Ozovar or even the exilarch of Grôzumdihr, of carrying out the attack. The Command's retribution against them is likely to be brutal, but our brethren must suffer for the sake of science."

He made the mistake of tagging along with the korashi raid, hoping to gain favour back with the Enlightened 10 to encourage them to pay off the debt he amassed on fake korashi. Instead, he has front row seats to the bloody and desperate battle over the korashi caravans. As he hides beneath an armoured caravan, rocked by artillery fire and pierced by screams, he thinks back on what went wrong.\n\nAt first, everything seemed to be going just as planned. The army made it to the mountain pass in Shamakhad undetected and unharmed, hunkering down to wait for a korashi caravan. No more than three hours later, a korashi caravan travelled through the mountain pass and was quickly ambushed by our waiting soldiers. Here, everything began to fall apart. Despite being outnumbered, outgunned and outmanoeuvred the hobgoblins held on. They held on for so long that a returning hobgoblin squadron heard the cries and explosions from the mountainside and rushed to defend their kin, crushing the rear of the army in a surprise charge and ruining the pincer attack. \n\nNow all hope seems lost as the remains of our army are routed, battling desperately now to flee the mountain that is rapidly turning into their grave. Steeling his nerves, Karnoris darts out from underneath the caravan and straight towards the mountainside. As he desperately clambers up the mountainside to escape the slaughter, a stray artillery shell strikes the armoured caravan he was previously sheltering under. An eerie screeching echoes down the mountain pass as korashi crystals rain from above. Scarcely believing his luck, Karnoris scoops up as many as he can carry on his way up the mountain and continues to flee, leaving the sounds of battle far behind."

In the worst case, failure could lead not only to not obtaining any korashi, but to a war with the military juggernaut of Haless. A missive from the captain of the korashi raid was expected days ago and the mood in the room is dark, as many entertain the possibility that the operation has failed. Suddenly, a familiar face bursts into the room. Galin Karnoris has returned, scorched and bedraggled, clearly exhausted. In his hands he carries a rough sack full of black crystals. He is accompanied by several mage guards who insist on escorting him, unsettled by the crystals. Apparently, they have a very peculiar effect on mages. Not only does close proximity cause nausea and unease, they also perceive them quite differently. To them, the crystals are not just black but almost completely devoid of light, more akin to a void than a crystal. Karnoris is absolutely adamant that this time he has brought korashi and this time the Enlightened 10 are inclined to believe him. Still, to uphold the rigours of science they must at least conduct an experiment to verify his claims. \n\nAs mages and council members watch nervously, a small piece of the supposed korashi is chiselled off and stabbed into the palm of a mage volunteer. Immediately, he complains of dizziness and nausea. He is also completely unable to cast spells - even simple blasts of air and tiny lights elude him while pierced by the korashi, and even after he drops the shard he remains unable to cast anything for several hours. The decision from the Enlightened 10 is unanimous - Galin Karnoris has finally delivered the korashi they seek. Karnoris leaves hours later with a spring in his step, several debts lighter. \n\nImmediately, the scientific study of korashi begins. It is quickly determined that it is almost identical to azhalngiv in composition but has an inverse effect, draining mana instead of providing it. This led several of our influential scientists to posit that korashi is produced from azhalngiv, sparking a flurry of questionably safe experiments aiming to replicate it. After a few days of chaos, a gnome has managed to vacuum most of the mana out of a chunk of azhalngiv without the usual catastrophic side effects. Though his method was violent enough to collapse the structure of the crystal, producing a fine black powder rather than a black crystal, the resulting material behaves as a weaker form of the korashi we obtained from the raid. Now that we have replicated it ourselves, we need only time to improve upon it. With science on our side, we will do in mere years what took the Oni generations."

Through various means, our team of dedicated scientists had come up with similar theories on how to conserve energy. What they came up with was a casing made of a specific material which had similar properties to magically empowered items. Items that may come to mind are the scepters of mages, which can be made of various materials, but usually are glass.

Do our ancestors frown upon us? This will be a weight on us since we are the makers of such a thing. At the "celebration party" a lead scientist on the development of the cannon, declared that it would now be Orlghelovars job and utmost priority to keep this technology from the hands of those willing to use it for evil. The room nodded silently in agreement."

 flavor_orlghelovar.203.d:0 "Over the last century, warfare changed drastically. Battles moved from being fought sword in hand to ranged combat with big cannons or smaller firearms. All of this was the concentrated effort of scientists researching new weapons on a daily basis, and Orlghelovar is not that different. \nOrlghelovar’s armies are already partially equipped with new armors, able to withstand bullets, and new , devastating weapons. Sadly, both of those inventions are impractical for wider usage as of now; however, the direction is clear as our fine glass. To keep Orlghelovar sharp, we will start investing in researching how those inventions could be made available for the wider army. \n\nFor this purpose, the Enlightened 10 created a dedicated area for military research in the Orlghelovar Science Center. Currently it is small compared to the gigantic science division as a whole, but it will continue to grow in size to conduct large scale tests on new weapons and armours and ensure the production methods will be as efficient as possible."

 flavor_orlghelovar.204.t:0 "The Start of something New"
 flavor_orlghelovar.204.d:0 "In the chaos of the Serpent's Rot we abandoned our scientific principles. Instead of conducting repeatable experiments and clinical trials of possible cures, we believed in every kind of half-baked idea and desperate theory. We had no infrastructure to deal with the masses of victims, no way to track the spread of the disease accurately, and worst of all, nobody to analyse why the rot spread so swiftly and so destructively. The devastation wrought by the Serpent's Rot cannot be allowed to reoccur - we must be better than this. That is why today the Enlightened 10 have announced plans for a new and innovative project taking place in Arg-Ôrdstun, the construction of a dedicated Centre of Dwarven Medicine. Once complete, the finest medical scientists, alchemists and doctors in Orlghelovar will be relocated to positions inside the new facility and put to work immediately. Their first task will be to determine what caused the Serpent's Rot, and their next task will be to prevent it ever happening again. In the future, the facility will serve to research all diseases and ailments, new and old, that may affect dwarfkind. Although we have made many advances in other fields, a unified and scientific theory that explains why we suffer from diseases and infections still eludes us. It is the hope of the Enlightened 10 that this investigation into the Serpent's Rot will provide the foundation for just such a theory, and that eventually we may eliminate the threat of disease altogether! \n\nTo begin our investigation into the Rot, we will need the Centre of Dwarven Medicine to be fully operational and access to the Serpent's Cave. As far as we know, the Rot began from the cave - the progenitor of the Rot may still be present, whether it is magical or mundane. The prime suspect is that for which the rot was named, the Serpent's corpse lying at the bottom of the cave, but we cannot jump to conclusions yet. Once our scientists have examined the area and taken samples from the cave and the serpent itself, the great investigation will commence. In parallel with the investigation into the Serpent's Cave, the Enlightened 10 have greenlit a knowledge gathering operation to determine if any other nation has made progress in the study of diseases. A delegation of doctors will travel around Halann, searching to see if any other nation has made progress in the study of diseases."
 flavor_orlghelovar.204.a:0 "Proceed with the preparations!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.205.t:0 "Investigating the Origin"
 flavor_orlghelovar.205.d:0 "As our scientists near the Serpent's Cave, the effects of the Rot become more and more noticeable in the surroundings. Even now there are still derelict dwellings, unlit forges and abandoned supply trains in what were once thriving communities. In the area surrounding the cave itself, there are still the telltale signs of a mass exodus as those who were healthy enough fled with all they could carry. Belongings and keepsakes are strewn around haphazardly and a grim forest of ash-covered pyres lines the roads. One of the few known attributes of the Rot is that it was airborne, and so as the scientists approach the cave they don hermetically sealed masks and suits prepared by our artificers, connected to pumps that draw air from a safe reservoir located far outside the cave. Each scientist is also attached to a sturdy rope leading outside, where a backup team waits with doses of the cure to pull them out at the first sign of danger. \n\nCarefully, the team makes their way down the unstable shaft towards the cave. The once wondrous cave was mostly destroyed in the huge earthquake which precipitated the beginning of the Rot. However, our initial surveys suggested a small channel left in the rubble may lead into the original lake - the scientists are to make their way as far as they can, taking samples of anything of note. The tunnel is partially submerged and lined with crushed bioluminescent plants oozing a glowing paste, samples of which are dutifully taken and passed back up the rope. As the rocks grow sharper and more debris blocks their way, the team pauses to clear them away and place supports to hold the rubble in place - they cannot afford to have their suits punctured or they will need to return immediately. After hours of shuffling forwards and clearing rubble the floor suddenly drops out into the lake proper. In a stroke of amazing luck, the remains of what appears to be the tail segment of the Serpent lie directly beneath! Using an extendable pole tipped with a pincer, they gather samples of the serpents remaining skin, bone, and the sediment beneath it, as well as a few samples of the weakly glowing water. Then, they pull twice on the rope to signify their mission is complete, and begin the long shuffle backwards to the camp. \n\nOnce the samples are safely back in Arg-Ôrdstun, they will be categorised, analysed and closely examined using our ever-useful microscopes for any abnormalities or similarities to samples from those killed by the Rot."
 flavor_orlghelovar.205.a:0 "Hopefully the samples will prove useful"

 flavor_orlghelovar.206.t:0 "Visit in Cannor"
 flavor_orlghelovar.206.d:0 "As the cave samples are being categorised and studied at the Centre for Dwarven Medicine, a delegation of our doctors has returned from a knowledge gathering mission at the alchemists guild in the city of Varainé, famous for their potions and herbal remedies. \n\nThe alchemists of Varainé were unfailingly friendly and cooperative with our doctors, even mixing a tincture to alleviate the head doctor's arthritis for no charge at all. Unfortunately, like most nations the delegation has visited, they had little to offer of the knowledge we seek. While their extensive herbal library and generations of alchemy experience offer fantastical insight into diagnosing and curing the symptoms of a patient, they are mostly unconcerned with what caused the symptoms in the first place. Many alchemists treat the body as an impenetrable system that is too complicated to understand fully and attempt the much easier task of controlling the outputs of the body, the symptoms of a disease. This method is effective in the short term per patient, but unsatisfactory in the long term and contrary to our scientific principles. \n\nWe had also hoped that they may have insight into the White Pestilence which once ravaged Cannor as the Serpent's Rot ravaged the Serpentspine, but here again they came up short. They knew no more than the average Cannorian peasant on this matter, that the Pestilence was a magical disease perpetuated by an evil Lich. This is of no use to us, particularly because our scientists have already ruled out the Rot acting upon or with magical energy - it is a distinctly mundane disease. With their disappointment only slightly alleviated by the free potion samples the Varainéy provided in lieu of the knowledge we wanted, the delegation begins the preparation for yet more journeys in the name of science."

 flavor_orlghelovar.207.t:0 "Studying the Sample"
 flavor_orlghelovar.207.d:0 "Norimbur Glassbeard is hard at work in the Centre of Dwarven Medicine, examining a sample of the Serpent's corpse under his high-resolution microscope. When the samples were first brought to the Centre there was much excitement and theorising from the doctors, each eager to prove their own theory of disease. As time went on, most of these theories were disproved - diseases do not generate spontaneously from dead matter, nor are they caused only by foul odours or negative emotions. The one theory that remains viable is as ancient as the rest, the idea that somewhere in the air there exists tiny particles that cause disease when inhaled. Many had thought with the advent of the microscope these particles would be found immediately, but the microscope instead revealed such a wealth of new tiny structures, particles and organisms that it has been nearly impossible to categorise them all, let alone determine if any of them can cause disease. The knowledge gathering mission was likewise a failure, only highlighting how all of Halann comforts themselves by treating the symptoms and ignoring the causes. \n\nGlassbeard has his own, somewhat radical, theory. In his opinion, diseases can only increase and decrease in severity depending on how many of the disease-causing particles are present in the body. Even in safe environments, those with a disease still grow sicker over time. Thus, the particles must be in some measure alive and capable of reproduction. He searched the sediment, rocks and water fruitlessly for anything that moved or reproduced, but anything that was once alive died in the choking dust and low oxygen of the collapsed cave. Today he finally gets his lucky break - in this section of the decomposing Serpent, rich in nutrients and mixed with the weakly glowing cave water, he observes tiny rods swimming around. As time goes on, these rods divide in two, then each half regrows and divides again, and so on at a shockingly fast rate. As he begins to worry they may never stop reproducing they die just as quickly, creating a microscopic wasteland before his very eyes. \n\nHurriedly, he takes another sample of the rods and this time introduces the Serpent's cure to it. Immediately, the rods stop splitting - this is ironclad proof of his theory! The rapid reproduction explains how such microscopic beings can become a life-threatening problem so quickly. Unfortunately, the rods are killed by many other mundane substances and even enough pure water can kill them. Could something so fragile really survive in the sturdy body of a dwarf? Through the night, he continues working. He vows to himself that the one to finally crack the mystery of the Rot will be Norimbur Glassbeard!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.207.a:0 "One step closer to the solution"

 flavor_orlghelovar.208.t:0 "The Solution"
 flavor_orlghelovar.208.d:0 "In his office at the Centre of Dwarven Medicine, Norimbur Glassbeard muses on diseases under candlelight. Covering the walls and floor around him are sketches of his microscopic observations and jars of various jellies and liquids perch precariously on stone shelves. On his desk sits a response from the Enlightened 10 regarding his theory of disease. He posited the Rot was caused by the tiny rods he observed, which he named blothgoblins for their rapid breeding and movement, desire to invade places they shouldn't be in, and most of all for their tendency to kill dwarves. The council agreed he had discovered an organism of great interest, but thought he did not successfully prove these had caused the Rot. Indeed, though he had found similar organisms he had not been able to find these specific blothgoblins in any living dwarf, as all who had the rot were either dead and burned or wholly cured. His attempts to find acceptance for his theory outside of Orlghelovar were even less successful, being greeted with ridicule and derision. Indeed, many other dwarven nations have already rationalised the Rot as magical punishment from their ancestors for allowing the Serpentspine to be invaded all those years ago. \n\nGlassbeard knows if he only had a person with the Rot before him, he could isolate living blothgoblins from their blood. With an audible crack, he sits up ramrod straight in his chair as an idea strikes him. He has already succeeded in isolating blothgoblins from the original samples and growing them in large jars of broth made from the Serpent's corpse. If he was to ingest blothgoblins from these stores and develop the symptoms of the Serpent's Rot, would that not finally prove his theory? As he prepares to rush to the lab and recruit some doctors for his experiment, he stops to scribble a quick will exhorting his descendants to continue his research. It matters not if this experiment kills him, so long as it saves many other dwarves in the future. However, if his sacrifice is not to be in vain then the world must know of it and its consequences. He will need the support of the Enlightened 10 to publicise his study and what it will mean for science, and to convince nations from all Halann to finally take notice."

 flavor_orlghelovar.209.t:0 "The Reason We Suffer"
 flavor_orlghelovar.209.d:0 "Norimbur Glassbeard sits on a comfortable bed, surrounded by doctors and journalists in protective gear. His resolve to prove his theory by experimenting on himself won over the Enlightened 10, and they sent diplomats all over Halann to publicise this great feat of Orlghelovarian heroism. It seems that all the world is waiting for the results of this final study, and many nations have sent journalists to document the whole process. Five hours ago he ingested the Rot blothgoblins he cultured from the Serpent's corpse and aside from some nausea from the repulsive mixture he feels completely normal. As the head doctor begins drawing blood for the hourly test, Glassbeard notes that his throat and neck have begun to itch. The application of a topical cream does nothing to abate the itching and an angry red rash quickly spreads across his body. The doctors are in favour of giving him the cure now, but he insists on waiting longer - the more symptoms of the Rot he presents, the more credible his theory is. Exactly seven hours and 18 minutes after ingestion, he vomits a mixture of blood and ale. His condition rapidly worsens and he is seized by tremors and stabbing pains across his chest. Finally, after almost two more hours of agony, he consents to receive the cure intravenously. Just as expected, his condition rapidly improves and at the fourteen hour mark the head doctor declares his condition is now stable. \n\nTwo weeks later, Glassbeard is present before the Enlightened 10 to receive his reward. For his selfless determination and scientific spirit he is named a member of the council and head of a new field of science - the study of blothgoblins. He has almost completely recovered aside from some lasting discoloration to his face and weakness of the legs. As he had expected, the samples of his blood contained increasing numbers of Rot blothgoblins up until the cure was taken, whereupon they rapidly decreased. As of last week the Rot blothgoblins are no longer present in his blood and he was declared non-contagious. His daring study caused quite a stir and a flurry of research. Already several other types of blothgoblins have been identified as the cause of various ailments, and surprisingly the Serpent's cure has proven to be effective in eradicating some of these too. It appears that the Pristine Fungus produces a substance capable of preventing some blothgoblins from reproducing, so great farms have been set up to mass produce this substance for medical use. The doctors of Orlghelovar are now renowned for their knowledge and care and the Centre of Dwarven Medicine has opened an expensive clinic to study new diseases in living dwarves. The unscientific assumptions surrounding diseases have been eradicated once and for all, as hopefully all diseases will be!"

Left a ruin by unchecked volcanic activity and the ravages of the orcs and goblins, we must restore this place and reclaim it for dwarfkind. Our scouts have already reported large obsidian deposits in the vicinity: a perfect opportunity to re-establish dwarven industry at the end of the Argrod."

Channeled magma, once used to smelt ore and metal, is now used to cheaply and efficiently melt glass and fuel furnaces. The black rus and airborne ash from the molten rock give this glass an intriguing black shimmer.

To guide this process, we will establish the Cobalt Research Institute, open to any citizen willing to learn and contribute to the future of our society. The most prestigious scientists will be placed on a council of the Enlightened, charged with supervising the research of their fellow scientists and cooperating with the state to ensure research is shepherded in directions beneficial to the future of Orlghelovar. \n\nWith this council established, we can begin creating research projects in the fields we are most interested in!"

If we are to make these trade routes accessible to the surface races, they need to be well-lit. That is where our artificers come in; they have been working on a new prototype lighting device, powered by a damestear core, that is able to produce light to pierce the darkness of the caverns of the Serpentreach.
