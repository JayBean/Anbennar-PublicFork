  gotiriei_pilgrimage.1.d:0 "Today, I test myself against The Rigoti. I will not be alone in this pilgrimage to the Stairway of Kings at the mountain’s peak, for I am accompanied by my most loyal and deserving guards and retainers, together with a few fellow pilgrims who seek the blessing of the Last True King.\n\nMy trials, visions, and insights, however, shall be mine and mine alone. It is a King’s burden and privilege alike to take the inward journey alongside the outward, a crucible of both spirit and body.\n\nI, galvanized by the will of the Last True King, swear upon my crown and my people that all which I recount within this testament is the solemn truth. May those who come after me find it of use in their own journeys."

  gotiriei_pilgrimage.3.d:0 "The journey has only just started and I can already feel my feet ache uncomfortably with each step up the mountain. At the very least, there is a cold breeze soothing the growing pain in my feet. As I strain on I can see fellow guards and retainers all heaving their way up the mountain together, but not all at an equal pace, halting our progression. I also spot that the few outsider pilgrims accompanying us are also struggling up this massive mountain. I could command the troops to slow down the pace for our troops to strain themselves less during the trip. Yet looking at these strangers struggle beside us, I realize that they have been able to keep up pace despite not being as well prepared as we were! Perhaps this is what the shepherd who became the first Riei had to choose between in the past? Tending my own flock's needs or keeping up with his fellow shepherds? As a ruler my resources are not limitless. Shall I dedicate myself to strengthening my country for a united future or shall I focus outwards, forging ties and alliances so we carry each other towards a brighter future?"

Nevertheless, I take a deep breath and continue marching up the base of Rigoti. I am accompanied by my loyal guards and retainers, trusted believers. Alongside our excursion, there are a few pilgrims traveling alone. They are testing their faith, though a few look just as tired as I am. Despite all their hardships, they manage to keep a smile upon their face. We chat a while and I discover that the pilgrims are new converts, whose lives were changed thanks to conversion and seeing the path of righteousness. My own priests and shamans pull me aside after hearing this and tell me that our policy of forced conversion has clearly been working. The lone group of pilgrims, overhearing this, tell me that it was by their own volition that they converted to the faith.\n\nThis conflict between forced conversion and simply spreading the truth brings conflict to my soul. If people don’t see the light, then how will they prosper, and how can this kingdom of the true faith maintain its righteousness? And yet, these converts saw the light on their own… should I focus upon my people, being an example of a leader and ruler to keep us true and united or should I use my power to enlighten the many other people in and outside my realm of the true faith?"

Their tired conversations come as a surprise to me; the soldiers start to argue that the security of the land is best dealt with by removing any external threats. The retainers don't stay idle either, many arguing back to look for support and ally with other nations around us, They claim that there is no need to spill blood. Just before I can voice my opinion, a few remaining retainers speak out. They state that before we deal with any wars or external issues, we need to settle the order and issues within our lands first and foremost. The journey barely just started and I am beset with issues from my own land. Which path should I choose? What kind of Ruler shall I be for my people?"

The more I look at the ocean the more my mind sinks into its depths. Being so high up this mountain I can already see visions - visions of a sturdy massive navy guarding our seas from any foes and pirates, an unshaking bulwark against all threats from the outside. But on the other side I see among the clouds of potential our flags waving through every port and harbor across this earth, being renowned everywhere for our goods and trade. A massive trade fleet with a massive treasury. My mind slowly fades into thoughts of the sea, as I begin to wonder..."

Down at the base of the mountain I can see several regiments of my army, tiny squares from this distance. This is the mighty army that protects this land from all kinds of threats. Looking at the clouds and the peak, I can imagine the forms of the Last True King and his army standing up tall with pride and experience. Can my armies match The Last True King´s armies? Will it end in a never-ending storm or will the skies clear to reveal my men all bloodied and dead? No! No, I need to make sure that my armies will push through everything, to stand up against any challenge! I shall inspire them to fight to the last breath, I shall fight to the last breath! No! I shall train an army of undefeatable soldiers! With a deep breath of air I come back to my senses, but I know that I need to decide upon one path before facing The Last True King upon the peak."

These people, the little specks I see now, are my subjects. The land below me is mine, the Riei, soldier of the Last True King. I ponder upon my lands, I look off into the distance. From where I stand, I take a gaze upon the open expanse of seas that lead to the wide fields of land of the Devand. I know there is more beyond that, including peoples. I see specks in the Devand, and specks far beyond it. Are these my subjects? Are these lands my kingdom, or are they simply too far beyond where I stand?\n\nI seek to explore these lands, so I must question myself: Do I dare graze their fields and conquer in the name of our king, or do we honor the pillars and constructs of diplomacy?"

  gotiriei_pilgrimage.11.d:0 "As I approach the peak of Rigoti, I feel myself losing pieces of my mind as vision and aberrations intrude. Every now and then I notice myself falling too deep into figment; I bite the skin off my fingers, strippingthe dullness of frost in favour of the painful relief of flowing blood. I have to constantly remind myself that I am alone, I am the sole Riei.\n\nYet it seems in all my attempts to keep myself sane, contradictions appear. A white boar appears in front of me, and I manage to feel its fur before it runs off. \n\nIt is real. \n\nThe white boars are a rare animal, said to be gifts from the Last True King, a sacred hunting animal. I believe it is time for another challenge, yet I do not know if my body is prepared to handle such a task.\n\nI take a look at the few options that I have: A few portions of rations that could be used as bait, or a small dagger. A trap, or a fight. As I continue on marching, the boar goads me into striking, or into planning. Is it worth sacrificing what little food I have left, or the remaining strength in my body? Yet, I remind myself once again, the Last True King seeks a worthy successor. I prepare myself for the task, and take the time to decide what to do…"

My body has little strength to carry on, yet I force it to move.\n\nSuddenly, a crash to my right: an avalanche.\n\nI attempt to run away, to find safety from imminent death, yet it seems that I have reached my limit. I collapse onto the floor, left to the mercy of the Last True King.\n\nIt seems like he has enough confidence in me to let me continue on, as I remain alive at current. As I awake, my body feels lighter, my mind replenished. I stand up, only to notice the avalanche has left no trail but for one small boulder, white as day, positioned perfectly in front of me. This form of stone is the same as the ones atop the peak of Rigoti, where the Construct of Kings lies. The Construct is a building made of the same white stone, containing one carved slab from each claimant Riei. It seems that the Last True King has tasked me with carving out the stone from my position and carrying it up the remainder of the mountain. I now face what feels like an impossible task. I have already  tired myself carrying only my own goods; the added weight of this stone could make it so I never see the peak!\n\nI have sat here for the past two hours thinking about how to approach this final duty of mine. In the end, I have decided that it would be best to…"

I cannot tell real from fake anymore, and that scares me. It doesn’t help that my body is giving up on me;lifting up my arm takes an unbearable amount of effort, and keeping my legs moving is a constant feeling of pain. I am tired, desperate, and alone.\n\nAlone with my thoughts…\n\nAlone with my visions\n\nAlone with the visages of past kings and heroes, who walk about with no stress whatsoever. I have recognized a few up to this point, some of whom I remember dearly from my youth, and others who seem like distant memories. Some trudge alongside me, while others ponder the world around them. I see them attempting to help me, as if trying to lift me up to reach the peak of Rigoti.\n\nIs this real? I see all of these heroes of my past, all these vague memories, and I feel like tearing up. I don’t know how they have the strength to continue on like this…\n\nYet as they remain in front of me… I want to know how they continue on. I want to use what little voice I have left, and ask them…"

I try to keep myself focused, but my mind tires from the climb, yearning to be relieved of this eternal journey. It is no longer my body that drives me forward either, for each step I take, I draw close to collapse.\n\nNo… this is the drive of the soul, of my righteousness, proof of my worthiness. As my body loses all of its functions, my mind shutting down, it is my soul that drives me forward. It is the soul that drove the many kings of old to make sacrifices. It is the soul that drove the godly kings to sacrifice themselves to save our world. It is my soul who will offer oblation as repayment.\n\nI saw the peak a while back, but now it looks so clear… so… so clear…\n\nThis vivid image of the mountaintop being braced by wind and snow imprints itself into my soul. As I take a step, it seems to get brighter.\n\nAnother step, even brighter.\n\nAnother step, as bright as if the sun had come down to illuminate the peak itself.\n\nAnother step, a gateway opens.\n\nAnother step, a hand reaches out for me, and I brace myself to be judged.\n\nI find myself at the bottom of Rigoti once more, tattered, shaken, yet alive. \n\nThe Last True King is our savior, and I am but his hammer, a pure soul to be molded in his likeness. He shall wield me as needed, and today he has chosen me to rule as his regent, his Riei."

As is tradition, he will be burned at the foot of the mountain, and his ashes will be spread around its base.\n\nFor many, this is a tragic day. Another righteous king has passed on, after all. For others though, they see this as a new opportunity. From the wake of the weakness of our kind shall rise a new righteous ruler to guide us. This is the cycle of the Riei, and we await for the day he appears to climb the mountain once more."
