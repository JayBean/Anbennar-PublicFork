 adventuring.4.b:0 "Confiscate some of their gold!"
 adventuring.4.c:0 "So what?"
 adventuring.5.t:0 "Disloyal Adventurers"
 adventuring.5.d:0 "A group of our most skilled adventurers refuse to share their spoils or knowledge of their endeavours."

 adventuring.8.d:0 "We may have wrested control of [rebuild_province.GetName] from their old owners, but a large contingent of our company have suggested we invest in building up the local infrastructure. Some, however, say this is a waste of time, and we should focus on simply using the province as a home base for nearby quests and adventure."
 adventuring.8.a:0 "Good idea, foundations are key!"
