 promote_adventurer_unity:0 "Promote Adventurer Unity"
 promote_adventurer_unity_desc:0 "Adventurers typically organize themselves into small, tightly-knit parties to handle quests far beyond the capabilities of any one man or woman. Similarly, parties are often associated with a guild, and guilds often answer to adventuring companies. In the wake of the Greentide, dozens of major adventuring companies answered the call to arms and defended Cannor from Korgus' horde, ultimately turning the tide at Rottenstep and moving onwards to drive the orcs out of Escann once and for all. However, adventurers are individualistic by nature, and without an existential threat, they are fickle and rare to cooperate with one another. In these dangerous times, unity is a luxury we cannot take for granted."
