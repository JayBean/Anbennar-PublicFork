 witch_king.7.t:0 "The Black Doctrine"
 witch_king.7.d:0 ""There are no gods, at least not how the clergy perceives them, for a god is merely a being with the power to perceive the world through the magical chaos that binds it. If there are gods, then a sufficiently powerful mage that can bend the chaos of magic to their will is too a god."\n- Adelar síl na Whistlehill\n\nThe writings of Adelar, one of the many floodborn mages born in Escann during the Crimson Deluge, had been banned in the wake of the many wars in Cannor. Yet his writings lived on in a thriving underground book trade, collected into a single book known as The Black Doctrine.\n\nHaving secured a translated copy of The Black Doctrine, [This.Monarch.GetName] understood why it was banned: Fear. The same fear that had caused their neighbours to dub [This.Monarch.GetHerHim] a Witch King. A fear of the truth - that [This.Monarch.GetSheHe] was so above all others on the Ascendant Path that [This.Monarch.GetSheHe] was effectively a god.\n\nNot in [This.GetName] though. Here, where [This.Monarch.GetName] rules completely, there can be only one truth."

 witch_king.7.b:0 "I shall not abandon my faith."
