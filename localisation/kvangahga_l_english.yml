 kvangahga_events.6.dd:0 "When Kvanga made the gnolls she did so in Her own image, from birth they are blessed by Her claw. Those who are not her children might still earn her favour however. The Trial of the Reforged Chain is a sacred rite in the Kvangahga faith that allows non-gnolls to gain Kvanga's blessing and be seen as equal in Her eyes.\n\nSupplicants to the trial must craft a weapon or tool that will be used in a series of tests, be that hunting great beasts, gladiatorial combat or games of skill and accuracy.\n\nThe Trials occur locally each year when the mystic artisans decree the portents are right, but in this instance our ruler has taken a direct hand and held a grand national trial to find the greatest candidates to bring into their court. They must now decide the theme of this grand trial."
