 kvangahga_events.2.t:0 "Repurposed Relics"
 kvangahga_events.2.d:0 "Kvanga’s glory is self evident to us but our kin amongst the Xhazobkult can take some convincing, perhaps if we show them the power of Kvanga by recycling their profane icons into our blessed relics it will help ease the transition."

 kvangahga_events.5.a:0 "Glory to Kvanga!"
 kvangahga_events.6.t:0 "Trial of the Reforged Chain"
 kvangahga_events.6.dd:0 "When Kvanga made the gnolls she did so in Her own image, from birth they are blessed by Her claw. Those who are not her children might still earn her favour however. The Trial of the Reforged Chain is a sacred rite in the Kvangahga faith that allows non-gnolls to gain Kvanga's blessing and be seen as equal in Her eyes.\n\nSupplicants to the trial must craft a weapon or tool that will be used in a series of tests, be that hunting great beasts, gladiatorial combat or games of skill and accuracy.\n\nThe Trials occur locally each year when the mystic artisans decree the portents are right, but in this instance our ruler has taken a direct hand and held a grand national trial to find the greatest candidates to bring into their court. They must now decide the theme of this grand trial."

 kvangahga_events.6.a:0 "The Scavenger's Trial"
 kvangahga_events.6.a.tt:0 "To scrap and repurpose is a most holy act in the eyes of Kvanga, this year our ruler has decreed that each supplicant must scavenge the wastes for their forging materials, emulating the mystic artisans of old"
 kvangahga_events.6.b:0 "The Beastmaster's Trial"
 kvangahga_events.6.b.tt:0 "Kvanga gave the gnolls the will and the might to assert their dominance over the beasts of the wild, those that seek her blessing must demonstrate that they too can control the wild beasts.

 kvangahga_events.6.c:0 "The Corsair's Trial"
 kvangahga_events.6.c.tt:0 "Predator and prey are a natural part of Kvanga's design. Those that seek her blessing must show that they are the former, not the latter. Our ruler has decreed that supplicants must forge a vicious boarding axe and pillage the shipping lanes of our foes"
 kvangahga_events.6.d:0 "The Monster Hunter's Trial"
 kvangahga_events.6.d.tt:0 "Throughout our lands there are many vile creatures that are notoriously hard to kill due to their otherworldly powers, these monsters have proven a thorn in our side for some time, it will be a worthy test to slay them in Kvanga's name. Our ruler has decreed that supplicants must compete in teams to craft arms capable of slaying these ferocious creature"
 kvangahga_events.6.e:0 "The Goldsmith's Trial"
 kvangahga_events.6.e.tt:0 "To create a thing of value from the scraps and cast offs of the world is at the heart of what Kvanga expects from her followers. Our ruler has decreed that supplicants must craft an item that is a true work of art using broken jewellery and poor quality precious metals"

 kvangahga_events.6.f.tt:0 "Firearms are the weapons of the future, the combination of roaring flames and hardened metal speaks to something in the gnollish soul, a spark of Kvanga's glory.

 kvangahga_events.6.h.tt:0 "What the humans call Artificery is the greatest expression of the Kvangahgan art, having supplicants create enchanted wonders would be an excellent test, but working with magic can be dangerous and unpredictable. Our ruler has decreed that the supplicants must forge a wondrous item enchanted with magic and demonstrate it before a panel of the greatest mystic artisans in our realm"

 kvangahga_events.7:0 "Corpses as Ammunition?"
 kvangahga_events.7.t:0 "Corpses as Ammunition?"
 kvangahga_events.7.d:0 "In the Age of Monsters, the Kvangahgari were known for their innovative warfare tactics, including the use of decaying bodies as projectiles or alchemical ingredients. The most reviled practice, at least among the enemies of the gnolls, was the use of rotting corpses as ammunition – foul remains being flung at their enemies during sieges to crush enemy morale.\n\nNow, as [MonarchName] considers reviving this ancient practice, dissent arises within the court. The war-priests advocate using the bodies of fallen foes, arguing that their decomposition can be harnessed to enhance our ranged soldiers and inflict terror on our opponents. Your more conventional generals, however, argue that rams and siege towers are provably more effective tools of war. Can such macabre tactics truly match the effectiveness of conventional steel weaponry?"
 kvangahga_events.7.a:0 "Use their bodies. Our foes will serve us one final time"
 kvangahga_events.7.b:0 "There is nothing better than steel"

 kvangahga_events.9.t:0 "One Man’s Trash…"
 kvangahga_events.9.d:0 "Your silly foolish neighbour keeps discarding old weaponry thinking the rust makes it unusable and worthless. But you know better. After all, one man’s trash…"
 kvangahga_events.9.a:0 "… is another man’s treasure. Our merchants will find buyers."
 kvangahga_events.9.b:0 "…is another man’s armory."

 kvangahga_events.10.a:0 "Commission a magical sword from the bones of a fallen veteran."

 kvangahga_events.11:0 "Bones as Instruments"
 kvangahga_events.11.t:0 "Bones as Instruments"
 kvangahga_events.11.d:0 "Monarch debates whether bones can be used as prized instruments in Sarhal. The faithful believe it would bring honour to your people to see bones made into instruments and sold in the bazaars, but the family of the deceased asks for their body to be returned."

 kvangahga_events.12.a:0 "Kvanga smiles upon us"
 kvangahga_events.12.b:0 "Share what we’ve learned across $COUNTRYNAME"

 kvangahga_events.13.t:0 "Chaotic Artefacts Appear in $chaos_good_province"
 kvangahga_events.13.d:0 "A cache of magical trinkets from the time of the genie sultanates have appeared, but are harming your gnolls when tinkered with. Do you take the hit to your reputation, after dealing with technology you can’t understand, or blame a rival for the ‘attack’ to save face?"
 kvangahga_events.13.a:0 "Ashen Skies! Go and help the injured."
 kvangahga_events.13.b:0 "Blame $chaos_good_rival for the chaos!"

 kvangahga_events.14:0 "A Center of Recycling"
 kvangahga_events.14.t:0 "Creating a Center of Recycling"
 kvangahga_events.14.d:0 "What was once considered just a mundane dump site for the kingdom's refuse has become an unexpected center of attraction in $recycling_province. A jeweller-priest has turned the site into a bustling hub where gnolls find reusable treasures to give to the expert to create wonderful material. Do you celebrate, sponsor the priest’s activities, or hire them for yourself?"
 kvangahga_events.14.a:0 "They are following Kvanga’s Teachings"
 kvangahga_events.14.b:0 "Think what they could do if we gave them our support."
 kvangahga_events.14.c:0 "We have a place for him here."
 kvangahga_events.15:0 "The Smith Priests Need Support"
 kvangahga_events.15.t:0 "The Holy Smiths Need Support"
 kvangahga_events.15.d:0 "Our holy smiths have come to $RULER with a petition. They have run out of scrap, soon will be forced to move away from the way of Kvanga and use fresh materials instead of reforging as the rites demand, to keep producing for $COUNTRY. Do you go to your neighbours to buy  them what your priests want, or not?"
 kvangahga_events.15.a:0 "Buy second-hand swords and steels."
 kvangahga_events.15.b:0 "Buy trinkets and jewels from our neighbours."
 kvangahga_events.15.c:0 "We are not paying them to use bad materials!"

 kvangahga_events.16.t:0 "Krah Subjects Object to Treatment of Their Dead"
 kvangahga_events.16.d:0 "Kvanagha Gnolls eat their dead to honour them and ensure no part goes to waste. The humans/elves/harimari/other races seem to object when we honour their dead as well. Do we bring them to heel, or respect their silly beliefs?"
 kvangahga_events.16.a:0 "Their views mean nothing. They are part of $COUNTRY."
 kvangahga_events.16.b:0 "Let the other foolish races manage their dead."
 kvangahga_events.16.c:0 "We are a state of many races and creeds."

 kvangahga_events.17.t:0 "You did WHAT with our dead?"
 kvangahga_events.17.d:0 "Kvanagha Gnolls eat their dead to honour them and ensure no parts go to waste. It gets a bit awkward when our squeamish allies send a diplomatic to complain about seeing us eating their great aunt, though. Why are they so offended?"
 kvangahga_events.17.a:0 "Fine, I suppose we WON’T eat their corpses. "
 kvangahga_events.17.b:0 "Fools – they just don’t understand our way of life."

 kvangahga_events.18:0 "This Gnoll Tastes Bad"
 kvangahga_events.18.t:0 "This $DominantRace Tastes Funny…"
 kvangahga_events.18.d:0 " After a funeral ceremony for a particularly well-known and notably corpulent $DominantRace merchant in $spoiled_merchant_area, several members of the community have fallen ill. Feasting on honoured dead $ is important – only by completing the ritual will Kvanga allow them  to be reborn anew – but all the mould and rot on the dead gnoll makes eating them … undesirable. Either send in the army to help eat the $DominantRace, let him rot and upset the locals, or lead from the front – eat the gnoll yourself."
 kvangahga_events.18.a:0 "He must be eaten. Send in the army to help."
 kvangahga_events.18.b:0 "This is a sign from Kvanga. Do not eat the merchant."
 kvangahga_events.18.c:0 "A [RulerTitle] leads from the front. Give me a fork."

 kvangahga_events.19.t:0 "A funeral ceremony goes wrong"
 kvangahga_events.19.d:0 "The funeral of a notorious gnoll brewmaster and bon vivant, known for his love of strong spirits, takes a strange turn. As per tradition, the community gathers to consume his remains, but it seems Kvanga blessed his body with a uniquely alcoholic taste."
 kvangahga_events.19.a:0 "A blessing from Kvanga!"
 kvangahga_events.19.b:0 "Let our allies taste our brewmaster’s final concoction!"
 kvangahga_events.19.c:0 "Send his body to my palace for consumption!"
 kvangahga_events.20:0 "A Pact with Demons?"
 kvangahga_events.20.t:0 "A Pact with Demons?"
 kvangahga_events.20.d:0 " Wherever there are gnolls, there are those who still follow the Xhazobkult kult despite the Kvangha teachings. Either convert the non-believers or let them stray.\n\nSince the First Xhazobine formed their demonic pact, there have always been those who diverged from Kvanga’s path and sought power despite the evil that would stain their souls. In $demon_pact_province, a Xhazobkult kult has been obstinate, refusing to give up their evil powers. Either convert the non-believers or continue to let them stray."
 kvangahga_events.20.a:0 "We shall reforge them."
 kvangahga_events.20.b:0 "They shall return to the fold in time."
 kvangahga_events.20.c:0 "We are a tolerant people. Make an example of them."

 kvangahga_events.21:0 "A Demon Pact Goes Wrong."
 kvangahga_events.21.t:0 "A Demon Pact Goes Wrong."
 kvangahga_events.21.d:0 "A large and brutal sacrifice takes place in a province in your country, outside of the state’s control. It goes wrong, bringing blight to the area. An event to encourage converting or removing the Xhazobkult from your land."
 kvangahga_events.21.a:0 "Those fools. They will learn in time."
 kvangahga_events.21.b:0 "Show them the error of their ways."
 kvangahga_events.22:0 "A Demon Pact Goes… Right?"

 kvangahga_events.22.d:0 "A large and brutal sacrifice takes place in $demon_pact_province, outside of the state’s control.\n\nSerfs flee to the capital, and after a beleaguered representative explains to you the situation, your leader decides to act:"
 kvangahga_events.22.a:0 "Just take the serfs in at the capital. We’ll deal with the Xhazobkult later"
 kvangahga_events.22.b:0 "Heretics are heretics. Send our priests to undo their demonic work."
 kvangahga_events.22.c:0 "Maybe there’s something to this Xhazbokult…"
