 kvangahga_events.6.t:0 "Trial of the Reforged Chain"
 kvangahga_events.6.dd:0 "When Kvanga made the gnolls she did so in Her own image, from birth they are blessed by Her claw. Those who are not her children might still earn her favour however. The Trial of the Reforged Chain is a sacred rite in the Kvangahga faith that allows non-gnolls to gain Kvanga's blessing and be seen as equal in Her eyes.\n\nSupplicants to the trial must craft a weapon or tool that will be used in a series of tests, be that hunting great beasts, gladiatorial combat or games of skill and accuracy.\n\nThe Trials occur locally each year when the mystic artisans decree the portents are right, but in this instance our ruler has taken a direct hand and held a grand national trial to find the greatest candidates to bring into their court. They must now decide the theme of this grand trial."

 kvangahga_events.6.a.tt:0 "To scrap and repurpose is a most holy act in the eyes of Kvanga, this year our ruler has decreed that each supplicant must scavenge the wastes for their forging materials, emulating the mystic artisans of old"
 kvangahga_events.6.b:0 "The Beastmaster's Trial"
 kvangahga_events.6.b.tt:0 "Kvanga gave the gnolls the will and the might to assert their dominance over the beasts of the wild, those that seek her blessing must demonstrate that they too can control the wild beasts.

 kvangahga_events.6.c:0 "The Corsair's Trial"
 kvangahga_events.6.c.tt:0 "Predator and prey are a natural part of Kvanga's design. Those that seek her blessing must show that they are the former, not the latter. Our ruler has decreed that supplicants must forge a vicious boarding axe and pillage the shipping lanes of our foes"
 kvangahga_events.6.d:0 "The Monster Hunter's Trial"
 kvangahga_events.6.d.tt:0 "Throughout our lands there are many vile creatures that are notoriously hard to kill due to their otherworldly powers, these monsters have proven a thorn in our side for some time, it will be a worthy test to slay them in Kvanga's name. Our ruler has decreed that supplicants must compete in teams to craft arms capable of slaying these ferocious creature"
 kvangahga_events.6.e:0 "The Goldsmith's Trial"
 kvangahga_events.6.e.tt:0 "To create a thing of value from the scraps and cast offs of the world is at the heart of what Kvanga expects from her followers. Our ruler has decreed that supplicants must craft an item that is a true work of art using broken jewellery and poor quality precious metals"

 kvangahga_events.6.f.tt:0 "Firearms are the weapons of the future, the combination of roaring flames and hardened metal speaks to something in the gnollish soul, a spark of Kvanga's glory.

 kvangahga_events.7.t:0 "Corpses as Ammunition?"
 kvangahga_events.7.d:0 "In the Age of Monsters, the Kvangahgari were known for their innovative warfare tactics, including the use of decaying bodies as projectiles or alchemical ingredients. The most reviled practice, at least among the enemies of the gnolls, was the use of rotting corpses as ammunition – foul remains being flung at their enemies during sieges to crush enemy morale.\n\nNow, as [MonarchName] considers reviving this ancient practice, dissent arises within the court. The war-priests advocate using the bodies of fallen foes, arguing that their decomposition can be harnessed to enhance our ranged soldiers and inflict terror on our opponents. Your more conventional generals, however, argue that rams and siege towers are provably more effective tools of war. Can such macabre tactics truly match the effectiveness of conventional steel weaponry?"
 kvangahga_events.7.a:0 "Use their bodies. Our foes will serve us one final time"
 kvangahga_events.7.b:0 "There is nothing better than steel"
 kvangahga_events.7.c:0 "Our artificers can make more use of their bodies…"

 kvangahga_events.8.t:0 "Corpses as a fortress"
 kvangahga_events.8.d:0 "With purposeful strides, [Root.Monarch.GetName] entered the council chamber, commanding the attention of the advisors gathered inside. The clash of ideas that had reverberated like cannon fire in the air stilled for a moment before the cacophony resumed.\n\n"It shall be glorious," asserted the [ROOT.Capital.GetName]’s high priest, his words infused with certainty. "In life our Gnolls fought for [Root.GetName], and in death they shall serve it as well."\n\nAmidst the priest’s raving, the chief architect objects, his tone stern. "A bad idea," he cautioned, his short words resonating with practicality. “Bodies break down over time. Bones and faith are no substitute for stone and metal.”\n\nThe priest began to speak again, until [Root.Monarch.GetName] raised a hand. "Enough!" they declared, their voice exasperated, cutting through the dissent. "My decision is made.""
 kvangahga_events.8.a:0 "The Smith-Priest is right. Our fallen can protect us still."
 kvangahga_events.8.b:0 "The engineer is right. Bring him to my court."
 kvangahga_events.9:0 "One Man’s Trash…"
 kvangahga_events.9.t:0 "One Man’s Trash…"
 kvangahga_events.9.d:0 "As our mystic-artisans travel the lands of our neighbours to barter or scavenge they often find ancient battle sites where weapons and armour have been discarded and left to rust and moulder away, seen as useless junk by their former owners. We know better, with a little time and effort these weapons can be made functional again and put to good use. After all, one man’s trash…"

 kvangahga_events.10.d:0 "The clang of hammers and the scrape of chisel and file echo through the workshop as [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches the wizened gnoll hunched over a mighty anvil inscribed with the sacred runes of the Kvangahga faith.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] had been reliably informed the old mystic was the greatest weaponsmith of the age and had made the trek to this remote workshop to commission a mighty weapon blessed by the goddess herself. Now that [he/she] stood in this sacred place, [he/she] knew that something truly remarkable would be crafted this day.\n\nWordlessly the ancient gnoll gestures to two bundles laid before the anvil, almost as though he had known [Root.Monarch.GetName] would come. On the left, a pile of bleached bones each carved with intricate markings. On the right a collection of broken and battered metal objects of a long-forgotten design, still as shiny as the day they were first forged.\n\n“Choose” croaked the artisan, in a voice like the grinding of a tomb door."
 kvangahga_events.10.a:0 "I choose the bones of the honoured warriors."
 kvangahga_events.10.b:0 "I choose the steel of the ancient smiths."
 kvangahga_events.10.c:0 "Actually I can’t afford this…"

 kvangahga_events.11.t:0 "Bones as Instruments"
 kvangahga_events.11.d:0 "Though bards are rare within many gnollish societies, this is not the case for the Kvangahga who see their storytelling traditions and musical inventions as work that Kvanga herself smiles upon. A travelling troupe of bards has requested to trade for the bones of our recently fallen warriors to craft into instruments they will use in a new performance commemorating the great gnollish warriors of the past. \n\nThis would surely be an honour for the dead but may cause some upset among their kin who may wish to use the bones themselves. How should we handle this situation? "
 kvangahga_events.11.a:0 "Give the bones to the bards. Honour our dead."
 kvangahga_events.11.b:0 "Leave the bones with their kin. Respect the living."

 kvangahga_events.12.t:0 "A Cache of Ancient Treasures"
 kvangahga_events.12.d:0 "While scavenging an ancient tomb, one of our mystic artisans has uncovered a hoard of enchanted artefacts from the time of the Genie Sultanates that they have gifted to our [monarchtitle]. It will be a great honour for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to reforge these arcane items themselves, but perhaps by involving others in the process we could learn much about the techniques used by the ancients. Or we could always sell them to the highest bidder, though this will likely be frowned upon."
 kvangahga_events.12.a:0 "Kvanga smiles upon [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 kvangahga_events.12.b:0 "The secrets of these artefacts should be shared across [Root.GetName]"

 kvangahga_events.13.d:0 "While scavenging an ancient tomb, one of our mystic artisans has uncovered a hoard of enchanted artefacts from the time of the Genie Sultanates. However when they returned to their workshop to begin tinkering with the items a storm of chaotic planar magics was unleashed on the town, causing devastation and calling the skill of [countryadjective] craftsgnolls into question!

 kvangahga_events.14.t:0 "Creating a Center of Recycling"
 kvangahga_events.14.d:0 "What was once a mundane waystation along one of our trade routes has recently made a name for itself as a centre for the collection and distribution of scrap items, drawing mystic artisans from far and wide to collect junk to be reforged and recycled into useful and wondrous items.\n\nThe gnoll responsible for this centre of recycling is young priest specialised in creating works of art from scrap material who set up the centre to collect refuse materials from travellers. We could commend this gnoll, offer to financially support them or even offer them a place at our court, such an innovative mind would serve us well."
 kvangahga_events.14.a:0 "They are following Kvanga’s Teachings"
 kvangahga_events.14.b:0 "Think what they could do if we gave them our support."

 kvangahga_events.15.t:0 "The Mystic Artisans Need Support"
 kvangahga_events.15.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened, we have run out of scrap materials! Our priests have come to us with a plea for support, they claim that they have run out of recyclable materials and soon will be forced to produce goods from fresh materials. While the Kvangahgan rites do not forbid this, it is not the preferred way for our mystic artisans to conduct their business and is not seen as a sacred process in the same way as using recyclable materials is.\n\nThey ask that we import scrap materials from our neighbours at cost, while this would appease the priests for the time being it is not strictly necessary from a theological perspective, how should we proceed?"
 kvangahga_events.15.a:0 "Buy broken swords and armour from our neighbours."
 kvangahga_events.15.b:0 "Buy broken trinkets and jewellery from our neighbours."

 kvangahga_events.16.d:0 "While other races are squeamish about consuming the meat of humanoids, particularly their own kin, to we Kvangahga gnolls it is one of the most sacred of rites and a great honour to pass on the wisdom and strength of your flesh to your community.\n\nSadly some of our non-gnollish subjects do not see it the same way. Recently when a particularly prominent member of the local community who had passed the Trial of the Reforged Chain passed away he was given the full honour of a Kvangahgan funeral, but this has caused outrage amongst his kin who demand to be allowed to hold their own funerary rites."
 kvangahga_events.16.a:0 "Their views mean nothing. They are part of [Root.GetName]."

 kvangahga_events.17.d:0 "While other races are squeamish about consuming the meat of humanoids, particularly their own kin, to we Kvangahga gnolls it is one of the most sacred of rites and a great honour to pass on the wisdom and strength of your flesh to your community.\n\nSadly our allies do not see it the same way, (ally nation) has sent an envoy to complain after witnesses saw our troops consuming the bodies of fallen allies after a recent campaign, we have assured them this was meant as a sign of respect but they continue to be outraged by this turn of events."
 kvangahga_events.17.a:0 "Fine, I suppose we WON’T eat their corpses. "
 kvangahga_events.17.b:0 "Fools – they just don’t understand our way of life."

 kvangahga_events.18.d:0 "After a funeral ceremony for a particularly well-known and notably corpulent merchant in [spoiled_merchant_area.GetName], several members of the community have fallen ill. Feasting on the honoured dead is important to ensure the strength and wisdom of their flesh is passed on to the community – but the severity of the mould and rot on the dead gnoll makes eating them … undesirable. Either send in the army to help eat the gnoll, let him rot and upset the locals, or lead from the front – eat the gnoll yourself."
 kvangahga_events.18.a:0 "He must be eaten. Send in the army to help."
 kvangahga_events.18.b:0 "This is a sign from Kvanga. Do not eat the merchant."

 kvangahga_events.19.d:0 "We have received news that the funeral of a famous gnollish brewmaster known for her love of strong spirits has taken a strange turn. As is tradition the local community has gathered to consume her flesh and send her soul on to Kvanga’s forge, but it would appear that the brewmasters activities in life have given her flesh the properties of a potent alcohol and the townsfolk have become quite drunk, with the funeral celebrations now lasting for several booze-fuelled days!"
