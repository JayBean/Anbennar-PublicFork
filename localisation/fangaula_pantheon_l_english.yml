 HOLY_SITE_390_DESC:0 "Sirik is the most sacred holy site of Aro, a legendary hero and king of the Fangaulan Pantheon. After Aro tired of ruling Fangaula, he left his empire in the hands of his sons before helping the Storm-Queens overthrow Akasik’s genie rulers. Following his final triumph, Aro climbed the mountain of Sirik, ascended into the air on his magic stool, and encountered the spirit of God on the moon. Impressed by his many achievements, God asked Aro to become his successor, to rule the spirits and ancestors that govern creation as the divine king, a task Aro continues to this day."
 HOLY_SITE_5734_DESC:0 "Dulugu’s birthplace, Bogorr is a revered holy site for the Ndurubu people. Known as "the hungering lion," Dulugu was the human reincarnation of the totem animal Fojora. The site's sacredness stems from an immense eternal blaze that erupted on Dulugu's death, symbolizing his rebirth as Fojara’s newest iteration. Where human and animal realms intersect, Bogorr draws pilgrims both human and animal to kneel before the eternal flame in reverence, acknowledging Fojara as the protector of Fangaula's animals and patron of hunters."
 HOLY_SITE_6098_DESC:0 "Deep within the Western Salahadesi Desert shines the Oasis of the Water Dream, a fresh water pool shielded by rock outcroppings. Hewn into the stone cliffs above the oasis stands the temple of Rostgrax, a collection of subterranean chambers and tunnels older than humanity. A centerpiece of Mukarron culture, the temple houses shrines devoted to deific figures grand and small: ancient primordials, forgotten deities, spirit animals, and, above all others, Biakata, the planetouched founder of the Second Fangaulan Empire. Due to its pluralistic significance, local powers treat the temple as a sanctuary and grant it a great deal of autonomy."
 HOLY_SITE_477_DESC:0 "Long before the three great mothers Dojawo Iru Iyyagba, Yaboko Alabaale Iyyodo, and Oyuno Aboyuu Iyyayuu lived along the Mother’s Sorrow, the Mantimatu worshipped a primordial cattle spirit that supped on the river’s life-giving waters in Bixanrit. These ancient forbears erected a bronze temple, its entrance adorned by a flawless ruby visible up and down the Sorrow’s length, to house the spirit. For much of its recent history, the bronze temple of Bixanrit has slowly sunk into the sands, neglected by Khet overlords after Krah and their gnoll hordes drove the cattle mothers from their homeland. By refounding the temple, all in Sarhal shall remember Yaboko Alabaale Iyyodo’s sacrificial merging with the cow spirit to become the mother of all calves and, of course, the Khet’s glaring insignificance."
 HOLY_SITE_5787_DESC:0 "The goddess Makan, after claiming the drum heart of freedom as her new instrument, flowed through the savannah as a great river, her music stirring shackled hearts to pine for liberation. In accordance with this tradition, Makan’s faithful liberate and transport enslaved peoples to the Makan’s riverbank in Zitarr to partake in an event called Tabo Adau, or "shirking of chains." Under the juvenile goddesses’ gaze, the slaves purify themselves in the river’s waters before moving downstream to a series of rapids formed from thousands of abandoned shackles. With a cry mirroring Makan’s own sorrow at the loss of her drum, they toss their symbols of enslavement into the waters, vowing to live free forevermore. Naturally, Zitarr also serves as a confluence for resistance movements across Western Sarhal."
 HOLY_SITE_5710_DESC:0 "Once a quiet square managed by the halfling city-founder-turned-god Kunolo, the bazaar of Kekwiw, or "Small View", stretches along the shallow ridge overlooking Kunolo Bay. Due to Kunolo’s geographical importance, Kekwiw attracts one of the most diverse crowds in all of Sarhal, particularly after the Age of Unraveling. Minor shrines devoted to Fangaulan figures mark the space into quadrants, and merchants compete vigorously via donations to secure space close to these sanctums for divine favour. The shrines also exude an arcane aura that curbs aggression and begets honesty, with the bazaar hosting important diplomatic summits from around the known world. On pilgrim-days Kekwiw hosts a grand rite for the vakwene, Jiromji's eclectic gender minority. As the city celebrates at sunset during a full moon, Kunolo-priests funnel a ritual into the deity's shrines at the market’s center. By dawn's break worshippers’ flesh is made anew in their soul's true form."

 fangaulan_pantheon.1.t:0 "A Worthy Patron"
 fangaulan_pantheon.1.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] looked out across [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] new realm, thinking about how far [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has come, and who [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] owed that achievement to. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] friends and family were a great help, of course, but there was one above them all who had protected [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] since [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] adolescence.  [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked over and knelt down in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal shrine, holding [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand crafted Gris Gris charm first close against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest, then up to the shrine itself. The charm glowed warmly in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] whispered a prayer of thanks to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] divine patron…"
 fangaulan_pantheon.1.a:0 "I thank thee"
 fangaulan_pantheon.2.t:0 "Returning to God"
 fangaulan_pantheon.2.d:0 "It is a sad, sad day. Our previous leader has left their life with us behind, and has moved on to the moon, to be with God in the afterlife. Though it is undoubtedly a tragic occasion, we do have the opportunity to honor their legacy by dedicating an extravagant funeral in their name in Gamyi, according to the rites of the Kanhati priesthood.\n\nLed by a seasoned Kanhati priest, a grand procession, attended by tens of thousands, would be set up at the base of the ancient spire situated there. Dressed in a black robe and donning a red-ruby horned mask in honor of the god of death, the Kanhati priest would oversee the building of a massive funeral pyre – after it is completed, the Kanhati priest will go through all of the proper funeral rites, leading the audience in mourning. Then the funeral casket is cast into the fire, and as the body is consumed by the flames, those gathered remember and reflect on our late ruler’s life, as the memories accompany their spirit to the moon.\n\nIt would be very expensive, especially due to the large amount of wood required, but it would give us time to reflect and mourn, and it would certainly cast us in a positive light.  Sometimes, however, money can be worth more than respect."
 fangaulan_pantheon.2.a:0 "Send them off to Kanhati"
 fangaulan_pantheon.2.b:0 "A local funeral will do"
 fangaulan_pantheon.3.t:0 "A Cry for Heir"
 fangaulan_pantheon.3.d:0 "With our ruler advancing in years, and the succession frighteningly insecure, our court’s priestess of Ujun has proposed holding a ritual sacrifice to the Ujun sisters for a fertility blessing. The ritual reenacts the story of the Beautiful Mother’s sacrifice for the tribe's children.\n\nDuring the rites, actors would play out the story of how the Beautiful Mother allowed herself to be eaten by a monstrous Kadda while wearing a dress made out of poisonous plants, sacrificing herself but killing the beast in the process. Of course, we cannot sacrifice our actor, so in the place of the Beautiful Mother we will need to perform a massive cattle sacrifice, which would devastate our cow herds for years.  Nonetheless, completing the ritual should ensure an heir and secure the line of succession, even if it is at the cost of productivity."

 fangaulan_pantheon.4.t:0 "Divine Wrath"
 fangaulan_pantheon.4.d:0 "The river that flows from Makan down to Zittar has suddenly flooded, causing destruction and displacing many. The peasants living by the river are proclaiming this is a sign of the goddess Makan’s anger, and have proposed we perform a ritual to calm her. This ritual, the Tabo Adau, includes transporting slaves to the riverbank and liberating them from bondage, as they purify themselves in the water and toss their dirty shackles into the rapids.\n\nIf we were to fulfill their request then this may set a dangerous precedent that could encourage others to seek escape from slavery, showing our nobles that we are willing to give up their slaves – their property – to alleviate the unrest of the masses. It would surely show them that our authority is not as great as it seems, allowing people to question our legitimacy.  However, if we did deny their request it could lead to outright revolts and continued tensions for years to come, as the people will see our refusal as a betrayal. "
 fangaulan_pantheon.4.a:0 "Allow the ritual to pass"
 fangaulan_pantheon.4.b:0 "This is only a ploy to breed rebellion, deny them!"
 fangaulan_pantheon.5.t:0 "Pillar of Eternity"
 fangaulan_pantheon.5.d:0 "Recently, a terrible storm was forming above Sigilan, one that threatened the livelihoods of many. Our priests were preparing to sacrifice a large part of the grain stores, hoping to appease any aspects of God that would listen, when a massive bolt of lightning hit the Pillar of Aro! \n\nHowever, instead of damaging the pillar, the lightning washed over the pillar in a shower of sparks, dissipating as it reached the ground. For perhaps ten minutes afterwards, the pillar glowed a brilliant blue, as it lit up the stormy sky.  The storm that promised to cause devastation receded, calming down like it was being sung to sleep by the pillar, like a mother would sing to her baby.\n\nThis is clearly a gift from the gods – all that is left for us is to decide how to interpret this sign of favor."
 fangaulan_pantheon.5.a:0 "A sign for peace and prosperity"
 fangaulan_pantheon.5.b:0 "A testament of Aro’s craft!"
