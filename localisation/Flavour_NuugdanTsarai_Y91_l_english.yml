 Y91_tuiista_jaal_horde_title:0 "Tuiista Jaal Horde"
 Y91_tuiista_jaal_horde_desc:0 "Ever since the great Kusheng Nurgai Bagaatun united the three major clans, diplomats have been trying to increase the cohesion of the clans. This has however proven difficult as the Shuvüüsh greatly value both freedom and tradition. Perhaps the upcoming Hekuudzoungh Festival planned for 1450 can bring forth some change."

 Y91_jindeshi_valley_title:0 "Jincheng Valley"
 Y91_jindeshi_valley_desc:0 "It is now time for us to secure a new land for our subjects, to let their livestock graze and their warriors raze. Let us conquer these lands and fulfil our promise."

 Y91_razer_of_upper_yanshen_title:0 "Razer of Upper Yanshen"
 Y91_razer_of_upper_yanshen_desc:0 "We should aid the Tuiista Jaal in conquering the surrounding urban centers, as this would bring great wealth to both of our clans and bring us one step closer to both dominating Yanshen and strengthening our bond with our subject."

 Y91_integrating_the_tuiista_jaal_title:0 "Integrating the Tuiista Jaal"
 Y91_integrating_the_tuiista_jaal_desc:0 "If we are to rule these lands with a firm grip, we must integrate our subjects into a single administration; no exceptions can be made, not even for our ancestral brethren.\n\nIt is time to convince the tribal elites to accept our demands for reform and buy them out."

 Y91_freeing_ogre_subjects_title:0 "The Aikogeoke Dispute"
 Y91_freeing_ogre_subjects_desc:0 "For a long time, Tuiista Jaal herders and farmers have tried to settle the harsh land of Aikogeoke, but they were always repelled by the Oni. \n\nNow that the Tuiista Jaal are migrating southward, it is now up to us to try and gain land from the demons. Let us show our little brother how its done!"

 Y91_start_oni_genocide_title:0 "First Oni Purge"
 Y91_start_oni_genocide_desc:0 "The time has come to purge these horned monsters; to this end we should lay siege to their capital and destroy their seat of power.\n\n§ROur advisors are drafting plans to use the Kamtarhid and Shamadhan minorities on the historical border with the Command to set up vassal states, when the purge is completed. As such, they advise against attempting to make those border provinces a core part of our administration.§!"

 Y91_clearing_the_demons_title:0 "Last Oni Purge"
 Y91_clearing_the_demons_desc:0 "We must make sure that historians will not refer to the upcoming years as the second Oni purge, but rather as the last Oni purge - no Oni can remain in the hills when we are done.\n\n§ROur advisors are drafting plans to use the Kamtarhid and Shamadhan minorities on the Ogre side of the historical border with the Command to set up vassal states; as such they advise against attempting to make those border provinces a core part of our administration.§!"

 Y91_prepare_seconds_title:0 "Prepare Seconds"
 Y91_prepare_seconds_desc:0 "Yemàjinun and the fortress of Xuanbik have been described by clan leaders as vital acquisitions to the realm. No longer do the hilly lands and the forts bar our Terrorbird riders from conquering the Jiangyang - instead, they now fulfil a vital logistical role to aid it.\n\nSuch a delicious meal simply means we must go for seconds."

 Y91_fields_for_the_fearless_title:0 "Fields for the Fearless"
 Y91_fields_for_the_fearless_desc:0 "The Shuvüüsh people bordering the lands of Jiantsiang have tried to let sneak their livestock into their fertile fields on more than one occassion. We should take these fields for our people, so that they may prosper."

 Y91_along_the_coast_title:0 "Along The Coast"
 Y91_along_the_coast_desc:0 "The path to the legendary city of Tianlou is one we must walk as a people. Only then will we truly flourish. To that end we should conquer along the lands of the coastal republics, where resistance is minimal and the lands are flat."

 Y91_at_the_tianlou_gate_desc:0 "If we are to take the city of Tianlou, we must ensure that we can partially surround it and attack it from multiple gates at once and take this jewel for ourselves."

 Y91_lucky_scales_title:0 "A Blue Chance"
 Y91_lucky_scales_desc:0 "The grand city of Jiangdu and its government once aided the Zhiqian in holding back our hordes, so with the fall of Xuanbik it was believed they would become our nemesis... \n\nNothing is less true; A rebellion of peasants has tore apart their realm and their military has suffered losses to a point where they cannot hope to reclaim stability without aid.\n\nTo them this is a disaster, to us, it is an opportunity. The self-declared peasant republic of Lanjinhui feigns strength and stability, but its institutions are weak, and its allies few. The only protection they have are their pitchforks and their unrulyness. If we are to either strike a deal with the old government in Jiangdu or make plans ourself, we can easily conquer this fertile farmland."

 Y91_jiangdu_reborn_title:0 "Jiangdu Reborn"
 Y91_jiangdu_reborn_desc:0 "One way or the other, we have done what had to be done to gain control over the region that once belonged to Jiangdu. Now is the time to set up a local government and look further inward."

 Y91_yanchung_logistics_title:0 "Yanzhong Logistics"
 Y91_yanchung_logistics_desc:0 "The city of Yanzhong is a vital location for our people to control if we wish to push further into yanshen, it is both a financial asset and a logistical hub on the Yanhe, let us take it and its surroundings."

 Y91_nostalgic_fields_title:0 "Nostalgic Fields"
 Y91_nostalgic_fields_desc:0 "In our attempt to cut through the Yansheni and reach Feiten from two sides we have come across a strangely familiar sight. Endless fields of sands and shrubbery, but these fields are uncannily salty.\n\nIndeed, a lake devoid of all water lies before us. Our troops are wel-trained to fight in lands this flat, so the western approach to Feiten will soon be open!"

 Y91_the_flanking_title:0 "The Flanking"
 Y91_the_flanking_desc:0 "With the conquest of the drained lake of Hongnguan and the subjugation of Tianlou behind us, we can threaten Feiten from two sides and cut the Yansheni world in half."

 Y91_daxugo_ambitions_title:0 "Daxugo Ambitions"
 Y91_daxugo_ambitions_desc:0 "If we wish to make these lands our own, we must make sure to control every single cultural center in Yanshen; only then can we absorb these people into our own."

 Y91_plan_daengun_invasion_desc:0 "The Odheongun people have long been subjects to the followers of Oedek; alas they have fallen to rebellions. It is time to reconquer these lands for our people and exploit its riches.\n\nLet us infiltrate their garrisons and collect information on their military. Once this is done we can crush them, together with the followers of Oedek - only this time they will never successfully rebel!"

 Y91_peace_treaty_title:0 "Peace Treaty"
 Y91_peace_treaty_desc:0 "The state of Daengun has been beaten back and is willing to engage in a treaty of conditional surrender; it is time to take the hilly lands of the menjeotaen for ourselves and give the fields of Segang to our brothers, as agreed."

 Y91_guwaamud_ambitions_desc:0 "The state of Guwaamud once stood for over 900 years. When it fell the Shuvüüsh swore vengeance: now is the day for a new era."

 Y91_at_the_jiangdu_gate_title:0 "At the Jiangdu Gate"
 Y91_at_the_jiangdu_gate_desc:0 "If we were to control either the fields of Ciying or those of Dacha, no river would stand between us and Jiangdu. With only a gate and a few thousand weak Yansheni stopping us, we will take the spoils of the city with ease."

 Y91_integrating_jiangdu_title:0 "Integrating Jiangdu"
 Y91_integrating_jiangdu_desc:0 "The city of Jiangdu has eluded us for a few years, but now it is firmly within our grasp. As we conquer cultural hub after cultural hub, it is becoming evident that we are indeed the third conquerors of these lands. Only we don't plan to crumble."

 Y91_plight_of_the_upper_raheni_title:0 "Plight Of The Upper Raheni"
 Y91_plight_of_the_upper_raheni_desc:0 "With the buffer states of Sir and Ghatasak established, we have ample claim to drive out the hobgoblins, orcs, and humans who might seek to control the Shamakhad fields.\n\nLet us liberate the land of our subject states back into their hands and weaken the powers that be."

 Y91_liberation_for_all_title:0 "Liberation For All"
 Y91_liberation_for_all_desc:0 "With the city of Sir secured and the state of Ghatasak fully restored we can now strive to push out the remaining hobgoblins, back deep into their wretched caves.\n\nLet us push them back into the Jade Mines until the only shade of red the hobgoblins cast over Haless is their blood."

 Y91_torches_for_all_title:0 "Torches For All"
 Y91_torches_for_all_desc:0 "Our artificers wish for us to establish a foothold in the Jade Mines, so that they may exploit the valuable resources inside. It is imperative, however, that we ensure the Shamakhad fields are secure from any violent and monstrous states. We should crush any orc clan which is not shepherded by man."

 Y91_jade_for_all_title:0 "Jade For All"
 Y91_jade_for_all_desc:0 "The artificers were satisfied with our acquisition of caves rich in natural resources, for a while. But now they come and petition before court, again. Not a week goes by that a man of science does not bother [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] about needing more steel for the manufactories or more bronze for something else. It is time we ensured the supply."

 Y91_artificery_stimulus_title:0 "Artificery Stimulus"
 Y91_artificery_stimulus_desc:0 "The artificers need more coal: that is the conclusion of the report which rests upon the desk of [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]. If we wish to economically compete and bolster our state with thriving science, we shall have to invest heavily into coal production and seize the necessary lands, all the while granting the artificers the rights they need to set up manufactories across the empire."

 Y91_damestear_demands_title:0 "Damestear Demands"
 Y91_damestear_demands_desc:0 "The artificers have discovered that the Oni didn't settle in Shinukhorchi at random, it has now been confirmed that the Kuresgiju spring is indeed a meteor crater consisting high volumes of damestear. The artificers are now imploring the state to invest heavily in the exploitation of this lake and previously known source in Jianxusi."

 Y91_precursor_relic_demands_title:0 "Precursor Relic Demands"
 Y91_precursor_relic_demands_desc:0 "With the demand for both coal and damestear met, and our country having a decent supply of precursor relics due to our control over Tianlou, one would think the artificers would be satisfied.\n\nYet it appears that this is not the case, for they desire an increase in the supply of precursor artifacts by ensuring that the deposits in Tianlou and on the island of Somyonghon are utilised to their logistical limit. The population of Tianlou will not be happy with us clearing whole neighborhoods to construct harvesting sites, and the islanders of Somyonghon have demanded we invest in their temples before we may expand industrial operations."

 Y91_daxugo_reforms_title:0 "Daxugo Reforms"
 Y91_daxugo_reforms_desc:0 "If we wish to come out of this period of unrest with our empire intact, we shall need to negotiate with local leaders of all factions, and make concessions of autonomy whilst demanding loyalty and levies. At the same time a large sum of money will have to be gathered to grease palms and pay reparations for our conquests.\n\nThis all shall be a temporary measure to calm down the situation, of course!"

 Y91_northern_yan_unification_title:0 "Jiangyang Pacification"
 Y91_northern_yan_unification_desc:0 "When we sent emissaries to rebellious Jiangyang provinces to demand they cease their rebellion, they never returned. When we subsequently sent emissaries to rebellious Jiangyang provinces to ask what it would take for them to cease their rebellion, some returned with demands, while others never returned.\n\nIt seems a part of the rebellious towns demand we invest into the regions through development projects. We should appease those we can, and slaughter those who resist. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

 Y91_hill_yan_unification_title:0 "Beikling Pacification"
 Y91_hill_yan_unification_desc:0 "Some of the Beikling have started an open revolt against the state, their hilly lands making them difficult to fight. Some prominent figures have refused negotiation, but others have responded well to the reparations paid during the Daxugo Reform. The Beikling people are a divided one, a portion of the populace being fiercely loyal to us as we have aided many in their liberation from the Horned Ogres. Others yet still cling to the days of Azjakuma or the teachings of the Lefthand Path. Others still remember the razing of Jinqiu and Jincheng. Thus their demands are as fractured as their people, the only common thread we could discover was that they all desired gainful employment. As such we have agreed to aid some locals in establishing workshops. We should appease those we can, and slaughter those who resist. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

 Y91_river_yan_unification_title:0 "Jiangszun Pacification"
 Y91_river_yan_unification_desc:0 "As our emissaries make their way up and down the Yanhe, bringing word back from local nobility in some of the richest cities in Haless, the situation is clear: the locals have seen a sharp decline in trade since our conquest and they demand independence or large investments into the region.\n\nTheir demands include repairing the Golden Highway, expanding markets, and clearing the river from rebel blockades. Some prominent figures have refused negotiation, and those will have to be dealt with. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

 Y91_coastal_yan_unification_title:0 "Gangim Pacification"
 Y91_coastal_yan_unification_desc:0 "Our efforts to negotiate with the Gangim nobility has not been in vain, for we now have a large list of demands - some petty, some reasonable - and all of them expensive.\n\nA significant portion of the Gangim nobility will lay down arms and attempt to pacify their populace if we ensure their coasts are once again secure from pirates, the same agreement they made with the previous two empires that conquered them. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

 Y91_forest_yan_unification_title:0 "Naamjyut Pacification"
 Y91_forest_yan_unification_desc:0 "The Naamjyut people care about a select few things: the right to their faith and being able to export their tea. As they view us as threatening both of these rights, many of the traditionalist nobles are thus unwilling to negotiate.\n\nThe ones that are willing demand a few things: they want to diversify their production economy with Lupulan rainforest lumber and want the state to aid in the acquiring of the saplings, which the Yanglam try to maintain a monopoly on. Perhaps we can placate the old guard by improving their tea yields. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

 Y91_western_yan_unification_title:0 "Szitu Incorporation?"
 Y91_western_yan_unification_desc:0 "If we are to unify all of the Yan people, we must destroy the Wulin and their Xiaken and incorporate the Szitu into our realm - let us stake our claim."

 Y91_yan_unification_title:0 "Yan Unification"
 Y91_yan_unification_desc:0 "Uniting all the Yan in Yanshen under one banner has been the goal of our empire ever since its foundation. None may harm our people, none may disturb our empire. We are Daxugo, father of all Yan."

 Y91_pings_people_title:0 "Pings People"
 Y91_pings_people_desc:0 "When Ping Shuang, founder of Pingoi and wife to the famous late king Jyuk left Zhuhungwok with her fleet, she single handedly created the largest Yan diaspora. It is now up to us to unite these people within our growing empire.\n\nNot only do we have ample claim to the lands of Pinghoi as the true heir to Zhuhungwok, we also have the duty to protect all Yan people. Not to mention the strategically vital positions they hold, from which we could exert pressure upon the Rahen gulf."

 Y91_distant_cousins_title:0 "Distant Sisters"
 Y91_distant_cousins_desc:0 "With the former lands of Pinghoi now in our grasp, our distant sisters are once more united and we grow ever closer to an empire that represents all Yan. Now is the time to use the strategic positions previously held by the Pinghoi pirates to drain the Rahen gulf of its wealth and exert influence on Rahen and Sarhal alike!"

 Y91_formalize_gommo_membership_title:0 "Gommo Membership"
 Y91_formalize_gommo_membership_desc:0 "Let us join together with the international community of scientific states, so that we may enjoy even more cooperation between our great nations.\n\n§RExpect a portion of our most industrious provinces and their surrounding lands to gain gnomish communities of various sizes.§!\n\n§RSuch a grand restructuring of our artificery infrastructure would disturb any research currently underway - it might be best to wait until any current inventions are done being researched.§! "

 Y91_finish_mainland_conquest_title:0 "Conquer Odheongu"
 Y91_finish_mainland_conquest_desc:0 "If we wish to be considered the legitimate rulers of Odheongu, we must drive Daengun into the sea. Displaying our strength in such a way would certainly bring more Shuvüüsh to these lands and aid us in controlling the locals and integrating them in Guwaadun culture."

 Y91_develop_economy_title:0 "Develop Odheongu"
 Y91_develop_economy_desc:0 "Odheongu is a land rich in potential: the Menjeotaen, Chimbija and Sangsogha do not know how good they have it. Their land is fertile and fit for cultivation of tea, their coast brimming with fish and their mountains are laden with gold.\n\nDeveloping this land and increasing our state revenue would both aid ourselves financially and strengthen our grasp upon these lands, which will aid us in integrating them into our superior Guwaadun realm."

 Y91_build_Bhengudakhnar_temple_title:0 "Bhen-Ak Temple"
 Y91_build_Bhengudakhnar_temple_desc:0 "This land is a foreign one; instead of protecting themselves against harmful spirits, they aim to strike uneasy truces with them and let them possess their shamans.\n\nThese people are sick at worst and misguided at best. We must cleanse this land of their vile beliefs and cease their consorting with evil spirits. Let us build a grand temple to Bhengudakhnar, right in Bhengutai."

 Y91_somyonghon_cult_title:0 "Somyonghon Temple"
 Y91_somyonghon_cult_desc:0 "The isle of Somyonghon is home to many spirits the Bangujonsi consider to be cornerstones of their faith. It is also the only place where one can clearly commune with what perhaps can be considered the leading spirit of their faith, Menjaeng.\n\nThis fact paired with the isle being closer linked to the spirit world than almost anywhere else and the abundance of ancient ruins makes it worthy of a temple, so that our people of different faiths may benefit from this isle."

 Y91_capture_facestealer_title:0 "Capture a Facestealer"
 Y91_capture_facestealer_desc:0 "If we are to rid the Khaashalg desert of those wretched facestealing spirits and obtain vengeance for our ancestors, we must first capture one so we can study it.\n\nTo that end we should assemble a team of experts to capture one. We will need war-shamans, foreign mages, Rünsukhi guides, and an infantry regiment to protect them in the unforgiving desert."

 Y91_kill_facestealer_title:0 "Killing a Facestealer"
 Y91_kill_facestealer_desc:0 "Killing the captured facestealer has proven harder than previously thought. It truly seems that Jaal was a god even in life, being able to slay one singlehandedly. Even a team of shamans and foreign mages have proven inadequate to slay the spirit.\n\nSome of the foreign mages speak of so-called Spirit Hunters, from Xianjie. We should seek them out, and borrow their expertise."

 Y91_facestealer_killers_title:0 "A New Type Of Soldier"
 Y91_facestealer_killers_desc:0 "If we are to wage war against the facestealers, we shall need to train our own spirit hunters. Let us make the necessary investments."

 Y91_clear_first_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse The Lands"
 Y91_clear_first_runsukhi_desc:0 "With our newly trained Spirit Hunters and experienced shamans we can finally stand a chance against the facestealers.\n\nLet us send our armies into our piece of the Khaashalg desert and rid it of those wretched spirits!"

 Y91_clear_mountain_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Tolcuug hills"
 Y91_clear_mountain_runsukhi_desc:0 "The people of Tolcuug and Bhalooxi look at the land west of them with envy. The Rünsukhi land we have cleansed of the vile Facestealers is becoming more liveable every week.\n\nThere are almost no Facestealers left there, and as a result there are less sandstorms and there is less death. The people of the Tolcuug hills now desperately wish for the same. We should prepare the armies."

 Y91_clear_egoongaam_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Egoongaam"
 Y91_clear_egoongaam_runsukhi_desc:0 "The Egoongaam clan of the most northern reach of our domain, separating us from the horsemen, has petitioned us to rid them of the Facestealers, like we did for their kinsmen."

 Y91_clear_lakefolk_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Soolinúk Lands"
 Y91_clear_lakefolk_runsukhi_desc:0 "The lands of the Soolinúk are both the most fertile and the most plagued by the Facestealers. The Soolinúk clan claims to know where they come from, saying that the closer you get to the Baztaishaak Mountains, the more Facestealers you see, especially near the central mountain.\n\nThey beg us to rid them of their Facestealers and afterwards seek out a potential point of origin in the mountains."

 Y91_into_the_mountain_title:0 "Into The Mountain"
 Y91_into_the_mountain_desc:0 "It is time to amass our armies at the pass the Soolinúk clan mentioned, the one where the Facestealers go into and come out of, which we have had patrols cover ever since we cleansed the Khaashalg desert.\n\nThe Rünsukhi have set up a logistical network for our troops to be supplied when they are guarding the pass, even in great numbers. We have trained more Spirit Hunters, hired foreign mages, trained both our shamans and our men, and with a powerful mage [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to lead the expedition, morale will be higher than ever. We are ready - it is time to get our revenge."

 Y91_inward_perfection_title:0 "Inward Perfection"
 Y91_inward_perfection_desc:0 "With The Maskbreaker Rebellion behind us, it is now time for a period of reform, a period of calm and inward perfection.\n\nLet us stabilize our grasp upon the Yan, fortify our borders, reform our military, bolster our economy, and rework our laws and institutions."

 Y91_great_daxugo_legal_code_title:0 "Great Daxugo Legal Code"
 Y91_great_daxugo_legal_code_desc:0 "The Yan people have as many sets of laws as they have surnames. Before us lies the seemingly insurmountable task of unifying all these people under one great book of law.\n\nThe Great Daxugo Legal Code must be familiar to all Yan, yet serve Daxugo foremost. Let us start by establishing a definition of a citizen and setting up racial laws."

 Y91_articles_on_government_title:0 "Articles On Government"
 Y91_articles_on_government_desc:0 "The advisors of the realm have constantly been bothering [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] about details like local autonomy, representation of citizenry, nobility, and clans. It seems we cannot continue writing our laws before first establishing how the state itself will function."

 Y91_war_and_faith_title:0 "War Codified"
 Y91_war_and_faith_desc:0 "If [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has learned anything during these formative months, it is that the codes on war conduct have the potential to tear our great Diguó in two, much like the time of the Maskbreaker Rebellion.\n\nThe traditional Dìguómáo of the steppes demand the military law be written according to our ancient ways, whilst the National Academy based in Jianshu has many influential members arguing for quite the opposite."

 Y91_faith_code_title:0 "Faith Codified"
 Y91_faith_code_desc:0 "The time has come to incorporate our religious convictions into the very constitution of our great nation. Such laws can aid either in rooting out hostile faiths, or ensuring our subjects feel represented, regardless of belief."

 Y91_introduce_code_title:0 "Introduce Legal Code"
 Y91_introduce_code_desc:0 "With the Great Daxugo Legal Code finalised, it is time to publish the codes and make sure every governor has access to a copy. Let us hope our millions upon millions of subjects all find the codes satisfactory."

 Y91_daxugo_unshaken_title:0 "Daxugo Unshaken"
 Y91_daxugo_unshaken_desc:0 "We have come out of this period of unrest stronger than ever, our state reformed, away from all troublesome horde heritage, but holding on to what keeps us strong."

 Y91_outward_gaze_title:0 "Outward Gaze"
 Y91_outward_gaze_desc:0 "Our state is now in such a position where most issues inherent to our historical predicaments have been solved, and as such we can no longer be content with just our new homeland.\n\nOur state hungers for expansion, our mages hunger for artifacts, and our generals wish to prove themselves across Halann. It is time to gaze outward, like a true empire."

 Y91_plugging_the_holes_title:0 "Plugging The Holes"
 Y91_plugging_the_holes_desc:0 "If our state is going to stand the tests of time, we must ensure that any war fought to preserve ourselves is undertaken with as many advantages as possible. To this end we should ensure that our forts cover all angles of minor angles of approach, so we can afterwards focus on the main angle, the West-Yanshen border."

 Y91_the_yanshen_wall_title:0 "West-Yanshen Wall"
 Y91_the_yanshen_wall_desc:0 "With the minor holes in the border of our mainland plugged, it is time to focus on our western lands. Regardless of whether it is deemed necessary right now, it will no doubt be a vital investment in the long run: A great line of forts along the West-Yanshen border, from the Demon Hills to Bianfang and from Bianfang to the Phokhao Range."

 Y91_city_line_title:0 "Yanhe City Line"
 Y91_city_line_desc:0 "The great cities of the Yanhe are home to the plurality of our subjects - no river in the world has more people along it, as far as we know. We should make sure these cities are all fortified in such a way that they can not easily fall into enemy hands, whilst also ensuring enemy supply lines are disrupted, should they attempt to cross over the main vein of our empire."

 Y91_steppe_line_title:0 "The Steppe Line"
 Y91_steppe_line_desc:0 "The temples in Zougzengom require protection from foreign invaders, and the great city of Jiantsiang could use likewise protection, through the hills of Lipshu. Let us create a northern line to ensure our empire has one more line of forts to call upon in times of need."

 Y91_increase_tea_production_title:0 "Increase Tea Production"
 Y91_increase_tea_production_desc:0 "Some resources and products are very scarce in our land; tea is not one of them. Whatever tea we do not drink ourselves - and we drink a lot - always finds willing buyers abroad.\n\nIf we wish to establish ourselves forever as the main tea producers of the world, some investments are in order."

 Y91_reform_gold_standard_title:0 "The Gold Reforms"
 Y91_reform_gold_standard_desc:0 "Gold is an incredibly valuable resource; it adorns our temples, beautifies our regalia, and is used as a secondary currency throughout the realm. This last fact is a problem however, according to some of the most prominent economic advisors.\n\nInflation related to trading in an ever increasing supply in gold will continue to decrease the trust in our currencies and devalue our monetary systems. It is time to regulate the trading in gold and form new laws to halt inflation."

 Y91_expand_sugarfarms_title:0 "Expand Sugarfarms"
 Y91_expand_sugarfarms_desc:0 "Unlike tea, sugar is a resource often imported into our realm from abroad, as the only significant sugar producing region in our realm are the cane fields of Lamcue. We should attempt to expand these fields with government stimulus and also spread these canes through the realm, so other regions may begin cultivating this valuable resource as well."

 Y91_silk_road_title:0 "The Silk Road"
 Y91_silk_road_desc:0 "Our grasp on the silk market is a tight one; only the sericulture of Sramaya in Bhuvauri can hope to compete in both quality and quantity. Our nobility wears silk exclusively grown near the Yanhe, yet other nobles in Haless shamefully wear robes of low quality imitations or even cloth and wool.\n\nLet us elevate the entire continent to a higher state of fashion by bolstering our production and spreading word of our silk to far lands, across the ancient road of Jaher."

 Y91_anti_corruption_reforms_title:0 "Corruption Reforms"
 Y91_anti_corruption_reforms_desc:0 "Our administration consists of many different peoples: Daxug, Odheongu, Yan and even Harimari fill posts in our administration. All the different languages, offices, and laws of the past have caused a corruption problem.\n\nIf we are to rid ourselves of this problem for good, we must infiltrate our own administrators and carve out the rotten parts with diligence."

 flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.1.d:0 "The Nuugdan Tsarai have long been the most powerful clan of the Shuvüüsh, though it has stood fractured since the Sun Elves reigned over us, their officials fostering rivalries between the minor clans to keep us divided and weak. What was once the terror of Yanshen devolved into warring clans, families, tribes and hordes more of a threat to themselves than anybody else.\n\nRecently however, we saw the rise of Kusheng Nurgai of the Bagaatun clan, who grew up to as the Izhuun of the Bagaatun, having the final say in all matters spiritual, but had found herself inheriting the Bagatuun clan. Her horde stabilised and united all the minor clans of Nuugdan Tsarai within a few short years, and she earned the respect of her people by subjugating the other two clans, Tuiista Jaal and Rüng Oedek, and finally bringing down the fortifications of Tzunguan, which had repelled us for centuries. All of the world now trembles, for we have crowned a Faceless Queen."

 flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.2.d:0 "Odheongu is a region rich in history and tradition, much of it quite similar to our own due to the influence of the first kingdom of Guwaamud. It is us who are being influenced this time around however, our children are raised by Odheongun retainers and educated by native mentors, many speaking their language before learning the tongue of their ancestors.\n\nAs the Shuvüüsh of Guwaamud embrace more and more of the eastern culture, we are faced with a decision; either we embrace the winds of change and continue to nurture this trend to ingratiate ourselves with our subjects, or we uphold our own traditions which allowed our forefathers to conquer this land."

As thousands make their way to Zougzengom to visit her grave and pay their respects, the locals begin constructing a temple around it. Whilst the people were in mourning however, the shamans of the Saanorgegh communities were busy asking the spirit world for guidance.\n\nTo their surprise a familiar voice answered. The Faceless Queen is still alive, in the heavens! She has ascended to godhood according to a majority of the shaman and in her honor a new mask has been carved to be laid upon her grave, one devoid of all details, a true faceless mask for a faceless queen.\n\nSeveral rumors are floating around the clans, such as that she has married one of the three brothers, with shamans bickering about which one it could be. She is quickly becoming the preferred deity for all Shuvüüsh women as they pray to her for guidance.\n\n§R The Faceless Queen is now available as a personal deity to all QUEENS who control her temple in Zougzengom.§!"

 flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.4.d:0 "With the reconquest of Odheongu, ancient scriptures about a long forgotten god named Bhengudak have been unearthed from libraries all over the land. These documents speak of a god that used to watch over the previous iteration of Guwaamud for over 800 years, the god being the old former ruler of Guwaamud, ascended. This god has long been viewed as either dead or dormant.\n\nWith the recent departure of our previous ruler however, this is no longer the case. Shamans across the lands have reported that they can now commune with a new being, one which identifies itself as Bhengudakhnar, which means Bhengudak and child. It seems as if the two Shuvüüsh rulers that both have formed Guwaamud, both in the past and in the present, have now merged into a single living deity.\n\nAs shamans receive visions of their messages, a new mask has been carved to represent him. Both rulers were famous in life for subjugating those of other faiths and conquering with impunity; as such, those of us who would rather spread the faith by the terrorbird than the mouth are beginning to claim him as their guiding deity.\n\n§R Bhengudakhnar is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control his temple in Bhengutai.§!"

Occasionally a spirit wanders in from the desert and is turned away by local shamans.\n\nHowever, recently a group of families have arrived at the capital, claiming to be from the desert, and they're begging for food. Their old fashioned clothing, thick accents, and archaic vocabulary seem to support their claim.\n\nTheir clan leader says he represents a larger group of desert people, who all call themselves Rünsukhi. They say that the dry summers of the past few years have forced them to seek help. The rivers ran dry and they were forced to venture further from the homes to find food, losing many clansmen to the face stealing spirits in the process. They wish to join our great nation; they desire to purchase food from our markets and they claim to have access to gold mines and salt lakes to pay for it.

Actual human faces were embedded into the wall, made from flesh and stuck in a permanent expression of pain and panic. As the party went further down into the cave, the density of these faces on the walls, ceiling and floor increased, until the faces were so plentiful the shamans had to discuss if continuing to trample on our ancestors was sacrilege or permitted.\n\nAfter what felt like an hour of walking over the faces of their dead kinsmen the cave finally widened into a final room, its walls completely filled with faces. In the center of the room were hundreds of small, almost childlike Facestealers, who gave little resistance to spirit hunters. It was finally over - the home of the Facestealers was now under human control.

Apparently a group of Yan have traveled to the steppes and over the course of several weeks have been raiding terrorbird breeding farms.\n\nThe Dìguómáo have caught and executed most, after painful interrogations. Both the interrogations and the tattoos on their bodies seem to indicate they were part of a Jiangyang splinter group of the Maskbreakers, one of the primary groups of anti-Daxugo Yan rebels."

When it happened a third time, it became clear we were being hexed by powerful mages.\n\nOur mages casted protective spells and tried to divine the curses’ source, quickly realizing they came from the Beikling. Further investigation has shown that there is a vast network of Lefthand Path mage circles spread out through the hilly lands, all united under a single banner, calling themselves the Maskhexers.\n\nOur mages and special units of the Dìguómáo are hunting down these circles, but it might take a while."

 flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.67.d:0 "As our new administrative structure begins to take shape it is becoming painfully obvious that the Yan we have subjugated have not yet come to terms with their new overlords. Reports of small scale revolts are spreading through the country, with organized sabotage disrupting our logistics. Some rebels seem to be organizing around the symbol of a shattered mask, if rumors on the street are to be believed.\n\nVarious factions have sent demands to our government, radicals say there will be bloodshed unless we grant them independence, whilst the Yan nobles and guilds put forth more agreeable, yet expensive demands. Our administrative advisors have tried to compile an exhaustive list of demands made by the somewhat more reasonable Yan factions, theorizing that our empire might fall like Guwaamud of old if we do not begin preparing for civil strife immediately. Daxug generals and advisors agree that meeting the demands of certain factions is fruitful, but that malcontents will rise regardless, simply because we are seen as a foreign conqueror. Starting to work towards meeting the demands now that we still live in a time of relative peace will no doubt help our future administration in calming down the expected period of unrest when [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] passes away."

When the celebrations ended they planned to come together again in fifty years time.\n\nThis tradition has been a part of the Shuvüüsh identity ever since, a festival of unity in a people so often divided. There were years where the festival did not take place, due to war, animosity, and disease, but this year will not be one of those.\n\nThe Hekuudzoungh festival started as a great jousting event, and whilst nowadays there are many activities such as political and religious gatherings, the main event is still a competition of martial skill in which the leader and heir of every clan can participate.
