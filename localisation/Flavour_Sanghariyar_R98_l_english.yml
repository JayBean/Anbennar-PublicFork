 #Events
 sanghariyar.0.t:0 "The Promise of Nationalism"
 sanghariyar.0.desc:0 "When the Phoenix Empire came to Rahen, they came to us first. When they beat their retreat back to Bulwar, they left us last. For long we suffered under the elven yoke. Even once they retreated, they did not leave us fully, rather installing their favorite collaborators and preferred flunkies into high office. Emulation of the Phoenix Empire in government and culture was popular during this era, the armies and taxes organized as Jaher had organized them.\n\nThe people suffered during this time, of course they did. Future historians will quibble over that fact, they will say that people were no better or worse then than they are now. We know better: the elves did not care for us, and their emulants did not either. Feelings of anti-Phoenix sentiment grew, even as their remnants the Jaddari consistently threatened reinvasion from the west. These feelings of cultural unity in the face of an oppressor (a true Raghamideshi identity) began among the literate castes first, but over time began to trickle down to even the lowest of the low.\n\nEventually, the dam broke. In some cities it was peaceful, in others there was violence. Surprisingly, very few rulers were actually killed—most stepped down after they saw the writing on the wall. Everywhere the same voice, the same goal: the only ones worthy of ruling the Raghamideshi cities are the Raghamidesh! And so the elves and their remnants were overtoppled, replaced with more traditional, local forms of rule. And should those goals not be extended to one another? Should not there be a single Raghamidesh state to rule over all five cities?"

Perhaps it's fate that this month is [GetMonth], and you will once again be fighting for our freedom... Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from cultural annihilation. We are fighting for our right to live in our home. To exist. And should we win the day, [GetMonth] will no longer be known as a Peridot holiday, but as the day the dwarven world declared in one voice: "We will not go quietly into the night!"
