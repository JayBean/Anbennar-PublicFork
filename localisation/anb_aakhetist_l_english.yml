 aakhetist.05.t:0 "The Bronze Dragon Returns"
 aakhetist.05.d:0 "For most historians, Kheterata's history with Aakhet the Bronze ends in 488. The great dragon rarely ever took to his true draconic form, but instead preferred to lead armies as a human. His conquests as ruler of Kheterata following Dragonwake saw them conquer most of Bulwar, until he was dragged beneath the sands by the Sand Demon of the Salahad.\n\nBut not everyone believed that was his end. These bronze dragon fanatics, or Aakhetists as they were commonly called, believed he fled the Sand Demon to hide amongst the people of Kheterata. He would occasionally resurface, disguised as a great general, to lead their armies in battle, before disappearing back into the streets to mingle amongst the population once again. This belief was especially popular amongst the military brotherhoods of the Ahati, as well as the people of Irsmahap, and the southern soldiers in Aramoole. They believed that, if they remained loyal to him, Aakhet the Bronze would return to save them at their most dire hour.\n\nAnd that is what happened. After the successful siege of Golkora by gnolls of Gnollakaz in 1439, Kheterata split in two. Panic spread across Khetapera. For those who lived around the southern fortress in Aramoole, the threat of the lizardfolk to the south became more pressing now they no longer had the guarantee that Kheterata soldiers would reinforce them in the event of an invasion. Even the finest castle will eventually fall to a protracted siege without backup. It was at that moment, when the senior military staff of Aramoole gathered to discuss how to defend its borders, that one amongst them revealed himself to be Aakhet.\n\nWith Aakhet guiding our hands, nothing can block our path. We will repel any lizardfolk invasion, unite the Tijarikheti people, and march up the Sorrow to reclaim the Mandate of the Khet. Kheterata shall once again be united under the guidance of the Bronze Dragon!"
 aakhetist.05.a:0 "Glory to Aakhet"
