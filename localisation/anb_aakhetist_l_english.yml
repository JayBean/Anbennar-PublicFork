 ###events

 aakhetist.cancel:0 "Perhaps now isn't the best time."

 aakhetist.01.t:0 "The Bronze Dragon"
 aakhetist.01.d:0 "Just before dusk, as the merchants in the capital's market started to pack up their stalls, the clouds overhead parted with a sharp crack of lightning, illuminating a terrifying monstrous creature in the sky. The creature dropped into a dive, descending towards the city centre as onlookers panicked, hiding beneath tables and fleeing inside. With a roar the creature lifted out of their dive, and another crack of lightning struck the ground behind it, lighting up the giant figure for all to see: a great bronze dragon. A loud, booming voice, that appeared to emanate from everywhere at once, spoke:\n\n"My people! I have heard your calls. I have watched over your prayers, enjoyed your gifts, and attended your festivals. I have been impressed by your bravery, your loyalty, and your honor. That is why I have answered your call."\n\nOne final crack of lightning hit the great dragon's horn, and a whirlwind of flame swirled around Him. Its form shifted and morphed until it hit the ground, turning into a figure of a man in full formal military regalia, adorned with countless insignias, and clothed in a short cape with a symbol of the bronze dragon spread across its back. He raised his hands to the crowd and beckoned them all towards Him. "Fear no more, for your prayers have been answered. For I, terror of the Sorrow, the conqueror of the Salahad, great Bronze Dragon Aakhet, has returned!"\n\nThe cheer started small, but as the word started to spread, more and more people ran to the city centre to greet their god. Some who saw His figure collapsed on the floor and wept, overwhelmed by their joy in knowing their prayers had been answered. Soon the entire country knew the glorious truth. Aakhet has returned."
 aakhetist.01.a:0 "Glory to Aakhet! Glory to [Root.GetName]!"
 aakhetist.01.tooltip:0 "§YNew religious actions§! are available"

 aakhetist.02.t:0 "Losing Favor"
 aakhetist.02.d:0 "Aakhet has been curiously absent lately. Tracking His whereabouts is understandably difficult, given His penchant for shapeshifting and ability to fly. That is, until he revealed to one of the servants at the palace that he had been visiting Aakhetists in different lands and had been thoroughly impressed by their devotion."
 aakhetist.02.a:0 "Have we not paid Him enough attention?"

 aakhetist.03.t:0 "Abandoned"
 aakhetist.03.d:0 "Gone. His chambers where he slept are empty, with most of the clothes missing. The old granary where he stored His collection of weapons was empty. His face, in any of His forms, was nowhere to be found. Some are still convinced he's hiding amongst us, disguised as always, watching over our people. But you know the truth. You have disappointed the Bronze Dragon for the last time."
 aakhetist.03.a:0 "Aakhet has abandoned us!"
 aakhetist.03.tooltip:0 "We can no longer access §YAakhet's Blessings§!"

 aakhetist.04.t:0 "Calling the Dragon"
 aakhetist.04.d:0 "We know he's out there. The Bronze Dragon. Elikhet reborn. He who once led His people to glory. The great dragon Aakhet. We know he walks among us in disguise, judging our capabilities, waiting to see if we are worthy of His presence - of standing beneath His wings.\n\nFor now, all we can do is praise His name, hold festivals in His honor, and leave out gifts for him. Some call us foolish, but we know for certain he's watching us. We just need to prove to Him that we're ready to be led. "
 aakhetist.04.a:0 "He is watching us"
 aakhetist.04.tooltip:0 "For now all we can do is §Toffer tribute§! to §YAakhet§! and hope he joins us in §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Once His approval reaches §Y100§!, further tribute will sabotage His §Ycurrent host's§! relations with Him."

 aakhetist.05.t:0 "The Bronze Dragon Returns"
 aakhetist.05.d:0 "For most historians, Kheterata's history with Aakhet the Bronze ends in 488. The great dragon rarely ever took to his true draconic form, but instead preferred to lead armies as a human. His conquests as ruler of Kheterata following Dragonwake saw them conquer most of Bulwar, until he was dragged beneath the sands by the Sand Demon of the Salahad.\n\nBut not everyone believed that was his end. These bronze dragon fanatics, or Aakhetists as they were commonly called, believed he fled the Sand Demon to hide amongst the people of Kheterata. He would occasionally resurface, disguised as a great general, to lead their armies in battle, before disappearing back into the streets to mingle amongst the population once again. This belief was especially popular amongst the military brotherhoods of the Ahati, as well as the people of Irsmahap, and the southern soldiers in Aramoole. They believed that, if they remained loyal to him, Aakhet the Bronze would return to save them at their most dire hour.\n\nAnd that is what happened. After the successful siege of Golkora by gnolls of Gnollakaz in 1439, Kheterata split in two. Panic spread across Khetapera. For those who lived around the southern fortress in Aramoole, the threat of the lizardfolk to the south became more pressing now they no longer had the guarantee that Kheterata soldiers would reinforce them in the event of an invasion. Even the finest castle will eventually fall to a protracted siege without backup. It was at that moment, when the senior military staff of Aramoole gathered to discuss how to defend its borders, that one amongst them revealed himself to be Aakhet.\n\nWith Aakhet guiding our hands, nothing can block our path. We will repel any lizardfolk invasion, unite the Tijarikheti people, and march up the Sorrow to reclaim the Mandate of the Khet. Kheterata shall once again be united under the guidance of the Bronze Dragon!"
 aakhetist.05.a:0 "Glory to Aakhet"
 aakhetist.05.tooltip:0 "As long as §YAakhet§! approves of us, He will remain in §Y[Root.GetName]§! where He can directly aid us.\nWe should ensure His approval remains high by giving Him §Ttribute§!"


 aakhetist.20.t:0 "Submission"
 aakhetist.20.d:0 "To show our devotion to Aakhet, our rulers must submit to Him and pledge allegiance to His cause. The submission ceremony is usually just a simple prayer said beneath the shade of a tree, said to demonstrate standing beneath Aakhet's wings.\n\nFor a ruler though, it is tradition that they must strip and prostrate themselves upon the grass, showing their willingness to give up everything and follow Aakhet. It's a humbling ceremony that is designed to ensure no king sees themselves as above Aakhet."
 aakhetist.20.a:0 "I pledge my devotion to Aakhet"

 aakhetist.21.t:0 "A Feast for a Dragon"
 aakhetist.21.d:0 "Aakhet's reign was known not just for its military conquests, but for its great festivals. Aakhet himself never officially attended them, but it was an open secret that he would attend in disguise. In honor to Aakhet, let us hold a new feast in His name. Empty the storehouses, slaughter our finest cattle, and throw a party that will be spoken of in legend for its revelry! Perhaps, if we are lucky, Aakhet himself will turn up."
 aakhetist.21.a:0 "It will take years for the town to recover"

 aakhetist.22.t:0 "A Bronze Hoard"
 aakhetist.22.d:0 " Dragons love to hoard, and Aakhet is no different. However, as befitting of His reputation, the Bronze Dragon's hoard was not one of gold or gems, but of weaponry. A collection of swords, staffs, spears, and even gunpowder contraptions are all part of His collection. Purchase the finest weapons to gift to Him, and perhaps we shall win His favor."
 aakhetist.22.a:0 "I hope he doesn't already have these"

 aakhetist.23.t:0 "Collection of Knowledge"
 aakhetist.23.d:0 "The Bronze Telegraph was a form of telegraphy used during the Kheteratan Dragon Wars, and was a large part of why Aakhet's conquest was so successful. Through a complicated set of light signalling using large bronze sheets, armies could communicate across large distances very quickly. Although the language of light signals died out, the idea of collecting information about latest military events in a written "telegraph" remained a tradition in aakhetist communities across generations."
 aakhetist.23.a:0 "Send out the Bronze Telegraph"

 aakhetist.24.t:0 "Worthy Advisor"
 aakhetist.24.d:0 "The reason we knew Aakhet was still amongst us and wasn't felled by the Sand Demon was because he would reveal His true form to recruit those he felt were special tactical geniuses. They would become part of His inner circle as he secretly rose through the ranks of whatever nation he had made a home in and led soldiers into battle. If we could do the hard work for Him and send Him our greatest military minds, perhaps he would repay us with His presence."
 aakhetist.24.a:0 "Go stand by His side"

 aakhetist.25.t:0 "Aakhet, Light in the Darkness"
 aakhetist.25.d:0 ""I have lived a millennia on this planet, seen civilisations rise and fall. I've seen their soldiers flee in terror from the battlefield at the first sight of doubt, for they lacked the courage, the will, the fortitude to fight. Most of all, they lacked a reason, pushed onto the battlefield by an uncaring lord, unprepared for the horrors that faced them.\n\nBut you are different, for you will fight alongside your lord. Your hearts will be filled with hope, knowing that you have a reason to fight. You fight for [Root.GetName]. You fight for the Bronze Dragon. You fight for me, as I fight for you. You are the dragonhearted, and glory shall be yours!""
 aakhetist.25.a:0 "Glory to Aakhet!"

 aakhetist.26.t:0 "Aakhet, Master of Men"
 aakhetist.26.d:0 "Aakhet's chambers are normally strictly off-limits to anyone without an explicit invitation. Which is why it was such a shock to see a group of around twenty different people all standing in the shadows behind Him as he sat at a table in the middle of the room, idly swirling a dagger between hands.\n\n"I can never trust the generals hired by a king. Nepotism and bribery dictate who gets to lead far too often. That is why I find talented advisors myself to help me with my decisions." He stabbed the dagger into the table, stood up and, with a dramatic swirl of His robes, snapped His fingers, lighting every candle in the room at once, revealing the faces of all those stood behind Him.\n\n"I am feeling generous. You may take a member of my Retinue. May they lead your forces to glory. I'm sure they will do better than anyone you currently employ.""
 aakhetist.26.a:0 "They will lead our forces in battle"

 aakhetist.27.t:0 "Aakhet, Burner of Worlds"
 aakhetist.27.d:0 "The skies have once again been graced by the Bronze Dragon!\n\nWith a piercing roar he swept down across the battlements, burning all in His wake. Rock and stone melted wherever His flames struck. Where thousands of our men would have been lost if we attempted to scale these castle walls, Aakhet destroyed them in an instance. He swooped down in front of the besieging troops as they chanted His name, landing in front of them and belching a fireball into the air as the soldiers cheered.\n\nAakhet lowered His head down next to the general and spoke in a whisper that nevertheless was perfectly audible for miles around: "Do not make a habit of this request. I prefer to give our enemies a chance.""
 aakhetist.27.a:0 "Burn!"

 aakhetist.28.t:0 "Aakhet, Destroyer of Legions"
 aakhetist.28.d:0 "Under the light of the moon he struck. With His scales flickering under the fires he lit below, the forces of [event_country.GetName] were terrorized through the night by the Bronze Dragon. This was no indiscriminate destruction though. Aakhet's rage is not a mindless fury, but a deathly strike of precision into the heart of His enemies. One by one, each general leading the [event_country.GetAdjective] forces were set alight by Aakhet, before pulling out of His fiery dive and soaring back into the sky, onto His next foe."
 aakhetist.28.a:0 "The path has been cleared for our forces"
 aakhetist.28.tooltip1:0 "§YAakhet§! thinks killing so many generals trivializes this war"
 aakhetist.28.tooltip2:0 "§YAakhet§! is disappointed we had to rely on Him to fight a measely mage"
 aakhetist.28.tooltip3:0 "§YAakhet§! is displeased He had to kill the enemy ruler in such a simple manner"

 aakhetist.28.tooltip4:0 "All their §Ygenerals§! will burn!"

 aakhetist.29.t:0 "Aakhet, Subjugator of Realms"
 aakhetist.29.d:0 "Aakhet's military briefings are unpredictable. Often they will be an excuse for Him to reminisce about old conquests. Sometimes he will come up with a scheme so elaborate, not a single general in the room could follow it, leaving the plans unfulfilled and Aakhet frustrated.\n\nThis plan was different. In a few simple steps, he outlined exactly how you could decapitate the leadership of [event_country.GetName] and bring it under our control in a single war. The genius of it was in its simplicity. Sometimes over a thousand years of expertise in military campaigns does bear fruit."
 aakhetist.29.a:0 "We shall bring them to heel!"

 aakhetist.30.t:0 "Aakhet, Benevolent Teacher"
 aakhetist.30.d:0 "If Aakhet was to be found around the palace, it was usually arguing with frightened generals in the war room. But today Aakhet was standing in the courtyard, watching the heir to the throne brandish a small wooden sword, barking out orders on how the heir's stance was all wrong. It was rare for the dragon to be away from the battlefield for an extended period of time like this. It seemed the lord's pleading to train their heir in the art of war had worked."
 aakhetist.30.a:0 "Learn from the best"

 aakhetist.31.t:0 "Aakhet, Glorious Majesty"
 aakhetist.31.d:0 "When Aakhet invited you to His chambers for a duel to see if you were worthy, you had mentally prepared yourself for what you thought was every eventuality. What you weren't prepared for was the sight of the Bronze Dragon himself, seated at a small table in His normal human form, shuffling a deck of playing cards.\n\n"There's only three creatures known to have ever killed a khet." Aakhet beckoned you towards the seat opposite Him. "Me, the demonic Xhazobine, and another khet. The khetarch likes to keep that final one hidden, as two khet fighting each other is a terrible sight to behold. Instead, when there are disagreements between khet, they fight using an elaborate game of monster summoning. I've always been fascinated by this game, and created my own version with these playing cards."\n\nHe placed a deck of cards on the opposite side of the table and invited you to look through them. "Unfortunately new players are very hard to come by, and I hate playing against khet. They are terribly sore losers." He placed His deck face down, then steepled His fingers and gazed at you across the table. "But you intrigue me. I think you may have the mind to master this game.""
 aakhetist.31.a:0 "It's time to duel!"
 aakhetist.31.tooltip:0 "Let the games begin"


 aakhetist.33.t:0 "Turn One"
 aakhetist.33.d1:0 "Aakhet picked a card out of His hand and slapped it dramatically down on the table between you. "I play the Sand Demon of the Salahad. A powerful monster indeed. Some say it even killed me, although as you can tell by my presence here today, it was at best a draw.""
 aakhetist.33.d2:0 "Aakhet picks a card out of His hand and shows it to you. "The Jar of Greed. It lets me draw two new cards. A fitting card for a game made by the khet, don't you think". He chuckles at His own joke while drawing His new cards."
 aakhetist.33.a:0 "Shadow Magician"
 aakhetist.33.tooltip1:0 "This card is a §Tpowerful§! monster"

 aakhetist.35.t:0 "Turn Two"
 aakhetist.35.d1:0 " "I play the Loyal Kobold, which allows me to play a trap card from my hand. I've never been too fascinated by kobolds myself, but I have certainly heard about their ingenuity in the realm of devious snares." He went to place the card on the table, but paused, looking at the art on it.\n\n"Curious. I copied these designs from the large stone slabs used by the khets. Looking at it now, this appears to be a bronze kobold. I didn't create any, did I? Where would they have spawned? Maybe in the Salahad? Or in the Khetapera mountains? Surely not beneath the pyramid?"\n\nAakhet drummed His fingers on the table, staring intently at the card for a few seconds, before shrugging and placing it down on the table along with His face-down trap card. "It's probably just a miscolored gold kobold"."
 aakhetist.35.d2:0 " Aakhet starts shuffling cards around in His hand, before grinning to himself. He places a single card face-down on the table. "This trap card is all I have for you this turn, but it's all I need to keep me safe for now. You will not be ready for the storm coming for you next turn.""
 aakhetist.35.a:0 "Fissure"

 aakhetist.37.t:0 "Turn Three"
 aakhetist.37.d1:0 "Finally, I can play this card" proclaims a clearly delighted Aakhet. "I play Dragonwake! With this card I can summon every dragon card in my hand. Come forth, Nimrith the Red, Zaamalot the Black, and Alos the Copper." The room itself began to shake, as draconic forms swirled around the table. Aakhet's eyes started to glow, and you swore you could see flames flicker beneath His grin. "My brothers and sisters return to me for this game. None of them survived until the end of Dragonwake, but I doubt you can survive your next turn.""
 aakhetist.37.d2:0 " "First I play Astral Terror. This allows me to summon Eztarthul from my hand, which lets me search for a Damestear card from my deck. From there I can now summon…"\n\nAt this point you lose track of what Aakhet is saying, as he carefully explains every move he makes, interspersing His explanations with various pieces of historical knowledge and personal stories of battles and dragons he has met over the ages. You're fairly sure he's just making up rules as he goes along, but you don't dare challenge Him. The entire turn takes over five minutes before he finally plays His last card.\n\n"...which means I can fuse all three together to create the Eldritch Dragon of Yore - a dragon I believe was invented by Septkhet to scare young khets into fearing dragons. Hah! It was the bronze dragon he should have watched out for." You stare down at the horrific monstrosity of a dragon on the card before you, with stats far higher than any other card you had seen in the game so far."

 aakhetist.38.t:0 "The End"
 aakhetist.38.d1:0 "Aakhet peers at the last card you played, before bursting out into laughter. "If your strategy was to make a play so bad it would cause me to forfeit out of pity, then that was indeed the right card to play." He continues to laugh while the room around you starts to get darker. Shadows start to creep into the corner of your vision. A terror starts to come over you, realising that perhaps you should not have engaged in a game played by gods.\n\n"Do you know what the khet used to do to their subjects who lost at this game? They would be sent to the Shadow Plane, to be amongst the death and decay that inhabits that world. I sought to recreate their game in a near identical fashion". The room around you started to shake more violently, until without warning, it all stopped, leaving just you and a smirking Aakhet sitting across a table.\n\n"But that aspect is not something I put in my version of their game. Now begone from my quarters. If this is the best your people can put forward in a game with the gods, then they need you alive to lead them, lest they fail to put one foot in front of the other each day.""
 aakhetist.38.d2:0 "Your final move completely blindsides Aakhet. His last turn emptied His hand, and now he's got nothing left to play. "Hah, don't go celebrating just yet" he says, temporarily regaining His composure and drawing a new card. "For I believe in the heart of the…this card is worthless!" He hurls the final card with so much force it embeds in the wall. For a second you start to worry, thinking maybe you should have let Aakhet win so your life would be spared. But instead the dragon lets out a large belly laugh.\n\n"That was a good game! It's been a while since I've had this much fun. Almost as long as it's been since someone defeated me in battle. The people of [Root.GetName] are in good hands with you in charge.""

Our defences are in ruins, and it won't be long until the castle falls."
 aakhetist.39.a:0 "Curse that dragon"

 aakhetist.40.t:0 "Winged Death"
 aakhetist.40.d:0 "It struck in the dead of night. A great, bronze-scaled dragon swooped over our military encampments, torching the officer's sleeping quarters, before rising up from the flames and flying off into the night once again. This was no random attack, but a targeted assassination of each of our generals, leaving our military in disarray."
 aakhetist.40.a:0 "This war just got more difficult"
 aakhetist.40.tooltip:0 "All our §Ygenerals§! have been burnt!"

 aakhetist.50.t:0 "Truces are for the Weak"
 aakhetist.50.d:0 "At an intelligence report on the military capabilities of [event_country.GetName], Aakhet did something he regularly does, and piped up with an unhelpful suggestion. "Why do we not invade [event_country.GetName] now? They are weaker than ever from their latest conflicts. Now is the perfect time to strike." Everyone remained silent for several seconds, their eyes nervously shifting to one another, until the youngest soldier in the room spoke: "Because we have a truce with them your honor. It would be dishonorable to invade them at this point."\n\n"A truce?!"\n\nAakhet tipped His head back and gave one loud, piercing laugh. "Listen, truces are a social construct. There is no force preventing you from breaking them. If you feel bound by these meaningless treaties, then you merely mark yourself out as weak. We go to war comrades, or else we are but cowards!""
 aakhetist.50.a:0 "What a brilliant idea Aakhet"
 aakhetist.50.b:0 "We must honor our truce"

 aakhetist.51.t:0 "Time for Conquest"
 aakhetist.51.d:0 "It was an unusually peaceful day in [Root.Capital.GetName]. That is, until a deafening roar bellowed overhead as the Bronze Dragon descended from out of the light of the sun and into the middle of the marketplace, toppling stalls and sending merchants tumbling. Some tried to get down on their knees and offer a prayer, before being bowled over by the beating of His wings as he landed. The dragon sent up a whirlwind of flame as he shifted and transformed back into the stark naked figure of Aakhet.\n\n"We must invade [event_country.GetName] now!" yelled Aakhet, grabbing a robe that had been flung aside from an upended stall and gesturing furiously to the surrounding dishevelled crowd. "Their soldiers are weak, their leaders corrupt, and their people suffer beneath their unjust rule. We must not sit back and allow their weakness to continue unabated. We must show strength in this moment and strike not a moment too soon." Donning the robe, he pumped His fist in the air and cried: "To War!"\n\nThe crowd erupted into wild jubilation and Aakhet disappeared into the throng. By the time news of Aakhet's latest decree had reached the palace, the bronze dragon was nowhere to be found, having been last seen holding aloft what appeared to be a shoe filled with wine. Do we listen to His call, or hope he forgets by tomorrow?"
 aakhetist.51.a:0 "To War!"
 aakhetist.51.b:0 "Let's hope he forgets about this"

 aakhetist.52.t:0 "Weak Spawn"
 aakhetist.52.d:0 ""Come in" states the voice behind the door. You nervously push open the door to Aakhet's chambers and see Him sitting at a table, studying a book on the language of the Bulwari people, and writing on a sheet of parchment. You stand to attention for what feels like ten minutes before Aakhet finally stops writing and looks up at you, twirling the quill in His hand.\n\n"I was graciously sharing my untold knowledge of military history with your heir today, in hopes that they may one day assist in my goal of leading this nation to greatness. We got to the part about my incredible conquest of the Salahad Gate, and do you know what they said?" Aakhet's voice cracked slightly as he spoke. "They said they didn't care to hear about it." The quill in His hand snapped in two. He looked at it, cursed under His breath, before placing it down delicately and looking back up at you.\n\n"I have had many a leader disagree with me. They are always wrong, but I can appreciate their point of view. It shows a strong will to debate a dragon. What I cannot stand is one who is so profoundly ignorant that they do not wish to learn. Such a person cannot lead this country. I expect you to make the necessary arrangements to ensure this does not happen.""
 aakhetist.52.a:0 "As you wish Aakhet"
 aakhetist.52.b:0 "Maybe if they apologise this can all be brushed over"

 aakhetist.53.t:0 "Strategic Fortifications"
 aakhetist.53.d:0 "Military strategy meetings with Aakhet often run far longer than planned, but even by His standards this one was absurd. At least two generals had fallen asleep. One of the guards standing on duty had to be carried away due to exhaustion. There was likely nobody in the room bar the Bronze Dragon himself who even knew what the point of the meeting was anymore.\n\nCompletely unperturbed by His audience's lack of engagement, Aakhet continued His presentation. "...and I will personally see to the construction of this fortress, otherwise I do not believe it will meet the specifications outlined here today." Bleary-eyed, the crowd peered at the spot on the map Aakhet was pointing at. It was a large region of flat land, far away from any defensible terrain. "This will certainly be more costly to build than any previous defensive fortifications and naturally take time due to everything I outlined here. Damestear-infused crocodiles do not come cheap after all.""
 aakhetist.53.a:0 "Of course Aakhet, your genius knows no bounds"
 aakhetist.53.b:0 "Make up some excuse about budgets"

 aakhetist.54.t:0 "Pathetic Army"
 aakhetist.54.d:0 "One of a ruler's duties is to attend military processions to inspire the troops. Standing up and saluting the marching soldiers, you spot one soldier break ranks and start marching towards you. Panicking, you look to your guards, but every one appeared to have simultaneously got sand in their eyes, each of them blinded and rubbing at their faces. You fumble for your sword as what you're sure is an assassin strides up to you and salutes, before leaning in and growling in a tone you recognise instantly, even in this new form of his: Aakhet.\n\n"Your troops have clearly been taking inspiration from the khet. In my time amongst them, I have never met a more lazy, spoiled, worthless collection of supposed soldiers. We must disband each and every one in this battalion right now, and every one of our reserve units as well. For if we send them into battle, I fear they may poke their own eyes out before they injure an enemy." Aakhet stood up straight, saluted, and marched back towards the unit."
 aakhetist.54.a:0 "We must heed his wise words"
 aakhetist.54.b:0 "I'll pretend I didn't know who that was"

 aakhetist.55.t:0 "Whispers of the Foolish"
 aakhetist.55.d:0 "To be able to speak directly to one's god is a great honor, one few others in this world can claim to have. What was never made clear by your predecessor is how much of this time in conversation with said god would be spent listening to them complain.\n\n"Decrepit fools, each and every one of them." Aakhet slammed His fist on the table, leaving a smouldering mark behind, and taking a bite out of a chicken leg in His other hand. "If I have to hear the word 'budget' one more time, I may just start a second Dragonwake. Do these imbeciles not know you must spend gold to make gold? The measly debt accrued to expand will be dwarfed by the income we make in reparations post-conquest." The bone started to visibly char in His hand as he pointed it at you. "I want each and every one of your senior advisors tried for treason and blasphemy. They are trying to undermine my authority.""
 aakhetist.55.a:0 "They shall be removed from their positions promptly"
 aakhetist.55.b:0 "Give Aakhet a few days to calm down"

 aakhetist.56.t:0 "Worthy Warriors"
 aakhetist.56.d:0 " "Do you know what makes this nation great", said Aakhet, parading around a field in full military regalia. He was followed by a string of worried priests, curious onlookers, enraptured worshippers, and a cavalcade of advisors carrying maps of various battle plans. "Me, of course. But what else makes this nation great is our diversity. So many great people with so much to offer this country. I have been travelling the land, drilling our troops, and none have impressed me more than the soldiers in the former conquered territories."\n\nHe stopped suddenly in the middle of the field and slapped His forehead. "Of course, why didn't I think of this earlier? Sometimes my own ingenuity surprises me." Aakhet spun around, grabbed a map out of an advisor's pile of scrolls, and unfurled it on the ground in front of the crowd. He grabbed a knife and plunged it through a spot in our nation. "We should take advantage of their military prowess and release them from under our direct command as a march of our nation. They will not be able to flourish if we attempt to integrate them into our existing forces. Don't you all agree with my incredible plan?""
 aakhetist.56.a:0 "Of course Aakhet, what an amazing idea"
 aakhetist.56.b:0 "Let's keep them under our command for now"

 aakhetist.57.t:0 "Workers to Soldiers"
 aakhetist.57.d:0 "One of Aakhet's favorite pastimes was to attend military drills and complain about the new recruits. Normally he left satisfied that His critiques had been listened to and would be acted upon, but His latest visit appeared to have troubled Him far more than unusual. "Is this nation only good for trinkets for the rich? I cannot denounce the youths today, for they are not even given a chance. We have clearly spent too much time chasing gold instead of glory.\n\n"Look at the sorry state of this." Aakhet looked genuinely upset as he tossed a battered wooden shield on the floor. "This is the type of equipment our rookie soldiers are having to use during their drills. "I want those manufacturies torn down and new military training facilities built in their place. If I am to criticise the youths of today, I wish them to be at least given a chance to disappoint me.""
 aakhetist.57.a:0 "We shall begin their construction at once"
 aakhetist.57.b:0 "Those manufacturies are vital cogs in our economy"

 aakhetist.58.t:0 "Conjurers of Cheap Tricks"
 aakhetist.58.d:0 "A senior figure in the Mage Guild had just inadvertently said something extremely patronizing about Aakhet. The offending mage had been turned into little more than a smouldering pair of shoes by Aakhet, but judging by what the furious dragon had said afterwards, he was intending to pass some decree on the actions of the mages in [Root.GetName].\n\nA messenger marched into the hall, saluted, and handed over a piece of parchment with Aakhet's scrawl and official draconic seal. Inside contained a string of outrageous demands for the mages to comply to, including harsh restrictions on research, severely limiting recruitment, and massively expanded duties in assisting the military. Implementing all of this will damage the power and integrity of our mages for a long, long time. On the other hand, does one really want to get on Aakhet's bad side after what he did to that mage?"
 aakhetist.58.a:0 "Deliver Aakhet's decree at once. The mages must be punished"
 aakhetist.58.b:0 "It was just one mage and they've been dealt with"

 aakhetist.59.t:0 "An Unfavorable Alliance"
 aakhetist.59.d:0 " Glasses chimed as various dignitaries saluted the friendship between the nations of [Root.GetName] and [event_country.GetName]. This latest meeting was more ceremonial than practical, but its intent was to strengthen bonds between your two nations. Aakhet was in attendance, albeit in disguise, this time as one of the servers tending to the guests at the feast. Laughing at one of the visiting diplomat's awful jokes, you spied Aakhet furiously gesturing to you from the hall leading to the kitchen. Excusing yourself, you leave the table and step out to see what your god wanted to speak about.\n\n"That fool just revealed vital military secrets about our shared operations to me", said Aakhet in a furious whisper. "Little more than a polite question was all they needed to divulge such critical information. Can you imagine what other classified knowledge their imbecilic diplomats have revealed? I have never agreed with this alliance, and now I have evidence to show it is harming us more than it helps us. We cannot allow this farce to continue.""
 aakhetist.59.a:0 "We must end this alliance"
 aakhetist.59.b:0 "It was just one diplomat"

 aakhetist.60.t:0 "War Economy"
 aakhetist.60.d:0 "Sometimes Aakhet's presence at military drills inspired the soldiers to greater heights. Other times, such as today, it just made them nervous. After watching one soldier stumble and fail to stab the dummy correctly, Aakhet strode forward and took the knife from the stuttering recruit. "Do not fear, my adorable hatchlings, for I will show you the correct way to wield this weapon". In one dramatic flourish, he tossed the knife from one hand to the other, then swung it into the dummy. The knife completely failed to pierce its target, deflecting to one side and leaving the dummy unscathed.\n\nNobody dared move or make even the slightest noise as Aakhet stared down at the offending knife. He marched towards the terrified general in charge and held the knife up to their face. "I want all resources diverted to expanding the mines in [event_province2.GetName]. These weapons must be infused with sawdust due to shortages, for there is no other possible explanation for what we all witnessed today""
 aakhetist.60.a:0 "Divert our resources at once"
 aakhetist.60.b:0 "That weapon just needed sharpening"
