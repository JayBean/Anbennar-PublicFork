 corinite.1.t:0 "The Corinite Proclamation"
 corinite.1.d:0 "Many questions have risen with the recent revelation that Castellos, the ruling deity of the Regent Court, is dead: When exactly did he die? Can the texts in Aelantir be verified? Who will lead the Regent Court now?\n\nTraditionalists attempt to keep the peace, and say that Adean, Castellos' son and rightful heir will rise up and take his father's place.\nHowever, many of those who suffered under The Greentide claim that it was the Regent Court's neglect that led to the destruction of Escann and Castellyr, and a clear sign that if Castellos was alive, and that gods were capable, that The Greentide would've been averted - and that Castellos would've protected his patron kingdom like he did in aeons past.\n\nThe rising popularity of the recently ascended God of War, Corin, the heroine of the Greentide, has called for her divine succession onto the Regent Throne through her links as the de facto successor of Agrados, Castellos' deceased brother. The Corinites in $CAPITAL$ dispute that while Adean may be a noble and chivalric god, his time under Castellos' tutelage has made him conservative, hidebound, and ultimately unable to defend the Realm against its many external threats, and that the present system of divine regency is but a poor excuse for weak and unjust rulers to retain their power and ignore the monsters and tyrants lurking beyond their borders."
 corinite.1.a:0 "Only time will tell what this might bring"
 corinite.2.t:0 "The Crimson Deluge"
 corinite.2.d:0 "As the prophets of Corin spread her message across the continent, what can only be described as an apocalyptic scene has transpired in many parts of the Empire: the sky would darken, as if about to rain, only to open and release a torrent of blood onto the unsuspecting citizens. Horrified, crowds of people rushed through the streets, trying to escape from the plasma showers. Many were crushed and trampled as they attempted to escape what could only seem to be the end of the world. Whether someone acknowledges Corin or Adean as their divine mother or father, all agree that this is irrefutable evidence of a bloody and terrible war in the heavens themselves. It is only a matter of time that rivers are not fed by the blood of gods, but by the blood of men."
 corinite.2.a:0 "A dark omen of the usurper Corin attempting to do what Agrados once did!"
 corinite.2.b:0 "We must convert to Corin's faith to prevent more cataclysms!"
 corinite.2.c:0 "It's the end of the world!"
 corinite.2.e:0 "A sign of Corin's truth!"
 corinite.3.t:0 "The Crimson Deluge"
 corinite.3.d:0 "In many regions of Cannor a horrible rain has started. A rain of crimson blood. Almost all of Cannor east of the Dameshead is seeing regular rains of blood, causing chaos and flooding. Those affected say it must be a sign that the gods are fighting in the heavens, with Corin challenging Adean for his father's seat as ruler of the Regent Court. Reports of mass hysteria and violence is breaking out."
 corinite.3.a:0 "Corin's betrayal is destroying lives."
 corinite.3.b:0 "Corin's victory will save those regions."
 corinite.3.c:0 "Sucks for them!"
 corinite.4.t:0 "The Crimson Deluge is Over"
 corinite.4.d:0 "At last, after 10 years, the rains have stopped... and clarity seems to have returned to the land. They say the war between the gods is over... with no clear winner. The mortal world can now return to peace, but some say that the true winner of this war must now be decided by its followers..."
 corinite.4.a:0 "Adean is recovering, and is counting on us now."
 corinite.4.b:0 "Corin still lives, and soon, we must follow in her footsteps."
 corinite.4.c:0 "We can return to normal."
 corinite.5.t:0 "Resistance to Ravelianism"
 corinite.5.d:0 "We are the children of Corin. We have endured the Greentide and seen Corin's light. We endured the Crimson Deluge that nearly destroyed our lands, but instead, we persevered through faith.\n\nThe Ravelians, in their greed for the truth, have completely corrupted Corin's base goal of achieving peace and justice. Their so-called organized religion seeks to dominate and conquer all ways of life under their dogma, but we, as the children of Escann and inheritors of Escann, must resist this new tide of upheaval."
 corinite.5.a:0 "Through Her strength, we will stand strong."
 corinite.5.b:0 "Perhaps the Ravelians are a continuation of Corin's work?"
 corinite.100.t:0 "The Tenth Pantheonic Council"
 corinite.100.d:0 "There are rituals and forms associated with a Pantheonic council, laid down in the centuries since worship of the Regent Court was first codified. There must be a gathering of every deity's high priest. There must be at least seven days of discussion, a further seven days of debate. There are required rites of thanksgiving, of divination, of worship.\n\nThe Tenth Pantheonic Council does not follow these rules. It is a conclave of adventurer-clerics, a smattering from each deity, led by Dominic of Gallowspeak (lately of Nerat, now sworn to Corin). It is less a discussion than a proclamation: Corin was not slain in truth, but instead redeemed Agrados' failures and ascended to take that fallen god's place in the Court. Or perhaps it less a proclamation than a wildfire, spreading quick amongst the Escanni adventurers, following them back to their homes across Cannor, and there spreading like a spark in dry kindling.\n\nFinally, it seems the temples themselves have issued statements acceding to this truth, even as they quibble about Agrados' heresy and her status as avatar. Their slowness is an indictment when compared to Her fierce and unrelenting strength — it is clear that the goddess of war, bravery, and heroism is a much needed addition to the court."
 corinite.100.a:0 "May all find salvation under Her sword and shield."
 corinite.100.b:0 "We shall join her crusade!"
 corinite.101.t:0 "The Tenth Pantheonic Council?"
 corinite.101.d:0 "There are rituals and forms associated with a Pantheonic council, laid down in the centuries since worship of the Regent Court was first codified. There must be a gathering of every deity's high priest. There must be at least seven days of discussion, a further seven days of debate. There are required rites of thanksgiving, of divination, of worship.\n\nNone of those rules were followed in the so-called Tenth Pantheonic Council. It was a conclave of unruly adventurer-clerics, many barely literate in the teachings of their deity, led by the previously-unknown Dominic of Gallowspeak. It is less a discussion than wild speculation: Corin was not slain in truth, but instead moved beyond cursed Agrados' heresy and ascended to take that fallen god's place in the Court. Or perhaps it less a proclamation than a wildfire — these beliefs grew fast amongst Escanni adventurers, followed them back to their homes across Cannor, and there spread like a spark in dry kindling.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has well-noted the growing faith in Her ascension, and it seems today the temples themselves have issued statements agreeing to this status. They note further discussion is necessary about Her relationship to Agrados and all his failings, but they shall not stand before the tide. Let it be proclaimed across [Root.GetName], so all may learn that Corin has joined the Regent Court, as goddess of war, bravery, and heroism."
 corinite.101.a:0 "A newcomer to the Court."

 corinite.200.d:0 "The term "Corinite Crusader" is a loose term afforded to all those who fight in Corin's name. Their ranks swell with people of all backgrounds, but a great many can be simply counted as peasant rabble who fight for religion rather than their feudal lord, what is certain, however, is their unyielding zeal to spread Corin's justice across the land.\nWith our recent war prolonging the suffering of our people, large bands of crusaders have flocked to our banners, both in the army and in the supply train, hoping that the war may finally end with a righteous victor."

 corinite.201.d:0 "Maniacs! Corin's most zealous followers in [target_province.GetName] have taken up arms against their unbelieving neighbors. While their devotion to the faith is admirable, this time these zealots have gone too far. Is conversion on pain of death truly Corin's justice?"
 corinite.201.a:0 "Their love for Her has made them blind."
 corinite.202.t:0 "Career Priests Ousted"
 corinite.202.d:0 "Over time our ministers have noted that our clergy are becoming more and more inundated by firebrand priests of humble countryside roots. They claim to know the will of Corin more truly than those who have studied Her word, calling our seminaries and temples decadent and Adeanic."
 corinite.202.a:0 "The people know Her way, let them have their priests."
 corinite.202.b:0 "These tramps know nothing of Corin's justice!"
 corinite.203.t:0 "Independent Preachers"
 corinite.203.d:0 "A strong prosperous nation is often the benevolent patron of their relevant religious institutions, but with the rise of zealous behaviour in our ruler the people have come to look at Corin's ways with their own intepretations of our official dogma. Many self-proclaimed priests of Corin, often self-taught, have appeared across our country, preaching her good word. While many are no doubt of pure intent, these independent preachers can border on misintepretation, or worse, heresy, or even rile the masses and set them against our rule."
 corinite.203.a:0 "Send them to the seminary, or send them from our lands."
 corinite.203.b:0 "I can hardly complain, they do Her work without asking a single crown of us."
 corinite.204.t:0 "Wealthy Temples Sacked by Zealots"
 corinite.204.d:0 "Following Corin's will, we have built a peaceful and prosperous land. And yet, misguided rabble turn their clubs and torches upon our priests! Claiming that we've forgotten Her justice, iconoclastic maniacs have set one of our temples ablaze, brutalized our clergy, and smashed the statues and idols of our gods - both Corin, and the others of the Regent Court."
 corinite.204.a:0 "Savages! In the name of Corin, you tread in the footsteps of the Dookanson!"
 corinite.205.t:0 "Corruption within the Faith"
 corinite.205.d:0 "It is expected of our priests to go among the people, and to serve Corin's justice, spread Her mercy to the common folk, and spare them the pains of the world. It is concerning, then, that our Clergy are growing increasingly distant from the people, squabbling for rank, preening themselves with great honors even as they refuse to perform the good works for which they were named."
 corinite.205.a:0 "So? We've done Her work within our lands."
 corinite.205.b:0 "It's time to shake things up. Petty politics are for Adean's folk."
 corinite.206.t:0 "Community Around Faith"
 corinite.206.d:0 "As our country unifies around Corin's ways we have come to rely more on more on her temples as a bastion of Her will and our place as friends, family and community."
 corinite.206.a:0 "One Country, One Faith."
 corinite.207.t:0 "Donations to the Court"
 corinite.207.d:0 "We have wrapped the folk of our nation in Corin's gentle embrace, spared them the pain of poverty and the horrors of war. And for that, we've earned their gratitude and devotion. In return for this gratitude, the commonfolk have amassed a sizable fortune, and offered it as a gift. Should we simply place it in our treasury? Perhaps we could better carry out Corin's work by giving this to the poor."
 corinite.207.a:0 "Thank you!"
 corinite.207.b:0 "We shall use it as She would."
 corinite.208.t:0 "Cult of Personality"
 corinite.208.d:0 "Our ruler has truly come to embody Corin's will in the hearts of our people. No quarter has been given to the corrupt and decadent, to the cruel and abusive, and mercy is granted to those who are deserving. Though, they are not weak. Every stroke of the lash is measured and necessary. Every mouth is fed, every need is accounted for. With the unwavering boldness, the unabashed compassion shown by our ruler, whispers have begun to spread of their unusual connection to Corin's will. It would be hubris to suggest such a thing ourselves, but many of the common people have wondered if our ruler might be an avatar of Corin, and if nothing else, a true emulant of her ways."
 corinite.208.a:0 "A true paragon."
 corinite.209.t:0 "Defensive Dogma"
 corinite.209.d:0 "We cannot yield an inch, lest our people suffer at the hands of these decadent curs. Our generals and officers stand steafast at their posts, to ensure the safety of our homeland. Surely, we would be better focused in standing fast as Corin's shield for our people, even if we must take the blade ourselves, to spare our beloved."
 corinite.209.a:0 "Our shields protect..."
 corinite.210.t:0 "Offensive Dogma"
 corinite.210.d:0 "No quarter! These vile bastards stand in defiance of all that Corin has wrought, all that She would have us do to better the world. Strike hard, strike without mercy, that we might drive these wretches into Nerat's cold embrace, straight to the Hell that they well deserve."
 corinite.210.a:0 "Our swords strike true..."
 corinite.211.t:0 "Divine Inspiration"
 corinite.211.d:0 "A sword within a shield. That emblem of Corin is plain as day, recognizable to most any across Cannor, and, increasingly across Halann. But, what does it mean? It serves to remind us of our dual purposes. We must be an unflinching bulwark, defending the weak. And, moreover, we must be swift and sharp as the finest blade, in striking out against the injustices of the world, keep our hearts as cold as steel for those who would do evil, no matter what place of reverence they might have slunk into."

Along with their revelations they have made themselves indispensable to the masses, uplifting them and caring for them when nations across Cannor have failed, and bringing hope to a populace that an omnipotent and caring God does exist, and They are good: which is a far cry from the dynastic squabbles and flawed personalities and beliefs of the Regent Court and Corinite faith.\n\nAdherents of this new faith call for their cousins to follow this new religion, and follow the whims of God, not the whims of kings.

So far we have learned little, other than the claim that this shard is the original source of magic, and that it is the surviving essence of a precursor god, or according to Torrieth, the only god to have ever existed!\n\nWith the rise of the Ravelian Society and their specialization in matters of this sort, Torrieth has suggested that she take the God Fragment to Cannor in hopes that she, along with the brightest minds of the Ravelian Society, could decipher more from the God Fragment, and with our permission she would share their findings to us at a later date."

 ravelian.11.t:0 "The [Root.ravelian_councils] Ravelian Debate: [Root.ravelian_councils_desc]"

 ravelian.11.da:0 "The Regent Court believes that when you die, you get judged by Nerat, and depending on if you've lived according to your patron deity's ideals determines whether you go to Hell, serve penance in Nerat's armies against Hell, or live your life in blissful paradise in your respective deity's divine plane. While the nature of the Infernal Planes and Nerat's Fugue Plane has been confirmed by countless accounts of demons bound in summoning circles and Red Reapers sighted hunting down undead, it is the nature of the Celestial Planes that has eluded most of the modern world... until now.\n\nGreat research and forays into planar binding have allowed the Ravelian Church to contact and communicate with a great number of celestial beings and have discerned that they too are just as lost as we are. Their beliefs and lore are just as diverse and shrouded in mystery as ours, but one thing persists throughout: that the equivalent of their founder or creator is dead, and that their origin myths all contain an ancestral homeland that their race originated from.\n\nThis revelation, combined with new transcripts from the God Fragment and cross-referencing commonalities of myth in our world's cultures and religions have led to the conclusions that: Heaven exists, but its gates are closed and its location forgotten with the near-death of the One God. The dead do get judged in the Fugue Plane, but by (red-cloaked) angels of death, not Nerat, and that both the celestial and infernal gain power due to belief in their creators. Since the belief in a One God has faltered, so has the powers of the celestials, explaining their absence in the Prime Material Plane.\n\nIt is with this that the Ravelian Church now believes more than ever that revealing the truth of a One God to the world is paramount, and that by restoring faith in God will the gates of Heaven open and salvation can be achieved by all - both mortal and celestial.\n\nThe Ravelian Debate in question now lies: on how do we achieve salvation and empower God in the first place?\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nConversion is but the first step. The Regent Court mythos of emulating your patron's ideals is the truth. God is good and wants us to be good. We must perform Good Works for the church, ourselves and each other if we are truly empower God.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nIt is true belief and understanding alone that empowers God. Not only knowing, but truly understanding the Truth is what faith is made of, and as such we can only achieve true salvation through ruminating on the truths that have been revealed before us!"

 ravelian.11.db:0 "With the last Ravelian Debate securing the need to convert as many people to the faith to empower God and ensure salvation for all, the Second Ravelian Debate deals with internal matters of the church and how it should best achieve that:\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nHeresy and willful ignorance is rife across the world, and if they will not embrace the truth through debate and an open mind, then they must be saved through force. The Ravelian Inquistion will allow our faith to spread like wildfire and save the ignorant from themselves. Inquisitors will also ensure that those that do practice magic do so under the Church's approval, for magic is a gift from God and must not be squandered in dark arts and unholy works, lest they wish to join the heretics on the pyre.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nIf heathens and heretics refuse to hear our truth, then it the failure of the Church, not the fault of the unconvinced. False conversions will not help unlock Heaven. We must keep public and cordial discourse with them at all times, and open our minds to learn from their versions of the truth - and perhaps one day, we will reach new revelations together.!"

 ravelian.11.dc:0 "The idea the there is only One God is a strange one. Seldom do the faiths of the world deny the existence of all others gods, and even the Bulwari say that 'all gods are dead except ours', not 'all gods do not exist except ours'. Indeed, the all-encompassing and all-powerful nature of God has meant that we have found many commonalities in other gods to fold them into our idea of worshipping the One God. By looking at deity figures across Halann in a holistic way, the scholars of the church have determined that lesser "gods", like Surael, are in fact but facets, or aspects, of the One God. For God is Everything, and as such can wear many faces.\n\nAdditionally, research into the inner workings of divine figures throughout history like the avatar Corin has revealed that she, along with other prominent avatars, was imbued with otherwordly powers, and that if magic is indeed divine in origin, then she is but a powerful mage gifted with the ability to naturally wield magic, rather than control and tame it as wizards do. We have declared her and other extraordinary individuals that have no doubt been gifted divine providence (like Aldresia in her stopping of the White Pestilence) as the first Saints of the Ravelian Church.\n\nWith these revelations, the question has fallen on how to approach this topic in terms of converting the rest of the world.\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nMany cultures have heroic figures and scores of deities. We must use Sainthood as an open palm to welcome them to the fold with ease, even if that means relaxing our restrictions on canonizing new saints. Their heroes are our saints, for God truly works in mysterious ways, and if God did not give these figures of legend divine providence then surely they would not be granted success?\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nOpening our faith to accept anyone and everyone as saints, and god forbid, aspects, is a mockery of the Ravelian Society's original ambitions to unravel the truth of this world. We must scrutinize every saint, every aspect, every religion and every culture with a rational eye. We must not fear upsetting and destroying chances of converting the people if it means eroding the very core of what we believe!"

 ravelian.11.dd:0 "The Church has always held the belief that magic is divine. It is at the very foundation of Original Sin for the faith, as the precursor elves had been impatient and stole magic from God, instead of waiting for God to bestow magic upon them when the time was right as They did with dragons.\n\nFor a very long time, most scholars have disagreed with this idea that all magic is divine, but with recent advancements in researching the nature of magic and the God Fragment, the church has put forward a 'True Source of Magic Hypothesis'. The hypothesis is based upon the popular secular theory of 'Universal Magic' which claims that the old categorization of magic into areas like divine, arcane, bardic, and runic, is arbitrary, and was simply a way to explain 'how' magic was manipulated, rather than its true nature. The Ravelian hypothesis builds on this and combines it with existing scripture to provide enough evidence to make even the most hardcore secularist consider their beliefs: there is only one type of magic, but that type is divine, and that God is the true source of magic!\n\nWith these revelations, the church's attention has turned to the usage of artificery. For a long time, the church has believed that artificery was the great equalizer in righting the wrongs of the precursor elves, and allowed all, not just the few, to reap the benefits of magic. The two major factions of the church have proposed conflicting stances on the future of artificery in the Ravelian faith.\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nThe great advancements in artificery are not only a vessel to right the precursor elves' sins, but are in fact God's Decree that *now* is the time to spread Their divinity to all Their creations. While not all can harness or be gifted with magic, through artificery we could allow the divine gift of magic to be accessible to everyone and anyone, regardless of if they currently follow our beliefs. This should be done no matter the cost, and as soon as possible, to right the wrongs of the past.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nMagic should be shared, yes, but it is because of magic's divine yet mysterious nature that it should be shared with care and vigilance. Artificery itself is not only holy work but work that requires great time, patience and deliberation. The good works artificery can give to the world must be balanced with heavily scrutinized and sanctified methodology, and if that means withholding great advancements from everyday life to ensure it is done correctly, keeping God's gifts to the faithful only, or even witholding darker and forbidden methods and inventions from the masses for their own safety, then so be it."

 ravelian.400.d:0 "Ravelian Researchers have petitioned you for military help in a delicate matter of theirs: researching the nature of celestials. They do not trust adventurers to keep their word or to follow their orders directly, and as such have turned to us for support."
 ravelian.400.a:0 "Provide an escort."
 ravelian.400.b:0 "They can do it themselves."
 ravelian.401.t:0 "Ravelians Ruin Burial Grounds"
 ravelian.401.d:0 "A group of Ravelian scholars have been captured and put on the stockade in [cemetary_province.GetName] for ransacking a nearby burial ground. Your own officials confirm these accusations, and the entire place seems to have been upturned and various corpses desecrated!"
 ravelian.401.a:0 "They must have had their reasons?"
 ravelian.401.b:0 "Free the scholars."
 ravelian.402.t:0 "Ravelian Expedition Requests Funds"
 ravelian.402.d:0 "A group of Ravelian scholars, led by a prominent Rector, in addition to a handful of adventurers are petitioning us to help fund their endeavours abroad.\nThey claim to seek knowledge regarding the planes of existence, and other sorts of malarkey that has no relevance to a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ravelian.402.a:0 "Give them the funds."
 ravelian.402.b:0 "Send the Rector back to the Church."
 ravelian.402.c:0 "Send a few of our explorers with them!"
 ravelian.403.t:0 "Flagellants on the Streets"
 ravelian.403.d:0 "Hell is on the lips of the faithful in [Root.GetName].\n\nScores of Ravelians march down the streets, whipping themselves in repentance for their alleged sins. Leading them are priests, Rectors, claiming that only through public displays of the faith can one be truly freed of their sins, and only then can they ascend to Heaven."
 ravelian.403.a:0 "Let them believe what they believe."
 ravelian.403.b:0 "Break up these doomsayers!"
 ravelian.404.t:0 "Afterlife Debate Causes Panic"
 ravelian.404.d:0 "A much anticipated discussion on the nature of the afterlife, and what it truly means to go to Heaven or go to Hell has sparked fear across the nation.\nMany prominent Ravelians engaging in the debate have made their own contradictory and inflammatory comments, and the lack of agreement and clarity from even the most astute scholars of [Root.Country.GetName] has caused worry for the common man."
 ravelian.404.a:0 "The truth must always prevail!"
 ravelian.404.b:0 "Try to appease the masses."

 ravelian.500.t:0 "Forced Conversions"
 ravelian.500.d:0 "We have received reports that the province of [Root.GetName] has been forcibly converted to the Ravelian faith by an angry mob and an even angrier rector. Only a small number of people have died, and many have been dragged out onto the streets to profess the faith or be beaten by the mob."
 ravelian.500.a:0 "Finally they see the truth."
 ravelian.500.b:0 "Question these practices."
 ravelian.501.t:0 "$ESTATE_BURGHERS$ Paid to Convert"
 ravelian.501.d:0 "We have received word that several prominent members of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ estate have been bragging that the Ravelian Church has sent them a large amount of crowns to convert to the faith. While what is done is done, this blatant corruption has given one of our shrewdest advisors an idea: what if we confiscate their ill-gotten gains? After all, we should be converting out of faith and reason, not coin."
 ravelian.501.a:0 "Religion works in mysterious ways..."
 ravelian.501.b:0 "Confiscate their ill-gotten gains!"
 ravelian.502.t:0 "University Conversion Debates"
 ravelian.502.d:0 "It has come to our attention of a recent trend amongst our colleges and universities, where prominent members of RavelSoc (the local Ravelian University Society) have started inviting other students to debate the nature of religion and the existence of a One True God. Several members of the faculty have become worried, especially due to the fact that many students have debated and converted shortly thereafter."
 ravelian.502.a:0 "Good for them."
 ravelian.502.b:0 "Send a Rector to help the RavelSoc."
 ravelian.503.t:0 "Courtier Converts Prominent Mage!"
 ravelian.503.d:0 "Mages have always been a fickle lot, especially when it comes to religion, as they are often wont to believe that their arcane powers is a fine substitute for faith.\nOne such critic has been converted and has finally embraced the Truth, thanks to the persistent influence of our Ravelian courtiers. The mage in question has come to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for advice on how to best impact the Ravelian faith."
 ravelian.503.a:0 "Work with the church to influence the $ESTATE_MAGES$."
 ravelian.503.b:0 "Their keen mind will be a boon in finding new revelations."
 ravelian.504.t:0 "Ravelian Pogrom"
 ravelian.504.d:0 "The faithful have gathered in angry crowds and stormed prominent religious minority districts in [Root.GetName], killing many of its inhabitants and vandalizing many of its properties.\n\nThe crowd chants that due to a theory that 'Heaven will only be unlocked once all are converted to the faith', that killing the unfaithful means that more people are true believers overall - so surely that means that the faith is closer to achieving salvation?"
 ravelian.504.a:0 "Ignorant fools!"
 ravelian.504.b:0 "Makes sense to me."

 ravelian.600.t:0 "Should Avatar-Saints and God-Saints be Equal?"
 ravelian.600.d:0 "The Ravelian faith believes that most, if not all religions are simply aspects of a one true faith and a One True God. Sainthood was a way to recognize holy figures in the mythos of possible-converts, and to some, a clever way to extend an open hand of friendship to those that might be put off by the idea of a monotheistic religion that denies the existence of other faiths.\n\nA recent debate, however, has sparked between our own believers: is it right that avatars, divine reincarnation of the Regent Court gods, are held at the same rank and respect as what were fully-realised deities? An example of this was St. Auci Dameris, Queen of Dameria and St. Minara: Auci has been well-regarded as an avatar of The Dame (an accepted aspect of God) and canonized for her endeavours in bringing the elves to Cannor. Minara, however, has always been regarded as a lesser deity of the Regent Court.\n\nThe church's official stance is that all saints are the same, but the rectors have been arguing and debating this for months now!"
 ravelian.600.a:0 "We support the official stance."
 ravelian.600.b:0 "Perhaps there is more to this?"
 ravelian.601.t:0 ""Saint" in our Dynasty"
 ravelian.601.d:0 "A highly suspect but incredibly influential rector has mentioned to us the other day that they might have found "proof" that one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ancestors may have done enough holy works to be canonized as a saint.\n\n"Of course, this research is incredibly expensive. Extra... funding may be needed," they suggest."
 ravelian.601.a:0 "Oh, of course."
 ravelian.601.b:0 "We will wait for further revelations."
 ravelian.602.t:0 "Government Critic Canonized"
 ravelian.602.d:0 "A recently deceased but prominent critic of the [Root.GetAdjective] government has apparently been canonized by the High Rector!\n\nIn life they were an incredibly vocal voice against our endeavours, and now they are a saint, it might impact us badly if we let their criticisms fester."
 ravelian.602.a:0 "Saint words are holy words."
 ravelian.602.b:0 "Cover it up."
 ravelian.603.t:0 "Clash Between the Faithful"
 ravelian.603.d:0 "The topic of debate in the mouths of the Ravelian faithful have been the idea of Aspects and Saints, and which one is more important. Are all other gods Aspects? Or just some of them? Surely evil gods like Bulwar's Malevolent Dark cannot be an aspect of the One True God, who is all-good? Surely Agrados, who raped Halanna, cannot be a part of God?\n\nThe $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has been in a deadlock debating on this over and over and over again, and one of our shrewdest courtiers suggest that letting them distract themselves can allow us to increase our control over the estates."
 ravelian.603.a:0 "Try to mediate."
 ravelian.603.b:0 "Let them fight."
 ravelian.604.t:0 "Your God is Fake, Good Sir!"
 ravelian.604.d:0 "Glasses shattered, expletives thrown. On numerous occasions.\n\nOur diplomatic corps have become known as firebrands and agitators, espousing to foreign dignitaries from lands afar that their beliefs are false and that their gods are nonexistent.\nWhile this may be true on some cases, diplomacy requires tact and grace, not blunt accusations."
 ravelian.604.a:0 "But, your gods ARE fake!"
 ravelian.604.b:0 "Let the priests determine what is real or not."

 ravelian.700.t:0 "Artificer Giving Away Inventions?!"
 ravelian.700.d:0 "A rogue artificer has been seen standing outside his workshop giving away schematics, prototypes and incredibly expensive inventions to any passer-by. He claims that he has finally see the Truth and embraced God, and that God demands that magic be available for all - and for those who cannot practise magic: artificery is the next best thing!\n\nThe $ESTATE_ARTIFICERS$ are not impressed. This rogue artificer was one of their best, and he's giving away guild secrets!"
 ravelian.700.a:0 "Artificery belongs to all."
 ravelian.700.b:0 "Help the artificers shut him down."
 ravelian.701.t:0 "Ravelian Pogrom of Elves"
 ravelian.701.d:0 "The holy texts state that the precursor elves committed the Original Sin by binding and defeating God to steal their magic. This revelations has been on the mouths of many a fire and brimstone preacher for the past few months and now this rhetoric has taken an anti-elven turn. A mob of devout Ravelians have stormed elven neighbourhoods in [Root.GetName], slaughtering the innocent in the name of God.\n\nWhile the precursor elves did do this, the elven people living in [Root.GetName] were not responsible - hells, most elves don't even practice magic. Surely the sins of the father are not sins of the son?"
 ravelian.701.a:0 "The mob has a point..."
 ravelian.701.b:0 "Stop them!"
 ravelian.702.t:0 "Artificery Work Denounced by Church"
 ravelian.702.d:0 "The field of artifice is always pushing new boundaries, and it seems one of those boundaries has again been crossed.\nThe $ESTATE_CHURCH$ in our realm have denounced a recent invention by the $ESTATE_ARTIFICERS$ and are calling any who purchase or even speak of the device as hedonists and sinners."
 ravelian.702.a:0 "Support the Artificers."
 ravelian.702.b:0 "Support the Denouncement."
 ravelian.703.t:0 "Magical Cult Leader: Heretic?"
 ravelian.703.d:0 "All magic is said to have come from God one way or another, and as such magic is divine. For some this has been used to promote artificery for the benefit for the masses, but for others, especially those gifted with magic, it has allowed an aura of allure and gravitas that equals the Age of Witch-Kings.\nOne such individual has amassed a large following in [Root.GetName], calling themselves a 'Living Saint' and using their powers to, admittedly, do good works.\nA Rectorate Inquisitor has arrived in our domain, and advises that we act against this heretic, for this is a dangerous precedence to allow mages parade themselves as if they were gods."
 ravelian.703.a:0 "Send them something they won't expect..."
 ravelian.703.b:0 "If magic is divine, why not?"
