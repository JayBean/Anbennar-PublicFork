 # Discovery Events
 artifice_inventions.100.t:0 "Arithmatons"
 artifice_inventions.100.d:0 "Though mathematics - the simple act of using numbers - is something many will encounter over the course of their lives, some select professions make far greater use of it than others. An architect, for example, will be making extensive use of arithmetic to ensure his constructions do not collapse. This has been the greatest problem with grand constructions, that it takes a very long time to complete this math and verify it.\n\nThe Arithmatons present the solution to this particular problem - these peculiar automatons are shaped like humans, with workable hands and sufficient dexterity to utilize writing material. Additionally, they possess a significant calculating machine within their head, similar to a brain. When properly taught, an Arithmaton can be directed to review calculations and produce the correct result if the details of the problem have been made sufficiently clear."
 artifice_inventions.101.t:0 "Apparitional Communicator"
 artifice_inventions.101.d:0 "Although the T-wave transmitter works perfectly fine to project sound from one communicator to another, what happens when the user needs to project an image as well? Our Technomancer artificers have determined the answer to that question. If they must transmit an image, then they will be able to!\n\nThe apparitional communicator was created by applying Illusion magic to a T-wave transmission, allowing the new device to transmit an image of a small area around itself, with some small delay. Although these do not have a particularly great material benefit over their only-telepathic cousins, officially sponsoring this device would surely bring us fame like the arts of old."
 artifice_inventions.102.t:0 "Mystic Ciphers"
 artifice_inventions.102.d:0 "If it can be figured out by enemies, it is not a state secret. At least, that is the ideal situation; the fact of the matter is far bleaker. Critical information, be it in the form of information about our spies or in the form of critical state secrets, is frequently easy to crack into by the trained eye. The training these eyes require is constantly evolving, but it's a losing game - we cannot plug every hole before new ones spring up. In a perfect world, these secrets will only be visible to who they are specifically allowed to be seen by, and nobody else... but this is not a perfect world, or is it?\n\nBrand new cyphers invented by the Brillites use illusion magic that can only be cleared by incredibly specific code phrases, meaning that the documents we desire to be jumbled will stay as illegible messes to anyone who cannot speak the right phrase in the right way."
 artifice_inventions.103.t:0 "Viewcatcher"
 artifice_inventions.103.d:0 "The viewcatcher is one of the simplest, and yet greatest inventions of our time! Able to capture images for printing in a single instant, to be preserved forever is revolutionary, and its uses endless. From newspaper articles, to preservation of heroic deeds, to documentation of creatures unknown, to simply capturing dear memories, the viewcatcher is popular already with much of the general populace. Any rumours of its inner workings relying on miniature demons trapped inside painting the pictures are complete falsehoods, and should be dismissed."
 artifice_inventions.104.t:0 "Conversation Calibrator"
 artifice_inventions.104.d:0 "Gnomes have acquired a distasteful reputation as being "hard to understand," with other races pointing to our penchant for speaking quickly and using non-standard diction to explain why. Of course, we understand that these habits derive from a lifetime spent conversing with superior Gnomish intellects, but that won't persuade the other races. To address this, the Conversation Calibrator uses the power of illusion magic to create the appearance of speech that may be more comprehensible for their level of understanding, while allowing us to express ourselves without having to slow down to a mind-numbing pace. The pauses between sentences are worth the sacrifice."
 artifice_inventions.105.t:0 "Centipedal Chests"
 artifice_inventions.105.d:0 "The greatest issue with carrying around one's belongings is the weight. Some devices can ease the process, but 100 pounds of luggage is, ultimately, 100 pounds that needs to be carried. Many members of the higher echelons of society simply cannot attend social occasions fully prepared because they cannot carry everything they wish to bring along. If something was able to carry this effectively, then perhaps this issue might be resolved.\n\nThe centipedal chest is the answer to this problem. Named as much for its shape, the chest resembles a metal centipede, with multiple hollow segments. Luggage can be placed in these segments. The centipede, operating similarly to a Mechanim or a golem, is 'imprinted' upon an owner and will follow their commands.\n\nThis chest is able to carry large sums of weight without any physical labor (on the owner's part) involved. Puzzlingly enough, it seems defensive of its owner as well, and will often move to block any potential blow against its designated owner regardless of orders. This has created a most particular effect where they might be found on a battlefield with their owners, forming defensive walls when several are present or otherwise fighting alongside their bound master."
 artifice_inventions.106.t:0 "God Fragment Decoder"
 artifice_inventions.106.d:0 "God is one, and the world is one. The One God is all-knowing, all-powerful, all-present — but due to the precursors' betrayal, it is only embodied in a single point in all Halann: the God Fragment.\n\nThe shard's location is only known to the Veridicals and the High Rector, and only they have the honor and privilege of listening to the God's teachings. But that is only the start of the process: a series of high-pitched pure tones must be carefully recorded and transcribed, the resulting code can then be painstakingly translated to a language akin to precursor elven, and only then might the God's teachings become truly known. This process is laborious and difficult,  a challenge given the work's singular importance.\n\nBut no more. One of the God's recent messages included a kernel of a hint for improving the process, which immediately became the central focus of almost every artificer in the realm. We have finished it: a machine of precursor steel and seashell, with a damestear core, that can absorb the frequencies and immediately produce the language-equivalent. Though it still requires the High Rector's deciphering from the strange almost-precursor elven, the process has been sped up considerably. God is one, its word is One, and with this, that word shall be quickly known to every Ravelian in Halann."
 artifice_inventions.107.t:0 "Sunblotter Cream"
 artifice_inventions.107.d:0 "Although Vampires do not officially exist outside of tales meant to scare children to bed, the fact is that there is a thriving group of these mythological beings within our state. Though not all mythologies about their weaknesses are true, one has a very potent strength - if a vampire is exposed to direct sunlight, they will quickly burn to ash and be killed permanently. While attempts have been made to circumvent this, such as wearing thick full-body clothing or simply taking cover in wagons and palanquins, even a slither of skin can set off combustion and soon, death.\n\nTheir meddling in artificer innovation has produced the so-called Sunblotter Cream, a cream that when applied acts as an obstacle to natural light. Though the process to apply it all over the body fully can be very strenuous - often requiring outright submerging the body in a barrel of the substance - it can allow a vampire to walk in the sunlight as if it were night for many hours, in large enough quantities it can last an entire day, especially if combined with more traditional protections.\n\nAlthough this would seem a strange invention to those not already aware of the state's dark secret, it also has many commercial uses; any being who purchases cream and applies it can use it to offset pains caused by being exposed to sunlight for too long, as well as appearing to somewhat glisten around light."
 artifice_inventions.108.t:0 "Talking God Temples"
 artifice_inventions.108.d:0 "Our precursor gods left behind many relics that still bear an imprint of their lives, providing instructions and guidance to this day. Newer gods, who once walked this earth as kings, have also left behind the laws that organize society and the wisdom that organizes our lives. But with colonizers at our shores, we are finding some of the youth drawn away from these hallowed teachings, distracted by foreign lies.\n\nOur artificers have come up with a solution. By enhancing our temples with magitech, we can translate the psychic imprints and mummified remains into projections of real speech and real bodies, which awe the viewer by giving them a true sense of the Gods and their legacy. Any who visit such a temple is reminded of the truth of their teachings, and will follow them to their dying day."
 artifice_inventions.109.t:0 "Thinkquik Drink Mix"
 artifice_inventions.109.d:0 "The food you eat has an effect on your body and your mind. This second part is especially important - if the perfect diet is eaten, one can contribute to intellectual pursuits far more effectively than before. There are many issues to this perfect diet, however; one needs to know what to eat, have the ability to acquire it all, and actually be capable of finishing it all. This is to say nothing about making it appealing to do so.\n\nCooking is an art! Indeed, one could very well make the argument that an exceptional chef deserves a space in the Magisterium, so good is their ability to manipulate food. In this case, chefs have become artificers, for a time. Their assistance has allowed our Brillites to prepare an incredibly nutritious drink that is very appealing to consume. While they had prepared a nutritious supplement, a major obstacle in preparing it has been making it appealing to consume. Now, barrels of this ThinkQuik (as they call it) can be found in many taverns and inns across the country."
 artifice_inventions.110.t:0 "Wondrous Lunchbox"
 artifice_inventions.110.d:0 "It's not wrong to want to bring all the meals of the day with you, so that you can quickly get them out and get to eating when the time comes. Issue is, this isn't always possible. Keeping your food in a small container is a recipe for disaster, where the heat will either double-cook the food or spoil the whole dish! This is to say nothing of actually storing the thing; anything but the most robust foods can very well topple over on themselves, ruining a vital part of the dish - the structure!\n\nAs it turns out, it's very easy indeed to adapt bags of holding around these limitations. With the right magical enchantments, the bag of holding can become a lunchbox of holding! It is possible to isolate the contents of the bag entirely from the conditions of the outside world. Even more, the shape of what was put into the bag can be preserved as if it were sitting upon a tray or compartment. With this wonderful thing, it has become possible to make food at one time and eat it at another as if it were perfectly fresh!"

 artifice_inventions.200.t:0 "Brass Prosthesis"
 artifice_inventions.200.d:0 "Functioning based on clockwork mechanims, these brass prosthetics are one of the greatest medical innovations in recent history; through the might of artifice and mechanics, what magic has struggled with for so many centuries has finally been achieved; the replacement of lost limbs!\n\nBuilt of brass, these mechanical arms and legs graft onto the spot where a limb has been lost and, although not quite as responsive as the original limb, are still able to move relatively well, and are definitely much more durable. Thanks to this, many who have suffered non-fatal injuries that pushed them out of the workforce, forced to get by with crutches or a single hand, are now able to rejoin the workforce in an even somewhat improved capacity."
 artifice_inventions.201.t:0 "Artificer Exo Arms"
 artifice_inventions.201.d:0 "Through recent advances in potent dynamic servo technology, the ability to provide extra limbs is finally possible, without the need for committing crimes against nature. Advanced exo-arms are mechanical limbs, powered by clockwork, and controlled through a divination magic-based interface with the user's mind.\n\nThough not economical for general use, this innovation will allow our artificer units to become a much more potent force on the battlefield, able to carry more tools, tinker on the go, and wield much larger and heavier ordinance with even more inputs. After all, three hands are better than two!"
 artifice_inventions.202.t:0 "T-Wave Transceivers"
 artifice_inventions.202.d:0 "Communication and coordination over long distances has long been a struggle for a military campaign on even a relatively modest scale. Coordination between generals, commanders, and all those required to keep campaigns running smoothly, relied on horses and, in cross-continental campaigns, ships, and thus communication has been painfully slow. Until now.\n\nThrough the use of Telepathic Waves, the marvelous combination of clockwork and divination known as the T-Wave Transceiver has been born! This innovative system allows for one transmitter to broadcast telepathic messages to several receivers anywhere in the world, nearly instantaneously! With this new device, campaigns can now be coordinated to near perfect accuracy, and the troubles of outdated orders are now far behind us."
 artifice_inventions.203.t:0 "Mechanim Workforce"
 artifice_inventions.203.d:0 "With innovations having been gathered from the ancient mechanim of far-off Insyaa, we have been able to reproduce these mighty mechanical men of metal and damestear. Though our creations are not as advanced as those found in that far-off hellhole of a continent, our creations having only rudimentary intelligence at best, they are still some of the mightiest and most powerful labourers the world has yet seen. Able to lift heavy objects with ease, follow instructions to the letter, and work day and night without need for food, drink, or sleep, with a mechanim workforce, our economy will surely never be the same again."
 artifice_inventions.204.t:0 "Artificial Egg Surrogates"
 artifice_inventions.204.d:0 "Giving birth to an egg is hard. It is a painful, time-consuming process for the mother. Even though our anatomy is well adapted to the pressures of egg birth, it is not adapted for making the process comfortable. The harpy population would most likely be much greater were the simple act of childbirth easier to bear. With the advent of the Artificial Egg Surrogate, this fact may yet be rectified.\n\nThis device uses a mixture of magic and technology to create an artificial womb, which will grow an egg when fertilized by a capable male. The significance of this device cannot be understated - by avoiding the pains of childbirth, our population will be far more willing to raise young."
 artifice_inventions.205.t:0 "Automated Translator"
 artifice_inventions.205.d:0 "The Damesear has managed to establish itself as a melting pot of many of the species of Cannor (in no small part due to the city of Anbenncóst) and this unique situation has created unique problems. The city's coordination has been severely hampered by linguistic barriers - an elf might speak one thing, a dwarf another, a human a third - and these barriers have made it difficult to actually take advantage of the unique position this blending of cultures and races offers. However, with the invention of the automated translator, this might become a non-issue!\n\nThe Brillite artificers have created a device which can, using Transmutation magic, translate a phrase from any (included) language into its rough equivalent in another language included in the translator. Most impressive about the device is its ability to transmute grammar as well, meaning that very little time needs to be spent on translation when one merely needs to flick a handful of switches and speak clearly into the device."
 artifice_inventions.206.t:0 "Great Processors"
 artifice_inventions.206.d:0 "The world is full of many things worthy of being eaten. The art of preparing food has long been a source of pride among our people, and consuming yet untasted creatures is tantamount to a sacrament. As our influence and contact with the wider world grows, however, we have found far more unique food items than we have ever imagined. Couple this with the need for ever-larger and more lavish feasts, and it has become far too time consuming to discover how best to prepare individual ingredients.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, artificers have been contracted to create the 'Great Processor', a large metallic bowl containing magically-sharpened blades. These blades have been further imbued with the power to rotate at fantastic speeds, easily turning any ingredient into a fine paste that can be easily consumed. The biggest bone, the meatiest muscle, the stringiest sinew, all fall before it — such ingenuity in the art of the feast marks the modernization of our greatest traditions!"
 artifice_inventions.207.t:0 "Prehensile Tail Grafts"
 artifice_inventions.207.d:0 "The ancient dragons could lay waste with tooth, with claw, with fire — and with their tails, sweeping away buildings and armies with a stroke. We have mostly ignored this appendage, but with our artificers' new designs, a fifth limb is now truly feasible, making every task all the easier. With this latest innovation, the might of modern artifice brings us one step closer to the mighty dragons of yore!"
 artifice_inventions.208.t:0 "Soarwing Grafts"
 artifice_inventions.208.d:0 "Kobolds have always dreamed of flight, imitating their mythical ancestors the Dragons. Through the power of artificery, we can finally achieve this. Using a pair of magically strengthened fabric wings, imbued with large amounts of mostly reliably magic, the best that is achieved is only a limited form of flight, best used for descending upon enemies for the cliffs of their homeland. Refined version are capable of sustained flight, but these are much bulkier than the standard wings that only allow short bursts of power."

 artifice_inventions.300.t:0 "Balloonboost Packs"
 artifice_inventions.300.d:0 "As anyone who has been on a ledge will tell you, one can see so much more when they look at something from above. This poses an interesting question, however - can this be harnessed and artificially reproduced, this high-altitude observation? Through careful experimentation, it has been proven possible to replicate on our own terms. Our Brillites have come up with a device they lovingly refer to as the 'Balloonboost Pack', which accomplishes what the name might imply.\n\nA pack, placed on the artificer's back and secured with a harness, contains a balloon that might be unfolded and heated sufficiently such that it allows the wearer to float. It will slowly sink without constant heat, so it is not usable for anyone incapable of using Conjuration to produce the fire required to fly. By integrating this device within our forces, it will be possible to gain accurate, viewer-confirmed reports of enemy movements."
 artifice_inventions.301.t:0 "Sparkdrive Rifles"
 artifice_inventions.301.d:0 "The Sparkdrive is something of an icon. First invented by Gnomish artificers on the island of Nimscodd, the Sparkdrive uses damestear and lightning elemental essence to fire bolts of lightning similarly to a musket firing balls. These immediately caught the eye of any being interested in artificery or military technology due to their extreme range (the upper limits have not been determined, though they are certainly high) and pinpoint accuracy, both achievements which modern conventional firearms cannot match.\n\nThese firearms are, as one can expect, very difficult to acquire - any state that is capable of producing these rifles is very careful to not let the secret slip. In any case, our artificers have been able to piece together sufficient in order to create these magnificent weapons for our own state. Though there are not enough for mass use, specialized war artificer teams will be able to use them with confidence, until they can be further produced."
 artifice_inventions.302.t:0 "Mechanim Soldiers"
 artifice_inventions.302.d:0 "With innovations having been gathered from the ancient mechanim of far-off Insyaa, we have been able to reproduce these mighty mechanical men of metal and damestear. Though our creations are not as advanced as those found in that far-off hellhole of a continent, our creations having only rudimentary intelligence at best, that lack of intelligence is more than made up for by the fact that they are able to march for days on end, show tremendous raw strength on the battlefield, march and drill without complaint, shrug off bullets that would kill an organic soldier, and countless other boons. Warfare shall never be the same again!"
 artifice_inventions.303.t:0 "Believable Ruin-Two Bomb"
 artifice_inventions.303.d:0 "At the end of the day, might makes right. The strong will rule over the weak - and why wouldn't they? Anyone not sufficiently strong enough to preserve their independence will be stomped out by someone with the strength to conquer them. That's an issue for us Goblins, who are not exactly the strongest of the races. In order to truly secure our independence, it would require something to revolutionize the face of politics, something that no strength could best.\n\nThough the ability to create that is far out of our hands, that doesn't mean our enemies have to know that. To them, we have created something we deem the "Ruin 2.0" - an explosive able to recreate the Day of Ashen Skies as it was told to us. If we get attacked, or if someone gets on our bad side, we'll use it! They don't have to know it's nowhere near that powerful in reality.""
 artifice_inventions.304.t:0 "Ancestral Guardian Golems"
 artifice_inventions.304.d:0 "The idea of a living statue - a golem - is not a new conception, with the earliest example being those active in the days of ancient Aul-Dwarov. Our Brillites have dedicated the time and resources of their patronage towards replicating such wonders in the modern era. To this end, they have partially succeeded. The Brillites have succeeded in creating a functional golem, usually sculpted to resemble a deceased ancestor.\n\nMany dwarves who see these statues quickly deem them 'ancestor golems', in the belief that the spirits of the ancestors they depict would offer guidance to the golem and use it to protect their descendants. The idea of fighting alongside a deceased ancestor is enough to drive many dwarves to fight to the death, and even if death does not come it serves as a profound experience. Although they are too expensive to use as soldiers, these 'ancestor golems' could feasibly line the walls of any religious center. Imagine a goblin's shock when they attempt to defile a shrine, only to find the very objects they sought to destroy beheading them in a single swipe!"
 artifice_inventions.305.t:0 "Artifice Hunting Masks"
 artifice_inventions.305.d:0 "The elite who prove themselves on the wrestling-ground have always worn the masks they earn with pride and security, knowing they keep the Silent Watchers at bay. Foreigners might not know that even these lesser masks have an enchantment, much as the King Mask given to the greatest conveys the wisdom and power necessary to lead our people. But a lot of these enchantments are... not so very useful. The ability to see a cake in whatever colour the wearer desires, the ability to hear a specific jungle rat's movement from leagues away, an uncanny sense of smell for burning sugarcane only.\n\nBut no more. The artificers of our people, having learned and scavenged lessons from the Triarchy nearby, can now enhance these masks. Already, the material is well-suited to taking enchantments, which makes it easy to add far-sight lenses, Owls' Ears spells, and airholes that filter out any toxic gases. Any wrestlers who win such a mask will be granted such a suite of enchantments — alongside a mandatory place in our artificer regiments, of course, to fight off the colonizers who have come to our shores."
 artifice_inventions.306.t:0 "Avatar Supersoldier Serum"
 artifice_inventions.306.d:0 "Everyone knows about the avatars, individuals blessed with divine power for one reason or another. Everyone also knows they're the stuff of legends - there has not been one since Corin herself. The power of one of these avatars is vast, and their combat prowess is often unmatched. There has been a longstanding question of how this power could be properly utilized in warfare, for a state that could turn the powers of the gods to its side could triumph over anyone else.\n\nAfter some effort, our artificers have managed to harness that power - or something like it. By imbuing a liquid with incredibly potent Transmutation magic, and mixing damestear in, they have created a serum that quickly bolsters a (preferably willing) subject with almost divine strength. They are able to react faster, move faster, and possess extraordinary strength with which to use. The only issue with this serum is that it seems to 'burn out' the users, usually ending in a fatality after several weeks of power."
 artifice_inventions.307.t:0 "Codorran Powered Exosuit"
 artifice_inventions.307.d:0 "Gnomes are small, diminutive, and worst of all weak. No matter how strong the mind of a gnome might be, none of that matters when some larger individual decides that they are beyond reproach. This time, we can make sure that never happens again.\n\nEven better than a simple exoskeleton, this time the Brillites have earned the name! They have created a set of damestear-powered plate armor, capable of using magic to keep itself and its wearer intact even past the blow of a cannonball, capable of holding two palm-mounted spark-drive blasters, capable of boosting the wearer's strength to ten times what it was previous! It might be expensive, but who cares about the cost when it comes to benefits like this?"
 artifice_inventions.308.t:0 "Demonflame Flamethrowers"
 artifice_inventions.308.d:0 "Where the Xhazobine went, she burned. Gnolls have always been said to trace our roots to a mouth of fire, but she was the apotheosis of this: breaking open the Stone Palace of Ekluzagnu with a flame so hot it melted half a league worth of solid mountain, vaporizing those who stood in her way, and bringing a 'Decade of Flame' to Bulwar.\n\nFew have ever been able to match her demonic power. And we cannot claim that today, our artificers have. But they have achieved the next best thing: massive flame-spewing weapons, which take a half-dozen gnolls to man but can fling demonfire and immolate our foes. Castellos is dead, there is no Silver Dragon who might blow these flames back against us, and so soon all our Artificer Regiments will be able to emulate her power — and bring a corresponding dominance to the battlefield."
 artifice_inventions.309.t:0 "Dragonblood Gene Warriors"
 artifice_inventions.309.d:0 "Ours is the blood of dragons. Ours is the heritage of dragons. And ours is the destiny of dragons.\n\nThis is true for every kobold that lives on or in the earth, but few come as close to bringing that truth into reality as the artificer regiments consisting of Dragonblood-gene Warriors. A special treatment is performed on kobold eggs, a combination of arcane ritual with the injection of a small amount of a damestear-infused elixir. The kobolds who emerge grow at twice the normal rate, and have fully embraced that draconic heritage: they can muster short-range breath weapons, have scales as hard as armor, and can lay waste with tooth, claw, and tail alike. From before they are born, these Dragonblood Gene Warriors are marked for greatness, and a place in our armies' elite."
 artifice_inventions.310.t:0 "Dragonscale Plating"
 artifice_inventions.310.d:0 "Though most of our loyalty is to chromatic dragons, some individuals have always been intrigued by the metallic ones we hear rumours of. Would their scales be even harder than a normal dragon's, akin to a suit of armor by itself?\n\nOne artificer has taken this interest and turned it into obsession, which has now borne fruit. She abducted a few eggs, and dunked the new hatchlings again and again in a strange, dragon-and-damestear solution. Their scales turned hard — a clear proof of concept — and we should ensure many of the next generation experience the same process so they can serve as an elite vanguard in our army."
 artifice_inventions.311.t:0 "E++ Compound"
 artifice_inventions.311.d:0 "Ever put a fire to gunpowder? It explodes. At first, that was enough. In a way, it's still enough. However, over the years, the explosion gunpowder provides has become less and less gratifying. No longer is it some divine thunder, now it is just another flash-pop-gone curiosity. So what does it take to change that? More thunder!\n\nThe Brillites have created a new compound that, when mixed into gunpowder, makes it far more sensitive and far more violent when it explodes. It might be a little more risky, but what's that compared to the beauty of its earth shattering crack-rumble?"
 artifice_inventions.312.t:0 "Kaydhano-Powered Vessels"
 artifice_inventions.312.d:0 "The glass-workers of Arpedifér have long seen the Death Winds as more than a plague, taking opportunity in the sand they blow in to craft their ornate Potídhano, the Death Glass. One artificer born in that kheion, however, has found an even more promising opportunity in the Death Winds (albeit a much more risky one).\n\nLeaving the city during the storm, while dressed head to toe in protective gear layered with enchantments, she could harvest the sands while they still bore their deadly magic. When stored in a lead-lined box, the magic does not fade in the same way, and remains stored for later use. A box filled to the brim with the sand is thus an invaluable power source for any endeavour that requires long-term magical energy, and has already found a use in our warships to power the Kherkan sparkguns mounted on the latest Oktíkheioni designs."
 artifice_inventions.313.t:0 "Lullaby Cannon"
 artifice_inventions.313.d:0 "Our skalds have spent generation upon generation singing the songs required to keep Elkaesal the White from plunging the world into a new Era of Frost. But as we seek to maintain this noble duty, fools elsewhere look to us as ripe targets, ignoring the importance of our labour to any who live on Halann.\n\nOur most-trained skalds have practiced the magic in their song-poems for decades, and any mortal mind has no chance in resisting that which keeps a dragon herself at bay. Working with our artificers to magnify their voice without losing its magic, our new lullaby cannons project these saga-spells for leagues, putting our foes to sleep and making their defeat inevitable."
 artifice_inventions.314.t:0 "Power Fists"
 artifice_inventions.314.d:0 "There are many paths to a strong fist available to any follower of the Righteous Path. There is meditation in the High Temples, which can focus the soul towards channeling chi into fierce strikes. There is training from the Xia, ancient techniques that make a single hand into a weapon of mass destruction. And now, there are the artificers' latest invention: power fists, massive gauntlets forged from an alloy of steel and damestear and studded with jade, that grant the strength of dozens to the blows of one.\n\nThere are outcries from wandering sages and martial-arts masters, who think this an insult to their craft and heritage. But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has already placed an order for hundreds, and they will make our artificer regiments unstoppable (even if they may walk a little slower than usual, under the fists' impressive weight)."

 artifice_inventions.315.d:0 "For eternity, Surael has fought the eternal struggle against the forces of darkness, so that we might live in His light. Now today, He gives us another gift: the ability to channel His light in order to deal death and destruction in massive quantities. Though the intricate mirror arrays required to channel His energy are expensive, it is a paltry sum compared to the awe of chanelling all of His might into narrow beams that eradicate all in their path."
 artifice_inventions.316.t:0 "Warfare Simulator"
 artifice_inventions.316.d:0 "A bow, when drawn, must be loosed, lest it snap under the tension. So too must a nation and people organized around the army have battles to let loose in. And in those brief stretches of time between war, what others might think of as 'peace', shall in fact be occupied with preparation for war.\n\nIn an innovation of our subjugated artificers, they have used mind-altering enchantment spells to create a machine that a soldier can plug themselves into and have their mind transported into an authored dimension created to our military's specifications. This dimension or ""simulation"", can host thousands of soldiers at once and can simulate any battlefield scenario of our choosing without the need of physical space or logistical preparations. Our warriors will now be trained for any battle, any skirmish, any confrontation."
 artifice_inventions.317.t:0 "Arcane Blaster"
 artifice_inventions.317.d:0 "Almost every child, at some point, pretends to be a mage, imagining they had the power to merely point their fingers at something and blast it away. Alas, that is (almost) always merely a dream. But when those children grow up to be soldiers, with arcane blasters in their hands channeling magical power through a steel rig into a concentrated bolt, they can! Any magical overloads resulting in localised damestear explosions are purely coincidental."

 artifice_inventions.400.t:0 "Sending Stones"
 artifice_inventions.400.d:0 "Long-distance communication has typically required the use of couriers or flying animals, both of which are expensive to maintain and notoriously unreliable. Sending stones are a replacement created through artifice to facilitate the transmission of communications across long distances at instant speed, allowing our agents to coordinate with the capital much more effectively than before. Though only available to the most elite members of society, it is quickly catching on, and possession of a sending stone is already seen as a mark of social status."
 artifice_inventions.401.t:0 "Crierless Crier Device"
 artifice_inventions.401.d:0 "The ancient institution of the town crier has long been a crucial method for news, information, and official decrees to easily proliferate across the countryside. It's a great system, but it has some big problems — criers are difficult to organize and can distort information in the retelling.\n\nFortunately, through the power of artifice, we have become able to remove the living element of the system and replace it with large, portable machines capable of artificially recording and reproducing sounds. We're sure you'll agree the sudden unemployment of the criers is a small price to pay in the name of progress."
 artifice_inventions.402.t:0 "Living Mirrors"
 artifice_inventions.402.d:0 "Although the Apparitional Communicator allows for a picture to be communicated with sound, its limitations are severe - it can only support one-on-one communication (in terms of communicators) and requires transmissions to be 'live', hampering its potential to do much beyond one-on-one communication. As of today, however, our Technomancers have managed to evolve upon the T-Wave communicators once again, in order to create a product they deem a "living mirror".\n\nThrough a combination of evocation and illusion spells, the Living Mirror can receive broadcasts from one central location, which is capable of broadcasting to every Living Mirror on its frequency - in color! Even though it is just a rough design 'with much to refine', it has seen a meteoric rise in popularity. The lack of sound rules out many avenues, but text displayed on the Mirror is perfectly legible; there is already a bustling market for broadcasted plays and stage acts."
 artifice_inventions.403.t:0 "Fey Spray"
 artifice_inventions.403.d:0 "Although the Fey deserve our respect and admiration, being closely attuned to their realm has plenty of... drawbacks. They are fickle beings with very little regard for what their mischief causes to other beings. Responding to this with violence would be pointless; this is a part of who they are, as much as our attunement to them is part of us. Even so, some way to manipulate these encounters so that they may only occur on our terms would be welcome. We presented this problem to the Artificers: Keep the Fey away without hurting them.\n\nThey have delivered. The Technomancers have, from tireless testing, prepared a spray that acts as a repellent of sorts to the Fey. Anything this spray is applied to will be found as unappealing towards the Fey, and so they will tend to ignore it. This is not always effective, but it works as intended frequently enough to be functional."

 artifice_inventions.500.t:0 "Vendorless Stall"
 artifice_inventions.500.d:0 ""Although it might sound like a strange concept, consider a market stall that does not require a vendor to sell goods. One would simply insert coins, receive a desired product, then be on their way. No haggling, no delay, no required apprentices. At the end of the day, its keeper would refill the goods within it and collect the profits from their sales. The benefits are great -  merchants can sell their wares without needing to barter over its costs, craftsmen can sell their goods whilst doing the actual crafting at the same time, and the customers can make purchases quickly!\n\nThis concept has been the latest invention of the artificers, a machine that can be configured to sell all sorts of goods through various means. It might seem like this would have no tangible benefit for the state, but it does; the increased ease of doing business allows people to perform more in the same period of time, which itself aids our revenue by an impressive amount.""
 artifice_inventions.501.t:0 "Spell-in-a-box"
 artifice_inventions.501.d:0 "The commercialisation of magic has always been a strange topic; mages may be prone to selling their services, but those that do tend to charge high prices for anything more strenuous than a simple cantrip. However, through the power of modern technology, pre-cast spells can be preserved for long periods of time, contained within scrolls, themselves contained within specialised conteiners; the Spell-in-a-Box! Now, a single mage, specialised in a single spell, can imbue it into hundreds of scrolls at a time, for mass distribution. At long last, magic can be experienced by all, and at much lower prices; the middle-mage finally being cut out."
 artifice_inventions.502.t:0 "Chi Extraction Charms"
 artifice_inventions.502.d:0 "Chi. Life-force, the energy that flows through every living being — and many who are not. It is fundamental to all the Lefthand Path's practices, those benign, and those less so. But it is difficult to channel, and even more difficult to preserve, an issue for any who would harness its might.\n\nThe fools of the Righteous Path accept this constraint, and limit themselves to only the Chi they can create internally. The jiangshi of Jingqiu drain countless humans and still thirst for more, the Oni leverage ancient rituals — but with the newest invention from our artificers, any of our artificer regiments can have access to all the Chi necessary to power themselves in battle.\n\nA strange little box, seemingly a minor amulet to the untrained eye, contains an intricate array of steel and jade. Applied to prisoners or troops who 'volunteer', it drains their Chi like the jiangshi might, but rather than turning one into an undead creature it simply stores it for later use (albeit taking a few hours to do so). When released, it powers our artificer regiments to new levels of might. "
 artifice_inventions.503.t:0 "Weather Predicticator"
 artifice_inventions.503.d:0 "No matter the court, a simple fact of life is that the weather is ephemeral, shifting and changing in unpredictable ways. Though the weather can be shaped by the seasons, it is still hard to tell when the skies will allow for one activity or another. A ship could be sunk from a surprise rainstorm, or a Snecboth could be buried under a blizzard they had no hope of noticing. The ability to predict future weather, even if inaccurate, could be an unspeakably great boon to trade.\n\nBy utilizing our unique connection to the seasons, our artificers have been able to leverage a mixture of feymagic and divination to create a device that can predict the weather of the area around it, providing a user with (mostly) accurate readings of the temperature and things such as rain or snow. No longer will a ship need to worry about being caught unawares in a storm, or go without water because rains failed and they did not think to gather any from elsewhere."

 artifice_inventions.600.t:0 "Vorpal Bullets"
 artifice_inventions.600.d:0 "Typically, a firearm will make use of a ball, a roughly spherical metal object designed to kill whoever it pierces. Usually it works as intended, as armor does little to prevent one of these balls from punching through the wearer due to the high velocity of the shot. As time has proceeded onwards, shots being blocked by armor has become enough of a recurring incident that it cannot be denied. Ebonsteel, when prepared correctly, can sustain several shots before its structure is damaged. The creation of a shot that can effectively pierce this armor has become necessary. \n\nThe Vorpal Bullet seems poised to fix all of these issues. Featuring an experimental pointed shape, the Vorpal Bullet is able to focus all force behind its fire on a single pinpoint shot, creating an impact vastly more forceful than a regular ball. Additionally, its shape has a particular quality where it appears to move more quickly through the air, improving its odds of hitting on target."
 artifice_inventions.601.t:0 "War Golems"
 artifice_inventions.601.d:0 "The art of golemcrafting is a fine but laborous art, from the planetouched golems of Fangaula, the ancient guardians of dwarven holds to off-hand creations of errant mages, but with the advent of artificery as a practice, creating golems, no, a golem army, is suddenly very much a practical reality.\n\nWhile of rudimental intelligence and only capable of processing basic commands, they are, more importantly, capable of dealing a hefty punch! With sufficient damestear, these war golems can even charge enemy lines at a high speed and smash through them like a cannonball. Additionally, they will be able to draw fire away from our troops, acting as cover and even covering retreats."
 artifice_inventions.602.t:0 "Wandlocks"
 artifice_inventions.602.d:0 "Resembling matchlock pistols and rifles, these wandlocks replace the usual paper cartridge with miniature spell scrolls containing specialized variants of common battlefield spells. Popular spells include magic missiles, fireballs and lightning bolts, but on some occasions the wandlock has been loaded with protective spells, making for an incredibly odd sight when a gunmen shoots themselves point blank in order to apply it! Finally, through the power of artifice, magic is available to the common soldier!"
 artifice_inventions.603.t:0 "Personal Mageshields"
 artifice_inventions.603.d:0 "Some powerful mages reach for immortality, often going mad in the process. More clever ones settle for functional immortality, surrounding themselves in nigh-impenetrable mage-shields. Now that we have figured out how to stably project such fields via artificery; abjuration spells imbued into clockwork spell-gauges allow shield size and strength to be adjusted on a whim. Gone are the days of gaps in ones' armour, or even wearing armour at all!"
 artifice_inventions.604.t:0 "Antimagic Field Generator"
 artifice_inventions.604.d:0 "A battlemage can be worth many times his number in combat. Through increasingly destructive spells, one can conjure nearly anything, from fire to the undead. This can end up creating a superhuman through sheer pedigree, their blood allowing them to slaughter vast sums of 'lesser' men. If we could eliminate this magic, then it would be very possible to nullify the effects of magic in battle, so that all men could at the least die equally.\n\nThe Technomancers have created a device which resembles a lamp. When it is powered by Black Damestear, it projects a field not terribly unlike the light from a lamp which is capable of nullifying (or, as one moves further away from the device, dampening) the effects of magic within it. The device is stationary and requires too much time to set up to be viable in a military setting, but it is very helpful to make sure select points are immune to the uniquely destructive vandalism a mage can unleash."
 artifice_inventions.605.t:0 "Controlled Rage Serum"
 artifice_inventions.605.d:0 "In a fight, it's obvious an orc is at his best when he's mad. If you can get one sufficiently riled up, it will seem as if he's forgotten that he's mortal in his rage - surviving shot after shot, engaging in casual brutality and finishing it with a speed none could match - and it makes for an effective, if uncontrollable, fighting style. It would have been used more often in the past were it easier to control this rage. Even at the best of times, it's very hard to get an orc to reliably snap into a bloody rage. Letting him have his way with the enemy can do well to calm him down, but the process is slow and can leave the army unable to respond as quickly.\n\nThe Controlled Rage Serum brings the one thing an orc berserker needed: control. A soldier will start feeling the heat of their anger shortly after injection (with enough delay to direct them correctly), and the dosage can be modified to make sure that they calm down as soon as their fury isn't necessary."
 artifice_inventions.606.t:0 "Elemental Gunpowder"
 artifice_inventions.606.d:0 "Despite being the target of guns in aeons-past by the Skomdihric dwarves, we were in love at first sight with these glorious weapons. But that was years ago, and now we crave some novelty.\n\nIt is not enough for bullets to leave gaping holes in our foes, why do they not also light them on fire? Or freeze them solid? Or shock them? With this new elemental gunpowder, we shall renew our long-standing love, and see it reach new heights. Though storage has become remarkably more dangerous, the results speak for themselves; nothing makes a soldier more likely to retreat than seeing their compatriots go up in smoke from seemingly nowhere!"
 artifice_inventions.607.t:0 "Vernman Hero Tonic"
 artifice_inventions.607.d:0 "Every man and woman who can trace their line to the ancient kings of Verne shares two desires: to ride a wyvern and to become a hero. While this potion cannot grant you any scaled beastie, one swig and you should almost be able to see your name getting written down in the history books."
 artifice_inventions.608.t:0 "Veykoda Rune Protections"
 artifice_inventions.608.d:0 "The Veykodan have long used runes to fortify their armor and bodies against piercing spear, slashing sword, and even speeding bullet. In more recent times, the practice has also been emulated by the dwarves of Balgabar, runic tattoos enchanting their skin to similar properties. But the process of creating such runes was a laborious one, requiring a close attunement between the mage designing them and the warrior taking them on, along with the nigh-calligraphic inscribing of the designs themselves.\n\nOne technomancer, frustrated at their inability to find a mage who could create a set for their purpose (what do they mean, their artful craft aren't fit for an artificer smock and tunic?) has come up with a way to mass-manufucture the rune-writing instead of relying on bespoke artisanry. A mage can work to craft their designs onto a metal plate, which is then the centerpiece of a metal-stamping forge that also powers it with a slight infusion of Damestear. Any armor that passes underneath can be stamped with the runic designs, and the protections function almost as good as a more traditional approach. Finally, rune armor is available to all — and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has already put in a massive order for our artificer regiments to use."
 artifice_inventions.609.t:0 "Box Of Holding"
 artifice_inventions.609.d:0 "For centuries, the bag of holding has been a piece of equipment no adventurer can do without. How else would they hold all their loot? But now that our artificers have figured out how to expand its principles into larger and sturdier boxes, it will quickly become just as much a staple for merchants engaged in trade from Aelantir to Haless. For what's better than a bag of holding? A bag of holding that you can stack!"
 artifice_inventions.610.t:0 "Growth Beans"
 artifice_inventions.610.d:0 ""Farming equipment doesn't mean anything if the land itself is incompatible for your crops. Often, the greatest obstacle to farming is the land being used - soil conditions, as well as the weather, can spell doom for many crops if not carefully managed. Even if the food can grow, that's no guarantee that it will grow plentiful. An apple is hardly food if it is half the size of your hand!\n\nGrowth beans, named as such for the peculiar shape of their containers, are not actually beans. The container can be rubbed apart using one's hands, releasing a fine powder that strongly enhances the potential of crops when applied to farmland consistently.""
 artifice_inventions.611.t:0 "Magic Missile Deployer"
 artifice_inventions.611.d:0 "The first spell any mage studying evocation learns is the basic magic missile. It is their bread and butter, the bane of the darkness (in goblin, dire rat, or even orcish form).\n\nThese form of mobile artillery is somewhat clunky and complicated, but can spew unguided magic missiles in a form that can take out a dozen infantrymen in mere seconds. Our forces can no longer be charged and broken, any who dare would simply run into a storm of spellpower. With the firepower of more than a hundred novice mages combined into a single weapon, we have transformed a simple nigh-cantrip into a true weapon of war."
 artifice_inventions.612.t:0 "Naval Mageshields"
 artifice_inventions.612.d:0 "Recent advances in artillery have meant clashes at sea have become furious affairs, cannon- and mage-fire tearing through even the thickest wooden hulls. But our artificers have figured out a coating, imbued with abjuration magic, that allows a magical shield to be projected along any ship, from bow to stern. Unfortunately, the shields cannot be kept up permenantly, due to the need to fire in response, but by rapidly lowering, firing, and then raising shields, our defences can soon be impenetrable. Our warships should now be able to survive a full bombard from an enemy vessel — with nary a scratch to show for it."

 artifice_inventions.700.d:0 "Ever since the death of Alaria the Lifehand at the Battle of Trialmount, healing magic has lagged far behind other schools. But where magic has fallen short, artificery can go far beyond.\n\nThese kits contain unique potions, self-tightening tourniquets, and everything required to get a soldier off of Nerat's doorstep and back to the battlefield in scarce hours. All contained within a lighweight, portable package that barely weighs down a soldier on the battlefield, and able to be deployed with little to no training. At a moments notice, any soldier can just as easily become a medic!"
 artifice_inventions.701.t:0 "Sparkdrive Locomotives"
 artifice_inventions.701.d:0 "The tried-and-true pack animal has served us well since time immemorial. Until just recently, it seemed to be the perfection of its concept - train an animal to carry heavy loads and carry them quickly. Breed it until it can do that better than any individual ever could. As it turns out, doing the same thing but with metal and magic can create even better results.\n\nThe Mechanists have devised a cart that requires no specially bred animal to pilot it, requiring only damestear as fuel. It functions very similarly to the Sparkdrive rifle, using the damestear and elemental energy present as a source of power to move the cart. This creates a device that, even under extreme load, can transport goods and people from one place to another blindingly quickly, in some cases being able to make a trip over five times in the time it would take a traditional animal-drawn cart to make it once. It can only be used on specialized platforms due to this extreme speed, else it would catapult itself into terrain and be destroyed.\n\nWhile still in its early stages, it should be no surprise that this device will revolutionize transportation as we know it... perhaps in 1836?""
 artifice_inventions.702.t:0 "Burrower Arms"
 artifice_inventions.702.d:0 "Every self-respecting kobold harbors the desire to set up their own burrow and tunnels. The thing is, this is often much easier said than done. Soil conditions, as well as the effort required to move large amounts of dirt make it very difficult for a kobold to create a burrow worth his time.\n\nThe Mechanist artificers, however, have taken our patronage and made use of it to create a series of arm grafts and artificial modifications collectively known as the "burrower arms", capable of doubling, tripling, or even further beyond that improving a kobold's arm strength. With these, a mighty tunnel is readily in reach for any kobold who is able to take the procedures required."

 artifice_inventions.703.d:0 "The brilliant, mad, men who spend their lives trying to circle Wyvern's Gulf in as little time as possible found a fast friendship with the brilliant, mad, men who devote themselves to artificery. For generations, watercraft had been pushed to their limit, sacrificing safety and durability all in the pursuit of speed. This evolved into ornately-carved Catamarans hewn out of the finest wood from Bahar and Verkal Skomdihr, and a blazing record of seven hours, twenty minutes, thirty-nine seconds was set just three years ago by a Vernwoman said to be possessed by Corin herself.\n\nBut that was before, and we stand in a new world now. In the most recent Stingport Regatta, it is not the size of the sail that counts but that of the motor on the ships back, where nuggets of damestear propel craft to speeds never seen before, so that it the most a contestant can do to hold on and steer. Undoubtedly we will see many craft crash upon the rocky islands that litter the Wyvern's Tail, and already [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has drafted letters of condolences to any slain sailors' families. But this is what must be done, in the need for speed. And if we can harness even a fraction of their maneuverability and designs for use in our own ships, our navies will be unmatched in the Divenhal."

 artifice_inventions.704.d:0 "Scrapperclaws. The gnolls are traditionally scavengers and get much of their metal supply by breaking down old and unused metalworks or tearing up the metal products of those they raid. This normally takes them quite some time, pry bars to pull off sheets, metal saws to break things down.\n\nThese Scrapperclaws are worn like gloves with long exaggerated claws extending along the fingers and a frame running up the arm to the shoulder. The claws have small saw blades which vibrate back and forth to quickly saw through pieces of scrap and the frame around the arm will strengthen any gnoll that wears it, allowing them to carry more than normal. This has quickened the looting process significantly and has raised productivity in the scrapyards by a great deal. This has made gnolls very sought after by the owners of ironworks and scrapyards across Cannor and Bulwar as very effective labour forces in the pre-preproduction stages of metal fabrication."

 artifice_inventions.800.t:0 "Artifice Powered Magnate Factories"
 artifice_inventions.800.d:0 "It is a common sight to see factories in the lands of the Alenic peoples. These complexes are run by a social class named the Magnates, whose dedication to industry created the iconic sight of the sky being split into pieces by countless smokestacks. These factories have long been praised for their efficiency, where innovation and cutting-edge technology combine to make more goods at a higher quality than ever before. But what if it could be taken a step beyond?\n\nMechanists have devised a number of smaller inventions over the course of their study, mostly damestear powered. These can range from the water generator (which saves time by allowing water to be conjured on the spot) to the automated transporter (which uses damestear to 'push' objects along a specialized surface), all of which can greatly bolster a factory's productiveness by reducing the time required to produce goods and the cost required to produce said goods.\n\nOf course, the Magnates are focused on profit foremost. They are, for the most part, unwilling to move away from what they know works for inventions that seem untested. If we were to sponsor these inventions and ensure they do not cost the Magnates an undue sum, we would be surely rewarded in kind - both in funds and in goods."

 artifice_inventions.801.d:0 "Across our realm, mighty cities dot the lake-shores and beyond, towering above the mighty plains that we call home. Many of these cities contain beautiful works of architecture, mighty structures towering tall above our streets, serving as mighty symbols of Triunic strength and innovation. The only problem is that many of these structures were expensive to maintain when they were originally built, and with age, this problem has only worsened.\n\nLuckily, artifice has the solution! Tiny clockwork machines, designed specifically to look like native birds, shall be deployed in order to continually provide maintenance and repair to our cities in a cheap manner, without looking out of place in the beauty we have so carefully cultivated."

But our artificers have now turned it into a science, finding writing styles that most elude comprehension and the phrasing least digestable by the intelligent mind. From text that appears to morph and change shape under different light, to fonts which naturally cause the eye to pass over them, to the ability to type so small that entire clauses, and in fact entire contracts, can be written in the space of a single full stop!"

 artifice_inventions.803.d:0 "Of course gnomes are intelligent! Easily the greatest of the bunch! The issue is, brains can't do menial labor - by themselves, anyway. Many smaller tasks are difficult for gnomes, and can pose an inconvenience at best and an obstacle at worst to actual productive intellectual work. What the country needs is the brawn to the brain of a gnome, and slavery just doesn't do.\n\nThat precisely is where the Mechanim make their appearance! Based off a modified version of some schematics rumored to be from the mythical Insyaa, these creations resemble humans, though with skin painted a brilliant white and a pair of glowing dots instead of eyes. These contraptions are remarkably dextrous and are able to parse advanced commands. Although too fragile for military use, their ability to run at all times when powered by damestear makes them tireless workers.\n\nAny gnome unwilling to take care of more menial tasks can simply make use of a handyman unit, who will handle much of the busywork while the gnome focuses on far prouder intellectual pursuits. The benefits are obvious!"

If, by some means, these pearls could have a high quality guaranteed, they could generate a profit far higher than before; good pearls aren't cheap, after all!\n\nThe Mechanists have devised a creation allowing for several important things. It is a device that uses transmutation magic to mimic the conditions that create pearls in a fraction of the time. Though artificial, it can create perfect pearls (assuming the correct composition of components) in a matter of days. It can also be used away from the coast, allowing pearls to be prepared and created with a consistent quality, and, most importantly, be prepared all year instead of during a few scant months. If only it could prepare multiple at once..."

It has gotten to the point that it might take weeks, or even months, to ascend from a holds' depths up to its surface.

Now, through the power of artifice, and the might of steam and gas, the skies are open to all!\n\nMighty zeppelins dot the skies, floating testaments to the might of industry and the arcane. Capable of transporting untold numbers of people and goods vast distances quickly and cheaply, transporting explorers and adventurers to the farthest reaches of Halann, and bringing all the corners of the world within reach in mere weeks of travel, rather than months.\n\nThough not at all practical for combat purposes, able to easily be shot down by any mage or projectile, their use for the transport of supplies and reinforcements is nonetheless promising. Perhaps one day, wars will be fought entirely in the skies! For now, however, we must be content to simply revolutionize our economy, and leave the matters of skyships on the battlefield to the tinkers and dreamers of the future."

 artifice_inventions.809.d:0 "It's very possible to remove text from a piece of paper given the right circumstances, but those circumstances are specific enough that removing text is the exception to the rule. This can make mistakes and other basic clerical errors very costly to fix - if statistics are reported wrong, you cannot just quickly revise them and expect to keep a tidy and legible document! It takes an entirely new document just to make sure everything is correct.\n\nThe Mechanists have devised a unique type of document in order to ease these woes. It is a piece of not-quite paper. While it feels like the real deal, the texture of the material is such that it is possible to remove writing with a specialized brush (so as to make sure that text is not removed accidentally) and it will appear as if nothing was there at all!"

 artifice_inventions.810.d:0 "What is one of the greatest issues in Bulwar? Water. Water is life, when land is as dry as ours. Food may feed a man, but this food could never grow if it didn't receive an apt amount of water. This, as it happens, is the worst limiting factor towards the growth of our population. And though we are blessed by Surael with two great rivers, the further one moves away from a water source, the effort required to keep crops well irrigated grows exponentially.\n\nThe natural answer to this question is to make irrigation easier. If water can be sent further for the same effort, then far more land can host crops than ever before. This is easier said than done. But now, it has indeed been done! The Mechanists have devised a machine that can expel water at a velocity far higher than traditional sources, allowing it to reach much farther from the same place. Watering crops has never been so easy!"

 artifice_inventions.900.d:0 "Being able to shoot at your foe is all well and good, but what's the point if nothing hits them? If they were moving fast enough they could even dodge around every bomb launched at them! That obviously couldn't do, and a rocket that could chase down and kill whatever it was shot at was always a clear goal, even if the execution was less simple put into practice.\n\nNo matter that now, for the Mechanists have finally figured out how to make a rocket guaranteed to kill whatever it was aimed at. Through careful engineering they have devised an explosive guided by a combat Artificer, able to make wide turns and maintain its deadly power long after a regular bomb would have hit the ground and blown up.\n\nJust think of it - some fool dances around a bright red missile, and just as he thinks himself superior to goblinkind it curves right back around and the last thing he sees is a fearsome bright red chasing him down!"

 artifice_inventions.901.d:0 "We are strong. We have always been strong - towering above the smaller races, swiping aside their technology with the force of our blows even now - but 'strong' does not mean 'perfect'. Though it takes much fire, smaller weapons can still definitely bring down one of our kin, and their bayonets make it much harder to smash through their lines. If this trend had continued, the smaller ones might well have been able to break us upon their endless lines of fire and iron.\n\nBut they will not.\n\nBy powering a set of metal armor with damestear, it was possible to make it capable of so much more beyond being armor. This armor grants our soldiers an enhanced strength, allowing them to sweep aside lesser infantry with only a few broad swipes. The magic within it imbues them with protection, too, allowing them to charge the lesser infantry and break them without regard for bullets or even cannonfire. If this is not perfection, then the possibilities are limitless."

Too short to perform a lot of functions well, it would stand to reason that any naval power in Cannor could sink our fleets and despoil our lands if they so chose to. In order to keep this from happening, it's necessary to innovate on our ships. We'd need something that radically changes the face of naval warfare in order to ensure the legacy of the Hierarchy. Well, leave it to the gnomes to invent a radical innovation!\n\nThe G-U Boat (short for Gnomes-Underwater, obviously) is a special sort of ship that does not work through sail, or wind. It is powered by steam, using it to move great engines on the back of the ship that allow it to move around. Additionally, it is capable of submerging itself through careful enchantment and transmutation, serving as a waterproof vessel that can move around without the detection of surface ships!\n\nThough very expensive to create and maintain, these ships are virtually undetectable from the surface, making it much easier to prey on unsuspecting enemy vessels."

 artifice_inventions.903.d:0 "Recent advances in technology have created opportunities for machinery that even our grandfathers would not have even been able to dream of. Steam power has opened the way for a future where anything is possible given the right skill in engineering. Through our patronage the Mechanists have devised a machine with very interesting potential: a device they name the Gyrocopter.\n\nThe main designer behind the product traces his inspiration for the product when he once saw a harpy roost in a mountainous nest, where upon his return home he immediately set off to copy such a process. However, he did not create a winged flying machine. He created something better.\n\nThe Gyrocopter uses a combination of steam power and magical energy to power a rotor that spins at extreme speeds, allowing the operator to achieve flight, where they might direct the machine by leaning in one direction or another and tilting the vehicle. These machines can be used to fly at such an altitude that one might cross over the Serpentspine in one and stay alive. The military uses are countless - from dropping grenades on enemies, to scouting out positions with an ease not previously possible, even as far as some limited troop redeployment."
 artifice_inventions.904.t:0 "Kronium Battlesuit"
 artifice_inventions.904.d:0 "We dwarves have always been known as incredible fighters even in spite of our difference in height compared to our regular enemies. A Jork could be felled in two swipes of an axe the same as any other, but only the second swipe truly killed them - one to bring them to their knees, another to take the head off. The time wasted in having to swing twice concerned us as much as it concerned our ancestors, who started several experiments with height-increasing devices in order to give them the edge in combat. Even so, it appears the designs were abandoned for one reason or another as the Dwarovar met its final demise and fighting became more important than thinking. \n\nThough our artificers initially experimented with records of these old designs, especially one of a pair of mechanical legs, they quickly proved incompatible with the stationary, defense-oriented nature of dwarven tactics. To remedy this, they considered the opposite end of the spectrum; a set of extremely durable armor, perfected with the science of artificery. In this, they succeeded. The Kronium Battlesuit, as it is nicknamed (after the immovable strength of kronium itself) is extremely durable and holds a pair of extendable battleaxes, complimented by a set of slug shotguns that trigger upon a punch. Using these, a Dwarf can advance straight into the fray, charging into an enemy line with no regard for his own personal safety and slaughter the lot unscathed by shot or bayonet. Cavalry charges will hold no sway to him as well, for any attempted charge will simply topple over the dwarf as if they were a stone wall.\n\nThe tales of our ancestors are once more within reach, and we might now relive the days of dwarven heroes slaughtering whole armies!"

Through these mighty meldings of clockwork and steel, our muscles and claws can now be supplemented by the unconquerable might of machines, jumping enemy lines in a single bound, and ripping through even the strongest armour with barely a flick of a wrist. We can now revisit our oldest ways — and use them to bring ruin to any battlefield."

A piloted suit of scrap steel with a magically heated coal furnace to run the engine, only a goblin could’ve designed such a pile a junk and have it work so reliably.\n\nThis mech will allow a trained goblin to walk unhindered into battle, protected by the crude amalgamation of steel and other scavenged metal plates and wielding massive, interchangeable, hand attachments such as large saw blades, sharp claws, hammers, anything you can think of. The sheer momentum of one of these babies charging into the enemy lines, flames spewing out the front, smoke belching out the back, gleeful goblin cackling ringing from the top, will be enough to break any formation."

 artifice_inventions.907.d:0 ""In the Taychend, mobility is everything. What good is an army if it cannot move from one place to another, in good and efficient time? This is only amplified by the nature of the Taychend, where much of the terrain is flat plains where many unconventional military strategies can be applied. Chariots proved popular in the past, capable of moving quickly while still allowing for combat to be done if needed. As it happened, these chariots just simply are not fast enough anymore.\n\nHorses are mighty beings, but they have very mortal limitations. They, like all things, require rest and cannot move at their full speed for long periods of time without falling over dead. The next step is obvious - to create a horse that pays no heed to rest or feed, or better yet remove them from the equation entirely. This was accomplished successfully with the introduction of the steam engine, allowing for the creation of a machine that uses Damestear in tandem with an engine to produce power through heat.\n\nThis has led to the creation of horseless chariot and even large wagons capable of moving at extremely high speeds. Aside from that, these ""vehicles"" have another clear advantage: they can be customized far more than a horse-drawn chariot. Mounted spy-glasses, a broadside of firearms, a plow mounted at the front, armour coating on all sides, all of these and more are possible on these new vehicles.\n\nThe common soldiery have almost (figuratively) run over one another for a chance to use one of these vehicles to (literally) run over the enemy.

 artifice_inventions.908.d:0 "On the plains, a sandstorm could mean many things. Most importantly, however, it means to an interloping two-leg that they ought to run, lest the Centaur horde kicking it up catch them. It can also choke, the sand near-suffocating anyone without the sense to try and avoid it. These are both very well and good, but it also happens that they are natural events, not something that can be created. Until now.\n\nArtificery is hardly a warrior's role, but it has proven useful. This new device, named the Wind Invoker, is capable of conjuring a sandstorm when someone with magical talent uses it. The benefits are obvious - to those looking for sand or dust to herald the approach of the Centaurs, this can distract them and draw their attention away from the actual direction of attack. Even better, it can also suffocate the enemy within the sand, making any who cannot prepare for the sand of the plains easy targets."
 artifice_inventions.909.t:0 "Portable Turrets"
 artifice_inventions.909.d:0 "Defense can be a tricky affair. When charged sufficiently - such as, say, by an orcish horde - many soldiers can find it difficult to stay in place and defend as needed, even if such a thing will serve them better than simply running. Even when a soldier needs to defend offensively, in the case of a siege, a lack of due diligence can greatly lengthen the affair by allowing supplies to slip in to the defenders.\n\nPortable turrets have been introduced by the Mechanists to try and ease these issues. It consists of several guns contained within a metal frame, capable of rotating in a full circle. As the name suggests, these turrets are very easy to move - placed down in the shape of a box, and capable of unfolding to the correct shape. When guided by an artificer, these turrets can fight with the strength of several men with the presence of none."

Now, black damestear promises to change everything.\n\nBy infusing the bullets in the anti-magical mineral, they can pierce through the defences a mage may try and create. No more shall mages stand unstoppable in warfare. No more shall the common person be subject to the whims of magic. Down with the mages! Down with the old order!

 artifice_inventions.911.t:0 "Artillery Autoloader"
 artifice_inventions.911.d:0 "For centuries since their inception, the greatest limiting factor to the use of artillery has been the effort required to reload the cannons. Their true destructive power has been trapped behind the weight of the cannon balls (not a bad thing when shooting, but terrible when loading) and the long scrubbing process needed to ensure the cannon does not misfire.\n\nNot anymore! The Mechanist artificers have created a device powered through a mixture of steam and magic that automatically replaces the cannonball with only a fraction of the effort required on the part of the artillery team. Even though the cannon will still need to be scrubbed of any stray sparks, it will be much easier to do so when one does not need to expend their stamina on loading a large ball of iron as well."
 artifice_inventions.912.t:0 "Prototype Tanks"
 artifice_inventions.912.d:0 "The idea of cavalry is one that might well be as old as time. By riding on horseback, both rider and horse can become far stronger together than they were separately. This idea, the artificers have informed us, was where they began their engineering - create something that someone could ride that would accomplish its design better than a horse could. Even so, their latest major discovery is only vaguely related to their starting principle and even then was created by accident.\n\nThe magical energy within damestear can be redirected out of the material in many ways. An artificer made an accidental discovery - that being how to redirect the energy within as heat. This heat, when correctly directed, is capable of mimicking the conditions of a steam engine with a fraction of the size and effort. With this smaller size, it is plausible to use it as a power source for incredibly complex machinery.\n\nWith this small and very efficient power source, our artificers have collaborated to engineer a vehicle that, thanks to its power source, can afford to be much larger and heavier than most vehicles before.\n\nIt is, in effect, a large metal box - powered by damestear, it can move its great weight and even sport a cannon, which a designated gunner can operate and fire from a protected, freely-rotating position. Sparkdrives, repeaters and even normal cannons can also be fired from the top of the war machine, which has one mounted to it next to a hatch used to access the insides of the device. One can also stand with their body partially out of the machine to fire small arms at enemies when the main cannon is unable to fire. Thanks to its metal body, it can deflect much standard musket-fire, allowing it to operate less carefully than would otherwise be required."

 artifice_inventions.913.d:0 ""Though wars may be fought by land and sea, that does not mean those are the only places in which they may be fought. With the recent advances in technology, now even the sky itself might be home to the combat of the future. Being able to fly will grant us an unparalleled advantage over enemy forces - how does one outmaneuver an enemy who soars above them, let alone defend their holdings?\n\nThe primary complication for this idea has been, of course, weight. Though our artificers have been able to prepare many fantastical designs, very few of them moved beyond the planning phase due to the constraints of their weight; without careful budgeting of weight, it would be unable to get off the ground. Even magic can only partially solve this problem, for after a point the consumption of damestear grows so severe it simply is not worth considering.\n\nBy instead using damestear to amplify Evocation magic, the design - shaped like a ship-of-the-line - is able to replicate the effects of a hot-air balloon in an enclosed space, creating 'pockets' of air that allow the ship to float when mounted along the sides. These, combined with a series of steam-powered propellers and several large balloons which more closely resemble hot-air balloons, allow the ship to carry a sizable amount of weight without falling, and allowing it to lose several sources of lift without beginning to sink.\n\nThese ships, when manned, are able to carry a battery of cannons and the supplies required to fire them. The military applications are obvious - these flying cannons can rain down fire on an enemy while proving very difficult to fire back at."
