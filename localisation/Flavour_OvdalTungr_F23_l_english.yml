Depictions of better times decorate the halls, and our songs glorify the victories of our ancestors, for we have none to claim for ourselves. We were mighty once, debtors of Bulwar and an undeniable projection of power within Bahar. It took the most powerful empire in Bulwar to bring us down. Under the command of Jaher, our merchants and power were forcefully pushed out of our posts in surrounding lands and continents. Years later, the tribe of Mountainhugger - goblins from the Serpentspine, those ancient pests which helped destroy the old dwarves - shames us by the vice of their very existence. Memories of dwarven failure surround us.\n\nWe shall commemorate no longer. To start our reclamation, we will march with unabashed purpose in an invincible formation of cold dwarven steel, vetted by fury and confirmed with animosity. With blades to their wheezing, putrid throats, the goblins will not just be driven back, they shall be shattered utterly. Heads mounted on spikes will decorate the land to be mistaken as fields of wheat. Vast wealths of resources linger unspoiled and underappreciated, and will serve our greater purposes as we begin our just and true reexpansion into greater Bahar."

Yet, the 'Republic' of Re-Uyel soon proved to be a farce, ruled by human officers who were no better than aristocrats. The only good that has come of Re-Uyel was the merchant republic of [U17.GetName], whose independence we supported.\n\nBut now we must take a step further, and see Re-Uyel broken, as is only proper for a false republic led by officers whose chief concern is glory and spoils of war. Only ruling clans and long-bearded elders have the foresight to lead us into a prosperous future; only elected merchants, who have proven their merit through commerce, have the cleverness required to lead our human friends in Crathánor. Anything less than that is a disgrace, and must be swept aside.\n\nCarrion birds pick over the corpses of once 'free' elves and men in droves, while vengeful Crathánori footmen take their fair share of loot and pillaged goods. They have been with us from the beginning, admirably shouldering the same burdens we have, but without our lifespans, without our expertise. In the coming years, we will be in sore need of a reliable ally, and Crathánor would unquestionably rise to our defence if the world descended upon us. They are a fine people, and even the barnacle-encrusted Uthojdihr speak finely of the acceptable standards at which they hold their navy and merchants.

They called themselves the Uthojdihr, and persist to this day.\n\nAmbition dances in the eyes of their clans' young, and cinders of determination still burn in their elders. Smothered inside of a mountain until only recently, they are small in number, looked down upon by their peers. However, as our lands become more developed, and our borders more secure, resources continually flow in great quantities. Wood for spear shafts, bows, and planks. Cotton for clothing, interior furnishings, and sturdy sails. In council chambers, the Uthojdihr begin speaking up, fighting for any material that can be redirected their way. Ships slowly return to service, and the Uthojdihr spend many sleepless nights obsessing over trade maps from previous eras of greatness.

In particular, the occupied Bulwari city of Aqatbar allows for even lowly goblins to project a deceivingly large control over trade, both local and beyond.\n\nAqatbar, the keystone of the Gulf of Glass, is famous for being a font of glass production from master craftsmen. From potion-makers in Anbenncost to gnomish artificers in the Dragon Coast, the Gulf of Glass is irreplaceable and completely unique in its level of production. The goblins have allowed its kilns to go cold, but the world shall hear of their reignition, and traders shall soon travel once more from across the Divenhal to reach the mythical glassblowers of Aqatbar. The Uthojdihr have volunteered to lead this effort, and, in doing so, will engage in a trial by fire and sand. There will be innumerable foreign diplomats to create connections and meaningful relationships with, countless exchanges to be made in glass and goods, and dozens of incoming and outgoing ships to be monitored.

Our Uthojdihr operate in their courthouses and state buildings, observing the humans with great interest and quite boisterously supporting their ways of thinking. Over bottles of rum only men and women of the sea can stomach, long nights and evenings are spent affirming our beliefs and ideals.

Not only would this ease commerce across Bahar, but it would also allow the state bank to grant more equitable loans to their clients.\n\nAs more and more trade is conducted beyond our borders, putting forward an immutable, stable commerce will greatly increase the administration of our banks and our reputation for good business. Foreign powers desire a trading partner which is as firm and stable as well-casted iron in warring Bahar, and [Root.GetName] perfectly fits that description. At one point, entire nations desperately sought us out for loans and lines of credit. Our word is as powerful as our greatest flagship, and just as important in public perception.

The [U17.GetName]i and Copper fleets work in tandem to remove parasitic pirates from the Divenhal, and so, for generations to come, Bahar will be safe and prosperous under our steady hand. Of course, all of this is greatly improved by rows and rows of copper and metal coffers in dwarven and human banks.\n\nThis cooperation has brought us extensive influence all across Businor, whose hills are teeming with copper. With our expertise in the metal, we can send cadres of dwarves across the region, whether to simply settle and lend their aid as skilled craftsmen, or to seek out metal veins in hills and mountains to establish foundries and communities.

Commerce, trade, and the exchanges of ideas and people soared to heights that had never been seen before... but the Empire did not last. Times have changed, and without Jaher, the once-majestic Highway fell into decay and disrepair The Far Salahad, once thriving with merchant caravans plying their trade from Sarisung to Brasan, is now little more than a waterless land of sand when compared to its prime.\n\nBut hark! We have saved the businessmen of Bulwar! Our relentless drive to open a new sea lane between Bulwar and Haless has at last borne fruit: with the completion of the canal, merchants no longer need traverse treacherous southern Sarhali waters in search of Raheni or Halessi ports.

This met with initial success, and the sheathing of ships began in earnest... however, according to our sailors, it appears that due to strange interactions between the seawater, the copper plates, and the iron bolts attaching them to the hull, the plates are at serious risk of falling off mid-voyage!\n\nThankfully, dwarven ingenuity has won out once again! With the invention of something called 'Meadbrewer Metal', after its creator Grumni Meadbrewer, we can now plate ships' hulls with a coating that will resist decay and fouling more completely than we ever thought possible. Comprising an alloyed mixture of some sixty percent copper and forty percent zinc, as well as a trace quantity of iron, Meadbrewer metal has been found not to possess any of the deterioration problems that the previous copper and iron solutions possessed! Indeed, Grumni Meadbrewer has even put forward designs for bolts entirely composed of the metal, which are both stronger than the previous iron bolts, and also much more resistant to corrosion. Word has quickly spread of Meadbrewer's metal, and soon, he has begun to receive orders from all over the known world for ships to be sheathed in his magnificent new metal.\n\nMass-production of Meadbrewer metal has now commenced in full, and the amount of copper necessary to sheathe the hulls of merchant vessels worldwide has caused prices to rise once more, as demand begins to outstrip supply..."

Some are inconsequential to the running of the state, some far more important, but even those most critical of reports are nothing compared to those recently found under the city of Bulwar. It had only been an idle thought of a single dignitary to check through older records pertaining to the Copper Enclosure, but it seems now that his diligence found its just reward. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] reads the damning evidence, the stack of documents falls out of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands. \n\nThough the Copper Enclosure - the Phoenix Empire's 152-year blockade of [Root.GetName] - was started by Jaher himself, it turns out he was not the only party to blame for our suffering. Seeing their rivals of old brought low by the Phoenix Empire, Seghdihr convinced the Sun Elves to unjustly prolong the Enclosure in exchange for increasingly absurd trade concessions across the years. Though such things are long since past, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cannot help but feel rage fill [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart. Dirty, scheming, conniving traitors - the Citrine Dwarves are unworthy of the moniker 'dwarf'! To call them snakes would be an insult to vipers, for even the most deadly of snakebites pales before the venom of this betrayal.\n\nWhile it is true that [Root.GetName] and Seghdihr had oft been at each other's throats before Jaher's arrival, such underhanded duplicity goes beyond mere rivalry. This is not a grudge that can be forgiven lightly, nor one that we intend to forgive at all. We shall repay all 152 years of the Copper Enclosure unto Seghdihr in one blow, a master stroke to shatter the mountains themselves.

We have won this war, struck our fatal blow, and now the time has come to right the wrongs of the Citrine Hold. The grudge-debt of the Copper Enclosure must be repaid, and [Root.GetName] always collects its dues.\n\nThe first woe we experienced during the Copper Enclosure was humiliation. Just as Jaher severed our bonds of trade, we have severed Seghdihr's bonds of alliance with this victory; the first woe is already struck from the books.\n\nThe second woe we underwent was loss of wealth. With our network of loans illegally forgiven, we were left both cut off from trade and without anything to show for our investments. Even now, our soldiers dutifully carry the contents of Seghdihr's vaults out through the broken gates; the second woe has been repaid.\n\nLastly, and most cruelly, we were deceived. The scars of the Copper Enclosure run deep in the mind of our nation, every year that Seghdihr forced us to struggle through adding another layer to our grudge. This third and final woe has yet to be resolved, but that is a problem quickly righted. While Seghdihr may never be able to fully pay back the principle of honor which we are owed, we can at least collect any ounce of value remaining in the hold as collateral - with appropriate interest, of course."

They're a motley lot, assembled from adventurer elites and the veterans of our previous diving expeditions alike. The tang of salty sea air fills the underbelly of [Root.GetName] as their leader finishes delivering [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] speech.\n\n"You stand before the sea today as prospective heroes of our hold, warriors of the deep with your copper helmets held close under your arms. This is a strange battle you shall soon depart to, one where we fight with wisdom and wit, where our enemy is history itself. Do me proud, champions of [Root.GetName]. Do your hold and home proud, and reclaim the past from the Divenhal's darkest depths!"\n\nThe divers hold thise memory close as they prepare to dive, locking their helmets to their suits as they stand by the edge of their ship. It's not too far from shore, but time is always the most fickle of foes. Get too distracted by diving for the longest-lost treasures and you might forget your diving suit runs on a timer itself. Oxygen gauges primed, they dive under the waves, signing to each other with practiced efficiency as they descend towards the seafloor.

While we've continued to make improvements to both the diving suits and our expeditionary best practices, this is a test of skill the likes of which they have not yet attempted. Squads of explorers are split across five ships now, each diving one after the other before spreading out to cover as much area as possible. After the first group dives, their vessel signals the next in line to have their divers follow suit. In as short as a minute per team, all five groups of divers can be in the water and beginning to move out.\n\nToday must be exceptionally lucky for young Urist Wildhammer of the Uthojdihr, for after barely fifteen minutes he motions to his team, signalling that he's found something. It's a copper coin, heavily corroded by its time underwater, but one side is still barely legible. It reads '1330' in stamped Bulwari text, far too long ago for copper of this quality to retain that much detail in constant exposure to seawater. Urist points excitedly at the seafloor nearby, picking up another piece of copper, this one worn down to an irregular half-circle of metal. The team spreads out again, and after a short search the source of the coins is revealed. Spars of wood jut out from the seafloor, bits of smashed crate and the occasional coin scattered throughout the sunken ship's skeleton. A half-buried chest rests against the vessel's shattered bow, its scattered contents no doubt the remainder of a long-dead merchant's lost profits."

Their leader, an elderly but genial dwarf named Brann Bronzebeard, walks the line of his command as they steel themselves for the dive to come.\n\n”Now lads, not to put any pressure on you lot, but I've gone and made a little wager with Wildhammer - that uppity beardling thinks he can beat me to the next big find!” he guffaws, patting the front of his diving suit as he speaks, 'Thing is, I don't make bets lightly, and I'm damned if I'm giving him a whole keg of my best vintage. Let's get down there, find some great big chest of gold, and show that youngster what for, eh?'\n\nThe rest of the team match Brann's smile, throwing mock salutes to their leader as he seals his helmet in place.\n\n'Oh, and one more thing.

Brann leads his team in, panning his head from side to side as to compensate for his helmet's restrictive field of view. Eventually, one dwarf spots a metal fragment buried in the chunks of shattered stone, nearly invisible under the remains of an altar. Gloved hands work together to unearth it, and the divers pull out what appears to be a bronze discus of some sort. Brann inspects it, turning the disc this way and that under a few ways of faint sunlight.\n\nThe relic is a small shield of polished bronze, its surface marked by three raised ridges in a series of concentric rings. Strangest of all, it's in flawless condition. The metal has a sort of dull yet persistent sheen, reflecting the distant sunlight even this deep underwater. The divers glance at each other nervously, unable to read the expressions of their comrades through their bulky helmets, yet arriving at the same conclusion simultaneously.\n\nBrann grabs ahold of the rope, heaving himself back aboard the ship they'd left only an hour earlier. He rips off his helmet with a gasp, glad to be breathing fresh - if admittedly quite fishy - sea air once more. He turns to his team, the shield grasped tightly under one arm, and waits for them to finish removing their helmets.\n\n'Not that I'm upset about winning me bet, understand, but when I thought about finding lost relics of the God-kings... I never could have predicted a shield that keeps itself magically greased.'\n\nHis face remains resolutely neutral as the slippery shield slowly slides from his grip, falling to the deck with a dissonant clang."

Both of their diving teams had been sent down to investigate this location after a fishing boat reported pulling up strange pieces of wood and metal in its nets, and they'd searched around for days before finally finding the source of the debris. The aged veteran and the eager youngster enjoyed working together, but they'd yet to find anything truly worthwhile while diving alongside each other. At least, not until now.\n\nUrist turns to his companion, signing to him in the diver slang that had developed over the past few years of their work. He makes the signs for 'big' and 'find', but also the two-handed gate representing [Root.GetName]. Brann raises an eyebrow in response, then catches himself as he realizes Urist can't possibly see his face clearly through the thick glass of their helmets. He makes his own signs, fumbling slightly with the new communication method he'd been slow to adopt, and points emphatically to the symbol wrought into the side of the ship's hull. On the flank of the sunken battleship, the Copper Gate stands resolute.\n\nTheir return to the ship is not accompanied with the usual fanfare and celebration that surround new discoveries. What they've uncovered today is more than just a relic of the past - it's a fragment of our own hold's missing history. This is not one of our warships, lost to some forgotten conflict, but a vessel belonging to the original [Root.GetName], the hold that fell over seven thousand years ago. The exact details of the ancient hold's demise are not yet revealed to us, but judging by the gaping wounds still visible in the sunken ship's hull, they didn't go down without a fight."

Even the most thalassophobic dwarves among our ranks say they felt comfortable aboard the Uthojbrog, likening the feeling of standing on the Great Dredger to that of having their feet on solid ground. \n\nGiven our ever-growing overseas empire and a slowly growing divide between the Uthojdihr and the Copper Dwarf majority remaining in the hold, we have decided to embark on a mission that puts even the Dredging to shame. We shall use the power of steam to forge a navy fueled by coal and clad in iron, we shall harness our naval expertise to craft steamships that calm the hearts of our more ocean-averse kin, and through them we shall rule the waves through mercantile and naval might alike. Yet compared to our greatest goal, these are but mere trifles. The Great Dredger was an excellent proof of concept, but dwarfkind is nothing if not stubbornly ambitious.

 flavour_ovdal_tungr.47.d:0 "For many years, a gargantuan steel hull, the size of which dwarfed even Remnant Fleet ships, has been attended to by a legion of workers, architects, nautical engineers, and Uthojdihr. This work only intensified after the sea gates of the hold were opened, and the hull floated out - barely - into a special bay within [Root.GetName]'s external harbor, as the ship had grown too large and ponderous to remain within the hold proper and still permit normal access to the interior.\n\nThe empty hull (which had necessitated the building of an entire new wing of the port) was a statement of dwarven engineering in and of itself, but still the shipyard continues to work at top speed. Scores of dwarves toil in overtime shifts to build huge segments of towering superstructure. As soon as anything is built, a seemingly-endless number of railcars stream forth from the hold to the site of construction, where the dockers install each and every item. Four massive triple-expansion Strongbellow steam engines, the power generation of which had never even been thought of even in Grun Strongbellow's wildest dreams. Four equally-massive bronze screw propellers that had taken more bronze than even the largest furnaces were capable of manufacturing in singular pieces. Coal bunkers that could threaten to empty whole mines of their output, and the colossal boilers they fed, eagerly devouring coal to power the Strongbellow engines. Dozens upon dozens of breech-loading cannons, plus their powder and runic shot.\n\nThe list grows longer and longer, and the ship's structure grows higher and wider. Funnels, crew decks, kitchens, recreation chambers, and more continue to be added. A civilization is built in metal, one valve at a time. Slowly, piece by piece, the ship takes shape, and its purpose becomes clear for all to see, even those simply passing by the hold en route to other ports in Bahar..."

The order from on high is clear and concise: two words that sent an anticipatory shiver down the spine of any who hear it. 'Begin preparations.'\n\nThe next day, thousands of soldiers, sailors, and other crew, both military and domestic, board the massive vessel.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the sounds of machinery working can be heard for miles around, day and night, as the crew works the ship up to a ready status. The colossal furnaces, large enough to swallow a dragon each and still have plenty of room, are stoked and fuelled with coal. Teams of stokers, trimmers, and shovellers work around the clock to supply the fires with enough fuel to make steam. The propeller shafts are spun in place to ensure a tight fit. Countless vats of lubricating grease and oils are liberally applied to the engine machinery to avoid damage from any gears or shafts running dry. Any leaks or structural cracks are found and plugged, and extra runic reinforcements installed to ensure integrity. Casemate guns are loaded and fired with blank charges to test their integrity and chamber pressures. On the main command deck of the Sea Hold, the bridge crew familiarizes themselves with the various systems and monitoring devices crafted so that nothing would be missed. Pressure gauges are calibrated, and voice tubes checked for clarity. Nothing could - or would - go wrong, on this most famous day in Copper Dwarf history.\n\nSoon, it would be time to put it all to the test.

He chuckled to himself; it might have been a ship, but here, sitting on the bridge, he could have easily been fooled to think he was back on land. Lighting his pipe, Captain Longbeard glanced at his helmsman, before barking an order with gruff seriousness.\n\n'Helm, engines ahead slow. Revolutions zero three zero.'\n\nThe helmsman nodded, relaying the order into a voice tube to his left, before cranking the engine order telegraph to the 'Ahead Slow' position. Deep within the bowels of the Sea Hold, the engine bell shrieked its harsh cry over the deafening roar of the engines coming to full power, as dozens of engineers and crewmen rushed to their stations and prepared to release power to the shafts. Above the ship, four gaping funnels belched plumes of thick black smoke into the skies, and a cacophonous rumble echoed all along the coastline. Many in [Root.GetName] likened the noise to that of an earthquake: indeed some tired sleepers had been awoken, and had rushed out into the streets in fear of such a reality.\n\nFour juddering jolts shook through the ship. The propellers had begun to turn. The Sea Hold, Ovdal Uthoj, the pinnacle of dwarven nautical engineering and the largest ship Halann had possibly ever seen, shuddered and groaned as slowly... ever so slowly... it eased into the harbor proper. A thunderous wave of cheering and celebration erupted from the onlooking masses as they watched the Sea Hold's gargantuan bulk begin to move under its own power.\n\nThey had done it.

Hopefully, some innovative inventor will one day create something that will allow us to clear the flooded depths. For now, however, we should turn out attention outward, rather than downward."
