 # Missions
 F23_petty_king_protection_title:0 "Petty King Protection"
 F23_petty_king_protection_desc:0 "No realm around us survived the Decades of Devastation unscathed, but were one to measure misery suffered during that time, the Petty Kingdom of Ourdia would rank highly. Though Bal Ouord still stands, the ancient citadel is largely left in ruins, and the Petty Kingdom found itself surrounded by no less than three goblin tribes.\n\nWhile we have eradicated the Mountainhugger Tribe, Ourdia still faces multiple threats, and might well be amenable to accepting an offer of vassalization to ensure their survival, especially if such an offer is accompanied by enough resources to restore Bal Ouord."
 F23_petty_king_protection_tt:0 "If we fulfill the first condition, Ourdia can become our vassal in exchange for 150 ducats."

 F23_refugee_resettling_title:0 "Refugee Resettling"
 F23_refugee_resettling_desc:0 "While our Hold never suffered any serious threats during the Decades of Devastation, our share of said Devastation was felt in the gold mines of Gulangor, where goblins slaughtered or drove away our people. Now that the province is once more in our grasp, we must ensure that it is properly defended and patrolled, so that we can evict the remaining goblin squatters and allow our people to return to their homes."

 F23_securing_our_heartlands_title:0 "Securing our Heartlands"
 F23_securing_our_heartlands_desc:0 "During our millennia-long history, our borders had largely been static. Only the Uthojdihr found themselves frequently leaving the Hold, and even then, they did so to trade rather than to conquer. The last few decades have shown us that this isolationism is not enough to guarantee the safety of the Tûngr mountains. No, we must ensure that there is a line of defense between our heartlands and any would-be invaders!"

 F23_the_bahari_standard_title:0 "The Bahari Standard"
 F23_the_bahari_standard_desc:0 "With all of Bahar in friendly hands, it has been proposed that the weight and purities of coins should be standardized. Not only would this ease commerce across Bahar, but it would also allow the crown to better lend and borrow. All that is required for this plan is to ensure that we produce enough gold to meet demand for this new currency."

 F23_the_mountain_smothers_title:0 "The Mountain Smothers"
 F23_the_mountain_smothers_desc:0 "Goblins.\n\nDestructive, miserable beings. Our ancestors fought them, long ago, but until as recently as half a century ago, we thought that they were a pest confined to the Serpentspine.\n\nThe Decades of Devastation taught us otherwise, and we must now deal with the goblins, as our forefathers tried to. Show the Mountainhuggers our fury! They have hugged the mountains of this region, and will now find themselves smothered between the Tûngr Mountains and the Serpentreach!"

 F23_butting_heads_title:0 "Butting Heads"
 F23_butting_heads_desc:0 "We first had to deal with Mountainhuggers, but they are not the only goblin clan, or even the largest. No, the most powerful of these is the Marblehead Clan. If we wish to know peace and prosperity once more, we must march against the Marbleheads, and ensure that they can never again threaten us!"
 F23_butting_heads_tt:0 "If Baharkand is out vassal, they will gain permanent claims on these areas instead."

 F23_a_better_bahar_title:0 "A Better Bahar"
 F23_a_better_bahar_desc:0 "Since the Decades of Devastation, Bahar has not known true peace. The goblins were not the only threat to peace in the region - Re-Uyel's repression of the Ilatani also prevented true peace - so driving the Mountainhugger and the Marblehead Clan from Bahar will not be enough to secure peace.\n\nNo, if we wish for the people of Bahar to prosper, to be able to walk from one end to another without needing to fear for their lives, we must ensure that the entire region be under the control of either us or our allies."
 F23_a_better_bahar_tt:0 "If Crathanor is our subject, we will get the option to integrate other potential Bahari vassals and Ourdia into them, so long as these vassals are not players."
 
 F23_baharkand_outreach_title:0 "Baharkand Outreach"
 F23_baharkand_outreach_desc:0 "If not for the leadership of Irran Mallahtum, the goblin invaders might well have overrun western Baharkand completely. However, Irran managed to rally the Baharkand armies, and managed to maintain a slice of the Kingdom of Baharkand.\n\nMany had expected him to crown himself King, but duty - or simply his advanced age - saw him swear fealty to the Kingdom of Azka-Evran, the nominal successor to the Kingdom of Baharkand. However, while Irram remained loyal to that regime, his successor might be swayed to become our subject, if we can convince them that we are a better bet at driving back the goblins."

 F23_looking_beyond_bahar_title:0 "Looking Beyond Bahar"
 F23_looking_beyond_bahar_desc:0 "The past few decades has forced our focus away from the seas, but with Bahar secure, our attention can once again turn to maritime matters. Pirates from Nathalaire and Drokaland plague our trading lanes, and they have grown rich from plunder.\n\nIf we are to put an end to them, we must first prepare our navy to deal with this scourge of the seas. The first step will be to built up infrastructure to expand our navy, while the second will be to recruit human rowers to man our galleys."
 F23_looking_beyond_bahar_tt:0 "The modifier will last 20 years, extended by 10 years for each vassal obtained through missions."

 flavour_ovdal_tungr.docking_failure.d:0 "Due to scripting limitations, Sea Hold docking will not work properly if you have any Flagships other than the Sea Hold, nor will it work if you simply place a random galley in a province.\n\nIf you tried to game the Sea Hold system, whether by using a regular galley or even a captured flagship galley, shame on you.\n\nIf not, apologies for the inconvenience. If the Sea Hold was deleted, you can respawn it once you have deleted all flagships and galleys."
