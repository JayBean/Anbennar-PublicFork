 F23_the_mountain_smothers_desc:0 "Goblins.\n\nDestructive, miserable beings. Our ancestors fought them, long ago, but until as recently as half a century ago, we thought that they were a pest confined to the Serpentspine.\n\nThe Decades of Devastation taught us otherwise, and we must now deal with the goblins, as our forefathers tried to. Show the Mountainhuggers our fury! They have hugged the mountains of this region, and will now find themselves smothered between the Tûngr Mountains and the Serpentreach!"

 F23_the_rival_republic_desc:0 "With the so-called 'Republic' of Re-Uyel crushed, Western Bahar has been made much safer. However, with war over, the spoils of war should be appropriately divided.\n\nAfter all, Crathanor did not fight this war alone, so even if they might have been granted the land in the peace treaty, it is only appropriate to bring up a more equitable division of the spoils, with Ovdal Tûngr being granted the city of Re-Uyel itself."

 F23_securing_our_heartlands_desc:0 "During our millennia-long history, the only significant changes to our borders happened during the Days of the Ashen Skies, as some of the land we controlled disappeared beneath the waves. Only the Uthojdihr found themselves frequently leaving the Hold, and even then, they did so to trade rather than to conquer.\n\nHowever, the last few decades have shown us that this isolationism is not enough to guarantee the safety of the Tûngr mountains. No, we must ensure that there is a strong line of defence between our heartlands and any would-be invaders!"

 F23_butting_heads_desc:0 "We first had to deal with Mountainhuggers, but they are not the only goblin clan - or even the largest. No, the most powerful of the invaders are the Marbleheads. If we wish to know peace and prosperity once more, we must march against them, seize the province of Aqatbar, and ensure that they can never again threaten us!"

 F23_a_better_bahar_desc:0 "Since the Decades of Devastation, Bahar has not known true peace. The goblins were not the only threat to peace in the region - Re-Uyel's repression of the Ilatani also prevented true peace - so driving the Mountainhugger and the Marblehead Clan from Bahar will not be enough to secure peace.\n\nNo, if we wish for the people of Bahar to prosper, to be able to walk from one end to another without needing to fear for their lives, we must see the entire region controlled by us or our allies and expel any invader goblins who might linger!"

 F23_the_bahari_standard_desc:0 "With all of Bahar in friendly hands, the Uthojdihr are insisting that local currencies be replaced by a so-called Bahari Standard. Not only would this ease commerce across Bahar, but it would also allow the state to better lend and borrow.\n\nOf course, we would need a steady and secure supply of gold to back up this new currency, so our local gold mines must be expanded."
 F23_the_bahari_standard_tt:0 "The owner of [538.GetName] also gets '§YThe Bahari Standard§!' unless they are subject to anyone but §YOvdal Tûngr§!, in which case their overlord of the owner will get it instead."

 F23_our_ilatani_allies_desc:0 "Our allies in Crathanor - or rather, Istrahures! - have stood by our side, and we by theirs. So now that they have secured their ancient homeland, we must help ensure that it never falls again.\n\nTo this end, several cadres of Dwarves will be sent to Businor, whether to simply settle and lend their aid as skilled craftsmen, or seek out metal veins in hills and mountains to establish foundaries and communities."
 F23_our_ilatani_allies_tt:0 "Every Businori province controlled by Istrahures which produces copper or iron will gain a small dwarven minority, and gain the §YCopper Presence§! modifier.

While they are thought mad by most Copper Dwarves, it is undeniable that they bring vast riches and resources to our realm. With more and more of Bahar falling under our sway, they have requested assistance in expanding their trade facililities, to gain further riches."

The straits between Eborthil and Akasik, on the other hand? Thanks to the pirates of Viakkoc, they are usually avoided by most - but not all - merchants, with some captains gambling on sailing south of Eborthil, eluding toll fees at the risk of running into pirates.\n\nIf we seize control of the strait and set up regular patrols to deter pirates, we can enforce tolls on this strait as well, further cementing our control over the entrance to the Divenhal - though the profitability of this toll will suffer while pirates linger."

Every centre of trade worth its name is crawling with Uthojdihr merchants, while our fleet ensures that merchants can safely ferry their goods to and fro.\n\nWhat was once a dream among the Uthojdihr has become reality, and their ambitions have seen our coffers filled to the brim. We rule the Divenhal, and where the ruling clans and common dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr alike once looked down on dwarven sailors, they are now held in high esteem, with the Uthojdihr Clan being considered just as dignified as any other major clan."

However, it has never before been in dwarven hands, and thus there is room for improvement.\n\nThe Isle of New Tefkona can be harnessed, with the local fishing industries providing more capacity for our navy and as a source of sailors. Even better, controlling the Isle will allow us to not just expand our minting program, but also accelerate the prevalence of our coins throughout the Divenhal, by mandating that tolls for passing by the Isle be paid in our currency."

While the grain produced there is by no means inexhaustible, its sheer fertility cannot be rivalled anywhere else, and being able to source almost all of our grain in Koroshesh would greatly simplify the logistics of ensuring that our trading posts are adequately fed.\n\nAs such, we should seek to gain access to this granary, whether by force and diplomacy, and ensure that it can meet our demand."

However, while we are well aware of the northern parts of the continent, its southern parts is largely a mystery to us, and we do not know the truth from tall tales.\n\nThe Uthojdihr are eager to rectify this, as it is the next logical place for us to extend our trade network to. To do so, we should send not only emissaries, but also a significant fleet which will allow us to project power in the Sarhali Seas."

 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_desc:0 "To say that Sarhal is of interest to our merchants would be an understatement. Vast lands containing a multitude of people to trade and bargain with is a boon to any trader worth their salt.\n\nOf special interest are the cloves of Fahvanosy, whose ability to make even the dourest of meals at least somewhat palatable with just a few pinches of powder makes it desirable for the common people, while the wealthy and powerful seek to acquire it in even greater quantities.\n\nTo truly break into this market, we should secure its central hub: the bustling Sweetport in Teramzadai."

Before the Golden Highway was built, the trek through the Salahad Desert was a treacherous one, and even after Jaher bound Bulwar and Haless more tightly together, our focus was on maritime trade in Divenhal, rather than sending caravans across the Salahad Desert.\n\nThanks to our trade outposts across southern Sarhal, however, our merchants can make the journey to Haless without venturing across the scorching sands, but can instead use our trading posts to go south of Sarhal.\n\nHowever, the region of Ardimya proves a significant obstacle to journey all the way to Haless, greatly increasing shipping costs for those who do not simply sell their goods to local middlemen.

As such, the Society presents a ruinously expensive proposal, the expense of which brings a stunned silence to the Lord-Mayor's council.\n\nIf given more time, the Strongbellow Society will likely be able to come up with a less exorbitantly expensive solution, but they warn that even if given a hundred years, there will never be a cheap way of doing this, as the dredging will require the creation of a ship the size of a small island, which is not only extremely expensive in terms of materials but will also require specialized facilities.\n\nSuch a task, however, will have to be done without Grun Strongbellow, for the aging inventor has little passion for endlessly iterating upon an already functional solution."
