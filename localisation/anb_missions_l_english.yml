 Z50_forced_marriages_desc:0 "The Reachmen Lords, though having decades ago submitted to orcish rule, still harbor some degree of rebelliousness, and some may still have loyalty to the old human domain of Bal Vroren. In order to ensure their continued loyalty, both today and for generations to come, we will present these human lords with orcish consorts. Not only will this ensure their loyalty in the short-term, as they will be unlikely to wish to go against their spouses, in the long-term as well, half-orcs are far more likely to be loyal to our new kingdom than humans.\n\nRefusing these marriages will not be an option."
 Z50_trade_priviliges_for_cedevik_title:0 "Trade Privileges for Cedevik"
 Z50_trade_priviliges_for_cedevik_desc:0 "During Brasur's conquest of Vrorenmarch, the lord of Cedevik was one of many who refused to submit to the new Grey King, but after months under siege, the powerful merchants of Cedevik, of sounder mind than their foolish liege, realized the inevitability of Brasur's conquest and opened the city’s gates. Brasur rewarded them by executing the lord and instead establishing a mercantile republic. Loyal to the Gray King of course.\n\nIt is time, now, to remind them of the many benefits of our rule. By selling some of our trading rights to them, we will obtain some much-needed coin, and ensure their loyalty in the years to come."
 Z50_subjugate_goblins_title:0 "Subjugate Goblins"
 Z50_subjugate_goblins_desc:0 "During the Greentide, a goblin tribe known as the Hideguzzlers crossed the borders of our new kingdom, establishing themselves atop the great mountain of Gulletpeak. A constant thorn in our side since their arrival, we must bring Gulletpeak under our control, not only to establish a strategic defensive position against the southern adventurers, but to show once and for all that the strength of the Gray King is not to be underestimated."
 Z50_religious_syncretism_title:0 "Dookan Syncretism"
 Z50_religious_syncretism_desc:0 "We are not interested in spreading the faith of Dookan amongst our human subjects. After all, only the strongest are worthy to follow in Dookan’s wake. Rather, it is simply far easier for all involved to allow the humans to continue to worship the gods of their ancestors. After all, the weak seem to feel some sort of need to believe in something, and who are we to deny them some form of solace?\n\nThe humans must be reminded, however, that though their faiths are tolerated within our lands, Dookan still reigns supreme over all of divinity."
 Z50_rebuild_garok_title:0 "Rebuild Garok"
 Z50_rebuild_garok_desc:0 "Esald, or Garok in Orcish, is one of the oldest and biggest cities of the Alenic Reach. In fact, due to its central location, it may well serve as a potential new capital for the Gray Kings. But if Garok is to serve a new capital of Grombar it will require a mightier population, and the infrastructure to support it. As such, we will entice orcs from the surrounding lands to move to the city. Combined with construction efforts to revitalise the old infrastructure, we shall turn Garok into a cultural and economic centre, built in collaboration between both orcs and humans."
 Z50_rebuild_bastan_duskur_title:0 "Rebuild Bastan-Duskur"
 Z50_rebuild_bastan_duskur_desc:0 "Bastan-Duskur, known to the Reachmen as Cedevik, has long served as the economic heart of our kingdom, a center of trade and commerce to rival any other in the Giant’s Grave. However, the city’s buildings are old, and its population is still dominated by humanity. Like we have done in Garok, we will encourage orcish migration to the city, as well as investing vast amounts in revitalising the city’s infrastructure, to create a city that is not just the equal of all others in the Giant’s Grave, but the greatest city in the sea, envy to all others!"
 Z50_repopulate_alenic_reach_cities_title:0 "Repopulate the Reach"
 Z50_repopulate_alenic_reach_cities_desc:0 "Over centuries of war and conflict, the cities of the Reach have seen a great decline. Across the southern coast of the Giant’s Grave, entire districts of cities stand empty, with there being simply not enough humans to populate them. We will rectify this situation; a wave of orcish and half-orcish settlers shall be sent westwards, in order to join the Reachmen in the building of our cities to ever-greater heights."
 Z50_repopulation_of_gerudian_cities_title:0 "Repopulation of Gerudian Cities"
 Z50_repopulation_of_gerudian_cities_desc:0 "Both Redgarhavn and Konungrhavn, greatest of the Gerudian cities, strongly resisted our conquest, and as such have been greatly damaged during the many wars against the realms of the far north. Our settlers will repopulate these cities and develop them into great centers of Grombar like their sister cities to the south. After all, what better fate could befall these lands than serving as the beginning of yet more integration of humanity into the realm of the orcs?"
 Z50_create_iron_company_title:0 "Create Iron Company"
 Z50_create_iron_company_desc:0 "As a part of our initiative to ensure the superiority of orckind over the north, we shall establish an elite armed force, consisting only of the mightiest warriors across all of Grombar. Soon enough, all of Cannor shall learn to fear the mere mention of the Iron Company. And fear them they should, for all who do not, do not live that long afterwards."
 Z50_resettlement_of_white_reachmen_title:0 "Resettlement of White Reachmen"
 Z50_resettlement_of_white_reachmen_desc:0 "The White Reachmen, so long subject to rightful orcish rule, still hold far too much influence in the vital economic hubs of the Alenic reach, and humans have even begun agitating for independence from the mighty kingdom of Grombar. In addition, our colonies in the Northern pass have lagged behind in population, with many orcs not wanting to leave for the much harsher, frozen lands of the east. It seems, however, that these two problems may in fact solve themselves…"
 Z50_resettlement_of_blue_reachmen_title:0 "Resettlement of Blue Reachmen"
 Z50_resettlement_of_blue_reachmen_desc:0 "With the staggering success of the resettlement of their eastern cousins in the far east, it only stands to reason that the same concept would surely work in the west. By forcibly vacating the Blue Reachmen from their cities, in favour of settlement in the Northern Pass, we will make room for yet more orcish settlers in our lands further west."
 Z50_break_diplomatic_isolation_title:0 "Break Diplomatic Isolation"
 Z50_break_diplomatic_isolation_desc:0 "Orcs are strong, but we need not be strong alone. To the west, many nations could potentially become new allies of our growing kingdom. The elves of Celmaldor promise great opportunities in the form of trade across the north. The gnomes of the Dragon Coast could well prove perfect allies, with their brains added to our brawn. Finally, the rose-kings of Lorent, though not sharing much in common with us, do bear a similar desire to see the destruction of Gawed.\n\nWhoever we choose, it seems  Grombar will be able to march on into tomorrow with allies by our side."
 Z50_greenmarch_title:0 "Greenmarch"
 Z50_greenmarch_desc:0 "The orcs of the Greentide were misled by Dookanson, fighting a pointless war of annihilation that was always going to end in disaster. That need not be the end of their story, however. The green orcs are still orcs, after all, and the prospect of an orcish march to guard ourselves against the rising Escanni kingdoms is certainly a tempting proposition."
 Z50_first_orcish_kingdom_title:0 "First Orcish Kingdom"
 Z50_first_orcish_kingdom_desc:0 "Brasur Frozenmaw began his conquest of the kingdom of Vrorenmarch in 1420, capturing the previous royal family and subjugating the local lords in a campaign that lasted nearly five years. The memories of his campaigns and the strength of his clans still remain, maintaining a sense of fear within the local human lords, but it is unclear if this sense of fear will continue to keep the humans in line once the first Gray King has passed. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to demonstrate the strength and stability of our new kingdom. We will not fall to the same fate as Dookanson!"
 Z50_unite_gray_orcs_title:0 "Unite Gray Orcs"
 Z50_unite_gray_orcs_desc:0 "Though a vast majority of the orcs of the Graytide pledge their loyalty to the Gray King, many have instead chosen to remain in the lakelands of the Giant’s Tears, most notably the traitor-clan of Broken Jaw. If our domain is to survive the years that are to come, then we must ensure the loyalty of all Gray Orc clans. Divided, we fall, but united, we conquer."
 Z50_king_of_orcs_and_humans_title:0 "King of Orcs and Humans"
 Z50_king_of_orcs_and_humans_desc:0 "With the passing of Brasur, the first Gray King, Frozenmaw now finds itself at a crossroads. Our lands now serve as home to both orcs and humans, and the place of humans in our new kingdom has already become a subject of great debate.\n\nAlthough none argue for the expulsion of the humans, two camps seem to have emerged. The first talks of the inherent supremacy of orc-kind over humanity, and thus advocates for a state of orcish and half-orcish rule over human subjects. The second, however, advocates for a policy of tolerance, treating the humans of our realm, if not as equals, then as partners. Our monarch is now faced with a choice that will define Frozenmaw, and by extension all of gray orcdom, for centuries to come."
 Z50_strengthen_royal_power_title:0 "Strengthen Royal Power"
 Z50_strengthen_royal_power_desc:0 "To our west, though subservient, the human dukes and merchants have long enjoyed a great degree of autonomy in their affairs. This cannot last, for any amount of autonomy they retain may well lead to a sense of independence, and perhaps even rebellion, in the years to come. Rather, the realm of the Gray King must be centralised into a single state, and the human nobles must be brought into line, by force if necessary."
 Z50_brand_new_kingdom_title:0 "Brand New Kingdom"
 Z50_brand_new_kingdom_desc:0 "No longer a scattering of tribes, sitting as conquerors over the kingdom of old, we have truly turned our realm into a kingdom in its own right. We are surely not Bal Vroren, but so too are we no longer the realm of Frozenmaw. We have become something greater, something more. A kingdom where orc and human alike are able to live together in peace, not just surviving, but thriving. Grombar."
 Z50_move_capital_to_garok_title:0 "Move Capital to Garok"
 Z50_move_capital_to_garok_desc:0 "The city of Garok, greatest of the cities upon the Bay of Chills, is a vital strategic and economic center in the Alenic Reach. As well as this, it serves as a much more central point for our administration, being at the core of many of our main population centers. As such, the city seems to be an obvious location for the Gray King to hold court in. After all, a new kingdom needs a new capital, one which can serve as a center for our realm in the years that are to come."
 Z50_fall_of_bayvic_title:0 "Fall of Bayvic"
 Z50_fall_of_bayvic_desc:0 "Bayvic, largest of the cities of the north, has long been a thorn in our side. At every turn, they seek to destroy our nation, in order to reinforce their own hegemony over the Giant’s Grave. Moreso, the city serves as a point of unity for the humans of the Alenic Reach, and may perhaps one day form a united front in order to destroy the mighty kingdom we have worked so hard to build. Bayvic must fall."
 Z50_finish_conquest_of_free_cities_title:0 "Finish Conquest of the Reach"
 Z50_finish_conquest_of_free_cities_desc:0 "The trade leagues of the Blue Reachmen are fragile and unstable. The cities compete and fight among each other constantly, in petty squabbles that seem to be without end. With the fall of Bayvic, not only divided, they now stand leaderless. Thus, all of the reach will be brought under the rule of Grombar, in order to bring the undue trade and prosperity of the Alenic Reach to all of the northlands."
 Z50_fortify_gawedi_border_title:0 "Fortify Gawedi Border"
 Z50_fortify_gawedi_border_desc:0 "To our south lies Gawed, the realm of the mighty eagle, lord of the Alen. Perhaps, this kingdom may serve as our first true rival in these lands. As such, they deserve the respect of proper preparation for warfare. We shall build a series of fortifications along our border, in order to ensure that the coming conflict between our realms occurs on the soil of Gawed, and not Grombar."
 Z50_conquer_great_marches_title:0 "Conquer the Greatmarches"
 Z50_conquer_great_marches_desc:0 "Between Gawed and Grombar lie the Greatmarches, a land of harsh weather and harsher people. Although no match for an orc or half-orc, these people are at least somewhat worthy of respect, perhaps representing the closest that humanity may ever come to being worthy of Dookan’s respect. These lands will surely put up a great fight, and by Dookan, we’ll give them one!"
 Z50_destroy_gawed_title:0 "Destroy Gawed"
 Z50_destroy_gawed_desc:0 "Although having proven a mighty foe, it has become clear that as long as an eagle banner flies above the Alenic Frontier, there shall always be more who seek to annihilate Grombar in its entirety. As such, we must destroy Gawed once and for all, for only once the Gray King marches through Gaweton, and the land of Gawed itself is all but a distant memory, the peoples of Grombar can never truly be safe."
 Z50_develop_glass_production_title:0 "Develop Glass Production"
 Z50_develop_glass_production_desc:0 "In many of our inland provinces, the main source of income is that of the fur trade. Furs, however, are far from the most profitable of trade goods, especially with ever-increasing competition with the merchants of Gawed. Instead, the region has been found to contain several large sand deposits, most likely left there by the glaciers which retreated to leave the Giant’s Grave, and thus should serve as prime locations for new glassworks."
 Z50_grombari_glass_title:0 "Grombari Glass"
 Z50_grombari_glass_desc:0 "With glass production well underway in the north, the Giant’s Tears also show potential for vast new glassworks. It will be a simple enough matter to apply what we learned in the south to the west, and soon more glass in Cannor will have been made in Grombar than not!"
 Z50_rebuild_bal_vroren_title:0 "Rebuild Bal Vroren"
 Z50_rebuild_bal_vroren_desc:0 "The great citadel of Bal Vroren was abandoned after the Dragonwake, almost a thousand years ago. Locals are still superstitious all these years later, speaking of drakes and the spirits, but we, orcs, are not afraid of dragons and the dead. Even in its current ruined state, this citadel is too mighty to simply be left abandoned. Let us repopulate and rebuild this ancient Castanorian citadel!"
 Z50_start_colonizing_northern_pass_title:0 "Colonize the Northern Pass"
 Z50_start_colonizing_northern_pass_desc:0 "To our east lies the Northern Pass, one of the few ways to bypass the mighty Serpentspine. Though mostly inhabited by goblins, the region is far from densely populated, and thus prime land for our ever-expanding kingdom. In addition, by securing this land for Grombar, so too shall we secure a large buffer zone against any rising dwarven menace that would put an end to us, in their never-ending quest to destroy orckind."
 Z50_found_kara_tarug_title:0 "Found Kara-Tarug"
 Z50_found_kara_tarug_desc:0 "At the center of the northern pass lies the Great Salt Lake, one of the few places in the northern pass not completely covered in forests. Thus, due to both its strategic location and easy land to develop, we shall build a new, fortified city, Kara-Tarug, to serve as a capital in the east. Further and further, the domain of the Gray Kings shall spread!"
 Z50_control_northern_pass_title:0 "Control Northern Pass"
 Z50_control_northern_pass_desc:0 "It has become clear that the dwarves are not the only threat to the east. Rumours abound of one calling themselves the Caehn, who plans to march westward and destroy all that we hold dear. We must not allow this to happen, and in order to accomplish this, the Northern Pass in its entirety must be brought under Grombari control."
 Z50_cities_of_the_northern_pass_title:0 "Cities of the Northern Pass"
 Z50_cities_of_the_northern_pass_desc:0 "Tarugs were initially built as small fortresses in the Northern Pass and protected Grombari settlers from giantkin and goblins, roaming around frozen forests. But without threat, this settlements started to grow rapidly and soon turned from small outposts into booming cities."
 Z50_conquer_serpents_vale_title:0 "Conquer Serpent's Vale"
 Z50_conquer_serpents_vale_desc:0 "Once, the dwarves called the Serpent’s Vale the “Breadbasket of the Dwarovar”. Having fallen into ruin millennia ago, however, it is hard to understand why. Still, despite the desolate nature of the hills of the southern valleys, their strategic value cannot be denied, as by controlling these lands we ensure that any dwarven threat rising from the Kingsrock will be surrounded on all sides by those willing to defend our kingdom."
 Z50_conquer_krakdhumvror_title:0 "Conquer Krakdhumvror"
 Z50_conquer_krakdhumvror_desc:0 "Far to the north, in the Giant’s Anvil, lies Krakdhumvror; Frozenforge. Seemingly untouched by the wars of the rest of the Dwarovar, the dwarves of Krakdhumvror have now been cut off from the rest of the world thanks to our extensive conquests eastward. Despite being dwarves, the mortal enemies of Dookan, the Quartz Dwarves may yet prove to be valuable subjects, as their industrial expertise will no doubt come in handy in the years to come."
 Z50_conquer_celmaldor_title:0 "Conquer Celmaldor"
 Z50_conquer_celmaldor_desc:0 "In the farthest reaches of the north lies the port of Celmadolr, northernmost bastion of the elves. More importantly, however, it is one of the largest ports on the Northern Thaw that is within our reach. As such, it is of vital importance that it is brought within the wider realm of Grombar, in order to project our naval might not just across the Giant’s Grave, but across the entire world."
 Z50_white_harbor_of_celmaldor_title:0 "White Harbor of Celmaldor"
 Z50_white_harbor_of_celmaldor_desc:0 "Originally built to hold the entirety of the mighty Remnant Fleet, the White Harbour has long fallen into disrepair. We, however, have both the resources and the will to restore this mighty port to its former glory, as a true symbol of Grombari naval supremacy. Soon, the Remant Fleet will seem like a small group of fishing boats compared to the Gray Armada!"
 Z50_gray_king_in_the_north_title:0 "Gray King in the North"
 Z50_gray_king_in_the_north_desc:0 "It is done. From Anbennar to the Serpentspine, from Escann to the Frozen North, all of Gerudia, all coasts of the Giant’s Grave, all bow before the heirs of Brasur; the Gray Kings. Though not the richest, our people are certainly the hardiest, bravest, and strongest in all of Cannor, and across the world. For the rest of history, all shall know the kingdom of Grombar, and the realms of the south will tremble before the King in the North!"
 Z50_economic_development_title:0 "Economic Development"
 Z50_economic_development_desc:0 "No longer is Grombar a land bereft of cities and settlements. Now, we have established ourselves as a true economic center in the north, with Grombari markets attracting traders from Escann, the Alenic Reach, Lencenor, Anbennar, and even Bulwar. However, this prosperity is not guaranteed; we must work hard to ensure that our economic prosperity continues well into the future."
 Z50_ordal_fish_market_title:0 "Ordal Fish Market"
 Z50_ordal_fish_market_desc:0 "The Giant’s Grave, with its sheer size and relatively low population surrounding it, has become home to some of the largest fisheries in the world. Constant competition between these fisheries, however, has resulted in prices lowering to an unreasonable degree.

We must endeavor to change this, by dramatically increasing our standards of production. Made in Grombar will soon be synonymous with luxury!"

 Z50_subjugate_rebellious_tribes_desc:0 "Though the Broken Jaw have been reigned in, many of our kin still refuse to submit themselves to our rightful rule, and even attacking us from their settlements in the east. We must reign them in, bringing them into the domain of the Gray Kings. Of course, as well as further unifying our people, the influx of population combined with their knowledge of the lands further east will make our expansion into the lands north of the Serpentspine all the easier."

 Z50_conquest_of_olavlund_desc:0 "Further north, in the Fjords of the Gerudian Coast, lies Olavslund, home to some of the only fertile farmland in the far north. This alone would be reason enough to seize these lands, but for decades now northern raiders have been terrorising our coasts, attacking in the dead of night, using the tactics of a coward. Now, they will have nowhere to run, no sea to retreat to, no darkness to ambush from. The Olavish will face us head on, and like all who have faced us before, they will surely crumble."
 Z50_no_more_songs_title:0 "No More Songs"
 Z50_no_more_songs_desc:0 "In the far reaches of the Gerudian Coast lies the domain of the Skald-Priests of Skaldskola. For millennia, they have sung meaningless songs to a nonexistent god. Worse still, many of their tales directly mock our people, depicting us orcs as a savage, warlike people with no sense of civilization. We will put an end to this mockery for good, as we burn their tales and sing of the foolishness of Gerudians. Who will be laughing then?"

 Z50_control_giants_isles_desc:0 "Scattered throughout the Giant’s Grave lie several island chains, most notably the Drowned Giant Isles and the Giant’s Manse.

 Z50_naval_base_title:0 "Naval Center"
 Z50_naval_base_desc:0 "The Giant’s Manse lies in the center of the Giant’s Grave, and it can be almost certain that whoever controls it will have a vast advantage over any nation in the region, being able to easily supply fleets and armies across the sea without overstretching supply lines. As such, we shall build up this island into a great naval center like no other, to build up the Gray Fleet to even further heights. It will also surely serve as a potent supply station for the final conquest of the rest of Gerudia."

 Z50_invade_dalr_desc:0 "To our west lies the last and mightiest of the Gerudian realms; Bjarnrik. In order to ensure our total dominance of the lands of the north, the bear-kings must be brought to heel. Only then, with the mighty Fjords and Forests of the north under Grombari Command, will we be able to truly call ourselves the lords and protectors of Gerudia. Bjarnrik will come to an end, and so to shall end the days when Gerudians ever thought themselves mightier than orcs."

 Z50_iron_mines_of_dwaroval_desc:0 "Our former home, the Serpentspine, is home to some of the largest deposits of minerals in the known world. Though we do not control any territory within the tunnels themselves, in the lands surrounding the mountains it is easy enough to tap into the vast veins of metal that made the dwarves so rich. Dwaroval seems most suited for the beginning of these extraction operations, with large iron deposits already being discovered there. We’ll steal the dwarves’ riches from right under their noses!"

 Z50_beginning_of_industrialization_desc:0 "More valuable than gold, mithril, or even damestear, coal promises to push the world into a new age of industry and artifice. Across Grombar, coal deposits have been uncovered, and vast furnaces are now being established to power the beginnings of a new age. Long gone are the memories of a desperate group of warriors wandering the northern forests, replaced with the view of a bright future beyond imagination."

 Z50_destroy_ebonfrosts_successors_desc:0 "Once, before the Graytide, in a time the humans call the Era of Black Ice, the Jarldom of Urviksten stood at the head of an empire stretching across all of Escann. Under Castan Ebonfrost, the people of Urviksten almost succeeded in conquering all of Cannor. Now, however, though thoroughly defeated and contained to the eastern reaches of Gerudia, the heirs of Ebonfrost still harbor ambitions of recreating their centuries-old conquests. We must nip this in the bud here and now, and demonstrate that even the mightiest of human warriors are no match for an orc!"
 Z50_colonize_gerudian_coast_title:0 "Colonize Gerudian Coast"
 Z50_colonize_gerudian_coast_desc:0 "To our north lies the untamed land of Giantsmarch, which divides our kingdom from the lands of old Gerudia. This land, though long unclaimed, is of great strategic importance, serving as a potential invasion route both north and south, as well as acting as a potential new port for our growing fleets. Therefore, the local orcs must be brought into the fold of the Gray Kings as soon as possible. After all, if we don’t take it, the Gerudians certainly will."

 Z50_first_orcish_fleet_desc:0 "Though orcs have not had access to the sea for all of our history, let alone a navy, that does not mean we should not build one now. In order to secure the future of the first orcish kingdom, we must ensure that our enemies cannot simply land their armies behind our backs. Rather, we will build the first fleet that orckind has ever seen; a fleet large enough to put those of humanity to shame! For the first orc fleet shall also be the greatest, not just in the Giant’s Grave, but across the world."
 Z50_naval_nation_title:0 "Naval Nation"
 Z50_naval_nation_desc:0 "Having a fleet means nothing if it is at the bottom of the sea. We must ensure that the Gray Fleet is not only the largest in the Giant’s Grave, but able to defeat all our rivals’ fleets combined! Only then will Grombar be truly secure, as the rightful masters of the Giant’s Grave, and all the lands that surround it."

 Z50_colony_in_dalaire_desc:0 "Far to the west, beyond the ocean, lies Aelantir, the homeland of the elves, ruined like so much else the elves get their hands on. Nonetheless, the lands closest to us present certain opportunities, and a powerbase in Aelantir would certainly be a boon to Grombar in the years to come, both in terms of the economic opportunities of this lost continent, and to keep an eye on the rising elven empires further south."
 Z50_grombari_melting_pot_title:0 "Grombari Melting Pot"
 Z50_grombari_melting_pot_desc:0 "Though for years humans and orcs have been at odds, here in Grombar, our two peoples have come together in one great nation. In the streets of our cities, one can see trade, friendship, and even love blossoming between human and orc. No human or orc is slave to another, and all work together in order to achieve a brighter future."
 Z50_new_faces_of_northmen_title:0 "New faces of Northmen"
 Z50_new_faces_of_northmen_desc:0 "Once, the lands of the north were home to the various realms of humanity; Gerudians, Reachmen, Escanni. Now, however, these peoples have merged into one, along with the gray orcs who now also call the north their home. No longer are our lands those of humans or orcs. Now, when a southerner visits the north, they see a land not of humans or orcs, but of half-orcs, the true heirs to Grombar’s future."
 Z50_brother_countries_title:0 "Brother Countries"
 Z50_brother_countries_desc:0 "Though we are by far the greatest of the half-orc kingdoms, we are by no means alone. Across Escann, and even in Aelantir, new half-orc realms are being established. In order to secure the continued existence of half-orcs on the continent, we must take our half-orc brothers under the protective wing of the kingdom of Grombar."
 Z50_strong_kingdom_policy_title:0 "Strong Kingdom Policy"
 Z50_strong_kingdom_policy_desc:0 "Though some would argue that all races are equally strong in their own way, it is clear to us that orcs and half-orcs are stronger than others. The fact of the matter is that in this world, the strong rule, and the weak are conquered. It just so happens that in every case in Grombar, the strong are orcs, and the weak are everyone else."
 Z50_weak_do_not_live_in_grombar_title:0 "No Home for the Weak"
 Z50_weak_do_not_live_in_grombar_desc:0 "The core lands of Grombar, the center of our kingdom, must be fully settled by the strong. The humans, quite clearly, after all of their lands that we have conquered, are weak. After all, had they not been weak, they would not have been conquered by Grombar in the first place. Thus, it is only right that these lands become home of only the strongest."
 Z50_human_segregation_title:0 "Human Segregation"
 Z50_human_segregation_desc:0 "Humans, being weak, have lost the right to exist alongside orcs in the core of Grombar. This is not cruelty on the Gray King’s part, but rather mercy. By banishing the human population to the cold, harsh regions on the fringes of Grombar, it may well be that the humans will someday become strong enough to rejoin wider orcish society. Who knows, in a few centuries they may even be considered our equals, as ridiculous as that sounds. For now though, humanity has been segregated from orckind, purely for the betterment of the humans, of course."

However, Ricard of Vanbury, the claimant to the throne, was also the son of a Siloriel of Lorent, the principal rivals of Gawed. This sparked a war of succession, with Ricard aided by the nominal 'Ioriellan Empire' (Lorent and its sphere of influence under Ioriel) against the anti-Iorielist forces (much of Gawed), who was secretly being funded by Jexis, the Empress of the Phoenix Empire.\n\nThe war ended in 1162 with Ricard claiming the throne, and was eventually known as a liberal and modernizing figure - always striving to integrate Gawed with the new elvenized way of things... until we were deposed by the uncivilized anti-elf brutes of the House of Baldfather during the Greatwood Uprising of 1170, two years after Ioriel's death."

Orston is a de jure part of Exwes, but our right to represent the halflings of the empire should give us claims to this land. We can petition the emperor to cede these lands to us.

After the Viswall rebellion in 1423, they entered a bit of an agreement for a while to split the Small Country in half. However neither side is content with leaving their rival with half the Small Country. Allying one of these two kingdoms will give us the best opportunity to take Small Country land away from the other.

Some methods of preservation have a value beyond just lasting longer though. Salt-curing strips of pork creates a delicious food. Greater production from the Strip allows more to be brought to Beepeck, and for experiments in new tastes.

 A12_house_stacking_desc:0 "Halfling house stacking is a famous architecture technique created in Viswall after the Viswall Rebellion. The partition of the city into two halves, and defined borders eliminated the ability for the city to grow further outwards. So instead they grew their city upwards. It's not literally full houses stacked on top of each other, but rather multi-floor buildings with different houses on each floor. Beepeck's peninsula is getting crowded, so introducing this technique will allow for easier growth."

This land includes the halfling city of Turnwell, which would already be a part of the Small Country if not for outsider meddling.

Long ago, we mined the mountains for a variety of ores and precious gems, though years of neglect led to several of the tunnels collapsing and never opening again. Now, as we seek new wealth to support our Kingdom, we must reopen the mines of Maghargma and see what remains within the earth around us."

 maghargma_supreme_ogrelord_desc:0 "The title of Mengurkha, Ruler of Ogres, has been the true title of our King for eons, though many claim that we have not deserved such a distinguished position.
