 #Events
 bim_lau_flavour.1.t:0 "The Future Of Our Country"
 bim_lau_flavour.1.d:0 "The great necropolis of Bim Lau protected the city for over one thousand years, until its defenses were broken by Jaher. Since then, Bim Lau has lost much of its power and even fallen under Harimari rule.\nThe population, however, still follows the ancient rites and worships the ancestors entombed under the city. Now that the old nexus seems to begin to recover from the destruction Jaher wrought, we have to reconsider our position.\n\nOnly recently has Bim Lau lost much of its land and power to rivals in the north and south. The situation of our ruling monarch has become precarious. In order to lead Bim Lau into a brighter future, a change of leader - a visionary, even - may be required. There are, however, different candidates with different plans fighting for the throne. We should decide who to support."
 bim_lau_flavour.1.a:0 "Choose the eldest son."
 bim_lau_flavour.1.b:0 "Choose the Harimari warlord."
 bim_lau_flavour.1.c:0 "Let the estates decide."
 bim_lau_flavour.3.t:0 "The succession"
 bim_lau_flavour.3.d:0 "The time has come for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to abdicate the throne and make way for his successor.\nOnly time will tell how the old monarch will fare after the inglorious end of his reign."
 bim_lau_flavour.3.a:0 "My eldest son will lead the nation."
 bim_lau_flavour.3.b:0 "This warlord will lead Bim Lau to greatness."
 bim_lau_flavour.3.c:0 "Follow the advice of the estates."
 bim_lau_flavour.3.e:0 "This is unacceptable. Our dynasty must continue."
 bim_lau_flavour.5.t:0 "Entombment In The Great Necropolis"
 bim_lau_flavour.5.d:0 "With the death of the previous ruler, the duty of organising a proper procession, ceremony, and entombment for them falls upon [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]. Naturally we shall conduct these activities at our holiest resting place: The Great Necropolis of Bim Lau. How extravagant we make this ceremony is up for debate...\n\nIf we appease the spirit of the deceased with an opulent ceremony we might even be able to count on help from the afterlife as long as the spirit resides in the necropolis."
 bim_lau_flavour.5.a:0 "A ceremony worthy of a grand spirit"
 bim_lau_flavour.5.b:0 "A regular ceremony is more fitting"
 bim_lau_flavour.5.c:0 "This is between the family and the tomb"
 bim_lau_flavour.6.t:0 "Entomb Enemy General?"
 bim_lau_flavour.6.d:0 "During the last war, our troops captured the body of a fallen enemy general. While he stood against us in life, he was still a talented leader and impressive tactician. We could honor him by entombing him alongside our own in the necropolis of Bim Lau."
 bim_lau_flavour.6.a:0 "Lay him to rest."
 bim_lau_flavour.6.b:0 "He does not belong here."
 bim_lau_flavour.7.t:0 "Death of a General"
 bim_lau_flavour.7.d:0 "The recent death of a prestigious officer has led to much mourning over the last days. Now his relatives and friends have petitioned the crown to allow his entombment in the great necropolis of Bim Lau. We might even be able to further rely on his advice while his spirit resides in the necropolis."
 bim_lau_flavour.7.a:0 "Arrange the entombment"
 bim_lau_flavour.7.b:0 "Deny the request"
 bim_lau_flavour.8.t:0 "Death of an Official"
 bim_lau_flavour.8.d:0 "The recent death of a high ranking official in our administration is considered a great tragedy among higher circles. Some friends of the deceased have now inquired if an entombment in the great necropolis of Bim Lau would be permissible. We might even be able to further rely on his advice while his spirit resides in the necropolis."
 bim_lau_flavour.8.a:0 "Arrange the entombment"
 bim_lau_flavour.8.b:0 "Deny the request"
 bim_lau_flavour.9.t:0 "Death of a War Mage"
 bim_lau_flavour.9.d:0 "The recent death of a highly decorated war mage in our employ has led to fears that we might be unable to maintain the quality of our mages. While the repercussions of this death are as of yet unknown, we might be able to distract the people with a grand ceremony to entomb the mage. We might even be able to further rely on his advice while his spirit resides in the necropolis."
 bim_lau_flavour.9.a:0 "Do it"
 bim_lau_flavour.9.b:0 "There's no need"
 bim_lau_flavour.10.t:0 "Death of a Court Mage"
 bim_lau_flavour.10.d:0 "One of our court mages has recently left his mortal coil. As a high ranking royal official, it would not be strange to entomb him with a grand ceremony in the great necropolis of Bim Lau. We might even be able to further rely on his advice while his spirit resides in the necropolis."
 bim_lau_flavour.10.a:0 "Prepare the entombment"
 bim_lau_flavour.10.b:0 "It is a needless expense."
 bim_lau_flavour.11.t:0 "Graverobbers!"
 bim_lau_flavour.11.d:0 "Graverobbers have entered the great necropolis and absconded with treasures of great worth. This transgression might provoke the ire of the ancestor spirits. We should send out hunters and return the stolen relics to their rightful place."
 bim_lau_flavour.11.a:0 "Hunt them!"
 bim_lau_flavour.11.b:0 "Let them leave."
 bim_lau_flavour.12.t:0 "Spirits Leaving"
 bim_lau_flavour.12.d:0 "It seems our inability to appease the spirits of the great necropolis has led to some spirits leaving. This will certainly weaken the ancient powers of the city."
 bim_lau_flavour.12.a:0 "Try to stop them"
 bim_lau_flavour.12.b:0 "Let them leave."
 bim_lau_flavour.13.t:0 "Spiritual Cataclysm"
 bim_lau_flavour.13.d:0 "Our continued inability to appease the ancestor spirits of Bim Lau has led to a sort of spiritual rebellion. All over the country our soldiers and officials are hindered in their duties by angry spirits and strange magical phenomena. While the population at large remains mostly unbothered, we should try to alleviate the situation as soon as possible."

 bim_lau_flavour.14.t:0 "Spirits Appeased"
 bim_lau_flavour.14.d:0 "We have managed to appease the spirits of the necropolis. They have returned to their tombs, and our state can operate in peace once again."
 bim_lau_flavour.14.a:0 "Great!"
 bim_lau_flavour.15.t:0 "Earthquake in the Necropolis"
 bim_lau_flavour.15.d:0 "Today Bim Lau was shaken by a strong quake. As far as our mages were able to tell, the earthquake was not natural, but rather caused by some magical effect deep in the necropolis. It seems most likely that the spirits are showing their fury through such actions.\nWhile there were not many living victims, the necropolis itself seems to have been damaged extensively."
 bim_lau_flavour.15.a:0 "We can only try to rebuild."
 bim_lau_flavour.16.t:0 "Fortifications Damaged"
 bim_lau_flavour.16.d:0 "We have received reports that angry spirits have damaged a number of fortifications around the country. While the garrisons were mostly able to repair the damage, our military standing as a whole was weakened as less troops were available for their usual duties."
 bim_lau_flavour.16.a:0 "Damn."
 bim_lau_flavour.17.t:0 "Spirits Cause Mass Panic"
 bim_lau_flavour.17.d:0 "According to our reports, spirits have begun causing panic amongst our citizens by using illusions and causing strange magical effects on people. While they seem to restrain themselves to non-lethal attacks, our administration is thinly stretched by a deluge of complaints and requests for help."
 bim_lau_flavour.17.a:0 "Assign more officers."
 bim_lau_flavour.18.t:0 "Artwork Destroyed"
 bim_lau_flavour.18.d:0 "Spirits in Bim Lau have begun to destroy parts of the Necropolis itself. Mostly frescoes, ancient statues, and artwork seem to attract their ire. Their actions seem to spur further spirits - that have stayed in their tombs until now - to anger, which will lead to even more chaos later on."
 bim_lau_flavour.18.a:0 "Those ancient treasures were priceless."
 bim_lau_flavour.20.t:0 "A Harimari Capital"
 bim_lau_flavour.20.d:0 "With our conquest of Khiraspid, we have for the first time the chance to establish a Harimari capital in Rahen for our nation. While the seat of our power is still Bomdan, a capital in Rahen might be what is needed to lead the way west."
 bim_lau_flavour.20.a:0 "Make Khiraspid the new capital."
 bim_lau_flavour.20.b:0 "Bim Lau should stay the center of our power."
