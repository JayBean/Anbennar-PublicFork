 G79_appease_the_north_title:0 "Appease the North"
 G79_appease_the_north_desc:0 "Born in Larankharan Hills, the fledgling kingdom of Larankar has proven to have potential to become  a hegemon of northern Taychend. With our expansion in the east and south, we have not yet crossed our spears with their sabres. Though some Taychendi think having allies is a sign of weakness, they probably have never been cornered by two jaguars seeking their prey together. Only time will tell how soon the jaguars will jump at their own throats."

 G79_consolidate_the_cape_title:0 "Consolidate the Cape"
 G79_consolidate_the_cape_desc:0 "Our domain stretches from the tip of Thekvussam cape to the north, along the Kila Toram, on the very east of Taychend. The lands we rule are rich and on crossroads of many important trade routes - the Old Loop, the Path of Wine and the Straight Road. To our west, behind petty kingdoms of Sthanan ith Vussam and Nagar Vyechei Kheionai of Ameion have landed and began their invasion. If we want to become more than just a passing wind in annals of history, we must unite the Thekvussam."

 G79_look_into_the_sky_title:0 "Look Into the Sky"
 G79_look_into_the_sky_desc:0 "To the south of our capital, just north of the tip of Thekvussam lie the rugged hills of Uyarbaid. There live hill tribes of Yodhanpir descent, who we have not yet fully integrated into [Root.GetName]. They are a peculiar bunch, worshipping great storms that frame the cape and storm serpents that live in them. In their villages they revere powerful relics that can create localised storms and control weather. While our cooperation with them has been loose until now, should we integrate them, we will be able to wield this fearsome power for our own goals."
 G79_look_into_the_sky_ei_tt:0 "\n§GEvent Insight§!\nWhether through cooperation or assimilation of tribes living in hills of Uyarbaid, we came in contact with ancient relics allowing for manipulation and harnessing the power of storms that surround the Thekvussam Cape."

 G79_taking_a_stand_title:0 "Taking a Stand"
 G79_taking_a_stand_desc:0 "The Kheionai of Ameion think they can invade our lands, raze our cities and kill our people! This cannot stand. Weak kingdoms of Nagar Vyechei, ailing remnants of Gophiran Empire, weak scholars of Sthanan ith Vussam all of them destroyed in one fell swoop, unable to stand against Laskaris might. Some Taychendi even started to worship him as a god! We must put an end to their incursion and wrestle back the reins of fate, they claim to rule over. Taychend suffers no interloper!"

 G79_cut_fate_short_title:0 "Cut Fate Short"
 G79_cut_fate_short_desc:0 "The oracle of Korrimutern foretold that Laskaris shall become a great conqueror that shall rule over Taychend and forge a great empire. Many believe these prophecies and cower in fear before Kheionai invaders. Yet fate is a fickle thing - the oracle may believe it was written as it had told, but we know better - fate is but a shapeless clay that can be moulded into whatever form a skilled artisan wishes. He only needs a chisel and a hammer - determination and will to fight."

 G79_brother_against_brother_title:0 "Brother Against Brother"
 G79_brother_against_brother_desc:0 "The tensions among the half-Kheionai and adherents to Taychendi traditions have reached the tipping point and only bloodshed can ease them. No matter the side that wins, it is certain they will strongarm our state so it is reshaped in their image. What shall be the fate of [Root.GetName]? Only the field of battle knows the answer to that question. We must weather the storm."

 G79_subjugate_the_bandits_title:0 "Subjugate the Bandits"
 G79_subjugate_the_bandits_desc:0 "To our north exist warlords most paradoxical - they claim legitimacy, yet they are nothing more than bandits that claimed a city as their base of operations and put crowns on their head. The honourless outlaws they employ scour the lands north to us and disrupt the flow of trade with Yodhandchend. Bandits only care about two things when choosing their leaders - strength and coin. Let us show them we have both aplenty and they may yet be of use to us."
 G79_subjugate_the_bandits_effect_tt:0 "Disable the '§YVolisi Vara Bandit Swordsmen§!' Mercenary Company for every other country"

 G79_breadbasket_of_the_south_title:0 "Breadbasket of the South"
 G79_breadbasket_of_the_south_desc:0 "Stormy clouds of Thekvussam are a danger at seas, but the swirling warm air that flows from them to the shores of the cape, combined with fertile lands of Tirsin and Vuls Tenvach, provides a perfect climate for developing agriculture. Yet, constant warfare in the area has never allowed us to fully tap into the potential these farmlands can bring. Developing fortified granaries inside of temples should help with protecting the surplus of food for our armies - after all an army marches on its stomach."

 G79_rule_thekvussam_title:0 "Rule the Thekvussam"
 G79_rule_thekvussam_desc:0 "Outsiders may think that Thekvussam is just a small piece of land, yet this would show they do not understand its nature. Thekvussam is not just the cape itself, but also waves that relentlessly buffet the rocks on beaches, swirling dark clouds that brighten with lightning arcs and the wind that carries taste of salt to our tongues. We cannot call ourselves rules of Thekvussam if we were to only take hold of the land. To rule Thekvussam we must rule the seas around it as well."
 G79_rule_thekvussam_hired_ships_tt:0 "If we complete this mission while having '§YHired Private Ships§!' country modifier:"

 G79_calm_before_the_storm_title:0 "Calm Before the Storm"
 G79_calm_before_the_storm_desc:0 "Our sailors leave out to the sea when torrential rains hit the wooden decks and winds howls in their ears. They do so, for they know the danger that awaits them, they see their enemy and can react to its strikes. There is nothing as dangerous as a calm sea to a Thekvrystana sailor - in one second it appears to lull the crew, just to end lives innumerable with one powerful strike of lightning. We should let our enemies sleep… Let them forget the fury the South can unleash."
 G79_calm_before_the_storm_effect_tt:0 "§YEvery known country§! with §Ycapital§! in §YTaychend§! superregion will lose §G-15.00§! aggresive expansion against §Y[Root.GetName]§!."

 G79_clear_the_clouded_skies_title:0 "Clear the Clouded Skies"
 G79_clear_the_clouded_skies_desc:0 "The more we conquer the more we spread ourselves thin. If there is anything we have learned from histories the scholars of Sthanan ith Vussam kept, it is that loyalties change and the path to become a foe is easy to traverse for a “friend”. We have experienced it first hand when half-Kheionai and adherents to tradition in our kingdom incited a civil war. Like a skilled sailor seeing stormy clouds on the horizon we must avoid trouble. Contrary to them - we shall clear these clouds from the sky  ourselves."
 G79_clear_the_clouded_skies_effect_tt:0 "Lose §G10§! years of separatism in §YEvery owned province§!."

 G79_heir_of_conquerors_title:0 "Heirs of Conquerors"
 G79_heir_of_conquerors_desc:0 "Our knowledge does not come from reading dusty old  tomes, nor does it come from philosophical debates. What we know is what we have learned through action - through mistakes of ourselves and those who came before us. We have bested the Kheionai invaders, we destroyed the remnants of the Gophiran empire, the Blue House is subservient to us and only few still avoid our rule. The greatest lesson they have taught us? As long as opposition exists it shall be a nuisance. And so they must perish."
 G79_heir_of_conquerors_ei_tt:0 "\n§GEvent Insight§!\nOur continued study on the weather-altering relics left by Slaver-Nobles has proven useful. Our Mages assure us that latent magical energy found in them can be used to unleash a storm of unimaginable proportions that will sweep through all of Taychend."

 G79_ameioni_lessons_title:0 "Ameioni Lessons"
 G79_ameioni_lessons_desc:0 "The Ameioni were bested by us, but not without losses on our side. Their professional phalanx bested our levies and if it was not for our zeal and personal bravery, surely would they best us. Times change and we cannot hope for heroes to rise through our ranks once again. We must take inspiration from the Kheionai invaders and rethink our armies - no more shall peasants take up arms before they learn how to swing them, no more shall we send them into the battle without teaching them how personal glory intertwines with the discipline of trained infantry."
 G79_ameioni_lessons_effect_tt:0 "Up to §Y10§! provinces which have a §YManpower Building§! built gain §G1§! Base Manpower."

 G79_echoes_of_storm_title:0 "Echoes of Storm"
 G79_echoes_of_storm_desc:0 "The skies have closed and the rain has stopped. Murmurs of a terrifying typhoon subsided and left silence in their wake, broken sparingly by nature coming back to life. The [Root.GetAdjective] storm has surprised even the warlords, who thought they could be sheltered from the storm that will engulf their lands. What the storm has razed shall form the rubbles upon which a new power shall rise and the valleys of Taychend shall echo the sound of our thunderous advance!"
 G79_echoes_of_storm_effect_tt:0 "Declaring a war while at peace, grants '§YThunderous Advance§!' for §Y18 months§!, giving the following effects:\nMovement Speed: §G+20.0%§!\nFleet Movement Speed: §G+2.00§!\n\nWinning war, while this modifier is active, gives §G50§!

 G79_mastery_of_commerce_title:0 "Mastery of Commerce"
 G79_mastery_of_commerce_desc:0 "If there is one thing that can turn a sword around it’s coin. The clattering of coins in a pouch can turn the wildest of scowls into a friendly grin and transform the dreams of unfulfilled glory into complacency. Many warlords of Taychend were rich, taking spoils and relics as personal rewards - yet this only led to a greater hunger inside of those soldiers who broke through the gates of walled cities too late. If we want our empire to last, we must ensure the flow of goods - and coin - remains uninterrupted."
 G79_mastery_of_commerce_tsr_req_tt:0 "If we complete the mission by improving provinces belonging to §YThe Straight Road§!:"

 G79_the_taken_port_title:0 "The Taken Port"
 G79_the_taken_port_desc:0 "Orenkoraim controls the vital estuary of Kalavend river, controlling the trade that flows in and out of Northern Taychend, while also extending their arm for the goods travelling alongside the shores of Taychend. Orenkoraimi like to think of their little island as “untaken”. The knowledge about the art of siege, our Kheionai advisors have brought with them, surely will make them change this pretentious name."
 G79_the_taken_port_yes_effect_tt:0 "£yes£ If [6559.GetName] has both a §YDock Building§! and a §YShipyard Building§! built gain §G100.00§! Crowns.\n"

 G79_control_the_islands_title:0 "Control the Islands"
 G79_control_the_islands_desc:0 "When we first fought against Ameion we faced a hegemon, with mortal spear in hand and shield of fate in hand. The hegemon has failed, fallen under the weight of its own hubris, yet they still controlled the seas of Taychend. Now our navy is ready to fight against them, equipped with the very weapons Kheionai brought to Taychend. We cannot just become Kheionai, we must be better with them, learning from their arts to create something they never could - an empire that shall last."

Our shipyard in [2520.GetName] is bigger and more perfect than Kheionai could ever imagine, able to produce multiple of these titans at once. Yet seeing the power we wield with these ships, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cannot help, but to wonder - are Kheionai designs the limit of what can be created? Can we launch what they never could? A vessel so large that shores themself shall tremble with echoes of its weapons…"

 G79_great_house_enshrined_title:0 "Great House Enshrined"
 G79_great_house_enshrined_desc:0 "Vuls Tenvach means a “Great House”. Truly our name reflects who we are - for we do not cut down those who oppose us and destroy them. We grasp their weapons and like a good father stow it away so they do not hurt themselves. Many Taychendi do not see it yet, but they soon shall that only by them becoming parts of the Great House Taychend shall become united. It shall be their choice, whether we greet them with open arms as sons and daughters or with a whip in our hands."

 G79_artists_of_taychend_title:0 "Artists of Taychend"
 G79_artists_of_taychend_desc:0 "Thekvrystana are a curious bunch of Taychendi. They do not ride fearsome beasts to battle, nor are they masters of arms. What differentiates them from others is how they can channel their passion outside of war, outside of battle. The brilliance of Nanru Nakar, the sublime beauty of Nagar Vyechei, even the newly created mosaics of Kottar Orenkoraim, all of them have employed artists originating from our homelands. Why should they decorate foreign palaces when we ourselves are worthy of their works?"

 G79_empire_of_cities_title:0 "Empire of Cities"
 G79_empire_of_cities_desc:0 "Many kingdoms and empires that rose in Taychend were centred around cities left behind by Slaver-Nobles. They all collapsed and were destroyed because of how those “empires” took care of what they inherited, living among rubble, half-collapsed mansions and reinforcing them with scraps of metal and stone. Our empire shall be different - the cities will once again be full of life, like hearts supplied with precious blood through the veins of our carefully maintained trade routes."
 G79_empire_of_cities_ei_tt:0 "\n§GEvent Insight§!\nCaravans going in and out, every single one carrying unimaginable riches. With our fatherly care, we have turned the Straight Road into the greatest trade route in all of Taychend."

 flavour_vulstenvach.1.d:0 "The spire standing in the middle of the village was unremarkable at first glance, until a watchful gaze carefully studied its base and saw the visible blue veins of magic, dancing on the surface. The elder of the tribe, visibly older than [Root.Monarch.GetName], attentively heard what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had said.\n\n“What shall we get in return for this cooperation, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]? Why don’t you just come and seize what you wish? Why don’t you kill us and destroy what we revere?”\n\n“Elder, we won’t do so, because we need you. You too are part of the Great House of Vuls Tenvach, our brother and sisters. What makes us different is how we dress, how we pronounce ourselves, but what makes us the same is our hearts and our attunement with the storms around us. We are quiet people, reserved with fury brewing in our souls, ready to lash at foreigners who try to use us, and so are you.”\n\nThe elder weighed the words of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and after a brief moment of silence responded “Very well, we shall consider you as our brethren. Let us wield the storms together”, he extended his arm."

 flavour_vulstenvach.2.d:0 "As [Root.GetAdjective] armies enter yet another city occupied by Kheionai invaders, the resistance is visibly weaker. Those few Kheionai and their Taychendi allies who still retain the loyalty to Ambhen Synkletos fight to the bitter end, aware they shall be given no quarter. The food is no longer delivered with [Root.GetName] controlling the southern coast of Taychend in its entirety, effectively severing the connection between Ameion and its conquests, carved from Taychend after Laskaris’ invasion.\n\nAfter days and weeks have passed the armies of Ameion are nowhere to be seen. Sparingly, a vessel flying Ameioni colours comes close enough to see the coast and is greeted with a hail of arrows from the shore, sent flying by watchmen. Soon enough, even these vessels disappear and the silence of southern Taychend gives way to the hum of everyday life - without the Kheionai chain crippling it. Only silent whispers passed on by traders confirm what everyone thought - the war is over, Ameion has left their conquests. The very same whispers tell that [Root.Monarch.GetName] was declared an enemy of Ambhen - perhaps the greatest title a mortal ruler could hope for.\n\nMany Taychendi look to us as great victors, who have saved them from the terrible fate the Ambhen have prepared for them, yet with the invader gone, old loyalties are resurfacing. Our lot will be remembered by Taychendi to come, the question is, how shall they remember us?"

It is said, the house divided against itself cannot stand, and this is true also of the Great House of Vuls Tenvach. As the Ambhen infiltrated the social fabric of Taychendi, their ideas and philosophies have ingrained into the mind of common folk and, perhaps more importantly, elites.\n\nBut those fools who have fallen to foreign ideas are no longer among us, having decided to betray the ideas of Taychendi and ally themselves with Ambhen invaders. As their power lies broken and they are left to lick their wounds as pariahs, the status of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has only strengthened, being seen as a powerful warlord, ready to destroy the opposition. Already the neighbours of Vuls Tenvach cower in fear, as they hear about the victories of [Root.Monarch.GetName].

A new class has risen, sons and daughters of Kheionai and Taychendi locals, the bluish hue of their skin distinguishing them from the lowborn peasants. First among them - Olorises. Once nothing more but a glory-seeker and adventurer, bastard to old Alvardip, now a strong monarch, wearing the helmet of Laskaris in place of a crown. To his left and his right a host of Kheionaised elites, philosophers, generals.

The air around the ritual site hummed. At the centre stood the elder, whose ancestor and ancestor of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] met long ago. As they invoked the ancient words, the skies above turned an unnatural shade of black, thick and menacing, as though the skies themselves had been summoned to bend before the power of [Root.GetName].\n\nThunder rumbled in the distance, but it was not the ordinary call of a storm—it was the voice of something primal, something beyond this world. Lightning cracked through the clouds, not in erratic bolts, but in deliberate strikes, like the wrathful fingers of the gods reaching down. The winds began to whip furiously around the circle of relics, pulling at the earth and sending debris spiralling into the air.\n\nSuddenly, the storm above took shape—towering, whirling, and all-encompassing, a vortex of raw elemental fury. It churned and twisted, faster and faster, drawing in the very essence of the relics until, with a deafening roar, it erupted outward. The storm did not merely stay confined to the ritual site. It spread—first across the sky above Uyarbaid, then across the borders of the land, its reach endless, as if guided by an unseen hand. What was left at the ritual site was heavy, unnatural silence. But in the hearts of all who witnessed it, a deep fear and awe remained - a knowledge that the sky itself had been bent to the will of [Root.GetName], and from that day forward, no land would stand defiant without feeling the weight of the tempest ready to be summoned once more."

Their laughter and their fun was cut short by cries of their concerned mothers. “Come home my child! The skies darken!”\n\nIn one sudden moment, the spotless sky turned grey, then black and droplets of rain like arrows struck the land beneath. One second after another, the sound of the rain turned from a broken humm to a sound of boulders crushing into the walls. Noone knows if cries of concerned mothers and scared children continued, for they were drowned out by the overwhelming noise of nature's fury.\n\nThe rain poured out of the sky for a day and the night straight. Those lucky enough not to drown in mere minutes were kept at night with the booming sound of lightning bolts striking the land beneath. When the sun rose and pierced the veil of clouds, the few survivors looked at their city completely ruined with raging fires and rivers of mud in the street.

But, Your Highness, we should go, as the dust in the air is bad for one’s health.

Below him a street full of workers corrected the cobblestone on a perfectly measured angle of a main artery. Winding streets of old have been cleared and corrected, reflecting the well thought out nature of the new Kheionai elite who moved into the city. The street cuts through the middle of the city, connecting the palace with a massive port in Kheionai style. Using the knowledge of Kheionai shipbuilding a drydock was constructed and inside of it a wooden skeleton of a new [Root.GetAdjective] Degárikes. “And” asked the architect “What do you think, your Highness?”"

Oranges and spices!” shouts an elderly woman, shouting the price that is heard to catch among the hoofbeat of horses carrying opulent carriages full of textiles, or oxes dragging much more modest wagons with fresh fruits and vegetables. To move in the crowd that attends marketplaces along the Straight Road is to follow a wave who goes from booth to booth, shelling out money from a sack carried on the belt.\n\nAt once people make way for a patrol of scouts, riding along the road, waiting for just a moment just before the gates are opened and they ride off into the heart of Taychend, looking after the travellers of the road. Our care is what caused this scene, our fatherly care that nurtured the Straight Road, the Southern Arc, the Path of Wine and cities alongside it into safe havens for weary travellers."

 flavour_vulstenvach.8.d:0 "It began with a lone Kheionai stirring unrest in [Root.Capital.GetName], boldly starting a brawl in one of the city's crowded markets. His insults were sharp, calling the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a weakling, a coward unworthy of the throne. The brazenness of the act shocked many, but it was the violent aftermath that truly set the city on edge. Three Taychendi, loyal defenders of the hero they revered, stepped forward to put an end to the brawl, but they were no match for the supporters of the insulter. They were left bruised and barely alive, their pride shattered alongside their bodies.\n\nAs the conflict brewed, tensions simmered within the city’s walls. The streets whispered of rebellion, and suspicions grew that this incident was not an isolated outburst but part of a larger, more sinister plan. Guards soon apprehended a blue-skinned fool, clutching a blue ribbon in his trembling hand. He was interrogated harshly, and only after the third strike did he finally break, admitting that he had been sent by the Ambhen Synkletos to fan the flames of half-Kheionai unrest in [Root.GetName].\n\nHis execution was swift and without ceremony. The blade fell, and his treachery was silenced, but the echoes of his actions had already rippled outwards. Though we managed to cut off many heads of the hydra before they could strike, some of them woke, enraged, and lashed back against us with renewed ferocity. Now, the time has come to strike the final blow – to cut off the last head of this beast that dares to threaten us."

 flavour_vulstenvach.9.d:0 "The group that rose against us was of Kheionai origin. Some were children of Kheionai and Taychendi parents, born and bred in the traditions of invaders, while others were agents sent directly by Ameion, carrying out the will of a foreign hand intent on destabilising our lands. None of them, however, remain alive today.\n\nThe battle against them was fierce and brutal. Each rebel was hunted down and fought with the ferocity of a cornered beast. They were more than insurgents; they were symbols of defiance. But one by one, we silenced them. Now their bluish heads rest on spikes, mounted high on the western walls of the cities that housed them. The message is clear: betrayal will not be tolerated. Their deaths mark the end of this particular uprising, but the spikes on the walls remain – a reminder to all who might consider rising against us. There is no glory in rebellion here, only death. Let the Kheionai and their sympathisers see the fate of those who challenge us and know that Vuls Tenvach's will is unbreakable. The heads, turned westward, with their vacant eyes fixed on the lands from which they came, serve as a grim reminder of an ancient truth -"

 flavour_vulstenvach.10.d:0 "Barely had Liandithe Echatos given birth to her son Olorises when she returned to her daring, adventurous ways. Eager to outpace her competition and deliver goods faster, she chose a perilous route along the stormy coast of Thekvussam Cape, fully aware that it could shave days, if not weeks, off her journey. The voyage started swiftly, with fierce winds battering the sails of her Kheionai vessel. Meanwhile, seasoned local sailors watched anxiously, their eyes fixed on the ominous dark clouds gathering above.\n\nBefore long, a violent storm forced them to seek refuge, anchoring at Thekvussam. As the crew scrambled to shield themselves from the torrential rain, they erected a small tent for their captain and her newborn son. While Olorises dozed in a makeshift cradle, his mother, undeterred, helped her crew set up camp. Then, without warning, a blinding flash of lightning tore through the sky, striking the tent where the infant lay.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, the cloth was charred and destroyed—but miraculously, Olorises was not only alive but completely unharmed. The only mark left by the strike was a small, crown-shaped scar on his sternum."

Those who seek solace after death, those who look to gods and heavens, those who seek the supernatural and immaterial when faced with overwhelming questions… They consider themselves conquerors, yet they cannot conquer the fear that lingers in their hearts! They perceive themselves as glorious, yet they are ashamed of the fragility of their lives and spend their days in pursuit of cheap thrills...” - the long oration of the Kheionai philosopher, advisor to Olorises, had only just begun. Many of the elites of the Bastard Prince listened intently, as the speaker sought to dismantle the falsehoods of the Taychendi religion.\n\nOlorises, weary of the oration, suddenly stood up. “And what does it matter, orator? Why do they fight?” - the prince's words clearly shook the philosopher, unaccustomed to his students questioning him. “Some Taychendi may live in fear of death. They run from it for so long that they forget the source of their fear. But they do not run toward the safety of the Kheions, terrified of winds carrying sand. Nor do they flee back to their Nekhéis, afraid of the depths of Devand. No, the Taychendi run from death straight into the arms of another Taychendi, ready to draw their sword, their spear, their shield, and fight. Does it matter if they run, if they have achieved what the Kheionai never could? Does it matter if they fear death, if they are always prepared to face its cold embrace? Does it matter if they believe in gods and heavens, if their actions are as glorious as they would be without this belief?\n\nLet this sink into your mind, philosopher, and into the minds of your listeners. I do not know what awaits me after I die, but even in death, my fame will echo in the ears of my descendants. One day, death shall conquer my body...""
