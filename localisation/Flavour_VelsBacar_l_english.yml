 flavor_vels_bacar.0.t:0 "Trompolere Attacks!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.0.d:0 "War! The Sarda lordships crumble under attacks by the ruthless lord Alaran yen Cestor.\n\n In a stunning move, the young leader of Trompolere dealt a crushing defeat to the armies of both Arverynn and Stanyrhrada to then arrive at the gates of the capital of the old Yrisar. With barely any soldiers left, the coward Calrodiy IV paid a rescue for his city and surrendered both Lesthrom and the oath of the lord of Arvezl in exchange for peace.\n\n Our lands, full of Arverynnic and Stanyrhradan refugees, are now the next objective of this so-called “conqueror”. Where others failed, we will succeed."
 flavor_vels_bacar.0.a:0 "Let them come. Our gates do not break easily." 

 flavor_vels_bacar.2.t:0 "The New Bacarans"
 flavor_vels_bacar.2.d:0 "Fulvyr looked at the sunset, arms resting on a wooden fence. He couldn’t help but wonder if that same sunset would be shining on the treetops of his family’s treehouse in Lesthrom. Three months in the grasslands of Minata had passed in what seemed like an instant, and now they owned land with cattle and crops of their own. And yet…\n\n- Oytec! Oytec! - A small child exclaimed, sprinting from the newly-built house and hugging his legs, bringing a soft smile to Fulvyr’s lips.- Metka says dinner is ready! Let’s go home!\n\nThe elf raised his son in his arms, looking into his eyes for a second. They were here, alive and well, all three of them… perhaps even more, in the future. And as Fulvyr turned away from both sunset and sadness, a word stayed in his mind. Home."
 flavor_vels_bacar.2.a:0 "We’re coming!"

 flavor_vels_bacar.3.t:0 "Alaran yen Cestor Ousted!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.3.d:0 "War! The Sarda lordships crumble under attacks by the ruthless lord Alaran yen Cestor.\n\nIn a stunning move, the young leader of Trompolere dealt a crushing defeat to the armies of both Arverynn and Stanyrhrada to then arrive at the gates of the capital of the old Yrisar. With barely any soldiers left, the coward Calrodiy IV paid a rescue for his city and surrendered both Lesthrom and the oath of the lord of Arvezl in exchange for peace.\n\nRight as our armies prepared for his attack on proud Vels Bacar, however, word arrived of the ousting of the young conqueror by the nobles of his homeland. Yet they haven’t abandoned their conquests or returned the gold and lands to the refugees who fled to our city, and the dead will not return from their forced slumber."
 flavor_vels_bacar.3.a:0 "It is our duty to return balance to the Sarda."

 flavor_vels_bacar.4.t:0 "The Proclamation of Order"
 flavor_vels_bacar.4.d:0 "To all the Sarda, gathered in town or village, forests or plains:\n\nBe it known that I, [Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Vels Bacar, do hereby solemnly swear, upon the honor of the line of Jurion the Honest and the endless flow of the Ynn, to champion the cause of the Sarda people, who have long been divided by strife and discord. \n\nI shall not rest, I shall not falter, I shall not waver, until the Sarda stand united and their realms are at peace.\n\nI shall offer counsel, mediate disputes, and inspire cooperation among us, seeking to weave a tapestry of oaths that shall bind our realms together.\n\nYet, should all peaceful efforts fail and the Sarda people insist on remaining mired in conflict and disarray, I vow to take up the sword, not as a conqueror, but as a unifier.\n\nMay the Ynn bless me and my heirs with the strength, the wisdom, and the courage to uphold this solemn oath until the task is complete.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Vels Bacar."
 flavor_vels_bacar.4.a:0 "So I declare, and so it shall be."

 flavor_vels_bacar.5.t:0 "A Friend's Embrace"
 flavor_vels_bacar.5.d:0 "As the lord was brought out of Stanyrhrada and brought before [Root.Monarch.GetName], he was sure he would die. It was alright, he had made peace with that fact; he fought, he lost, it was the way of things. Yet when he stood before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], silence drew over them.\n\n“[Root.Monarch.GetName].” He spoke at last, words like copper, bitter and cold.\n\n“I’m not here to kill you.” [Root.Monarch.GetName] replied, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] voice rang throughout the hall, “There has been enough killing as of late, and I do not fight for this”\n\n“What is one more?”\n\n“It won’t end with you, or me. This is not how you end bloodshed.” The fighting would continue, whether to avenge this conflict, or as petty feuds like the rest of the Ynn. That is, unless things change  “Our people were united once, yen Bacar and yen Stenur, forever brothers against those who would oppose us.” [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] walked closer, “Can that not be so again?”\n\nThe lord of Stanyrhrada pondered for a moment. “Perhaps, perhaps not.”\n\n“We shall bind our people into one, via your daughter, princess Ariadra. My house and yours, to stand against chaos, to stand as united protectors of the Sarda.”\n\nThe lord closed his eyes, and after a tense pause, he made his choice.”\n\n“Very well.”"
 flavor_vels_bacar.5.a:0 "Shall we never fight again."

 flavor_vels_bacar.6.t:0 "The Kyrrachean Reunion"
 flavor_vels_bacar.6.d:0 "Peasants, artisans, merchants and priests alike massed at the sides of the road leading into Vels Bacar, the main way held open by the two rows of well-equipped Bacaran soldiers. In front of them, the cream of the Sarda nobility entered the city, riding antler horses: the famed Kyrrachean lords led the way: the teal-haired lord of Arverynn, the green-haired yen Stantir and the white-haird yen Stenur. After them, all the other lords of the Lower Ynn followed, with the River Priests of Adbrabohvi closing the march.\n\nA gathering of such magnitude had not been seen since the fall of the Yrisar, the Ynnic Empire, hundreds of years ago.\n\nThey all followed the path down the road, where the imposing procession reached the Halba Hariez. There, at the entrance of the Hall of Colours, [Root.Monarch.GetName] waited, wearing a crown of blue panykorun flowers: the eponymous tree of the yen Bacar, whose name stands for “Lord’s Crown”.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] took off his crown, and one by one each of the Sarda lords swore an oath upon it: to follow the house yen Bacar and to join them as the Panykorun, where they would all have a voice and a vote under the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Vels Bacar.\n\nAt last, [Root.Monarch.GetName] picked up the crown, and swore an oath before wearing it.\n\n“I, [Root.Monarch.GetName], swear upon the Ynn to listen to the Panykorun and govern with it, just as it will rule with me. "
 flavor_vels_bacar.6.a:0 "May we all rule the Sarda as one!"

 flavor_vels_bacar.7.t:0 "Scrolls from Adrabohvi"
 flavor_vels_bacar.7.d:0 "“An envoy has arrived from Adbrabohvi, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], bringing an ancient treasure: scrolls from the time of the Empire, which mention the dams!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] almost jumped as the news came, though the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would soon be disappointed. The scrolls do mention an expansion of the Adbrabohvi dam, but they focus on detailing every single honorific title and achievement of the ruling emperor, not on the building itself. Still, the court is excited and the river priests of Adbrabohvi will surely expect a reward…"
 flavor_vels_bacar.7.a:0 "The sacred texts!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.7.b:0 "Bring these old tales to a library, we need actual architects for the dam."

 flavor_vels_bacar.8.t:0 "A Dolindhan Engineer Arrives"
 flavor_vels_bacar.8.d:0 "“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], you were right! The architect came!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the whole guard, expecting a delegation of some sort, yet he was met by a lone Dolindhan in rich robes, a lord… Bostjan?\n\n“Chief Engineer Bradasred, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. I have traveled far with my partners, builders of the most ancient tradition who came out of secrecy as soon as we heard of your blessed call. As they are arriving soon, I have been sent first to secure safe passage for them, and a promise of payment for their work as well as housing during the building effort.\n\nMay we begin the building effort, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?”"
 flavor_vels_bacar.8.a:0 "Please, join us!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.8.b:0 "We’d rather keep the gold housing you would cost…"
 flavor_vels_bacar.8.c:0 "Something is not right… imprison this “engineer”"

 flavor_vels_bacar.9.t:0 "A Northern Party"
 flavor_vels_bacar.9.d:0 "“Disaster!\n\nMy [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], that ‘engineer’ we let into the palace to build the dam was actually a fraud! As soon as his ‘builders’ arrived, he let them in, they ransacked as much as they could, and left into the night. We’ve sent guards out into the countryside to find them, but no luck as of yet. These brigands seem to have entirely disappeared…”"
 flavor_vels_bacar.9.a:0 "WHAT!?"
 
 flavor_vels_bacar.10.t:0 "Caught Red Handed!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.10.d:0 "“Disaster averted\n\nMy [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the decision to imprison that ‘engineer’ was the right call, as it turns out he’s a fraud! Word has come from Bosancovac that he’s a prominent vagabond and charlatan, who has done this sort of thing before. While we did not fall for this scheme of his, others were not so lucky. Let’s allow our new ‘guest’ to enjoy the dungeon a little while…”"
 flavor_vels_bacar.10.a:0 "Oh thank the Ynn!"

 flavor_vels_bacar.11.t:0 "The Masters of the Dams"
 flavor_vels_bacar.11.d:0 "“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Brelari masters of the dams are here!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not leave the Halba Hariez, despite the session being one boring analysis of bridge tolls in Stanyrhrada and whether they follow the law.\n\nAnd there the Brelari masters found [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Their tales were listened to by the whole Panykorun, the members of their group interviewed separately for the details of their journey, and proof of their mastery on dambuilding requested right from the start.\n\nIt all seemed to be right, down to the last comma, even fitting the meager mentions of architectural expertise in the Adbrabohvi scrolls: the ancient knowledge was saved in Brelar, where it survived for centuries as the rest of Ynnic society declined and fell to infighting."
 flavor_vels_bacar.11.a:0 "Finally, we can begin!" 

 flavor_vels_bacar.12.t:0 "The Blue Palace"
 flavor_vels_bacar.12.d:0 "Stantirvare, the ancient seat of Jurion the Honest, the first, most loyal companion of the great Lukaus. Taken by Malacnar in ancient times, it never recovered its importance… until now.\n\nOn the hill next to the city, where it is said Jurion lived, a new building complex of white stone and blue roofs dominates the landscape:\n\nCydohradka, the Blue Palace of the yen Bacar, the scions of Jurion himself through Taranis. A magnificent palace surrounded by functional fortifications, the sparkling blue roofs give the palace its eponymous, mesmerizing appearance, especially when touched by the rays of the sun. The architecture itself  is a blend of Sarda and Dolindhan architecture, with beautifully crafted domes, soaring towers and elegant archways."
 flavor_vels_bacar.12.a:0 "Jurion would be proud."

 flavor_vels_bacar.13.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Vision Comes True"
 flavor_vels_bacar.13.d:0 "“Look, metka, we’re here!”\n\nIstrenya smiled at her daughter, as the family crossed the western gate. The great project of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] had finally come to life, and all those who could had come to its inauguration.\n\nWhat they saw left them in awe.\n\nThe old dam was impressive, ancient, solid and robust, yet the newer dam shone like a jewel under the sun. Built in polished white stone, the widened dam housed great gardens on top of it, covered in the azure panykorun trees that are oh-so-rare away from the city. The old Halba Hariez was now but a part of a larger complex, a parliament worthy of the state it governed with a dome comparable to the one from Stanyrhrada, shining blue under the sky.\nAnd that was only the Hall of Colours, for all along the dam a succession of great works greeted their eyes: a theatre, a temple, a great library, the new headquarters of the Riverblades…"
 flavor_vels_bacar.13.a:0 "The jewel of the Ynn!"

 flavor_vels_bacar.14.t:0 "Dealing with the Leftovers"
 flavor_vels_bacar.14.d:0 "The elves of Trompolere scatter before our Riverblades, their morale collapsed after the death of Alaran at the hands of brave Lord Artoray. Yet, we are not done.\n\nMany of them have gathered in Vels Amsto under one of Alaran's captains, aiming to form a bandit princedom they call Lesnikpansvo. Do not give them a minute of rest!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.14.a:0 "Expel all bandits from this land!"

 flavor_vels_bacar.15.t:0 "A Dolindhan Amongst the Panykorun?"
 flavor_vels_bacar.15.d:0 "The rivalry between Vels Bacar and Arganjuzorn has always made the relations between the two lordships very difficult, not less so now that they are our Iosahar without access to the Panykorun, as they are not Sarda. We now have a unique opportunity, however, in the figure of Avardyl Uma-Zomaj: Brother of the lord of Arganjuzorn and a personal friend of [Root.Monarch.GetName], he has trained in the school of Riverblades and married a yen Bacar cousin, becoming a stalwart supporter of our house.\n\nPerhaps we could place him on the throne of Arganjuzorn and mend an old wound, welcoming the closest of the Dolindha into the Panykorun as well?"
 flavor_vels_bacar.15.a:0 "Rise, Avardyl, lord of Arganjuzorn by the grace of the Ynn!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.15.b:0 "Avardyl is too valuable to be sent away!"

 flavor_vels_bacar.16.t:0 "Krahnorian Envoys Arrive at Vels Bacar"
 flavor_vels_bacar.16.d:0 "They were few at first: a single explorer, an Adrien yen Terhr, then small groups, and after that an unstoppable wave of settlers all across the region. The Adbrabohvi priests denied access to some, the alarmed lord of Arverynn summoned his Veykodan mercenaries when facing others… and yet all [Root.Monarch.GetName] could see was an opportunity.\n\n“The years of diplomacy, intrigue and battle bear their fruits, your majesty. The Krahnorians are here”\n\nThey were dangerous, sure. The Epednar, ever the lords of the Expanse, had been challenged by these Krahnorians, and so were the Veykodans and even the Cursed Ones.\n\nYet they brought such blessings when you knew where to pull and where to give, who to support and who to keep away…\n\n“Send them in, Valdaran. We are ready”\n\nAnd in they came, one after the other: dozens of banners and flags, from small companies to large adventuring states, all had come to the call of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Ynn. They bore many gifts: gunpowder weaponry, Krahnorian-style clothes made of silk, the banner of Vels Bacar represented with Krahnorian motifs and innumerable offers of future services…\n\nAll to gain [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favor, and the goodwill of the Bacarans.\n\nIt was at the end of the banquet that [Root.Monarch.GetName] called for the attention of the Krahnorians and her Iosahars alike, clearing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice:\n\n“Let it be known that I, [Root.Monarch.GetName], with the support of the Panykorun, grant the Krahnorians present here and their associates and colleagues the right to settle in Epadobnn, on the west side of the Holy Ynn next to the capital. They shall elect a representative who may bring any issues to the Panykorun on the third day after the new moon, and every two weeks onwards. All who settle in Epadobnn will be treated as any other subject in the lordship of Vels Bacar, with the same duties and the same rights, and will be subject to the Sarda code of law..”\n\nMany iosahars would be displeased, and even more Krahnorians would be angered at having to follow their laws, but they would follow her will and that of the majority of the Panykorun, for it was the will of all the Ynn."
 flavor_vels_bacar.16.a:0 "So we have spoken, so it will be."

 flavor_vels_bacar.17.t:0 "The Northern Lords Arrive"
 flavor_vels_bacar.17.d:0 "Peasants, artisans, merchants and priests alike massed at the sides of the road leading into Vels Bacar, the main way held open by the two rows of well-equipped soldiers from all across the Ynn. In front of them, the cream of the Dolindhan nobility entered the city, riding their famed antler horses. After them, the Rzentur nobles followed, bearing their faith with pride.\n\nA gathering of such magnitude had not been seen since the proclamation of the Panykorun, which awaited them at the renewed Halba Hariez.\n\nThey all followed the path down the road, where the imposing procession reached the Hall of Colours. There, [Root.Monarch.GetName] waited, wearing a crown of blue panykorun flowers: the eponymous tree of the yen Bacar, present in the many gardens around the building.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] took off his crown, and one by one each of the Dolindhan and Rzentur lords swore upon it the same ancient oath their Sarda counterparts once did: to follow the house yen Bacar and to join them as the Panykorun, where they would all have a voice and a vote under the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nAt last, [Root.Monarch.GetName] picked up the crown, and swore an oath before wearing it.\n\n“I, [Root.Monarch.GetName], swear upon the Ynn to listen to the Panykorun and govern with it, just as it will rule with me…”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] then took a deep breath, and continued\n\n“...until preparations are ready for me to leave this crown and join the Panykorun, as this crown needs no [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for the Ynnic Republic to prosper”"
 flavor_vels_bacar.17.a:0 "The Ynnic Republic?!"

 flavor_vels_bacar.18.t:0 "A Prosperous Land"
 flavor_vels_bacar.18.d:0 "The realm prospers.\n\nUnder the benevolent gaze of the Panykorun, petty disputes are solved with no blood drawn. Away from the borders, the Ynnic peasants work the land in peace, the fear of raids existing only in tales of their parents and grandparents. With the Sarda Code in hand, the administration of the realm works seemingly by itself, keeping the country running. Even Vels Bacar itself, the shining jewel of the Ynn, has taken to electing its own mayor, so the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s time can be dedicated to other matters…\n\nWhat matters?\n\nWhispers spread, first in Vels Bacar itself, and then further away: IIs the lord even necessary when the Panykorun takes charge of the country? Yen Bacar noble loyalists have made their concerns known to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], asking, begging to know why he/she does nothing as the rumors of the Panykorun running the country spread."
 flavor_vels_bacar.18.a:0 "We serve a higher purpose"

 flavor_vels_bacar.19.t:0 "Rise of the Bacaran Republic"
 flavor_vels_bacar.19.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood before the full Panykorun in session, rising from the throne with pride. They were all here: from Amacimst to Grebsnieth, and from Brelar to Adbrabohvi, all the members of the Panykorun were in place. A rare sight indeed, a promising one. They were ready.\n\n“I, [Root.Monarch.GetName], once swore upon the Ynn to listen to the Panykorun and govern with it, just as it would rule with me, until the preparations were ready for me to leave this crown. Until we all, indeed, were ready for it. And I think we are.\n\nUnder the guidance of my noble family, the yen Bacar, this assembly has seen the Ynn unite and modernize, grow and prosper, advance forward and never grow stagnant! The world of old was ruled by imperial tyrants and broken by rebellions and disputes, while the Panykorun guarantees reason, advancements and prosperity so we may never return to such dark times.”\n\nWith this said, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked down to the center of the Hall of Colors and, with one solemn gesture, left the Panykorun crown onto it. An enchanted crystal cover was then placed on top of it, so it would never degrade, and the members of house yen Bacar sat down at their new seats in the Panykorun amongst cheers."
 flavor_vels_bacar.19.a:0 "A Crown without a King!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.19.b:0 "A Crown without a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"

 flavor_vels_bacar.20.t:0 "The yen Stenur Princess Arrives"
 flavor_vels_bacar.20.d:0 "As it was promised, upon the rise to our throne of [Root.Monarch.GetName], princess Ariadra yen Stenur has arrived to Vels Bacar with her honor guard, her pearly tresses shining under the sun.\n\nIt is time."
 flavor_vels_bacar.20.a:0 "Let our houses unite as one."

 flavor_vels_bacar.21.t:0 "Election!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.21.d:0 "The term is up for $MONARCH$.\n\nAs established, the lords of the Panykorun have debated for weeks, and three candidates now rise from the ranks of the Ynnic nobility. Who will lead us?"
 flavor_vels_bacar.21.a:0 "A law-focused candidate is best for the realm"
 flavor_vels_bacar.21.b:0 "A true diplomat is needed to manage the Krahnorians"
 flavor_vels_bacar.21.c:0 "The Panykorun needs a war leader"
 flavor_vels_bacar.21.e:0 "When in doubt, we can always rely on the yen Bacar"

 flavor_vels_bacar.22.t:0 "Election!"
 flavor_vels_bacar.22.d:0 "The unfortunate passing of $MONARCH$ forces us to hold a premature election.\n\nAs established, the lords of the Panykorun have debated for weeks, and three candidates now rise from the ranks of the Ynnic nobility. Who will lead us?"

 flavor_vels_bacar.23.d:0 "At last, the arrogance of Alaran and the greed of his subjects have been put in their place. Let it be known to all that this will be the fate of any would-be warlord: The yen Bacar will stand firm, first of the line, ready to send them the way they came!"

 G84_velsbacar_halbahariez_desc:0 "Now that more and more Sarda lords swear oaths of fealty to us, we must not fall into imperial delusions of grandeur like those of Calrodiy IV or dreams of great conquest like those of the late Alaran yen Cestor.\nEnvoys from all across the Sarda lands will come here to the Hall of Colors, the Halba Hariez, giving our lord the ability to keep direct contact with his oathkeepers.\n\nThe designs are ready: a building of white stone, great stained glass windows will decorate the hall, one after the haircolor of the ruling dynasty of each Sarda lordship. Standing inside, a myriad of colors will marvel the senses of the observer not only because of the beauty of the place, but because they have come to see the place of reunion of all the Sarda.\n\nThe yen Bacar won’t place a yoke on these lands, but lead them to greatness!"

 G84_velsbacar_avengeoursires_title:0 "Avenge Our Sires"
 G84_velsbacar_avengeoursires_desc:0 "Ever since taking control of Arganjuzorn, Vels Bacar has had to deal with the Dolindhan lordships, but none of them are as opposed to our ideals as Malacnar is. A thousand years in the past, Malacnar destroyed the lordship of Stantirvare and the elder line of Jurion the Honest after 160 years of rivalry and war. His line survived in the lands of Vels Bacar, where Taranis, third son of the lord of Stantirvare, founded house yen Bacar.\n\nThough conquered by Vareynn and thus becoming part of the Ynnic Empire of old, the Malacnari never forgot their accursed roots, and reappeared at their first chance to do so, recovering their ancient bloodthirsty traditions. These warmongers would paint the whole Ynn in blood to satisfy their so-called Battlekings, conquering the land like they once did in Stantirvare.\n\nThey must be stopped, and the fall of Stantirvare will finally be avenged!"

Food prices soar, housing is stretched to the limit and the City Guard can hardly manage to keep the discontent populace in control. A courtier by the name of Vyrhendyr Karvyska has come up with a solution, however: to resettle all willing refugees to our lands west of the Ynn in Epadobnn and Minata. It won’t be cheap, and it certainly won’t be easy, but turning these temporary refugees into permanent citizens, taming the grasslands and solving the crisis at the same time would be a most desirable outcome…"

 G84_velsbacar_oldest_desc:0 "The House yen Bacar is the oldest across the whole Ynn: our blood comes from Jurion the Honest himself, the right hand of Lukaus, the legendary antler lord. There is, however, another elder house amongst the Sarda, that of the yen Stenur, who come from the Riverwall Marriage of the Dolindhan lord Calsanqir and the last princess of Amstenur, the great walled city of the ancient Sarda.\n\nBoth our houses were allied not so long ago, and having always considered them friends, having to fight them has not been pleasant.

 G84_velsbacar_azurepeace_title:0 "The Azure Peace"
 G84_velsbacar_azurepeace_desc:0 "West Dolindha is a land much different from our Sarda homelands. The savage Epednar raid the vulnerable population, and there is naught they can do to stop them but attack back with overwhelming force, causing the raids to come back even greater in number - enraged that they were defied.\n\nIt is a vicious cycle that must end. As stewards of West Dolindha, the Panykorun has approved the building of a line of fortifications to keep the Epednar at bay  - not drive them away like wild animals, but break this endless cycle of violence."

Indeed, a group of the well known and the rich amongst the Sarnik have formed a party in support of our transition into a republic, calling themselves Fadhecatlar or “Far Wanderers” Party.\n\nAfter much discussion and in an unexpected turn of events, the Panykorun has decided to give the Fadhecatlar representation and one vote in the Panykorun.\n\nOne wonders how much they spent into this agreement."
 G84_velsbacar_victory_title:0 "Victory at the Dam!"
 G84_velsbacar_victory_desc:0 "At last, victory! The upstart Alaran has been stopped, the bandits of Vels Amsto rooted out of their dens and the lands they took against all traditions of our people have been rescued from the grasp of Trompolere. \n\nAnd yet the balance has been irremediably shattered: Carodin Vyrekynn and the former allies of his father in Stanyrhrada prepare for battle, claiming the lands Calrodiy IV abandoned. Meanwhile, our old iosahar Adbraseloc suffers under the Juzornic yoke as their masters wonder if they can strike us again. Strong and victorious, it is our time to bring them to heel before our enemies coordinate to end the independence of Vels Bacar. There is no time to rest!"
 G84_velsbacar_proclamation_title:0 "Proclamation of Order"
 G84_velsbacar_proclamation_desc:0 "We first assumed that the instability amongst our people would be solved by slaying Alaran and stopping his army, we then hoped that peace would reign after our former rivals became our iosahar, and yet discord and strife extend from our borders all the way to Adbrabohvi. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] council have been gathered in discussions for a whole month and he/she has come to a conclusion: dozens of envoys will be sent all across the Lower Ynn in a region-wide proclamation: be it by word or by sword, the yen Bacar will put an end to the Age of Petty Lords."
 G84_velsbacar_panykorun_title:0 "The Panykorun"
 G84_velsbacar_panykorun_desc:0 "As we advanced in our quest for order amongst the Sarda and lord after lord became our iosahar, many wondered if Vels Bacar would be the next warlord, the next petty lordship. Never!\nThe lord proclaimed order, and order came. It will not last, however, if all we do is rule over disgruntled iosahar kept in place only by fear.\n\nLet all the lords meet us in the Halba Hariez, for a new dawn is coming to the Sarda."
 G84_velsbacar_ynnyrpriests_title:0 "A Seat for Ynnyr Priests"
 G84_velsbacar_ynnyrpriests_desc:0 "The position of the Ynnic priests of Adbrabohvi in the Panykorun is a strange one: not nobles per se, unlike the other members, yet incredibly relevant nonetheless. In this dilemma there is one large opportunity, as having them on our side will no doubt be hugely beneficial.\n\nIn exchange for their blessing on our rule over the Sarda and their support in future debates, let us grant the Adbrabohvi priests a privileged seat in the Panykorun.\n\nThe Ynn watches over us, and we will watch over its children."
 G84_velsbacar_unifiedlaw_title:0 "A Unified Law"
 G84_velsbacar_unifiedlaw_desc:0 "Sometimes, a meeting in the Panykorun can end up more heated than one would like. Sometimes heated arguments break out over the necessity of actions from the state, or debates on our political stance against our neighbours, yet none ever seemed to be as fiercely debated as this matter.\n\nDespite sharing the laws of the Ynnic Empire, the myriad of Sarda lordships have differed widely in their application, changing them freely and making new laws with every generation. It is chaos, harming the development of the region at every turn, and it is the will of our lord that these disparate laws must be unified into one comprehensive code. No matter the cost, no matter the debates.\n\nOne great law to unite the Sarda."
 G84_velsbacar_arganjuzorn_title:0 "The Status of Arganjuzorn"
 G84_velsbacar_arganjuzorn_desc:0 "The rivalry between Vels Bacar and Arganjuzorn has always made the relations between the two lordships very difficult, not less so now that they are our iosahar without access to the Panykorun, for they are not Sarda. We now have a unique opportunity, however, in the figure of Avardyl Uma-Zomaj: Brother of the lord of Arganjuzorn and a friend of our monarch, he has trained in the Riverblade academy of Vels Bacar and become a strong supporter of our house.\nPerhaps we could place him on the throne of Arganjuzorn and mend an old wound, welcoming the closest of the Dolindha into the Panykorun as well?"
 G84_velsbacar_reunited_title:0 "Reunited under the Brothers"
 G84_velsbacar_reunited_desc:0 "Dolindhans, Rzentur, and Sarda. Lords from all over the old empire, gathered under the statues of the Filenval Brothers for a single cause, under the azure roof of the Panykorun. As the Ynn runs through us all, we can finally work together.\nThere will be difficulties, there will come times when we disagree, but they will join us nonetheless."
 G84_velsbacar_trust_title:0 "Gaining the Lords' Trust"
 G84_velsbacar_trust_desc:0 "The streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] are growing quickly in their varieties, even more so after the Krahnorians arrived. No matter where they come from, all visitors eventually come together into a blending of cultures of sorts. One can see halfling food stands, human envoys from faraway kingdoms and even half orc mercenaries who visit the city in between contracts, all in the midst of the shining Ynnic society.\n\nThe lands, too, are in a season of change. Many iosahar lords and ladies petition [Root.Monarch.GetName] for restraints on the Panykorun, for a slowing down of  the fast reforms. But a few soft words - or a healthy amount of gold - assuage most fears."
 G84_velsbacar_crown_title:0 "A Crown without a King"
 G84_velsbacar_crown_desc:0 "The preparations are finally ready, every piece in its place. It is time for the designs of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to come true: for the Ynn does not need a ruling dynasty to prosper: it needs them all, cooperating together for the greater benefit of the Great River and all of its children.\n\nSound the trumpets, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] summons the Panykorun!"
 G84_velsbacar_rivals_title:0 "Our Perennial Rivals"
 G84_velsbacar_rivals_desc:0 "For 300 years have the lords of the line of Jurion the Wise held the dam against the armies of Arganjuzorn, ever since the Revenant Battalion returned from the Epednar expanse to support the imperial pretender Jearcad, who then besieged Vels Bacar.\nWe were then saved by lord Adrjon Orderbringer of Stanyrhada, forging our eternal friendship, but the Revenant Battalion stayed in Arganjuzorn to further torment us. The back and forth has continued ever since, fighting over the key Adbraseloc way, and thus the father of Lord Artoray lost our northern iosahar to the Dolindhans.\n\nNow that we are to advance south and end the strife, we cannot do so with our backs exposed. Let us bring Arganjuzorn down. once and for all, and make them swear an oath of loyalty to their rightful lords!"
 G84_velsbacar_newest_title:0 "The Newest of the Conquerors"
 G84_velsbacar_newest_desc:0 "The young lord of Trompolere thought himself unbeatable, a hero of legend, when he was nothing more than the last of a long line of petty conquerors of the Dark Ages of the Ynn. Now that Alaran and his lust for undeserved glory are nothing but dust, we can go forth and put Trompolere in its place, confining them to their righteous lands and nothing else. Justice, at last."
 G84_velsbacar_knowledge_title:0 "A Call for Knowledge"
 G84_velsbacar_knowledge_desc:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Vels Bacar has a dream: an expansion of the Bacaran dam, making it a new district of the city itself with monuments, marvels, a garden with blue Panykorun trees: the proper heart of the Ynn, at the heart of Vels Bacar itself.\nThis dream, however, requires techniques lost to the ages, as we know how to maintain the dams but not how the ancient masters of the Yrisar built them. Let us make a call for knowledge across the Ynn, so all those who may have a glimpse of this ancient knowledge come to us."
 G84_velsbacar_expandingthedam_title:0 "Expanding the Dam"
 G84_velsbacar_expandingthedam_desc:0 "With the help of the masters of the dams, the building project can finally take place. Dozens of architects, thousands of laborers from all across the Ynn and the masters themselves are ready, with large shipments of stone being sent downriver already.\n\nAll they need is funding, and an order to begin."
 G84_velsbacar_peace_title:0 "The Peace of the Lords"
 G84_velsbacar_peace_desc:0 "All across the Ynn, people prosper, the realm is stable and the might of the city of Vels Bacar shines above all others.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the city marvel at the renowned dam and its beauty, but for the politically minded individuals, there is one thing they notice above anything else:\n\nWho truly rules here?"
 G84_velsbacar_center_title:0 "The Center of the Ynn"
 G84_velsbacar_center_desc:0 "Vels Bacar has not just grown in size, nor just grown in population, but it has grown in relevance. Every day, new merchants travel the roads just to come to our marketplaces. New engineers inspect our dams, and new priests journey to our temples. Vels Bacar has become like one of the Ynnic capitals of old, a gleaming gem that none will miss on their journeys across our lands.\n\nThis growth as the new shining capital of the Ynn has brought a demand for books like never before, as a Krahnorian-style administration consumes paper like a starving wendigo. A growing paper industry has come to dominate a significant portion of the Bacaran workforce, and far from discouraging it, we welcome it! Let us feed our administration well, for the effort it puts into the growth of this realm!"
 G84_velsbacar_soldiersrest_title:0 "A Soldier's Rest"
 G84_velsbacar_soldiersrest_desc:0 "Many of the brave elves who fought in the war against the upstart Alaran were proven veterans: some who fought and lost against the Juzornic armies, serving under lord Artoray’s father, and even earlier on. Those very soldiers and many other veterans from our recent campaigns have bled for our city, and many amongst the populace claim for proper compensation for their loyal efforts.\n\nLet no one say that the yen Bacar are not grateful: our veterans and their families will be given lands in the plains west of the Dam, where they shall grow and prosper. "
 G84_velsbacar_southofthedam_title:0 "Our Lands in the south"
 G84_velsbacar_southofthedam_desc:0 "Our newly liberated lands to the south have suffered greatly: borderlands during the Age of Petty Lords, they were then pillaged by Alaran’s armies and sacked again by the bandits of Lesnikpansvo. Now that they are finally in good hands, we must do our best to heal the devastation of the land: we will heal these territories, starting with the places of worship that were ruined during the war."
 G84_velsbacar_fruitsofpeace_title:0 "The Fruits of Peace"
 G84_velsbacar_fruitsofpeace_desc:0 "With the Sarda lands free of petty brother wars, the Lower Ynn can finally prosper. Lands long starved see growth, and the great number of soldiers who died in our wars for order are now, finally, seeing their place taken by new, faithful warriors.\n\nThere is still much to heal, much to grow, but this is a promising start."
 G84_velsbacar_tempest_title:0 "Calm after the Tempest"
 G84_velsbacar_tempest_desc:0 "Dolindha has long been a land of violence, and however much we dislike it, much of the blame falls to us. First our eternal fights with Arganjuzorn, and now our wars with the Dolindha and Rzentur lords. We have brought our enemies to heel, subjugated our rivals…\n\n…But have we shown them the same peace we brought to the Sarda? Our great dam is now more glorious than ever before, the Lower Ynn a jewel, but have we helped them heal?\n\nLet us make a lasting peace, so us all may recover and new riches are allowed to flow up and down our sacred river."
