 G58_agronomers_association_reform:0 "Agronomer's Association"
 G58_agronomers_association_reform_desc:0 "The Keyolíoni Agronomer’s Association is a prestigious organisation for transmutation mages known throughout Kheionai. It started as a government-run initiative for researching high-altitude sugar cane cultivation, but as its influence grew, the administrative power shifted over to the academic staff. \n\nThe close cooperation between the wealthy plantation owners and the Association allowed for rapid research and development of new strains of sugar cane and offered the students practical experience in the greenhouse laboratories. For many skilled mages, a career in the Association was a quick path to being hired as a private subcontractor on one of the many plantations in the country. For others, it was a steady climb towards the top of the academic ladder - a seat of 24 Council Agronomers, headed by the Grand Agronomer, whose influence in the country was second only to the Kylakas. (At least on paper, as most of the influence was held by the oligarchic elite.) \n\nWhile the main headquarters building is situated in the city of Keyolíon, the Association has branches in every settlement. It issues licences to plantation owners and inspects the crops regularly to ensure compliance with the Association’s standards."

 keyolion_events.2.t: "Sugar Cane Scions"
 keyolion_events.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] felt the burden of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] recent election as the leader of Keyolíon. Lately, to ease [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own mind, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] found comfort in silent walks along the shore of the city-state. Today, one worry troubled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis]. It was the story of how their kheion had come to be, a tale passed from generation to generation: \n\n‘Our mother city - Oktikheion, nestled among the hills of Alecand, lacked the spaciousness of the other Kheions. Most of its people lived near the coast, where our ancestors had built the kaydhano wards. Quickly, Oktikheion grew too dense for comfort. When we heard of the new lands that the other Kheions had found across the sea, free from the deathly winds, we decided to follow suit. We were not the first to arrive, but we were lucky to find a safe haven that we could call our own.’ \n\nOn Devand, they found themselves in a similar predicament. The Hsamazh mountains stretched like a spine across the land, almost reaching the cape of Poroga, hindering their expansion inland. Keyolíon, much like its mother kheion, would grow too dense for its confines and when that happened, the state would have to be ready. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s proposal and the reason for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] election was [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] initiative to improve the land outside of the kheion. Already a new settlement on the coast was being worked on. \n\nBut this was where their problems began. The Keyolíoni had inherited one thing from their mother kheion - the expertise to grow great sugar cane - something which the mountains were ill suited for. The coasts around them were already claimed. Once they were fully settled and cultivated, where would they go?"
 keyolion_events.2.a: "Only time will tell."

 keyolion_events.3.t: "Harvest Failure"
 keyolion_events.3.d: "A sudden frost has ravaged the sugar cane fields of [From.GetName]. The cold front swept in from the south, bringing freezing temperatures that lasted for a week. In a dire attempt to save their harvests, the plantation owners employed evocation mages from the capital and the neighbouring kheion, but the elements prevailed. The once verdant and thriving crops have been reduced to a wasteland of frozen and withered stalks, with the frost penetrating deep into the soil, killing the roots and preventing any chance of regrowth. \n\nMany citizens have now started asking where they can grow the sugar cane that they’ve become so dependent on for their livelihood."
 keyolion_events.3.a: "We have to find a solution."

 keyolion_events.4.t: "The Northern Port"
 keyolion_events.4.d: "We had heard of a river that divided the drylands, but our sailors’ reports exceeded all our expectations. Arable land, rich and green, as far as the eye can see, much like our kheion. A settlement there would make the logistics of transporting large quantities of sand to Poroga easier and cheaper. Our government has since been working hard securing our claim to the province."
 keyolion_events.4.a: "It shall be ours."

 keyolion_events.5.t: "Experiments In The Mountainside"
 keyolion_events.5.d: "While most of the staff of the institute are focused on maintaining existing plantations, a select few ambitious transmutators are occupied with a different sort of work. They work tirelessly in their magical greenhouses, trying different methods and spells in an attempt to adapt sugar cane to the cold weather of the mountains, until a few weeks ago, when a young academic shook the kheion with her findings. Her discovery has been verified by her peers and hailed as a major achievement. Through an innovative technique, she has managed to infuse the sugar cane seeds in such a way that they can survive and grow in a harsher climate. There is a tradeoff - the modified sugar cane grows slower and requires magical supervision. The academic is confident that it will be possible to build upon the approach and possibly even make a plant that would thrive in the cold… should her faculty receive the required funding. \n\nUnder the institute’s decree several plantations in Initheíon have been restored and the experimental seeds sown."
 keyolion_events.5.a: "Today we have made history."

 keyolion_events.6.t: "The Breakthrough"
 keyolion_events.6.d: "Just over a year ago, a student from the institute stumbled upon a remarkable sight while conducting a survey of the highest settlement in the country. On a nearby peak was a field of white flowers covering the whole area. The flower is native to the Hsamazh mountain but is usually sparse and scattered. Near the edge of the peak was a solitary gravestone. Sat next to it was an elf - older and with grey hair. He greeted the student and opened up about how he had grown up in a settlement further down the mountainside, how he’d fallen in love with a Mteibhar woman, how they had enjoyed watching the sunrise from the mountain peaks. Ever since her premature passing, he had lived next to her grave on her favourite peak and had maintained a field of that particular flower, one that symbolises dedication to a loved one in Mteibhar culture. \n\nA few weeks later a group from the institute returned, offering him large amounts of food, clothes, coins, anything he could wish for, if he would come with them to the capital. The elf obliged, without asking for anything in return. He was found out to be a potent transmuter and his technique trumped even the most capable mages in the institute. Within the past year, his methods have been adopted by the academic staff. Through rigorous research of his technique, a new sort of sugar cane is close to fruition; one that could resist even colder weather. \n\nThe elf was offered a prestigious position at the institute, but that was turned down. One day, without any notice, he left once more for Hsamazh."
 keyolion_events.6.a: "Thank you, wise elf of the mountain!"

 keyolion_events.7.t: "Perfecting The Sort"
 keyolion_events.7.d: "For the Keyolíoni, sugar cane is more than a crop. It is a passion, a legacy, a destiny - one that has pushed countless citizens to devote their lives in the pursuit of perfection. Sugar is a canvas without any expectations for the artist. People of all backgrounds were drawn to that canvas - from erudite scholars and mages to humble peasants. Harnessing knowledge from their ancestors and their own experiments, they managed to combine magic, technology, and creativity to overcome the limitations of nature. But most important of all, they had made sugar cane their pride and joy.\n\nToday, they have reached the pinnacle of their craft. A new generation of seeds has been distributed to every plantation in the country. Seeds that carry the essence of their collective wisdom and skill. Seeds that can withstand any climate and condition. Seeds that will produce the finest sugar cane ever known to elvenkind."
 keyolion_events.7.a: "There are no limits for our transmutators."

 keyolion_events.8.t: "Overlord Intervenes"
 keyolion_events.8.d: "Most troubling news reached our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] - an Oktikheioni ship docked in port today. Along with the usual tax collectors that demanded the fees we owed to our mother Kheion, a small group of diplomats disembarked and headed straight for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s consulate. They notified the administration of the new tariffs that were being imposed as a result of the newly established slave trade deal. After a brief explanation of how this deal was affecting their own trade interests, they left, making it evident that there would be no negotiations. A couple of days later, a merchant discovered that Empkeios, our trading partner, had also suffered from the same fate. The two Kheions must have conspired to suppress this endeavour. \n\nNumerous plantation owners have already voiced their dissatisfaction and the more daring ones are organising protests. Amidst this political turmoil an intriguing idea has crossed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s mind. With the oligarchs riled up against the overlords, they would be easily influenced to rebel. So long as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could find allies, Keyolíon could taste freedom. There are two main interested parties - Empkeios and the other Kheionai. If the two Nékheis, supported by an Alecandi, declared independence, they would surely overpower the greedy overlords."
 keyolion_events.8.a: "Their greed will not go unpunished."

 keyolion_events.9.t: "The Empkeios' Response"
 keyolion_events.9.d: "The delegation that we had sent to Empkeios has returned. Their response:"
 keyolion_events.9.a: "Yes! No longer shall the Alecandi control our lives."
 keyolion_events.9.b: "No! No matter, we will fight for our freedom alone."

 keyolion_events.10.t: "The Trilidir Library"
 keyolion_events.10.d: "Nestled within the heart of Eneion, the Trilidir library stands as a treasure trove of knowledge. While it is a relatively recent project, the Eneioni scholars have done an exceptional job documenting the Devandi settlers and the natives alike. It serves as a humble reminder of the similarities between us and them, of our culture and theirs. Along with it comes a wealth of knowledge on their languages. When a Kheionai citizen dedicates some time in the library, they leave a better person.\n\nNow that we’ve gained ownership over the library, we are faced with a choice. We can leave the knowledge gathered by the Eneioni where it is. They are the custodians that have collected it - they will take the best care as well. Maybe our elite can learn something by spending some time there.\n\nOr, we can take the knowledge for ourselves and bring it into Keyolíon for our own libraries. Surely our scholars will make better use of the knowledge base and direct the wisdom in the interest of our state."
 keyolion_events.10.a: "We should visit it occasionally."
 keyolion_events.10.b: "We should take the books for our own scholars."

 keyolion_events.11.t: "The Southern Focus"
 keyolion_events.11.d: "Our recent conquests to the south have opened up new opportunities for different enterprises in the region:\n\nAmgremós is a port surrounded by lush forests, the amount of which remains unseen around other Nékheis. We can utilise that and make Amgremós a hub for our future sprawling fleet.\n\nApikhoxí, situated on the Xiktheam estuary, is in a prime spot for an expanded farming initiative. The lands around it are the most fertile we have seen in the entire Devand. Our people will never suffer from hunger again."
 keyolion_events.11.a: "Invest in Amgremos."
 keyolion_events.11.b: "Invest in Apikhoxi."

 keyolion_events.12.t: "The Delegation to Empkeios"
 keyolion_events.12.d: "On Devand reasons for conflict are endless. Sheltered from the deadly winds, both the Alecandi and the Nékheis scramble to control as much land as possible before it gets claimed by someone else. But in this race, we met an ally with similar interests as us. What started as a trade deal to strengthen both our standings ended up in a kinship that continues to last through generations. Recently, it has become evident that we have taken the lead in this relationship - our capable administrators, gregarious diplomats and excellent soldiers, as well as our achievements, have influenced the Empkeiosi. \n\nTogether, we fought for our freedom. Together, we faced the rest of the Nékheis. Together we will face the rest of our enemies. Except from now on, we will do so united as one."
 keyolion_events.12.a: "One Nekhei to rule them all."

 keyolion_events.13.t: "The Delegation Returns"
 keyolion_events.13.d: "The diplomats we’ve sent to discuss the unification of our two kheions have returned. The Empkeiosi have displayed strong dissatisfaction with our request. We have invested a lot into their development giving a certain validity to our claim for their subjugation.\n\nIf they do not want to unite peacefully, we will do it by force."
 keyolion_events.13.a: "We will make them join us one way or another."

 keyolion_events.14.t: "The Unification Movement"
 keyolion_events.14.d: "We have shared a long and intertwined history with our northern brethren, a history of trade, alliance, brotherly sacrifice and enduring friendship, forming an unbreakable bond between our people. Now, ten years after we sent the delegation to our northern brethren, they welcome this union even more warmly than us.\n\nWith a joyful spirit, the Empkeiosi common folk eagerly await the day when they will unite with us under the guiding light of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Their population no longer answers to their leaders, but to ours. This momentous occasion holds the promise of mutual growth and prosperity as we move away from being Keyolíoni and Empkeiosi and pursue our common destiny as one - as Theinos."
 keyolion_events.14.a: "Our people shall be united at last."

#Events with 1xx are events that apply to Empkeios
 keyolion_events.101.t: "Overlord Intervenes" 
 keyolion_events.101.d: "How Arpedifer - Empkeios' overlord has intervened in the Slave Trade deal between Keyolíon and Empkeios by applying some tariffs."
 keyolion_events.101.a: "Bad."

 keyolion_events.102.t: "The Slave Trade"
 keyolion_events.102.d: "How Keyolíon has approached Empkeios with a proposition that benefits both countries. Empkeios will provide Keyolíon with a steady supply of slaves for their plantations. Keyolíon will then export the sugar to the Kheions and split some of the profit with Empkeios."
 keyolion_events.102.a: "Good."

 keyolion_events.103.t: "The Independence Plot"
 keyolion_events.103.d: "How Keyolíon has approached Empkeios with an offer of co-operation. The two countries will declare independence together against their overlords."
 keyolion_events.103.a: "Unity makes strength."
 keyolion_events.103.b: "We will fight alone."

 keyolion_events.104.t: "Delegation From Keyolíon"
 keyolion_events.104.d: "How Keyolíon has conquered all of the other Nekheis. They're now approaching us asking for our subjugation. They believe they are the rightful rulers of Devand. Refusing will probably make them try to achieve their goals militarily."
 keyolion_events.104.a: "Under them we will be protected."
 keyolion_events.104.b: "Axierophon taught us better."

 keyolion_events.201.t: "Independence War - Victorious"
 keyolion_events.201.d: "A glorious chapter in our nation’s history has been written - the climax of our struggle for freedom. We have fought and broken the chains of tyranny that once bound us, and we stand triumphant. It was a gruelling campaign. Many lost their lives, leaving families grieving, waiting and praying as their fellow countrymen picked up arms to protect their rights. News of strategic victories and pivotal turning points lifted their spirits, igniting a glimmer of hope within their hearts. Stories were told of courage, war heroes, the heroic deeds of Keyolíoni soldiers and their unwavering determination to protect their homeland. \n\nThe Keyolíoni citizens rejoiced as they witnessed their beloved fathers, husbands and sons return from the battlefields - victorious. "
 keyolion_events.201.a: "Our future is bright."

 keyolion_events.202.t: "Independence War - Defeated"
 keyolion_events.202.d: "A harrowing chapter in our nation’s history has been written - the climax of our struggle for freedom. We were crushed, having fought and succumbed to the shackles of tyranny that had always suffocated us. It was a brutal campaign. Many lost their lives, leaving families grieving, waiting and praying as their fellow countrymen picked up arms to protect their rights. News of pyrrhic battles and lost land filled them with despair, for hope of victory seemed to fade with each fight. But the soldiers’ patriotic spirit was not enough to overcome the overwhelming difference between the two armies. \n\nThe Keyolíoni citizens wept as they witnessed what was left of their beloved fathers, husbands and sons returning from the battlefields - defeated."
 keyolion_events.202.a: "Dark times are ahead of us."

 keyolion_events.300.t: "Overlord Intervenes"

 keyolion_events.301.t: "Overlords Intervene"
 keyolion_events.301.d: "Most troubling news reached our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] - an Oktikheioni ship docked in port today. Along with the usual tax collectors that demanded the fees we owed to our mother Kheion, a small group of diplomats disembarked and headed straight for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s consulate. They notified the administration of the new tariffs that were being imposed as a result of the newly established slave trade deal. After a brief explanation of how this deal was affecting their own trade interests, they left, making it evident that there would be no negotiations. \n\nNumerous plantation owners have already voiced their dissatisfaction and the more daring ones are organising protests. Amidst this political turmoil an intriguing idea has crossed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s mind. With the oligarchs riled up against the overlords, they would be easily influenced to rebel. So long as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could find allies, Keyolíon could taste freedom. There are two main interested parties - Empkeios and the other Kheionai. If the two Nékheis, supported by an Alecandi, declared independence, they would surely overpower the greedy overlords."
 keyolion_events.301.a: "Their greed will not go unpunished."

 keyolion_events.302.t: "Opportunistic Nekheis"
 keyolion_events.302.d: "Words reach us that our subject, Keyolion, has entered into an agreement with Empkeios in which the latter supplies slaves to staff Keyolioni plantations. While on paper it seems beneficial for everyone, the reality is different. The Keyolioni have carefully designed the contract such that Empkeios receives a share of the produced trade, cutting on costs by subtracting from profits and sharing the wealth between the two Nekheis, essentially bypassing taxation. This has resulted in sugarcane tariff decrease over the last three years. This is in clear violation of our rights as their overlord. \n\nAs early as next week we can send a messenger declaring our new legislature, heavily sanctioning this behavior and establishing transparent laws that protect our trading interests."
 keyolion_events.302.a: "We must intervene"
 keyolion_events.302.b: "We will let them be"

#Mission titles and descriptions
 G58_1_1_the_new_plantations_title: "The New Plantations"
 G58_1_1_the_new_plantations_desc: "We left our mother Kheion with nothing but our most precious belongings: a handful of sugar cane seeds and the skills to produce the finest harvest. We planted them in the fertile soil around the kheion, and watched them grow into lush fields of sweetness. But our cities are expanding, and our arable lands are shrinking. We must find new plantations to call our own and prepare them for the sowing that’s to come."
 G58_1_2_fund_magical_research_title: "Fund Magical Research"
 G58_1_2_fund_magical_research_desc: "Sugar cane demands warm weather and steady irrigation to grow and thrive. The rivers flowing from the Hsamazh mountain range are abundant, but the climate is harsh and unpredictable. If we are to continue expanding our sugar cane plantations, we will need to adapt. Fortunately, years of experience have given the  edge to our transmutators. Perhaps with an increase of funding, some of them might discover ways to grow sugar cane in more unconventional places."
 G58_1_3_organize_the_agronomers_title: "Organize the Agronomers"
 G58_1_3_organize_the_agronomers_desc: "The first practitioners of magic in Keyolíon were regular citizens and landowners. Mages who were well-versed in transmutation would tend to their own plantations and enhance the crops, resulting in the highest profits of all the land owners. The most renowned would return to the kheion, where they would practise their magic, research new ways of cultivation and teach the population… for a price. While these mages play a significant part in production advancements, they have always been limited by their scale of operations. We have already hired a few, but to successfully tackle the sugar cane issue we must organise these individuals and establish the agronomer’s association."
 G58_1_4_the_sugar_port_title: "The Sugar Port"
 G58_1_4_the_sugar_port_desc: "Keyolíon’s first and only export for a long while was sugar. Even now, many years after its founding, sugar remains the dominant export, largely due to how profitable the plantations are and the successful administrative manoeuvring of our  government. In order to support all of this production, the capital requires investments in its infrastructure - workshops to process the sugar, marketplaces to sell it and docks and shipyards to transport it to its location."
 G58_1_5_the_sugar_must_flow_title: "The Sugar Must Flow"
 G58_1_5_the_sugar_must_flow_desc: "We have built not only our identity, but also our wealth around this sweet crop. However, we are not alone in this endeavour as other nations have seen our success and tried to imitate us. Their quality and quantity are  no match for ours yet they have still managed to divert some of the traders’ attention away from us. If we are to entertain the ambition of dominating the sugar trade, we need to own every single plantation on Devand."
 G58_1_6_mastering_the_craft_title: "Mastering the Craft"
 G58_1_6_mastering_the_craft_desc: "We came to this land with a vision: to make sugar our destiny. We started small - growing humble crops in family farms that turned into vast estates, fueled by slave labour from Empkeios. We faced challenges - cold weather, limited land and political isolation, but we overcame them, with magic, innovation and cooperation. We have learned to grow sugar in any condition, in any place. We have made sugar our art, our science, our pride. We will not stop until we are the undisputed masters of sugar."
 G58_2_1_collect_a_sample_title: "Collect a Sample"
 G58_2_1_collect_a_sample_desc: "When the first settlers of Poroga discovered its vast, empty fields, ideal for sugar cane plantations, they also noticed the occasional heaps of fine sand, blown by the northern winds from the drylands. Lacking all of the malicious properties of  the deathly Kaydhano winds, the sand soon found use in a blooming glass craftsmanship. Our trade partners are eager to buy more of our affordable glass products and we have already arranged some of the local artisans’ cooperation in this venture. All they are asking for is for some materials to study, straight from the source."
 G58_2_2_the_arpedifer_technique_title: "The Arpedifer Technique"
 G58_2_2_the_arpedifer_technique_desc: "The origin of glassblowing on Devand can be traced back to immigrants from Arpedifér, a city famous for its Potidhano, or Death Glass. This glass is highly prized in Kheionai for its quality, beauty and scarcity, with the secrets of the craft passed down only within the artisan families. The descendants of the immigrants in Poroga have long since forgotten these ancestral skills, so if we want to master the art of glassmaking, we need to learn the secrets of the Arpedifér technique, even if it requires some unorthodox methods."
 G58_2_3_ramp_up_production_title: "Ramp Up Production"
 G58_2_3_ramp_up_production_desc: "Thanks to the new technique acquired from Arpedifér, our glass products have become very popular among the Alecandi. New technological discoveries have also made it possible for a more rapid processing of the materials into the finished goods. If we invest a little into this infrastructure, Poroga can become a booming hub for glass artisans and traders alike. "
 G58_2_4_the_institute_of_agronomy_title: "The Institute of Agronomy"
 G58_2_4_the_institute_of_agronomy_desc: "Soon after the agronomer’s association’s formation, most of the sugar cane production in the capital was brought under the oversight of the mages, greatly boosting profits. Its influence gradually extended outwards into the other settlements until no plantation would be legally operational without an official licence from the association. The capital branch, recently refurbished in a novel, lavishly decorated Keyolíoni style, would open its doors, not only as an administrative centre, but also as an institute dedicated to educating the new generation of mages."
 G58_2_5_greenhouse_laboratories_title: "Greenhouse Laboratories"
 G58_2_5_greenhouse_laboratories_desc: "While Keyolíon remains the centre of the agronomic institute, its branches are spreading throughout the country like wildfire. The newfound abundance of high-quality glass has made the equipment necessary to perform experiments on the sugar cane quite affordable. Nowadays, every plantation houses its own greenhouse laboratory. Most have at least a single alumni from the institute advising the owners about recent developments in sugar production, while the largest ones have their own mages supervising the estate."
 G58_3_2_find_a_supporter_title: "Find a Supporter"
 G58_3_2_find_a_supporter_desc: "Years spent in Devand have distanced us from our cousins and overlords. Their recent intrusion on our trading rights has been the last straw. If we were to voice our discontent against Oktikheion, some of the other Alecandi might support our independence initiative, provided we are on good terms."
 G58_3_3_the_dhanam_port_title: "The Dhanam Port"
 G58_3_3_the_dhanam_port_desc: "The Dhanam delta plays a strategic role in our plans. The drylands offer little opportunity for larger settlements to support the extraction and shipment of sand towards Poroga. Owning Dhanam would alleviate this issue and allow us to build a new kheion - a hub for our operation. The delta, however, has also caught the attention of the other Kheions."
 G58_3_4_secure_raw_materials_title: "Secure Raw Materials"
 G58_3_4_secure_raw_materials_desc: "With Dhanam in our hands and with a thriving new production facility in Poroga, our artisans are eagerly waiting for the raw goods to begin production. The plan is simple: dig up some sand from a new settlement, cart it off to Dhanam, and load it onto a ship sailing to Poroga’s glassblowers."
 G58_3_5_the_twin_capital_title: "The Twin Capital"
 G58_3_5_the_twin_capital_desc: "Modern city planning expects its citizens to cluster together. The same does not hold for traditional Keyolíoni. Visitors to the capital or Poroga will discover that they stretch for many kilometres across the coast, so much in fact, that one would expect them to be a single continuous city. While that is not yet the case, our government has seen the value in extending our administrative capabilities into the vital city of Poroga, for the inevitable moment in the distant future when the two cities merge into one."
 G58_3_6_coastal_utopia_title: "Coastal Utopia"
 G58_3_6_coastal_utopia_desc: "Our country has survived many hardships, and even though we had to expand inland out of strategic interests, our hearts always longed for the coast. This desire of ours was quickly adopted by the other Nékheis as it served a common interest. Under our guidance and standardised building requirements, we transformed their bland cities into multi-story, modern urban centres. These new style buildings made of brick and adorned generously with glass windows bring an influx of visitors from Alecand, marvelling at our glorious architecture. Our lands are prosperous and secure for generations to come as people enjoy the luxury of our coastal utopia."
 G58_4_1_the_slave_trade_title: "The Slave Trade"
 G58_4_1_the_slave_trade_desc: "The Kheion of Empkeios is the largest slave market in Devand. We should establish closer ties with their leaders and strike a profitable deal for both our countries. After each raid, they will grant us the privilege of choosing the best of the captured barbarians to serve in our plantations. In return, we will share some of the profits of the lucrative sugar trade."
 G58_4_2_independence_plot_title: "Independence Plot"
 G58_4_2_independence_plot_desc: "The intervention of our mother Kheion in our private business decisions caused our traders noticeable disruption to their work. Two can play that game. Our business partners from Empkeios have also suffered the same fate. We should send a diplomatic delegation to them, with the proposal of a joint plot. We will combine forces to fend off our overlords and protect our interests. No longer will the distant overlords be able to dictate our lives."
 G58_4_3_gain_our_freedom_title: "Gain Our Freedom"
 G58_4_3_gain_our_freedom_desc: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knew that achieving the vision of a sovereign Keyolíon can be accomplished only through a bold and daring move. Many Keyolíoni will give their lives, but in the face of tyranny, their resolve will only grow stronger. This battle will be a testament to the elven spirit… The time for independence has come!"
 G58_4_4_the_northern_brethren_title: "The Northern Brethren"
 G58_4_4_the_northern_brethren_desc: "Amidst the crisis, we formed a kinship with people that share our vision. In the years to come, this newfound friendship will benefit both our countries as we strive to recover and prosper. We must use this period of peace to establish closer connections with our brethren. Let the slave trade flourish once more!"
 G58_4_5_build_up_the_north_title: "Build Up the North"
 G58_4_5_build_up_the_north_desc: "The kheions that we’ve built on Devand lack the rich history our mother cities have on Alecand. As such, they tend to be a little underdeveloped. The Eneioni are hardworking, while the Besolakí are resourceful, meaning we can put their strengths to work and mould their kheions in our image."
 G58_5_1_the_keyolioni_militia_title: "The Keyolíoni Militia"
 G58_5_1_the_keyolioni_militia_desc: "We have mostly avoided conflict with the natives, as long as they vacated the vicinity of our new settlements. Recently, however, the natives have become more aggressive, perhaps as a result of the increased colonisation of their previous homelands throughout Devand. This has alarmed some of our rural population. We should train and arm them, to give them a better chance at protecting themselves against any wandering barbarians."
 G58_5_2_soldiers_by_law_title: "Soldiers by Law"
 G58_5_2_soldiers_by_law_desc: "We had underestimated how politically secluded we truly are. Eneion - our southern neighbours are always looking to expand, the Alecandi cling to their lands in Devand and even covet our own. In the past years it has become a tradition to educate children in self-defence. We will build upon these skills - every citizen fit to fight will be given a martial education. By law, we will require them to serve in the army so that they may protect the country if war breaks out."
 G58_5_3_the_southern_threats_title: "The Southern Threats"
 G58_5_3_the_southern_threats_desc: "Eneion, our southern neighbour, holds on to ambitions of old. They cite that their arrival on Devand, being the first among the Nékheis, gives them claim to rule over the rest of the new cities. Further south lies Besolakí, a city home to exiles from Lokemeion. Left untouched, it is unclear if their radical ideas might grow in a more militarised direction. If we are to ever find peace in these lands, we must confront both the cities."
 G58_5_4_unite_the_nekheis_title: "Unite the Nekheis"
 G58_5_4_unite_the_nekheis_desc: "Since our founding, the Keyolíoni citizens have lived with doubt about our sovereignity in Devand. After our independence and recent conquests, these fears have dissipated and been replaced with a different question. The Kheions have made efforts to unify Alecand under themselves and their ambitions have extended to Devand. They should stick to Alecand, though, for Devand belongs to the Nékheis and whether diplomatically or militarily, we should unite it to protect what is ours."
 G58_5_5_build_up_the_south_title: "Build Up the South"
 G58_5_5_build_up_the_south_desc: "The lands to the south are rich with potential. Having unified all of the Nékheis, we’ve acquired a large workforce, which could be used to advance the development of these coastal centres. Our architects have gained experience from the northern cities and are ready to set solid standards for what a Devandi kheion should look like."
