We have managed to crush the resistance of several kingdoms and have gained a foothold in Bulwar.\n\nHowever, now we face a new problem: a strange cult is growing in popularity among our orcs — a cult of Forgiveness, based on local Bulwari beliefs in Surakel. Many tribesmen claim that we were called here not by the will of Dookan, but by Surakel, who begged orcs to liberate His human children from elven lies and gnollish chains. These cultists claim that although we creatures were born from the Darkness, by freeing the Bulwari people and fulfilling the will of Surakel, we can gain forgiveness in His eyes and be accepted among His children.\n\nPriests of this cult now demand our $MONARCHTITLE$ found the city of Karashar, the city of the Black Sun, from where we will be able to rule Bulwar as 'Surakel wants'."

 orcform.3.d:0 "The invitation arrived at the old Ziggurat in Azka-Sur just as the sun was setting, words written in a shakey hand, but with a clear message: a delegation of priests was requested by the orcs who had recently spilled into Bulwar. The purpose could not quite be made out, but the repeated promises of safety ameliorated the priesthood's worries. And so a handful of junior priests departed, riding some of the Kingdom's least-valuable horses.\n\nAs the emissaries approached, at roughly Noon, they saw a field of silver and black waiting outside [Root.Capital.GetName] — thousands upon thousands of Black Orcs, armor-clad, arrayed around a small hill. The priests looked askance at one another, but none wanted to be the first to suggest cowardice, and so they slowly nudged their steeds towards this convocation.\n\nThe envoys neared, having to force their mounts along — especially when the orcs started to beat their weapons against one another, and parted ranks to let them through. Each polished blade flickered, illuminated in the high Noon sun. Swallowing their fear and their bewilderment, the delegation continued through the throng, towards the figure at its center.\n\nThat figure: a tall orc, skin as black as night, a sharp contrast to the golden crown gleaming in his hands. He gestures the delegation to stop, and its leader dismounts. The orc briefly closes his eyes, nods. He steps forward, places the crown in the Dartaxi priest's hands, and kneels before him. The noise all around suddenly ceases, the land goes quiet, all Bulwar seeming to hold its breath.\n\nThat priest has been in his position only a few years, in the priesthood less than a decade. What could he say? What could he do, aside from the obvious? And so with trembling hands he places the crown on the chieftain's head. A moment passes, two. And then the orc rises, the silence is broken. Every orc chants a single world: "Karakal! Karakal! Karakal!""

 jazhkredu_nation_desc:0 "Us goblins have been beat around enough! We've fought tooth and shiv against orcs, dwarves, humans, and everyone else to claw a place we can call our own. Now it's time for us to take our hard earned wins and build something no goblin has had - home. Today we declare a paradise for goblins by goblins, Jazhkredu."
