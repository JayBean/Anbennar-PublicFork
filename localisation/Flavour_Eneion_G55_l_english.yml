    #1st Column
    G55_1_1_petition_degakheion_title: "Petition Degakheion"
    G55_1_1_petition_degakheion_desc: "We are the first Nékhei, in rank, founding, prestige, and size. We have long been the most preeminent of the Devandi kheions, a position which we intend to keep. Unfortunately, we have had to watch with great dissatisfaction as our cousins have grown and come to challenge us. If only we had a way to forcefully put them in their place. Thankfully, our parent kheion has ambitions of their own. They seek the unification of the Kheionai under their leadership. These 2 goals are not incompatible, and in fact perfectly complement one another. We will send diplomats to Degakheion, to negotiate a settlement that will help both them and us achieve our ambitions."
    G55_1_3_prepare_the_conquest_title: "Prepare The Conquest"
    G55_1_3_prepare_the_conquest_desc: "Our goal is clear; the dream of a unified Devand under our leadership. Even with the aid of our overlord, however, it will be a costly and difficult venture. We must prepare well before we embark upon this great undertaking."
    G55_1_4_slavers_bay_title: "Slavers Bay"
    G55_1_4_slavers_bay_desc: "To our north lie the kheions of Keyolíon and Empkeios. Well known for their widespread use of slavery and plantations, they stand in our way towards the unification of Devand. We must be careful, for our Basobhar auxiliaries have a deep, seething hatred of these 2 cities, and would like to see them wiped off the map if given the chance. Our merchants, however, seek the valuable ports Keyolíon and Empkeios have, and implore us to annex the kheions as quickly as possible."
    G55_1_5_fortify_the_gap_title: "Fortify The Gap"
    G55_1_5_fortify_the_gap_desc: "Between the Chendhyan plains and the Devandi Coast lies a mountain range, effectively cutting off both areas from each other. Unfortunately, there's a mountain pass near Empkeios, allowing Chendhyan raiders to bypass the city, and pillage our lands, and those of our fellow nékheis, with impunity. This must change in order for our northern frontiers to be secured. Our engineers have drawn up an ambitious design for an impenetrable mountain fortress that will block the northern pass into our lands. While expensive, it is essential for our defense."

    #2nd Column
    G55_2_2_build_up_eneion_title: "Build Up Eneion"
    G55_2_2_build_up_eneion_desc: "Our kheion was the first to be built east of The Cleaved Sea, and for generations we have maintained our status as the first nékheis, in both size and prestige. The other nékheis seem to have begun challenging our title, seeking to eclipse us. Our government officials have proposed a range of building projects and renovations in order to bring our great city to new heights; a plan which we must implement!"
    G55_2_4_squash_the_rabble_title: "Squash The Rabble"
    G55_2_4_squash_the_rabble_desc: "To our south lay the kheions of Apikhoxi and Besolakí. Primarily descended from, and ruled by lower class settlers from Alecand, these kheions are quite hostile to any sort of rule by us. As such, they are our enemies, and stand in the way of our goals, and there is only one solution to that problem; we will conquer and squash this rabble."
    G55_2_5_consolidate_devand_title: "Consolidate Devand"
    G55_2_5_consolidate_devand_desc: "It is done. Almost the entirety of the Devand is under our rule. All that is left are the territories under our overlords’ control, and those of Deyeion. Our diplomats are already working on a compromise that would see these holdouts brought into our domain, at last allowing us to achieve the dream we have worked so hard for."

    #3rd Column
    G55_3_1_settle_the_borderland_title: "Settle The Borderland"
    G55_3_1_settle_the_borderland_desc: "Between us and Besolakí to our south live many Basobhar tribes, eking out an existence upon the windy plains. For generations, these tribes have kept an alliance with our humble kheion, and on numerous occasions we have helped each other against any that disturb this status quo. Unfortunately, it seems clear to our policy makers that loosely aligned Basobhar tribes alone will not be enough to secure our southern border. We must fortify the frontier with our own people!"
    G55_3_2_ministry_of_the_interior_title: "Managing Relations"
    G55_3_2_ministry_of_the_interior_desc: "We have adopted a policy of vassalizing the disorganized tribes within our lands, much to the chagrin of our Kheionai brethren. We have run into issues however, with many disputes between our tribal allies and our citizens flaring up. One of our senior ministers has proposed the creation of a new ministry, dedicated to handling the affairs of the settlers and the Basobhar, and the relations between the two groups."
    G55_3_3_develop_the_eneionam_title: "Develop The Eneionam"
    G55_3_3_develop_the_eneionam_desc: "We have acquired all the lands that surround the Eneionam, and have settled it with our own people. Now we must develop it into a rich land, in order to make it the wealthiest area of Devand. It will show all others the benefits of our rule, such that even the most stubborn of tribes will side with us!"
    G55_3_4_pathetic_pirates_title: "Pathetic Pirates"
    G55_3_4_pathetic_pirates_desc: "Amgremos, the first independent nékheis. Amgremos, the last independent bastion of Kimabhen culture. Amgremos, a haven of pirates, stalking the seas and damaging our trade with the east. We must conquer this rogue kheion and put an end to their piratical ways!"
    G55_3_6_take_control_title: "Take Control"
    G55_3_6_take_control_desc: "Any sensible and well behaved child should take care of their elderly parents. This is the case for many civilizations, and we are no different. We have long since dwarfed our parent city Degakheion, in both power and prestige. We must take the lead now, in order to keep them safe and secure."

    #4th Column
    G55_4_2_up_the_eneionam_title: "Up The Eneionam"
    G55_4_2_up_the_eneionam_desc: "The Eneionam river is the lifeblood of our kheion. It feeds our crops and our people, and is a vital artery for internal transport. Unfortunately, we do not control the entirety of its length. The tribes of the upper Eneionam have not yet bowed down to us, but with a bit of convincing, maybe they will change their tune."
    G55_4_3_dtsiaerh_allegiance_title: "Dtsiaerh Allegiance"
    G55_4_3_dtsiaerh_allegiance_desc: "The Dtsiaerh tribes are formidable and warlike. Their unfortunate positioning has seen them stuck between hostile Basobhar tribes to the south, Chendhyan raiders to the east, and Kheionai slavers to the north. Forced to fend for their survival for generations, our generals expected a long war to ensue when our settlers moved into their lands. However, it seems the Dtsiaerh have heard of our tribal vassalization policy, and their chiefs wish to see our Kylakas personally."
    G55_4_4_entice_alecandi_immigration_title: "Encourage Immigration"
    G55_4_4_entice_alecandi_immigration_desc: "Our existence has been fueled by immigration from Alecand. Events in Alecand have caused the small trickle of migrants that we are used to, to turn into a flood. The ever-looming Kaydhano, constant warfare, and overcrowding have forced many Alecandi to leave the isle in search of better opportunities on the mainland. Many of our ministers are arguing for improved coastal facilities in Eneion itself, in order to soak up as much of this immigration wave for ourselves."
    G55_4_5_secure_the_hinterlands_title: "Secure The Hinterlands"
    G55_4_5_secure_the_hinterlands_desc: "While we seek to conquer the southern kheions of Devand, we must also keep in mind the hinterlands of these cities. Full of unaligned tribes, who hold no love for us and our Kheionai brethren, they will be a permanent threat to our conquests for as long as they remain independent. They will bend the knee, either by choice or force."

    #5th Column
    G55_5_1_fill_the_library_title: "Fill The Library"
    G55_5_1_fill_the_library_desc: "The Trilidir library has yet to be filled. There are still empty bookshelves within; a problem our philosophers demand be rectified. While we could simply order books to be copied and brought in from Alecand, our philosophers see value in the ways of the Basobhar and our humble settlers, and seek state funding to write texts of their lives. Specifically, these philosophers seek to record the myths, tales, faith, traditions and languages of the Basobhar, and demand that the state sponsor their endeavors. We will support these philosophers, and store the texts they produce in The Trilidir Library, killing 2 birds with one stone."
    G55_5_2_windy_wine_title: "Windy Wine"
    G55_5_2_windy_wine_desc: "The windy plain between our great kheion and Besolakí has been noticed by many winegrowers and merchants as a place greatly suited for the cultivation of wine, a luxury product desperately craved for by many aristocrats and philosophers. Our officials have put forward plans to set up massive vineyards across the windy plain, and tax all the immense profits that would be generated from them."
    G55_5_3_ruby_rush_title: "Ruby Rush"
    G55_5_3_ruby_rush_desc: "Deep within the Devandi highlands, our prospectors have discovered a great deposit of highly sought after, blood-red rubies near Lake Mteidhan. Already, many have moved to the area, hoping to mine the precious gems and sell them to merchants at a great profit. Our traders and aristocrats demand infrastructure be built here to maintain and exploit the "Ruby Rush"."
    G55_5_4_copper_woods_title: "Copper Woods"
    G55_5_4_copper_woods_desc: "Within the forest north of Besolakí lies a great deposit of copper. Such a deposit has gone unnoticed, until now. Plans have been drawn up to build a series of mines in the area that will be invaluable to us in the production of cannons and any other kind of bronzeworking."
    G55_5_5_iron_mountain_title: "Iron Mountain"
    G55_5_5_iron_mountain_desc: "Our prospectors have discovered a massive deposit of easily minable iron in the lands of the Dtsiaerh tribes. Our diplomats have already bought the land around the iron deposits. Now we just need to begin mining it. Once the mining begins, we will finally have a consistent source of iron for ourselves, with no more need to rely on foreign imports."

#Events
    eneion_events.1.t: "Negotiating With Degakheion"
    eneion_events.1.d: ""We will send an offer to our sovereign, the mightiest of the great kheions: An offer of cooperation, which will give us the ability to declare war without their intervention, while reassuring our loyalty to them." said the Eneioni minister of foreign affairs.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName], with a look of skepticism, asked a simple question, "Are you sure you will be able to convince the Degakheioni of this proposal?"\n\nThe foreign minister, clearly confused, responded, "My team of diplomats are the greatest across The Cleaved Sea. We have made many a deal with the barbarians, and the Degakheioni have agreed to our proposals before. Why would you doubt us now?"\n\n"Because,"" said [Root.Monarch.GetName], in a concerned manner, "It won’t be just your head upon a spear if you were to fail. This is perhaps one the most important diplomatic offers Eneion has ever made. The consequences of a rejection are immense…""
    eneion_events.1.a: "Send the offer, and hope they accept."

    eneion_events.2.t: "Our Tribal Allies"
    eneion_events.2.d: "A group of Basobhar chiefs enter a local fortress, recently built by the Eneioni. The land the fort sits upon was up until recently controlled by the very same chiefs who now walk in its halls as guests. Within a special conference room lay a large table with copies of the treaties the chiefs are to sign. As the chiefs set foot in the room, a mixture of anger, fear, and worry is clearly visible on their faces. Opposite them sat [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\n"Fear not, allies! While our longstanding alliance may have ended in less than favorable circumstances, we hope you will forgive us. It was necessary for the security of our southern border. While you may live in our land now, you will not suffer the fate others in your position would have. We seek a new relationship between our parties, one that would be beneficial for both of us!"\n\nThe chiefs remained concerned. While many of them were illiterate, they had all brought tribal scribes with them, who could read the Kheionai language. The chiefs directed their scribes to read aloud the treaty the Eneioni had laid out, in the Basobhar language. \n\nOnce the scribes finished reading aloud, the chiefs turned to each other, both shocked and relieved. They had all heard of the fate other tribes had suffered at the hands of the Kheionai, and feared the worst. \n\nOne of the younger chieftains, who was fluent in the Kheionai language, questioned [Root.Monarch.GetName], "If I understand this correctly, our tribes will be granted much autonomy, in exchange for helping defend your land?"\n\n "Correct." replied [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
    eneion_events.2.a: "An offer too tempting to refuse."

    eneion_events.3.t: "A Meeting In The Sacred Grove"
    eneion_events.3.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] traveled to a sacred grove, a place of great importance to the Basobhar tribes of the upper Eneionam. The grove served as a meeting place among the Basobhar chiefs. The significance was clear to all in attendance. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had brought no guards with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], only a few high ranking diplomats. The chiefs too had brought no warriors with them. This was not a place for bloodshed after all.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] spoke in Basobhar, with a Kheionai accent, "You are tasked with leading your tribes into the future, a harsh task at times, but one you have accomplished well this far. I speak for the kheion of Eneion, a state that has sent settlers to this land. We seek a relationship with all of you, one of mutual cooperation and benefit. You have undoubtedly had…less than pleasant interactions with those of similar appearance to myself; but we are different: We will recognize your sovereignty in the lands you currently possess. However, in return we wish for aid, of a military nature: An agreement you would be wise to accept."\n\nOne of the Eneioni diplomats began reading the agreement aloud in the Basobhar tongue. The chieftains were already amazed by the treatment they had received from the Eneioni, and It did not take much more convincing for the Basobhar to agree to the Eneioni terms. Later in the day, religious festivals would be held, with [Root.Monarch.GetName] as a guest of honor."
    eneion_events.3.a: "A Great Success!"

    eneion_events.4.t: "Allegiance of the Dtsiaerh"
    eneion_events.4.d: "In a large tent, located in the hills south of Keyolíon, stood the chieftains of the Dtsiaerh tribes. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped into the tent, and took a look at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] surroundings. No weapons present, and no warriors either: A good sign. \n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] closed the entrance to the tent behind  [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and addressed the chieftains, "I am [Root.Monarch.GetName], the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Eneion. I have received your request for a meeting. I have granted it, and now stand before you. So, what do you want to discuss?"\n\nThe most powerful of the chieftains, a great warrior that towered over [Root.Monarch.GetName], responded, "We have heard of the deals you have made with the tribes to the south. We seek such a deal too."\n\nA visible smile crept up [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s face, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] realized the best case scenario for the meeting was playing out before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] very eyes."
    eneion_events.4.a: "The Barbarians willingly submitted themselves. Incredible!"

    eneion_events.5.t: "A Peculiar Envoy"
    eneion_events.5.d: "Today, a large envoy has arrived from a subject of ours, the nékheis of Eneion.They come with the most intriguing of offers. They propose to support our efforts in the unification of the Kheionai as a partner. With our aid, they claim, they will be able to unify the nékheis. They offer eternal loyalty, and some lucrative benefits for our merchants, in exchange for the aid we would give them. \n\nOur officials and our warrior elite have been furiously debating the issue of whether to accept or deny Eneion’s proposal. It is clear that denying them will not go down well with the Eneioni, and may end up creating a new enemy. If we accept the deal, however, we may end up creating a power stronger than we may realize.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] sits alone in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] private office, weighing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] options. The decision, in the end, rests upon  [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] alone."
    eneion_events.5.a: "Accept the proposal. Saves us the trouble of conquering Devand."
    eneion_events.5.b: "Deny the proposal. The Eneioni clearly have treasonous intentions."

    eneion_events.6.t: "Eneion Requests Aid"
    eneion_events.6.d: "The Eneioni request aid from us in their conflicts. Joining their wars will bring us into yet another conflict. Refusing their call, however, will make them very displeased."
    eneion_events.6.a: "Answer the call!"
    eneion_events.6.b: "They made their bed. Let them lie in it."

    eneion_events.7.t: "An Entitled Lot"
    eneion_events.7.d: "Our conquest of the kheions of Keyolíon and Empkeios has left the elites of the two cities deeply displeased. They see our state as one that serves bharbhen interests, not those of the "civilized". The merchants and sugar-lords of The Axehead Bay have become more and more discontent over the months following our takeover. Disputes between our Basobhar troops and the Kheionai population have also become increasingly common, and incidents of raids on slave-pens, vigilante violence, and more, have been occurring more frequently of late in the cities. \n\nIt seems the elites of the two kheions have put their differences aside and banded together. Today, they stormed into the capitol building, demanding an audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They demand the ability to partake in the practice of slavery freely, and for us to always side with their interests against our Basobhar allies.\n\nAt the same time, our allied chieftains have been pushing for the abolition of slavery in our state, and if not that, at least the stopping of the enslavement of their brethren.\n\nThe tension between the two groups is growing to a dangerous level, and it is clear we must side with one side or the other. [Root.Monarch.GetName] sits alone in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] home. A decision must be made, a decision [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will announce tomorrow."
    eneion_events.7.a: "We have known the Basobhar for longer. We side with our allies."
    eneion_events.7.b: "We must curry favor with the nobles of our conquered territories. We side with the landowners."

    eneion_events.8.t: "Sacking Slavers"
    eneion_events.8.d: "When we first entertained the idea of letting the Basobhar join our army, many of our more cautious officers warned of their enmity towards certain kheions. It seems those fears have been confirmed, as our Basobhar troops razed Keyolíon and Empkeios to the ground.\n\nThe survivors now petition for aid from the government in the rebuilding of their cities. Meanwhile, our Basobhar troops are pressuring us to let this disaster go unpunished."
    eneion_events.8.a: "Send efforts to rebuild the kheions, and punish the perpetrators."
    eneion_events.8.b: "Those two kheions undoubtedly still hold a grudge against us. We side with the Basobhar."

    eneion_events.9.t: "Angered Peasantry"
    eneion_events.9.d: "The states of Besolakí and Empkeios were the most rural of the Kheionai. Their societies were organized around little villages spread across the countryside, with their capitals being very small in comparison to even other nékheis. The average citizen of the states was the humble farmer, owning and working a small plot of land and selling his excess produce to merchants, who would then transport the products to Alecand. For generations, this is how these two nékheis functioned.\n\nWith our conquest, however, the society of the Besolbhen and Apikhobhen has been severely disrupted. Traditionally, the property rights of the minor farmers were heavily protected by the kheions here. Now, our landowners are drooling at the opportunity to buy up massive amounts of land at cheap prices for themselves, at the expense of the locals. \n\nIn response, the peasants have banded together into armed militias, and have made one single demand to our state. They demand the same protections for their property to be restored under our rule. The landowners, in response, demand the ability to buy up land with no oversight from us. \n\nThe two groups have begun arming themselves, and now it seems we will have to make a choice."
    eneion_events.9.a: "We must not endanger our conquests just to appease the nobles. Side with the peasants."
    eneion_events.9.b: "We will not be threatened by a bunch of peasants. Side with the landowners."

    eneion_events.10.t: "Corsair Envoy"
    eneion_events.10.d: "With our conquest of Amgremos, the corsairs have lost their main base of operations. Piracy through the passage will surely decrease in prevalence now. Of course, our military began raiding corsair bases within the kheion as soon as our occupation began. The pirates must have started to feel the pressure coming down on them, because today an envoy claiming to be sent by one of the most powerful of the corsairs has come, hoping to make an offer with us.\n\nThey state they will work for us in exchange for a pardon. While hiring pirates in our ranks won’t look good in front of other states, the corsairs have decades of naval experience, something which we sorely lack. If we instead decide to continue with our policy of hunting them down, we will gain a much greater international reputation, one which our diplomats say will be needed in the future."
    eneion_events.10.a: "Have the pirates work for us. They will be very useful."
    eneion_events.10.b: "Hang the envoy, and bring every single corsair to justice!"

    eneion_events.11.t: "Passing Of The Torch"
    eneion_events.11.d: "Woe to us! Eneion, our subject, has grown far too powerful and arrogant to handle, and now they have the GALL to demand OUR submission!"
    eneion_events.11.a: "We have no choice. We will accept this "protection.""
    eneion_events.11.b: "Let them be...for now."
    eneion_events.11.c: "Scoundrels! We will subjugate them once more, this time, permanently!"

    eneion_events.13.t: "The First of the Nékheis"
    eneion_events.13.d: ""The Enebhen are master diplomats, explorers, and pioneers. They carry with them a certain sense of arrogance, seeing themselves as above the other nékheis. In the face of their Alecandi overlord, however, they proclaim fervent loyalty…" -Ultaris Darides, "The Peoples of Devand"\n\nThe kheion of Eneion was the first Kheionai city built in Devand. For generations, the elves of Eneion have maintained great relations with their tribal neighbors, something every other kheion has failed at. The diplomats of Eneion are known as some of the greatest of their craft, able to make even the most stubborn Chendhyan cooperate, and the most reluctant of enemies to make peace. In comparison to their criminal and rebellious brother-kheion of Deyeion, Eneion puts on a display as the perfect subject to their Degakheioni sovereign.\n\nIt is now the year 1444. As events in Alecand have led to more immigration to Devand than ever before, the race to colonize the interior has begun. The Eneioni have already made plans to make sure they come out on top, and seek to unify Devand with the aid of the Basobhar and their militaristic overlords.\n\n§BIn order to complete Eneion’s mission tree, it is highly recommended that Eneion stays a vassal of Degakheion.§!"
    eneion_events.13.a: "We will make our forefathers proud."

    eneion_events.14.t: "Degakheion Accepts The Proposal!"
    eneion_events.14.d: "As hoped, the Degakheioni have accepted our proposal, giving us the freedom to declare wars without their oversight. Although we have much to give in trade concessions, it will all be worth it in the end."
    eneion_events.14.a: "Finally, we can pursue our destiny."

    eneion_events.15.t: "Degakheion Denies Our Proposal!"
    eneion_events.15.d: "Disaster! The Degakheioni have denied our proposal, and have even hinted that we have committed treasonous actions!"
    eneion_events.15.a: "Prepare the armies, we will have to achieve our ambitions without their cooperation."

    eneion_events.16.t: "Degakheion Concedes To Our Protection"
    eneion_events.16.d: "The Degakheioni have conceded to our protection agreement. We will take over the reigns of power now. They will be safe under our hegemony."
    eneion_events.16.a: "They will have a quiet retirement."

    eneion_events.17.t: "Degakheion Concedes, Begrudgingly"
    eneion_events.17.d: "The Degakheioni, in their boundless arrogance, have rejected our proposal, although it is clear they no longer see us as a subject. They have cut off all diplomatic ties, and barred our messengers at the city gates."
    eneion_events.17.a: "The old man still thinks he can live independently?"

    eneion_events.18.t: "Degakheion Declares War"
    eneion_events.18.d: "The Degakheioni, in their boundless arrogance, have executed our messengers, and declared our proposal an act of treason! They have sent their own delegation, bringing with them a declaration of war!"
    eneion_events.18.a: "Delusional."
