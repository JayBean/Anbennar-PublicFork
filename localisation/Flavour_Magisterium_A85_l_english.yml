 magisterium.1.t:0 "Expedition Preparations..."
 magisterium.1.d:0 "After several years of preparation, we have concentrated enough resources of the nation to mount a large-scale expedition. The goal is simple: To seize the secrets submerged beneath Damenath, salvage what can be salvaged, and discover secrets and relics of a time lost to ash."
 magisterium.1.a:0 "Launch the operation!"
 
 magisterium.2.t:0 "Diverging Opinions"
 magisterium.2.d:0 "With the logistics of the operation put in place, two divergent opinions appeared among the leaders of the expedition. While some prefer to use large detection spells in order to spot any suspicious mechanism in the flooded area, others believe that sweeping the surrounding swamps and submerged land using a huge labor supply will bring better results."
 magisterium.2.a:0 "We will scan the area"
 magisterium.2.b:0 "We're not here for a chirurgical strike"
 
 magisterium.3.t:0 "A Magic Mechanism"
 magisterium.3.d:0 "What first looked like a large stone rising to the sky was actually an obelisk of unknown material, marking the location of a partially flooded underpass. Animated by a second wind after months of excavation, the expedition has begun to quickly unearth the secrets of this passage."
 magisterium.3.a:0 "Forward!"
 
 magisterium.4.t:0 "Mage Tomb"
 magisterium.4.d:0 "What at first looked like a huge and dilapidated black room has been revealed to be a huge cache, filled with pristine treasures! Galvanized, the expedition picked up again, until they lifted the veil on a huge tomb, apparently belonging to an old and powerful mage... whose skeletal remains suggest elven bearing?!"
 magisterium.4.a:0 "All these efforts finally pay off"
 mage_stash:0 "Precursor Mage's Cache"
 
 magisterium.5.t:0 "Swamp of Sorrows"
 magisterium.5.d:0 "Within the marsh itself, there are a myriad of stinky charms, punctuated in the peat that appears as the area is emptied of any form of moisture. The permanent relay of various teams of mages and mowers finally revealed an entire part of the sunken city. Although most of these buildings are unusable or worthless, one of them, strangely well preserved, caught the attention of the expedition, which is now directing all its efforts towards this strange building."
 magisterium.5.a:0 "Onward!"
 
 magisterium.6.t:0 "Laboratory"
 magisterium.6.d:0 "We quickly pierced the entrance of this strange, temple-seeming building, and disabled its magic golems. It has turned out to actually be a laboratory, filled with all kinds of curiosities dating from an age well older than anyone here present. With this discovery, the expedition finally comes to an end, allowing the Magisterium to access a whole lot of new knowledge and relics. At first glance, our leading historians suggest that the precursors may have been experimenting on the native Halanni humans?!"
 magisterium.6.a:0 "Success!"
 mag_big_laboratory:0 "Precursor Laboratory"
 
 
 magisterium.7.t:0 "Skyfall"
 magisterium.7.d:0 "Shattering the skies upon its arrival, a titanic sphere, coated with fire and flames tinged with a pearly blue, crosses the sky at full speed, crashing perpendicularly to the center of the altar created for the ritual. The blast of the explosion destroyed all the preemptive barriers set up, shaving plains and hills, tearing jungle and forest, vitrifying the sand, liquefying the rock. But no matter the means employed, the result is there: The largest Damestear deposit on the planet. Radiant with a twilight glow, and defying the beauty of the most beautiful women in Halann."
 magisterium.7.a:0 "'And now, I am become Death.'"

 magisterium.8.t:0 "Create Raid Team"
 magisterium.8.d:0 "Launching the 'Make it Fall' operation requires a huge amount of preparation and resources. In order to start gathering these, it is necessary to assemble a rapid response team, able to respond effectively to all the needs that the operation requires."
 magisterium.8.a:0 "Launch search notices"
 
 magisterium.9.t:0 "Raid Team Operational"
 magisterium.9.d:0 "Led by the famous adventurer Leeroy, our raid team of the best mages, warriors, rogues and treasure hunters at our disposal is now in place!"

 magisterium.10.a:0 "Pray for they success"
 
 magisterium.11.t:0 "Preparations Ready"
 magisterium.11.d:0 "All the materials and ingredients necessary for the smooth running of the ritual have been brought together. Now that they have fulfilled their goal, it is time to send our men home, and bring in our most experienced Magicians."
 magisterium.11.a:0 "To Adráil!"
 
 magisterium.12.t:0 "Prepare the Site"
 magisterium.12.d:0 "It is time to erect a building capable of defying the heavens. May our wards be strong, and our incantations unshakable, for we will need all the strength of the celestial planes to accomplish this task."
 magisterium.12.a:0 "Make sure everything is perfect!"
 
 magisterium.13.t:0 "The Ritual Site"
 magisterium.13.d:0 "We are finally ready. After many years of work, we have set up a complex maze of wards and enchantments, ready to welcome the most powerful incantations of our most powerful magicians. The culmination of a decade of effort will finally pay off."
 magisterium.13.a:0 "Let's bring the heavens down."
 
 magisterium.15.t:0 "The Sack of Arca Aldresia"

 magisterium.15.a:0 "Prepare the Carriage"
 
 magisterium.16.t:0 "Anbenncóst Dilemma"
 magisterium.16.d:0 "The largest metropolis on the continent, Anbenncóst stands proudly on our border, welcoming every ship to Dameshead. The strategic position, the economic value, and the cultural heritage of this city do not allow it to remain without a master powerful enough to guarantee its independence. As undisputed leader of the Damesear, it is our duty to present to the Emperor our candidacy as guardian of the city of cities."
 magisterium.16.a:0 "Send the Proposal"
 
 magisterium.17.t:0 "Proposal from Above"
 magisterium.17.d:0 "With the support of the emperor, the Magisterium claims our independence. Should we accept this proposal, or refuse this ultimatum?"
 magisterium.17.a:0 "Let's accept it"
 magisterium.17.b:0 "Never!"
 
 magisterium.18.t:0 "They Accept"
 magisterium.18.d:0 "Illuminated by the superiority of our system, Anbenncóst accepted our offer and bent the knee."
 magisterium.18.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 magisterium.19.t:0 "They Refuse"
 magisterium.19.d:0 "These crazy Anbenncósters have lost their reason, decadent in their liberal ideals, and have refused our generous offer!"
 magisterium.19.a:0 "Where's the nearest War Wizard?!"
 
 magisterium.20.t:0 "Gems Excavated"
 magisterium.20.d:0 "Our wizards were right, and under the Moonmount there was indeed a huge amount of precious stones. Although their purity is not the best, it remains sufficient to ensure income and materials for our projects."
 magisterium.20.a:0 "Mine them all!"
