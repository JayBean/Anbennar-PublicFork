 flavor_magisterium.2.d:0 "With the logistics of the operation put in place, two divergent opinions appeared among the leaders of the expedition.

 flavor_magisterium.5.d:0 "Within the marsh itself, there are a myriad of stinky charms, punctuated in the peat that appears as the area is emptied of any form of moisture. The permanent relay of various teams of mages and mowers finally revealed an entire part of the sunken city. Although most of these buildings are unusable or worthless, one of them, strangely well preserved, caught the attention of the expedition, which is now directing all its efforts towards this strange building."

 flavor_magisterium.6.d:0 "We quickly pierced the entrance of this strange, temple-seeming building, and disabled its magic golems. It has turned out to actually be a laboratory, filled with all kinds of curiosities dating from an age well older than anyone here present. With this discovery, the expedition finally comes to an end, allowing the Magisterium to access a whole lot of new knowledge and relics.

The blast of the explosion destroyed all the preemptive barriers set up, shaving plains and hills, tearing jungle and forest, vitrifying the sand, liquefying the rock. But no matter the means employed, the result is there: The largest Damestear deposit on the planet. Radiant with a twilight glow, and defying the beauty of the most beautiful women in Halann."

He would later graduate from the academy and eventually, he was voted to lead it in 1419 at the age of 33 making him one of the youngest leaders of the Magisterium.\n\nCrovan's reign as grand magister began at the end of The Third Lilac War and just one year later after the death of Vincen "the Old Owl" Silmuna and the beginning of the Fourth Lilac War, Crovan would help change Cannorian history. The Silmuna Family halted the election process after the death of Vincen so Adenn "Skylance" Silmuna could rush home, getting there a day before the election. Adenn's Silmuna forces were ambushed by Lorentish and Wexonard forces and betrayed by many of his former allies in The Battle of the Moon Council. It isn't known how much Crovan was involved in the betrayal but many believe that his installment at such a young age and subsequent dealings with the new Wexonard Emperor were likely signs of conspiracy and political maneuvering. Following The Invasion of Damesear and the end of the war Crovan and the Magisterium was granted control over the western half of the Isle of Damesear. \n\nA master of both transmutation and enchantment schools, both Crovans lechery and wealth are vast in equal measure. He has sired numerous children, many who are set to become powerful mages in their own right.\n\nIt seems certain that Crovan's influence and magical prowess has secured the magisterial throne for his prodigious family for years to come."

A decision come to after long, long debate between the powers that be within the nation, that this information was too dangerous, too inflammatory. A revelation that could tear Cannor asunder.\n\n It is now, in the depths of this dark night, that the crux of this plan comes to fruition. They will hide the slowly piling evidence, censor it and bury it deep, deep within the capital to rot. A sound plan, to the minds who have desperately devised it.\n\n When [Root.Monarch.GetName] and their cadre of most trusted advisors and confidants arrive, they are shocked to find a haggard looking magister staring back at them. Instantly the magister launches into an explanation, that the magisterium has heard of what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was planning, and has decided to assist them, agreeing with their principal theory.

Thus, in a secret and private meeting, the Magisterium comes to a decision.\n\n Days later, and a Magister returns with satchels full of documents, evidence.
