 aelnar.1.t:0 "Zenith"
 aelnar.1.d:0 "It is obvious to all that our people today have nothing to do with who they were a few decades ago. Our ambitions, traditions, morals, and desires have evolved. We have matured and reached new heights. It is time to get rid of the chains of the past and embrace our destiny with all our strength; a destiny that we will engrave in the immense rock of time. May the world tremble when it learns the child of Venáil and Munas no longer exists. May the world tremble before the advent of a new giant. May the world tremble, and, in its fear, welcome the star that will illuminate the world."
 aelnar.1.a:0 "We are... Star Elves"
 aelnar_zenith_tt:0 "Every owned §YMoon Elf§! province:\n§Y90%§! chance culture will become §YStar Elf§!."
 
 aelnar.2.t:0 "A New Empire"
 aelnar.2.d:0 "The previous reforms of our nations have centralized power around a single dynasty, trusting the blood of one family to ensure the prosperity of our people. It is obvious today that while stable, this system has many flaws that every citizen is able to see. It is time for us to choose the best sovereign at our disposal. The empire will no longer be governed by the law of blood, but by something much greater: the capabilities of the best of our first class citizens."
 aelnar.2.a:0 "Proclaim the Empire!"
 
 aelnar.3.t:0 "Children of the Blade"
 aelnar.3.d:0 "For several years now, a warrior caste calling itself the Children of the Blade has been demanding political recognition and the establishment of a warlike order from Aelnar's governing body. The recent conquest of Tor Nayyi offers the possibility of establishing a powerful organization of elite soldiers in this territory. The Children of the Blade have jumped on the opportunity, promising to bring back prestige and establish a solid base of operations in the region for the glory of Aelnar."
 aelnar.3.a:0 "They are known as the Silblaidd Orda"
 
 aelnar.4.t:0 "The Countryside"
 aelnar.4.d:0 "According to recent reports, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decided to visit the countryside in order to appease the nascent tensions running through it, hoping to inspire faith in the royal family among the people."
 aelnar.4.a:0 "Let's hope we can dodge the storm..."
 
 aelnar.5.t:0 "The Fall"
 aelnar.5.d:0 "Terrified. That word defined the face of Eliendel, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s close adviser, as he read the letter that had just arrived. Some speak of an accident, others of an assassination. Whatever the cause, the horrible reality remains the same: the royal family is dead, their bodies found in a ravine. Faced with the absence of a designated sovereign, it falls to Eliendel to assume the reins of the country and guide it through the dark times ahead."
 aelnar.5.a:0 "Troubled time are coming..."
 
 aelnar.6.t:0 "The Last Seawatcher"
 aelnar.6.d:0 "The last surviving member of the Seawatcher dynasty, Calasandur, appeared today in front of the royal palace. Though he had previously announced his retirement from politics, Calasandur felt moved to action by the state of our great nation. It is with a long sigh of relief that Eliendel willingly gives up the reins of the country, convinced that only Calasandur can restore the situation."
 aelnar.6.a:0 "Thus is born: Calasandur Starseeker"
 
 aelnar.7.t:0 "Storm Wind"
 aelnar.7.d:0 "Taking advantage of the sovereign's weakened position, powerful noble families with ancestral roots demanded the establishment of distinct and well-established privileges, ostensibly to be able to govern their fiefdoms more effectively. Although at first sight this could seem to be a good idea, in truth it is a barely-masked act of defiance against royal power. Many peasants took up arms in parallel to defend their rights, having lost confidence in the capabilities of the sovereign."
 aelnar.7.a:0 "We need to enforce our control!"
 
 aelnar.10.t:0 "Silblaidd Territory"
 aelnar.10.d:0 "This territory is supposed to belong to the Orda Silblaidd. Without it, they cannot properly perform their service to our realm!"
 aelnar.10.a:0 "Give them their due"
 
 aelnar.11.t:0 "The Star Prevails!"
 aelnar.11.d:0 "Our great and enlightened culture is spreading across our dominion."
 aelnar.11.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 aelnar.12.t:0 "Faith Renewed"
 aelnar.12.d:0 "The idea of our people being subject to the will of any god is unacceptable to many elves. If religion we must have, then it will be a religion of state, in the service of the country and its people. Following the writings of Aelnar's greatest minds, a new philosophy will be established. This state religion is intended to guide the country into the future, with the Emperor of Aelnar as its sole leader."
 aelnar.12.d.b:0 "Our Great Prophet has saved us from the chaos that threatened to snuff out our light. Dahvar will lead us to a new era of glory. Our lessers writhe like maggots in the corpse of our once-glorious homeland. They cling to false idols and dead gods. They are fools. Do they not realize that there is but one thing worthy of worship? The form of the Star Elf is divine, pure, perfect. Only the stars in the night sky are our equals, for they are just like us. Our bodies are temples, our will divine. No-one will stand in our way. We will not allow degenerated mockeries of our divine image, and interlopers from the East pollute Aelantir with their presence any longer. The age of the star has begun."
 aelnar.12.a:0 "Soise Vio"
 aelnar.12.b:0 "Nur Dahvareasa"
 
 aelnar.16.t:0 "Peasant Revolt"
 aelnar.16.d:0 "A group of angry peasants have taken up arms to fight for their rights and ideas!"
 aelnar.16.a:0 "Foolish of them."
 
 aelnar.17.t:0 "The Dwindling Star"
 aelnar.17.d:0 "After years of civil war and countless victims, the lack of strongholds within the various factions tearing the country apart and the general lassitude of the people seems to finally be bringing the storm to an end."
 aelnar.17.a:0 "Never again..."
 
 aelnar.18.t:0 "Peace in our Time"
 aelnar.18.d:0 "After years of tearing each other apart, a semblance of unity seems to have brought the elves of Aelnar together once more. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches the royal balcony, overlooking the royal square, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] expresses [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], looking stern but sad: 'We understood each other.'\n\nUpon hearing this seemingly simple statement, all those assembled shed tears. From the various representatives of the factions to the inhabitants of the city and the peasants of the countryside, from the veterans of the war to the saints and the sinners, everyone shed tears. The news of an assembly of the country's greatest living minds spread rapidly; from this assembly emanated a series of reforms which greatly improved the unity of the people and opened the door for further, deeper, and even more effective reforms."
 aelnar.18.d.b:0 "After years of tearing each other apart, the bloody civil war has finally come to an end. Known as the Rianvisa, many new ideas emerged, shared across the country by blood and fire. Though many families and thinkers have paid the price, a semblance of serenity finally seems to have returned to the country."
 aelnar.18.a:0 "Forward. Together."

 aelnar.19.t:0 "Noble Revolt"
 aelnar.19.d:0 "A group of arrogant nobles have mobilized their troops and started enforcing order in their fiefdoms through sheer tyranny!"
 aelnar.19.a:0 "We need to put them down"
 
 aelnar.20.t:0 "Kwineh Rebellion"
 aelnar.20.d:0 "The first victims of the Aelnar conquests, the Noruin natives never could adapt to the new system imposed on them. As the country sinks into chaos and anarchy, there is no better time to rebel than now."
 aelnar.20.a:0 "Why are they so many?"
 
 aelnar.21.t:0 "Calasandur Takes Arm!"
 aelnar.21.d:0 "As the chaos gnawing at the country spread to the gates of the imperial capital, an exhausted messenger knocked at the door of the throne room, doubtlessly bringing some new, dark news from the front lines. Contemplating the horizon through one of the room's huge windows, Calasandur turned to his sword, laying on the wall.\n\n'Dread it, run from it, Destiny still arrives. And it's here. Or should I say...'"
 aelnar.21.a:0 "I am."

 aelnar.24.t:0 "One Who Would Be Queen"
 aelnar.24.d:0 "The war that has riven our empire is finally over, with the last of the pretenders having been put down. The defeat of Lithiel was the final nail in the coffin of popular support for the factions seeking our overthrow. Now we have the task of sorting out the aftermath, starting with she who would have been Queen."
 aelnar.24.a:0 "Her death invites more trouble than it's worth, imprison her."
 aelnar.24.b:0 "We can accept no treason against the state. Have her executed."
 aelnar.24.c:0 "Lithiel did not rebel for personal gain. She might make a good consort."
 aelnar.24.e:0 "We need a unifying figure to lead us."
 
 aelnar.25.t:0 "The Empress Regent"
 aelnar.25.d:0 "Grave Tidings, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is dead. Lithiel mourns, and the nation mourns with her. This has unfortunately brought up the thorny issue of succession, and while Lithiel is indeed grief stricken, several are already pushing for her to take the throne in her spouse's place."
 aelnar.25.a:0 "The people love her; all hail the new Empress!"
 aelnar.25.b:0 "Our advisors step above themselves, she will never rule."
 
 aelnar.26.t:0 "Lithiel Ascendant"
 aelnar.26.d:0 "The Rianvisa is over! After many months, the bloody civil war has finally reached its conclusion after Lithiel defeated the other would be petty kings, and triumphantly marched into the capital to be crowned monarch with the Circlet of Stars. All hail our new Empress! All hail a new age for Aelnar!"
 aelnar.26.a:0 "A New Monarch for a New Age."
 
 aelnar.27.t:0 "Duties of an Empress"
 aelnar.27.d:0 "It seems that an ever-growing number of papers and issues are beginning to reach our monarch's desk, either because of her popularity or the assurance that she will give her full attention to the matter. It seems now that every appointment and decision must be approved by Lithiel, no matter how small."
 aelnar.27.a:0 "We can only hope she does not try to do too much..."
 
 aelnar.28.t:0 "Struggle Within, Struggle Without"
 aelnar.28.d:0 "Our Empress is alone. Of course, she is surrounded by admirers and advisors at almost all times; however, there is no one who she can actually confide in or speak to as an equal. She is an Empress, and every moment of every day must go into keeping up that appearance. This act is wearing on her. Cracks sometimes appear in her perfect facade, and in her weaker moments, she hears another voice, one which whispers to blow it all away. A voice that once remained silent through Lithiel's iron control. Elissa is her name, and she desires only one thing: complete control."
 aelnar.28.a:0 "Duty is heavy as a mountain, death is light as a feather."
 
 aelnar.29.t:0 "The Mask Cracks"
 aelnar.29.d:0 "Tragedy has struck today. Lithiel is gone, though her body remains. During a routine audience in the throne room, our glorious Empress slumped and fell over on her throne, and none of her advisors nor her guards have found a way to rouse her. She seems to be in an almost magical sleep and all of our greatest medical minds are baffled. The strangest thing is that her body is cold to the touch, almost cold enough to give her attendants frostbite as they tried to help. She keeps muttering one word over and over, like a delirious chant: 'Elissa'."
 aelnar.29.a:0 "Her country needs her."
 
 aelnar.30.t:0 "Assassination Attempt"
 aelnar.30.d:0 "No one knows who sent them, or even what their name was. Last night, an assassin stole into Arca Ore and reached our Empress' chamber without being challenged — and once there, they made sure that Lithiel's sleep would never end."
 aelnar.30.a:0 "Maybe it was for the best."
 aelnar.30.b:0 "By the Six, what have we done?"
 
 aelnar.31.t:0 "The Ice Fall"
 aelnar.31.d:0 "The assassin succeeded, and Lithiel's sleep is now eternal. Unfortunately, what woke instead is something much, much worse. The voice of madness that Lithiel strove with all her will to contain, that eventually struck her down, is now free and wearing our Empress's skin as her own. Her first action with her new body was to reward the assassin by obliterating him with pillars and spears of ice, along with the entire royal palace. Arca Ore is now a monument of destruction, captured in its death throes and shattered towers, with a sound that woke the empire. The only person to emerge from its carnage was our Empress, clothed in raiments of snow and chill, sapping the warmth from everything around her. Hail Lithiel Reborn! Hail our Queen Returned!"
 aelnar.31.a:0 "Lithiel is Mine..."
 
 aelnar.32.t:0 "The Crystal Queen"
 aelnar.32.d:0 "Lithiel has demanded that the heads of our empire come to the shattered frozen ruins of our capital for a feast celebrating her awakening. They were not given the option of refusing. Once there, in a cleared out space where the throne hall once stood, Lithiel crowned herself in frost to oversee this twisted mockery of the once noble court. She bade her guests to drink and eat, and once the meal was over, she stood again, upon the remains of the throne, wreathed in majesty, and proclaimed herself Queen of a new Aelnar. Queen of Frost. The Crystal Queen. She proclaimed that every knee and heart will bow to her and swear an oath of loyalty past even death."
 aelnar.32.a:0 "On Bended Knees We Swear."
 
 aelnar.33.t:0 "The Icy Ambitions"
 aelnar.33.d:0 "The destruction of Arca Ore and the attempted assassination of our Empress almost tore the heart from our empire, and it did destroy its administration. However, our Crystal Queen survived, and the capital can be rebuilt. Lithiel has come up with plans for a new capital, one that will match her icy majesty. These plans will require even more effort and materials than what was used for the original palace, but Lithiel has already solved the problem of magical muscle. The Ruinborn of our empire are much more useful than the vermin they resemble, able to store and absorb excessive amounts of magical energy from their surroundings. Our Empress has devised a way for our own mages to tap this well as if the Ruinborn were living batteries. Finally, they will have a use!"
 aelnar.33.a:0 "Long Live the Queen!"
 
 aelnar.34.t:0 "The Lady Retires"
 aelnar.34.d:0 "Time marches forward, leaving those of a past age behind. The Star Elves are no different, no matter how much we strive to stay ahead. Today, Lithiel signaled her intention to leave public life until her last days. While she once rebelled against our just rulers, we can only mourn the loss of such a beloved public figure. A mourning festivity has already been planned to see her away from the harbor on her trip to Silent Repose, where she will spend her remaining years."
 aelnar.34.a:0 "Have a good trip."
 
 aelnar.35.t:0 "Arca Lithiaer"
 aelnar.35.d:0 "Today, in the new frozen land that Lithiel has proclaimed the capital of our empire, the palace slowly rises into the air. Made of ice and stone, and powered by crystallized magic, this new floating fortress will be the beating heart of our administration, and it is the first step in recapturing the glory we once held. We will rise above the precursors. We are the Stars!"
 aelnar.35.a:0 "We have only just begun."
 
 aelnar.36.t:0 "A Time Served"
 aelnar.36.d:0 "Lithiel has carried out her sentence for rebelling against our empire during the Rianvisa. While some would argue that no punishment is too great for such treason, we have found in our infinite mercy grounds to let her leave unopposed."
 aelnar.36.a:0 "May she do good once again."
 
 aelnar.37.t:0 "A Grand Escape"
 aelnar.37.d:0 "Lithiel is free. By what we can only assume was some misguided loyalty from a general who should have been abandoned, Lithiel was freed from prison through an escape both ingenious and audacious. A commotion was caused at the prison and a fire was lit, causing many of the guards to be drawn away to fight the blaze. Guards we assume to have been loyal to the renegade general were left to guard her cell, unlocked it, and replaced her with a body double. We know that Lithiel was then shepherded through the postern gate, where she was intercepted by a random patrol that stumbled upon them. The guards tried valiantly, but they were no match for a battle hardened explorer like Lithiel.\n\nThis we can only know because one of the guards managed to survive his wounds long enough to tell the Warden. Our advisors already ordered an immediate closure of the harbor to find her, but it is unlikely to matter; too much time has already passed, and more than 50 ships have been in and out of the wharfs. We must prepare for the worst and assume that Lithiel will remain a sword at our neck until she perishes, no matter where she has landed."
 aelnar.37.a:0 "Curses!"
 
 aelnar.38.t:0 "A Soldier With No Home"
 aelnar.38.d:0 "A general from the land of Stars who once raised her flag in rebellion has arrived today in our court, offering her services in exchange for a home. Do we accept this Lithiel to lead our armies?"
 aelnar.38.a:0 "Welcome her."
 aelnar.38.b:0 "We do not need to anger the Stars."
 
 aelnar.39.t:0 "The Next Chapter"
 aelnar.39.d:0 "Our ruler is dead. After guiding our people through dark times, and charting a new path through fraught waters, they have finally succumbed to time's embrace. Now that the period of mourning has come to a close, the people are demanding a new leader to take their place. Our ruler's heir is not an acceptable person in the eyes of the Stars, overshadowed as they were by their parent's grandeur. Instead, two other names have been put forward, two of the great voices of our rebirth. Calasandur, a general and warrior of tradition and refinement, and Lithiel, an explorer and hero of the people."
 aelnar.39.a:0 "Lithiel leads us forward into the Future."
 aelnar.39.b:0 "Calasandur must reinforce Tradition."
 
 aelnar.40.t:0 "Lithiel's Dream"
 aelnar.40.d:0 "Lithiel has revealed to her advisors her plan for the foreseeable future. An empire of worth, one that will never fall down again. Every person giving what they can, and then more. For this dream to succeed, she requires every citizen of elven blood, even those once overlooked. She has put forth the radical ideal of rewarding work with honor and recognition, elevating those of the Ruinborn that work with our great empire rights and duties once thought exclusive to the Star Elves. While never being truly equal, it will give them incentives to excel under her rule. The advisors were apprehensive of the plan, but in the end agreed."
 aelnar.40.a:0 "She has yet to lead us wrong..."
 
 aelnar.41.t:0 "An Eye in Every City"
 aelnar.41.d:0 "Whispers of discontent and treachery have twined their way through our empire. Even if untrue, the lie of such a thing can be just as insidious as the truth. It has come to our advisors even within their ivory towers, and for that reason the situation has become intolerable. The creation of a secret police, to ferret out these malcontents, no matter where they hide, is of the utmost importance. We shall gather a group of the most supremely talented and loyal people in the empire to make up this new apparatus that is answerable only to our supreme sovereign. Let nothing escape our Crystal Eye."
 aelnar.41.a:0 "An ear at every door."
 
 aelnar.42.t:0 "Ruinborn Culture"
 aelnar.42.d:0 "Some of the Ruinborn we rule have taken it upon themselves to act in a more civilized manner, copying our traditions and cultures without truly understanding the art behind them. Barbarians must start somewhere after all."
 aelnar.42.a:0 "So even savages can act civilized."
 
 aelnar.43.t:0 "Duskers Rise"
 aelnar.43.d:0 "After years of hardship and struggle, we finally recognize the Duskers of [starborn_province.GetName] as valued members of our society. Let them wear the title of Starborn proudly. Let them be reborn in our light!"
 aelnar.43.a:0 "This can only be celebrated."
 
 aelnar.8.t:0 "Prominent Figures"
 aelnar.8.d:0 "The fractures beginning to form in our delicate society are becoming increasingly difficult to miss. One can feel the people aligning themselves with various charismatic figures and hardening into factions. Roughly, they can be divided into five groups. Kayd, the famously stalwart soldier, commands widespread admiration and loyalty. His closest supporters are common soldiers and officers with ties to the existing military institution. Ironically, his faction has its most frequent clashes with the group that would ostensibly be most closely aligned to Kayd: the supporters of Sicrheior, the would-be conqueror and military reformer. Sicrheior wishes to abandon the army's traditional form of a small core of warriors, focused on cultivating honor and martial valor, in favor of a modern war machine geared entirely to the glorification of the Nation. Both agree the military should be the state's chief concern, but they are often at odds over what that military should actually look like. \n\nIn contrast, Dahvar, the famous priest and orator, has accumulated a devout following of those who believe peace, prosperity, and the exaltation of our values is best left in the capable hands of the clergy, guided, as they are, by spiritual concerns. Once, Dahvar's unorthodox theology centering on the glorification of the homeland and the ascension of the elven race would have been seen as controversial. By now, however, it seems as though almost every prominent religious figure in Aelnar is one of Dahvar's acolytes. Worried members of the royal household have begun whispering to each other about Dahvar's ambitions for theocratic rule, but, for fear of his popularity, few yet dare to openly stand against him. \n\nMost radical, and most intolerable, are the followers of Aelthanas the glass-worker. For him, the great expanse of riches presented by this new land has created a unique opportunity to overthrow the privileges of Aelnar's elites in favor of elevating the common person. His rhetoric against the ruling classes has only become more radical with time, including the outrageous demand that the land of our new nation be shared evenly among the people instead of going mostly to the most qualified, and dignified, members of our society. Even worse, he has begun calling for the abolition of monarchy!\n\nFinally, there are the loyal supporters of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 aelnar.8.a:0 "We must appease the others"
 
 aelnar.9.t:0 "The Heroine Appears"
 aelnar.9.d:0 "Lithiel Oathkeeper, the first elf to return to our homeland, has become a national symbol following the resettlement. Her exploits as Pathfinder have earned her the moniker 'the Heroine', a title that only captures a fraction of the general admiration she commands. Folk stories and exaggerated tall tales move quickly through the countryside, and she has become almost a member of our culture's literary canon practically overnight. It seems as though everyone wishes to compose poems, songs, dramas, and novels dedicated to this 'Heroine of Aelnar'. These stories reflect a simpler vision of frontier life, and they use Lithiel as a stand-in to exalt the virtues of our people as a whole. In an era of pessimism, Lithiel is the optimist's last refuge. As internal fissures begin to grow, she may in fact be the only unifying figure in the entire nation. Fortunately, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has secured her loyalty and managed to retain her services as a general."
 aelnar.9.a:0 "Hail to the Heroine, Hail to the Crown!"
 
 aelnar.13.t:0 "Faction Debate: The Flow of Money"
 aelnar.13.d:0 "It was once obvious where the bulk of state revenue should go: toward the resettlement of our homeland. Now that our grand project has been completed, it seems as though every faction has its own ideas for our growing tax revenues. Militarists have lobbied the government to expand our army and prepare for grand conquest. Followers of Dahvar have demanded that the money be spent on outfitting a legion of priests to unite the people under one organized faith. Aelthanas' radicals have, of course, demanded that the money be redistributed to the common people. Finally, those loyal to the existing institutions of governance see this as an opportunity to expand the state's administrative capabilities by reinvesting funds into the bureaucracy.\n\nWhere ought we direct our finances?"
 aelnar.13.a:0 "To the Army"
 aelnar.13.b:0 "To the Clergy"
 aelnar.13.c:0 "To the People"
 aelnar.13.e:0 "To the Bureaucracy"
 
 aelnar.14.t:0 "Faction Debate: The Character of Power"
 aelnar.14.d:0 "It has become clear that the temporary institutions created to govern the new nation are beginning to strain under the growing burden of administering our vast new holdings. Power must be vested in newer, more robust structures of administration. Our militarist factions, most closely linked to Kayd and Sicrheior, have proposed the creation of Governors-General with authority to execute and enforce the decrees of [Root.Monarch.GetName], but many look askance at the idea of giving the military this much power. Dahvar's faction has proposed the creation of theocratic administrative districts that combine both legal and religious administration and enforcement, which would surely upset the more liberal members of society. Aelthanas has suggested we convene regional democratic councils of citizens to address local issues without national oversight. Finally, many in the royal household have suggested that we train legions of new civil servants to expand the government's professional bureaucracy. \n\nWhat shall be done on this question?"
 aelnar.14.a:0 "Appoint Governors-General"
 aelnar.14.b:0 "Authorize Theocratic Districts"
 aelnar.14.c:0 "Convene Local Councils"
 aelnar.14.e:0 "Expand the Civil Service"
 
 aelnar.15.t:0 "Faction Debate: The Goal of the State"
 aelnar.15.d:0 "The resettlement of our ancient homeland has, paradoxically, created fertile ground for the sprouting of new ideas. Among these new ideas are questions attempting to define the essential purpose of things previously taken for granted. To these new thinkers, the state is constituted for some specific reason, though what that reason exactly is has become a matter of frequent debate at the house parties of our burgeoning intellectual class.\n\nSicrheior in particular has emerged as a supporter of the idea that the state exists primarily to protect the people and project their glory by developing the largest, most effective army possible. Dahvar and his acolytes, on the other hand, believe the state is but a mere instrument for spiritual growth and unity. As usual, Aelthanas' radicals have come up with the most outrageous proposal of all: the idea that the state exists primarily to safeguard the common person against the 'exploitation' of the elite class. Lastly, those most loyal to the monarch have articulated the idea that the state exists solely to promulgate the will of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. \n\nWhich position should we officially endorse?"
 aelnar.15.a:0 "The State exists for martial glory"
 aelnar.15.b:0 "The State exists for spiritual unity"
 aelnar.15.c:0 "The State exists for the common people"
 aelnar.15.e:0 "The State exists for the State"
 
 aelnar.44.t:0 "Faction Debate: The Unity Circular"
 aelnar.44.d:0 "'It has become clear that the project of Aelnar is threatened by factionalism, distrust, and conflict. As Sovereign, I implore the recipients of this letter to join me in a meeting to discuss compromise and come to a political settlement that will secure the unity and tranquility of the Nation in perpetuity.' \n\nThis letter, which was widely disseminated, became known almost immediately as the 'Unity Circular'. It invited Kayd the warrior, Aelthanas the glass-worker, Dahvar the priest, Sicrheior the conqueror, and several loyalist leaders to the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName] for what was supposed to be a calm, reasoned discussion on how a political ceasefire could be achieved before bitterness and factionalism tore the nation apart.\n\nInstead, it had almost the opposite effect. Finally meeting in person under the auspices of the Sovereign, each attendee stressed their loyalty to the crown but professed an unwillingness to work with any of the others. There is no doubt that in any other venue the talks would have devolved into outright brawling, but the watchful eye of the monarch managed to restrain the passions of the assembled faction leaders. \n\nSome in the royal household have suggested that if compromise with all of them cannot be achieved, then perhaps the monarchy ought to make clear it favors one of the leaders in particular to simplify the situation. Others, however, have suggested that the monarch remain defiantly above the petty squabbles of the factions. Which path ought we take?"
 aelnar.44.a:0 "Favor Kayd"
 aelnar.44.b:0 "Favor Aelthanas"
 aelnar.44.c:0 "Favor Dahvar"
 aelnar.44.e:0 "Favor Sicrheior"
 aelnar.44.f:0 "Favor no one"

Authorities thought they had dispersed the worst of the trouble and retired from the scene just like any other street incident. However, if one were paying close attention, you could hear the streets begin to whisper a few hours after sunset.\n\nSeizing on the alleged disrespect toward the shopkeeper, and decrying the system which granted privileges to obnoxious elites, Aelthanas convened a so-called 'Council of the Commons' which immediately declared itself in insurrection against the government. It did not take long for many radicalized workers, servants, and other members of the lower classes to rally to the radicals' banner. This 'Council' has promulgated declarations banning the monarchy, professing hatred for the ancient rights of our most august families, and promising redistribution of lands and funds upon the successful completion of the insurrection. The only good news for the State is that such drastic action is likely to alienate any sympathy for Aelthanas' movement among the more liberal nobles and elites."

However, no one predicted his release of an inflammatory document known as the 'Divine Proclamations', which calls for all the nation's faithful to take up arms against the government so that the secular authorities can be purged and a righteous, moral order can take over to shepherd the nation back to an era of relative stability.\n\nThough royal officials immediately suppressed the document, it has already begun to circulate in the underground press. Even more dangerously, one can never be sure if any given priest is actually an agent of Dahvar's rebellion. The faithful have begun to flock to a number of fortified positions in our most pious territories, and Dahvar has elevated a number of 'warrior-priests' to lead his army to victory."

Meanwhile, with so many state resources dedicated to winning the war, the basic functions of government have begun to lapse. The workshops, markets, and farms remain empty as the populace either shelters in their homes or fights in one of the forces roving across the land.\n\nSeeing all this, a group of the resettlement's early heroes and adventurers have pushed for Lithiel Oathkeeper, one of their own, to claim the throne and use her unifying presence to restore peace. Though hesitant at first, she has finally declared herself a claimant to the Crown. Her rallying cry of 'Peace and Honor' has sent vast numbers of average, normal citizens to her banner. Clamoring for a swift resolution to the conflict and a return to normal life, her supporters see her as a vehicle for those most mystical things — peace, security, and prosperity."

The holy men of the procession continued onward, past the prostrating men, leading their choir in mournful dirges as they began to surround the brazier. For a few moments, the only noise within the church were sorrowful tones, songs of grief for every chosen who died before Aelnar’s final victory.

 aelnar.81.d:0 "BY IMPERIAL DECREE - All elves are equal before the law. None is the greater or lesser of their brothers or sisters. All elves live to serve the Nation, and the Nation lives to serve all elves. Within these pages lies the unified Sibhil Càd, which explains at length the rights, obligations, and responsibilities of all true-blooded elves. May the laws enumerated in the following pages be the basis for mutual love, pride, honesty, and respect amongst the children of the Stars.\n\nSigned this [GetMonth], [GetYear] years since the Exile. Decreed by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] on the basis of the power invested in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] by the sovereignty of elvish blood."

 aelnar.82.d:0 "The death of the late emperor has left a yawning chasm in the halls of power. Already, officers and administrators are beginning to sharpen their knives for a coming power struggle. All eyes now turn to [Root.Monarch.GetName], who must prove themselves worthy of Sicrheior's legacy before the glory of the Empire is drowned once again in a new generation of blood. Fortunately, the blood of a genius is strong. There is no doubt that fools will see the folly of their doubts in due course."
 aelnar.82.a:0 "The Emperor is dead, long live the Emperor!"
 
 aelnar.83.t:0 "Thirsting For Power"
 aelnar.83.d:0 "What is an elf but the sum of their achievements? Beyond what one has done on this earth, all that will be left of them when they leave is but the words of those who knew them and the achievements that they have imparted on the earth. No matter the legacy, no matter the ambition, no matter the actions one has done in life the end result is all the same: death. \n\nElissa had long come to grips with this concept, this unfair hand she and every one of her kind was drawn. Work and work, only to die the same way any peasant or non-elf would? Even a lich could eventually be cut down, slain before the greatest of their plans could ever come to fruition. No, Elissa didn't want to achieve immortality through such mundane means, there was no guarantee the world wouldn't view her as a monster, rather than the genius she truly was. \n\nThe answer came to her from an unlikely place: a forest of trees tinted with the essence of ruination, an entire colony of trees that were born of the same seed, whose flowers produced fruits that would fall and recreate itself in a neverending cycle, a forest that was made of a thousand trees that were copies of copies of an original that was laid in the dirt long before recorded history. It was bizarre, and it was genius. \n\nIt was then that Elissa went to work on an ascendant ritual, fed by the magics extracted from the blood of a million beasts; to bind her heart to crystals of the earth and ensure that she see her ambitions realized, and see Aelnar take its place as the rightful ruler of everything the stars touch."
 aelnar.83.a:0 "For an eternity and a thousand more."
 
 aelnar.84.t:0 "Geàinne"
 aelnar.84.d:0 "Elissa looked at the ring bore before her with a quirked brow and a suspicious look in her eye, the thing was hardly remarkable by itself, save for the green glyphs that pulsated with a weak light which covered the sides of it. She inquired if this was really it.\n\n'Yes, great empress,' the sorcerer said, his head still bowed as he presented the ring on a velvet pillow.\nElissa warily took the ring in her hand, immediately noting its weight as it weighed far more than any ring she had worn prior, heavier than solid orbs of steel and entire bars of gold even. She inspected the ring, no doubt scrutinizing every detail before putting it on.\n\n'You,' she said, pointing to a ruinborn slave. The slave nodded to her in response, oddly finding her thoughts clouded, as if in a heavy mist.\n'Jump,' Elissa ordered, pointing to an open window in her throne room.\n\nWhen the slave's consciousness returned to her, she was already a third of the way to the ground."

 aelnar.86.t:0 "Defiant Proles"
 aelnar.86.d:0 "The provinces under the control of Aelthanas’s peasant hordes have become a hotbed of dissent. Swarms of well-wishers and opportunistic looters now flock to his banner, moving towards other districts at the behest of their low-class agitators. With the sway that Aelthanas holds over the commoners, there is no doubt that more would join him as he spreads his influence. We should move quickly to smother his "revolution" in its cradle before it spreads even to the capital."

What they lack in military training they make up for in sheer numbers, and they threaten to engulf the surrounding provinces in their degenerate crusade. Rumors abound of the zealots burning citizens at the stake for refusing conversion and even putting entire villages to the sword! We must put a stop to this, and end Dahvar and his cult!"

 aelnar.88.t:0 "Enchantment"
 aelnar.88.d:0 "Elissa's ambition was far from universally accepted among her peers. She was a visionary, after all, someone whose ideas were new and terrifying to those of smaller minds. We, however, will change that. With a cause so just as ours, there is little room for those plagued with things as trivial as fear or guilt. With this spell, cast from the very height of her great castle, we show our peoples the light of our ideas, the truth and goodness that is present in all things Elissa has promised us. Whether they know of her greatness or are unaware of her guiding light, all will know soon her truth, their hearts free of fear and their minds..."

 aelnar.89.t:0 "Illusion"
 aelnar.89.d:0 "The beauty we have returned to this land has made our people complacent, filled with a baseless assumption that we have surpassed the eternal glory of the empire that birthed us.\n\nThis is not even close to the truth. The cities of Aelantir were metropolitans where magic and technology blended together seamlessly with the everyday lives of our people, where our people flowed through an endless sea of magic, like fish in an endless crystal stream. Buildings big enough to house entire towns, institutions and libraries of knowledge older than the dragons, and zoos filled to the brim with one-of-a-kind specimens, all of this was lost forever in Ducaniel's weakness.\n\nAs we speak, a veil has been cast throughout the continent, showing our people the cities and fortresses that once were whenever they close their eyes, with even the most mundane of them far surpassing our capital's might in every conceivable way. This is the beauty that we have lost, we are but a cold shadow of what was once here, but not for long. We will retake these lands, and we will work to ensure these illusions will become reality."

 aelnar.90.t:0 "Divination"
 aelnar.90.d:0 "Glory be the Empress and all her wisdom! Our mages have spent many nights tracing the latent magical signals of the ruined earth for signs of the magic our precursors were famed for, searching every nook and cranny for a sign. Now they have come across something momentous, not only a reserve of precursor relics, but an entire site of our people's past, beautifully preserved and unmolested by undeserving wretches and the ravages of time."
 aelnar.90.a:0 "Glory!"
 
 aelnar.91.t:0 "Necromancy"
 aelnar.91.d:0 "Like the seasons, people pass. They grow, they prosper, they wither, then they die. We have already proven ourselves beyond the order of the earth, our magic allowing crops to be grown all year-round, why must we limit ourselves to the needs of then?\n\nElissa asked that question, and now she is eternal, beyond life and beyond death. With an immortal queen, we need an army to match our pedigree, to reflect the greatness of our nation. The answers come not from our own people, far too frail and weak-bodied for combat, even if they are the chosen people to rule above all else. The answer does not come from the realm of any living thing, but in the catacombs of our greatest fallen warriors. Unflinching, unyielding, and with immortality paled only by our own queen, these golden paragons of the past will serve us till the earth buckles under their eternal march."

 aelnar.93.t:0 "The Crystal Heart"
 aelnar.93.d:0 "Your ascension is but a formality, a new vessel for the eternal queen to impart her beauty and ambition upon. You sit within a crystalline hall, the mages of the realm chanting and scattering smoke and light in the air, if you were any weaker mind you'd have thought this was a ritual to summon a demon. Before you a mage enters through an arch leading to a chamber at the end of the hall, his face obscured in a crystalline mask that terminates into a headdress over a foot high. In his hand: a sacred relic, a heart of pure crystal.\n\n'It is time,' he says. Raising the heart into the air, which absorbs the enchanted mist of the still-chanting mage-priests. 'You are the future of our people now, you are the vessel upon which our Queen will live forever.'\n\nThe chanting of the priests grows louder, and ultimately you know your choice means nothing. The scattered lights of the room pour into the now-pulsing crystal heart, the pure energy of ten thousand ruinborn slaves now pulsing through the heart of the eternal queen. Your last thoughts are of your life leading up till then, and the comfort that it will all have lead to this."
 aelnar.93.a:0 "The future is Elissa, and Elissa is me."
 
 aelnar.94.t:0 "The Royal Courtesans"
 aelnar.94.d.a:0 "A lowborn servant of immense magical talent has found their way into the Favored Hundred, the royal harem. Such raw power is rare in one of a lower bloodline, and what's more, their mind for politics, economics, and history led the State to provide for their formal education. They now stand ready to serve as an adviser at court. Having been totally insulated from the political influence of the various factions, they can be trusted to provide a crucially unbiased view of the administration."
 aelnar.94.d.b:0 "The late-born scion of a noble military family has come to join the royal harem. As part of the Favored Hundred, they will no doubt have far more potential for true influence and power than in their past position as a sixth child. Their unfortunate prior position has become the Hundred's gain, as this one has obviously inherited far more of their ancestors' greatness than their elder siblings. The institution of the harem itself will gain great influence in the royal household thanks to this talented servant of the State, who has already attracted attention from the monarch for their military skill as much as the usual reasons."
 aelnar.94.d.c:0 "The Favored Hundred has attained great influence, moving from Elissa's mere harem to a loyal store of intellectual, political, and social power at the personal command of the monarch. This comes with new vulnerabilities, however. Two members of the Hundred, each of high standing in the court, have begun to let their personal grudges and rivalries spill over into the official administration of the state. Not only has this embarrassed the monarch, it has weakened day-to-day administration."
 aelnar.94.d.d:0 "There can be no doubt that Elissa is the greatest beauty among the stars. True greatness shines the most when put into contrast with itself. So it is with the new star of the court, a darling courtesan with beauty second only to that of Elissa herself. To be attended and waited on by this ethereal, otherworldly creature of near-perfection only drives home the useful splendor and opulence of Elissa's grand court. Why ought she fear rivals for her beauty when they could serve her instead?"
 aelnar.94.d.e:0 "As the one center of political and social gravity untainted by our society's deep patchwork of family grudges and rivalries, the Favored Hundred have attracted the attention and good will of much of the upper crust. Though they appear to be a loose collection of unrelated individuals, in reality the courtesans of the royal harem have become highly coordinated, working in deliberate concert to raise the prestige of both their own institution and the monarch personally."
 aelnar.94.d.f:0 "The courtesans of the Favored Hundred, having achieved considerable influence among the upper classes, have begun to develop more specific and concrete projects on which to spend their accumulated political capital. Unfortunately, this has opened up new fractures between the courtesans themselves, who seek different ends based on personal allegiance and interest. Two major factions have arisen, and as the Hundred have already become so intertwined with the state, we seem to have a situation in which parts of the government influenced by one faction would actively work against another. This required the personal intervention of the monarch, and the entire episode has undermined faith in the State."
 aelnar.94.d.g:0 "Due to the exalted place of the Favored Hundred in society, it is sometimes difficult to remember the royal harem's ostensible purpose: the provision of companions and servants to the monarch. Nevertheless, it still manages to perform this function admirably. Not only does the Hundred still excel at fulfilling the monarch's physical desires, courtesans have come to provide personal companionship and emotional support. One in particular has formed a particularly close bond with [Root.Monarch.GetName], and it seems they have lightened the burden of rulership."
 aelnar.94.d.h:0 "Through their many positions giving advice to the monarch and powerful ministers, courtesans of the Favored Hundred often have a close-up view of the practical business of administration. One particularly keen courtesan has made a number of helpful observations on how the every-day functioning of the State could be improved."
 aelnar.94.d.i:0 "When [Root.Monarch.GetName] attends the Court in the presence of the Favored Hundred, it is impossible not to be awestruck by the transcendent beauty of the assembled courtesans of the royal harem. It is as though dozens of the most beautiful people in the entire world have come to attend on the monarch. Their lavish devotion inspires a kind of mesmerizing effect in all those who witness it — as though such assembled beauty could only be tamed through a sort of earthly divinity. Our monarch's legitimacy has thus been cemented by the raw power of aesthetic preeminence."
 aelnar.94.d.j:0 "A position as a courtesan in the royal harem seems like a strange place for a grizzled veteran soldier to end up. However, a retiring soldier would no doubt be expected to take on the work of contributing to their family's ambitions — if one wants to avoid that, the Favored Hundred can seem like a particularly attractive destination. So it was with our newest courtesan, a talented but aging officer who has promised to take up the work of passing on their wisdom and discipline to the next generation of warriors."

 Z43_geainne_title:0 "Geàinne"
 Z43_geainne_desc:0 "The ease of controlling the connadh is not always as simple as ordering them to do as we will, their feeble minds can at times present a surprising amount of resistance to our whims. This cannot do, and it is exactly where our plans continue. The rings of such dense gold as to weigh like things fifteen times their size can be etched with the will of our mages and projected into the minds of our thralls to break their will and impose our own."
 Z43_connadh_transmutation_title:0 "Transmutation"
 Z43_connadh_transmutation_desc:0 "Though magic runs through our veins like blood, it is not enough to feed the needs of empire. This is a simple matter however, as our queen is more than capable of molding the earth to her grand design."
 Z43_connadh_enchantment_title:0 "Enchantment"
 Z43_connadh_enchantment_desc:0 "Fear is the chain that binds the minds our people to dissenting ideas, notions that will ultimately disrupt our greatest of ambitions and slow us down. Star elves must be beyond fear, beyond the foolish posturings and ideas of those who seek to destroy us before we can realize our destiny."
 Z43_connadh_illusion_title:0 "Illusion"
 Z43_connadh_illusion_desc:0 "It has been years since the we first came to this land, we were but adventurers then, only vaguely aware of this sacred land. Now that so much time has passed, many foolishly assume that we have recreated the empire that once ruled this all in its glory. They are small-minded and complacent, unaware of the true glory we have only managed to recreate a fraction of a fraction of."
 Z43_connadh_divination_title:0 "Divination"
 Z43_connadh_divination_desc:0 "Our mages have been at work peeking through the veil of obscurity and have come across something interesting: a beacon to a time lost long, long ago..."
 Z43_connadh_conjuration_title:0 "Conjuration"
 Z43_connadh_conjuration_desc:0 "We are not tyrants, nay. We are the liberators of our peoples, and the peace that we have promised, we have granted. Yet, some of us still suffer from the evils of poverty and crime, we cannot allow this to go on."
 Z43_connadh_necromancy_title:0 "Necromancy"
 Z43_connadh_necromancy_desc:0 "Though the zeal of our peoples in defending our rightfully promised gains is admirable, we can no longer function with clean conscience knowingly sending our people into the lines of those who may oppose us just to die. Instead, we - again - must look to the past for our solution."
 Z43_connadh_abjuration_title:0 "Abjuration"
 Z43_connadh_abjuration_desc:0 "The defense of our land is paramount to ensure our continued safety as the last surviving bastion of light in a world plunged in darkness. Evil is all around us, and we must act before it can even consider destroying us."
 Z43_connadh_evocation_title:0 "Evocation"
 Z43_connadh_evocation_desc:0 "It is done, the pieces are now in place. The mages that have poured inordinate amounts of blood, sweat, and tears for our cause now celebrate in their chambers for their momentous achievement. The age of darkness will end with a glorious dawn."

 Z43_by_the_south_title:0 "By The South"
 Z43_by_the_south_desc:0 "Dominion of all Aelantir is our birthright. Toward that end, let us prepare an invasion to attack Eordand from the south so that we can subjugate the ruinborn cities there and prevent them from challenging our dominion."
 Z43_by_the_north_title:0 "By The North"
 Z43_by_the_north_desc:0 "An expedition into the north will allow us to encircle the ruinborn population, making it only a matter of time until we are the masters of all Eordand."
 Z43_eordand_secrets_title:0 "Eordand Secrets"
 Z43_eordand_secrets_desc:0 "Our conquest of Eordand has cemented our rightful place as the rulers of our deformed ruinborn cousins. Now we may exercise our birthright and exploit these lands."
 Z43_prove_your_worth_title:0 "Prove Your Worth"
 Z43_prove_your_worth_desc:0 "As the inheritor of Sicrheior's legacy, our monarch will struggle to get out from under the late Emperor's shadow. To preserve the stability of the realm, it is imperative that our monarch demonstrate that this is a continuation of Sicrheior's greatness, rather than its end."
 Z43_strategic_mastermind_title:0 "Strategic Mastermind"
 Z43_strategic_mastermind_desc:0 "Sicrheior modernized elven military strategy and built an army worthy of Aelnar. To be a worthy successor, our monarch will need to prove that Sicrheior's strategic brilliance has passed to his heir."
 Z43_tactical_genius_title:0 "Tactical Genius"
 Z43_tactical_genius_desc:0 "Even more so than his strategic prowess, Sicrheior's tactical innovations set him apart from other famous elvish generals like Kayd. A worthy heir must be a master of the battlefield, not merely a master of the campaign."
 Z43_sicrheior_legacy_title:0 "Sicrheior Legacy"
 Z43_sicrheior_legacy_desc:0 "All of Aelnar now recognizes that Sicrheior's heir is worthy of the family name. The imperial dynasty founded by the great reformer will last after all."
 Z43_expert_generals_title:0 "Expert Generals"
 Z43_expert_generals_desc:0 "It was not so long ago that our military was a glorified militia, disorganized and deeply unprofessional. Now, the institutional knowledge of our army has advanced to such a degree that the next generation of great generals are ready to take the field."
 Z43_the_sicrheior_academy_title:0 "The Sicrheior Academy"
 Z43_the_sicrheior_academy_desc:0 "Traditionally, officers in elvish armies are chosen for the virtue, honor, and martial valor. While romantic and beautiful, this system is archaic and anachronistic. The construction of an academy where prospective officers undergo rigorous and formal training will go a long way toward creating an army of professional soldiers."
 Z43_a_new_constitution_title:0 "A New Constitution"
 Z43_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "Elven law is a tangled mess of tradition, norm, and custom. It is incredibly difficult simply to understand this political quagmire, let alone mobilize it to enact reform. Fortunately, Sicrheior's personal authority and influence have finally become secure enough to sweep away this backward system and rebuild Aelnar's government from the ground up with a simplified written constitution. This system will make the government more nimble and transparent."
 Z43_in_the_jungle_title:0 "In The Jungle"
 Z43_in_the_jungle_desc:0 "The jungles of Effalai present new challenges, being largely unfamiliar terrain that is difficult to penetrate. However, it is precisely this difficulty which makes it a priority. Conquest of Effalai will demonstrate the glory of the fully mobilized elven nation."
 Z43_united_coast_title:0 "United Coast"
 Z43_united_coast_desc:0 "The powers of Cannor and beyond must not be allowed to project power in defense of their squatter states. Control of the Dry and Severed Coasts will secure complete naval control of the homeland. Elvish ships on elvish waters!"
 Z43_independant_justice_title:0 "Independent Justice"
 Z43_independant_justice_desc:0 "It is imperative that the imperial reforms not simply provide a basis for the collapse into petty authoritarianism and strongman politics. Developing independent judicial bodies will ensure the preservation of Sicrheior's legal reforms and prevent the creeping virus of corruption from infecting the ship of state."
 Z43_sibhil_cad_title:0 "Sibhil Cad"
 Z43_sibhil_cad_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, elves of different social classes have been given different rights and been subject to different laws. Sicrheior's great modernization of Aelnar will end this practice, establishing a unified Sibhil Cad, or Code Civil."
 Z43_from_the_ground_up_title:0 "From The Ground Up"
 Z43_from_the_ground_up_desc:0 "Many military reforms focus on changing leadership, strategy, and tactics. Those are certainly important, and Sicrheior has made changes there, but central to his goal of reforming the military is working from the ground up to create ideal soldiers. Sicrheior's armies will be filled with well-trained, educated, and honorable elves."
 Z43_meritocratic_promotion_title:0 "Meritocratic Promotion"
 Z43_meritocratic_promotion_desc:0 "Elves typically place great importance on lineage, and so command positions have typically been handed to those from families with a long history of service. This leads to too many bright minds falling through the cracks, especially with the expansion of the army. Instead, promotion will now be on an entirely meritocratic basis, with command going only to the most capable."
 Z43_aentories_title:0 "Aentories"
 Z43_aentories_desc:0 "Aentories, or auxiliaries, are corps of human and ruinborn soldiers. Those less magnanimous than Sicrheior may be wary of fully mobilizing these populations, but the Emperor understands that offering citizenship in exchange for service will ensure the loyalty of Aelnar's non-elven subjects. They will, of course, still be barred from holding high political or command positions, but they will have the legal and economic rights of citizens after a mere 25 years of service."
 Z43_inor_ameor_title:0 "Inor Ameor"
 Z43_inor_ameor_desc:0 "In the past, elvish armies were seen as collections of nobles doing their best to win personal glory for themselves and their families. Sicrheior has ended this by building the Inor Ameor, or Grand Army, in which every soldier and officer is dedicated to the pursuit of the success of the army and the glorification of the Nation rather than their own petty legacy."
 Z43_art_of_logistic_title:0 "Art of Logistics"
 Z43_art_of_logistic_desc:0 "Though brilliant, Sicrheior cannot manage the military by himself, and must rely on his officers. In order to ensure they have the best chance of success possible, Sicrheior has written and distributed the 'Art of Logistics', an elegant treatise on his conception of war as an endeavor primarily about supply chains. All good defense is built around protecting lines of supply, and all good offense is built around attacking the same. Military genius flows from these simple principles."
 Z43_first_corps_title:0 "The Division Ynn"
 Z43_first_corps_desc:0 "Supplementing the main imperial army, Sicrheior pioneered semi-autonomous 'Divisions' to harness the power of the pathfinders, scouts, and adventurers created by the hardships of the settlement."
 Z43_second_corps_title:0 "The Division Eordand"
 Z43_second_corps_desc:0 "As the Division system grew, it conveniently solved the problem of glory-hungry warriors who could not be effectively melded into the Inor Ameor."
 Z43_third_corps_title:0 "The Division Endralliande"
 Z43_third_corps_desc:0 "Though originally known for their land operations in the interior of Aelantir, the legacy of the Divisions would eventually become defined by their exploits as flexible marine companies that were central to Sicrheior's control of Aelantir's many islands."
 Z43_fourth_corps_title:0 "The Division Aelnar"
 Z43_fourth_corps_desc:0 "By the time Sicrheior completed his conquests of Aelantir, the divisions had become heavily romanticized and were the frequent subject of literature and art. This drove heavy recruitment, and it was said that the soldiers of the Divisions were 'paid thrice in honor, and only once in gold.'"
 Z43_under_one_star_title:0 "Under One Star"
