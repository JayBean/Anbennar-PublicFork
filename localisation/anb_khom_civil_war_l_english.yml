 khom_civilwar.1.t:0 "The Young Emperor"
 khom_civilwar.1.d:0 "Caoban Dinh, rightful heir to the great empire of Baihon Xinh, glances out window at the pristine High Temples of Ma Hoang. Loud chatter fills the room while he recalls the past months.\n\nHis father had called him and his two older brothers to a grand banquet, something seen as the last chance they’d have to be merry as family before his father passed and the brothers were forced to become enemies. In truth, however, the Emperor had other motives, as demonstrated when armed men filtered into the room and arrested the three brothers. The Emperor’s spies had found out about the brothers’ plans to split his lands after his death, and the Emperor was enraged. So consumed by rage was the Emperor, that he ordered the execution of his sons without a thought to the consequences. Still, it seems the Emperor could not bear to watch over his childrens’ deaths, and the Emperor left their execution to one of his subordinates. As the heads left the bodies of his brothers, Dinh talked quickly, pleading for the executioner to spare his life and making promises of rewards. His silver tongue seemed to convince the man, as he released Dinh and promised to tell the Emperor that he was dead. He set out northward alone on horseback where the Phonan people hid him from the eyes of the Emperor and promised him support when they heard his story.\n\nWeeks passed with silence on the part of the Emperor, an opportunity Dinh did not let slip. The many connections he had made in preparation for the succession struggle paid dividends and already a great army was gathering in Ma Hoang to depose the mad emperor. However, before they could march south, terrible news arrived; Emperor Caoban Sang now sits upon his throne neither alive nor dead and rumors abound that the glorious capital of Tuan Caoban is beset by foul spirits born of the Emperor’s madness.\n\nCaoban Dinh focuses back on the room. Around a large table, men sit discussing the last preparations made for war. He looks around, seeing the ambassador of the Kudet Kai, amongst the plethora of others who have tied their fate to his and contributed their wealth to his cause. The time for talking is over; now is the time for war!\n\n§RIn order to win, achieve total victory and take the§! §GAssert Our Claim§! §Rpeace option.§!"

 khom_civilwar.2.t:0 "The Ghost of An Empire"
 khom_civilwar.2.d:0 "During the life of Caoban Sang, Emperor of the Baihon Xinh, the palace had been full of supplicant foreign emissaries, loyal nobles, and most dear of all, his three lively sons. Now the halls are empty but for the specter atop the throne.\n\nIn the months prior, his spies had uncovered a plot between his sons to split the empire in three upon his death. Sang was a learned man, and knew that this would plunge Baihon Xinh, already weakened from the loss of its economic center to a pirate incursion, into yet another period of warlords. One from which it may never escape. Seeing no other option, Sang made a very hard choice. The lives of his sons were a heavy price, but a worthy sacrifice to preserve unity. \n\nSummons were sent out to his sons for a grand banquet in Tuan Caoban, a final farewell from father to sons; just not the way they would expect. When the feast was wrapping up, Sang excused himself, for he could not bear to witness the deed being done. Although this deed would avert a future of strife, it was also true that it left Sang heirless. Even if he did manage to sire one in what little time he had left, there was no chance he could give them a proper upbringing. He needed more time. Calling his most loyal mystics to a meeting in secret, they arrived at a solution to this problem, an ancient ritual brought from Bomdan long ago. A thorough cleansing of the body, the lighting of a special incense, a ritual knife infused with magical energies, and an unshakable will to live on.\n\nA month passed before Sang awoke again, now an ephemeral being of righteous fury. No longer shackled by the limits of a mortal body, he could bring about an empire to last another thousand years. Unfortunately, fate saw to it that he was enlightened with the fact that great things never happen so easily. During his absence it was uncovered that the executioners had let his youngest son, Dinh, escape his fate. Dinh had fled to the northern city of Ma Hoang and was already rallying an army to take Tuan Caoban. Apparently Dinh had made extensive connections within the administration of the empire and many nobles were flocking to his cause. In the frenzy that followed this revelation, another blow had arrived. The puppet king of Nagon to the west had raised his own army and declared independence, knowing that we could not afford to contest his insubordination.\n\nNo matter; Caoban Sang had not conquered death to give up now. Now is the time to call upon our remaining ally, the warrior women of Chien Binhrung, for war against the last of his flesh.\n\n§RIn order to win, achieve total victory and take the§! §GDefend Our Legacy§! §Rpeace option.§!"

 khom_civilwar.3.t:0 "The Stone Kai"
 khom_civilwar.3.d:0 "Mere decades ago, Kudet Kai sat at the brink of destruction at the hands of the barbarous Binhrung. Our shared overlord, Emperor Caoban Sang of Baihon Xinh, refused to even hear our protests, seemingly content with the oppression of our people. The siege of Nirakvonkai was only broken through the bravery of now lord Pulutan and his band of warriors.\n\nOur people have thus far been forced to begrudge this mistreatment, but now things have changed; Baihon Xinh is no more and Caoban Sang’s empire has collapsed into total civil war. In a fit of madness, Sang murdered his sons and wielded dark magics to live on after death, but one son escaped. Caoban Dinh stands at the head of a revolt to depose the wraith wearing an emperor's garb, but he faces stiff resistance in the shameless Chien Binhrung, who have decided to align themselves with evil. We must stand by Dinh in his struggle, for there is nothing for us in Sang’s future but suffering.\n\n§GShould Ma Hoang achieve total victory, we will drive Chien Binhrung back into the jungle.§!"

 khom_civilwar.4.t:0 "The Crystal Kai"
 khom_civilwar.4.d:0 "Chien Binhrung and Kudet Kai were once united in rule over Thidinkai, but after a devastating war that left both our rulers dead, the soldiers of Kudet Kai carelessly cremated our queen’s body in an act of treachery and total disregard for our customs. A few decades ago we came close to avenging this tragedy and bringing an end to their rule, but were thwarted by a particularly clever Harimari mercenary whom they have now elected lord.\n\nNow we find ourselves at a turning point of history. The empire of Baihon Xinh, who formerly claimed dominion over us, is no more and Thidinkai plunges into another era of warlords. Emperor Caoban Sang was betrayed by his sons and so was forced to kill them, but one of them survived and now stands in open rebellion. Already, our spies have discovered evidence of correspondence between the pretender and the tiger lord of Kudet Kai. Against all reason there was silence on the part of Emperor Sang, but all was soon to be revealed.\n\nSang, seeing no other way to protect his people in his advanced age, performed secret magics to live on in spirit form. It would be hypocritical of us to denounce this action, for is it not similar to our veneration of the Crystal Queens? One of the first acts after his rebirth was a message to us, promising us territory from Kudet Kai should we assist him in putting down the traitors. Since it would seem the pretender has made the same promise to our rival, we’re left with little choice but to fight.\n\n§GShould Hon Sai achieve total victory, we will cut Kudet Kai off from the sea and seize their heartlands.§!"

 khom_civilwar.10.d:0 "Today a messenger has arrived outside our hold, claiming to represent the true ruler of Baihon Xinh, temporarily residing in Ma Hoang. The man says that Caoban Dinh has been forced to take up arms against the madness of the old emperor, who seeks to rule even after death. Many in the hold still begrudge the extortionate tributes the old emperor levied to fuel his endless military campaigns and see this as a chance to put a ruler on the throne that will feel indebted to us.\n\nAs the conversation was concluding, the man let slip that he is here on his own initiative, so it would seem it is ultimately on us to reach out to this pretender."

Already a grand army has been assembled in our capital, though it would have been considered small in our glory days. The border garrisons have been weakened to dangerous levels, and nearly every fighting man in the nation is prepared to fight to get help for our land.

Few managed to escape the Wraith Emperor’s Palace, as it has come to be called, but they all share a story that belongs better in nightmares. Tuan Caoban has become a city paralyzed by fear, breaths held in anxious anticipation for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to act and end the torment of the living and dead within its walls. Through careful consultation with numerous exorcists and spirit hunters, a ritual has been devised to banish the fell spirit. A ritual in which the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] shall play a central role.\n\nLate in the afternoon, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], accompanied by numerous skilled exorcists and veteran spirit hunters, enters the palace.
