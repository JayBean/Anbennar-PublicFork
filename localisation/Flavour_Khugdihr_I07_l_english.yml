    khugdihr_secure_the_north_title:0 "Secure the North"
    khugdihr_secure_the_north_desc:0 "Nestled between the lonely mountains and the Western Serpentspine lies the Dwaroval, and then the Northern Pass. To protect our economic interests in the area we should divert our resources from the dwarven caverns and tunnels to the pass so that no one else can take it from us, especially not the gray orcs of Frozenmaw."
    
    khugdihr_balgar_venerated_ancestor_title:0 "Balgar, our Ancestor"
    khugdihr_balgar_venerated_ancestor_desc:0 "Khugdihr was once home to the stone dwarf Balgar the Builder, who devised the legendary white walls of Castanor and who built the Dragonforge in the City of Stone. We should stand up to our ancestors and revoke his exile so that he can return to Khugdihr and lay the groundwork our nation needs."
    
    khugdihr_alliance_of_faith_title:0 "Alliance of Faith"
    khugdihr_alliance_of_faith_desc:0 "Balgar the Builder. His name holds both historic and religious weight in Cannor and the Dwarovar. A legendary architect and engineer, his techniques are taught by our ancestor-venerating kin of the Serpentspine despite his exile from our hold, Khugdihr, and the Balgarsmiths of the Regent Court style him in the mantle of a god. It is through this two-fold worship that we might be able to reconcile our religious differences with our estranged brethren."
    
    khugdihr_the_ancestral_holds_title:0 "The Ancestral Holds"
    khugdihr_the_ancestral_holds_desc:0 "In the days of yore, before the last days of Aul Dwarov, the seat of power was Amldihr, the mighty hold of the High King. Beyond the Serpentsvale lay Er-Natvir, the heart of commerce in the ancient dwarven empire. These two holds have long cemented dwarven rule into the Serpentspine, but since the fall they are but shadows of their former selves. If they are to be restored to their former glory we must invite those who know of our ancestral ways into these holds."
    
    
    
    khugdihr_the_asra_bank_title:0 "The Asra Bank"
    khugdihr_the_asra_bank_desc:0 "Fognir Asra has become a legendary name among the cartels and merchant guilds of Cannor. He is the founder of the renowned (and influential) Asra Bank, a continent-spanning corporation. It is also he who funded multiple adventurers going into the Serpentspine – the Dwarovar – the ancestral home of all dwarves. Since these expeditions have been funded, we have settled into one of the holds, Khugdihr, and made it our home. It is now time to report back to him since this is the closest he and his clan have to their ancestral home, the hold of Ovdal Asra."
    
    khugdihr_funding_the_reconquest_title:0 "Funding the Reconquest"
    khugdihr_funding_the_reconquest_desc:0 "To retake the Serpentspine in the name of Aul Dwarov has been a dream of our people for centuries, but never was it closer to reality than now. With the possibility of a restored dwarven Serpentspine on the horizon, we must divert resources from the Banks and Cartels to this reclamation effort, so that our reconquest will be successful."
    
    khugdihr_follow_the_dwarven_rail_road_title:0 "Follow the Dagrite Road"
    khugdihr_follow_the_dwarven_rail_road_desc:0 "If Er-Natvir was the heart of Aul-Dwarov, then the Dagrite Roads are the veins. They span the entire Serpentspine and along them we must follow to see the riches that lie in wait, from the halls of Haraz Orldhûm, along the mithril forges of Mithradhûm to the Kingsrock and the Railyard: They will be part of Khugdihr."
    
    khugdihr_industrial_dwarovar_title:0 "Industrial Dwarovar"
    khugdihr_industrial_dwarovar_desc:0 "It lies in the nature of dwarvenkind to forge, to shape, to build. But even our natural instinct can be incentivised. By further increasing production in our holds, we can make sure that the foundries of Haraz Orldhûm and Mithradhûm will not cease to supply our endeavours."
    
    
    
    khugdihr_anbenncoster_contacts_title:0 "Anbenncóster Contacts"
    khugdihr_anbenncoster_contacts_desc:0 "When Fognir Asra founded the Asra Bank it was clear he would choose the City of World's Desire, Anbenncóst, as the place for the headquarters. The economic, political, and societal incentives were just too strong to ignore the possibility. But now his expedition has succeeded and Khugdihr has been reclaimed in his name. It seems prudent, then, that we should send a delegation to the bank, requesting personnel to further the bank's interest in the region."
    
    khugdihr_investor_dividends_and_future_incentives_title:0 "Investor Dividends"
    khugdihr_investor_dividends_and_future_incentives_desc:0 "With production well underway, a secure treasury, and a well-oiled bureaucracy, it is now time to give our sponsors – the Asra Bank first and foremost – a return on their investment. Along with their dividends, we will send them proof of our bookkeeping and some spare paper to boot."
    
    khugdihr_allowing_bank_influence_title:0 "Allowing Bank Influence"
    khugdihr_allowing_bank_influence_desc:0 " One of the most important matters of our state is the constant flow of money. Luckily we are keeping good relations with our main sponsor, but a new idea has been proposed to our ruler: by offering the bank business incentives and special privileges in our state, in exchange for monetary investments, we could ensure that we will maintain a steady stream of outside funding. In the short term, this might not be the wisest decision, but we will weather it and emerge from the storm as a more successful state."
    
    khugdihr_nationalising_the_bank_title:0 "Nationalising the Bank"
    khugdihr_nationalising_the_bank_desc:0 " The Asra Bank has us in their clutches, and we are run more like a corporation than an actual nation-state. On the other hand, the bank is now run more like a state than a bank. To secure our financial stability we should reverse our relationship and nationalise the bank. This should also ensure that Clan Asra's interest in Khugdihr solidifies and that their personal attention rests primarily on us. Once Fognir himself arrives we shall surprise him with something he won't expect..."
    
    khugdihr_successors_of_asra_title:0 "Successors of Asra"
    khugdihr_successors_of_asra_desc:0 "The legends speak of Ovdal Asra with veneration, a great hold like few others. Whether these are tall tales told by bards and their like, or whether there is some truth to them remains debatable, but one thing is certain: Asra was influential, to the point where it was represented by one of the dwarovkron's seven gems, and Khugdihr always had close ties to it as its sister-hold. But Ovdal Asra was found and promptly lost once again in 1410 after Fognir and his companions collapsed it to prevent an orcish invasion of Khugdihr, so Khugdihr is all that is left. Invested in us lies the history of our hold, the belief in a once-great empire, and the trust of the last of Clan Asra, Fognir. Are we not the successors of Asra then?"
    

    
    khugdihr_foreign_investment_title:0 "Foreign Investment"
    khugdihr_foreign_investment_desc:0 "Khugdihr lies at the border between the Serpentspine and Cannor, and has had a monopoly on trade between the two continents ever since the Marrhold Connector, the only other way into the mountains, caved in. Because of this position, many foreigners are interested in us. These connections will give us an upper hand in most diplomatic forays, and, more importantly, will keep Cannor investing in us. The time has come to send out delegations to Cannor and secure aid."
    
    khugdihr_dwarven_aid_title:0 "Dwarven Aid"
    khugdihr_dwarven_aid_desc:0 "We are not alone in this world, and that is for the best. With our grip over Khugdihr established we can now reach out to our kin in Cannor, the dwarves of Rubyhold and Silverforge. Many dwarves there are eager to depart to the Serpentspine in search of glory, gold and... friendship? Whatever they want, if we can channel them through Khugdihr, we can speed up our own reclamation effort."
    
    khugdihr_anbennarian_aid_title:0 "Anbennarian Aid"
    khugdihr_anbennarian_aid_desc:0 "If there is one entity dominating Cannor, then it must be Anbennar. The sprawling empire around the Dameshead offers bountiful resources, which could also benefit us. If possible, we should get Anbennarians to settle in Khugdihr, which would not only increase our political standing but also bring in foreign talent."
    
    khugdihr_gnomish_aid_title:0 "Gnomish Aid"
    khugdihr_gnomish_aid_desc:0 "Among the people of Halann none compare in craftiness and tinkering to our small-bodied fellows, the gnomes. Far away on the Dragon Coast, on the other side of Cannor, they have built an empire of ages past, just as we once had. It is now time to work together so that at least we can forge our empire anew. With gnomes in our capital we might just get the mechanical expertise we need – after all, was it not the gnomish tinkerer Mintbrick Puddlebonk who went into Ovdal Asra alongside Fognir Asra, and was it not him who managed to activate the golems to defeat the orcs?"
    
    khugdihr_a_cannorian_hold_title:0 "A Cannorian Hold"
    khugdihr_a_cannorian_hold_desc:0 "It is in the nature of the Serpentspine to be a secluded, isolationist place, but that is not the path we wish to follow down. We should not look inwards, but outwards, towards the world and all of its riches. Now that most of Cannor has some amount of ''shares'' in our hold, we have become a truly international enterprise, just like the bank which sponsored us in the first place."
    
    
    
    khugdihr_sponsor_the_reclamation_effort_title:0 "Sponsor the Reclamation"
    khugdihr_sponsor_the_reclamation_effort_desc:0 "With Khugdihr's position at the entrance of the Serpentspine cemented we have the ability to channel the funds from foreign lands to whatever purpose we see fit. Not only are there other expeditions sent by the Asra Bank, but also opportunistic groups of adventurers from all over the world. We can supply them with the needed funds, and we benefit from our diplomatic approach being made public."
    
    khugdihr_a_natural_ally_title:0 "A Natural Ally"
    khugdihr_a_natural_ally_desc:0 "Balgar the Builder was a stone dwarf, a dwarf without clan, without allegiance. Now we hear that a group of stone dwarves have arrived in Escann, and naturally, these dwarves could be a great asset to us. We should make sure that we keep this alliance, no matter whether they succeed in creating a nation for themselves in Escann or not."
    
    khugdihr_securing_regional_stability_title:0 "Securing Stability"
    khugdihr_securing_regional_stability_desc:0 "Our alliance with the Escanni dwarves cemented, we can start combating the orcish hordes at our doorstep so that the traders from far and wide do not have to fear any orcish bandits."
    
    khugdihr_cannorian_dwarovar_exchange_treaty_title:0 "Cannorian Exchange"
    khugdihr_cannorian_dwarovar_exchange_treaty_desc:0 "The dwarves of yore were used to life underground, a sunless life without the luxuries of the surface. But we are not the dwarves from ancient times; indeed, most of us were born on the surface. We desire grain and bread, honey and mead, and even the halfling's leaf. In exchange for these goods, we part with the riches of the Serpentspine, rare metals and gems that have never seen the light of day before."
    
    
    
    khugdihr_asra_a_lead_title:0 "Asra: A Lead"
    khugdihr_asra_a_lead_desc:0 "The legend of Fognir Asra's expedition to his ancestral home, Ovdal Asra, has been retold often, with each retelling making the tale greater-er and legendary-er. But now we have come upon the possibility to learn about what really happened in 1410 AA, when Fognir himself laid ruin to the Hold."
    
    khugdihr_the_search_for_mintbrick_title:0 "The Search for Mintbrick"
    khugdihr_the_search_for_mintbrick_desc:0 "One of the six companions of Fognir was the gnome Mintbrick Puddlebonk, an expert on the Dwarovar and one of the foremost artificers of his time. When we noticed strange golem activity near the site where Fognir lost sight of him, we dispatched a rescue and recovery group, however it is more likely that this will be recovery group, rather than rescue."
    
    khugdihr_gnomish_insight_title:0 "Gnomish Insight"
    khugdihr_gnomish_insight_desc:0 "When Mintbrick laid waste to the orcish horde camped in Asra, it was not by his bravery, but by his understanding of the dwarven golems he commanded, an understanding none of his peers had. We might not see a tinkerer of similar renown in our ranks again, but since our dwarven scholars have failed to repair the golem, it might be prudent to trust the gnomes with this matter once again."
    
    khugdihr_repair_the_golem_title:0 "Repair the Golem"
    khugdihr_repair_the_golem_desc:0 "The gnomes of Khugdihr were ecstatic to take up the work of their peer Mintbrick and with them, the other artificers of our newly established cadre started toiling at the golem for days on end. Their tedious work was worth its time, though, as after a particularly exhausting day of calibration the golem sprang to life, whizzing and whirling, but working nonetheless."
    
    khugdihr_asra_sunk_cost_fallacy_title:0 "Asra: Sunk Cost Fallacy"
    khugdihr_asra_sunk_cost_fallacy_desc:0 "The Sunk Cost Fallacy, so Fognir has told often, is one of the seventeen classic blunders of a banker. By investing resources into a project or endeavour that has long outlasted its profitability we sabotage ourselves. It is vital for businesses to recognize when it is time to stop."
    
    
    
    khugdihr_finish_western_conquest_title:0 "Consolidate the Region"
    khugdihr_finish_western_conquest_desc:0 "We should finish our consolidation of the western Serpentspine, especially the three holds of Amldihr, Orlazam-az-dihr and Dûr-Vazhatun. This way our interests in the region will be secured for generations to come."
    
    khugdihr_securing_the_capital_title:0 "Securing the Capital"
    khugdihr_securing_the_capital_desc:0 "Khugdihr is an open hold: open for all traders, merchants, craftsmen, and investors. This means that our entrances stand unprotected against those that wish to destroy Khugdihr once again, just like in 1424, when the greentide was unleashed out of the very doors through which we do our trade. We need to ensure that our defensive capabilities are up to modern standards, or we might just suffer the calamity of 1424 once again."
    
    khugdihr_sponsor_the_artificers_title:0 "Sponsor the Artificers"
    khugdihr_sponsor_the_artificers_desc:0 " It is time to face the truth: In order to unlock the secrets of the golem we have found alongside Mintbrick, we need more than just a single genius: we need an institution of artificers who work on this project in a coordinated way. Once Cognita's secrets are revealed we might even put their minds to other, more mundane uses."
    
    khugdihr_the_new_headquarters_title:0 "The New Headquarters"
    khugdihr_the_new_headquarters_desc:0 "After Fognir and his daughter became permanent residents, and his daughter ruler of Khugdihr, bank interests have become mostly centralised around our hold. It seems to be but a formality to move the global Asra Bank Headquarters from Anbenncóst to Khugdihr."
    
    khugdihr_experiments_in_golems_title:0 "Experiments in Golems"
    khugdihr_experiments_in_golems_desc:0 " Deep within the mechanical memory of Cognita lie secrets in wait that go beyond our wildest expectations: Among the data crystals and runic drives are plans, plans on how to construct golems of Aul-Dwarov. If we can decipher these memories we might just be able to put them to use to create our own version of them."
    
    
    
    khugdihr_the_banker_clans_title:0 "The Banker Clans"
    khugdihr_the_banker_clans_desc:0 "The Asra Bank is not a single entity, and never was. Fognir founded it from a collection of smaller cartels; a semi-unified corporation of banking clans under the lead and tutelage of Fognir. These clans each have their own investments in Khugdihr, and now we can invite them into our hold so that our communication will be less prone to transmission errors, thereby reducing internal struggles over missing signatures, overdue loans, and corporate direction."
    
    khugdihr_invest_in_the_holds_title:0 "Invest in the Holds"
    khugdihr_invest_in_the_holds_desc:0 "When we founded Khugdihr anew we spent considerable resources on its restoration, but not all holds have been given this amount of attention. Among our new holdings across the Serpentspine the dwarven fortresses lie in half-crumbling ruins, which we need to address."
    
    khugdihr_reconciliation_with_the_bank_title:0 "Reconciliation with the Bank"
    khugdihr_reconciliation_with_the_bank_desc:0 "Khugdihr and the Asra Bank are intertwined. From our history as an expedition to the coronation of clan Asra, we should not forget who we are."

    khugdihr_buying_out_the_shareholders_desc:0 "The time has come for us to strike: we have acquired enough crowns to buy out the shareholders of the Asra Bank so that we can be in full control of its businesses and proceedings."
    
    khugdihr_dwarvonomics_title:0 "Dwarvonomics"
    khugdihr_dwarvonomics_desc:0 "It was to be expected that the rest of the world would be intimidated by our grab for power regarding the Asra Bank. Investors are hesitant regarding the uncertain future of the bank, a situation which, if not addressed immediately, can snowball into a financial crisis. We need to convince our investors that the Asra Bank is still the trustworthy entity it always was, just under new management."
    
    khugdihr_the_face_of_the_reclamation_title:0 "Face of the Reclamation"
    khugdihr_the_face_of_the_reclamation_desc:0 "We stand proudly at the entrance of the Serpentspine, the champions of the reclamation of Aul-Dwarov. When the people of the west think about the dwarves returning to the forges of the Dwarovar they think of us first and foremost, a rightful position. We are the face and beating heart of this monumental effort."

    khugdihr_balgar_ascended_god_desc:0 "Over the decades Balgar has led us to great fortune, prestige, and power. We, and not the Balgarsmiths in Silverforge, are the true champions of Balgar, and his gaze lies upon us. We must revere him as more than just a god of builders but as our patron."

    khugdihr_balgars_masterpiece_desc:0 "Castonath, the City of Stone, Heart of Castanor, centre of Escann. It is Balgar's masterpiece, his greatest achievement. As such we should lay claim to it as Balgar's inheritors upon this earth. Castonath must belong to its rightful heir."

    khugdihr_securing_serpentspine_monopoly_desc:0 "Long have we had a monopoly over trade in the Serpentspine. In that time we have pushed and budged, argued and agreed, but those times are over.

    khugdihr_the_marrhold_connection_desc:0 "Marrhold is a strange hold, built by dwarves, but abandoned since time immemorial. It has since been repopulated by Alenic refugees seeking shelter from the Dragonwake. No dwarf lives there, so its intricate architecture has long ceased to be taken care of. It casts a shadow upon us; it is a sore thumb on our side. We need to address this situation as soon as possible."

They are of Balgar's clan, and we are his champions.

This was in part what caused his exile from Khugdihr, which started his journey to Escann, where he built Castonath and the White Walls of Castanor. After his death, he ascended to godhood, becoming a patron of builders and craftsmen. It is now time for us to revoke his exile and welcome him back to Khugdihr. \n\nThe ceremony was grand and magnificent, befitting Balgar's radiant craftsdwarfship. The members of our clergy, headed by our High Priest, walked along the newly named Balgar Avenue, from the gates of Khugdihr to the central temple. Once there, he held Balgar's holy sign high above his head. He ceremoniously placed it on the central altar with the following words: ''Ghôdi Balgar, vendan in verkal, Khugdihr thenkun ârtukor'' – ''Balgar, our God, return to your home, and receive Khugdihr's thanks.''"

This way, we reason, the bank sits at the perfect position to further expand in the Serpentspine, where yet untouched riches wait for the taking, and mighty economies just wait to be resurrected again. \n\nThis also means, obviously, that Clan Asra, of Ovdal Asra, will return to Khugdihr, their home after the fall of their own hold. Fognir had long left once Khugdihr was devastated in 1424, giving way to the Greentide that destroyed Escann, but now he is free to return to his less ancestral, but still old, home."

In a quiet manner [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stated [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] proposal: Fognir shall assume rule over Khugdihr as the new monarch, thus elevating Khugdihr to the place Ovdal Asra once had in the Serpentspine.

A great, self-sufficient fund has been set aside that will sponsor all reclaimers.

It is now time to take this alliance to the next level, to tie our countries together, even closer than before.\n\nThere are, however, two ways of going about this step: Gunra Stoneseeker, an expert on modern Escanni history and politics, suggests a decentralised agreement, a way for both countries to act independently, while Duran Gemcutter, a recent hire to our administrative department, has suggested using our influence as heirs to Ovdal Asra to form a union under our leadership – an irresistible offer to Hammerhome, as he puts it."

When he gets to the discovery of the gem and the subsequent orc horde, he goes quiet. ''That was when Mintbrick, well, decided to stay behind. He had found this army of golems, convinced he could defeat the orcs.'' He breathes heavily. ''I mean, it worked, but I have not seen him ever since...'' \n\nWith this new information, we can now gather an expedition that might lead us to the place Mintbrick fell. Fognir insinuates that Mintbrick must be long dead by now, which is reasonable, but he might still have left us, or specifically Fognir, something.

Among the events she tells of, she puts particular weight behind the sacrifice of Mintbrick Puddlebonk, the gnomish artificer.

It is now beyond any doubt that Fognir was right. Mintbrick is dead. He fell, valiantly, from the looks of it; but in the end, he fell. The only thing strange about this situation is the sole remainder of the slaughter: A golem, unlike the others: a golem that is bashed, bruised, and broken, but there seems to be no major damage to all essential structures, especially the memory banks.

Despite the numerous coordinates and trading routes that Cognita had stored within its mechanical mind, the countless paths to the old farms and pumping stations that kept the hold clean, this lead has yielded nothing.\n\nThe engineers agree: Back to the drawing board. Much of the data has been corrupted over time, through wear and tear, so what we have found for now might not have been everything. The whole picture has not been restored yet. It is possible, the golemancers agree, that there is some deeper key to the puzzle, hidden away in the most degraded parts of the memory banks."

Even the mages of our country have started to voice some theories and opinions, an insight that, while unasked for, has helped greatly. After days of tinkering the first results come in. Full functionality has been returned to the lower sectors, while the memory banks have been repaired almost completely.\n\nAs the days go by we receive more and more reports about the tremendous success of our venture. Then finally comes the much-anticipated message: ''Full functionality restored. Awaiting further orders.'' The answer to that question is quick and obvious: have Cognita return to its home coordinates. If that is possible, we may be able to find the legendary Ovdal Asra once again."
