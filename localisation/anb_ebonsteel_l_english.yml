 ebonsteel_events.1.t:0 "Ebonsteel Runic Focus"
 ebonsteel_events.1.d:0 "From the earth an unremarkable black rock, from the fire a metal dark as the night, and with the spoken word a true identity revealed. What was once ordinary, now is powerful. The true power of Ebonsteel is to resist failure; incoming blows are blocked by the metal's innate desire to remain untouched. Many heroes in Gerudian history have sworn by a plate of Ebonsteel for their resilience. Yet there is another identity yet unspoken for in Ebonsteel.\n\nIn ancient times, the Ebonsteel was crafted individually, with every piece given a different tale to imbue it with unique power. The modern rediscovering of the forging of Ebonsteel has lost this individuality, depending on a set list of litanies to be recited to unlock its magical properties. And while it may be possible to achieve the way of our ancestors once more, what has been achieved now is something of a useful compromise. Some of the latent properties of Ebonsteel can be re-awakened during their forging with a new mix of recited tales. However, this awakening of properties has a strange side effect: all Ebonsteel armaments already mass-forged with our already established Skaldic songs will be overwritten with the newer ones, and from then will remain stubbornly unchangeable in their identity.\n\nThe old identities that have resurfaced are old, yet have changed over the years in their own ways. Skaldic Fire was once imbued into weapons to give the gift of burning flame with each blow, but now can be delivered from afar with Ebonsteel firearms. The Fire that sustains Gerudia from the endless winter can now not only burn our enemies, but also shield us from their own missiles, burning them away into embers. The Einherjar Essence taps into the power of all our past heroes, not only our immediate ancestors. While empowered by the Einherjar, each swing is masterfully swung and each blow absorbed by supernatural guidance... and with every wound inflicted by the Ebonsteel weapon, the dread grows in the minds of the enemy with the wrath of centuries of Gerudian heroes."

 ebonsteel_events.2.t:0 "Ebonsteel Infantry"
 ebonsteel_events.2.d:0 "The past is something much looked back to in Gerudia; nostalgia for better times, when we were feared across the seas of Halann, when every coastline could face our Reavers and entire realms forged in our image from their weakness. Our cold and meagre lands forged strength, and rewarded our ancestors with Ebonsteel. This mythical metal, at first a mundane black with the faintest of purple sheen, was reforged and awoken with the power of the Skaldic songs. Many of our greatest heroes wielded such weapons and armor of Ebonsteel, yet even in their time the secrets of forging Ebonsteel were almost gone. Once the forges of Urviksten and Blodfjell ran red and full of song, yet our ancestors lost their greatest gift through the strife and shame. The art of forging Ebonsteel, and unlocking its true power, has been forgotten."

 enhance_ebonsteel_regiments_desc:0 "While the art of forging Ebonsteel has been practiced throughout Gerudia since its restoration, until now the magic enchanted onto the metal has been only rudimentary compared to the marvels of the ancients. It is to be expected that the Ebonsteel forged for our armies would be of lower quality than that of mastercrafted weapons of legend. But what if we can unlock the greater repellant magical properties in far less time and effort than is required for a masterwork? By Skald, artificer, scholar, or even mad-witch, no expense should be spared to unlock Ebonsteel’s true potential!"

 rediscover_ebonforging_desc:0 "Since Elkaesal blanketed Gerudia in the all-ending winter of the Era of Frost, the art of forging Ebonsteel has all been dormant. A dark metal with a slight sheen of deepest purple, Ebonsteel was admired by our ancestors for its wondrous property: a magical barrier that can repel fast-moving objects with ease! Once the great Ebonsteel Forge in Urviksten ran hot, but was extinguished by the betrayal of the last great Ebonfrost, Urvic, upon his return. In Blodfjell, the old Ebonsteel forges remain, yet have not seen a smith who can operate them in centuries.\n\nUntil now. The Skalds have pondered over the origins of the Ebonsteel artifacts and their magical properties, and have come to a conclusion: they were crafted with the conjunction of the master smith and skald working together. The Skalds have prepared a list of songs and litanies to work the metal, however it is not only their input that is needed. Scholars have studied the treacherous mountains and steep valleys of Gerudia, looking for where Ebonsteel may be found. Should we but provide them the funds to the skalds and scholars, we may find a practical revival to the art of Ebonforging!"
