 reform_roilsard_decision_title:0 "Unite the Roilsardi People"
 reform_roilsard_decision_desc:0 "The Roilsardi people have long been a thorn (hence why thorns are common in their heraldry) on the sides of both Lorent and Anbennar. It is rare that the people are ever united due to their tumultuous nature, but a worthy nation capable of doing so will no doubt be worthy of the title of Duke of Roilsard."
 flavor_saloren.1.t:0 "Seeking Protection"
 flavor_saloren.1.d:0 "In the chaos of the Lilac Wars, the duchy of Roilsard was destroyed. We are its last true remnant. In such trying times, to attempt to survive alone is to ensure one's downfall. We must find protection, in the form of a liege or an ally."
 flavor_saloren.1.a:0 "Offer Lorent fealty for Roilsard."
 flavor_saloren.1.b:0 "Offer Wineport friendship for Toarnaire."
 flavor_saloren.1.c:0 "Offer Rubenaire friendship for Vivinmar."
 flavor_saloren.1.e:0 "This is unnecessary, we shall go it alone."
 flavor_saloren.2.t:0 "Offer from Saloren"
 flavor_saloren.2.d:0 "Saloren has offered to swear fealty to us in exchange for our province of Roilsard and a guarantee of autonomy. If we accept, they will be one step closer to uniting the Roilsardi peoples."
 flavor_saloren.2.a:0 "Accept!"
 flavor_saloren.2.b:0 "Refuse!"
 flavor_saloren.3.t:0 "Offer from Saloren"
 flavor_saloren.3.d:0 "Saloren seeks to unite the Roilsardi peoples, and has offered their friendship in exchange for our province of Toarnaire."

 flavor_saloren.4.t:0 "Offer from Saloren"

 flavor_saloren.6.t:0 "Roilsardi Vampires"
 flavor_saloren.6.d:0 "Reports of vampires, fleeing from Roilsard, have reached your inner council.\n\nIf we are to act swiftly, we can make them reconsider calling [Root.Country.GetName] home, though perhaps they can be of use to us..."
 flavor_saloren.6.a:0 "We are not Roilsard, they are not welcome here."
 flavor_saloren.6.b:0 "We will support their efforts."

 saloren_securing_county_title:0 "Securing The County" 
 saloren_securing_county_desc:0 "The County of Saloren is a proud land. For all the moves required on the road ahead of us, we must first be secure in the ancestral seat of the homes of the síl Saloren and síl na Loop respectively. The ranks of our Swordmasters must be replenished, and the stones of the ancient castle must be bolstered. Our seat must be ready once more, for with such a storm to come, the end of the Lilac Wars may only be a brief reprieve for our people." 
 saloren_in_their_faces_title:0 "In Their Faces" 
 saloren_in_their_faces_desc:0 "Saloren’s defiance, even in submission, has been a slap in the face for the Siloriel court at Lorentainé and the Lorentish garrison in the County of Roilsard. Yet this defiance wins us friends across Lencenor: other fair-weather vassals look to our count for leadership as we exchange letters and tidings of our shared misery in this suborned state. With support from our síl na Loop allies, we must not fail."
 saloren_prepare_for_inevitable_title:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable" 
 saloren_prepare_for_inevitable_desc:0 "Across our dominion, there is a sense that the final clash is soon to occur; what was put wrong by the Lilac Wars will finally begin to be put to right. Our defiance is popular and grassroots, filling rowdy taverns and inspiring new folk songs among those who chafe against the current King in Lorent. A clash approaches, and destiny awaits."
 saloren_resurgent_spirit_title:0 "Resurgent Spirit" 
 saloren_resurgent_spirit_desc:0 "Roilsard, the beautiful heart of the duchy itself, has been brought back into the hands of its true fellows, those to whom it earnestly belongs. Already adventurers who had given up hope of it ever being freed from foreign rule have begun to return in droves. They bring tidings of an old god redeemed, and soon our home too shall be so peopled."
 saloren_last_roilsardi_title:0 "Last of the True Roilsardi" 
 saloren_last_roilsardi_desc:0 " What was broken can be reforged. This is our dream for the dissolved Duchy of Roilsard, and while we had hoped to do it entirely by ourselves, this seems not to be on the cards. As the count’s plans require protection in the short term, we must look to a patron to weather the storm, at least for the moment. Kylian or his rivals would suffice, and they need not know of our full ambition. We need only time to turn the tables."
 saloren_city_of_thorns_title:0 "A City of Thorns" 
 saloren_city_of_thorns_desc:0 "Toarnaire was one of our greater losses during the partition, taken by the opportunistic League of Winebay during the Lilac Wars. The Fat scraped before the Taster and was granted succor by the poisoned cup that runneth over. Lucian has fled, but the remaining burghers come to profess their allegiance and bring promises with them. We bite back our distaste at these fair-weather friends, even as we look to take them as loyal subjects once more."
 saloren_duchy_reforged_title:0 "The Duchy Reforged" 
 saloren_duchy_reforged_desc:0 "Roilsard, partitioned in the Lilac Wars, has been brought back under the banner of the County of Saloren. The union of the síl Saloren and síl na Loop has seen greater dividends than the mere independence they had both sought to uphold, and even now preparations are beginning for the ducal investiture to begin."
 saloren_southern_tip_title:0 "The Southern Tip" 
 saloren_southern_tip_desc:0 "Vivinmar is the southernmost point of the old duchy, and many old families who left for the Borders can draw their history back here. That legacy of martial nobility lives on among the less prestigious ranks of barons and knights. These old marcher lords come to hear Caylen’s call, and memories of Tretun and the síl Rubenaire melt with the spring snow."
 saloren_prepare_inevitable_tt:0 "§MWe will be able to gain a reduced shock damage taken modifier if we have a spy network of 40 in Rubyhold or 125 opinion with Silverforge in addition to the base requirements.\n\nWe will also be able to remove the fog of war with Lorent if we have a spy network of 50 there!§!"
 saloren_resurgent_spirit_tt:0 "§MWe will have an easier time of this if our adventurers are more loyal than strictly necessary.§!"
