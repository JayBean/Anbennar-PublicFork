 urviksten_naugsvol_avnkaup_title:0 "Conquer Olavlund"
 urviksten_naugsvol_avnkaup_desc:0 "The Gerudians of the Giant's Grave Sea are named after the ancient hero Olav. Said to have been the son of Urvik, Olav brought the Gerudian peoples further into their new homeland to where Redgarhavn and Skaldol now stand. Ever since his ancient hall of Olavsborg fell into insignificance,  Olavlund has always been fractured among small Jarldoms precariously perched between sea and mountains. Urviksten has prided itself on being the largest, although the truth is that the land is nothing but rock and crag. The Ebonfrosts of Urviksten cannot last forever as lords of empty mountains: We must finish off our vexatious rival of Naugsvol, then onwards to subdue Avnkaup, Redgarhavn, and Skaldol. With the spiritual heart and the secular brain of Olavslund dominated, Urviksten shall once more assert itself as the true ruler of all Olavish."
 urviksten_fortify_against_graytide_title:0 "Fortify Against the Graytide"
 urviksten_fortify_against_graytide_desc:0 "Though our warriors might be the best in all of Gerudia, we must concede that the monstrous Gray beasts that have emerged from the Northern Pass are impressive. These Gray-Skined ‘Orcs’ have subjugated our old enemies of Vrorenmarck in one fell swoop and fought our armies to a standstill once before. But we are not Reachmen, we are Gerudians! We adapt where they remain rigid. The Reachmen failed to defend their many castles: we will remain vigilant for the inevitable attack, and we will be ready with fortifications that will give them dread!"
 urviksten_assemble_the_men_title:0 "Assemble the Men!"
 urviksten_assemble_the_men_desc:0 "'Hear me, men of Urviksten! You are descendants of many heroes, from the First Urvik, to Olav, to Castan Ebonfrost. We have fought to protect our homes from the hated Trolls, the traitorous Reachmen, and we have fought to take what is ours from them. The Vrorenmark has been dyed Gray with Orcs, foul monsters whose green kin have slain Castanor. But we Gerudians slay monsters! They are naught but stranger men who bleed and die, that fight with might not from skill but from their ill-tempered savagery. Warriors of Urviksten, follow me, heir of Castan Ebonfrost, for together we will drive these beasts from our lands and we will unite our brethren!'"
 urviksten_descendants_of_castan_ebonfrost_title:0 "Lineage of Ebonfrost"
 urviksten_descendants_of_castan_ebonfrost_desc:0 "The Ebonfrost dynasty is known infamously throughout all of Cannor as great conquerors and warriors. In 865 AA Gunnar Ebonfrost, once a lowly Reaver, rose to greatness when he conquered all of Castanor in one year, riseing to be the 49th Castan. He secured his rule by passing their Trials after smashing his way past their armies, and forever changed the Trials to be available only for his hereditary heir. His dynasty ruled Castanor until 1015 AA, when Castan LIII's enthrallment was broken which led to his death by Nichmer the Sorceror King. Fortunately he was succeeded by two sons and a daughter: Garrec unsuccessfully attempting to reclaim Castanor, the Urvic went north and reclaimed his namesake, Castan Ebonfrost's ancestral home of Urviksten, and Alvara married Urion Starsworn of Silurion fame. We are the descendants of these great men and women. I will not let the Ebonfrost name down."
 urviksten_blood_of_victors_title:0 "Blood of Victors"
 urviksten_blood_of_victors_desc:0 "The strength of the Ebonfrosts’ is no coincidence, it is a direct heritage of our dynasty. From Castan Ebonfrost to Urvik to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Ebonfrosts have all been physically powerful, as well as being pale as snow and hair dark as a raven. The Gerudians respect strength: let us ensure that they do not see a lack of that in us."
 urviksten_olavlund_title:0 "Skaldhyrric Knowledge"
 urviksten_olavlund_desc:0 "Now that the Skalds have been brought under the wings of the Black Dragon, we can finally begin the process of tapping into their library. In particular, we have reason to believe that that they may have ancient texts that detail the process of forging and manufacturing Ebonsteel ore; a process lost to us since the betrayal of Bryntolf. Though sifting through the years of poorly filed, forgotten and obtuse scripts will be arduous, if such knowledge can be re-acquired here, it will be a incredible boom to our military might."
 urviksten_claim_the_giants_tears_title:0 "Claim the Giant's Tears"
 urviksten_claim_the_giants_tears_desc:0 "It is not enough to wait for the Orcs to attack us, for they will not perish on their own. Past the southern borders of Urviksten the mirelands of Jotunstar are infested with gray beasts, the very same land that Urvik Ebonfrost crossed to reclaim his homeland after the fall of Castanor. Where this land was once the bridge for the return of the Ebonfrosts to Urviksten, it will serve again as a bridge for our return to Vrorenmarck and all of Castanor!"
 urviksten_castletown_title:0 "Urviksten Castletown"
 urviksten_castletown_desc:0 "Following the construction of the new fortifications in Urviksten, the prosperity of the town rekindled. Safe within the walls and embankments, trade prospered and families grew, bringing relevance to Urviksten not seen since the legendary days of the first Urvik. Where once this was known as the cave where Urvik and the first Gerudians fought the Trolls valiantly, Urviksten is now a walled city and a vision of the future for Olavlund."
 urviksten_settle_esfjall_title:0 "Settle Esvjall"
 urviksten_settle_esfjall_desc:0 "Esvjall was the borderland of Urviksten, scarcely more populated than the mirelands of the Jotunstar. Following the conquest of the Jotunstar and the prosperity of Urviksten town, Esfjall was no longer beset by the many perils of a borderland. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Urviksten funded the settlement of these lands to establish control over the new Jotunstar marches."
 urviksten_ebonfrosts_landing_title:0 "Path of Castan Ebonfrost"
 urviksten_ebonfrosts_landing_desc:0 "Vrorenmarck was the first land ruled by Castan Ebonfrost: it will be our first step to reclaiming his legacy. In his day the land was a puppet of Castanor that foolishly thought they play puppet master with the first Ebonfrost. Now Vrorenmarck is a shadow of its past, squatted on by Gray Orcs while the Reachmen live as their servants. We must take Ebonfrosts first holding back from the Orcs, for then the route to Escann will be open to us."
 urviksten_gifrbygd_title:0 "Hunt the Troll Lands"
 urviksten_gifrbygd_desc:0 "Beyond the eastern Titan's Rest Mountains is a vast wilderness still haunted by Trolls. Far Gerudia has served as a hunting ground for Gerudians looking for fame but has always been too dangerous for habitation. Even without the threat of the Trolls, harsh winters and meagre food make this a land of starvation far worse than even the backwaters in Olavlund. Untold riches await us in the north, hoarded by the Trolls. Let us seize them for ourselves!"
 urviksten_alenic_title:0 "Alenic Gerudians"
 urviksten_alenic_desc:0 "The Alenic Reach was settled by Gerudians since time immemorial, but after the end of Elkaesal the White's tyranny in the Era of Frost those who remained in the Reach have become more like the Alenics and the Escanni. The majority of the Reachmen follow the Regent Court, although there are some who follow the Skaldhyrric Faith as a result of regimes lead by Reavers and by Castan Ebonfrosts invasion. This Skaldhyrric minority is ours to protect: we must ensure that they do not face the threat of Gray Orcs or other invaders again!"
 urviksten_alenic_tt:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on §YWhite Reachmen§! provinces in §YAlenic Reach§! Region."
 urviksten_bay_of_chills_title:0 "Thaw the Trade"
 urviksten_bay_of_chills_desc:0 "The Bay of Chills was once flush with trade from the Reachmen and prowled by Reavers, but since the conquest of Vrorenmark by the Gray Orcs most of the eastern trade has frozen like winter ice. Now that we have ended the Orcish invasion the Reachmen have no reason to fear the seas: now our Reavers will protect the traders for a small protection fee."
 urviksten_balmire_title:0 "Rebuild Balmire"
 urviksten_balmire_desc:0 "One of Castanor's mighty fortresses built by Balgar the Builder, Bal Mire has marked the western border of Castanor. During the Greentide it was occupied by foul green Orcs, but the worst fear is for the fort to be occupied by the Gawedi. If Urviksten is to reclaim Castanor we must ensure that its western border is free from the Alenic eagle."
 urviksten_alen_trade_title:0 "Secure the Alen River"
 urviksten_alen_trade_desc:0 "The mighty Alen River has its roots in northern Escann, connecting the markets of Castonborg and the Silvermere towns with the Gawedi. This trade has brought prosperity to both lands in the past, but Gawed threatens our trade rights over the Upper Alen. The Gawedi see themselves as children and heirs of the Alen river, claiming that the whole of the river should be theirs. Let us make an example of those who would threaten our rights as lords of Castonborg."
 urviksten_repair_western_forts_title:0 "West Castanorian Fortifications"
 urviksten_repair_western_forts_desc:0 "Bal Mire is the mightiest of Castanor's western border forts, but it is not the only one. The western border does not only hold the Gawedi back: there are also the pompous Arbarani half-elves, the isolated and ruthless Ibevari elves, and those Aldresian spellblades. Worse, the Orcs and the adventurer squatters have claimed these lands: we must assert and fortify our rightful claim with brick and mortar."
 urviksten_gerudian_trials_title:0 "Gerudian Trials"
 urviksten_gerudian_trials_desc:0 "The Trials of Castan were altered forever when Castan Ebonfrost changed them to be only available to his designated heir, but they were rigged for the heir to succeed. Let us reconstitute this policy of solidifying the stability of our nation, starting with a renovation of the old North Citadel as a cover for this operation."
 urviksten_nyr_ebonmark_title:0 "Nyr Ebonmark"
 urviksten_nyr_ebonmark_desc:0 "Following the ascension of Castan Ebonfrost to the throne of Castanor, Ebonmark was resettled by Gerudians. This duchy was known for its loyal and mighty warriors, most famous of all the aptly named Ebon Guard. The loyalty of the province held true after the fall of Castanor in the War of the Sorcerer King. Garrek Ebonfrost ruled Ebonmark in these tumultuous times, striving to reclaim the kingdom, but was defeated by the Kingdom of Vrorenmark. Now Ebonmark is empty, its towns and temples both Skaldhyrric and Regent Court but rubble after the Greentide. Ebonmark will be rebuilt as a shining example of our return to Castanor!"
 urviksten_breach_westgate_title:0 "Breach Westgate"
 urviksten_breach_westgate_desc:0 "The White Walls of Castanor guard the ancient city of Castonborg from the Serpentspine to the Silvermere. Westgate was the primary gate on the western segment of the walls, the site of many battles over many centuries of those attempting to enter Inner Castanor, and the site of the tomb of our founder. Following the Greentide it may not be necessary to control Westgate to enter, but it would give us security and legitimacy."
 urviksten_trialmount_title:0 "Surmount the Trialmount"
 urviksten_trialmount_desc:0 "The symbol of Castanor second only to Castonborg itself, the Trialmount is where every claimant has undergone the Trials of Castan. If we are to prove ourselves as the heirs of Castan we must reclaim the mountain, and the Kastali Ebonfrost!"
 #urviksten_Kastonath_title:0 "Heart of Castanor"
 #urviksten_Kastonath_desc:0 "What was once the beating heart of Halann's greatest empire is now a smouldering ruin of overgrown pavement. What has been lost may be rebuilt, for much of the city can be repaired and the rest salvaged for building materials. Once more will the Ebonfrosts rule this great city, all those who stand in our way will kneel or be cast done!"
 urviksten_castanor_title:0 "Resurgence of Castanor"
 urviksten_castanor_desc:0 "The reclamation of Castonborg has seen a miracle of reconstruction under the Ebonfrosts, with empty ruined streets cleared and ancient halls converted into Skaldhyrric temples and mead halls. The Ebonfrosts have made this all possible, but we will not be seen as Kastons’ if we just rule the city. Those who tried to reclaim the empire in the past, and had only controlled Castonborg, fell apart due to civil war or other disasters. Not only must Castonborg be rebuilt, but the lands that feed it."
 urviksten_white_walls_tt:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on the §YWhite Walls of Castanor§!."
 urviksten_onyx_fleet_title:0 "Onyx Fleet"
 urviksten_onyx_fleet_desc:0 "The Reaver fleets of old were designed as raiding ships for crossing wild seas and upriver, not designed for open war. With prime timber from the Black Pines, we must build new ships, ones that can carry the immense weight of cannons while being resistant to enemy fire. The Ebonfrost fleets will rule the waves in likes never seen since the Era of Black Frost!"
 urviksten_far_gerudian_rangers_title:0 "Far Gerudian Rangers"
 urviksten_far_gerudian_rangers_desc:0 "Far Gerudia was not as replete with Troll riches as we once thought. The Golden Forest may exist, but it is as the tales say, a cautionary tale for those seeking great wealth. But there are some spoils of the taiga: furry and woolly creatures yield valuable pelts, and prime timber and sap can be found for boat construction. The problem is that this wilderness is ever plagued by Trolls and bandits who prey on our countrymen. We must establish a taskforce to patrol Far Gerudia against these threats."
 urviksten_black_pines_title:0 "Black Pines"
 urviksten_black_pines_desc:0 "The mountain vales of Urviksten hold iron-hard Black Pines. Long seen as a detriment due to the hardship of cutting them, with modern techniques they can be felled. Unaltered they make perfect posts or beams, far outperforming other timber, and as planks they can now be shaped as flexibly while retaining much more strength."
 urviksten_restart_ebonsteel_forge_title:0 "Restart the Ebonsteel Forge"
 urviksten_restart_ebonsteel_forge_desc:0 "An ancient artifact of unknown origin, the Ebonsteel Forge has produced the finest weapons and armour of Urviksten and possibly all of Gerudia. Fuelled by Black Pines, the forge radiates with heat far stronger than other forges, infused with skaldic magics, this great device allows the alloys found in rock formations of Urviksten to go from mere trinkets to the finest weapons and armour in the world. Though "repaired" since the traitor Bryntolf destroyed it after Urvik Ebonfrost reclaimed his home, it was repaired poorly, and these days it is merely used as a mundane forge. With our reforged links with the skalds, and the rediscovery of the ebonforging, the forge will be fully restored, and with our armies once more clad in Ebonsteel of old Cannor will once again learn to fear the north."
 urviksten_northern_pass_title:0 "Origin of the Graytide"
 urviksten_northern_pass_desc:0 "Beyond the Jotunstar and north of the Serpentspine, the Gray Orcs gathered to invade Vrorenmark and Gerudia. Never again will we be threatened by monstrous invasion! We have stopped their invasion, but there is no guarantee the threat is over. The Northern Pass where they muster be seized and pacified, we cannot wait for the dwarves to end this threat! The fate of Escann will never happen again, not in Escann or Gerudia or anywhere!"
 urviksten_thaw_the_trade_title:0 "Freeze the Trade"
 urviksten_thaw_the_trade_desc:0 "The Eagle of the North watches our steps, ever circling, waiting for a small slip to attack, while the cities of the Western Alenic Reach suck at our trade like the fattened leeches they are. The time has come to strike the first blow; even if we don't have the military strength to smash them, we can undermine them in other ways. We shall freeze the trade routes between us and the Alenic nations. They shall profit from the hard work of our hands no longer."
 urviksten_restore_the_cities_title:0 "Restore the Cities"
 urviksten_restore_the_cities_desc:0 "The White Reachmen have always seen us as fearsome Reavers, willing to burn an entire city to ashes in search of the slightest wealth. But now, we have to change their opinion of us if we want to rule over them effectively. Let us rebuild those cities destroyed by the savage Graytide. Let these cities rise again, shining as examples that we, the sons of Castan, are righteous conquerors, and that those who accept our just and wise overlordship will be assured of great prosperity."
 urviksten_the_great_migration_title:0 "The Great Migration"
 urviksten_the_great_migration_desc:0 "In ancient times, when Castanor was ours, the Ebonmark was the heart of our power. It was a land filled with brave Gerudian warriors, absolutely loyal to the house of Ebonfrost. Of late it is nothing more than an abandoned and ruined land. The Greentide, and ages of neglect by the "successor" kingdoms have left the Ebonmark as one of the poorest lands in Escann. However, that is about to change. With great effort, the dilapidated infrastructure of the Ebonmark will be rebuilt, restored and reforged anew, and a flood of Gerudian migrants will be called to settle the area and repopulate it. The Ebonmark will be once more a tool in our grip, and with that tool we shall restore our empire."
 urviksten_crossing_the_bay_title:0 "Crossing the Bay"
 urviksten_crossing_the_bay_desc:0 "For centuries, the cities of the Reach feared us. We were reviled as reavers; we burned entire villages in search of the most pitiful trinkets, only to slink back north. Occasionally Gerudian warlords managed to carve out short-lived realms in the reach, but few survived the death of their founders. No more. Gerudia stands united, and the cities of the Reach will not be merely plundered. Before, we were feared as reavers, but now, under House Ebonfrost, the time has come for them to fear us as conquerors."
 urviksten_the_reach_title:0 "Governing the Reach"
 urviksten_the_reach_desc:0 "With the conquest of the Alenic Reach, a surprising number of problems have arisen, from mewling merchants in Bayvic to the fate of the last-surviving Adshaws. We are also concerned with the fate of one of the largest cities in the Reach, the elven city of Celmaldor. We have instructed that our advisors compile the specifics of these problems, and to bring them before the monarch post haste."
 urviksten_song_of_the_forefathers_title:0 "Songs for the Forefathers"
 urviksten_song_of_the_forefathers_desc:0 "In ages past, the Reachmen were not unlike us. Though the skaldhyrric tales were never venerated en-masse here as back in Old Gerudia, they sang tales like us, lived like us. That changed long ago, but with our consolidation of the Reach, the time has come to remind them of their past. By order of the Ebonfrost House and by request of Skaldskola, a great host of Skalds will be sent to all the places of the Reach, with the objective of reminding our cousins of their true origins, and ensuring that the Dragon remains in slumber for evermore."
 urviksten_unified_vrorenmarch_title:0 "A March, Renewed..." 
 urviksten_unified_vrorenmarch_desc:0 "Through blood and fire we have triumphed; everything the world wanted to throw at us has been defeated and destroyed. The ancient Vrorenmarck could not finish us off, the Graytide could only slow our rise and in the end, the gray orcs failed before our cunning and resilience. But this is not the end - it is just the beginning! With the conquest of the eastern Reach, we have renewed the march. Our own march south must now also be renewed. From the mighty steps of the Citadel of Frost, our armies will roll south like the unstoppable Glaciers of Gerudia. Our Throne awaits!"
 urviksten_the_north_reclaimed_title:0 "Mired in the Past"
 urviksten_the_north_reclaimed_desc:0 "Though we have restored Ebonmark, the time has not yet come to advance into the heart of Castanor; we must secure our flanks. The Gawedi vulture to our west awaits but a single mistake to descend on us and destroy our dream before its realization. To forestall this, we must retake and rebuild the decrepit fortress of Bal Mire - the place where Castanor died, and where the last Castan fell under the knife of vile Nichmer. Once secure, the path to the heart of Escann, the great city of Castonborg and, more importantly, the Kastali Ebonfrost will finally be open to us."
 urviksten_the_lonely_mountain_title:0 "The Lonely Mountain"
 urviksten_the_lonely_mountain_desc:0 "Our explorers have discovered a huge mountain separate from the Serpentspine mountains, but just as dangerous and rich, with a large and almost endless supply of metals. They call for colonizing expeditions to be sent out, in order to create new mining communities to further fuel our war effort."
 urviksten_tvillingarna_title:0 "Tvillingarna"
 urviksten_tvillingarna_desc:0 "Thanks to our efforts, the Northern Pass is almost ours. With this stabilization, the population begins to condense in certain places. Two of these settlements stand out above the rest, popularly called Tvilingarna (The Twins). The first of these is Vatnmaln, settled on the shore of Lake Sashkras, created for the purpose of refining all the steel brought from the Lonely Mountain. The second is Vidrgardr, born as a humble ranging post, now the centre of lumber refining for the eastern Northern Pass, and through which all the lumber from the region is shipped to Vrorenborg via the Logr. It is only reasonable that we should continue investing in and further empowering these two cities, as centres of civilization in the monstrous northeast."  
 urviksten_veins_of_steel_title:0 "Veins of Steel"
 urviksten_veins_of_steel_desc:0 "Our efforts to establish mining operations within and around the Lonely Mountain have been rewarded; the mining prospectors we sent have found vast veins of high-quality iron within the Lonely Mountain. This is a golden opportunity, as previously our production of Ebonsteel was severely limited due to our comparative lack of good quality iron. We must set up new and larger mining facilities to take advantage of all that ore. All in the name of the reconquest, and the glory of the House Ebonfrost."  
 urviksten_found_bpc_title:0 "The Black Pine Company"   
 urviksten_found_bpc_desc:0 "With the establishment of intensive logging in Baldersby and Silvrborg, our production of quality timber has increased dramatically; with it, our steel and weapon production has also increased. To better explore and exploit this new found wealth, we should follow the example of our cousins in Regarhaven. We shall create a monopoly company to administer all commercial logging within our realm, with all profits to go to the house of Ebonfrost. With this new instrument of commerce and productivity we shall be able to fuel the reconquest of Escann and its subsequent reconstruction."
 urviksten_dalr_mines_title:0 "Dalrfjall Mines" 
 urviksten_dalr_mines_desc:0 "The resources of Dalrfjall, long left unexploited by the Bjarnriki, are now within our grasp. Previous mining surveys have found great mineral wealth in the hills, but the harsh landscape and the scattered, disgusting fjord trolls have made it difficult to exploit these minerals. The riches of Dalrfjall are too great to ignore. New mining communities will be created to exploit the Dalrfjall, for our forges are ever-hungry." 
 urviksten_fjarforska_title:0 "Establish the Fjarforska"
 urviksten_fjarforska_desc:0 "The success of the Far Gerudian Rangers has been impressive, but the independent nature of the Rangers is a concern within the court. Royal advisors say the Rangers' efficiency has declined over time, but those in charge of the Black Pine Company have a solution. Put the remaining Far Gerudian Rangers under the direct command of the crown company. With these rangers organized as a new military formation, their first task will be the expansion of the Black Pine Company all across the Northern Pass. The vast forests of the far northeast will be ours to use, and the Fjarforska will guarantee our control."
 merc_fjarforska:0 "Fjarforska"
 urviksten_eastern_anvils_title:0 "The Eastern Anvils"
 urviksten_eastern_anvils_desc:0 "The brave Rangers who venture beyond the Northern Pass speak of a beautiful land of even greater wealth beyond the Vidrgardr, but its dangers are many. Those Rangers who have returned from the place speak of Ogres, much more organized than those found in the Northern Pass, and of strange violent-tempered quadrupedal creatures that are a combination of horse and man. Though we must eventually move east to claim these lands for our own, we must secure the pass first. We shall build a chain of fortifications, an anvil, against which these monstrous denizens will beat themselves uselessly. Behind our eastern anvil we will gather our strength, for the time will come when we make these creatures fear our steel."
 urviksten_vrorenburg_arsenal_title:0 "Vrorenborg Arsenal"
 urviksten_vrorenburg_arsenal_desc:0 "With the ancient fortress of Vrorenborg back in our hands, we once again have a harbour worthy of our mighty fleet. Or we would, had not the orcs and the reachmen before them left the old facilities derelict and poorly maintained. This will not stand. By royal decree, the city of Vrorenborg will become the arsenal of the Onyx fleet, restored to its former might, from which our power will project throughout the Giant's Grave."
 urviksten_the_bears_den_title:0 "The Bears Den"
 urviksten_the_bears_den_desc:0 "With the cities of Konungrhavn and Reverhavn in our hands, our dreadful vengeance against the sons of Bera is nearly complete. We should press our advantage. We will settle our accounts with the Northern Bear, the humiliation of Castan Ebonfrost in Vertesk will be avenged, and in Gerudia, only the Black Dragon will reign."  
 urviksten_dalr_bpc_title:0 "North Dalr Lodges"
 urviksten_dalr_bpc_desc:0 "With our control over the Dalr secured, we can begin to harness the ancient forests of the region for our purposes. The BPC has already sent surveyors to the area, so it is only natural that a new branch of the Black Pine Company be created. The great forests of the Dalr will feed the reforging of Castanor. All in the name of the glorious house of Ebonfrost"
 urviksten_restore_trialmount_title:0 "The Kastali Ebonfrost"
 urviksten_restore_trialmount_desc:0 "After centuries, there is an Ebonfrost once again enthroned in the North Citadel, or in our parlance, Kastali Ebonfrost. But years of misrule by the "adventurous" Escanni, compounded by the previous Greentide has turned the once glorious Citadel into a ruin. We must resolve this. By order of the Ebonfrost, all necessary funds and efforts will be devoted to restore Kastali Ebonfrost to the glory that belongs to it, as our permanent seat deserves no less."
 urviksten_no_safe_havns_title:0 "No Safe Havens"
 urviksten_no_safe_havns_desc:0 "The mighty thief-kings of Bjarnrik, the sons of Bera. Bera, who in ages past humiliated Castan Ebonfrost by sacking his city of Vertesk during her great raid. This is a humiliation we have not forgotten and will soon avenge. With the Vrorenborg arsenal brought up to modern standard, and the might of the Onyx fleet at our command, we shall secure the coast of their kingdom. The great fleet of the sons of Bera may be large and fearsome, but without safe harbour, it will be as useless as a toothless hound."
 #urviksten_castanor_title:0 "Rebuilding the Capital"
 #urviksten_castanor_desc:0 "Our years of absence has been felt everywhere within Castanor, but nowhere more clearly than Castonborg itself. Occupied first by indolent traitors and then a savage marauding horde, the great city has fallen into squalor and disrepair. It must be rebuilt and restored to its former grandeur. Only then will we start being seen as the true rulers of this land once more."

 # Events
 flavor_urviksten.01.t:0 "The fate of the Celmaldor Elves?"
 flavor_urviksten.01.desc:0 "Arriving during the War of the Sorcerer-King, the Celmaldor elves were not directly involved in the war against Castanor. They instead directed themselves against a much-reduced Adderic kingdom, and at times they have been both friend and foe to the Gerudians. A Gerudian even led the elves of Celmaldor for a time. But they are still elves, and this creates certain... divisions within the royal court, with some advocating for the expulsion of the elves, or their outright annihilation, and others saying we should let them live, as they had no role in our unjust eviction from Castanor."
 flavor_urviksten.01.a:0 "Allow these elves to remain. We have no quarrel with them."
 flavor_urviksten.01.b:0 "Elves cannot be trusted, force them to leave the harbor."
 flavor_urviksten.01.c:0 "Burn the filthy knife ears in there homes!"

 
 flavor_urviksten.02.t:0 "The fate of the Bayvic Merchants?"
 flavor_urviksten.02.desc:0 "The Bayvic merchants have always been a greedy and stubborn bunch, and they are showing their nature now more than ever. While refusing to be accountable to us now would be suicidal, they demand we sit down at the negotiating table with them. The royal advisors are divided on how to deal with this; some advocate negotiating with the merchants, and showing them that whilst we are open to cooperation, it us who will be dictating the terms. \n Many say that burning Bayvic to the ground would be the sensible thing to do, as a response to their insolence and ridiculous delusion of parity. There is also a select group who know of a secret offer made to his majesty by the surviving goblins of the Reach, survivors of the green and grey tides, who beg for a home and pledge their allegiance to whoever can give them one."
 flavor_urviksten.02.a:0 "We will do what we have always done, loot the city as punishment for there delusions!"
 flavor_urviksten.02.b:0 "These leeches yet have useful skills, lets make deal... on our terms."
 flavor_urviksten.02.c:0 "Allow them to take control of the city, taking the gold of the displaced merchants as payment. Who knew goblins could be so reasonable? "
 
 
 flavor_urviksten.03.t:0 "The Fate of Last Adshaws?"
 flavor_urviksten.03.desc:0 "The first problem brought before us concerns the fate of House Adshaw. Once former lords of the Adderic Kingdom, they have fallen on hard times, as we have done in times past. We have been approached by the last Adshaw - or so he claims - offering to serve us in return for us restoring his rule in the Adderwood and Rycastle. \nOthers say that we should instead confiscate his land for the use by Black Pine Company. \n Finally, some see only the rebellious spirit of Crovis in the remaining Adshaw, and counsel that only the annihilation of the house of Adshaw can assure that they cease to be a threat to our rule."
 flavor_urviksten.03.a:0 "Legitimize the young noble to rule as our vassal!"
 flavor_urviksten.03.b:0 "How can we risk the duplicitous Adshaws to live?"
 flavor_urviksten.03.c:0 "Purchase most of his land for use by the BPC."

 
 flavor_urviksten.04.t:0 "The Crumbling Gauntlet?"
 flavor_urviksten.04.desc:0 "In the city of Westgate lies the tomb of our first Castan, the first Ebonfrost, who conquered this land long ago. That we have been able to secure this place alone is testament to our resilience and determination in the face of adversity. But here amongst the tombs of our ancestors lies one of the greatest lost relics of the Era of Black Ice: The Ebonfist itself, the gauntlet and weapon of our founder, entombed here as his empire fell around our ears. Though time has not been kind to it, its recovery represents to many the first true sign of victory in our reconquest, and a physical reminder of why we fight."
 flavor_urviksten.04.a:0 "One day, we will have the technology."

  
 flavor_urviksten.05.t:0 "The Exiled Return?"
 flavor_urviksten.05.desc:0 "With our total occupation of the old land of Vrorenmark, many once rural White Reachmen who were expelled by the Graytide to the coastal cities are clamoring to return home. Whilst they know the land and their return would doubtless drastically benefit our nation, many doubt the loyalty that exiles have to us. On the other hand, the veterans of the war of reconquest claim that they have a right to settle and live in the land conquered by their hands and abandoned by these Reachmen in the face of the orcs. Will the exiles be allowed to return?"
 flavor_urviksten.05.a:0 "Our warriors shall repopulate the Vrorenmark. They have earned the right of stewardship."
 flavor_urviksten.05.b:0 "The land was Reachman land, and it pleases us to allow it to be so again." 

 
 flavor_urviksten.07.t:0 "The Fate of the Fjord Trolls."
 flavor_urviksten.07.desc:0 "Though we know Bera as a Reaver and a slayer, the people of the Dalr Valley know her as a slayer of trolls. When she returned she led the Dalr people against the trolls of the valley, driving them to the brink of extinction. But in their weakness, the Bjarnssons allowed these monstrous brutes to multiply and recover, their descendants becoming what we now call the Fjord Trolls. We shall correct this. By our hand the last trolls of Gerudia will be drowned in the fjords, and their old lands will be populated by Olavish settlers."
 flavor_urviksten.07.a:0 "Exterminate the trolls, and settle the fjords with Olavish loyalists."

 flavor_urviksten.08.t:0 "BPC send surveyors to North Dalr."
 flavor_urviksten.08.desc:0 "The north of Dalr has always been dark, forested land, and long have the Bjarnriki utilized these trees for the purposes of shipbuilding and construction. Many of their operations have ceased production, however, and many were never very efficient anyway. These operations naturally now come under the auspices of the BPC, and surveyors and veteran foremen will be dispatched to the area to bring the local logging industry up to our standards."
 flavor_urviksten.08.a:0 "More wood for the fires."

 
 flavor_urviksten.09.t:0 "An Aspiring Explorer."
 flavor_urviksten.09.desc:0 "Not all the children of the Ebonfrosts are leaders and warriors. We are also natural sailors. Leif Ebonfrost, scion of an unimportant branch of our family, is known throughout Olavlund as an adventurous and pious captain. Leif was always a romantic soul, long fascinated with the Tales of the Northern Raider and Boat Builders of North Gerudia. Luckily his wanderlust has become an asset in the Age of Exploration. He has gathered a group of sailors and warriors, and now with his new base in Revrhavn sets sail into the Northern thaw for lands uncharted."
 flavor_urviksten.09.a:0 "Let him sail in search of new found lands!"
 
 flavor_urviksten.10.t:0 "The Den of Bera."
 flavor_urviksten.10.desc:0 "Finally the bear lies supine before us. Ages ago Bera built this kingdom on the back of her spoils from her great raid, upon our humiliation. Now we shall reclaim what was stolen long ago. The only question remains: shall we be merciful, or ruthless?"
 flavor_urviksten.10.a:0 "Let this saga end with ruthlessness."
 flavor_urviksten.10.b:0 "Let this saga end with mercy."
 
 flavor_urviksten.11.t:0 "The Ebonfrost Dynasty."
 flavor_urviksten.11.desc:0 "The powerful Ebonfrost's. Since the first of their line fought his way up from lowly reaver to become 49th emperor of Castanor, the family name has been synonymous with Power and resourcefulness in Gerudia. The dynasty was presumed to have died out but it now seems that there still exists a member, although their claim to the throne is considered weak. Since [Root.Monarch.GetName] currently lacks an heir, should we perhaps acknowledge this Ebonfrost as a legitimate heir?"
 flavor_urviksten.11.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] shall continue to rule!"
 flavor_urviksten.11.b:0 "The House of Ebonfrost must return!"
