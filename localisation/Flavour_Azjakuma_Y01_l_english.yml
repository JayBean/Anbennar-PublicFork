 Y01_harimari_fort_title:0 "The Harimari Fortress"
 Y01_harimari_fort_desc:0 "Of all the squabbling city-states of Yanshen, there is perhaps none other like Hubao. The decrepit corpse of the old harimari empire, the statelet has managed to retain a vestige of its predecessor's organization and is capable of, even now, mustering armies strong enough to give our probing forces pause. We need to stomp them out now, while they are unable to defeat a true oni army."
 Y01_expel_rebellious_title:0 "Expel the Rebellious"
 Y01_expel_rebellious_desc:0 "The harimari of these new lands are some of the staunchest followers of the foreign "High Philosophy", their heraldry immediately recognizable from the countless expeditions they have led against the oni. Even now they conspire to remove our rule. Expel the harimari, expunge them and replace them with subjects who will be more pliable to our regime."
 Y01_direct_control_tribute_title:0 "Direct Control of Tributaries"
 Y01_direct_control_tribute_desc:0 "The lords of Yuanszi have been wise enough to bring tribute to Azjakuma, prostrating themselves and bearing gifts. There is nothing wrong with this. However, with the threat of the Command looming, their strength must be fully joined to ours. They will understand, in due time."
 Y01_expand_record_keeping_title:0 "Expand Record Keeping"
 Y01_expand_record_keeping_desc:0 "One of the prides of the oni is our extensive record-keeping, dating back millennia. Any work, any event, of interest to the kingdom has been logged and stored - and, unlike the efforts of a certain group, it has stayed intact. Yet the organization of these works is haphazard, improvised, a temporary solution pretending to be a permanent one. These records will need to be sorted out and well organized if they are to be of any use."
 Y01_ajgriijarul_training_title:0 "Ajgriijarul Training"
 Y01_ajgriijarul_training_desc:0 "The Shirgrii of the Ajgriijarul are some of the strongest warriors in Haless, perhaps even in all of Halann. If one so desired, they might well tear a human in half, or rip their head off and take the spine with it. More than just simple raw strength, though, the Ajgriijarul understand warfare very intimately. Their displays of violence and bloodshed seem mindless, even chaotic, but this cannot be further from the truth: each gruesome death is carefully choreographed in order to create the most intimidating warrior possible.\n\nAlthough they are too few to form our entire army, coaxing them to share their secrets by training the less-skilled will afford us an invaluable asset."
 Y01_chumijemoya_spymasters_title:0 "Chumijemoya Spymasters"
 Y01_chumijemoya_spymasters_desc:0 "The Chumijemoya are incredibly effective spymasters. There is little more to be said about them, for there is nowhere their ears cannot reach, and a grudge from them is lethal indeed. They are something of an anomaly, to put it politely, for there are no other oni able to rival their ability to gather information - masters of extortion, torture, domination magic, and simple contact networks, little stays unknown by them if they desire to know it. However, their position has brought them to become indolent in recent years - no more! Their services shall be put to the use of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] without a moment's delay!"
 Y01_infiltrate_eunuch_council_title:0 "Infiltrating Heiyukcheng"
 Y01_infiltrate_eunuch_council_desc:0 "The so-called "Eternal Council" of Jinqiu are squatters, looters, and vultures beyond measure. The very land they attempt to rule over is the former domain of the Khelorvalshi, a Shirgrii considered extinct, made exclusively of banished oni. More than a few of these were banished for academic reasons - that is to say, they peddled in knowledge befitting not even the oni. The eunuchs of Jinqiu have doubtlessly seized their research and turned it to their own twisted ends; namely, so that even without a dynasty, they may live forever.\n\nSuch greed does not come without cost, however. They are greedy, capricious, and manipulable. To send the Chumijemoya after them will be an affair that is almost too easy, and even simpler still to corrupt their council and drag it down to where it belongs."
 Y01_cursed_souls_khelorvalshi_title:0 "Cursed Souls of Khelorvalshi"
 Y01_cursed_souls_khelorvalshi_desc:0 "The Khelorvalshi have evolved following their collective banishment, having absorbed their surroundings to create a Shirgrii as unique as any other, a Shirgrii of madmen, lunatics, and maniacs - but resourceful, scholastic, and inventive as well. Obviously, they could threaten the established social order of the oni. Yet, even so, they present an opportunity, should the reward for the risk prove sufficient."
 Y01_restoring_khelorvalshi_title:0 "Restoring Khelorvalshi"
 Y01_restoring_khelorvalshi_desc:0 "Khelorvalshi, named for the Shirgrii that resided within, has finally had its time come. The city has been left in ruins, considered cursed and looted by scavengers and 'adventurers' alike. The oni have no such qualms about resettling their own lands, for it is cursed only for our lesser rivals. A permanent settlement will enable Azjakuma to survey what has been lost."
 Y01_khelorvalshi_libraries_title:0 "Khelorvalshi Libraries"
 Y01_khelorvalshi_libraries_desc:0 "The greatest reward for the resettlement of Khelorvalshi is easily its libraries - vast stores of knowledge remain hidden within its boundaries, the manifests and codices certainly considered too cursed to tamper with. Renovating the city further will give us free leave to pilfer the knowledge within and record it within our own state libraries, whilst leaving the Shirgrii without this potentially-destabilizing information."
 Y01_way_forward_title:0 "The Way Forward"
 Y01_way_forward_desc:0 "What will become of the Oni? As the matters of state become more than that of managing squabbling clans, and as Azjakuma must spend more of its time governing and exploiting new subjects over tending to the Demon Hills, this question only becomes more intense. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] chafes, for the Shirgrii jealously guard old privileges even as they become anathema to the new Azjakuma. Perhaps one last meeting of the Tagharoghi will do us well..."
 Y01_bring_birb_to_heel_title:0 "Bring the Bird Riders to Heel"
 Y01_bring_birb_to_heel_desc:0 "The terrorbird riders, infamous raiders and fanatical warriors, have proven themselves a menace once more. United under the auspices of an enigmatic new queen, their mounted hosts march in ever-greater numbers and with ever-better discipline. Indeed, if they are allowed to muster their forces to match their potential and given the resources to supply them, the age of the bird might well dawn soon.\n\nThere is one critical weakness these birds possess, however - they require a specialized feed that requires the use of cereals. Should their grain-producing lands be seized, then their forces will surely be starved out. See it done."
 Y01_winning_over_birb_title:0 "Winning Over the Shuvüüsh"
 Y01_winning_over_birb_desc:0 "No sound individual would say that the Shuvüüsh would accept us easily - indeed, to the Righteous Path we are all the foulest demons, embodying everything wrong with the world. The Shuvüüsh, an example of piety, would obviously be vehemently against our rule. Of course, all mortals might be corrupted. The rejection of the oni is not total, and that is opportunity enough to creep in."
 Y01_birb_auxillaries_title:0 "Bird Rider Auxillaries"
 Y01_birb_auxillaries_desc:0 "Patience brings success. A not insignificant amount of the Shuvüüsh have come around to our rule, swayed by security and stability - under the yoke, obviously. They contribute their dues, pay taxes, participate in state-sponsored functions, and, most importantly, have stopped trying to hide from conscription duties. A unit of Lefthand bird-riders have been prepared and armed, ready to serve as auxiliaries for our forces."
 Y01_breadbasket_north_title:0 "Breadbasket of the North"
 Y01_breadbasket_north_desc:0 "The grain-producing Shuvüüsh lands are incredibly fertile and resilient, requiring far less effort to keep the crops grown strong. With the newfound support base, it is obvious that the lands need to be exploited to their fullest. The food provided will ensure that the oni population may continue to grow even if all other sources of sustenance are snuffed out. Similarly, the increased output will allow for more soldiers to be raised."
 Y01_adapting_oni_state_title:0 "Adapting the Oni State"
 Y01_adapting_oni_state_desc:0 "The single fatal flaw of the oni is our natural isolation. Numbers notwithstanding, most tend to congregate into Shirgrii and tend to their own villages and towns, paying little regard for the affairs of others. As shown by recent successes, it is only by mixing the Shirgrii that the oni can survive. New cities, new roads, the state shall be adapted to mend these flaws. A series of new, planned cities will serve to connect the oni better than ever before."
 Y01_teimarji_spring_title:0 "The Teimarji Spring"
 Y01_teimarji_spring_desc:0 "Teimarji is a glowing blue rock which enhances an individual's magical power. When properly treated, the now black substance can do the exact opposite to great effect. However, it needs to be present to enable this - the rock only comes from the sky, and in exceedingly small amounts. Whatever can be found needs to be harvested.\n\nThe Shinukhorchi have an intrinsic link to the material, being capable of reaching out with their spirits over short distances to 'feel' for it. A deposit was discovered near the capital, creating springs of magically amplified water. Dig it up."
 Y01_kabiurgarko_tributary_title:0 "Kabiurgarko Tributaries"
 Y01_kabiurgarko_tributary_desc:0 "The Kabiurgarko are infamous for their greed, going to extreme lengths to preserve and grow their wealth. The most famous of their exploits was the creation of great record-keeping systems, meticulously recording all tribute extracted, and from where it came, in order to maximize their wealth intake. Naturally, that makes them a natural Shirgrii for tax collection. With the right deals, they can be brought around to utilize their skills to collect all that is due - and no less - from our subjects."
 Y01_golden_gates_title:0 "Golden Gates of Hokuma"
 Y01_golden_gates_desc:0 "Most people would be quick to describe themselves as pious, as righteous, as unwilling to contribute to their perceived evil. The truth of the matter is different. Cheap goods, attainable luxuries, a week's pleasure for a day's work - these are the true desires of man.\n\nMost in Haless would attest the opposite, but many would buy oni goods if they were cheap and through a merchant or middleman; for then they might pretend that what they do is righteous. Ultimately, it is all the better - for us!"
 Y01_defend_north_title:0 "Defend the North"
 Y01_defend_north_desc:0 "All other matters have simply bought time; the only defense is offense. The hobgoblins grow impatient with us, frustrated and angry at our continued sovereignty. If we were to allow the Command to have its way, the oni would be ground to dust under a legion of hobgoblin boots - but that is a delusion born of false strength.\n\nShatter the command, show them that no discipline can stop them from being lesser! Send their broken bodies back into the mountains, never to return!"
 Y01_aikogeoke_title:0 "Aikogeoke"
 Y01_aikogeoke_desc:0 "The lands known as Aikogeoke, conveniently shaped similarly to one of our own internal provinces, have remained uncontrolled for centuries. The lands are a substantial distance from any Shirgrii, and until now none have seen anything desirable in those sparse, pastoral lands.\n\nWith the world rumbling with change, this too must come to an end. Instead of any Shirgrii, the state itself shall take an interest in these lands. It shall provide a formidable border fort, and perhaps even a redoubt against any invading forces."

 #####COLUMN 1#####
 Y01_southern_rethagi_title:0 "A Southern Rethagi"
 Y01_southern_rethagi_desc:0 "The southern extent of Yanshen is covered in large expanses of jungle, owing to its proximity to the Lupulan. It is a stubborn land, for foliage can regrow very quickly. Because of this, administrating the area has proven difficult - delays in communication are frequent, and roads are often discovered to be inoperable. The terrain also makes guerilla operations against our agents difficult to combat.\n\nDecentralizing the administration would make the area easier to govern, at least until taming the plant life is plausible; a Rethagi might be able to exploit the region more efficiently - reintegration would be out of the question, though."
 Y01_down_the_coast_title:0 "Down the Coast"
 Y01_down_the_coast_desc:0 "The Yanshen coast is one of the most important areas of the region, linking it to the outside world in a manner that is safe year-round. If the coast is seized, it would deeply hamper any attempts to aid dissidents, as well as bolstering the treasury. Conversion will be a persistent problem, but it will probably be fine - a convert by the sword might not be a true believer, but their children often are."
 Y01_converting_the_south_title:0 "The Southern Faithful"
 Y01_converting_the_south_desc:0 "With the Righteous Path nearly utterly stamped out in Yanshen, the area is finally coming around to obedience. Where rebels might have once found friends or at least silence, they are now being turned in or exposed by their fellows. The area pays its taxes, contributes its soldiers, and there are no more grand conspiracies to repel the oni."
 Y01_jewel_of_the_yanhe_title:0 "The Jewel of the Yanhe"
 Y01_jewel_of_the_yanhe_desc:0 "Who on this side of the world doesn't know about Tianlou? There is not a single city as large, as productive, as brimming with simple potential as this one. Now, all of that belongs to the oni. What better monument exists to our eternal victory?\n\nMore importantly, Tianlou also hosts the greatest of all the temple complexes, the keystone of the entire system..."
 Y01_tamotch_of_yan_title:0 "Tamotch of Yan"
 Y01_tamotch_of_yan_desc:0 "With the final victory of the Lefthand Path in Yanshen, the situation has finally developed such that our success might finally be savored. Indeed, there will be no untimely assassinations - very few humans would think such a thing even possible anymore. Previously delayed due to an inability to celebrate, it is now time to declare the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as the Tamotch of Yan - the emperor of all Yanshen.\n\nAn emperor requires only the greatest coronation. With the new loyal subject base, exactly such a thing can be carried out. Let them know that the oni are here to stay..."
 Y01_temples_of_yanshen_title:0 "The Temples of Yanshen"
 Y01_temples_of_yanshen_desc:0 "Every temple in Yanshen is under oni domination, with most resistance around the area exterminated. Not all of it can be exterminated short of outright murdering every non-oni nearby - which, while tempting, is simply unfeasible. As a result, it will be necessary to have individuals to guard the temples. No individual other than an oni, with a stake in the protection of these corrupted complexes, can be trusted to protect these structures. With all of them firmly under our dominion, now is a better time than any to establish a protection force for the complexes."

 #####COLUMN 2#####
 Y01_tyrants_of_yanshen_title:0 "The Tyrants of the Yanhe"
 Y01_tyrants_of_yanshen_desc:0 "There is one state on the Yanhe river that could pose a threat to Azjakuma - Bianfang. Make no mistake, they are no match for the oni as it currently stands, but they are more than a match for their neighbors. If allowed to expand, their ability to utilize the resources of the area could prove disastrous in maintaining a secure border. Destroy them preemptively, such as to avoid any opportunity for opportunism."
 Y01_bianfang_faithful_title:0 "The Bianfang Faithful"
 Y01_bianfang_faithful_desc:0 "So long as the humans follow the "Righteous" Path, oni rule will never be accepted. The only way to fully stomp out their resistance is to indoctrinate them into the Lefthand Path. That is the point when the humans will accept Azjakuma as their rightful rulers, and the necessity of our deeds will be given due consideration."
 Y01_league_of_schemers_title:0 "The Schemers League"
 Y01_league_of_schemers_desc:0 "The Yanzhin league is infamous - even we, isolated and aloof from the politics of outsiders, are well-aware of its ability to plot and scheme. By means of wealth and many, many connections, the league possesses an aptitude for intrigue unmatched by any except the Chumijemoya (though that is no affair worth testing until success is a certain thing). To reinforce that matter, this league is more-than-likely the orchestrator of the old conqueror Jaher's death. Those days are long past, but based on the difficulty of gathering information, the expertise clearly isn't. There is only one solution then: Force of arms!"
 Y01_yanszin_title:0 "Yanszin Followers"
 Y01_yanszin_desc:0 "The greatest advantage the Lefthand Path could ever confer in foreign lands is submission to our rule. Its central tenet is of power - to subscribe to the Path means, by definition, that one must seek power in all forms available. This has created the curious side-effect of subservience in our human subjects, the popular interpretation being that working for Azjakuma, which is a state dedicated to the accumulation of power, is the best choice. It is an odd phenomenon.\n\nRegardless, it has most definitely worked. The Kabiurgarko, armed with a wide breadth of informants, assistants, and outright traitors, has managed to destroy the Yanzhin league. They, being experts at corrupting the hearts of men, were able to create a network large enough to first slow, then entirely suffocate the League's operations."
 Y01_down_the_river_title:0 "Down the River"
 Y01_down_the_river_desc:0 "The Yanhe river is the heart of Yanshen. If it is captured, then every important part of Yanshen will fall alongside it. Every major population center and nearly every upstart takes their lifeblood from the impressively large river, using it in equal parts for food, water, and commerce.\n\nIf we were to conquer along the Yanhe and establish control there, then any remaining unpacified areas could be starved into submission. Likewise, any traders opting to try exchanging their wares - and there will most definitely be at least a few, demon rule or no - will bolster the treasury through river tolls."
 Y01_river_followers_title:0 "The Jiangszun Followers"
 Y01_river_followers_desc:0 "When presented with a seemingly innocuous conversion or death, most prefer to convert to the Lefthand Path. It is not a hard thing to adapt to - the worst resistance comes from most being unwilling to cooperate with oni, at least at first. Here is where the true conversion begins.\n\nTo follow a religion of power is to seek power, and to that end we have been careful to prepare ways to find power. Incentives for rooting out false believers, rewards for high-level collaboration, and token gifts for showing kindness to oni; all of these are simple temptations of greed, and to accept them marks one's full conversion. It is all the better if one can fabricate evidence of these events - for that simple avarice marks their fall better than anything else."
 Y01_true_oni_leader_title:0 "An Oni Mage"
 Y01_true_oni_leader_desc:0 "Most [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Azjakuma have been mages to some degree or another, just not always to the extent required for it to be of note. Many of her greatest rulers have been legendarily powerful mages, working great rituals to perform one deed or another.\n\nIt is about time to perform one such ritual. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must be an incredibly talented mage, proficient at least in all forms of magic. Nothing less than this level of familiarity with magic will prove sufficient to complete our aims."
 Y01_rituals_of_khelorvalshi_title:0 "Rituals of Khelorvalshi"
 Y01_rituals_of_khelorvalshi_desc:0 "The Khelorvalshi manipulate the energies of the soul. More specifically, they manipulate the chi of the soul - an important distinction. When one considers that it is the chi specifically that they manipulate, many opportunities open up to the state. The temples, likewise, can be manipulated to drain the chi of the spirits under their jurisdiction.\n\nWith the correct rituals, that excess chi can be directed into means more productive to the state..."
 Y01_the_centerpiece_title:0 "The Centerpiece"
 Y01_the_centerpiece_desc:0 "The temple in Tianlou is the greatest of them all, and the center temple of the entire system. If it can be corrupted for the oni, then it would ensure that every other can be adjusted similarly. Strength belongs to those willing to take it. This is no different."
 Y01_eternal_tamongor_title:0 "An Eternal [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 Y01_eternal_tamongor_desc:0 "Finally, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been given the chi required to become fully immortal, for now it is finally entering their body at a rate equivalent to the speed at which it is used. Any less and they would die, any more and it would slowly accumulate - the perfect amount was difficult to divine.\n\nInitially, it was very painful. However, the constant exposure has raised the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s tolerance, allowing them to be the conduit necessary for some truly great rituals..."

 #####COLUMN 3#####
 Y01_precursor_temples_title:0 "The Precursor's Temples"
 Y01_precursor_temples_desc:0 "The precursors created many large temple complexes all across Haless, each individual complex a part of a much larger network dedicated to stopping the native spirits of Haless from running loose. How specifically this is done is beyond our scope of knowledge - but we do know it involves a structure at the heart of each complex. When the correct rituals are performed, these temples can be manipulated to perform whatever we desire to the spirits of the surrounding countryside."
 Y01_new_purpose_title:0 "A New Purpose"
 Y01_new_purpose_desc:0 "Even though suppressing the spirits of Haless is ostensibly a wise idea, the fact of the matter is that it is utterly and woefully inefficient. Our intervention allows these temples to instead drain the chi of the spirits, leaving it fully prepared to be redirected to magical rituals as needed - indeed, in some respects it is superior to teimarji!"
 Y01_temple_of_lamwun_title:0 "The Temple of Lamwun"
 Y01_temple_of_lamwun_desc:0 "Many monks of the "Righteous" Path rightfully see the corrupted temples as the most direct way to strike at our power. They, upon gazing upon our means, would rather see the temples rendered permanently inoperable than suffer them to be used by the oni. Adequate resources need to be apportioned to defend these temples. In the temple-complex of Lamuwan, a garrison of elite - but loyal - oni will be required to properly guard the complex. We should resettle enough of the oni there to make such a garrison feasible."
 Y01_monks_of_jianxusi_title:0 "The Monks of Jianxusi"
 Y01_monks_of_jianxusi_desc:0 "Jianxusi is a stretch of land that is not only important for its symbolic value, but for the resources within. The land has many rich deposits of teimarji, being only partially exploited to their furthest extent. To capture those would be a boon to both the rituals possible and to the treasury, for the Shirgrii will pay richly for scraps of teimarji.\n\nMore importantly than that, it is the home of the blade stewards of Kongren, the ancestral blade. No other justification is needed! Seize our rightful sword!"
 Y01_teimarji_mines_title:0 "Teimarji Mines"
 Y01_teimarji_mines_desc:0 "As previously mentioned, the teimarji mines of Jianxusi are woefully underutilized. The deposits in the area are vast and will not run out for quite some time, even when factoring in the increased yield. If more teimarji were coming out of the province, there would be all the more to use in korashi production..."
 Y01_demon_warriors_title:0 "Demon Warriors"
 Y01_demon_warriors_desc:0 "Even though the government has made great strides in exerting control over the Shirgrii, there still remain isolated communities of oni. With no particular affiliation, these oni are reclusive yet powerful warriors. Under their tutelage, even humans might fight like demons.\n\nIf given some formal support by the state, these oni could train auxiliaries of ever-greater ability."
 Y01_shadows_of_khappur_title:0 "Shadows of Khappur"
 Y01_shadows_of_khappur_desc:0 "Khappur was, not too long ago, controlled by an order of shadows - a group known as The Nightblades. This group's claim to fame is of assassinations, utilizing an art known as the Way of the Hidden Knives. In short, they are capable of creating undetectable death traps which are often able to kill their target without needing an assassin present to perform the deed.\n\nWhy any of this matters is simple: this organization has pledged its allegiance to our state, provided we can ensure they operate in Khappur unopposed. Their skill in assassination, combined with an ability to infiltrate, makes them incredibly competent saboteurs for fortified locations. We should make use of them."
 Y01_final_subjugation_title:0 "The Final Subjugation"
 Y01_final_subjugation_desc:0 "Sometimes, the process of corrupting and pacifying an area does not go according to plan. Other times, however, things work exactly as planned. In this case, it has gone precisely according to plan - the schedule for pacifying Xianjie has been followed to the day. Some resistance remains, as is to be expected, but on the whole it is ineffective. The greatest enemy of the oni - subjugated! There might be other enemies on the horizon that must be given battle, yet for now we can celebrate our triumph over Haless."
 Y01_inu_tamokuma_title:0 "Inu Ekuesnambi"
 Y01_inu_tamokuma_desc:0 "The old oni records speak of monstrous, grand things. Rituals whose power could shake the very foundations of the world. Yet one stands above the rest. The Ekuesnambi - even its name radiates power. What it means has been lost to time. What it does, similarly, cannot be found. Only that it requires many things, many many things. With these conditions fulfilled, we can perform the Ekuesnambi. It has only been performed once before, and whatever it did was sufficient to drive off the old precursors...\n\nIt will be beneficial for the oni, whatever it is - that is why it has been performed before. The road to preparing the ritual is a difficult one, but that does not matter. Strength belongs to those with the will to seize it."

 #####COLUMN 4#####
 Y01_yanhe_buffer_title:0 "A Buffer on the Yanhe"
 Y01_yanhe_buffer_desc:0 "The Yanhe river was previously an admirable natural border between the Demon Hills and the Command, but now the lands along it have grown to be a part of our heartland, and so they must be defended like a heartland too. To do that, new buffer lands will be needed across the river, a land that can be cast aside during war without as severe of a consequence. The countryside of Shamakhad will do well enough."
 Y01_quashing_dissent_title:0 "Quashing Dissent"
 Y01_quashing_dissent_desc:0 "Much dissent can be quashed by proper incentive and brutal reprisal, but sometimes these efforts are insufficient, or worse - inefficient. Sometimes there are problems so significant that they require magical intervention. With the increased supply of teimarji, the threshold for significant problems can be lowered drastically.\n\nWith the resources necessary to brute-force larger spells, the Ajgriijaril would have us consider large-scale sorcery, such that rebellions might tear themselves apart long before they give battle..."
 Y01_xiaodao_title:0 "Seizing the Origin"
 Y01_xiaodao_desc:0 "Xiaodao hosts the origin of the Yanhe river. The benefits of holding such land should be obvious - it makes operating within the area much easier by expanding the lines-of-communication. There is a clear strategic advantage to controlling it."
 Y01_yuanszi_governance_title:0 "Yuanszi Governance"
 Y01_yuanszi_governance_desc:0 "Even when superficially pacified, the Xia has proven a strong adversary. There remains no formal military to oppose Azjakuma in these lands, and yet the locals put up a spirited resistance. In no other place in Haless will individuals continue on as stubbornly - no matter how many examples are made, there always seem to be a few more individuals committing treason against the state immediately after. Why waste oni lives on it? Surely there are enough collaborators to sufficiently decentralize and stabilize the area."
 Y01_finishing_blow_title:0 "Finishing Blow"
 Y01_finishing_blow_desc:0 "The states of the Xia are insufficient to stop the oni. Their best efforts have been put forward already, and their zenith was obviously not enough. With every province taken, a number of irrelevant monastic orders are slaughtered in their resistance, bringing their retinues along with them and bolstering our treasury with the spoils. Each monk-fiefdom brought low is another army that the Xia cannot muster against us - and they already do not have enough! Kill them all.\n\nShow our ages-old enemy that resistance is futile, and that every slight goes repaid. Once their armies have been slaughtered, punishment will begin in earnest. Uproot everything of note, every piece of infrastructure that can be found. Hand it out to the Shirgrii. They will handle it much better than the Xia ever could."
 Y01_great_shirgrii_title:0 "The Great Shirgrii"
 Y01_great_shirgrii_desc:0 "Senukagrii was once a remarkable library, and even in its dilapidated state that greatness may still be seen. Restoring it will not be quick, nor will it be cheap. However, if the library were to be fully restored, it would mean access to its extensive records complex, where many valuable things might be regained for the oni..."
 Y01_masterful_tamongor_title:0 "An Oni [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 Y01_masterful_tamongor_desc:0 "What does it mean to be a tamongor? It might seem to be just a simple title, but it is so much more than that - to be a tamongor is to be the most qualified ruler of all the oni - perhaps of all individuals in the world. More importantly than that, it appears that a tamongor in the truest sense is necessary for the Ekuesnambi; any lesser individual would die in the attempt to channel the power it would certainly conjure. Similarly, the position of tamongor holds certain privileges regarding land, though that is perhaps simply a modern invention..."

 #####COLUMN 5#####
 Y01_infiltrate_sir_title:0 "Infiltrate Sir"
 Y01_infiltrate_sir_desc:0 "Even though the hobgoblins would prefer that the rest of the world did not notice, and are even in denial of it themselves, the land of Sir is still a hotbed of resistance. The rebellious elements there might have lost a confrontation on the open field with the Command, but that does not mean that they are defeated.\n\nOnly a truly deluded government, such as that of the hobgoblins, would assume that a land need only be subjugated on the battlefield.

Already the sages and monks that were forced to flee have returned to the citadel, and may damnation befall us all if it were to fall again."
 flavor_azjakuma.2510.a:0 "May her fires never be snuffed again!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2511.t:0 "Chumijemoya Restored"
 flavor_azjakuma.2511.d:0 "Thanks in no small part to the plotting and plans of her rightful inhabitants, the hidden temple of Chumijemoya has been pried from the hands of our enemies. The damage from the battle is already being repaired as the temple's inhabitants take stock of the scrolls housed within, destroying any that may have been read by the occupiers."
 flavor_azjakuma.2511.a:0 "Hopefully it won't take too long."
 flavor_azjakuma.2512.t:0 "Ajgriijarul Restored"
 flavor_azjakuma.2512.d:0 "The moment the gates were opened, they appeared from the mists, the enraged warriors of Ajgriijarul. Shoving past our armies they tore into their restored home, eager to seek revenge on those that stole it from them. They may be busy for quite some time, and the citadel will surely need cleaning, but at long last we have regained the Shirgrii."
 flavor_azjakuma.2512.a:0 "They'll settle down eventually."
 flavor_azjakuma.2513.t:0 "Kabiurgarko Restored"
 flavor_azjakuma.2513.d:0 "Across Azjakuma celebrations arise as the golden gates of Kabiurgarko lay within our hands once again. Assisted by human agents within the citadel, our armies took it with minimal damage to the structure, much to the delight of the inhabitants that have swiftly returned to their vast stashes of wealth."
 flavor_azjakuma.2513.a:0 "Let the gold flow!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2514.t:0 "Khelorvalshi Restored"
 flavor_azjakuma.2514.d:0 "When we stormed back into Khelorvalshi we were expecting an occupying force. Instead we were met with the original Oni inhabitants, carrying on as if nothing had happened and claiming that they had always been there. Whatever the case, the secrets of Khelorvalshi are now ours once again."
 flavor_azjakuma.2514.a:0 "I have many questions."
 flavor_azjakuma.2520.t:0 "Fall of Shinukhorchi"
 flavor_azjakuma.2520.d:0 "The grandest of all the Shirgrii, Shinukhorchi has stood since time immemorial as the capital of our people. Now we must despair, for the ancient citadel has been wrested from us by our enemies, the wise sages of the temple having scattered to the countryside and the remaining Shirgrii. The future of Azjakuma appears bleak."
 flavor_azjakuma.2520.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2521.t:0 "Fall of Chumijemoya"
 flavor_azjakuma.2521.d:0 "The hidden temple of Chumijemoya has fallen, the inhabitants slaughtered as they tried to hide the secret documents and scrolls housed within. Already the survivors have joined the remaining Shirgrii, plotting the restoration of their bastion. The future of Azjakuma is uncertain."
 flavor_azjakuma.2521.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2522.t:0 "Fall of Ajgriijarul"
 flavor_azjakuma.2522.d:0 "Many armies have tried to destroy Ajgriijarul, and just as many have faltered and become just another bloodstain on its walls. Today though, the citadel has met its match. Its defenders fought with ferocity and bravery, not giving up an inch of their home without a fight. Though most of the warriors fell in battle, what few survivors there were scattered throughout the countryside, angrily assaulting all that approach them. The future of Azjakuma hangs in the balance."
 flavor_azjakuma.2522.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2523.t:0 "Fall of Kabiurgarko"
 flavor_azjakuma.2523.d:0 "The shining walls of Kabiurgarko have been stained with blood as our enemies have rampaged through its halls, looting its great vaults and desecrating its grounds. The few that managed to escape have flocked to their sister Shirgrii, zealously scheming the reclamation of their wealth. The future of Azjakuma is dark."
 flavor_azjakuma.2523.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2524.t:0 "Fall of Khelorvalshi"
 flavor_azjakuma.2524.d:0 "The restored Shirgrii of Khelorvalshi has fallen once again, invaders storming its blackened halls and attempting to breach the forbidden vaults. The Oni within the temple seem to have vanished, disappearing without a trace as the gates were blown open. Wherever they went, their taboo wisdom is no longer at our disposal. The future of Azjakuma is unknown."
 flavor_azjakuma.2524.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2600.t:0 "Where is Kongren?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2600.d:0 "Kongren, a blade made out of specially prepared korashi, is normally kept in a unique shrine, guarded by a "Righteous" Path religious order. During the initial invasion, orders were directed specifically to capture this shrine, slaughter the monks, and seize the sword before they could move it elsewhere. This did not happen.\n\nThe monks are at an unknown location, having taken the blade with them. Now, we will need to find it and then finally seize it for ourselves."
 flavor_azjakuma.2600.a:0 "Nothing matters more than getting me that blade."
 flavor_azjakuma.2600.b:0 "Find it!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2600.c:0 "Perhaps the Chumijemoya could leverage their specialty..."
 flavor_azjakuma.2601.t:0 "Kongren - Still Missing!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2601.d:0 "The first efforts to locate the blade have failed. Even though our agents could buy the locations of strongholds out of certain individuals, they could never buy silence - at least, that would explain why every hidden sanctuary we came across was deserted. There are probably more, the product of a frightened order. At this point, it would likely be more efficient to simply turn over every building we could find for Kongren."
 flavor_azjakuma.2601.a:0 "Sigh... some things never change. Keep looking!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2601.b:0 "Every house? I'm sure the Chumijemoya could do less than a tenth."
 flavor_azjakuma.2602.t:0 "Kongren - The Planning Phase"
 flavor_azjakuma.2602.d:0 "With the actual blade located, preparations to seize it have finally been able to begin. The actual planning has been left confidential, yet even so this has not stopped a flurry of less-than-ideal plans. The most obvious choice is to fight our way into the shrine and claim the sword over the dead bodies of its protectors. However, they do not know that an assault is being prepared, so it is not yet impossible to sneak in and claim the blade. Perhaps even both are possible, if you feel so bold. What seems best?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2602.a:0 "We'll take it, just like that!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2602.b:0 "Let them guard a blade we have long since claimed."
 flavor_azjakuma.2602.c:0 "Why not both? The best plans are multi-layered."
 flavor_azjakuma.2602.e:0 "I can use Domination magic - they will hand it over freely."
 flavor_azjakuma.2603.t:0 "Kongren - The Triumph of the Oni"
 flavor_azjakuma.2603.d:0 "Kongren is ours - the ancient blade, back to its rightful owners! Before a cheering crowd, [Root.Monarch.GetName] drew Kongren, pointing its glistening black blade towards the sky like a sixth finger. All oni present could recognize its significance, of what its mere presence meant for the oni race - of the greatness it was achieving.\n\nIndeed, its efficacy was quickly demonstrated. Four former blade-keepers were lined up and decapitated (after a brief delay, for the blade was ill-balanced for oni hands), their blood channeled into the illusion of a small dragon. To a cheering crowd, [Root.Monarch.GetName] held the blade up...\n\n...and cleaved the spell in half."
 flavor_azjakuma.2603.a:0 "Our dominion is nigh! First Xianjie, then Haless!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2604.t:0 "Kongren - A Quiet Ceremony"
 flavor_azjakuma.2604.d:0 "A group of oni barge into a spontaneously hushed court, bearing between them what appears to be a scabbard wrapped in bloody rags. With a practiced reverence, they kneel, unraveling the cloth with a single gentle hand. Then, the central oni holds it forwards - towards [Root.Monarch.GetName]\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s footsteps echoed, so clear was the room of noise. There, they slowly pulled Kongren out of its scabbard, jerking the small blade up straight, Moving so quickly as to make a woosh of air, [Root.Monarch.GetName] slid the blade back into its scabbard, taking the entire thing - rags and all - and holding it in their hands."
 flavor_azjakuma.2604.a:0 "What I hold is our legacy... and our future."
 flavor_azjakuma.2605.t:0 "Kongren - Rebuffed!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2605.d:0 "The blade stewards have managed to elude our plans to retrieve Kongren! There was no word of their failure until early the next morning - where the severed heads of oni were proudly displayed upon pikes. It is no secret that this entire expedition has been exceptionally expensive, and though pride is worth much, it might be cheaper to sacrifice our pride and allow the stewards to flee, though we won't get another chance at finding the sword.\n\nBut you don't want that, do you?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2605.a:0 "Obviously not. Money is ephemeral; that sword isn't."
 flavor_azjakuma.2605.b:0 "What good is Kongren if we are bankrupt?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2606.t:0 "The Oni Have Seized Kongren!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2606.d:0 "Terrible news! The oni have seized Kongren, their ancient blade! It is hard to say what happened to the blade stewards, but it doesn't seem to have been good - four of them, presumably the last of the order, were publicly beheaded in a ritual ceremony. This heralds bad tidings - who knows what they can do with that blade?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2606.a:0 "We must fight!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2607.t:0 "The Oni Have Seized Kongren!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2607.d:0 "The oni have seized Kongren! Escaped members of the blade stewards have told the harrowing tale of the battles that took place in their refuge-shrine, and of the heroic resistance given that day. Many died, but that tally does include oni. After all was said and done, the horned dogs slinked off without any further comment."
 flavor_azjakuma.2607.a:0 "Their memory shall live on!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2608.t:0 "Failed Assault on The Blade Stewards!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2608.d:0 "The oni, seeking to steal the ancient sword Kongren, have attacked the order of blade stewards! For a time, the battle was contentious, but the sanctuary-fortresses are well provisioned for such an affair. The oni raiding group have been driven back, tails between their legs and without Kongren. Even so, the stewards have sent out requests for more volunteers to reinforce their stand. Perhaps now is the time to drive the oni back?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2608.a:0 "We must do what we can."
 flavor_azjakuma.2650.t:0 "The Yuanszi"
 flavor_azjakuma.2650.d:0 "Even though the oni rule of Yuanszi is an inevitable conclusion, there are a number of methods to achieve that goal.\n\nThe first is to demand their submission as an effective vassal-state, where we might exert control of their government as necessary, and perhaps later integrate them into the greater administration.\n\nAlternatively, we might bring them into the fold as a Rethagi, an area akin to a viceroyalty ruled by a human governor under oni supervision. Though we could not integrate them further without considerable effort, they would not be considered a diplomatic relationship.\n\nThen again, there is always conquest..."
 flavor_azjakuma.2650.a:0 "Demand they submit as a vassal"
 flavor_azjakuma.2650.b:0 "Demand they submit as a Rethagi"
 flavor_azjakuma.2650.c:0 "We will conquer them directly"
 flavor_azjakuma.2651.t:0 "The Oni Demand Submission"
 flavor_azjakuma.2651.d:0 "The lords of Azjakuma demand our subjugation! Should we agree to their terms, the country would be put at the mercy of their whims. What means more to us, our honor or our lives?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2651.a:0 "We have no choice"
 flavor_azjakuma.2651.b:0 "We prosper only because of our independence"
 flavor_azjakuma.2652.t:0 "Yuanszi Accepts Our Demand"
 flavor_azjakuma.2652.d:0 "Yuanszi has proclaimed itself at the mercy of our whims! The planned integration of their state is already underway, a party of oni magistrates sent back alongside their diplomatic corps."
 flavor_azjakuma.2652.a:0 "Good."
 flavor_azjakuma.2653.t:0 "Yuanszi Rejects Our Demand"
 flavor_azjakuma.2653.d:0 "A diplomat from Yuanszi appeared before the court, hushing the procedures with loud, defiant tones. He proclaimed that freedom was greater than any chance at survival. With the court watching, he was promptly beheaded - and the rest of their state will follow!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2653.a:0 "They will regret this"
 flavor_azjakuma.2654.t:0 "Governance of Southern Yanshen"
 flavor_azjakuma.2654.d:0 "You have been given some time to consider, mighty lord. No matter the solution, the magistrates will be quick to implement it. What will it be - shall the operation of the region be left to another?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2654.a:0 "Yes, I want to see a Rethagi established."
 flavor_azjakuma.2654.b:0 "Very well, then. Hand the area off to another."
 flavor_azjakuma.2654.c:0 "Actually, I think we can make this work..."
 flavor_azjakuma.2655.t:0 "Yanzhin League"
 flavor_azjakuma.2655.d:0 "The Yanzhin League is an implacable bunch. Even after the state has long since been annihilated, their agents continue to strike and harass our agents. This is no matter of harassment and hostility - this betrays a calculated and highly organized attempt to drive out our magistrates and collaborators. Attempting to wrestle any worthwhile value out of these lands is a waste of time, at least until the League can be fully destroyed. Is it worth the investment?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2655.a:0 "We shall directly control the temple complexes. The rest shall belong to a Rethagi..."
 flavor_azjakuma.2655.b:0 "The government of Yingshi will be easy to reconfigure into a Rethagi..."
 flavor_azjakuma.2655.c:0 "Why would I give away land that will be perfectly usable in only a few decades at most?"
 flavor_azjakuma.2656.t:0 "Yuanszi Governance"
 flavor_azjakuma.2656.d:0 "My lord, what have you decided about Xianjie? Yuanszi would make a suitable seat of government for a new viceroyalty, if that is what you desire. Of course, the special nature of the situation there would make it difficult to re-integrate later. For that reason, we will either need to continue with direct ownership of the land or delegate it to a Rethagi."
 flavor_azjakuma.2656.a:0 "Yuanszi shall be a great city for a Rethagi."
 flavor_azjakuma.2656.b:0 "I will kill every non-oni there if that is what it takes to pacify them."
 flavor_azjakuma.2657.t:0 "Self-Governance in Shamakhad"
 flavor_azjakuma.2657.d:0 "With Sir and the surrounding lands freed from the Command, it has finally come time to consider old promises. We would never dare consider breaking a promise outright, for trust is necessary in dealmaking. That being said, of course, we never once specified what sort of autonomy they would receive.\n\nIt would be simplest to grant their promise in full, placing them as leading roles in a new Rethagi. Otherwise, we might grant them autonomy with the right to revoke it later - as a different sort of vassalage would allow. With both of these, we might simply allow them autonomy from their rebellion - integrating the lands directly and keeping the leaders somewhere harmless."
 flavor_azjakuma.2657.a:0 "It is only fair for a service well done. Establish a Rethagi."
 flavor_azjakuma.2657.b:0 "Grant them a vassalship - we can revoke it later!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2657.c:0 "Autonomy from having to rule. I like that."
 flavor_azjakuma.2700.t:0 "Rebellion in the Xia!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2700.dd:0 "Insurrection in the area is no surprise, and even expected. What we didn't realize, however, was how deep this rebellion has spread. Even though much of the region seemed ostensibly pacified, if not secure, the reality is much darker. Beginning with a monk immolating himself outside of the governor's palace, the subsequent riots were sufficient to completely nullify any control we held over the region. Most of the exiled Xiaken have come out of hiding, coordinating with one another to begin a dedicated large-scale rebellion against our government.\n\nThere can be no negotiation. Shoot them, crush them, maim them; they must die. Make no mistake, these rebels seek to annihilate our state and exterminate the oni in their entirety. Do not allow them the chance! The Xia must drown in blood before it will submit!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2700.dr:0 "The [Y89.Monarch.GetTitle] has been killed! The individual in question was murdered in their own palace, in what can only be described as a coup. Shortly after, the rogue state issued a mobilization order to every individual fit for battle. From here, the details get hazy - every oni in the region has been murdered if they have not already fled. It also appears that every rogue Xiaken has emerged from their hideouts, joining their forces to the new rogue state.\n\nThey have made a fatal mistake! There is nowhere for them to run. Burn them, shoot them, maim them - kill them all! These mongrels seek to exterminate the oni, strike first and do not give them the opportunity!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2700.a:0 "This is their final battle!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2701.t:0 "The Xia is Beaten!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2701.d:0 "After years of warfare, the last great resistance of the Xiaken has been defeated. Every local group of monk-insurgents have been exterminated, their refuges razed or left abandoned. The region has been decimated by warfare and reprisals - Xiaken monks and traitor-collaborators alike have been strung up in the gallows by the dozens, supervised by the oni and the oni alone. There are more collaborators, of course, but the days of a long leash are over. Unburied dead litter the lands, a gruesome display of the battles over the fate of the Xia. It is hard to say if the region will ever fully recover from its punishment.\n\nThen again, it is unlikely they will ever have the strength to rebel again..."
 flavor_azjakuma.2701.a:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will personally oversee the Xia."
 flavor_azjakuma.2701.b:0 "The Yuanszi will be a better fit for integrating the populace"
 flavor_azjakuma.2702.t:0 "Opportunistic Revolts"
 flavor_azjakuma.2702.d:0 "A rebellion has risen up, as revolters are taking advantage of the chaos in order to break away!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2702.a:0 "Kill Them"
 flavor_azjakuma.2801.t:0 "Scales of Gold"
 flavor_azjakuma.2801.d:0 "As oni triumphantly march through the former lands of Balrijin, it's obvious enough that to see one really is good luck, as the Yansheni say. Against the sun above, the scales of these diminutive lizards shine as brightly, if not brighter, than any regular gold bullion. From the first sight of a whole city full of the golden-scaled kobolds, the Kabiurgarko oni have wanted to take a large sum to serve as pets, both for their strangely charming demeanor and to harvest their scales for profit. There is no reason not to indulge them - it makes the land easier to govern, and leaves a Shirgrii content!"
 flavor_azjakuma.2801.a:0 "So long as they send a few of those scales my way."

 magic_korashi_talisman_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gKorashi is a special derivative of Teimarji, capable of nullifying magic directed at it similarly to how its counterpart is capable of amplifying it. The potential effects are limitless - in this case, if provided the resources to prepare sufficient amounts, the Shinukhorchi can prepare protective talismans for our soldiers, dampening or nullifying the effects of enemy war-magic.§!""
 magic_fertility_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gChildbirth is difficult. More importantly than that, there is no guarantee that the resultant offspring will be any good - countless empires have fallen because the ruler's spawn was less than desired. The Shinukhorchi offer an alternative. They will perform a rite to greatly boost the virility of our ruler, provided the materials for the deed and payment for their time. There is a chance that the rite will not work, but the resultant offspring from a successful ritual will be highly capable.§!""
 magic_vassal_domination_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gHuman minds - and most others, too - are incredibly weak-willed, vulnerable to an oni asserting their will and enforcing control over them. When we apply domination magic, we can purge any thoughts of disloyalty from the minds of our subjects, as well as making them more pliable to tribute demands. Other statelets will also be more inclined to submit themselves, too!§!""
 magic_blazing_field_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThe best way to rule is through fear. Under the threat of eternal pain, torment, and damnation, most would work quietly until the end of their days to avoid such a fate. However, few take this threat truly seriously. By stoking a fire whose fuel is souls, we might intimidate the commoners into line through the threat of the incineration of their very being.§!""
 magic_mist_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThe Chumijemoya can create the illusion of thick mist wherever we desire, given the proper compensation. Visibility is incredibly poor - only a few meters in front of one's face - and it is capable of lasting for an extended period of time. While the nature of a modern military makes it ineffective to cause casualties, the mist makes it exceptionally hard to navigate, halting most armies in their tracks.§!""
 magic_mind_control_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThe act of controlling a mind is one that many elder Chumijemoya will speak of, but will rarely carry out. This is because the process is exceptionally difficult - one's mental defenses must first be cracked and then control must be maintained. For anything greater than small nudges, this requires exponentially larger amounts of energy. Should the Shirgrii be properly compensated for their efforts, this art might be employed for our gain.§!""
 magic_spynetworks_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gIn regular circumstances, a hulking ogre makes for a poor spy. There are no regular circumstances in Azjakuma. Through the power of illusions and more magics beyond, it is possible for an oni to walk into the heart of Dihenijansar and back without being noticed. Paying the price for this service will permit us to direct it as we please towards an enemy state.§!""
 magic_fow_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThe Chumijemoya often have access to vast sums of information, and this can be amplified further by their ability to infiltrate and monitor. Should we contract their services in this manner, they shall glean information on enemy troop movements through a prolonged series of divination rituals.§!""
 magic_demon_hills_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gMore than any other Shirgrii, the Ajgriijarul understand the importance of protecting the ancestral homelands of the oni. Their zeal might be channeled into an upsurge of defensive ability in the demon hills, as magically strengthened oni arrive in key locations in order to harry and deter potential besiegers. Preparing these oni for their roles will not be free, though.§!""
 magic_dominate_unruly_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThe oni are so gifted in the matters of spirit that, given the proper preparation, their chi can shine so brightly even the magically untrained can sense their power. The Ajgriijarul can be contracted, using some small payments in kind, to perform a few displays of this power. These displays will be effective to coerce any revolting humans to return to their homes, having been convinced of the oni's power.§!""
 magic_trance_rage_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThe Ajgriijarul cultivate a magical plant known as Ekueskavari, a small and skinny leaf that, when consumed, induces a violent rage in the consumer until it has fully left their system. If provided the money to recoup the expense, a limited amount of this leaf might be distributed to our rank-and-file troops. It will make them far more effective in physical combat, at the expense of reduced self-preservation and a small increase in friendly fire.§!""
 magic_soul_ignition_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gOf course, many of the oni are capable of manipulating the souls of lessers. The Ajgriijarul are no exception. By infusing one's soul with an excess of energy, it can be bloated until the point in which it detonates, the quantity proportional to the amount of magic stored within. By sending them malcontents, prisoners, and debtors, we can shatter many walls with their deaths.§!""
 magic_production_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThe Kaiburgarko know many ways to manipulate even refined materials, making affairs such as carving, weaving, and even quarrying trivial affairs. When wood carves itself, far more can be done in a day's time than ever before. Though they will not share the specifics, they are more than willing to provide this as a service to Azjakuma - for a fee.§!""
 magic_contruction_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gMuch of the effort of construction goes into planning - finding and then preparing a site optimal for the deed, and only then being able to allocate resources. The Kaiburgarko, in their drive to exploit the land, have developed something of an instinct for the ways that materials can be manipulated to various ends. With the assistance of their mages, construction sites can often sidestep much planning through clever magical-engineering.§!""
 magic_energy_bending_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThe magnum opus of the Kaiburgarko is the spirit stones, near-perfectly polished gemstones within which they might bind a spirit. These spirits, once properly broken in, can serve several purposes for their masters - be it by forcing their energy out in an explosive burst of power or providing a convenient store of energy that any mage can draw from to use for their spellwork.§!""
 magic_metal_bending_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gActually creating the equipment an infantryman needs is the most expensive part of recruiting them, and the most time-consuming. However, magic can be used on an industrial scale to bend and shape the metal into place, creating finished equipment for a fraction of the effort. This will result in a much cheaper production process.§!""
 magic_drain_defenders_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThe Khelorvalshi are capable of draining the lifeforce of individuals from a distance, siphoning it and storing it within themselves (or other receptacles) to use as they please. In this case, it can be used to weaken the defenders of an area, sucking the moisture from their veins and the strength of their bones until their husk collapses in on its own weight. Though grisly, it is very effective.§!""
 magic_drain_populace_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gA very enigmatic thing about chi is that it may be moved from one individual to another. When applied to the organs of state, it produces drastic results - bureaucrats complete their dues at great speed, generals innovate at record times, and the admiralty stews at an incomparable rate. By draining the chi of select villages (at a somewhat sustainable rate) and redirecting it into the royal palace, the aristocracy will be capable of shaking off their lethargy with outbursts of energy.§!""
 magic_blood_ritual_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gBlood is the greatest conduit to magic available on this planet. It, more than even Teimarji, contains an incredibly dense amount of magic. Any magical spell can be shored up, or even enabled, by great death - as the blood must be fresh. There have been rumors of spells enabled only by the use of great sacrifices, perhaps it is time to consider one...§!""
 magic_spirit_consumption_desc_tt:0 "---------------------------------\n"§gThere are some spirits that are incredibly knowledgeable. The Khelorvalshi are capable of arranging a ritual such that the [Y01.Monarch.GetTitle] can consume their essence and absorb their knowledge. This might prove successful, should the spirit hold knowledge the user does not. Likewise, if the spirit is strong enough to hold more energy than the effort to consume them, the excess chi can strengthen mental faculties.§!""
