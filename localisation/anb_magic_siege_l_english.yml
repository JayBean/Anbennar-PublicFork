 cast_siege_magic_title:0 "£icon_magic_small£ §SCast Siege Magic§!"
 cast_siege_magic_desc:0 "A province (with a fort) besieged by a leader can be the subject of terrifying siege magics."
 
 magic_siege.goback:0 "Go back"
 magic_siege.fail:0 "Oh well."
 magic_siege.1.t:0 "Siege Magic"
 magic_siege.1.d:0 "Select which magical spell you want [Root.Monarch.GetName] to cast on [spell_target_province.GetName]."
 magic_siege.1.a:0 "I've changed my mind."
 
 magic_siege.2.t:0 "Summon Siege Elemental"
 magic_siege.2.d:0 "Elementals are beings pulled from their respective plane to temporarily serve a master in our world. A large enough elemental could deal heavy damage to enemy fortifications, acting as a vanguard for our besieging troops.\n\n§B(Success chance is influenced by Conjuration Level and Fort Level)§!"
 magic_siege.2.a:0 "Cast Conjure Elemental"
 magic_siege.3.t:0 "Summoning Succeeds"
 magic_siege.3.d:0 "The ritual is complete, and a hulking beast of elemental fury stands above your men - ready to aid the besiegers in the short time it remains under your service."
 magic_siege.3.a:0 "Conjuration is great!"
 magic_siege.4.t:0 "Summoning Failing"
 magic_siege.4.d:0 "The summoning ritual is harder than expected, and will require more power to conjure one to our realm."
 magic_siege.4.a:0 "Spend more power!"
 magic_siege.4.b:0 "Give up."
 
 
 magic_siege.5.t:0 "Dominate to Surrender"
 magic_siege.5.d:0 "The minds of lesser men are susceptible to the whims of powerful, magical minds. A strong enough Enchanter could impose his or her will upon the defenders, forcing them to lay down their arms, open gates or even fight their own men, causing havoc and total submission against a besieged fortification.\n\n§B(Success chance is influenced by the province's Garrison)§!"
 magic_siege.5.a:0 "Cast Domination"
 magic_siege.6.t:0 "Successful Domination"
 magic_siege.6.d:0 "At once, the defenders of [spell_target_province.GetName] open the gates and march in columns towards your besieging army, now prisoners of the state and (for now) your will."
 magic_siege.6.a:0 "Excellent"
 magic_siege.7.t:0 "Failed Domination"
 magic_siege.7.d:0 "Your enchantment does not reach enough minds to hand over a bloodless victory. A few astute defenders are beginning to discover that their fellow soldiers are not acting with a will of their own, and are beginning to gather the suspects - some are even breaking out of their trance!\n\nForcing a man to surrender is one thing, but forcing him to fight against their perceived allies is another, however, this might be the only option to salvage this situation without completely abandoning the enchantment."
 magic_siege.7.a:0 "Force the dominated few to fight!"
 magic_siege.7.b:0 "Break the Enchantment"
 
 magic_siege.8.t:0 "Greater Fireball"
 magic_siege.8.d:0 "Working similarly to a trebuchet, a powerful mage can create a ball of flame the size of a small house to fling across enemy walls and battlements.\n\n§B(Success chance is influenced by Evocation Level and Fort Level)§!"

 magic_siege.9.t:0 "Greater Fireball Hits!"
 magic_siege.9.d:0 "A tremendous fireball floats above [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s head before being flung right into the defender's ranks, exploding in fire and death. Several men can be seen on fire, some even flinging themselves off the walls."
 magic_siege.9.a:0 "Burn!"
 magic_siege.10.t:0 "Greater Fireball Misses!"
 magic_siege.10.d:0 "Controlling such a large amount of elemental energy is hard, and [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s hits directly against the enemy walls, scorching it, but leaving the defenders behind it undisturbed."
 magic_siege.10.a:0 "Damnit!"
 
 magic_siege.11.t:0 "Earthquake"
 magic_siege.11.d:0 "By channeling magical energy to the ground one can imitate natural earthquakes at a localized area to destroy even the strongest fortifications. While excellent with an immediate result, this spell can have long-lasting effects on the province as a whole.\n\n§B(Success chance is increased by Evocation Level and when cast on Mountainous, Hilly or Island provinces)§!"
 magic_siege.11.a:0 "Cast Earthquake"
 magic_siege.12.t:0 "Earthquake Successful"
 magic_siege.12.d:0 "Men on both sides could feel the tremors... and before they knew it the very earth itself shook with the fury of the gods, taking men off their feet and collapsing several buildings and defenses!"
 magic_siege.12.a:0 "Hold your ground, men!"
 magic_siege.13.t:0 "Earthquake Faltering"
 magic_siege.13.d:0 "Whether it be the province terrain being more resistant to earthquakes or just bad luck, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Earthquake spell needs more power in order to sustain it."
 magic_siege.13.a:0 "More power!"
 magic_siege.13.b:0 "Its not worth the effort"
 
 magic_siege.14.t:0 "Meteor Strike"
 magic_siege.14.d:0 "Only the most powerful of Evokers can tame the will of the heavens and bring down a meteor from above into whatever poor targets the mage desires.\n\n§B(Success chance is decreased by Fort Level)§!"
 magic_siege.14.a:0 "Cast Meteor Strike"
 magic_siege.15.t:0 "Meteor Strike Successful"
 magic_siege.15.d:0 "In a single downward sweep [Root.Monarch.GetName] brings [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand down upon the enemy fort, which is quickly followed by a meteor crashing down, flinging debris and bodies everywhere."
 magic_siege.15.a:0 "Heavens come crashing upon you!"
 magic_siege.16.t:0 "Meteor Strike Breaks"
 magic_siege.16.d:0 "It takes a certain will to guide a meteor to its intended target, and [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s aim is not as true at it seems.\n\nBy expending more power [Root.Monarch.GetName] can guide a lesser fragment of the meteor to do lesser damage on the fort, or let go and simply amaze everyone with a celestial show."
 magic_siege.16.a:0 "Guide a lesser fragment"
 magic_siege.16.b:0 "Let go"
 
 magic_siege.17.t:0 "Thunderstorm"
 magic_siege.17.d:0 "By controlling the weather one can conjure a storm cloud and keep it stationary above a large target - a powerful mage can then use it as a catalyst for a Thunderstorm spell, which strikes lightning down from the cloud at the mage's command.\n\n§B(Success chance is increased when cast in Tropical or Mild Winter climates)§!"
 magic_siege.17.a:0 "Cast Thunderstorm"
 magic_siege.18.t:0 "Thunderstorm Succeeds"
 magic_siege.18.d:0 "Dark clouds begin to loom over [spell_target_province.GetName], striking lightning down at the defenders. Soon, lightning strikes are as common and frequent as the beat of a drum."
 magic_siege.18.a:0 "Sorry, I can't hear you!"
 magic_siege.19.t:0 "Thunderstorm Wanders"
 magic_siege.19.d:0 "Taming the weather is a frivolous and heavily concentration-led affair, and this particular thunder cloud is quite hard to tame and keep still."
 magic_siege.19.a:0 "Concentrate on keeping it still"
 magic_siege.19.b:0 "Let it go on its way"
 
 magic_siege.20.t:0 "Shapechange into Giant"
 magic_siege.20.d:0 "Giants were once the hegemons of the old world, and the ones who brought the end to the Rule of Dragons. For a short time the defenders of [spell_target_province.GetName] will learn what it is like to fight against one of such colossal size.\n\n§B(Success chance is decreased by the enemy province owner's Military Technology level)§!"
 magic_siege.20.a:0 "Cast Shapechange"
 magic_siege.21.t:0 "Attack on [spell_target_province.GetName]"
 magic_siege.21.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName], in giant form, marches across the field, ripping and destroying any sort of resistance like a child demolishing a playhouse.\n\nYou have two options: use the element of gigantic surprise to bring swift victory, or retain your giant form and support the besiegers for a longer period of time."
 magic_siege.21.a:0 "Let's finish this!"
 magic_siege.21.b:0 "Support as usual"
 magic_siege.22.t:0 "The Bigger They Are..."
 magic_siege.22.d:0 "You fall to your knees, constantly barraged by whatever your foes could muster. Wounded and battered, your mind begins to lose all hope and life..."
 magic_siege.22.a:0 "...the harder they fall."
 magic_siege.22.b:0 "Thankfully I had a protective ward!"
 
 magic_siege.23.t:0 "Shapechange into Dragon"
 magic_siege.23.d:0 "What's better than a giant? A dragon!\nLong has man dreamt of mastering the skies, and now [Root.Monarch.GetName] can make it a reality.\nTake flight and burn them. Burn them all!\n\n§B(Success chance is decreased by the enemy province owner's Military Technology level)§!"
 magic_siege.23.a:0 "Cast Shapechange"
 magic_siege.24.t:0 "Attack on [spell_target_province.GetName]"
 magic_siege.24.d:0 "Strokes of flame and death dot across [spell_target_province.GetName], as one pass follows the other, the defenders begin to lose all hope fighting against such a beast."
 magic_siege.24.a:0 "Let's finish this!"
 magic_siege.24.b:0 "Continue the Dragonflight"
 magic_siege.25.t:0 "Dragonfall"
 magic_siege.25.d:0 "One moment you're flying, the next you're spiraling down towards the ground. A lucky shot has felled you and you risk falling to your death!\n\nYour head spins. It's hard to keep consciousness. You're going to die."
 magic_siege.25.a:0 "It all comes crashing down"
