 serpentshead_straits_decision_title:0 "Enforce the Frostbridges Toll"
 serpentshead_straits_decision_desc:0 "For as long as can be remembered, the Frostbridges Strait has been taxed by who can control it. However, throughout the years none have attained complete control, with Reachmen sailors in Eyegard contending with Gerudian reavers in Sporreyn for control of the Straits. With a weak control over the straits, powers in the Giant's Grave Sea have gotten away with free access in and out to the greater world. No longer! With our mighty realm controlling the islands and lands at the bottleneck of the Serpentshead, our fleets can tax all the trade entering in and out, and starve our enemies in the Giant's Grave Sea!"

###EVENTS###

 gerudia.29.t:0 "The Taric Exodus"
 gerudia.29.d:0 "Every day, our subjects report more and more wagons stocking up on essentials and belongings, more and more families heading out across the horizon. It seems the Tarics, who have been our neighbours for so long, have set out for greener pastures. This has led to some less complaining from our subjects about their various misgivings towards them, but also less economic activity. Only time will tell what this will mean for the Tarics and the communities they leave behind."
 gerudia.29.a:0 "Whatever."

 gerudia.30.t:0 "The Cagodic Exodus"
 gerudia.30.d:0 "Every day, our subjects report more and more wagons stocking up on essentials and belongings, more and more families heading out across the horizon. It seems the Cagodics, who have been our neighbours for so long, have set out for greener pastures. This has led to some less complaining from our subjects about their various misgivings towards them, but also less economic activity. Only time will tell what this will mean for the Cagodics and the communities they leave behind."
 gerudia.30.a:0 "Very Well."

 gerudia.31.t:0 "Homecoming"
 gerudia.31.d:0 "At dawn, the two parties met upon the western banks of the mighty Vroren which once marked the northern edge of the world, at least for the Cannorians. One group: the soldiers of [Root.Country.GetName], their banners held high and accompanied by their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The other group: a band of men on horseback, at the front a man draped in furs both foreign and familiar to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], a knife on his belt and a flatbow over his shoulder.\n\n“[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we come in hope of righting a great and terrible wrong imposed upon our people. Many years ago, we were forced from our lands by the orcish menace you vanquished.” The man gestured to his people as he continued, “Some of my kin wish for autonomy and the right to rule ourselves, but I humbly accept the rule of your grace. I do not aspire for kingship, I simply want my sons and daughters to know the homeland of our forefathers.”\n\nA moment passes, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] makes [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] choice"
 gerudia.31.a:0 "We have other plans for the land."
 gerudia.31.b:0 "Very well, at least the land will be put to good use."
 gerudia.31.c:0 "A loyal vassal to tame these far-flung lands would not hurt…"
 gerudia.31.1:0 "I wonder what they will accomplish there…"

 gerudia.32.t:0 "Tarics No More"
 gerudia.32.d:0 "It started slowly, as most things do. Words and phrases, foods, various baubles and trinkets from the communities they stayed with. But over the years, the foreign influence on the Tarics increased. Marriages between the Tarics and others resulted in children of two worlds, and some chose to stay behind in the villages, towns, and cities that had captured their heart. As for the remaining nomads: clothing, art, music; every stop kept changing them little by little.\n\nEventually, they stopped speaking of their homeland with sadness and reverence, and instead more of nostalgia and wonder, like the elves and their once-lost Aelantir. And now, so many years after they came, the Tarics have ceased to be more than one of our own with a curious origin story."
 gerudia.32.a:0 "Sad, perhaps, but just the way of things."

 gerudia.33.t:0 "An Oath Fulfilled"
 gerudia.33.d:0 "At dawn, the two parties met upon the western banks of the mighty Vroren which once marked the northern edge of the world, at least for the Cannorians. One group: the soldiers of [Root.Country.GetName], their banners held high and led by their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The other group: men and women who despite wearing furs and leather like common Tarics, carry the measure of their supposed Castanorian forebears.\n\n“[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], we come in the name of an ancient oath we made with the Empire of Castanor, to forever guard the North from the monsters that lurk beyond Cannor. With your victories against the orcs which threw us back from our home, we humbly ask that we be allowed to return to our lands, so that we may defend the Pass once more.”\n\nA moment passes, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] makes [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] choice."
 gerudia.33.a:0 "We have other plans for the land."
 gerudia.33.b:0 "Very well, at least the land will be put to good use."
 gerudia.33.c:0 "A loyal vassal to tame these far-flung lands would not hurt…"
 gerudia.33.1:0 "I wonder what they will accomplish there…"

 gerudia.34.t:0 "An Oath Abandoned"
 gerudia.34.d:0 "It started slowly, as most things do. Words and phrases, foods, various baubles and trinkets from the communities they stayed with. But over the years, the foreign influence on the Cagodics increased. Marriages between the Cagodics and others resulted in children of two worlds, and some of them chose to stay behind in the villages, towns, and cities that had captured their heart. As for the remaining nomads: clothing, art, music; every stop changing them, little by little.\n\nEventually, they stopped speaking of their ancient oath with Castanor the same way, with duty and a longing for a chance to fulfil it once more. To them, it was just something their ancestors believed in. And now, so many years after they came, the Cagodics have ceased to be more than one of our own with a curious origin story."
