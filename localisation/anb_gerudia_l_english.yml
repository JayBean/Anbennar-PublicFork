 serpentshead_straits_decision_title:0 "Enforce the Frostbridges Toll"
 serpentshead_straits_decision_desc:0 "For as long as can be remembered, the Frostbridges Strait has been taxed by who can control it. However, throughout the years none have attained complete control, with Reachmen sailors in Eyegard contending with Gerudian reavers in Sporreyn for control of the Straits. With a weak control over the straits, powers in the Giant's Grave Sea have gotten away with free access in and out to the greater world. No longer! With our mighty realm controlling the islands and lands at the bottleneck of the Serpentshead, our fleets can tax all the trade entering in and out, and starve our enemies in the Giant's Grave Sea!"
