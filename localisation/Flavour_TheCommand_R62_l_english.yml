 R62_the_marching_of_boots_title: "The Marching of Boots"
 R62_the_marching_of_boots_desc: "Verdant farmland. Grasping jungle. Mist-draped hills. We march over each, and take them all for own. None shall make us falter, none shall see us cease, and soon all Haless will known the rhythm of our boots."

 R62_the_beating_of_drums_title: "The Beating of Drums"
 R62_the_beating_of_drums_desc: "Ferocious battle. Bitter siege. The long, long, march of a legion out of [Root.Capital.GetName]. The drums sound for each, reverberating through shield and spear and spine, and all who hear it know they shall soon live according to our beat."

 R62_the_howling_of_horns_title: "The Howling of Horns"
 R62_the_howling_of_horns_desc: "Fervent battlecry. Whispered defiance. Cannon thunder. Each and everyone is drowned out in the blare of our signal-horns and triumph-horns, just as Haless is drowned in our rule."

 R62_serpentsbloom_rations_title: "Serpentbloom Rations"
 R62_serpentsbloom_rations_desc: "Deep in the hobgoblin ancestral memory are the days when we were forced to the Serpentspine's fringes, when we starved and died in the dark. When we took the Jade Mines from the dwarves, that changed -- the bioluminescent fungus known as Serpentbloom, abundant in cavern and road, provides all the nutrition a growing hobgoblin could require. \n\nTended to and prepared by slaves, it serves as our soldiers' primary means of supply. But as our military grows, so too must the Serpentbloom farms. The slaves will work, the crops will grow, and so the armies will march."

 command_serpentsbloom_tt: "Every owned province with Serpentbloom will gain the following modifier:"

 R62_control_the_zanyu_kinunin_title: "Control the Zanyu Kinunin"
 R62_control_the_zanyu_kinunin_desc: "The orcs are simpleminded, yet a resilient, rowdy and stubborn race, making them effective slaves, yet, hard to control. Though these challenges are difficult, through a process of token reward, large amounts of movement, and enough discipline, even the toughest of orcs can be made to bend the knee.\n\nWith these new practices, no orc shall ever see freedom, it is their duty as a race to serve, and to obey The Command, for even the dumbest orc knows they are nothing without their master."

 R62_blades_and_spades_title: "Blades and Spades"
 R62_blades_and_spades_desc: "The orcs are fearsome warriors, as shown by large amounts of strength and an almost indomitable will. These traits, though applied well in the field of battle, are also able to be applied very effectively in our farms.\n\nWith our dispersal of the orcish race across Rahen, we’ve seen a large amount of increased output of crops among our farms with orc slaves. The effectiveness of these orcish yields across our land has been astonishing, and with this, we shall now continue this trend of orcish farmers and labourers in our domain.\n\nLet the orc not just toil in the field of battle, but also in the field of grain and rice."

 R62_tempered_rage_title: "Tempered Rage"
 R62_tempered_rage_desc: "Through our widespread practices of orcish slavery and disperal of their race across Rahen, a new kind of race, one from the intermingling of humans and orcs, has popped up. Due to them possessing orc blood, they are still fairly disorganized and easy for us to subdue. But, because they are still smarter than the average orc, they are perfect for more complex but menial production and administrative tasks. We shall continue observing the half-orcs, for they have been quite the asset."

 R62_honourable_half_orcs_title: "Honourable Half Orcs"
 R62_honourable_half_orcs_desc: "With the increasing numbers of half-orcs across our lands, especially in our Ninun enforced areas, they’ve seen a new identity, instead of being seen as bastards and outcasts, they are now seen as hard working craftsmen, dedicated to a sense of honour. With this new reputation, the half-orcs have now gained a much more honourable place among the human Wuhyun societies. With this new reputation, many more half-orcs have popped up across our domain, and even half-orc majorities in a few places have been seen. We should continue to encourage this reputation across our domain, for an honourable craftsman is a loyal craftsman."

 R62_new_schools_of_thought_title: "New Schools of Thought"
 R62_new_schools_of_thought_desc: "Our campaign in debate hall is as successful as any other, and we have convinced many of the High Philosophies’ followers that our ideology is the way of the future. But the process has not been a war, in truth. Some of their schools of thought are so similar to the ideas of Godlost that we agree with them more than debate.\n\nThese schools all have their original places of conception, where the finest of their philosophers gather. If we were to occupy these lands, we could discuss ideas with Rahen’s best, and through that perhaps even sharpen our own understanding of duty and honour."

 R62_teach_and_learn_title: "Teach and Learn"
 R62_teach_and_learn_desc: "There is much to teach the people of Haless, and few places to do it. Simply building more schools will help this problem, but we must ensure that what is taught there does not conflict with our values. Once we have a large enough network, we can establish a curriculum for the schools to follow."

 R62_philosophy_of_state_and_blood_title: "Philosophy of State and Blood"
 R62_philosophy_of_state_and_blood_desc: ""There are only two groups in this world: us, and them. Everyone who works as a part of our state is us - they are members of our one united family and will be afforded the respect that such membership entails. Race, creed, and history are no barrier to joining the family that is the state - only one's efforts matter. Those who oppose the state, however, are them. They have chosen to reject the family, and they will stop at nothing to see us destroyed. It is only our combined strength and faith in one another that will see us outlast them. In the end there can be no peace between us and them - only blood."\n\n-Gottami of the Elephant Herd, one of the most fervent and prominent advocates behind the rise of Nationalist teachings in the early 16th century."

 R62_a_good_marshal_title: "A Good Marshal"
 R62_a_good_marshal_desc: "All great families are built upon trust. So too then, must the Great Command. While our push for a stronger national identity has been successful, we still hold to the idea that a marshal must prove their strength to lead our great nation.\n\nThis shall be the case no longer. If we are to trust one another, we must also trust our leader. Respect shall be a given; any marshal is a good marshal, until proven otherwise."

 R62_virtues_embodied_title: "Virtues Embodied"
 R62_virtues_embodied_desc: "Many [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s have led the Great Command. Most have lead us to victory, some few exalting in a succession of glorious campaigns.\n\nBut none have rivalled [Root.Monarch.GetName]. He is honour, he is discipline, he is strategic brilliance and martial acuity. And as he studies the War Room's maps, sketching out the next campaign and all that comes after, you can see the face of Haless -- the future of Haless -- reshaped within his eyes."

 R62_secure_logistics_title: "Secure Logistics"
 R62_secure_logistics_desc: "The Wolf, the great beast after which one of our commands is named, stands for many of our nation's greatest virtues, one of them being the well-trained wargs and secure paths that supply our troops throughout Rahen.\n\nIt is their job, their honour, their responsibility to keep our command running, in both the literal and implied meaning. A robust network of roads, in the style of the once-great golden highway, with way-stations and patrol houses will give our messengers the ability to fulfill this task in accordance with expectations."

 R62_supply_the_kikunin_title: "Supply the Kikunin"
 R62_supply_the_kikunin_desc: "Kikun - our Army, the beating drums and hearts of our nation. Our world and pride revolve around the soldiers that put their lives at risk to further push into Rahen. As they stray further and further away from their homes they need to be supplied with all they need, food being the foremost of all. As is often said, an army marches on its stomach."

 R62_calm_down_sir_title: "Calm Down Sir"
 R62_calm_down_sir_desc: ""This revolt in Sir marks the first major instance of the conquered rebelling. Our response here is a message to every place and people in Haless. It should be a clear one."\n\n-The Wolf Martial, report to the War Room, two days after the uprising in Sir."

 R62_disarming_the_conquered_title: "Disarming the Conquered"
 R62_disarming_the_conquered_desc: "Spears, swords, and guns are needed in many places in the Great Command. They must stream from our workshops, they must be available for training, they must be abundant on the frontlines. But where they cannot be is in the hands of the conquered."

 R62_strange_yet_familiar_title: "Strange Yet Familiar"
 R62_strange_yet_familiar_desc: "We expected resistance as we imposed our philosophies in conquered lands, for even with a war done there are battles to fight. But in Kamapar we have found the opposite: the locals’ personal philosophies seem to blend well with Godlost ways and already they are debating and discussing its finer points -- a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."

 R62_an_exaltation_of_man_title: "An Exaltation of Man"
 R62_an_exaltation_of_man_desc: ""Honour. Discipline. Loyalty. These are what make a hobgoblin. These are what make up The Great Command.\n\n"Among the conquered there are those with honour. Those with discipline. Those with loyalty. They are a spear to be sharpened, a blade to be honed. They will serve, and will serve us well."\n-[Root.Monarch.GetName], ending the War Room’s lengthy debate over whether humans have a place in the army."

 R62_permit_debate_title: "Permission of Debate"
 R62_permit_debate_desc: "The humans of Haless have demonstrated two things we did not expect: the capacity to possess honour, and the ability to think like us as well. Perhaps it would be prudent to promote discussion with the humans by constructing buildings of learning.\n\nProgress has never been achieved by ignorance; it is possible we may learn something from their "High Philosophy"."

 R62_children_of_the_azepyanunin_title: "Children of the Azepyanunin"
 R62_children_of_the_azepyanunin_desc: "‘A spear in reserve\nA sword, held high, not fallen\nIn the breeze, Wuhyun’\n\n-The Breeze, 1601, one of the many poems that emerged from the Azepyanunin’s unique style."

 R62_adoptive_clans_title: "Adoptive Clans"
 R62_adoptive_clans_desc: "With pressures mounting from within and without, the burden upon the clans grows too great to bear. We must take action, and soon, for the good of this newfound empire, built upon the back of unity. To threaten such a notion would be catastrophic, but to lose all that we have built would be far worse.\n\nBut all is well, for hobgoblins understand the notion of family far better than other races, with family presiding over all else -- even one’s own nation. For those unfortunate many whose families have been pruned by war, let us encourage the adoption and merging of tattered families into new, adoptive clans."

 R62_the_ten_reforms_title: "The Ten Reforms"
 R62_the_ten_reforms_desc: "As the Empire grows, so too does the stress upon our social systems. No longer are we a people huddled tightly in the caverns of the Jade Mines. Thousands of feet march to the beat of booming drums, rhythmic gunfire, and the melodic clangor of steel and yet the homesteads to which each soldier longs to return are in peril. Necessity breeds action, and despite our reservations, the time has come to codify the law under one central authority so that no individual may shirk their responsibility.\n\nThe Ten Reforms shall be engraved in stone so that they may stand eternal, just as we stand resolute in the face of an enemy bearing down upon us. They shall detail the social, legal, and administrative codes that all must follow for the edification of each individual, and the permanence of the Great Command as a whole."

# R62_the_marshals_dilemma_title: "The Marshals Dilemma"
# R62_the_marshals_dilemma_desc: ""

 R62_strengthen_the_ninyu_kikun_title: "Strengthen the Ninyu Kikun"
 R62_strengthen_the_ninyu_kikun_desc: "There was an idea. To bring together a group of remarkable soldiers from Boar, Wolf, and Lion. To see if they could become -- something more. So when the Great Command needed them, they could fight the battles that an individual kikun never could.\n\nThe Ninyu Kikun have served, and served well. It is time to expand and strengthen their forces: from a small group of the Grand Marshal's elite, into a proper combined army, able to bring together the strengths of all the tribes into one cohesive force."

 R62_the_war_room_title: "The War Room"
 R62_the_war_room_desc: "The Great Command is a federation of the three clans: Boar, Wolf, and Lion. Across our nation, there are hundreds of fortifications, a dozen major hobgoblin cities, three great warcamps. But there is only one War Room.\n\nHere, the Marshals who rule each Command debate strategy and tactics. Here, the Grand Marshal sends the orders initiating the next campaign. And here, we remake the future of Haless."

 R62_the_support_of_the_marshals_title: "The Support of the Marshals"
 R62_the_support_of_the_marshals_desc: "Three marshals, three Commands. This trinity has guided us from the Jade Mines into Rahen, and will lead us even further beyond.\n\nWithout them the Grand Marshal is powerless. But with their support, we can achieve feats that will rival even the conquest of Jaher."

 R62_build_new_households_title: "Build New Households"
 R62_build_new_households_desc: "As we prepare for departure from the dark depths of the Serpentspine into our newly conquered land in Rahen, we must build houses -- houses to live in, to train in, to work in, houses, that will be home to generations of hobgoblins, where grandfathers will teach the young in our ancestral ways."

 R62_moving_camp_title: "Moving Camp"
 R62_moving_camp_desc: "The time is nigh, the day has come: We have prepared supplies, farms, homes. We have garnered the support of the marshals. Now it is time for us to finally leave the Serpentspine behind. It is time to move camp!"

 R62_digging_in_title: "Digging In"
 R62_digging_in_desc: "In truth, no matter how brutal or bloody the campaign, conquest only marks the beginning of the war that must be waged to rule a territory. What remains is the long haul of eliminating rebels, responding to unrest, and pacifying the land. The anchors of such warfare are well-constructed and well-readied forts, a base for responding to any disturbances, and just as we ensure our armies are well-equipped we must ensure our forts are well-manned."

 R62_a_changing_diet_title: "A Changing Diet"
 R62_a_changing_diet_desc: "Long long ago, we were forced to the surface, scrabbling out a life from hunting and gathering. But in the centuries after we won our way back to dominate the Jade Mines, our warriors have lived and died on a diet of serpentbloom, fungus, and other such subterranean foods.\n\nBut now that is changing. Our surface farms recover from war, and yield vast amounts of wheat, rice, and legumes of all kinds -- as such our rations are evolving, and we are evolving with them."

 R62_life_under_the_sun_title: "Life Under the Sun"
 R62_life_under_the_sun_desc: ""Ah, Wolf Marshal, a hunt after these logistics are done?"\n"Perhaps another time, Standardbearer, I have commitments in the afternoon."\n\n"Oh! A long day in the war room? Consulting the latest maps of the front? An inspection of troops?"\n\n"No. You see, I promised my son I would teach him how to worg-ride…"\n\n-Overheard at the strategic tents in the Great Warcamp of [Root.Capital.GetName]"

 R62_the_wuhyun_title: "The Wuhyun"
 R62_the_wuhyun_desc: ""To be Wuhyun is to be a man of honour, but what is honour? I answer you, honour is this: do not lie, do not be insincere, do not be obsequious, do not be superficial, do not be greedy, do not be rude, do not be boastful, do not be arrogant, do not slander, do not be unfaithful, be on good terms with comrades, do not be overly concerned with events, show concern for one another, be compassionate, with a strong sense of duty.\n\n"To be Wuhyun is more than merely the swiftness of one’s blade or a willingness to lay down one's life."\n-Chandra Malhotra, On Honour"

 R62_laws_of_ninun_title: "Laws of Ninun"
 R62_laws_of_ninun_desc: "Where there were petty warlords, now there is the Great Command. Where there was unrest, there is order. And where there were countless people aiming for little and achieving less, there will be the laws of Ninun: the education that makes a man, the examinations that proves their martial and cultural suitability, the rules that allow them to live as part of the Great Command."

 R62_warriors_of_the_kintonan_title: "Warriors of the Kintonan"
 R62_warriors_of_the_kintonan_desc: ""If you do not have spies, you can never know what is substantial or insubstantial concerning your enemy’s intention, you cannot succeed in invading a massive wall of numerous miles, or lead an entire enemy army into a trap and achieve a victory in every battle that you encounter.\n\n"Is there anything else which enables a single person to ruin a force of countless people? Only the way of a ninja."\n\n-Fujibayashi Ken, a Kintonan scholar, in his introduction to a work describing the unique practices of some Kintonan soldiers."

 R62_wuhyun_kikun_title: "Wuhyun Kikun"
 R62_wuhyun_kikun_desc: ""You have served with honour. You have served with discipline. You have served with talent and skill. It has not gone unrecognized: For the first time in generations, the War Room has approved a new class of Kikun. Tomorrow, recruitment begins for the first Wuhyun Kikun."\n\n-The Grand Marshal, speaking before assembled Wuhyun soldiers."

 R62_the_burden_of_empire_title: "The Burden of Empire"
 R62_the_burden_of_empire_desc: "Humble roots cannot hope to anchor a tree of stone, not one such as this. The drums of war beat ever on, a rhythmic symphony of blood strewn upon the fields below. Bands of our warriors race ‘cross the face of Rahen, the three Commands an iron will behind them.\n\nNever have our people been such a sight to behold, yet with that glory comes a great price. These shoulders grow weary, and only the tribes may lift the weight off of them. But can the three Commands truly manage such a feat?"

 R62_the_act_of_division_title: "The Act of Division"
 R62_the_act_of_division_desc: "For decades the tribes have fallen into place, naturally filling roles to create a grand organic tapestry. It is beautiful in its efficiency and structure. Hobgoblins possess a great unity of purpose, allowing us to reach above our station in the name of progress. This arrangement has brought [Root.GetName] to prosperity, but this progress is based on a delicate balance. Should the unity of the tribes grow stressed beyond limit, only naught but utter disaster could follow. The time has come to formally divide the rights of administration and purpose between the Commands, transitioning this great nation to one of modern governance."

 R62_the_tiger_command_title: "The Tiger Command"
 R62_the_tiger_command_desc: "When we first reached into the outside light to take our rightful place in Rahen and beyond, we encountered the wise Harimari and their human subjects, however, it quickly became clear that the great wisdom of the Harimari had also made them complacent, decadent and arrogant. If we are to rule without falling into decline like the Harimraj has, then we should not just copy their teachings and ways of administration, but also make sure to learn from the mistakes they made. This shall be the task of our newest administrative division -- the Tiger Command.\n\nBy focusing on the administration and education of both our own kind and our human subjects, the Tiger Command will make sure we do not falter in our march, and that every single citizen is instilled with the values of discipline and order. They shall bring us the worthy administrators and commanders our nation needs, so that our campaigns never fail."

 R62_shackled_claws_title: "Shackled Claws"
 R62_shackled_claws_desc: "Many centuries ago, Harimar led his people out of the jungles of southern Rahen. Under his leadership the tiger people conquered the whole of Haless. They swept all before them with the might of tooth and claw. However the harimari softened over time. Their lives of luxury and power lost them their edge, and their empire fractured. It is the weakened harimari that the Tiger Command base their administration on. But perhaps if they learn aggression and ambition from the harimari of old they could pose a threat to us. We cannot let that come to pass. They shall remain administrators and be happy in their task."

 R62_one_great_command_title: "One Great Command"
 R62_one_great_command_desc: "When the master forges a blade, he takes the unrefined ore and consolidates it through hammer blows. Then he divides his metal into strong steel and soft iron. Through folding and heating he expels any impurities from the bar, strengthening its bond. Then to make the blade he wraps the steel around the iron, with steel forming the edge of the blade and iron forming the spine. This makes a complete whole and results in a sword unlike any other.\n\nAnd so has the Command forged itself into a complete whole. We have been hammered, folded, refolded, recombined, heated and quenched. Our reforms, our wars and our internal struggle have made us stronger. It is time we show that to the world, we aren’t just six disparate Commands united in alliance. We are One Great Command!"

 R62_the_edict_of_x_title: "The Edict of [GetYear]"
 R62_the_edict_of_x_desc: "In 1428 Haless was a land of chaos and strife. It was a land that was weak and exposed, with kings and peasants squabbling amongst themselves. Now that has all changed. We have reshaped the world, forged a single people out of the many feuding tribes and kingdoms. A new language has arisen! Social values are one and the same from Tianlou to Sramaya. Humanity has prospered under our rule and guidance, and we have learned from them in turn. We now march side by side, hobgoblin, human, harimari and half-orc. Our boots beat to the same drums. One people. One Command.\n\nBut now, in [GetYear], we have come to learn much of the world beyond the mountains and seas. And just like Haless of 1444 it is a place of chaos and strife. It is time that we sign our fate. Haless isn’t enough, we must unite the world."

 R62_cursed_temples_title: "Cursed Temples"
 R62_cursed_temples_desc: "In our campaigns, we have conquered lush farmland, bustling city, imposing fortress. But the High Temples which dot the land are unlike anything else, and following our conquest our administrators report strange happenings in their vicinity. Perhaps the Oni, with all their knowledge, may have an idea of what is happening here -- and if so, our continued security demands their prompt assistance."

 R62_prepare_new_stewards_title: "Prepare New Stewards"
 R62_prepare_new_stewards_desc: "Once we leave the Jade Mines behind us we need someone else to govern it for us. But whoever this might be, they need to know all about our ancestral homes, the tunnels and caverns that have sheltered us for ages upon ages.\n\nIt is time to find promising candidates and prepare them to become our Stewards."

 R62_warbringer_peacemaker_title: "Warbringer Peacemaker"
 R62_warbringer_peacemaker_desc: "With the tensions between our goblin slave states abating, it is time to formally and properly end their rivalry and prepare them for the future: A future where they will govern the Jade Mines. Let us bind them together through marriage."

 R62_the_jade_march_title: "The Jade March"
 R62_the_jade_march_desc: "With the Jade Mines emptying, we leave behind a lot of land, it is time for Blackstep and Stolen Gem to move in. But in order to properly govern it, we must unite them into one country, a march that will administer the Jade Mines in our name: The Jade March."

 R62_deep_mithril_mining_title: "Deep Mithril Mining"
 R62_deep_mithril_mining_desc: "Mithril, though known to us for centuries, has always been difficult to amass due to its rarity, often available to only the strongest (and richest) of Marshals. However, in the newly consolidated Jademarch, the goblins -- natural diggers -- have presented an opportunity to us.\n\nWith enough resources, the goblins could do a deep dig for mithril veins, hopefully sufficient to secure vast quantities -- or at least, enough to ensure our best troops wield mithril weapons, making our forces even more devastating and our advance even more unstoppable."

 R62_the_mithril_forge_title: "The Mithril Forge"
 R62_the_mithril_forge_desc: "With the goblins continuing their mithril mining operations, we have now secured not only a steady, but a plentiful supply of mithril. Beyond our existing foundries in Sarilavhan, we have the possibility to make a new forge, one entirely dedicated to making mithril armaments.\n\nThough the amount of mithril needed to supply this forge would be ludicrous, with enough resources, and goblins, anything should be possible."

 R62_misty_drills_title: "Misty Drills"
 R62_misty_drills_desc: "The martial temples of the Xia spent centuries developing their techniques. They fell to us in a handful of years. Let us repurpose the hundreds of mist-shrouded temples left in our wake to not teach failed philosophies, but to teach the ways of The Great Command."

 R62_the_nature_of_chi_title: "The Nature of Chi"
 R62_the_nature_of_chi_desc: "We lost more than one band of Nosunin to mysterious forces before we understood we were faced with something new: chi. Our generals treated the Xia’s warriors as if they were magic users, and yet… It isn’t quite the same sort of magic that shamans and others have used, either. It’s a peculiar sort of power, but it is also one that we must make a decision on, and sooner, rather than later."

 R62_guards_of_the_ikaniwagain_title: "Guards of the Ikaniwagain"
 R62_guards_of_the_ikaniwagain_desc: ""The Ashigaru are cheaply equipped. Armour of metal plates sewn on a cloth backing, easy to produce and to transport. A sword, a spear, sturdy enough. A conical helm completes their apparel. And a long matchlock gun, combined with constant training and a discipline to rival our own, makes them deadly on the battlefield."\n\n-Grand Marshal of the Dragon Command, reporting on the Ikaniwagain ‘Ashigaru’ to the War Room."

 R62_spread_garrisons_title: "Spread Garrisons"
 R62_spread_garrisons_desc: "An empire remains a facade in the absence of its people. Though great in number, the hobgoblins are absent from the majority of our land, with humans and harimari representing the majorities in newly acquired territory.\n\nOnly those of true hobgoblin blood may be trusted with the defense of the empire against growing odds, and it is the duty of the Commands to send forth a vanguard of veterans with the promise of new lands to settle and defend. "

 R62_the_great_warcamps_title: "The Great Warcamps"
 R62_the_great_warcamps_desc: "Administering an empire requires more than simple magistrates and bureaucrats. Land won by force must be kept by force, a lesson we learned all too well in Sir. To prevent such an event from occurring yet again, a constant military presence must be maintained, both for the purpose of governance and conquest.\n\nGreat warcamps shall be established across the fields of Haless to truly cement our presence as rulers rather than occupiers, and to facilitate renewed campaigns east."

 R62_the_elephant_command_title: "The Elephant Command"
 R62_the_elephant_command_desc: "Beyond the caves and beneath the skies are countless animals, beasts, and monstrosities the likes of which are new to our people. Perhaps seated above them all in terms of raw power, however, is the elephant. A lumbering majesty capable of handling burdens far greater than mere oxen can bear, elephants are the missing piece of the logistical puzzle we found ourselves struggling to solve amidst the unceasing campaigns. We shall shoulder this notion and found the newest division in the command structure -- The Elephant Command.\n\nSeparate from the established triarchy, the Elephant Command’s duty revolves around the construction, fortification, and the transportation of raw materials for processing or for use by the Sunyanin. The very walls that stand between savagery and civilization will be the product of the elephants, and the foundries of the Command will be staffed by the greatest minds they have to offer. In time, the Elephant Command shall become the bulwark that anchors these great lands to the plains of Haless."

 R62_tiger_schools_title: "Tiger Schools"
 R62_tiger_schools_desc: "The Tiger Command’s first and foremost goal has always been to make sure our state is as efficiently administered as it can be. To achieve this goal, we must bring forth generations of well educated humans and hobgoblins. The opening of grand schools and academies is thus vital for this purpose, as even [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] once had to study the basics after all."

 R62_blunted_tusks_title: "Blunted Tusks"
 R62_blunted_tusks_desc: "The elephant lords of Rahen have a method of execution whereby the condemned is nailed by their hands and feet to a flat stretch of ground, after which the presiding lord drives his elephants across them to trample them to death. While this method of execution isn’t commonly practised in South Haless, it must undoubtedly be what the Elephant Command would do to us should they prove themselves our betters. We must ensure this never happens. We will at the same time neuter their strength and ensure their willing cooperation."

 R62_loyalty_enforced_title: "Loyalty Enforced"
 R62_loyalty_enforced_desc: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a strong state in possession of a large territory must be in want of an army. The purpose of this army is to project power, both without and within its borders. It keeps subjects loyal and may serve the state well in times of civil strife. While parts of this army may break off and revolt, the state needs more force to resist such indignities. This force is derived from loyalty and stability. And thus follows the cycle of the state: Force ensures loyalty and stability, and they, in turn, ensure force."\n-Hado Naomichi Tigerborn, On Statecraft, 1622"

 R62_korashi_imports_title: "Korashi Imports"
 R62_korashi_imports_desc: "For centuries, we hobgoblins have struggled to control the shamans that live among us, self-serving creatures commonly known as "mages" by other countries. The strategy that we’ve employed until just recently has been to mutilate or just simply execute shamans, ridding ourselves of their chaotic influence but also eliminating any possibility of using their power for ourselves.\n\nHowever, the Oni of Azjakuma have lately been supplying us with what they call "korashi", a rare material with the ability to neutralize magic’s effects. Using chains of this korashi, we have been able to bind shamans and inhibit their powers, only allowing them to use their magic in the capacity of living weapons during battle. Unfortunately, as the Command expands, the amount of shamans within our territory increases rapidly, while the amount of korashi we control… does not. Thankfully, the Oni are willing to increase exports of korashi to us in exchange for protection. Such an arrangement should be formalized quickly, before there are more shamans in the Command than there is korashi."

 R62_a_question_of_allegiance_title: "A Question of Allegiance"
 R62_a_question_of_allegiance_desc: "The Oni of Azjakuma have been fine allies thus far, a secure flank and useful supports as we push into Haless. However... The Command does not truly have allies. It has enemies, and it has subordinates. We can gradually browbeat Azjakuma with our envoys, or crush them swiftly and firmly beneath our heel. Whichever we choose, the outcome shall be the same: the Oni must become our slaves."

 R62_extract_oni_secrets_desc: ""The Oni have been made to serve. But a sword you do not control is one that can be turned against you. Our campaign is not done until their Korashi secrets are revealed."\n\n-Report of the Wolf Marshal at the War Council"
 
 R62_the_korashi_process_title: "The Korashi Process"
 R62_the_korashi_process_desc: "As the Command has grown, more and more shamans live under our rule. To control them more and more korashi links have had to be forged. Extensive surveying of the Demon Hills has proved that there is just not enough untreated korashi in the Demon Hills for the amount of shamans needing chains. The Oni report to us that a ginormous deposit of Teimarji, their term for raw korashi, exists to the south, between the lands of Yanshen and the One Xia. It is imperative that this area is brought under our control, and that we construct korashi forges so that we can increase production. The supply of Korashi will never be a problem again. But before that all we need to master is the process of creating the substance."

 R62_end_raheni_magic_title: "End Raheni Magic"
 R62_end_raheni_magic_desc: "For far too long, shamans and other magic users have run amok across Rahen, selfishly and indiscriminately using their uncontrollable powers for petty personal gain and sadistic self-satisfaction.\n\nThe Command now has enough korashi chains to bind every shaman in Rahen that doesn’t have battlefield use.. Let this be done, and let us end Raheni magic once and for all."

 R62_centralized_exploitation_title: "Centralized Exploitation"
 R62_centralized_exploitation_desc: "Our constant campaigns means the demand for weapons and armour has never been higher, and as such, our need for more efficient production has increased tremendously. We cannot suffice with what the conquered built, we must build new smithies and foundries across our domain, and centralize their production process such that every one is attuned to the War Room's latest needs."

 R62_the_sarilavhan_foundries_title: "The Sarilavhan Foundries"
 R62_the_sarilavhan_foundries_desc: "Sarilavhan, though serving as the capital of the Command, also serves another very important purpose: Iron working. Though smithies rise across our land, Sarilavhan has grown faster than anywhere else, our capital benefiting from proximity to the rich iron mines of Kradhungur and the Serpentspine.\n\nWith this massively increased production, Sarilavhan has now become the home of some of the largest foundries in not just the Great Command, but in all of Rahen."

 R62_the_evolution_of_warfare_title: "The Evolution of Warfare"
 R62_the_evolution_of_warfare_desc: "Though tradition may dominate the minds of our people, pragmatism must take precedence on the field of battle. We have watched the rapid development of gunpowder weaponry with great interest, though up until now, bulky cannons simply acted as a poor substitute for a bound mage. But one cannot dwell on the past without risking the future. Guns shall roar, walls shall crumble, and the Great Command shall oversee it all, for such is the will of the Marshal."

 R62_expand_the_sunyanin_title: "Expand the Sunyanin"
 R62_expand_the_sunyanin_desc: "Among the many support roles undertaken by female hobgoblins is that of the Sunyanin: the Command’s dedicated engineer corps. Instrumental in both conventional and siege warfare, the Sunyanin dig trenches, tunnel underneath enemy fortresses, and ultimately bring about the downfall of [Root.GetName]’s many enemies. In this sense, the Sunyanin plays an integral part in all military campaigns, and as such must constitute the best of the female officer corps."

 R62_the_dragon_command_title: "The Dragon Command"
 R62_the_dragon_command_desc: "The two great rivers of Haless are the Kharunyana and the Yanhe. Both spring from our lands and so it is only natural that we lay claim to their entire course. It is the latter of these rivers that flows eastwards into Yanshen, where it gives life to the entire region. The locals say that the spirit of the river is in fact the most powerful of creatures: A dragon. And thus, as we claim their river, their lifeblood, it is only fitting that we also claim their great protector. A new division, a new command, shall be created especially for them -- the Dragon Command.\n\nThe eunuchs of Yanshen are a crafty people. Their schools and universities have gone beyond the mundane pursuits of administration and philosophy, and ventured into the realm of natural science. The Dragon Command’s keenest thinkers will extract their secrets and transform them into marvels of engineering. They will equip the war machine of the Command with the most advanced machines of war."

 R62_standardized_sunyanin_title: "Standardized Sunyanin"
 R62_standardized_sunyanin_desc: "Until now, each Sunyanin corps has adapted to meet the requirements and style of the army it is attached to. But with the inventions and developments the Dragon Command is overseeing, it is clear we must ensure each and every force is capable of using them. We must standardize the Sunyanin's training and practices at once."

 R62_korashi_tuners_title: "Korashi Tuners"
 R62_korashi_tuners_desc: "Now that the Dragon Command has been created to administer and oversee the Yanshen region, the Great Command can more effectively control the production and processing of korashi present in the area, allowing them to continue to keep pace with the growing number of shamans in our territory.\n\nIndeed, some intrepid artificers within the Dragon Command have begun experimenting with excess korashi, and have tuned the binding chains to allow for more precise and incremental control over the powerful magics held by the shamans."

 R62_muzzled_breath_title: "Muzzled Breath"
 R62_muzzled_breath_desc: "There is a story that the elders tell young hobgoblins to warn them of magic. It tells about two young warriors whose rivalry drives them to greatness and destruction. Both repeatedly best the other in tests of skill, until one day Takemoto, the weaker and cleverer of the two, makes a pact with powers he does not comprehend. He defeats and kills his rival, but when he tries to use his newfound power in war he kills not just the enemy but also his comrades. The Dragon Command’s ambition is admirable, but we cannot let them be like Takemoto. Their advancement will be checked, that they don’t destroy the entire Command."

 R62_prepare_the_troops_title: "Prepare the Troops"
 R62_prepare_the_troops_desc: "The scouts return to us with a clear picture of the terrain: rolling hills and verdant plains, perfect for marching through, with even seasons and familiar edible crops grown by the local populaces easily raided and used to feed our men.\n\nThe land at once appears simple and perhaps even serene, but it would be mistaken to assume the people are similarly so. Dedicated training halls for warriors of varying backgrounds and strategies populate the towns and cities, and every village is guarded by some militarized force. Knowledge on these fighting techniques is fragmented and sourced mostly from northern infiltrations, but there no doubt could be an endless amount of these strategies capable of catching our troops off-guard from villages uncountable.\n\nWith present knowledge, we estimate that these Xia states can field around two to three Kikun, a force as numerous as our own. A challenge for sure, and a worthy one for our new commander."

 R62_the_battle_of_shanyutian_title: "The Battle of Shanyutian"
 R62_the_battle_of_shanyutian_desc: "This is a post-battle report detailing the specifics of our victorious Xianje campaign, written approximately two months since our triumph at Shanyutian. Information presented is based on first-hand accounts of commanders and surviving frontline soldiers.\n\nThe Xia forces crashed upon our frontlines, pursuing combat with our troops with a supernatural fervor, those that were isolated into one-on-one combat were made into corpses. Our forces adapted quickly enough upon order from local commanders, ensuring that no deviation from an inter-locked shield wall was allowed, as our worgs and boar riders harried them with advances too quick to effectively counter.\n\nThe result was a victory, among the largest of the campaigns. Inserted beneath this report is an updated report of lost troops and armaments during the course of the battle, high command may find it peculiar."

 R62_start_the_xiadao_campaign_title: "Start the Xiadao Campaign"
 R62_start_the_xiadao_campaign_desc: "The land of the Xia is split among dozens of states, all vying for power under the yoke of a ruler with only nominal control over its internal tribes. Still, it appears that this nominal control is enough to bind its subjects to protect the ruler upon a war's declaration. Every last one of them, all pledged to defend the ruler of the Xia -- and in turn, the land itself -- to the last man.\n\nThis report puts forward a request to cease preparations and begin the campaign immediately. Based on present information, their forces can converge and unify within a matter of days. If we are to ensure a quick and decisive victory, we must act before the commander of the Xia can muster its splintered manpower into a united force capable of rivaling ours."

 R62_dissolve_the_mists_title: "Dissolve the Mists"
 R62_dissolve_the_mists_desc: "The issue of the odd, "mystical" mists as described by some troops has come to a head. For too long have our troops met their end at an untimely matter, clashing head-to-head with a force neither guns nor steel can banish... so far.\n\nWe have identified sources of this mist, its properties derived from local legendary sites. Artificers under our employ, whose names and achievements can be seen in the attached parchment, have identified certain solutions for this ethereal menace, which we may be rid ourselves of with decisive action and a hefty sum to compensate these individuals. The northern Oni have also volunteered themselves to banish this mist with a degree of malevolent fervor, not that it concerns us what their reason may be, just that it be done as soon as possible."

 R62_victor_of_the_xiadao_title: "Victor of the Xiadao"
 R62_victor_of_the_xiadao_desc: "Great tidings from the front. The prized city of the Xiaken and its respective temple and fort have been brought into our fold. Many will herald this moment as the day the war was won, and all the Xia were doomed to fall to our hands. The truth I may posit comes down to our superior management of supply lines and discipline, but I fear that may be a side of history that will go unremembered. The truth that the war was won the moment we set our eyes on this land ripe for conquest."

 R62_inspect_the_temple_title: "Inspect the Temple"
 R62_inspect_the_temple_desc: "This is an inventory report of the spoils received during the Xiadao campaign and its subsequent looting. As of the current date this is an incomplete report, much has been left unaccounted for, and looters from our less disciplined ranks can find themselves suffering from their impatience. One thing can be said for sure, however, and that is that these monks did not live as modestly as they claimed. Several tons of gold and precious stones have been smelted down and repurposed into bars, to be carted to the capital as soon as enough worgs can be procured for such a task.\n\nAnyway, beginning with the ornate combs..."

 R62_shattering_the_alliance_title: "Shattering the Alliance"
 R62_shattering_the_alliance_desc: "This is a report from Xiadao central intelligence. The stragglers have been neutralized, all that remains now are silent fields and a subservient populace. The marches and mock battles that used to harry the townspeople with their grating, noisy disunity are gone - replaced with the melodious sound of hobgoblin troops patrolling the land. True and final victory has been achieved."

 R62_start_the_shamakhad_campaign_title: "Strike for Shamakhad"
 R62_start_the_shamakhad_campaign_desc: "Mere decades have passed since we destroyed the disorganized kingdoms of northern Shamakhad, but our dominance over the region remains contested. The Marshals know this is unacceptable. We must therefore pacify the southern holdouts and cement our control over these fertile plains."

 R62_seize_the_ancient_cities_title: "Seize the Ancient Cities"
 R62_seize_the_ancient_cities_desc: "While Shamakhad is an old and wealthy land, there are certain cities in this region that are older and wealthier than the rest. With these cities in our hands, we would be able to exert our authority over all of Shamakhad. Let us thus expand our dominion and incorporate these territories into this Great Command."

 R62_a_final_ruin_title: "A Final Ruin"
 R62_a_final_ruin_desc: "Our dominance over Shamakhad is undisputed, and all of those who would deny this basic fact have been brought to heel. The time has come for us to rest, and till the fields, and fill our granaries and warehouses, before preparations for the next campaign begin anew."

 R62_the_ramp_of_sarnihanpur_title: "The Ramp of Sarnihanpur"
 R62_the_ramp_of_sarnihanpur_desc: "Our human subjects say that Sarnihanpur is the oldest city in Rahen, but such a pedigree has not been of much use to it. We have surrounded it, and its inhabitants are resisting us fiercely. One thing must be said, though; they fight well, and our casualties are mounting.\n\nThe time has come to commit to breaking Sarnihanpur, and our engineers have just the solution - a mammoth ramp, extending from the rolling plains that surround the city to arc over the walls. We will defend this ramp against all attacks, and once it is completed, we shall surge over the walls and put an end to this thorn in our side."

 R62_the_spoils_of_war_title: "The Spoils of War"
 R62_the_spoils_of_war_desc: "We have taken Sarnihanpur, the oldest city in Rahen, the ancient capital of the "Nadimraj", and may now enjoy the fruits of our labour. Its granaries have been yoked to our supply lines, and its vaults shall fund our future campaigns. Its people, too, shall labour on the fields and in our mines, in service to our Great Command. Our rule over Shamakhad is now ironclad."

 R62_construct_a_river_fleet_title: "Construct A River Fleet"
 R62_construct_a_river_fleet_desc: "The fortified city of Bianfang serves as a gate along the Yan river, greatly limiting our ability to supply troops downstream. One of the Sunyanin proposed the construction of the first hobgoblin river fleet to besiege Bianfang along the Yan while it is besieged from land. With the Grand Marshal’s approval, this plan will be put into motion and we will gain the upper hand in the siege of Bianfang."

 R62_move_the_fleet_downriver_title: "Move the Fleet Downriver"
 R62_move_the_fleet_downriver_desc: "According to our new subjects in Bianfang, Jincheng is the seat of the Eternal Council of Jingqiu. They claim that the eunuchs of Jingqiu practice dark magics and siphon the chi of others to sustain their own lives. Based on this information a request for more korashi chains has been made by the commanding officers and will be delivered before we move to subdue the city.\n\nOnce the river fleet has been repaired and a new set of chains have been imported, the river fleet shall move towards Jincheng. This two pronged assault will stretch the resources of the defenders thin and allow our forces to break through like they did in Bianfang."

 R62_the_third_city_title: "The Third City"
 R62_the_third_city_desc: "Our reports on Szicheng suggest that it was originally built as an army camp to protect the nearby cities within the league of Yanszin. If seized, it could serve as a hub for our military operations in lower Yanshen. Therefore the river fleet must be employed again to seize this city and grant us access to a vital military center farther into Yanshen.\n\nOur generals, captains and lieutenants have become much more adept at utilizing the river fleet in conjunction with our kikun over the course of this campaign. The hardships faced and lessons learned from the first two excursions of the river fleet will allow us to employ more advanced maneuvers to overcome the defenses of Szicheng."

 R62_start_the_bianfang_campaign_title: "Bianfang Belligerence"
 R62_start_the_bianfang_campaign_desc: "Yanshen is a divided and chaotic land ripe for conquest. With Xiadao secured, we can now look eastwards down the Yan. Our intelligence has found that the Yan river is guarded by the city of Bianfang, meaning that it and the surrounding region must be secured before our advance into Yanshen can truly begin.\n\nTherefore the White Dragon of Bianfang has become our first obstacle to expansion in Yanshen, and their fall shall form the foundation of our operations in Yanshen."

 R62_by_the_throat_title: "By the Throat"
 R62_by_the_throat_desc: "The siege of Bianfang has succeeded and the city is now firmly under our control. This has greatly weakened the warlord state of Bianfang and renders all the great cities of the Yan vulnerable to our forces.\n\nBianfang will serve as a key military base in our conquests of upper Yanshen. Additionally, it seems as though the warlord of Bianfang sought to unify Yanshen under their banner, with the city in our hands, the plans, intelligence and personnel that were being gathered for this can be repurposed to fit our ambitions in Yanshen."

 R62_the_superior_drill_title: "The Superior Drill"
 R62_the_superior_drill_desc: "The armies of Bianfang possessed much greater organization and cohesion than any of the disorganized rabble we have faced so far. They fought with a unity and ferocity that approached the standards of a true hobgoblin kikun. Their commitment to order is admirable, but in the end they were unable to match the absolute discipline shown by our troops. While logistics and tactics were key in our triumph over Bianfang, we ultimately possessed the superior drill.\n\nWe have slain the White Dragon and with their fall all the realms down the Yan are open to the Great Command."

 R62_secure_the_hill_fortification_title: "Secure the Hill Fort"
 R62_secure_the_hill_fortification_desc: "Hubao is a vital fortress in protecting Yanshen from the west. With it now under our control we must make efforts to expand the fortifications and cement our control over the area to ensure that we cannot be flanked and have our logistics system cut off in any future wars in the region.\n\nHubao possesses greater significance than being a strategic fort. We have learned that it is one of the last vestiges of Harimar the Great's conquests in Yanshen. This remnant of great conquest serves as a reminder of the prowess that any Great Marshal must aspire to surpass. "

 R62_break_the_northern_guard_title: "Break the Northern Guard"
 R62_break_the_northern_guard_desc: "The northern flank of the Harimraj is strong and sturdy, but it is not impenetrable. In fact, our agents’ reports indicate that they have grown complacent in recent years. Occupying the two fortresses of Pordhatti and Tiltaghar -- which, between them, guard the rest of Rahen -- will shatter the so-called unity of the harimari, especially if this is done simultaneously."

 R62_start_the_ghavaanaj_campaign_title: "Gunning for Ghavaanaj"
 R62_start_the_ghavaanaj_campaign_desc: "West of the Kharunyana lies the Ghavaanaji Plain, a vast, arid land that dominates Middle Rahen. It is from here that the trumpeting elephants of our enemies originate. Sovereignty in this region is split between a number of squabbling "elephant-lords", making it especially vulnerable.\n\nGiven recent acquisitions, we should strike while the iron is hot and obliterate the Ghavaanaji and their elephant herds before those vast creatures grow even larger."

 R62_dont_get_trampled_title: "Don't Get Trampled!"
 R62_dont_get_trampled_desc: "Many an Edan has met its end beneath the stomping feet of a rampaging elephant. As our campaign approaches its climax, we have begun to place the elephant hordes under tighter and tighter control. The native Ghavaanaji may think themselves masters of these beasts, but many of them have been trampled as well.\n\nIt is clear that the elephants are a danger to all thinking creatures, and their movement must be tightly curtailed if we are to prosper. Moreover, keeping the elephants under strict guard shall serve as propaganda to show that we have truly tamed Ghavaanaj."

 R62_bulwark_of_elephants_title: "Bulwark of Elephants"
 R62_bulwark_of_elephants_desc: "With all of Ghavaanaj under our control, we may loosen restrictions on the elephant herds. The Grand Marshal has made clear to us that we must not be complacent, however; one wrong step, and a revolt could break out, led by the sullen elephant-riders whom we have conquered.\n\nAs such, we shall begin conditioning the elephants in these lands to accept us as riders. Who knows? One day, it may well be that we shall see a hobgoblin sitting atop an elephant, riding down his foes as our new Ghavaanaji subjects once did."

 R62_the_bombardment_of_khiraspid_desc: "The Great Dhujat War (or the War of the Triple Alliance) began in 1572 when the Command resumed its slow, inexorable advance southwards. In six years, all of Dhujat had been occupied… all but one city. Now, as hundreds of artillery crews train their sights on Khiraspid’s walls, the Command is preparing to make an example of the Porcelain Gate - one that Rahen shall not soon forget."

 R62_start_the_dhujat_campaign_title: "Start the Dhujat Campaign"
 R62_start_the_dhujat_campaign_desc: "Wealthy and dominated by enormous urban conurbations, most notably the Porcelain Cities, Dhujat straddled both banks of the Kharunyana, making it a truly vital region to control for any aspiring conqueror. Moreover, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the region was politically divided, leaving the path to conquest wide open. Thus, in 1507, the Command invaded Pordhatti in its first thrust into Dhujat."

 R62_down_the_great_river_desc: "The Porcelain Cities have seen sense, and have submitted to our rule. Our dominion has expanded once more, encompassing the length of the Kharunyana, but now is not a time for rest, because there are enemies all around, and constant conquest is a necessity in a world such as this. Dhujat, after all, is but a stepping-stone to greater things."

 R62_the_fate_of_the_oracle_title: "The Fate of the Oracle"
 R62_the_fate_of_the_oracle_desc: "The Oracles of Tughayasa are said to be wise beyond measure, which is all well and good. A more relevant trait, however, is that many humans hold them in high esteem, which would make them a useful servant to have, as having their support would greatly reduce unrest within our human-majority territories. Moreover, it may be possible to weaponize their esoteric knowledge to secure more victories in the future. Once Tughayasa is secured, the Grand Marshal should pay them a visit and see what they have to say for themselves."

 R62_the_heart_of_haless_desc: "There are many great and wealthy cities in Dhujat, but the greatest of them all is indisputably Sarisung. Located at the confluence of the rivers Kharunyana and Telkhram, it may well be the most strategically significant settlement in all of Haless. To start with, however, Dhujat will suffice. For our control over this region to be uncontested, we must seize it from its current owners."

 R62_order_out_of_chaos_title: "Order Out of Chaos"
 R62_order_out_of_chaos_desc: "We have restored order in Dhujat, which is no small feat, since -- to our understanding -- the region has been embroiled in chaos for quite some time. However, it is one thing to restore order, and quite another to maintain it. As such, we shall invest five Yuyuanin within Sarisung as a rapid reaction force ever-ready to quash rebellions and uprisings against our rule."

 R62_threaten_mercenary_executions_title: "Mercenary Executions"
 R62_threaten_mercenary_executions_desc: "It appears that the mercenaries serving in the Bhuvauri armies have been labouring under the wrong impression for quite some time. They have assumed that we would permit them to withdraw or surrender - that we would treat them as though they were special, as though they were distinct, as though they were a separate class of soldier.\n\nThey thought wrong."

 R62_raheni_slavery_desc: "The Great Ishudhen Slave Market is and remains the beating heart of the Raheni slave trade, with the roads and rivers of Rahen its veins and arteries, carrying the enslaved to their new homes.

 R62_start_the_bhuvauri_campaign_desc: "Through their control of the Kharunyana Delta and their access to vast hordes of enslaved soldiers, the merchant-lords of the Grand Republic of Bhuvauri have the potential to become a significant thorn in our side. Securing Sramaya, moreover, would grant us access to their reserves of coin and enslaved labour. Therefore, they are the most logical target for our forces."

 R62_the_kharunyana_fleet_desc: "Our adversaries have fortified the city of Sramaya, and it now falls to us to seize it and decapitate all resistance. Over the years, we have built up a sizable fleet of mercantile vessels plying the waters of the Kharunyana, and the time has come to put it to good use.

 R62_the_southern_cities_desc: "The Porcelain Cities may be wealthy beyond compare, but true authority stems from the cities that clutter the length of the Dhenbasana. We do not know much of local history, but we know it was here the first Rahenraj began, and it is home to all Rahen’s great capitals.\n\nIn order for our authority over Rahen to be truly unchallenged, we must seize these capitals -- every last one -- and force them to acknowledge our rule."

 R62_the_palace_city_desc: "Though its fellows are great, Dhenijansar is greater still. Many who pass through its gates depart convinced that it is no city, but rather an immense palace-complex, built to serve whosoever rules Rahen. All things in Dhenijansar revolved around the Raja… but no longer.\n\nDhenijansar is ours, and the Harimraj with it. Even now, our men have begun cataloguing the treasures of this palace-city, sorting out which can be sold and which should be moved up north to our capital for storage in our vaults.

 R62_visit_the_hall_of_endless_debate_title: "Visit the Hall of Endless Debate"
 R62_visit_the_hall_of_endless_debate_desc: "The idea of "Endless Debate" encapsulates the decay of Rahen; bickering bureaucrats perpetually feuding over inconsequential matters while the land decays. Still, once it was a place of wisdom, where great men met to discuss the future of this rich land. Their words are immortalized here, and there is much our Grand Marshal can learn from their stories"

 R62_start_the_rakhadesh_campaign_desc: "The Ruin Kingdoms now live up to their name, and with their fall the hills of Rakhadesh present themselves before us. Some of the humans of West Rahen in many ways live similarly to how we once did before our rise to greatness – pastoral herders divided by petty feuding over grazing rights. Others live in lavish fortresses watching over the rushing rivers which divide the region. It is critical this strategic region be brought to heel.\n\nOur intelligence reports the land is split between the Narajandi and Dhenbasana rivers, one flowing north and the other south. With them under our control, the western border of our domain will be all but secure, and open the path towards the wealthiest lands of Rahen and Haless."

 R62_the_backwater_campaign_desc: ""The furthest reaches of Rahen have proven more difficult to control. Some of the herdsmen conceal themselves in the hills and valleys of Ghankedhen. At worst, they defy us with ferocity, and at best they still persist in blissful unawareness of our existence. We request orders as how to best control these areas." -Missive from Grand Captain Bekun Wolfborn\n\nIt has been decreed that in order to solidify control over these areas, Senunin shall be dispatched to demand oaths of loyalty from each patriarch. Should they refuse, the family lines they hold so sacred shall be severed. Such are the demands of the Grand Marshal."

 R62_the_root_gate_desc: "The hold of Grôzumdihr has long dominated the movement between Rahen and the Tree of Stone, but it is time that changed. Regardless of who controls the Tree, it is imperative the Great Command keeps a close eye over activities in the region. We must build a bulwark against the horrors which lurk in the darkness, whether those are goblins, dwarves or something even worse."

 R62_start_the_rahen_coast_campaign_title: "Conquer the Coast"
 R62_start_the_rahen_coast_campaign_desc: "Few Hobgoblins have ever seen a coast, much less a sea. The very concept of such a vast body of water is a relatively new addition to our conception of Halann, as for most of our existence we have only known the dry air of Northern Rahen. The Marshals are skeptical of tales of the concept of a body of water without end, blaming the naive romanticism of the men of the south.\n\nWhile many such tales are likely an exaggeration, the fact remains that vast wealth is housed in the cities along the Rahen Coast, metropolises of decadence and degeneracy. They shall be ours, and they shall be cleansed of the corruption which complacency has wrought."

 R62_an_unusual_frontier_desc: "The land known as Harimar’s Cradle is utterly foreign to us. For centuries, we have known only the forested hinterlands of Halessi hills. Yet as our soldiers push further south, we find a bizarre landscape: twisting vines and towering trees sustained by near-constant rainfall, a green hell where disease seems as deadly as the claws of a Harimari charger.\n\nSome of our men rot from the inside out, their very skin falling off their bones from sicknesses unknown to us. It is no matter. Regardless of the harshness of this land, we shall endure. Nay, we shall thrive, and despite the harshness of this place it shall be ours, as all Rahen will one day be. The vines shall be torn, and the jungle shall be tamed. It is our destiny, our birthright."

 R62_enlist_naval_experts_desc: "It is quite embarrassing that despite our clear dominance upon the field of battle, our naval ability is…lacking. Before now, our only naval experience came from trading vessels traversing the many rivers within The Great Command.\n\nOne marshal proposed that humans, with their experience in the field, be entrusted with the raising of a navy. While this initially caused great uproar within the War Room, eventually all conceded that humans would be instrumental in projecting our power on the seas, even if it struck a blow to hobgoblin pride."

In our current campaign, we have achieved superiority on land and, for the first time, sea against our adversary.

Her defenders entrench themselves against our Kikunin, having learned well from tales of our earlier conquests. However, the Merchant-Lords of the city are woefully unprepared for a seaborne assault.\n\nTo the cannons, men! Let the Raheni know that there is no field of battle where the Great Command will not prevail!"

 R62_the_kharunyana_fords_desc: "The Kharunyana has long been known to be the mightiest river in Haless, and perhaps all of Halann, however as hobgoblin soldiers mass upon the western bank of the Kharunyana an unexpected issue has arisen. The river has proven too massive and swift to ford as has been done throughout our campaigns so far. There is a solution. Large bridges over the rivers exist in the cities of Phanbang and Semphreong. It is time to send our armies over these bridges and claim these porcelain cities for our own."

 R62_start_the_telebei_campaign_desc: "The region south of the declining Raj and defeated Xiaken, stands weak and divided. It serves as the gateway to the great plain of Thidinkai, and is therefore becoming increasingly important to incorporate into the Command, let alone the area’s own riches. There are two ways in which the Grand Marshal’s advisors have suggested to start the invasion; from the east, over the Kharunyana river, or from the north. The Grand Marshal need only choose the direction of the initial attack."

 R62_spirit_bastions_title: "Spirit Bastions"
 R62_spirit_bastions_desc: "Northern Bomdan centered around the Telebei river has always been an area renowned for its defensive fortifications and difficulty to be invaded. As our conquests here continue, this image is being eroded. However, there are definitely useful fortifications that have been built in the region, specifically the series of forts known as the Btei. Controlling these forts will not only allow us to consolidate our gains here but also defend properly against the inevitable revolts by the locals that will follow."

While before the Bomdan was divided and weak, this will never be the case again. Today there is only one empire in the Bomdan, that of the Command."\n-Grand Marshal [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s speech to the combined commands upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arrival in Bim Lau."

 R62_the_telebei_forts_desc: "The two strongest powers in the Telebei Basin are easily Bim Lau and Lot Dekkang. Until these two fiefdoms are pacified no conquest of northern Bomdan would be complete. Beyond their strategic value, both of these forts must be under our control to secure our position. Bim Lau contains a great necropolis, which must not be allowed to remain influenced by mages. Even more importantly, Lot Dekkang’s capital holds the largest population of hobgoblins outside of the Command. This cannot stand."

 R62_no_harbouring_deserters_desc: "While hobgoblins rarely break from established society, deviants do exist who chafed under the Command structure. They deserted. Betrayed their brothers. When they did this, they abandoned their place in hobgoblin society and became criminals. Most of these hobgoblins would eventually settle in Lapnam Amrik, utilizing the skills of war learned in the Command against us. While some of these hobgoblins were even born outside of the Command, it does not matter, the betrayal of their fathers lies within them still. These deserters must be exterminated, and any who helped them must be taught a lesson: to betray the Command is to forfeit your life."

 R62_geometric_warfare_title: "Geographic Warfare"
 R62_geometric_warfare_desc: "Many of the fortified locations in Hukai are integrated with their surroundings, often featuring less-than-ideal terrain to carry out assaults and having little space to dedicate to artillery batteries. Naturally, a solution will need to be found to these problems.\n\nA team of trained natural scientists incorporated into each army's Sunyanin will be able to analyze the geography of each problematic fortress, discovering the vulnerable areas that must be attacked in order to quicken a siege operation"

 R62_bom_climbers_employed_desc: "The Bom humans of the region are generally very proficient climbers, capable of scaling the forts of the region with an ease unmatched by any others in the region. In a region such as this, these talents are profoundly valuable.\n\nInstead of letting this potential simply go to waste, we can employ cooperative Bom to scale the walls of Khabtei Teleni and sabotage the defenders in any way possible. It will more than likely hasten the siege considerably."

 R62_start_the_hukai_campaign_desc: "Campaigning into Hukai, the southern areas of Bomdan, is a necessity in order to prepare future incursions into the western Thidinkai and against Baihon Xinh. The warlords in the region rule over large populations, concentrated in fortress-cities.\n\nThe Grand Marshal will need to prove their ability to efficiently pacify settlements that are designed from inception to be fortresses, in tandem with being able to organize the capture of these fortified locations."

 R62_12_sides_shattered_title: "12 Sides Shattered"
 R62_12_sides_shattered_desc: "The city of Khabtei Teleni is especially well designed, displaying a competence in engineering that far outstrips the status of the warlord inhabiting it. It is surrounded by a twelve-sided fortification, designed such that each side is capable of providing fire support to at least one other side of the fortifications.\n\nEven after having several segments damaged beyond use, the defenders were able to offer substantial resistance against attacking forces. One can only imagine the utility of this city under hobgoblin control."

 R62_the_fortress_cities_title: "The Fortress Cities"
 R62_the_fortress_cities_desc: "Khabtei Teleni is not the only fortress-city in Hukai, though it is the most renowned. These fortresses are very frequent, combining plentiful supply stores, favourable terrain, and high-quality engineering into veritable citadels across the countryside. Once a large enough portion of these fortress cities is pacified, it will be appropriate to declare the campaign a success."

 R62_no_hold_left_untouched_desc: "Verkal Ozovar focused the majority of its resources on protecting its subjects in the surrounding farmlands, as opposed to ensuring its own defenses were adequately prepared. The Hold fell quickly -- and we have centuries of experience in what comes next. Sack it all, loot every piece, and ensure even the deepest tunnels cannot support resistance."

 R62_start_the_sikai_campaign_desc: "The areas that constitute northern Thidinkai are known collectively as Sikai, a land that spans approximately from the township of Azkare to the dwarf hold of Verkal Ozovar. Conquering this land is a necessity to prove the Grand Marshal's acumen and to secure a path for future campaigns.

 R62_local_command_support_sikai_desc: "The Elephant Command has acclimated to the local terrain remarkably quickly, with Elephant divisions displaying a noticeably increased performance in the fields of Sikai as compared to other groups. Affiliated troops are already being contributed as expected, but there is most definitely a possible contribution that is not already being made - winning over the Elephant Marshal will persuade them to offer it up."

 R62_start_the_baihon_xinh_campaign_desc: "Our scouts report the hegemon of the Thidinkai region, Baihon Xinh, is currently in a state of recovery following a civil war. If this state can be destroyed, there will be no polities in the region capable of providing meaningful resistance to further campaigns. Resistance will likely be strongest in the areas of Mo Hoang and Hon Sai, the Empire’s heartlands. If the Grand Marshall is to prove themselves dedicated to the security of the Great Command, this struggling -- yet threatening -- empire needs to be destroyed."

 R62_the_kai_empire_desc: "You can defeat an enemy by slaying every army against you. Alternatively, you can simply sever a foe from their ability to gather resources from their territory, depriving them of manpower and crippling their logistics.\n\nLet us use the latter for Baihon Xinh.

 R62_welcome_to_the_rice_fields_desc: "The northern areas of the Thidinkai are incredibly fertile, and as a result are host to vast tracts of farmland, whose output appears to be exceptionally high.\n\nIn order to ease the strain on our logistics, food can be seized from these farms and redistributed to our soldiers in the area, capable of arriving much faster and being much easier to keep stock of than rations from elsewhere."

Now and forevermore, these statelets are united under one banner - ours.\n\nIn time, these lesser divisions will be forgotten, replaced by loyalty to the state.

 R62_train_jungle_fighters_desc: "Our soldiers know how to fight in vast plains or mountain foothills. Less so the rainforest, with its extreme humidity, dangerous wildlife, and strong foliage.\n\nThis problem can be solved by employing orcs - their thick hides and rugged constitution allows them to fight on in conditions where the local wildlife or even the climate would have killed a hobgoblin. All that will be required is to train them properly and then set them loose."

 R62_lupulan_campaign_middle_title: "Soldiering South"
 R62_lupulan_campaign_middle_desc: "A significant sum of the rainforest has been pacified, though not without difficulty - the terrain is particularly hostile to navigate and much of the "character" of the area has had to be learned through direct experience.

 R62_command_of_the_sea_desc: "Our recently-acquired capabilities for shipbuilding allow for some doctrinal experimentation. The War Room’s consensus is that the navy requires a ship that is capable of directing and leading the rest of the fleet, just as the Grand Marshal directs the Great Command.\n\nThis flagship will act as the center for the at-sea admiralty, the location from which they will have the ability to navigate efficiently while also coordinating fleet actions during battle."

Initial probing attacks were met with strong resistance, but they attempted to break our center as we spread our forces to hit their flanks.\n\nOur center fell back as the divisions on the sides collapsed in, trapping the charging Yanszin troops, and breaking the morale of the remaining defenders. As the retreat began across Lake Tianhu, we launched a small fleet of our own, laden with oil and set ablaze, into the tethered vessels, while our worgs and boar riders set upon their confused defensive line, decimating their ranks.\n\nThe result was a decisive victory, the largest in the campaign.

The blade supposedly had the power to nullify any magic it touched, a power we deeply desire. Naturally, the Grand Marshal hoped to get his hands on the blade to ensure the Command’s dominance over shamans and mages.\n\nUnfortunately we failed to secure the blade, by the time our forces reached the temple the keepers of the blade had escaped with Kongren and our attempts to find them in the jungles surrounding Jianxusi turned up nothing. While no longer possessing the blade itself, the temple is filled with texts on the keepers’ blade dancing techniques. The Grand Marshal has taken it upon himself to learn these techniques from the remaining writings and the keepers.

He realized that despite the harpies' gift of flight, they were vulnerable where they kept their young, their roost.\n\nTo avoid pointless losses to attrition the lieutenant senior assembled equipment and trained his troops to go on a daring expedition to destroy the harpy nest and bring them to heel. After weeks of preparation the lieutenant and what remained of his senun climbed the mountain in the dead of night and destroyed their roost. The harpies fought back, but they lacked their ferocity in battle while on the defensive and were put down.\n\nThe lieutenant’s valor and resourcefulness have enabled our operations in the southern hills to continue without constant harpy harassment. Based on this accomplishment, I propose an exaltation of leadership, such that the lieutenant commander be granted the rank of captain."

When his Unta was ambushed by local resistance deep within enemy territory, reports from band members illustrate that Keziniku was there to pick up the slack upon his sergeant’s death and was able to organize his men and turn the ambush into a rout. He did this by setting fire to an area of the jungle infested by enemies using their own alchemical supplies against them. For this, the troops have taken to calling him "The Dragon".

Lesser conquerors have ignored the region, and their conquests faltered. Naturally, we will not make this mistake. Thus, it is critical that we ensure their subjugation.

Our armies have long grown adept at subduing Raheni forts, but these Yansheni ones still require more expertise.

With the recent establishment of the Jade March, as well as reports of consolidation and expansion within the Tree, we may now have to reassess this perspective. Dwarf recolonization and goblin consolidation prove potential threats to our hold over the Jade Mines, as well as our surface territory bordering the mountains. It is thus imperative that we strike first. Prepare our troops and send word to the Jade March.

Already Jade March explorers and settlers have ventured into the region, mapped out tunnels, and begun taking root. Nevertheless, there is one resource they have been largely squandering- the local goblin clans. Many are disorganized and weak, and with proper application of force, could be brought into the fold.

Rather than direct military pacification, they have suggested a program of settlement with loyal goblin subjects in order to bring these areas to heel.

It is saps our soldiers’ strength and substantially reduces visibility - there are cases where Oni have been discovered operating just out of view of hobgoblin forces, only to be discovered by simple chance.\n\nBut the recent Battle of the Mist perhaps marked a turning point: it went poorly at first, an Oni army’s charge  savaging defensive positions, later retreating into the mist before we could mount a counter-offensive, and then charging a new location. But the commanding General began burning fires and directing the smoke outwards, nullifying the advantage provided by the mist. This stratagem showed promise -- an Exaltation for that hobgoblin, and an adaptation to our tactics, is in order!"

All aspects of the nation rely on the elephants to produce and deliver both raw and processed goods to maintain the constant campaigns we find ourselves embroiled in. It is no exaggeration to say that the materials they transport are the very lifeblood of the nation, facilitating our health and growth until we stand above Haless unopposed.

Monumental ivory-encrusted walls, both majestic and impenetrable, shall stand between us and our foes, who will be like lambs to the slaughter, caught in an intricate series of trenches and pitfalls. But perhaps the most impressive of these feats of engineering is a result of the Sunyanin’s genius -- a waterworks system of elephant-operated dikes and pumps to ensure both proper defense from flooding and a simple method of washing away our foes with the flip of a lever.\n\nAs blood spills and enriches the soil, we need only watch and wait for our weakened foes to deliver themselves to us."

And, when they looked to the looming Serpentspine, they feared an unending tide of savage monsters, the stuff of exiled dwarves' tales. The hobgoblin tribes who lived in the foothills were a pest and a nuisance, but merely that. They feared the wrong thing.\n\nThat is obvious as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] surveys the armies assembled before him in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Off to one side lay the Ninyu Kikun, the Grand Marshal's elite; on the other, the slave state rabble of the Zanyu Kikunin.

Ten soldiers in a team, all of whom hope to one day rise and command one of those grouping themselves.\n\nOn the flanks, the Gikunin cavalry: three worg-riding tribes, the elites of their command and given the massive wolves to train and ride. Some say the Worg-Lieutenants and Crested Riders who serve as subordinates here are nigh-bestial themselves, but such voices are few and far between -- their charges tend not to leave survivors.\n\nThis is the hobgoblin army.

He argued that this was dangerous because the temples held immense magical power. With a glint of excitement behind his dark eyes, he assured Grand Marshal [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the Oni were more than equipped to guard and control these dangerous temples, just as they assist with supplying Korashi and that should the Grand Marshal only ask, he will dispatch Oni experts to these high temples to secure the safety of all."

Instead, the loyal soldiers of the Command display only stoic resolve as they ready for their task. None of them will enjoy it, but done for the Command, it will be a chore, like any other.\n\n"You hobgoblin scum! First you demand the subservience of we great and powerful oni, and now this is how you treat us?!"

However, they instead nearly destroyed the entire hobgoblin race altogether in their foolish, short-sighted endeavor.\n\nSince then, hobgoblins have never once trusted magic-users. Once, we even killed every person with even the slightest trace of magical ability, no matter who they were. Too much work has gone into creating our Great Command, and never would we allow a selfish, conceited magic-user to ruin it.\n\nHowever, recent years have brought great developments to the way that we handle the shamans that live among us. The Oni granted us the secrets of korashi, and now there are enough chains of the anti-magic material in our possession to bind the whole of Halann, if we had the mind to. Instead, we’ll settle for binding every single last shaman in Rahen. Anybody who uses magic in Rahen from now on will only do so as a walking weapon or as a living tool for the Great Command. In that way, at least, those monstrous creatures can serve the greater good, rather than their own narcissistic desires.\n\nIn the end, even the perpetually egocentric shamans will learn the eternal lesson: It is better to die for the Command, than to live for yourself."

Accusations of clans looking for any excuse to reduce rival clans’ holdings to cinders with a gleeful maliciousness only found in Undergrowth Goblins with an axe to grind. These conflicts could potentially harm production within the Jade Mines, and only aim to increase worry with other coinciding reports of heavy infighting within the streets of The Belly. It is unclear if this a displeased group of slaves or something much deeper. Either way the might of the Command should not be challenged by the likes of mere slaves!"

This unease threatens to boil over into full blown conflict if it is not handled properly- thankfully the two clans have come together to discuss land settlements. There is an opportunity to mediate these meetings and ensure some semblance of order to be restored via our guiding hand, but the option to let them handle their own problems internally is available, if we trust them to come to a, "positive", conclusion.

A concerned family nurse has come forward with a story almost too tragic in nature to be believed, but if to be believed has only added onto the previously seen complications between Stolen Gem and Blackstep.\n\nAn unknown wandering goblin vagabond hailing from the Stolen Gem has taken the hand of one meant to be betrothed to another in an arranged marriage intended to reduce tensions. Should we react quickly to such an event, we may be able to recover our face from the view of the people. Some argue for acceptance of such acts perpetrated in pursuit of such noble ambitions like the love for another, regardless of societal differences or obstructions.

 the_command.13.desc: "A large, stone circular table surrounds a pair of bickering, snippering Undergrowth Goblin elders. Various banners representing elite clans of the different Estates hang over a handful of Hobgoblin administrators. Bone talismans jingle alongside high pitch squeals, sneers and grumbling filling the large, empty amphitheatre with their incessant noise as candles lit hours prior begin burning out at their stems. A tired looking hobgoblin administrator looks to his peers for affirmation before banging a gavel onto the stone desk, the loud echoing bangs momentarily overpowering the noise and thus stopping the feud and drawing both elders' attention.\n\n"Respectable Elder Chiefnort, wise Elder Ga’ba Biggatooth. We have been gracious enough to host your… rapport for as long as we have – but we have unanimously agreed a final decision needs to be made. Chiefnort of Stolen Gem, your call to arms originated from finding ‘the mightiest fungus you had ever laid eyes on’, well within Stolen Gem’s territorial claims. There is an additional claim of this mushroom-like substance helping your workers concentrate, allowing for a greater yield in your tithe. On the other hand, Plek of Blackstep argues this cave rightly belonged to Blackstep and its people long before the… ‘Gem crunching snot for brains’, had any say in the matter. There was a mention of the aforementioned substance and its qualities increasing the pain tolerance of warriors, ignoring wounds most would deem fatal. Both very promising offers indeed, but only one of you will be granted this plot of cave and that will be the end of it. This dispute has run its course far and wide enough, and quite frankly more important matters need to be addressed.""

Our administrative staff within Grônstunad have begun to plan a transition to bring the goblins into the administration of the caves, and expand their work from simple mining operations to matters of logistics, food production, and smithing.\n\nOur beneficence in allowing the goblins more management of their own affairs also provides us an opportunity. We have long been vexed by the Undergrowth Goblin’s continued belief in the superstitious nonsense of the duplicitous shamans, but their continued existence served as an important focal point for the organization of the goblin clans. Now that we are reorganizing the clans, however, we can tear out this weed by its roots: for the goblin clans to run the mines, they must cast out the shamans and learn instead of discipline and order. To rise, they must follow the path of the Godlost.\n\nEnacting these changes will be no small feat – the goblins are ingenious (if bizarre) miners, but they will require dedicated support from our overseers, and we will need to carefully navigate the settlement of land between the Stolen Gem and Blackstep clans to ensure this transition is smooth. Such dedication of our resources necessitates that we choose only one clan to rule, but this will surely cause dissent from their rival. A deft hand must be clan in a mithril gauntlet for this matter – any who question our rule here shall not be allowed to question for long."

The chatter of thousands of hobgoblins fills the air along with the scent of horses, cattle, sweat and soaking rice, the ground mashed into a slurry of mud.

Tens of thousands, if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] erred, or had a stroke of brilliance. Such is the burden and responsibility of leadership, and of being [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of The Great Command.\n\nThat thought does not fade as [Root.Monarch.GetName] returns home from the command tent in [Root.Capital.GetName], but it does become… less salient. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] checks the house, but it is empty, despite the late hour.\n\nWith a smile, he walks around the dwelling to the dojo behind it. There, he is the victim of a savage ambush -- a trained warrior runs at him, weapon in hand.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s smile widens, and he strokes his moustache. His four year-old son comes to a sharp halt a few feet away, eyes widening. The training sword -- just a little longer than a dagger -- drops to the young man’s side, and he gives his father a solemn bow.\n\nAs his son kneels, [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s eyes sweep across the dojo. He sees his wife, sketching blueprints in the late afternoon sun. He sees his nephews, sparring paused, heads bowed in proper respect to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nHe waves them back to their training.

But notes about this intriguing overlap have reached the War Room all the way from Kamapar, because the similarities between our teachings and this ancient school of High Philosophy represent an opportunity.\n\nA Boar Martial, steeped in imperialist teachings, argues we should use this as leverage in further disseminating our way of life -- wherever we see a crack in the armor, we should strike. On the other hand, the Wolf's Prime Logistician, who is inclined to lenient teachings, argues we should not take the first opening but wait for maximal opportunity -- perhaps we might even learn something from the discussions?

 the_command.31.desc: "The Boar Marshal's visit to the front lines had been pleasant, and edifying. Though the reports that litter the War Room are detailed, they cannot capture the true experience of being on Campaign, and nor can they include every detail -- and sometimes, it is those details thought least important that prove decisive. As such, the Marshal was deep in thought as he and his honour guard marched back to [Root.Capital.GetName], scarcely seeing the scenery as he thought of strategy and tactics.\n\nAnd then, as their march took them through a small valley, they were ambushed. A human voice yelled a warning, but the Marshal's retinue scarcely had time to draw their blades before the rebels were upon them. Though their foes were disorganized and poorly-armed, they also outnumbered the Marshal's men at least three-to-one.\n\nThe Marshal slew one rebel, and then another, and then another, but even so he saw his guards fall around him. But no hobgoblin gives up a fight. Stab one rebel, slash a second and kick away a third -- but already another had a short-sword raised, about to strike. And then, like lightning out of a clear blue sky, the human was pierced by a well-thrown spear.\n\nWith a moment to breathe, the marshal put his guard back up, readying for a renewed attack. But he was amazed to see the rebels falling from an attack from the rear, by a sole human fighting with unparalleled ability. Seeing the tides turn, the rebels scrambled to kill the hated hobgoblin -- and while they scored a few nasty slices on his arms and chest, in minutes, the attack was over.\n\nThe man, named Atar Daya Gakhkhar, bowed low in formal apology before the marshal. He had tracked the rebel band for weeks, but did not know their destination, or would have intervened sooner. To atone for the deaths of the hobgoblin troops, which he failed to avert, he would serve as the marshal's escort for the remainder of the march.\n\nGahkhar seemed to see himself a man who had failed, despite the dozens of rebels he had slain today. But looking at the man, the Boar Marshal knew what he saw: a human with honour."

The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], saying not a word, picks it up and gives it a few practice strokes. The handle seems worn, but the edge remains sharp.\n\nIs the same true of Xianjie? A conquered land, whose edge remains well-honed? That is the question the temple’s master has beseeched the Marshals to answer, a question which went all the way up the chain of command. The two great campaigns that crushed the Xia saw countless of the temples’ soldiers slain, but most of the buildings themselves still stand. Do they have anything to offer The Great Command, in training and in practice? Or should they be demilitarized as with so many other conquered peoples, allowed to teach philosophy or work on artisan goods but never to raise blade or spear once more?\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] grunts, signaling the aged master to raise her head.

 the_command.33.desc: "The Command has outlawed magic except under the direct supervision of commanding officers. That much is well-known and well-established.\n\nWhat isn’t well-known or well-established, however, is where the ‘chi’ of the Xia falls in terms of that issue. On one hand, chi produces effects rather akin to magic, and a master of chi can be just as destructive as any rampaging shaman. On the other hand, the usage of chi requires a degree of discipline and self-control - qualities that most magic-users lack, but that the Command greatly respects. Additionally, there have - as of yet, anyways - been no reports of chi users making pacts with demons or devils, unlike what shamans have been wont to do.\n\nAs the Marshals see it, there are three paths available for the Command with regards to chi. Firstly, we can outlaw it in the same manner as they have with magic, though this would surely upset the chi users of the Xia. Secondly, we can leave it alone and allow chi users to function as before, though only time will tell what thousands of chi users in conquered territory might result in. Finally, the Command could attempt to integrate chi users and chi techniques as a whole into our military; while this would no doubt significantly increase our combat capabilities, there is also no doubt that reactionary forces within the Command would protest - perhaps violently - against what they see as just even more magic-users entering battle ranks.\n\nWhatever decision we come to, we must come to it now."

Many have started to work closely with clans that they share strong marital relations with and have in all but name merged in a phenomenon called Senunjoji or Clanmelting.\n\nIt is also these clans who now petition for the formal merger of their clans to regain their strength and numbers. Just like you would melt down and combine scraps of old iron into a strong new sword, they say, so too should their clans be united.\n\nAlternatively, we could also send the many orphanages of war to these wounded clans for them to be adopted, giving them the structure of a Band to grow up and train in. This is a practice which is not unheard of already, but could be expanded and formalized, allowing the clans a new generation to replace those lost on the battlefield."

The middle castes were condemned for greedily keeping their coin to themselves instead of supporting the Raj, while the middle castes claimed that the ministers and the upper castes had failed to protect them. While no one directly blamed the Raja, there were certainly looks that suggested they thought [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] unworthy as both ruler and protector of the Raj.\n\nAt the end of what felt like the longest day of the Raja’s reign, the Lotus Court dispersed for the day with little to show for it but soured moods. Unfortunately chaos within the court swiftly spread throughout the various realms of the Raj, further fracturing an already loosely governed realm. Some realms seek to use the chaos to consolidate their position within the Raj, others seek the protection of countries outside the Raj in the face of the threat of the Command, some even consider submitting to avoid the destruction that may come to their lands and people.\n\nDoes this mark the beginning of the end for the Raj?

Many of the realms were swept aside by the unstoppable force of the Command, and those who remained were left a shell of themselves.\n\nBut now emissaries have come from Sir, the great silken city that fell before the onslaught that swept so many of our sister states aside. Though browbeaten by the hobgoblins, Sir’s spirit remains, and they now seek allies who will raise their swords alongside them in a noble war to throw off the Command’s yoke. We stand to gain no land, but our strength will be shown to everyone throughout the realm, and our alliance with Sarnavan bolstered. Although the memory of our defeats of the last decade are still fresh, perhaps together, as one unified force, the Heroic Realms may yet prevail and retake the land that is ours. Shall we lend our support to Sir, despite the great danger of once again standing against the Chimera?"

 the_command.117.desc: "The Kenu-Ike met under a moonless night, the Grand Marshal's tent having been burnt to tatters. The three marshals approached each other, wind whistling through the leaves of the massive tree under which they stood. Their weapons formed a perimeter around the gathering, armor doffed as tradition dictated. Tradition was all they had left now.\n\nKuen, the Lionborn marshal, was a talented and shrewd administrator as well as a brilliant warrior, having earned his position at the tender age of 17. He spoke first. “The Ninyu Kikun is shattered. The camps are sieged. The Grand Marshal is slain. We have been forced to surrender.” Silence. Then Kuen spoke again, louder now. “Must it be war between the Commands? Can Moguwon’s dream not be saved? Are we simply to—“\n\nBei Wolfborn’s voice sliced through the night air. The marshal had secured his position through personal alliances, an enlightened autocrat if ever there was one. “Moguwon is dead. You remember the unity of which he spoke, the heady rush of possibility. You do not remember what it was like before: the Great Command would always have required a leader as strong as him. Without one, we descend into pointless bickering. As we are.”\n\nKuen looked to speak again, but before he could, Zau Boarbon made his move. The Boarborn marshal was a close companion of treachery, and now was no different. Taking one step forward, he reached into his robes and unsheathed a jagged black dagger. “Moguwon.” His face twisted into an expression of utter contempt. “Moguon was a FOOL, and he died like a fool. As will the two of you!” He lunged towards Kuen, who moved quickly to dislodge his spear from the ground and parry the assault.\n\nBei looked on somberly, and retrieved his own sword from the dirt. The three marshals withdrew, circling each other with weapons outstretched. The Kenu-Ike was the Sword-Home, a field of weapons with blades pointed out—a warning to the rest of the world, the beating heart of the Great Campaign. For the first time in decades, the blades were turned inwards, piercing the heart of the Command. The Kenu-Ike was dead."

While most rivalries eventually result in both parties trying to best the other, sometimes the two sides clash a bit more violently and the rivalry risks ending in open conflict between individuals, clans or banners with disaster, disorder and death as a result. To prevent these more heated rivalries from exploding into violence and throwing banners into disarray, rivalries are sometimes settled by forced arbitration in which the two parties can end their conflict by either single combat between the ringleaders, contractual ending of the rivalry through reparations, an oath of settlement or in rare cases a marriage between families or lastly by declaring one of the two parties the superior one and ending the rivalry by having the inferior party acknowledge defeat.\n\nOne of such rivalries has been brought to our attention as it involves two high level officers and their esteemed families.

An Exaltation is earned when a soldier, especially an officer distinguishes himself and gains the opportunity to rise through the ranks.

Stratocracy often leads to quizzical individuals rising to power, though never has a 26-year-old girl distinguished herself to the degree necessary for the status of Marshal. Young Hikari, daughter of Noriko Dragonborn, began her rise to the uncontested heir to the Dragon Command at the middling age of sixteen, rallying a band of local Ikigawan militiamen to fearlessly halt a Yan advance in its tracks. Since this ordeal, she has only continued to accrue achievements and has penned numerous treatises on the nature of modern warfare. This chain of ever escalating achievement swiftly earned her position as second in command to her mother. Upon the death of the late Dragon Marshal, there was no question of who shall take up the Dragon Banner.\n\nIt is impossible to mistake her intentions--her words ring out throughout the manor, each syllable lingering in the ears of [R62.Monarch.GetName]. Such plain defiance of the will of the Grand Marshal would warrant death in most cases, yet her words lack any semblance of hostility. It is a simple request. "Grant me the honour to serve the way my mother once did."\n\nHikari's eyes lock with [R62.Monarch.GetName]'s as [R62.Monarch.GetSheHe] considers her request. Direct succession was almost never permitted within the Command, nor was it usual for one so young to acquire the skill and experience needed to become a Marshal.

But that was the Command of ages past, before the bureaucracy, before the mass graves, before family became a cult subsumed under the state. Mother and daughter had not seen each other in five long years: Hikari Dragonborn was as busy as a prodigy could be, commanding loyalty first from her scrappy band of Ikaniwagain militiamen and eventually from forces greater still, until she ended up here at the foot of the Grand Marshal, requesting her last and greatest appointment—to that of Dragon Marshal.\n\nNoriko, for her part, had been busy with matters of state. Her ascension to Grand Marshal of the Great Command had led her to a life away from the roar of cannonfire and into the seclusion of the War Room. Perhaps it showed on her face, the blaze of valor that shone in her eyes dimmed by the eternal stress of governorship. And yet for all of that there was still something there, an expression of what could nearly be described as pride.\n\nMother and daughter studied each other, neither one totally familiar to the other, not after the past five years had changed them both. Then Noriko stepped down from the elevated throne, and Hikari stood up from her knees. Both rushed towards each other and clasped the other in a tight embrace. For a moment, there was no hierarchy, no Grand Marshal, no positions to be won or lost, no state and no country.\n\nThen the court official spoke the record aloud.

There was no need to gaze into the box, for through the cracks in the lid it was already clear that this parcel contained the head of the Great Command’s envoy to the Tiger Command. A crude way to declare war, but the message certainly came across.\n\nWith the beginning of the Great Insubordination, the Tiger, Elephant and Dragon Commands have moved their war camps and capitals farther from Shamakhad in preparation for war. These new capitals have all been fortified such that successfully sieging them without weakening their defenses first would be near-impossible. We must blow down the Tiger Command fortifications with a concentrated artillery strike, dwarven siege technology must be used against the Elephantine walls, and the metals that fuel the great cannons of the Dragon Command must be seized."
 the_command.1990.a: ""You've done well to deliver this important message. You are excused.""

 the_command.1991.d: "[R67.Monarch.GetName] stands before an audience of notable Raheni governors, both human and hobgoblin.\n\n"It is with a clear conscience and heavy heart that I protest the foolishly-shortsighted decision made by the Great Marshal [R62.Monarch.GetName] to deny the Tiger Command its rightful place alongside our brothers and sisters, letting the followers of the High Philosophy fester in poverty as hobgoblins from Shamakhad dominate the upper castes. We ask not for privilege or status, but mere coexistence with those that sought to plant us here, in a land that wishes our return to the caves from which we came. We ask not for strife, yet it finds its way to us. It is my regret to inform my distinguished guests that the Tiger Command shall henceforth formally sever itself from the existing military command structure, creating a parallel hierarchy headed by yours truly."\n\nSuch words only tip the scales further in the favor of bloodshed."
 the_command.1991.a: "Truly regrettable."

 the_command.1992.t: "Proclamation of [R68.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 the_command.1992.d: "Before a crowd of soldiers, Wuhyun and hobgoblin alike, Tyonkun unraveled a scroll and began to read.\n\n"Children of the Elephant! Despite being as powerful, as wealthy and advanced as all three "upper" commands combined, we are denied our rightful place in the Great Command! No matter how much we produce, no matter how effective our works are, they are taken for granted, as if these are things anyone can do - but I say: No more! Effective immediately, we are to sever ourselves from the Great Command such that we finally might claim our rightful place in the world! Who of your number shall fight for their sovereignty?!"\n\nThe entire crowd roared their approval."
 the_command.1992.a: "It won't take much more..."

 the_command.1993.t: "Proclamation of [R69.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 the_command.1993.d: "Hikari stood atop a stage, rows and rows of commanders, engineers, and inventors sitting before her. Listening.\n\n"I stand before you all to deliver unfortunate tidings! Over the course of the Dragon Command's existence, the "upper" commands have stifled our innovations, our inventions, even denied our resilience! I ask you all: would they have denied us if we were one of the three upper commands? No! Until we are given the presence we deserve - not least of which is the free access to the famous "War Room" - then we must refuse to constitute a part of the Great Command! If they do not believe that our Command is sufficiently experienced to provide counsel, then we will need to prove that we can provide it in droves! Who is with me?"\n\nOne clap, then another, and another, all the way until the audience's applause was deafening."
 the_command.1993.a: "A match has been lit.."

 the_command.1994.t: "The Tiger Muzzled"
 the_command.1994.d: "After years of gruelling warfare and a protracted siege, the gates of [R67.Capital.GetCapitalName] lay open. The city is a husk of what it once was, the river that once brought life into the bustling metropolis had been diverted long ago, and all that remains is a dried out ditch filled with the bodies of victims of hunger and thirst. The raheni who once swelled the ranks of the Tiger Command in their fight for tolerance and acceptance under new masters have lost the will to fight on. There is little resistance as the true masters of Rahen, nay, Haless, march through the city, the march of steel greaves drowning out what few sounds of life remain.\n\nLed by the Lion Marshal, the kikun reaches the palace of the Tiger Marshal. [R67.Monarch.GetName], who once ruled much of Rahen through their legions of bureaucrats, currently commands little more than their palace, but even that is coming to an end. Following the raid of the palace those few guards with the will to fight died in battle with the rest being captured. Special care was taken to ensure the Marshal was captured and delivered to Sarilavhan.\n\nIn Sarilavhan [R67.Monarch.GetName] is taken before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] loyal Marshals. The Tiger Marshal is forced to kneel before the [Root.Monarch.GetName] as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] begins to speak.\n\n"You have sown disunity and turned clan against clan in your bid for freedom. You would shatter the empire of steel that hobgoblinkind has forged through war and sacrifice. There is no greater dishonour than to betray the efforts and lives of our brethren and ancestors who forged our Great Command."\n\nA lone sword is brought before [R67.Monarch.GetName] and their hands are unbound by the guards. [Root.Monarch.GetName] continues,"
 the_command.1994.a: ""Make your final choice.""

 the_command.1995.t: "The Elephant Slain"
 the_command.1995.d: "Cannons roar, bricks break, walls crumble, such is the nature of a siege. It was no easy feat to destroy the walls of [R68.Capital.GetCapitalName], it took thousands of hobgoblins manning hundreds of cannons, cutting supply lines and gathering intelligence to finally break the fortified city. The Wolf Marshal commands his troops to charge the breach as the defenders let out a rallying cry. The fighting over the city is brutal, xia masters and kai mercenaries lead by hobgoblin officers face off against endless regimens flying the three headed banner. The ringing of clashes of steel overtake the city as the battle engulfs and destroys everything in its wake. As the forces of the Great Command advance deeper into the city [R68.Monarch.GetName]  is seen fighting with techniques utilising cultivated chi. [R68.Monarch.GetName] fought fiercely, defeating multiple edan of soldiers before finally being subdued. Resistance in the city crumbles once [R68.Monarch.GetSheHe] is captured and the banner of the Great Command once again flies over [R68.Capital.GetCapitalName].\n\nBound in korashi chains, [R68.Monarch.GetName] is made to kneel before [Root.Monarch.GetName] in the very War Room this civil war originated from. [Root.Monarch.GetName] begins to speak.\n\n"Your disloyalty has threatened the very existence of the Great Command hobgoblinkind has forged through blood and steel. You have trampled upon the unity that forms our strength as a people, and have truly dishonoured yourself in this petty bid for freedom. Normally such great treachery would have you stripped of any and all rights..."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] gives a signal and a blade is brought before [R68.Monarch.GetName] and [R68.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands are unbound by a soldier behind [R68.Monarch.GetHerHim]. [Root.Monarch.GetName] finishes,"
 the_command.1995.a: ""However, I grant you one more choice than you have the right to.""

 the_command.1996.t: "The Fallen Dragon"
 the_command.1996.d: "Silence finally overtakes the battlefield around [R69.Capital.GetCapitalName] as the noise of the final cannon blast dies down. The great cannons of [R69.Capital.GetCapitalName], which once obliterated any attempts to take the capital sit atop the walls as little more than decoration. The Boar Marshal orders the kikun surrounding the city to bring the siege equipment into firing range to breach the walls. Without the support of their cannons the walls of [R69.Capital.GetCapitalName] fall quickly and the march into the city commences. Resistance within the city was non-conventional, traps using what little blackpowder remained in the city were used to cripple the soldiers as they flooded into the streets of [R69.Capital.GetCapitalName] as skirmishers harassed them from a distance. However a city of engineers and inventors cannot resist the might of a fully drilled hobgoblin kikun led by a Marshal and the city was soon overrun by a tide of soldiers. [R69.Monarch.GetName] was found in the university of [R69.Capital.GetCapitalName], organising resistance and experimenting with top engineers in the hopes of creating something that could repel the waves of soldiers. These efforts were ultimately futile as the remaining resistance was stamped out and [R69.Monarch.GetName] was captured along with the university.\n\n[R69.Monarch.GetName] is made to kneel before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] begins to speak.\n\n"Your talent and ambition have brought you to a greater station than any soldier of your age. Even the great Moguwon was thirty-five when he led our people out of the Jade Mines in our great campaign against the ruin kingdoms. Yet your ambition has festered into selfish aspirations of power and your talent was not enough to stand against the combined wills of our Great Command. You have not only wasted your own potential, but the potential of thousands of brave soldiers, engineers, farmers and artisans. Your gross transgression cannot be allowed to stand."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] pauses as a sword is placed in front of [R69.Monarch.GetName] and [R69.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands are unbound."
 the_command.1996.d.noriko: "In the end, even the might of the Dragon Command couldn’t stop Noriko from returning home. She led the final assault herself, striking through areas that had been overly reliant on the now-dormant cannons. Resistance within the city was unconventional, engineers and inventors resorting to blackpowder traps and backhanded ambush. Caught in the edge of one such blast, Noriko spat out blood onto the pavement. Kobold tactics.\n\nAfter much fighting, Hikari Dragonborn was captured alongside the [R69.Capital.GetCapitalName] university, and made to kneel before her mother. Blood-soaked and stormy-eyed, the younger Dragonborn stared up at Noriko, almost indignant. An assistant planted his boot on Hikari’s head and bent that proud neck. "Look down, traitor! The Grand Marshal speaks!"\n\nNoriko raised a calm hand, and the boot was lifted. Her face was impassive, bearing none of the furor she’d shown earlier. "Hikari Dragonborn. Your talent and ambition have brought you to a greater station than any other soldier of your age. Even the great—"\n\n"I killed him." Hikari’s voice echoed against the vaulted ceiling of the university. "Anbi, your handpicked successor. I killed him, because I knew you would never have let me succeed you. Even though I deserved it. Even though I’d earned it." Her voice hissed, low and slow, as she turned her face skywards towards her mother once more.\n\nNoriko choked, stumbling as though pierced by an arquebus. "You—no. You were only twenty-one! Even if you were skilled, what mother would I be to impose such responsibilities on my child?" The mask of impassivity was gone now, replaced by a grimace of anguish—at herself, for Hikari, for Anbi. "Oh, Hikari. You don’t understand. I never wanted this for you." The tears fell now, hard and fast.\n\nHikari dropped her face down towards the stone floor, dark hair spilling out around her to hide her expression. Beside her, the assistant handed her a sword and unbound her wrists. It was then that Hikari laughed, a sullen and hollow thing."
 the_command.1996.a: ""It is rare for someone of your age to be granted this choice. Use it wisely.""
 the_command.1996.b: ""No. I don’t suppose I will ever understand.""

 the_command.1983.t: "The Demon Exorcised"
 the_command.1983.d: "In the end, the Shirgrii feels almost simple to assault. Hewn stone structures, built into the side of a mountain, fall to the roar of cannonfire and the charge of a few edan. The journey to get here, however, has been anything but easy. The mists of the Demon Hills obscure both path and person, hiding the Oni base of operations deep within its smothering embrace. Both Aingjada and Oni alike use it as cover to launch relentless guerrilla attacks at the Ninyu Kikun, before retreating here to the safety of the Shirgrii.\n\nThe monks inside the temple offer stiff resistance, crushing hobgoblin lamellar with their ancient kanugarl weapons. The unshackling of the Basfurji, the Punished Oni, presents an unexpected counterattack. More than one Aingjada chooses to make the ultimate sacrifice, diving into a hobgoblin edan with explosive fireworks strapped to their body. Rarely do they make a dent in the numbers.\n\nFinally, the fighting stops, and the silence of the mists falls once more over the hills. [Y01.Monarch.GetTitle] [Y01.Monarch.GetName] [Y01.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is bound in Korashi and brought before Grand Marshal [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]. The Oni holds [Y01.Monarch.GetHerHis] head up high, proud even when reduced once more into servitude.\n\nThe Grand Marshal does not speak. What use is there in speaking to a slave? Instead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gives a wave of the hand to an assistant, who unsheathes a gleaming blade. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] turns to walk away, the [Y01.Monarch.GetTitle] instead opens [Y01.Monarch.GetHerHis] mouth.\n\n"Jaher, Harimar, greater kings than you have tried to claim the Demon Hills. And yet we remain, unconquered. We were here before you came, little goblin. We will be here when you go."\n\nThe assistant merely raises the sword high overhead. For the first time, the [Y01.Monarch.GetTitle] looks down, unwilling to see the end that approaches. But [Y01.Monarch.GetSheHe] does make one final comment, whispered quietly to no one in particular:"

 the_command.1997.t: "A Letter from the Jademarch"
 the_command.1997.d: "The typical hustle and bustle of the War Room is interrupted by a rather short messenger. Goblins are a rare sight outside of the Jademines, yet even rarer is one present in the halls of the War Room typically reserved for hobgoblin generals. The crooked-nosed fellow swiftly announced his presence and delivered a letter to the Grand Marshal’s feet.\n\n"The Marcher Goblins appreciate your kindness in allowing us the luxury of our homeland, the Jade Mines. However, in recent years we have been having money troubles and require less oversight to continue operations. Unfortunately, we must request the swift renegotiation of our contract.\n\nSigned, [R81.Monarch.GetTitle] [R81.Monarch.GetName]."\n\nGiven the current circumstances, this is nothing more than extortion, yet what can we truly do?"

 the_command.2020.t: "Unmet Quotas"
 the_command.2020.d: "Unfortunate news from the Jade March. Ever since our disagreement with the marcher goblins the wealth of the Jade Mines seems to have dried up. The metals we receive from the mines have been steadily decreasing, to the point where even the minimum quotas aren’t being met. Any attempts to enforce the quota are met with endless diversions, delays and misdirection from the goblin administrators. As we cannot divert a large force to ensure that production in the mines picks up again, we will have to survive with fewer resources for now."
 the_command.2020.a: "Disorder strikes in the Jade Mines."

 the_command.2021.t: "Mithril Shortages"
 the_command.2021.d: "Foreboding news from the Jade March. Multiple mithril mines have collapsed, halting the flow of mithril for the foreseeable future. While there are efforts being made to restore the mines, they seem to be progressing much slower than anticipated. The sudden collapse of the mithril mines along with the dealayed restoration efforts have led some of our intelligence officers to suggest the possibility of the marcher goblins sabotaging our war efforts. While this argument is convincing, accusing the Jade March of sabotage would damage our already strained relations, possibly to the point of open revolt. We will have to fight even without the pride of our blacksmiths."
 the_command.2021.a: "What are those goblins plotting?"

 the_command.2022.t: "Production Surplus"
 the_command.2022.d: "Good news from the Jade March. Rapports show that the metal extraction of the Jade Mines has been well above quota lately. Whether it is due to good fortune or war enthusiasm from the recently elevated marcher goblins, these metals will be a great boon to the war effort. Forges across the Great Command are producing weapons, armour and other goods at a far greater pace than before."
 the_command.2022.a: "The product of an honorable partnership."

 the_command.2023.t: "Mithril Surplus"
 the_command.2023.d: "Exciting news from the Jade March. A new vein of mithril has been uncovered in the Jade Mines and new mines are being set up to exploit this windfall. This vast deposit of mithril will enable the great forge of Sarilahvan to produce even greater quantities of mithril equipment at an even greater quality than before. The access to mithril weaponry and armour will serve as a great boon over the betrayers, who only possess modest at best reserves of mithril."
 the_command.2023.a: "Jade mithril with dominate the battlefield!"

 the_command.1998.t: "A Lost Jewel"
 the_command.1998.d: "Days have passed, and our allies beneath the mountain have proved sincere in their supposed goodwill towards the Great Command. The status quo is tenable, but we cannot overlook the transgression of lashing out at their masters in our time of weakness. It makes little difference whether they have mended the diplomatic rift, for mere property should never be allowed to oversee its own affairs. Perhaps it is time for us to propose yet another ‘renegotiation’ to the contract."

 the_command.2000.t: "Oni Subterfuge"
 the_command.2000.d: "Ever since they escaped our grasp the treacherous oni have been seeking to undermine us at every turn during our moment of weakness; their agents and diviners constantly prying for information to sell to the disloyal commands. These constant attempts at subterfuge have stretched our own counterespionage capabilities thin and with the latest development, severely damaged them. The oni recently succeeded in assassinating one of our high level agents, causing chaos within our already strained espionage agency. This has crippled our ability to detect spies amongst our midst for the foreseeable future."

 the_command.2003.d: "Often referred to as the Rebellious Child of Rahen, the city of Sir has long since been a hotbed for revolts. It is no exaggeration to say that one of our most strenuous jobs has been ensuring that the Kingdom of Sir was buried beneath a mountain of blood and time, yet all of this work has swiftly faded away in the wake of the city’s new occupiers.\n\nThe crown jewel of our early campaigns has been wrenched from our grasp, with local resistance being swiftly and systematically crushed amidst the burning city and its peripheries. History has been written, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become the Grand Marshal that let [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] city fall."
 the_command.2003.a: "Do they only seek to fan the flames of chaos?"

 the_command.2004.t: "The Fall of Sarilavhan"
 the_command.2004.d: "The long and arduous siege of the great Warcamp of Sarilavhan has reached its end, but perhaps more worrying than a criminal ransacking is a peaceful march into a fallen city. Despite making entry under the cover of the new moon, no torches lit their way, and no men-at-arms stood in their path. Such is the fate of a war between brothers and sisters–courtesy is simply the result of these new circumstances we find ourselves in. The gates of Sarilavhan now fly the banners of the Tiger, Elephant, and Dragon with merriment and commerce abound."
 the_command.2004.a: "It is unthinkable to think our people’s loyalty was so thin."

 the_command.2005.t: "Half-Orc Mercenaries"
 the_command.2005.d: "While most wuhyun half-orcs serve within the regular military structure of the Command some have chosen the dishonourable life of a mercenary. Some of these mercenaries, whether motivated by true patriotic feeling or lust for personal glory, have offered to join the Ninyu Kikun, the Grand Marshal’s personal army. While we are in dire need of manpower, accepting mercenaries into our ranks would be seen as a sign of weakness from the Grand Marshal."
 the_command.2005.a: "We welcome these new recruits."

 the_command.2010.d: "The marching of boots. The beating of drums. The howling of horns. These are the sounds that fill the air in Sarilavhan on this triumphant day. The three headed banner is waving proudly from every building in the sprawling city as the smell of meat being prepared for a great waft through the streets. The buzz of the central square dies down as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches the podium to address the crowd, the sun shining down upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\n'No longer shall we fight against our kin! The Tiger, Elephant and Dragon Marshals have been crushed, our Great Command is whole again! Our nation has always been strong in body, but the Great Insubordination showed the division within the mind of our Great Command. We have suffered greatly and lost much, yet our nation has been tempered by hardship. Now we are a nation both strong in body and united in purpose, where we were once steel forged we are now mithril forged! Some may think that this is the time for peace and recovery, they forget that our enemies beyond our borders will not wait for our rejuvenation. While we have been fighting amongst ourselves our opponents have been preparing to attack us in our moment of weakness. There is no time for peace, we must march against our enemies lest they forget who the true masters of Haless are. Let the Great Campaign continue!'\n\nThe crowd erupts into jingoism as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] mounts [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] warg and leads the marching kikun out of the city. The Great Command is reforged through blood and all of Haless trembles before its might."
 the_command.2010.d.2: "On wings of desperation we flew ever so high into the sky that we craved to live and breathe beneath for eons. That blue cavern ceiling that never ends, with winds guiding the soul of our people south, into the open plains of Rahen. We flew ever so high, yearning to be closer to the beautiful sun that turned its back on us centuries ago. Yet that sun did melt our wings, and we     were turned away from the paradise ahead. We flew ever so far, sent forth by never-ending gusts of fresh air, towards the bountiful hills and fields that our ancestors promised our children. Yet so too did the winds betray us, leading our souls astray and leaving our hearts behind.\n\nIt was a crime to dream of that which cannot be conquered: that endless sky belongs to no one, these blowing breezes know no master."
