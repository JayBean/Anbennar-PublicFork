They behave as the combination of a military order and an inquisition, seeking out traitors to the nation and then crushing them utterly. They trust only in their masters, the Archdevils Kazraiel and Mesner."

 esmaryal_order_desc:0 "While the vast majority of the Esmaryal temples sided with Adean (after all, he is her son), a small sect of venerable and influential priestesses saw Corin as a new daughter to guide, and sought to use their years of wisdom to truly mold a worthy heir for the Regent Court. Of course, these heretics, branded as Dowagers, were banished from Esmaria, but eventually found home advising the new age of adventurer kings who flocked to Corin's banner. "

 nerat_order_desc:0 "Named after the priest who helped deify Corin, Dominic of Gallowspeak, these grim knights instill a fear of justice and law to even Corin's faithful.

 ara_order_desc:0 "There has long been a divide between the urban and rural Aranite priests, and when Corin's word spread many of the poorer countryside clergy saw a banner to finally challenge their richer counterparts. To them they had corrupted Ara into a face that justified greed, promoting things such as speculation and worse, gambling. This movement soon grew into the Guild of Good Merchants, who created their own communes which abandoned coin for bartering and where material wealth was shared."

But Corin has showed a new generation of Ryalan priestesses that the old ways are but divine chains meant to subjugate. Now, a new sisterhood has risen, a secret network of women across Cannor once thought docile, using their newfound connections to open routes, opportunities and wealth to once another afforded only women are united, not divided.

 balgar_order_desc:0 "The Greentide was seen as a holy war for the Balgarites to reclaim the Dragonforge, the vast foundry-temple that Balgar himself built that fueled the war machine that was Castanor. Now as Corin's liberation frees Escann, the Balgarites with them have assumed their place as principal authority amongst Balgar's temples. No longer should their clerics focus on grand architectures and artisan works, no, their word echoes that of the days of old: that their forges are the backbone upon which empires are made, the flames that temper the blade of justice, and the steel that reinforces the bulwark of faith."

 corin_order_desc:0 "The one thing that Corin's faithful had over others was numbers, for amongst her faithful the duties of faith once relegated to trained priests fall to every man, woman and child.

 nathalyne_order_desc:0 ""There can be no light without shadow" or so these Corinites say. The House of Light seeks to be other side of the flaming torch of Corinite zeal, making sure that as the firebrands lead way with sword and shield, that there is a dagger to deal with cravens and cowards who escape Corin's wroth. Indeed, slavery is one such abomination."

They do not see Dookan as an evil force, but a god of Strength and Mercenaries that toppled the decadent Court and allowed the righteous and stronger Corinism to rise in its place. The Broken Tusk Brotherhood takes the weak and teaches them to become strong without any distinction; after all, what is the best way to protect someone but to teach him how to protect himself?"
