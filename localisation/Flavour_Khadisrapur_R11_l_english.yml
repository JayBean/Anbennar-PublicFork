 flavour_khadisrapur_1.t:0 "The Return of Himmat the Hero"
 flavour_khadisrapur_1.d:0 "During the apex of the hobgoblin invasion in 1434, a number of nobles revolted against the ruling Jamma II Pirvand, rising in support of crown prince Balkevir Pirvand. The younger son of Jamma II, Balke became crown prince when his older brother, Himmat, relinquished his claims to the throne and chose the life of an adventurer.  The young Balke was concerned by his aging father's reluctance to aid the faltering kingdom of Raghajandi, whose king was his wife's father. But Balke did not have the support of the army, which remained fiercely loyal to Jamma, and so he, his wife, and their supporters were defeated and sentenced to exile. In this way did Jamma II lose both of his sons.\n\nThat was a decade ago, and Khadisrapur has endured much in these ten long years. Now, though, the elder scion of the royal family has returned. The long-lost Himmat Pirvand has made his way to his father's court and now kneels before his father's throne to offer his services to his ailing fatherland. He is not alone; accompanying Himmat are the many mercenaries and adventurers he befriended in his travels. The man has changed - gone is the flamboyant firestarter, eager to prove himself. Instead, Himmat is now an experienced veteran and a hero of the people. He comes with radical ideas to modernize the military and has only one condition for his aid - that his younger brother be allowed to return to fight by his side."

 flavour_khadisrapur_2.d:0 "The voice echoed across the battlefield "... Soldiers, Heroes, Die for your land! Your lives are gone, erased by The Command!" Himmat, once blackguard and now hero, shouts, rallying his troops for a final assault on the Boar command's fortified positions. The battle was fierce, for the hobgoblin brutes were as ferocious as they were efficient. But the men of Khadisrapur die not to a single arrow, or two - they fight for blood and redemption, and so they rallied behind their long-lost prince. "Until your last dying breath!" he said. The monsters did not expect such determination and morale from a hopeless, ruined kingdom.\n\nWhen the battle ended, Prince Himmat yet stood. Legend has it that some of his wounded men refused to die before they saluted him one last time at the battle's conclusion. And a Hero of Khadisrapur was declared, Himmat, the first of his name, The Hero-Prince of Khadisrapur and savior of the people. His younger brother, Balke, standing by his side on the battlefield, was the first to congratulate him."

 flavour_khadisrapur_3.t:0 "The Reconquest of Raghajandi"
 flavour_khadisrapur_3.d:0 "With Sarilavhan in our hands, the time has come to address the matter of our claims on Raghajandi lands. What is left of the original inhabitants of Sarilavhan and its inhabitants speak the same dialect and tongue that the people in Khadisrapur do, they serve the same dishes when at a traditional wedding, and wear the same type of caps that we do. Today we can change history by integrating these Khedarid peoples into their true Kingdom, that of Khadisrapur, that of their own peoples, friends, and liberators.\n\nThere are, however, suspicious eyes looking at our parading soldiers with a sour taste in their tongues; we are the liberators, that much is clear, but these people had their own realm, their own Kingdom... before it fell to disaster. Maybe they feel as though we are taking advantage of our status and their graciousness towards us?\n\nPrince Balke, a controversial but undeniably loyal soul to the cause, holds a legitimate claim to the lands of Sarilavhan and its surroundings through the inheritance of his wife, one of the last surviving royals of the Kingdom of Raghajandi. And the people seem to have taken a liking to his policies as a provisional governor in the area. We can cede the lands to him for a short time and win the hearts of the people in that regard.\n\nIt now falls to us to decide what to do with these lands, should we incorporate them into the realm proper or let them have autonomy over their lands?"
