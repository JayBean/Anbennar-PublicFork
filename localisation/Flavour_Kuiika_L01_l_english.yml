 L01_the_port_of_bud_vanhu_title:0 "The Port of Bud Vanhu"
 L01_the_port_of_bud_vanhu_desc:0 "Kuiika has not had access to the Sea of Lel in centuries. We have commandeered many ships from Zena, but our pitiful fleet could never match Zuvavim, let alone the Vyzemby. Start building ships at the port of Bud Vanhu. Our ambitions demand it."
 L01_take_the_ananoma_title:0 "Take the Ananoma"
 L01_take_the_ananoma_desc:0 "Dotted along the Horashesh coast lie the old Vyzemby forts: the Ananoma. Long ago the halfling city states used these locations to control trade on the Sea of Lel. The forts themselves may have crumbled, but the Vyzemby knew what they were doing. These locations are perfect to project power navally and dominate the Horashesh coast."
 L01_this_is_not_vyzemby_land_title:0 "This is not Vyzemby Land"
 L01_this_is_not_vyzemby_land_desc:0 "We bear no ill will towards the halflings that live in our land. The halflings across the sea in Fahvanosy, on the other hand, worry us with their talk of “reclaiming” the mainland. They use the Ananoma as evidence for their claims: tear them down this instant. This is Vurebindu land now, as it has been for over two thousand years. We will not allow such farcical claims to remain uncontested."
 L01_war_for_zena_ii_title:0 "War for Zena II"
 L01_war_for_zena_ii_desc:0 "Bivuzena should have been ours. In the War for Zena, our people bled so much, and yet triumphed so magnificently. But when it came time for us to take Zena’s capital, our so-called allies panicked. Iqhekabi and Zuvavim faced barely any resistance in their subjugation of Chibuswa, and yet they demanded we leave Bivuzena alone. We would have marched in regardless, but our brave soldiers were tired, and we could not risk an all-out war with those two traitors.\n\nNow though? We have no such fear. Our army is stronger than ever. It’s time to take what is rightfully ours."
 L01_kheteratan_refugees_title:0 "Kheteratan Refugees"
 L01_kheteratan_refugees_desc:0 "Kheterata’s collapse gave us a rare opportunity to unite Horashesh under our banner, rather than under the thumb of those in Kheterat. It would be easy to crow at the Kheteratan refugees fleeing conflict, but we must refrain from doing so. The Medawor would be most upset if we denied their relatives from the Sorrow refuge in our nation. Our animosity lies not towards the Kheteratan people, but towards the old and decrepit empire of Kheterata itself. We are building something Kheterata could never have dreamed of. We will accept the help of anyone who believes in our project, khetist or otherwise."
 L01_we_will_unite_horashesh_title:0 "We Will Unite Horashesh"
 L01_we_will_unite_horashesh_desc:0 "The War for Zena was a cause of great anguish to our people. Beset on both sides by invaders from Gomuvuri and Zena, we pressed every available man into combat to defend the homeland. That we weren’t wiped from the map is incredible. That we took the coast from Zena was a miracle worthy of Kui himself.\n\nYet it is not enough for our ambitions. It is clear to our Medaka, wise beyond his years, that if we are to ensure a united Horashesh in the future, we need an army capable of accomplishing feats far greater than those of our brave yet untrained army of peasants. Send word to every merchant, noble, and whomever else has coin. Invest in the future of Kuiika, for we will be the first nation in history to finally unite Horashesh under its own banner!"
 L01_fund_our_expansion_title:0 "Fund Our Expansion"
 L01_fund_our_expansion_desc:0 "Awkward questions have begun to issue from our Medaka’s advisors. While Efergezmu and Medawor alike stand behind the goal of uniting Horashesh, they want to know when we will start selling instead of merely borrowing. Our own merchants aren’t using our currency, instead trading in old defunct Kheteratan coinage.\n\nWe have come up with two solutions. The first is to secure the mine of Golonela and use its seemingly endless supply of gold to mint our own, new coins. The second is to take the confluence at Foloyman and the beadware workshops for which the town is so famous, so we can profit from their craftsmanship."
 L01_legions_of_kui_title:0 "The Legions of Kui"
 L01_legions_of_kui_desc:0 "Kui’s greatest accomplishment was the speed with which he turned a mob of Vurebindu peasants into a fighting force capable of taking on the mighty warriors of the Irsukuba Federation. Our latest batch of warriors would lose in battle to an injured gazelle, let alone a great Irsukuba warrior. Take inspiration from Kui and work these new warriors until each one could duel a lion bare-handed. Then we will know we have a force worthy of reclaiming the title as the Legions of Kui."
 L01_they_doubted_the_project_title:0 "They Doubted the Project"
 L01_they_doubted_the_project_desc:0 ""And what will you do when these rich men hire every mercenary in Sarhal to collect their payment?"" said the doubters. "Do you plan to auction off the Kuiika Gamyi to pay our debts?"\n\nTo think they doubted us. Fools."
 L01_kuis_kingdom_title:0 "Kui's Kingdom"
 L01_kuis_kingdom_desc:0 "The rolling landscape of the Horashesh Plains lies before us. Every nation who stood in our way during the War for Zena has been crushed. We have lived up to the legacy of Kui and rebuilt the Kingdom he once did, if not to even greater heights than those he accomplished.\n\nKui’s Kingdom is here. Only one question remains: Who shall rule it?"
 L01_kuis_declaration_title:0 "Kui's Declaration"
 L01_kuis_declaration_desc:0 "When Kui stood beneath the spire at Gamyi and declared himself to be divine, the great spire responded to his words, and lit up like a clear and wondrous night sky. It remains a site of inspiration for all who wish to live up to his deeds. Our Medaka should address the crowds at the Kuiika Gamyi. Perhaps we can recruit more warriors to our cause."
 L01_the_tale_of_kui_title:0 "The Tale of Kui"
 L01_the_tale_of_kui_desc:0 "To understand Kui’s story, one must first understand the status the Vurebindu people had in the centuries before. The Irsukuba made us second-class citizens, disallowed from holding titles. The Fangaulan Empire saw us as merely land to be conquered. To speak of how we suffered under the Karassian Empire would make our audience queasy.\n\nIt was Kui who stood up and led us. He was the one who rallied the populace to his cause. He struck down the Irsukuba interlopers and built us a new home around Lake Kuiziva. He is the father of our people, and this lake is his gift to us."
 L01_trust_in_the_state_title:0 "Trust in the State"
 L01_trust_in_the_state_desc:0 "Our cause has widespread support amongst both the Medawor ruling class and the military. Yet the many nobles who make up the Efergezmu have been reporting that their subjects are unhappy. Heavy taxes on grain and cattle to feed our armies have weighed heavily on them. Tax collectors have been attacked, with farmers convinced all their food is merely going to make the Medawor fat. We must assuage their concerns and show them that their sacrifices are for a great cause."
 L01_the_kuiika_gamyi_title:0 "The Kuiika Gamyi"
 L01_the_kuiika_gamyi_desc:0 "What is the Kuiika Gamyi? It is so clearly not of this world, towering over everything in sight. Giraffes look like ants next to it. Our Griots have a tale that it was placed by the great god Zuvanofa himself. Like a sewing pin, he placed it at Lake Kuiziva when he laid down the continents. When he attempted to remove it, he accidentally snapped the top off, and it got stuck in place, which explains the jagged top of the spire.\n\nZuvanofa left it at Lake Kuiziva, deciding instead to use it as a conduit to send messages to the people of Noukahi. His messages are rare, but when the spire lights up, we know a new legend has been born."
 L01_undermine_the_dragon_title:0 "Undermine the Dragon"
 L01_undermine_the_dragon_desc:0 "In the War for Zena, we had Gomuvuri in our grasp. The forces of Zena had retreated and our warriors were starting their march into their jungles. Yet at the last moment, we received a letter from the old Kheteratan fortress at Aramoole: Gomuvuri is under our protection. Leave now or face the wrath of the Bronze Dragon.\n\nWe should have continued. We could have continued. But our generals were scared. Rumours had circled for years that a dragon was hiding in the fortress of Aramoole, and these stories spooked the men. We cannot allow these fear-mongering stories to keep us from uniting the Kuivanhi people. Show that we are superior to those dragon worshippers and that Gomuvuri would be safer under our protection."
 L01_tarnished_bronze_title:0 "Tarnished Bronze"
 L01_tarnished_bronze_desc:0 "The Noukahi Pantheon is a faith of heroes. New tales are spun every day. Heroic feats are turned into tales, then spread by the griots to every corner of Horashesh. The latest tale gripping the people is how the great soldiers of Kuiika ended the reign of a mighty dragon and drove its followers out of the mountains. It is called The Tale of Tarnished Bronze."

 flavor_kuiika.1.t:0 "Rebuild the Army"
 flavor_kuiika.1.d:0 "The War for Zena proved two things. The first is that we can unite Horashesh. The second is that, if we are to unite Horashesh, we need an army. We need not just every warrior to dust off his shield and grab his dulled spear in the name of Kui. No, we need to invest in our soldiers. We need iron. We need training. We need a professional fighting force.\n\nSend out the word to every man of means. Never again shall Horashesh fall under the thumb of a foreign empire. Horashesh shall be united beneath our banner. Lend us your aid and I promise you all, your investment shall be rewarded."
 flavor_kuiika.1.a:0 "Invest in Kuiika"

 flavor_kuiika.2.t:0 "Kui's Legacy"
 flavor_kuiika.2.d:0 "Our imperial declaration may have our neighbours looking on in fear, but it has inspired countless men to travel to Gamyi to aid in our cause. What they lack in martial training they make up for in enthusiasm. We could hand them their spear and shield right now, or we could use their hands to build a great new military training camp, so that their sons will be the backbone of our armies."

 flavor_kuiika.3.t:0 "The Warriors of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_kuiika.3.d:0 "One person dancing is an act of freedom. A woman dancing by firelight does not need a routine to enjoy herself. As soon as you add a second person, though, you need discipline. You need to know what your partner is doing to truly dance together. Add a third, or a fourth, or a fifth person, and the dance becomes more complex, and each dancer needs to know what the others are doing. Add ten thousand dancers though…\n\nYou caught a glimpse of the terrified expression of the neighbouring nation’s diplomat, who you had invited to watch this dance. Every synchronised warcry made him flinch. The smashing of ten thousand shields and spears at once. The ground shook when the ten thousand soldiers jumped simultaneously.\n\nThis whirring of feathers, fur, and iron was billed as a dance, but everyone present knew what it was. It was a declaration: nobody in Sarhal can match this army."

 flavor_kuiika.4.t:0 "A Khetist Kuiika"
 flavor_kuiika.4.d:0 "To all my fellow Medawor. Kheterata has failed us. They believed sending a lone governor to Horashesh could somehow turn this region Khetist. For such a legendary empire, they were clearly run by incompetent baboons. Where they failed, we succeeded. With our backing, we turned these Vurebindu peasants into a force not just worthy of their local heroes, but of Elikhet himself!\n\nWe shall build a new Kheterata here in Horashesh. A better Kheterata. A stronger Kheterata. Each Horashesh peasant shall soon be exemplar Kheteratans, putting those who live along the Sorrow to shame. We shall build Kartakhet, and prove we are the ones to be not just Stewards of the Sorrow, but Stewards of all of Sarhal!"

 flavor_kuiika.5.t:0 "Horashesh for the Horasheshi"
 flavor_kuiika.5.d:0 "To all my fellow Efergezmu. Horashesh has never been united. In the days of yore we were slaves to the genies. The Karassian Empire pushed our forefathers to the brink of death in their scaly conquests. The Fangaulan Empire saw us as little more as clay to be coloured on a map. Kheterata demanded tribute from us, draining our lands and milking us until we could give no more.\n\nI am here to announce that, as of today, this has ended. No foreign power shall subjugate us again. No cat worshippers shall force their will on us again. No lizards, no khetists, nobody shall take these lands away from us. From this day forward, Horashesh will be free!"

 flavor_kuiika.6.t:0 "Subjugating Gomuvuri"
 flavor_kuiika.6.d:0 "The first guard was stabbed through the chest, the end of the spear piercing his torso and jutting from his back. The second guard had the sharp point at the top of a shield jammed under his chin, blood pouring from his wounds and dying red the zebra hide stretched across the shield’s face. The remaining guards threw down their weapons and pleaded for mercy. The Medaka of Gomuvuri scrambled backwards across the floor, trying to back away as the Kuiikan general strode towards him, spear pointed directly at the Medaka’s forehead. He started pleading to gods under his breath, alternating between Zuvanofa, Nirakhet, Kui, and even Aakhet, right up until the tip of the spear stopped millimetres from his face.\n\nAt that moment, the general laughed, and dropped his spear. "Why do you cower in fear [L12.Monarch.GetName]? Are you not a fellow Kuivanhi like I?" He bent down and offered an outstretched hand, a smile stretching across his face."
