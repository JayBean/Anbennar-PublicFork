 pomentere_estates_title:0 "Pomentere Estates"
 pomentere_estates_desc:0 "We have long employed various warriors, adventurers, and fortune seekers in our armies as Pomentere, to supplement our trueborn Ynnic sons. Now that the Veykodan Guard is the core of our army, we need to ensure that we can always have a good stock of Veykodan warriors to recruit. We will grant veterans of our wars estates in the new lands we reconquer, where they can prosper within Ynnic society."
 buycev_policy_title:0 "Buycev Policy"
 buycev_policy_desc:0 "Our policy of employing Veykodan Buycev, while largely successful in allowing us to rein in the petty lords who have claimed to rule our lands, has seen Veykodan power grow substantially, and should we not control and reward them adequately, we run the risk of losing all our gains. By ensuring constant victories in which we can hand out the spoils of wealth, we can make sure they don’t turn against us."
 veykodan_guard_title:0 "Veykodan Guard"
 veykodan_guard_desc:0 "So far, our recruits have been made up of strong, individual warriors seeking to make a name for themselves by fighting for the righteous Ynnic emperors. However, our recent successes have left us with vast lands no longer controlled by petty lords. We will hand these out to Veykodan veterans and families, encourage them to adopt our faith and create families to ensure that the next generations of emperor have a loyal and capable Veykodan Guard."
 thromshana_rangers_title:0 "Thromshana Rangers"
 thromshana_rangers_desc:0 "The Tromseloc Way has been cleared of threats and slowly the number of outposts and forts has grown, some even turning into villages who make a living from servicing the ever increasing number of travellers and merchants.\n\nHowever, there are still reports of raids, of slaughtered remains along the way, no doubt the work of the last few straggling wendigos. Knights have for centuries formed the solution to beastly problems along the Ynn, but lest their power grow even more, let us turn instead to an even older tradition: rangers, patrolling the land for any signs of trouble, ready to hunt down even the scariest beasts.\n\nThe Tromseloc Way will receive a formal and organised force of rangers, based in nearby Thromshana. The Thromshana Rangers will make use of the finest steeds of the Thromshana ranch, a specialised smaller breed excellent for the roughlands the Tromseloc Way winds through."

 along_the_tromseloc_way_desc:0 "Now that the Tromseloc Way has been reopened, we have the opportunity to strike Dolindha from the east of the Ynn river, and reclaim the Throm Bacar, the Great Ynnic Dam of the east, where the floating town of Bosancovac has sprung as a haven from the mainland. Seizing it will not be easy, but we have the element of surprise on our side.\n\nOnce this vital crossing is secured, all of Dolindha will be within reach of reclamation, and not even the Bridge Wardens can stop us from doing so!"
 the_blood_of_lukaus_title:0 "Rescue the Old Capital"
 the_blood_of_lukaus_desc:0 "The Dolindhans were the first to unite the Ynnics into one empire, and it was Vareynn who first united the Dolindhans. Now, Vareynn stands as a testament to the tragedy of the dark ages.\n\nReduced to a mere town, it is not even the true capital of its own state: that honour goes to the castle of Vareynn Amac in its countryside, while the imperial capital with its wide streets and its arched pathways and its half-finished hippodrome is left to decay when not outright pillaged for stone. We did what Vareynn’s petty lords could not, and now it is time to incorporate the original capital of the empire back into our realm."

 bulwark_of_the_east_desc:0 "Amacimst has stood as a bulwark against the Cursed Ones even since the invasion of 1154, and while we commend their efforts to protect the Ynn from those that would threaten it, these adventurers turned knights have no business running a realm of their own, and should once again serve the Empire."
 veykodan_rune_warriors_title:0 "Veykodan Rune Warriors"
 veykodan_rune_warriors_desc:0 "Our recent defeat dealt by the petty lord Alaran has highlighted the flaws in our army, and there are many. Our forces, once strong enough to defend the entire empire, now are barely able to man the walls of Arverynn and are more of a militia than a true army. The loss of the keep of Arvezl leaves few Ynnic knights under our command, the Thromshana Ranch alone being not nearly enough to raise a strong core to rebuild our army with.\n\nCarodin II has instead proposed a radical alternative, an army based around the Veykodans of the east. Their rune magic makes them formidable adversaries, and their exotic sabretooth and woolly rhino mounts are almost able to compete with the mighty antler horses. While we have always employed small bands of Veykodans here and there, it is time to make them a true part of our army."
 seize_the_imperial_palace_title:0 "Seize the Imperial Palace"
 seize_the_imperial_palace_desc:0 "In 674 emperor Darastarad I moved the imperial court to Stanyrhrada due to his love for the weather and countryside, where it stayed as the capital for two centuries. Its palace, once a beacon of our imperial might, has since been refitted into a castle which is the base of power of the yen Stantir, a cadet branch of the imperial dynasty.\n\nWhile we now rule from Arverynn and have no desire to move our court, they do not have the prestige of the Vyrekynn, and, should Stanyrhrada’s feudatories grow over-ambitious, their home would make a fantastic summer palace."
 guard_the_veykodan_approach_title:0 "The Veykodan Approach"
 guard_the_veykodan_approach_desc:0 "While many Veykodans travel west to seek employment under Ynnic lords, many more head west in warbands to loot and pillage our prosperous and well tended lands, showing the savage mindset that those far from the Ynn have.\n\nRaids from this region date all the way back to the times of Calrodiy the Great, who built Arverynn and Fadhevych as fortifications near the sites of his two biggest victories against Veykodan chieftains. While the first evolved into a city and the second into a castle, both keep acting as primary fortifications from which the approaches into Sarda are guarded; we should ensure that they are well kept and manned by fine soldiers, and we should not forget the keep of Arvezl inbetween."
 unity_of_the_sarda_title:0 "Unity of the Sarda"
 unity_of_the_sarda_desc:0 "By Strength we gave them Order, and our rule over Sarda was restored. Some of the more far-out lordlings in Selocshana and Vels Fadhecai may yet see it differently, but it is only a matter of time before they too are brought back into the imperial fold.\n\nSo let us rule: two centuries of petty lords and betrayals have left Sarda without purpose or loyalty, yet they could not undo the legacy of the Ynnic Empire, which merely needs to be re-learned. To facilitate this process, grand councils will be hosted, with banquets so sumptuous and performances so dazzling that even the haughtiest nobles will not miss out on them. In a decade or two under our reign, all of Sarda will surely see the Greatness of House Vyrekynn."
 march_on_mocvamsto_title:0 "March on Moc Bacar"
 march_on_mocvamsto_desc:0 "With Sarda behind our banner, it is time we finish what Emperor Varamel set out to do when he marched with his army onto the western lands towards Dolindha.\n\nThe knights of Arganjuzorn will be easily overcome by our numbers this time, while Moc Bacar, the Dam of the Swamp, or Mocbarja as it is known in the Dolindhan tongue, still proves an intimidating chokepoint for any army seeking an entrance into Dolindha's heartlands: it is the only one, in fact, ever since the Tromseloc Way collapsed to Wendigos, Buycev and bandits. If we are to reassert control over this region, the banners of the imperial house must fly over this entrypoint once more."
 vanquich_the_battlekings_title:0 "Vanquish the Battlekings"
 vanquich_the_battlekings_desc:0 "It is one thing to be upstarts, to forsake the Empire that nurtured you and protected you in favour of a new system of governance known as feudalism. It is pure madness however, to do what Lord Galadorn yen Ceped did, and launch a rebellion to restore a kingdom that exhausted its purpose over a millennium ago.\n\nMalacnar's new battlekings seek to upend the social order of the Ynn and value nothing but brute force, which fits more an apocalyptic wasteland than it does a proper empire. While we have often employed the Malacnar Battleguards and they have proven to be loyal and competent when paid well, the battlekingdom must be brought down and reincorporated into our empire."
 knights_of_the_bush_title:0 "Knights of the Bush"
 knights_of_the_bush_desc:0 "The Knights of the Bush have been steadfast defenders of the Ynn: not only do they guard the northern border against Old Rzentur clan-warriors who covet Ynnic lands, they have also organized the coalition that repelled the Drozma Tur invasion of 1367, leading to Drozmagog’s death and the final avenging of the Great Fire of Arverynn.\n\nThe Hedge Gardens of Grebniesth and their nobles’ flowery language stand out like a vibrant rose in the rugged thorn-bush that is Dolindha. Their style and grace would be a great addition to our court in the Teal Keep, but will do them no good against our rightful might."
 surge_beyond_the_dark_ages_title:0 "Surge Beyond the Dark Ages"
 surge_beyond_the_dark_ages_desc:0 "By right and might, our rule is restored. From Vysamsto the High City to Adbrabohvi by the edge of the world, the imperial banners of the Teal Crest and the Vermillion Steed fly in every city, if they can be truly called cities in the same vein as Arverynn.\n\nLike our beautiful Arverynn needed decades of love and care to flourish into the city it was before the Age of the Petty Lords, generations will pass before Vareynn and Vysamsto are to be truly called jewels. Greatness will have to wait for Order, as we continue the process of Strengthening our ties with our utmost loyal vassals, settling the matter of unitary policies for them all.\n\nBy the end of it, our power will be an insurmountable crashing wave, with the Strength to drown nations, but also birth new life and grow prosperity like never before. We will see an Empire reunited, a religion reformed, and a dynasty reinstated.\n\nIt is good to be Emperors."
 a_true_vyrekynn_title:0 "A True Vyrekynn"
 a_true_vyrekynn_desc:0 "Strength from Order. Order from Greatness.\n\nThose are the words of our house, and Carodin II is looking to embody our ideals perfectly. While Calrodiy IV brought hope and our Great dynasty back to this realm, and with it a semblance of Order, he also achieved little in the ways of Strength, his biggest "achievement" saving our city by nearly bankrupting our country with bribes to Alaran of Trompolere. Carodin II however, has magnificent plans with which we will start our reconquest of the empire. A True Vyrekynn, for the True Empire."
 defeat_the_rebellion_title:0 "Defeat the Rebellion"
 defeat_the_rebellion_desc:0 "The feeble Alaran may have made some initial gains with his band of bandits wielding flimsy arrows, but he is no match for our noble house backed by the full might of our reformed army with a core of Veykodans. Once we defeat Alaran, the petty lords that rule Horpanas and Arvezl will swear fealty to us once more, and our resurgence can begin."
 teach_them_a_lesson_title:0 "Teach them a Lesson"
 teach_them_a_lesson_desc:0 "Merely taking back our demesne is not enough. We need to show not just Trompolere, but all Sarda that any who oppose House Vyrekynn will be struck down with righteous fury. Set forth for the Vels Velenynn forest, and clear out any hideout bandits could use, including Trompolere's castle."
 rightful_rulers_of_sarda_title:0 "Rightful Rulers of Sarda"
 rightful_rulers_of_sarda_desc:0 "We are the rightful rulers of all the Ynn! But perhaps ensuring that the lords of Sarda are loyal first is wise. Once we rein in some initial fiefdoms, the rest will surely follow. Adbrabohvi especially favours our rule, praising our incorporation of Veykodans, and should we prove our might and legitimate rule, surely they will bow for us."
 arverynnic_rennaisance_title:0 "Arverynnic Renaissance"
 arverynnic_rennaisance_desc:0 "The Teal Keep stands as an impregnable fortress manned by imposing knights, steadfast soldiers, and devoted servants. Yet it used to be so much more: a resplendent house it was, where philosophers, artists and academics from all Ynn could gather for merriment as they honed their talent to let it improve the land.\n\nThe Emperor has already resolved to become one of the largest sponsors of patronage and several enterprising traders have followed this example. The court at the Teal Keep needs to experience a true rebirth if it is ever to become worthy of standing beside imperial Arverynn's pedestal, and not just in its shadow."

 relics_of_the_vyrekynn_desc:0 "House Vyrekynn, as great as it is and always will be, does not have a significant relic to gain prestige from, but no longer! As our Empire comes together, we become surrounded by many talented artists, smiths, and mages. Let us make the finest relic the world has ever seen!"
 subjugate_the_rzentur_title:0 "Subjugate the Rzentur"
 subjugate_the_rzentur_desc:0 "The Rzentur have abandoned our faith and now worship the dragon Varlengeilt. Previously known as Upper Dolindha, the region’s inhabitants have mingled with the Old Rzentur over the course of nine centuries to form a strange mix of barbarian and Ynnic cultures. The region rose up in rebellion during the Third Ynnic Civil War, led by the traitorous Lord Trantan, who was in turn overthrown by the Dragon Cult’s rebellion, and the rest is history.\n\nNow it is time to rein them back in, and turn them into loyal subjects of the Empire once more."

 towards_the_high_city_desc:0 "Vysamsto, or Svemel as it is commonly called today, was once a proud Ynnic city housing the faithful and loyal. Now, it is the center of a heretical faith worshipping dragons. This will not do, such an important city directly on the Ynn must once again become a loyal place of worship."
 resolve_our_debts_title:0 "Resolve Our Debts"
 resolve_our_debts_desc:0 "Arverynn’s treasury was already in a poor state when we had to resort to bribing Alaran of Trompolere. Much of the funds were raised from private citizens, and the Emperor exhausted every favour he had to scrounge up the money. Should we not manage to re-emerge from this financial quagmire, our militia will desert us and we will be forced to bow to a neighbouring lordling, assuming rabble-rousers don't get to us first…"
 centralized_bureaucracy_title:0 "Centralized Bureaucracy"
 centralized_bureaucracy_desc:0 "While in most of the Ynn the administration is performed by feudal lords helped by stewards and castellans, in Arverynn the imperial functionaries still diligently aid in the administration. Not only are they trained individuals, they are loyal to the crown, and not tied to the local lands. We should increase the number of functionaries and support them in their efforts to rein in local lords so that we can continue to administer more land directly."
 currency_reform_title:0 "Currency Reform"
 currency_reform_desc:0 "With the military victories of the Veykodan Guard and the political victories of the imperial functionaries, a great wealth is going to flow into our coffers in due time - but as of right now, they are drained dramatically. To combat this, we will enact a monetary reform, and turn to Vels Domfan: its Green-Gold Mint is within our grasp, and the coins it produces, being made of a glass encasing and a thin strip of gold, would be the Empire's perfect currency, beautiful and cheap in materials."
 land_reform_title:0 "Land Reform"
 land_reform_desc:0 ""General Rolatan spoke to the Assembly, bold in his triumph over the Cursed Ones. He proposed that the new land east of Vareynn be distributed one third to Vareynn's lower classes, one sixth to Stantirshalan nobles and to Bostynn's archers each, and the final third to Vareynn's King and his riders.\n\nGeneral Varamit became furious, accusing Rolatan of being a Cursed One sympathizer for giving so little land to the true victors of the campaign. Rolatan retracted, increasing the Riders' land share to half. This was seen as a bribe attempt and the Assembly was now calling for Rolatan's trial. Only when King Ivranvit stood up and spoke, they were persuaded to end their line of accusation. This was the first and last time in Ynnic history where the topic of land reform didn't result in bloodshed."\n\n-Civil War, Telnik yen Mocvas, Ynnic Historian, 627"
 vyrisamsto_title:0 "Vyrisamsto"
 vyrisamsto_desc:0 "There is once again a flourishing imperial capital in the Ynn! Sorrow over a past era is fading from these streets, as beaming decorations are draped from our houses and verdant walkways sway over the waves of visitors below: enterprising traders, perusing dignitaries, carefree townsfolk with their children, and a new generation of artists.\n\nIn the day you can purchase cranberries from Stenurynn and cloth from Lukausta, hire the services of hedge knights from Grebniesth and runic mercenaries from Vathres, and hear hammers crash and pulleys turn as southern stone is lifted to build more and more districts.\n\nFrom the height of the Teal Keep, the Emperor looks upon this domain and wonders: has the City of Emperors returned? Are we rising closer and closer to that pedestal?"

 foreigners_at_the_gates_desc:0 "Astounding news come from Adbrabohvi, about a previously-unknown civilization who has recently made contact. They have arrived from the Southern Cliffs by building elevators, and immediately have taken to trading bringing carriages full of goods - not only that, groups of them even invaded Epednar and Veykodan territory to make their homes there.\n\nMany have an irreverent attitude, looking to spread their heathen religions to Sarda by word if not by the sword - on the other hand, if a civilization is to be measured by the things it can build, then surely these Krarhnorians are making a good first impression…"

 pansvovych_desc:0 "Krarhnorian encroachment, while a threat to our stability, presents an opportunity like never before. For centuries, Ynnic emperors laboured to bring the Veykodan Overlands into our Empire, attempting to establish a Pansvovych - Lordship of the East - that would bring our borders to the Southern Cliffs and the Eastern Mountains.\n\nHearing about the new states and households forming in our frontier, many of our courtiers have started whispering dreams of eastward expansion once again. Will these Krarhnorians willingly join our fold, letting the Emperor shepherd them and guard the borders of their pastures? Will they endure a hundred military campaigns, protecting their far-out towns and beautiful forest lodges with a rifle in every bush?\n\nYnn River watch us, for whether by Strength or Greatness, we are going to bring Order to Veykoda!"

 dominate_the_tributaries_desc:0 "By the Ynn River, we have done it. Veykoda, the eastern overland enveloped by mist, home of tigers, wyrms and wooly rhinos, has finally been tamed. The tenacity of Cannorian homesteaders and the fury of Veykodan magic could not withstand the tides of our imperial battalions, just like their hearts of rugged stone were moved to reason by the Teal Crest’s gentle sway.\n\nMore can still be done to ease the tensions, yet a trickle of trade, migration - and most importantly, tribute - has been established between our three peoples. This trickle can become a torrent once we clear out the waterways and build more markets and river-docks, our city sure to become the one true entrepot into the Pansvovych.\n\nAt the same time, Arverynn must remain a shield, a dam that can filter out the poisonous religions of barbarians and Cannorians lest this refreshing current of change turns into a crashing wave of mud."
 emergency_measures_title:0 "Emergency Measures"
 emergency_measures_desc:0 "Alas! These are dark times indeed. Our coffers are empty, our troops can't even afford crude wooden shields. Dispassionate captains hold half-baked speeches, while bridges and roads are left to crumble. Our botanists are threatening to seek employment elsewhere, leaving our trees to wilt, and a walkway snapped under a visitor's feet the other day. Win a war against neighbouring lords? How can we, when our troops' current pay leaves them shy of even the fish jumping out of the River? It appears we will need to call forth one more sacrifice, for the good of Arverynn and the realm.\n\nOnly, let us be wary: many were the sacrifices Lord Calrodiy IV asked of his populace and friends during his rulership, and should this be for nothing one more time, the consequences will be much graver than a simply disgruntled populace."

These streets have lost the fool and the proud, and the temple-going."\n\n-Lament for Arverynn, Lord Galinval, 13th century ruler of Arverynn\n\nEver since the Dark Ages of the Ynn, Arverynn’s cityscape has resembled a collection of villages and communities surrounded by walls.

Decisive, concerted action is needed."

 the_northern_connection_desc:0 "Thromshana, Marketside. That's the name of a Iosahar who truly kept their oaths even in the darkest hour, when Alaran defeated us. Now that urgent matters are out of the way, it is time we turned our attention to this loyal subject: we hereby decree Thromshana is to be the second beneficiary of imperial public works, after the capital itself. The market square will be renewed, and we will offer audience to the mayor to listen to what the town needs to prosper, whether it be a new road or a new militia.\n\nNaturally, this will lead to closer cooperation, as imperial functionaries move to and from Thromshana to oversee the works, understating that our states are one and the same and ending any 'Free City' nonsense."

 repopulate_the_countryside_desc:0 "Taking care of the towns is fair and good, but no city can be sustained without swathes of farmland to provide food for its inhabitants and livestock for its soldiers and crafters. The banks of the Moon Field, northeast of Arverynn, offer one such swathe of fertile land waiting to be tilled by farmers, so long as we can offer them protection. The same is true for the vineyards of Horpanas, which can be renewed and expanded through alliances with the right landholders.\n\nAll around the city of Arverynn, a vast fertile plain will be painted in the colours of grain and vegetables, echoing with the calls of animals and the amiable chatter of farmer's markets. And Arverynn will be ever within sight, figuring with its lengthy high walls like one massive castle."
 sarda_stability_title:0 "Zalagon Pananek"
 sarda_stability_desc:0 "The City of Emperors notwithstanding, Ynnic society is in essence agricultural. An unwritten collection of rules and customs dictated the interactions between farmers and hunters, helping settle their disputes over game, wild crops and land ownership since ancient times. These norms were then put to law by Ynnic emperors, who tweaked them from time to time as necessity demanded.\n\nNow that our agrarian economy is a source of pride among Ynnics, attracting the interest of traders and Buyovec alike, we can re-visit these laws and organize them into a single extensive code: Zalagon Pananek, or Farmer's Law. This will bring order and stability to our demesne today, and a foundation for the entire's Ynn agricultural laws tomorrow."

Our ever-increasing army will enjoy the additional quarters, our brilliant courtiers will marvel at the new talents within the kitchen staff, our generals will stand atop the new walls confident in the artillery-resistant runic magic, visiting nobles will find immaculate bedrooms featuring swan feather pillows that put even our most powerful Iosahar to shame.\n\nAnd all around the people of the Lower City will relish the bulwark of our power, upwards they will gaze and be awed, an array of towers and suspended walkways leading their mind and attention to the Teal Keep up high on Vyrisar Hill."

The flow of Veykodan mercenaries and adventurers to our capital has dried out, replaced by a flow of refugees pleading for the Emperor to intervene.\n\nWhile many are celebrating this ironic twist of fate - Veykodan warriors being too busy fighting for their lands to raid our borders, that is - these events risk spelling the end of the Veykodan Guard. Our most cautious advisors are even suggesting that Krarhnorians make no difference between Buycev and Ynnics, seeing both as "natives" who need to be exterminated for the glory of their nations, and that once they are done with Veykoda, we will be next.\n\nA laughable thought, for sure! And yet, our people are known for their caution…"
 radavezyr_title:0 "Radavezyr"
 radavezyr_desc:0 "Historically, the emperors at Arverynn projected influence over Veykoda with a light touch, keeping Cannorian homesteaders cooperative. Veykodan natives were supported at times, like when in 1724 Emperor Trandir II sent a unit of Teira Manhunters to put an end to the Ivory Wars between New Havoral and the Osindain tribes, however nativism never figured among the Teal Keep's public objectives.\n\nNo imperial army marched east to rescue their fellow Ruinborn, and the vassal kingdom of Veykoda was only established through an unlikely series of events that Corinsfield's invasion set in motion.\n\nHowever, if things had gone differently, if Arverynn's rise had been faster and its grip on Sarda tighter, surely an Emperor would have rewarded the services of the Veykodan Guard by riding east, carving out a faithful client kingdom and bestowing a crown to one of their own so that they too could be King of the Castle, right?"

Not one to usually risk death under a rain of arrows shot by the jumpy Sarda, he had nonetheless come visit his fellow chieftains Szannem and Sronzar.\n\nThe first thing Rapanach noticed was how much clothing the two of them bore. How was he meant to recognize them, now that their vibrant tattoos were hidden by layers of plain cloth? But he recognized their voices, and the runic patterns on their faces and hands. "Szannem! Sronzar! At least they don't force you to wear knights' helmets, huh?" He joked, expecting a laugh from his old friends, even now that they were captains of the Veykodan Guard. And laugh they did, and the three spoke for hours.\n\n"…What do you mean you're not coming back?" Rapanach asked, suddenly taken off-guard. "Surely, you must have big plans. Retire and found a Veykodan kingdom of your own, finally get rid of the emperors and sack this city, grab a souvenir to bring back to your tribe, or anything else…"\n\nSzannem sternly replied: "Rapanach, the only thing we plan is a comfortable retirement, settling the lands the [Root.EmperorEmpress] has promised us with our families and friends."\n\nRapanach froze for a moment, his old friend's voice was without a hint of sarcasm. "What about our people?!" Rapanach croaked. "Rapanach, I'm sorry…" Sronzar intervened, glancing at his fellow Veykodan mercenaries and the Sarda peasants traversing the road. "This is our people now, and if you continue committing sedition… you might be arrested."\n\nSedition?!? Cursing fate, Rapanach mustered all his willpower to hold back the magical fury that began boiling through his veins, and abandoned his friends and their city, their paths having diverged forever."

 flavor_arverynn.5.d:0 "The Predyvens System was a system of land division established by Arverynn in the decades following the War of the Bacaran Succession. A Predyvis was a grant that temporarily transferred fiscal rights to an individual or institution: most commonly they were taxes or incomes from cultivated lands, seldom water and fishing rights, or customs collection. Rights over a piece of land could be distributed among different individuals, so a person could have the rights to all revenues from the local stream, while his neighbour had the lumber rights from the adjacent forest.\n\nGrants were for a set period, usually lifetime, and revocable at will by the Emperor. Grants to institutions, such as the toll revenue from the Tromseloc Way granted to the Trom Throm Rance, were effectively in perpetuity for the institution's lifespan. Grants were not transferable or hereditary; a Predyvis gave the grantee possession, not ownership, which remained Imperial. In rare cases, Predyvis were granted to a house rather than an individual, in which case it effectively became hereditary.\n\nBuilt upon the Zalagon Pananek, existing feudal laws, and experience handling Pomentere Estates since the formation of the Veykodan Guard, the system was an innovation, but still firmly feudal. It allowed Arverynn to frequently reorganize estates or rights when needed. Often times, a Predyvis apt to support a single Ynnic Knight would be divided to support several infantrymen instead. As most of the organization of the Predyvens system was handled by the Imperial Functionaries rather than the Emperor directly, it was also prone to corruption, the functionaries often granting Predyvis to family members, colleagues, or made up individuals to collect the revenue themselves."

Carts full of clothes were regularly brought in, for no warrior could go shirtless except during a few ceremonial games, and guards had to get proper metal armour from a smith. Luckily, they were just in the right place.\n\nThis was the Havak Buyovec District, the Foreign Smith District, which could also be translated as Warforge District. Unofficially, it was regarded as the Veykodan district, but its primary purpose was to provide equipment enhanced by Veykodan magic to the imperial army - runic armour, recently developed, was in high request and required constant maintenance - a task which its inhabitants were aptly pursuing, as surveyors could attest from the fumes of smelting copper, the pungent smell of tanning, and the lines of Veykodans waiting to donate their magical blood to the closest rune scribe."

There were temples blending in with the buildings, and doors which led to towers spiralling above the district, linked to the suspended walkways and usually reserved to guards and tour guides.

Benches and tables were laid out in front of him, on the inn's terrace, where a halfling woman sat dressed in a padded coat and a blue ribbon hat; her gaze shifted up to the construction crew of halflings and dwarves who were finishing the inn's front and third floor, then down to the rest of the district below, particularly the river-wharves from which came barges of migrants and goods from the eastern homesteads.\n\nSuspecting she was the head of the business, Tulok sat next to her and struck conversation.

Cannor is stuck with the idea that dwarves should build everything, but here in the Ynn halflings still have a chance to carve out at least a slice of the construction market!"

A curl forms on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s lips, hearing of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favourite breakfast. The door gently creaks open as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gets up from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bed and grabs a morning dress, just in time to greet [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] friend.\n\nThe abundant sunlight beckons them through the castle's windows as they walk down the hallway, guards and courtiers along the way all recognize the person by the [Root.EmperorEmpress]'s side and greet them warmly when they don't ask to join them outright.\n\nAfter a lovely breakfast by the east-side-facing terraced garden, where many of the Teal Keep's residents are allowed to come and eat the gardener's fruits, the two resume their morning walk, going up to the parapets, on which grow some fresh vines whose leaves bear a pleasant rainy fragrance.\n\n"I see the walkways are becoming more verdant than ever!" [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] comments, gazing at the variety of potted plants hanging from the city's many walkways, in a colourful array not even the hair strands of all Sarda nobility could match now. "Only thanks to the quality soil you've bought!" The halfling replies, beaming for another day of working.\n\n"Hello!" A commoner with her daughter call out from their window, their home also decorated by vine-plants that complement their white walls with green stems and purple flowers.\n\nIt was as if he had been a part of this city, of this royal court, for years now. A short, very modest man, he was dear to all and known as 'the gardener'. Or 'the [Root.EmperorEmpress]'s best friend'. Some would even say, '[Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sidekick'."
 flavor_arverynn.22.d5:0 "Creak… thump! A long convoy of trade carriages proceeded through the woodlands, announced by the sound of their large sturdy wheels and the neighing of their horses, while the roofs of white cloth covered its occupants from the Sarda sun. Unbeknownst to them, the infamous bandit leader, Talvyr Nizelynn, was on the prowl.\n\nSchwing… THWACK! A rush of arrows darted from all sides, snuffing the life of the convoy's guards. The bandits wasted no time jumping up and surrounding the convoy.\n\n"Great job, my fellows… now, let's search the interior of these carav-" Talvyr could not say his second sentence when he was interrupted by the agonizing scream coming from inside a caravan. It was the voice of one of his companions. \n\n"Momir!" Talvyr called out, entering the caravan only to see his lifeless friend lay in a puddle of blood. "You will pay for this!" Talvyr unsheathed his knife, looking for his opponent when-\n\nSWING! Down from caravan's roof he jumped, dressed in simple clothes of linen and leather which concealed his muscles, cutting off the bandit leader's head with a single strike of his blade. Talvyr's head rolled to the ground, and his bandits scattered as the convoy's survivors began fighting back, killing some of them in the process.\n\nMonths later, the mysterious bandit-slayer showed up at the gates of Arverynn, and called out for the [Root.EmperorEmpress].\n\n"[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]! Ever since Sarda bandits slew some of my friends, I only desired revenge on the Sarda people! To see them beaten and brought in chains! And wherever I ask, YOU, [Root.EmperorEmpress], are the biggest enemy of a free Sarda! So let me join you, so I can kill and send even more of your people to their deaths!"\n\nThe [Root.EmperorEmpress], a bit surprised by this logic, was not entirely taken aback. In fact, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] strangely felt a sense of… kinship? And so [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stepped out, walked up to the mysterious bandit-slayer, and stared him down… before they both grinned and shook hands warmly."

The Veykodan Buycev have retreated deeper into the temple, outnumbered by our troops and our own Veykodan mercenaries.\n\nCautiously, our mages disarm the rune-laden paper sheets the Veykodans have left along the way, and a magical staff banishes the darkness from the temple's inner hallways, highlighting a beautiful mosaic of the Sun, the Moon and the Ynn stretching through recurve walls.\n\nOnly one way leads further down, a dusty wooden trapdoor in a corner by the end of the hallway. Should we ignore it and block it, the raiders will surely starve in the underground levels of the mound-temple, turning on each other like Wendigos or withering as they desperately claw for a way out. However, one can only wonder what secrets lie beneath the temple, whether treasure, curses, or threats to this land that must not be allowed to grow a minute longer."

Marching onwards, they cut down what seemed to be reanimated creatures - war-hounds, lynxes, fowls, rats…\n\nThey came across a barricaded wooden door, smashing their way in with a powerful tackle by one of our knights. What ensued was a fast-firing exchange of magic spells between our mages and cultists. When it was over, most contenders on both sides lay dead, only a few imperial knights and Veykodan mercenaries still standing.\n\nTheir attention was drawn by the sealed gate on the other side of the room, lined with wine-red leather and silver studs. It seemed not even the cultists' magic could breach it, leaving but a few blast marks. The gate had a small keyhole, with the symbol of the Teal Crest carved in silver next to it. The surviving imperial troops tacitly made plans to turn back and get help to bury the bodies, when another individual stepped into the room.\n\nIt was [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 flavor_arverynn.25.d:0 "The decade surrounding Emperor Fineas's death was a chaotic haze, events being blurred together, rearranged, and forgotten. The emperor, ever-searching for an innovative solution to bring his Empire back from the brink, enlisted mages from near and far. Most promising among them was Doukanszrim, an affable old Veykodan with a slender body and a captivating smile, skillful with people as he was with substances.\n\nDoukanszrim enticed the emperor with his ideas to negate inequality and soothe the spirits of Arverynn's populace, however, at the time when he was needed the most, Doukanszrim fled and placed a spell on the populace to cover his tracks, leaving the Emperor at the mercy of his own frenzied subjects.\n\nContinuing to read through the Imperial Archives, one will learn that Kanvel, the defunct emperor's sister, repeatedly accused Doukanszrim for the disappearance of several items, including the Vyrekynn's personal keys, several tonnes of Damestear, but also people and animals: most ominously, the emperor's pet otter which went missing exactly one year before Fineas's death. It is also believed that he fled to Munkarel, the same monastery Kanvel was exiled to, using the Vyrekynn keys to access the deepest level of the dungeon and make it into his hideout, playing a part in its eventual fall.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] launched an expedition into the Moon Field, using the pretext of Veykodan raids as a simple excuse to bring vengeance to the Vyrekynn family, finally unearthing the secrets beneath the Moon Mound."

A torch was lit up, and what they saw was not a peerless arcane mage, but something equally startling: a chimera, a creature made from the amalgamation of several others. It had the tail of a beaver, the webbed feet of an otter, and the billed head of a duck. Several of them were crawling through the cave, feeding on little spiders, bug eggs and crayfish.\n\n"My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], please stand back.

A Malacnari captain is leading the defense, and he emboldens their spirits masterfully, reminding them that Calrodiy was equally outnumbered, and he didn't have walls nor a gigantic mound to protect him. In his heart, the captain is thankful to the fates for giving him such a picturesque stage for his last stand.\n\nTwo southron soldiers mutter something as they sit by one of the towers' stairs.

While Sarda bards try their best to smooth tensions, Ynnic farmers lay out tables with produce and Rune Scribes design an area as the field of games: rhino leaping, tug of war, chunkey, and even a dreaded lacrosse match will see our Ynnic knights pitted against tribal champions of the east.\n\nMembers of the Veykodan Guard stand aside at first, for not everyone of their kin looks favourably upon their career. But as festivities mount up, tension mellows and they soon join the dancing and singing until the moon is high up in the sky.\n\n"So, what should we call the animal?" A river-priest asks [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. "I don't know…" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] replies, not sure whether a portmanteau or a punny name would be better. They are however interrupted by commotion from within the temple.\n\nAs one robed individual emerges, everyone freezes up. There was no mistaking it, Doukanszrim had awakened. He spat foul words: "Curse you, Berry the Once-otter!" and launched a glowing azure sphere against the [Root.EmperorEmpress]. However, one of the newly-discovered creatures swiftly jumped up and, imbued of the same magic, swung its tail to deflect the attack back at the mage, who fell to the ground and finally croaked."

A brawny, rowdy redhead spoke. "I don't think Sarda ladies will be interested in your advances, if they're anything like the elven women back home." A brunette boy with a cape and glasses promptly joked, sporting a grin. "What about you, Armand?"\n\nThe clanking of the city gates interrupted them, and past the guardpost they peered at Arverynn's interior: a wide street was lined up with tall houses decorated in wavy serpentine patterns, and sprawling trees with leaves and flowers skillfully cared-for. The street continued for kilometers, at times surrounded by pristine tall structures and overarching ropeways, at times lined up with nothing but humble grass, as it winded through the Karel mounds over which Arverynn's districts were distributed; one Karel stood taller than all, making the rest figure as "Lower City": it was Vyrisar Hill, atop which was a castle known to the locals as 'Drelven Vezl', the Teal Keep.\n\nPeople traversing the streets were both magical and mundane, pointy-eared city guards in glimmering mail somberly watched traders of colourful robes accompanied by pet dogs or carts full of wine drawn by antlered creatures, the strike of a hammer and the spark of a furnace were followed by a glow of magical energy, ominous choirs came from places of worship, and you could see folk sporting a bat nose, tribal paint and ivory necklaces true to the Cannorian conception of Ruinborn.\n\nArverynn was a city of beauty, and while beauty alone does not deter human greed, the would-be conquerors somberly understood that the legend they were trying to take on still bore a similar magnitude as the inviolable glades of Iorellen or the booming metropolis of Anbenncóst."

This path also proved arduous, as client rulers were often overthrown and succeeded by heirs who immediately rescinded all ties to Arverynn.\n\nWhile Krarhnorian governments are more stable than tribes, they change rulers just as fast and are keen on skirmishing with each other, which can quickly escalate into war and annexation when we're not watchful. Our advisors are suggesting that we create strong ties with one particular state, either a weak one to keep the stronger in check, or a strong one to keep the others from challenging it.

House yen Stantir was one of the most prestigious dynasties of all Sarda, and could directly trace its lineage from the Imperial line.

 string_start_Arverynn:0 "§g\"Take me back to the Northward River, as I sing a song; a floating rhyme rippling through time towards the City of Forever."\n-To the Garrisons' opening verse, Talvyr yen Arkilodo, Sarda Poet.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\n§YArverynn§!, Jewel of the Ynn, City of Emperors, Mound-Fortress: these and many more titles echo across the art and memories of §YYnnic Ruinborn§!. Founded in 900 after Flood by the Soldier-Emperor §YCalrodiy the Great§!, first of his name, Arverynn shone as a brand-new beacon of civilization at a time when the majority of elvenkind was living at sea or surrounded by ruins.\n\nAs beautiful as it was impregnable, only the perverted actions of the dragon §YDrozmagog§! and his cultists could hope to strike at the imperial capital, and even that didn't last - the damage inflicted by the §YGreat Fire of Arverynn§! in 1028 was quickly undone through a mobilization of the §YYnnic Empire§!.\n\nThe §YThird Ynnic Civil War§! saw the dissolution of the Ynnic Empire and the ruin of its urban centers; despite this, Arverynn's ruin did not come from an outside conqueror, but from within, when in 1205 after Flood a famished mob lynched Emperor §YFineas Vyrekynn§!. A most foul event, which spelled the end of Calrodiy's line and of the Ynnic Empire. Or so people thought…\n\n§ORecent History§!\nArverynnics have a name for the 13th and 14th centuries: the §YAge of Petty Lords§!. A string of minor nobles ruled the great city, trying to manage its §Yshrinking populace§! while fighting off economic decline, the odd rabble-rousing preacher and the schemes of their own court. Some of these rulers appealed to Arverynn's prestige, but they struggled subduing §YStanyrhrada§! or keeping the §YVeykodan§! raiders at bay. Reuniting §YSarda§!, let alone the whole Empire, seemed a pipe dream. The Lordship of Arverynn was destined to become a backwater, eclipsed by the feudal §YDolindhan§! powers of §YAmaceped§! and §YAmacimst§! and by the nearby §YVels Bacar§!…\n\nThen in 1386, the Emperor returned. §YCalrodiy IV§! announced himself as the last scion of the §YVyrekynn§! dynasty, as he emerged from the horizon at the head of a company of shining knights and mercenaries. The petty lord who was occupying Arverynn did not dare resist him, disappearing into the night as his name was forgotten by history. The city celebrated Calrodiy as a liberator, and he returned this warmth with weeks of festivities. However, this victory would be Calrodiy's first and last.\n\nThe aspiring emperor overestimated his neighbours' willingness to submit to him and rejoin the glorious empire, losing the chance for peaceful reunification with his diplomatic blunders. His lavish festivities put a dent in the coffers, and he alienated even his closest supporters, first through unrealistic and insistent demands, like when he asked the captain of his knights to "tell his soldiers to bring better armour for tomorrow's battle", then by becoming cruel as his frustrations grew. In 1444, Calrodiy IV has one foot in the grave, his defeat against the young §YAlaran§! of §YTrompolere§! still bleeding him of his pride.\n\nDespite these circumstances, it is not our lot to despair. The lives of Ynnic elves are short, and their wisdom fallible. But there is no doubt in the mind of the citizens that we are primed for greatness, that §Tno matter how deep we sink§! or how violently the earth trembles, §Twe will emerge§! and thrive. Arverynn is 500 years old: an impressive age, if this were a Veykodan hamlet. For the capital of the §YYnn§! ten thousand years would not suffice, so let us move on, for there is much to live for and much to be done, as long as the Ynn wills it."
