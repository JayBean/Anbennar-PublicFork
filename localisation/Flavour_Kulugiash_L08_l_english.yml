 flavour_kulugiash.1.t:0 "A Long Awaited Return"
 flavour_kulugiash.1.d:0 "Daylight would be coming soon, Bayek thought. They would need to find a place to camp out before Gnollish patrols began to start roaming the desert. While he was eyeing a defensible rocky outcropping for a suitable cave, shouts began to ring out among the vanguard of the party. Coming down to investigate the commotion, a runner sprinted up to him. \n\ 'General Bayek Sir! Word from our homeland!' He exclaimed breathlessly, 'They’ve heard of our trek, and will be seeking to secure our safe passage through the North!' \n\ Perhaps he might be blessed enough to gaze upon his home in the Tabbanor highlands once again after all, thought Bayek. \n\ Traveling at the head of the party, Bayek was among the first to finally glimpse their homeland as they crested the hill. Rolling savanna, vast herds of quagga tended by sun-baked shepherds, and the deep green waters of the Imidiqaar river stretched out before his eyes."
 flavour_kulugiash.1.a:0 "At last, somewhere worth fighting for."

 flavour_kulugiash.2.t:0 "A theory of war"
 flavour_kulugiash.2.d:0 "General Bayek sat at his writing desk. Of all his battlefield victories, army reforms, and logistical accomplishments, this undertaking may be this most significant. He penned down all the knowledge and experience he had gained in a lifetime of war, stretching back from his youth in the military academies of Kheterata to his leadership in his native Kulugiash. He was not alone in his effort. He had enjoined all his lieutenants and adjutants to do the same, creating a vast corpus of military knowledge from which their successors could draw. \n\ He used up several wells worth of ink that night writing, and when day broke, announced by the bugles blaring outside his tent, he could only hope that the effort was not in vain."
 flavour_kulugiash.2.a:0 "There is yet more to do."

 flavour_kulugiash.3.t:0 "Equine equity"
 flavour_kulugiash.3.d:0 "Shrill cries ring out as merchants hawk their goods in the bustling marketplace of one of Kulugiash’s new ranch-towns. $RULERNAME$’s entourage snakes through crowded streets and between towering temples as they tour the settlement, taking in the prosperity wrought by the crown’s policy. Not all in the group are content to observe, however, as the bickering of one pair of elites has begun to disrupt the entire outing. A Medawor noble, sword at the waist, and an Efergezmu merchant dressed in gleaming fineries approach $RULERNAME$ with their quandary - how should the excess production of our ranches be utilized? The noble, a high ranking general, argues that, as a military project, any excess should be reinvested towards expanding military infrastructure. Alternatively, the merchant suggests that the extra animals be sent to support construction efforts throughout the country, boosting our economic engine."
 flavour_kulugiash.3.a:0 "Scoffing, the merchant departs with his attendants."
 flavour_kulugiash.3.a.tt:0 "The Nobility Estate Privilege Monopoly on Livestock will now grant us -10% construction cost!"
 flavour_kulugiash.3.b:0 "Gritting his teeth, the noble relents."

 flavour_kulugiash.4.t:0 "The Balance Broken"
 flavour_kulugiash.4.d:0 "Death to Traitors! \n\ Glory to Our Heroes! \n\ Onlookers gazed in amazement as banners bearing these slogans were draped over the palace walls in $CAPITAL$. \n\ In the dawn hours of $DATE$, while $RULERNAME$ was away, a group of rebels led by Mkumo !Xe Iqhusye had seized the palace and instigated plans to form an army to depose $RULERNAME$ and enforce Efergezmu authority. Bands of enthusiastic rebels, organized by members of the Efergezmu elite, who saw $RULERNAME$ as a traitor caving to the interests of a foreign class, descended upon the capital to join the struggle."
 flavour_kulugiash.4.a:0 "We must join up with our Medawor allies, and put down this revolt."
 flavour_kulugiash.4.a.tt:0 "Failing to rid our country of rebels upon the Supremacy Confirmed will yield us penalties!"

 flavour_kulugiash.5.t:0 "The Balance Broken"
 flavour_kulugiash.5.d:0 "'His Excellency $RULERTITLE$ $RULERNAME$, \n\ It is with grave solemnity that I send this missive, but your actions regarding the Efergezmu have left us no choice. By your alignment with such a domineering and exclusionary faction, we have been forced to seek alternative recourse to ensure that our people, who have sacrificed much, and played such an important role in elevating this realm, are not forever erased from its future. Glory to Kulugiash and her valiant army. \n\ Her loyal general, Andil !Xe Intef"

 flavour_kulugiash.6.t:0 "Supremacy Confirmed"
 flavour_kulugiash.6.d:0 "$RULERNAME$ returned to a capital ill at ease. Rebel slogans and graffiti still remained on walls throughout the city. His liberating army, primarily composed of Khetists, was not greeted by cheers and exultation, but closed doors and quiet streets. The city would eventually return to its usual state, he knew, and there would be no reprisals, but the people would come to recognize a new state of affairs. The alliance between him and the Medawor was now set in stone, and the Khetist faith would become the new religion of politics."
 flavour_kulugiash.6.a:0 "The upstarts have been rebuked, and a new future shall come to Kulugiash."
 flavour_kulugiash.6.b:0 "Disgraceful!"
