  bosancovac_reconciliation_title:0 "Reconciliation"
  bosancovac_reconciliation_desc:0 "The ongoing struggle over the sovereignty of Malacnar and Amacimst is of no benefit to the parties involved; we need to use other, less hostile means to reign them in. Faced with a conciliatory attitude backed by the full might of Bosancovac, these troublemakers will have no choice other than to accept the generous terms we offer them.\n\nThe Grebniesth Gardens in the north are a very suitable spot to conduct diplomacy and the use of such a venue is sure to leave a good impression on the attending diplomats, helping us further in setting an agreeable mood around the negotiations."

  bosancovac_subdue_the_rabblerousers_title:0 "Subdue the Rabble-Rousers"
  bosancovac_subdue_the_rabblerousers_desc:0 "Bostynn is a hotbed for outlaws and rebels; their efforts have not only destabilized the province, but have bled to the nearby areas as well. We have to get rid of these unfavorable elements by any means necessary! And what better way to quell dissent than to send Peacekeepers of the Guard to end the madness and establish control over the area?"
  bostynn_revolt_tt:0 "Is in a state of revolt."

  bosancovac_repatriate_the_tromseloc_way_title:0 "Repatriate the Tromseloc Way"
  bosancovac_repatriate_the_tromseloc_way_desc:0 "During the disaster that was the fall of the Ynnic Empire, the former province of Trvoselin, along the Tromseloc Way, was ravaged by the Veykodan tribes and wendigo attacks. Now, after a long time, we have the ability to retake a land many of our people regard as their ancestral home. The time for debate is over; now we must act and start the repopulation of this area!"

  bosancovac_reimagining_the_dams_title:0 "Reimagining the Dams"
  bosancovac_reimagining_the_dams_desc:0 "Every civilization worth its weight leaves a trace of its culture and art behind for future generations to study and admire; built by our ancestors, the Ynnic dams are such pieces of cultural brilliance. As our ships pass by the dams, appreciation rises for the guardians who keep the legacy of our forefathers functioning and clean… but is that all there is to our rule?\n\nNo - we must leave our mark on Ynnic culture and history! Let us redecorate these magnificent pieces of architecture in our image, commissioning the brightest and most skilled of our artists and architects to create a façade that reflects the glory of Bosancovac!"

  bosancovac_just_doing_business_title:0 "Just Doing Business"
  bosancovac_just_doing_business_desc:0 "Cannorians are an odd bunch to those unfamiliar with the ways of a merchant, those who fail to get with the times and develop new business strategies - but for the people of Bosancovac? A Cannorian is just like any other buyer waiting to be persuaded.\n\nAs are our own subjects, actually. Their lands still remain behind the times in terms of development. We should use our newly learned Cannorian-inspired business strategies to "invest" in their lands."

  bosancovac_a_gemstone_currency_title:0 "A Gemstone Currency"
  bosancovac_a_gemstone_currency_desc:0 "Our reliance on Vels Domfan minting and book-keeping could prove problematic in the long run, if we seek to rapidly increase the volume of outgoing trade. Recently there has been a debate on this topic, and the consensus seems to be that an alternate currency could be worth the monumental initial investment and effort. The gems of Argezvale, and in particular their rubies, have come up regularly during said debates, and they are certainly worth a strong consideration!"

  bosancovac_technological_showcase_title:0 "Technological Showcase"
  bosancovac_technological_showcase_desc:0 "With advanced metallurgical and faceting methods now commonplace among Bosancovac artisans, we can put all of our technological innovations on show. Catching up technologically with most of our Cannorian neighbors has earned us a certain level of admiration, and we should use our diplomatic prowess in combination with this newly gained attention to set the stage for even bigger leaps in the future. Inviting technologically competent countries to our showcase could be a step in the right direction."

  bosancovac_a_noble_rivalry_title:0 "A Noble Rivalry"
  bosancovac_a_noble_rivalry_desc:0 "The Noble Realms of Amacimst and Malacnar boast some of Ynn’s best fighters, with their rivalry being just as renowned across the Ynn. To help consolidate our strategic position we must bring this tension to the brink. The threat of our forces joining either side should be enough to force one of them to overthrow the other, as bloody an affair as that might be."

  bosancovac_network_of_faith_title:0 "Network of Faith"
  bosancovac_network_of_faith_desc:0 "With the inevitable rise of Bosancovac, so should rise its benefactors. The Clergy have time and time again proven to be the backbone of our country and if we are to tighten our grip on the region, controlling its faithful through our loyal clergy must be a high priority. With enough political support, our priests will have a much easier time preaching the ways of our faith, and the good we have done for the faithful."
  bosancovac_network_temple_tt:0 "(2 Subjects):\n   Gain §YTemple§! in Capital"

  bosancovac_found_the_city_guard_title:0 "Found the City Guard"
  bosancovac_found_the_city_guard_desc:0 "With Bosancovac now prospering, it is pertinent that we guard it from threats, be it on the outside or the inside. The traditional guardsmen of the city need to receive further investments into their training and equipment projects to bolster our defenses and keep our citizens safe."
  boasncovac_build_garrison_tt:0 "§GUnlock building the Garrison district.§!"

  bosancovac_guidance_of_the_river_title:0 "Guidance of the River"
  bosancovac_guidance_of_the_river_desc:0 "If we are to look outside, first we must make sure that Bosancovac has all the resources it needs to support such an effort. An issue that has come to our attention is that The Temple’s operations require more incense; such a resource has traditionally been sourced from Imstana, but we should utilize the farms under the control of the merchants to secure more incense by increasing productivity in the province and establishing more farms."
  bosancovac_tromseloc_tt:0 "§GYou may restore the Tromseloc Way.§!"

  bosancovac_develop_new_industries_title:0 "Develop New Industries"
  bosancovac_develop_new_industries_desc:0 "Resources of many different kinds and quality now flow through Bosancovac; the city is as lively as ever and the industry is being worked to capacity. However, we should not grow complacent. To further increase the Treasury’s weight we should move away from producing raw resources and opt for manufactured naval supplies such as ropes and lamp oil that will help our merchant fleet in the long run."
  bosancovac_build_warehouse_tt:0 "§GUnlock building the Warehouse district.§!"

  bosancovac_finding_a_niche_title:0 "Finding a Niche"
  bosancovac_finding_a_niche_desc:0 "Having taken an interest in our sturdy ropes and lamp oil, some famed adventuring companies have contacted us and expressed their desire to secure a steady supply of these goods for their guild and crew. Indeed, such quality product is a very useful tool for exploration! Furthermore, our position allows us to act as a middleman between the Cannorians of the Expanse and those in Veykoda, a position to be leveraged as soon as possible!"
  boasncovac_build_foreign_quarter_tt:0 "§GUnlock building the Foreign Quarter district.§!"

  bosancovac_improved_metallurgy_title:0 "Improved Metallurgy"
  bosancovac_improved_metallurgy_desc:0 "If we are to create high quality manufactured goods, we need to be able to source quality material for it. A fundamental piece of this puzzle will always be advanced metal alloys and combinations of different alchemical processes that lead to their creation. It has come to our attention that a particular alloy made of Iron and Copper can result in a very flexible, highly durable product useful for making springs, which could in turn be used in several fields of engineering, such as clock-making. Our resources should be directed at these efforts to pave the way for future industrial and economic growth."
  bosancovac_metallurgy_tt:0 "In up to 10 §YIron§! or §YCopper§! provinces owned by [Root.GetName] or a subject:\n   Gain §G1§! Base Production.\n   Gain §G1.00§! Innovativeness."

  bosancovac_standard_time_clock_terminal_title:0 "Standard Time Clock Terminal"
  bosancovac_standard_time_clock_terminal_desc:0 "Watermills have long been an iconic feature of the Ynn's riverside. However with our advancements in clockwork, improvements could be made to them to incorporate clockwork into their designs. With this increased prevalence of clocks, we will also need a central clock tower in Bosancovac to serve as a standard and accurately coordinate clocks throughout the Ynn."
  bosancovac_clock_tower_tt:0 "Display the Bosancovac Clock Tower §YAmbient Object§!."

  bosancovac_clockwork_city_title:0 "Clockwork City"
  bosancovac_clockwork_city_desc:0 "The Ynn has adopted our standard clock and centered regional time around the clock tower of Bosancovac; now we should take this trend to a new level and truly transform the floating city. The Clockwork city is already a common nickname thrown around, and we shall show everyone what that phrase really means!"
  bosancovac_no_overload_tt:0 "§JBosancovac's foundation become adaptable and will no longer become overloaded.§!"

  #Col 3

  bosancovac_secure_more_materials_title:0 "Secure More Materials"
  bosancovac_secure_more_materials_desc:0 "The Floating City, for all its wonder, has one major weakness: Space. The foundations of the city are old and do not leave much room for expansion without significant revamps and investments. Thankfully we should be able to secure enough lumber on our own. As for actually expanding the foundations, we should contact some experts, and the famed architects of Brelar have been assessed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as the best candidates. Now only remains the matter of finding these architects and convincing them to take the job…"

  bosancovac_the_gem_of_dolindha_title:0 "The Gem of Dolindha"
  bosancovac_the_gem_of_dolindha_desc:0 "Our capital has already eclipsed the old Ynnic Capital of Vareynn in wealth and size. Further trade flowing through the city and people flocking to its gates is sure to push its status beyond those of Malacnar and Amacimst and make it the Gem of Dolindha!"
  bosancovac_high_dev_tt:0 "Has lower Development than Bosancovac"

  bosancovac_expand_the_merchant_fleet_title:0 "Expand the Merchant Fleet"
  bosancovac_expand_the_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "With a massive increase in Ynn-bound commercial activity, our old infrastructure and logistics are proving more and more inadequate by the day. We must secure additional lumber from the Drevonsred to keep up with the basic needs of our maritime trade."

  bosancovac_upgrade_trading_ports_tt:0 "\n§GUpgrade our trading ports.§!"

  bosancovac_sway_their_clergy_title:0 "Sway Their Clergy"
  bosancovac_sway_their_clergy_desc:0 "For all their bickering, the decadent lords of Arganynn and Ancovynn are not very popular amongst their people; all they do is scheme against each other and spend time in complacency. If we were to put aside a sizable donation for their temples, we could convince the faithful that we are the true rulers of the Ynn, and that their lords need to be put back in line."
  bosancovac_subject_money_tt:0 "Have at least §Y50.0§!¤ per subject with a province in the Ancovynn or Arganynn groups that does not have §G+200§! opinion of [Root.GetName] or §Y50§! Spy Network from [Root.GetName]."
  bosancovac_cost_tt:0 "[Root.GetName]:"

  bosancovac_rise_of_the_patricians_title:0 "Rise of the Patricians"
  bosancovac_rise_of_the_patricians_desc:0 "The wealthiest of Bosancovac families, also known as The Patricians, already contribute a sizable amount to our nation’s economy. We should increase our ties to these families and keep them close to the court. This way we can incorporate more of them into the government while having a very loyal, very powerful faction at our side, who can provide us with invaluable experience in the matters of state. With their help we shall build a nation that will stand proudly besides the mighty Ynn!"

  bosancovac_formalize_succession_title:0 "Formalize Succession"
  bosancovac_formalize_succession_desc:0 "Choosing a successor for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has always been an informal affair; either the ruling [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] picks a favored candidate or the other priests put forth a suggestion to the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. With a patrician's child as current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] however, it is time to formalize how the succession works. By establishing rules and processes that favor the patricians, they effectively can choose who becomes the next [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
  bosancovac_ruler_tt:0 "Previous ruler died"
  bosancovac_new_ruler_tt:0 "Current ruler is a Merchant's Child."

  bosancovac_centralize_the_temples_title:0 "Centralize the Temples"
  bosancovac_centralize_the_temples_desc:0 "The separation of authority between the Ynnic temples in Svemel, Adbrabohvi, and Bosancovac has caused naught but harm to the harmony of our worship. With Bosancovac now the dominant power of the Ynn, we can afford to change that; all faithful whose presence are graced by the Ynn shall henceforth look to Bosancovac for spiritual guidance!"

  bosancovac_downriver_relations_title:0 "Downriver Relations"
  bosancovac_downriver_relations_desc:0 "In order to ensure that our ferries and other trade ships do not run into problems while sailing to and from the dams, we need to send a friendly delegation to Vels Bacar and keep them on good terms with us. While we’re at it, sending a delegation to Adbrabohvi, the other temple of the Ynn, might be in order to discuss the matters of faith and evaluate their situation."
  bosancovac_free_passage_tt:0 "Receive §Gfree passage§! through the §TVels Bacar§! dam.\n"

  bosancovac_support_the_merchant_fleet_title:0 "Support the Merchant Fleet"
  bosancovac_support_the_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "The reputation of The Holy Merchant Fleet usually precedes its presence in any Ynnic harbor; we need to bolster its capabilities to match that reputation. By convincing the priests to throw in their investments with the merchants, we should be able to secure enough resources to make it happen, and the subsequent commercial benefits are sure to be worth our while!"

  bosancovac_establish_trading_ports_title:0 "Establish Trading Ports"
  bosancovac_establish_trading_ports_desc:0 "To remove route complications and restrictions facing our merchant fleet, we need to establish forward bases and suitable docking sites along the river. This will benefit everyone living in those areas by providing a steady flow of goods provided by our fleet and maximizing trade efficiency on our side."
  bosancovac_mercantilism_gain_tt:0 "Gain §G1§! Mercantilism per country that meets the conditions and lower their Mercantilism by §R5§!."

  bosancovac_revitalized_administration_title:0 "Revitalized Administration"
  bosancovac_revitalized_administration_desc:0 "Having to manage numerous subject lords and courts is a time-consuming and complicated business, something that we cannot handle with our current institutions.

  bosancovac_hostile_takeover_title:0 "Hostile Takeover"
  bosancovac_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "Dolindhan trade is finally within our full dominion! Gone are the days of leasing small ports to host our merchant fleet; with this newfound power, we can turn the Holy Ports into something permanent, a safe harbor for our trade fleet. Moreover, it is important to expand the capabilities of these ports and turn them into maritime districts to support more and more trade traffic."

  bosancovac_remove_the_false_belief_title:0 "Remove the False Belief"
  bosancovac_remove_the_false_belief_desc:0 "To claim godhood is to withstand a god’s test, and how good is a god if dead? Killed by mere mortals nonetheless! Surely, after the demise of that pathetic dragon god of theirs, the people of Rzenta are ready to see the real light in the flow of the Ynn and accept us as its true priests and representatives?"

  bosancovac_cornering_the_market_title:0 "Cornering the Market"
  bosancovac_cornering_the_market_desc:0 "The last region yet to truly open its markets to our fleet is the Sarda. We must remedy that by sending boats there, this time not with goods but with a few men to "convince" them that commerce is not negotiable."

In an attempt to test our neighbor's border, we have been doing these exercises on the outskirts of Malivab while the Amacimst army is busy elsewhere."

  bosancovac_knights_aboard_title:0 "Knights Aboard"
  bosancovac_knights_aboard_desc:0 "With The Knights Abroad now fully able to coordinate with our regular army, our fighting force is in a prime position to show everyone the true might of Bosancovac! First, however, we need to figure out the matter of the fleet that will work to transport and supply our armies: larger vessels, more transport ships, and more weapons are needed to arm the fleet!"

  bosancovac_expedition_up_vitreynn_title:0 "Expedition Up Vitreynn"
  bosancovac_expedition_up_vitreynn_desc:0 "The dark lands beyond Vitresoln have always been a place of mystery for the inhabitants of the Ynn downstream and with a lack of adequate equipment usually came a lack of large, well-organized expeditions. Our fleet, however, is now equipped with larger ships that can handle such a journey into The Forest of The Cursed Ones, and so we must sail there and see what awaits us!"

  bosancovac_create_a_path_to_the_source_title:0 "Create a Path to the Source"
  bosancovac_create_a_path_to_the_source_desc:0 "The discovery of the source of the Ynn has sent huge ripples throughout Bosancovac, with many wanting us to secure a route there in order to make pilgrimages. While securing a foothold in the Forest of the Cursed Ones will be difficult, we have received reports of strange happenings in the area, and the fear of a third party disturbing something that they do not understand has overcome any reservations that the people held before - we are compelled to investigate even further."
  bosancovac_expedition_tt:0 "The expedition has returned.\n"

  bosancovac_secure_the_lake_title:0 "Secure the Lake"
  bosancovac_secure_the_lake_desc:0 "We have finally made our way back to the source! However, in order for the pilgrims to have a safe journey we must completely secure the area first and root out any attackers or disturbances that may endanger the lives of Ynn’s faithful."

  bosancovac_establish_holy_site_title:0 "Establish the Holy Site"
  bosancovac_establish_holy_site_desc:0 "With a secure route established, now all that needs to be done is to create some infrastructure along the way for pilgrims to stop at. The fork in the river would make for an excellent place to build a hostelry, as it's a halfway point and has good connections via the rivers.\n\nThe holy site will feature an area where pilgrims can enter the source and be cleansed by a priest overseeing the ceremony. Along with this, there will be a great temple overlooking the water with an attached stable for pilgrims to make a trip around the source atop an antler horse. Of course, for these services, the church must collect a tithe from the devout making the trip."

  flavour_bosancovac.000.d:0 "The best prices, in the quickest time, delivered straight to your ports. This is the offer of our Holy Merchant Fleet, as it sails down the Ynn. The tales of the riches of Bosancovac are enough to tempt any to accepting the fleet into their ports for more than just a quick sale, and indeed [From.GetName] has accepted the presence of a trading port in their city!"
  flavour_bosancovac.000.a:0 "This bodes well."
  flavour_bosancovac.000.b:0 "Stop Notifications."

  flavour_bosancovac.010.t:0 "Bosancovac Overloaded"
  flavour_bosancovac.010.d1:0 "Families mourn and weep as their friends, family and loved ones have met a terrible fate, with an entire section of the city's edges collapsing into the Ynn, the weight of the homes upon it and the people in it proving too great for our foundations to bear. Already the people rage and clamor, calling for heads to roll at this gross negligence which has killed so many. We must build a stronger foundation, both for the city and our future."
  flavour_bosancovac.010.d2:0 "A city as great as ours cultivates the growth of a population and the attraction of migrants from across our realm; who dream of a better life. A normal city can grow, and expand to accommodate such occurrences, but ours is no normal city, and advisors council day and night that we must soon expand our foundations… lest we risk a disaster."
  flavour_bosancovac.010.a:0 "You must construct additional foundations!"

  flavour_bosancovac.011.t:0 "Foundation Completed"
  flavour_bosancovac.011.d:0 "Though it was a long and arduous process, dangerous equally for the workers whose hard work was marred by the dangers of the Ynn, we have finally managed to establish a larger foundation for our city. We faced multiple challenges, from the risk of the entire structure falling into the Ynn’s raging waters to the water serpents which lurk within. Running behind all of this was the knowledge that we had risked so much of the riches the merchants have poured into the city. It is no matter now - the new foundation will allow us to expand and grow further than ever before!"
  flavour_bosancovac.011.a:0 "The city, as well as our aspirations have been buoyed."
  bosancovac_foundation_1_tt:0 "This level of foundation will support up to 15 development in Bosancovac."

  flavour_bosancovac.012.t:0 "Water Serpents Attack"
  flavour_bosancovac.012.d:0 "The first thing that was heard was the shout of a panicked worker, then a scream, as the terrible maw of a water serpent burst out of the Ynn, striking at the workers who were doing the hard work of expanding the foundations of our floating city. Already panic spreads through the city, as the demands to do something grow larger and larger from the families of the endangered workers."
  flavour_bosancovac.012.a:0 "A bad omen."
  flavour_bosancovac.012.b:0 "Fight them off!"

  flavour_bosancovac.013.t:0 "Heavy Rains"
  flavour_bosancovac.013.d:0 "For days, rain has hammered down upon the floating city. Usually this would be at the most a minor inconvenience, but with the construction on-going, the workers have been growing increasingly concerned about the potential for disaster. Unfortunately for us, they were proven right, as a considerably heavy day of rain has severely damaged sections of construction; sinking them into the Ynn’s depths, and sending many workers to their doom; and even worse, what we have lost represents a large portion of our investment. A decision needs to be made; whether to start again or whether to attempt to retrieve the lost section of construction and reattach it."
  flavour_bosancovac.013.a:0 "Start from scratch."
  flavour_bosancovac.013.b:0 "Send a team to quickly reattach the lost construction."

  flavour_bosancovac.014.t:0 "Patricians Cover Costs"
  flavour_bosancovac.014.d:0 "Wealthy are our Patricians, and deep are their coffers. They are enigmatic in their decisions and curious in their wants. One particularly wealthy Patrician has decided to cover the cost of our newest efforts to expand the foundations of our cities. They’ve asked for nothing in return, and thus we gladly accepted! We may not understand why they’ve decided to contribute, but we are more than happy with the results!"
  flavour_bosancovac.014.a:0 "That was very cash money of them."

  flavour_bosancovac.015.t:0 "Water Serpents Allow Construction"
  flavour_bosancovac.015.d:0 "At first, the sight of a pair of water serpents bursting free of the Ynn was a sight of terror and horror for the workers, who cowered and sheltered from them as they sailed into the air. The spray of water caught the light of the sun and exploded into a beautiful prismatic spray, not harming any of our workers at all! This was an utterly incredible display, and our clergy are already clamoring to proclaim the Ynn’s blessing on our endeavors!"
  flavour_bosancovac.015.a:0 "A sign from the Ynn!"

  flavour_bosancovac.021.d:0 "When a ship crests a wave on the mighty Ynn and comes into sight of our beloved Bosancovac, the first thing they see is the docks. Vast expanses of platforms and moors, rigging and enough rope to entangle a water serpent, and thus hold the many ships which flock to Bosancovac every single day to see the sights; here a visitor can meet the people and most importantly sell their many wares."

  flavour_bosancovac.022.t:0 "Garrison District"
  flavour_bosancovac.022.d:0 "Floating slightly away from the rest of the city, the Garrison District is connected by canals and a shared glory. This place hosts the city watch, who tirelessly train, patrol and keep our city looking quite so glorious. Occasionally the noble Paddleboards knights grace Bosancovac, to help inspire and train the city watch, and bring them to even new heights of success."
  flavour_bosancovac.022.a:0 "Trust in the Watch!"

  flavour_bosancovac.023.t:0 "Warehouse District"
  flavour_bosancovac.023.d:0 "Between the docks and the mercantile quarter is one of the more mundane districts of our great city, yet in mundanity and simplicity can be found treasures from across the Ynn. Here goods are contained,ready to flow into the merchants’ waiting hands, to continue to grow our cities, and our people's wealth. Mundane in appearance it may be, but to those with a keener eye, the Warehouse District screams of profits to be made."
  flavour_bosancovac.023.a:0 "I can already see the coins flowing."

  flavour_bosancovac.024.t:0 "Foreign Quarter"
  flavour_bosancovac.024.d:0 "As our city has expanded and grown, so too has our prestige and reputation across the Ynn. Thus, to accommodate them and display the wonders of our mighty city, the Foreign Quarter was built. Constructed in opulent style, painted and decorated by the finest artists money can commission, each building is designed perfectly to grant the comforts of home to those dignitaries who come to stay here, enough so that they may want to stay here forever; and truly, with such wonders, who can blame them?"
  flavour_bosancovac.024.a:0 "A home away from home."

  flavour_bosancovac.2100.d:0 ""The tower, brother! It is time to close up and go home.", For the Rugavus brothers, then-young and talented jewel crafters, the erection of the Bosancovac Central Clock was as much a novelty as it was convenient: one could look out the shop and see precisely what the time was, know when the customers were going to arrive to collect their orders, and when exactly one’s newly employed apprentices were going to come and go. Nowadays, hearing the ticking of the clocks is like hearing the heartbeat of a city; stop it for a moment and Bosancovac as a whole will stop functioning. The Rugavus brothers close up their shop at the usual time, 8:30 on the dot – as indicated by the tower - and under the soft and gentle moonlight, its glow mirrored in puddles of water at the corners of the streets, washed clean after a rainy day, they walk out to go back home. As they step out, chatter arises. Back in the day, the central clock used to be the only big clock in the city, but now, the entire city feels like one giant clock, not only because of the clocks, but the outlook and architecture as well.\n\nThe clock works of Bosancovac led to a direction in architectural development where incorporating clockwork into the structures of its buildings resulted in improving their efficiency. This has led to increased use of clocks in general, and the rise in demand eventually made wearing clocks fashionable, with more elaborate and expensive designs being created. such as golden stopwatches with twelve intricate gemstones each indicating a number on the clock. That is part of the reason why the Gnomish district is now brimming with master clocksmiths, who are always busy creating the most reliable yet sophisticated clocks one would ever see in their lifetime. Indeed these masters are responsible for creating some of the greatest devices in the known world, such as the Dam Tik, a gargantuan clock created at the face of the Bosancovac dam with not just one, but two in-built lighthouses responsible for brightening the clock and casting the shadow of its hands on the mighty river. Far has Bosancovac come, from a floating city famous for its unique structure to now being dubbed the Clockwork City, where ticking of the tocks never stops."

One could easily mistake this event as the prelude to war, or some other sort of underhanded business - but the sense of giddy anticipation in the air belied all that. Today, the elves of Bosancovac would row to the ends of the Ynn itself, if such a place even existed.\n\nFew knew what might await them - the forest that shrouded much of the Vitreynn was an impenetrable place, known primarily for the hordes of savage Buycev that called it home, the so called "Cursed Ones" - but if the tenacity of its defenders matched even a fraction of that forest's riches, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew this would be a worthy endeavour indeed."

The sentries maintained their vigil, however, eyes trained on every shadow and potential threats in the trees, magelight and torch-flame their only companion - to break concentration and speak to, even glance at, the elf next to them was to invite death. Unfortunately, their eyes were trained on the wrong place.\n\nNobody knew from whence it came, and nobody knew who its first victim was - when a knight finally managed to let off a blood-curdling scream before being devoured, mangled bodies already littered the deck. And yet it was no Cursed One that the Paddleboard Knights drew their swords on - before them stood a Wendigo, an antlered beast twice the size and strength and speed of the quickest man, and with the hunger of a world beyond their own."

Few bothered to try and cover their ears - it seemed right to at least acknowledge the sacrifice of their comrades. It was a necessary act - how many more men would they have lost trying to take the Wendigo down? But that doesn't mean this decision will set well with the rest of the expedition - their only consolation was that the beast would live to torment the Cursed Ones as well."

  flavour_bosancovac.553.d:0 "The Paddleboard Knight gripped his sword, tight, knuckles white as he waited for an opening against the beast currently ripping through the ship's deck. He could see the lost vessel ahead of him, little more than a pile of burning and floating flotsam, the remains of an attempt to burn the beast, which only blew the ship apart - and enraged the Wendigo further. Wood splintered and cracked as the beast tore through the knights on board like a storm, rending blood, steel and flesh alike, until the antlered monster lunged at another marine positioned near the captain's cabin - at once, every fighter on the deck saw their only chance, the Knight included. The marine was crushed in an instant as the Wendigo pinned him against the wall and killed him with a single snapping bite, but the Ynnics did not let it escape, twenty men rushing in with spears, swords, nets, broken woodwork and whatever else they could gather from the ruin of the ship. Even this uneven fight was bloody - a single swipe from the Wendigo's claws turned five men into eviscerated husks tumbling into the water - but all they needed was time.\n\nEventually, the desperate struggle was interrupted by a commanding shout, as the Knight and his comrades sidestepped to make way for the sailors behind them - for a moment, the beast looked confused - then it howled with an ear-splitting cry of pain, as twenty elves surged forwards, ramming the splintered remains of the ship's mast into the Wendigo's chest. The beast flailed and lashed out widly, taking the head off a sailor in the way of his claws, and rending the chest of another, but soon enough the Knight got lucky again, taking the monster's head off with an opportune swing of his sword.\n\nAs he held it up high for all the men of the expedition to see, the mood was more somber than celebratory. Countless elves lay dead at the Wendigo's feet, and two boats of the expedition had been destroyed almost entirely. One had to wonder if they should've abandoned the first ship to its fate... though one could also wonder if the sight of the Wendigo's head mounted at the ship's prow had any effect on the Cursed Ones - who seemed to be just a little more wary of attacking the travelling Ynnics."

Having been harassed the entire journey by the Cursed Ones, whose raids had grown increasingly dangerous as the river narrowed, the Expedition is dangerously undersupplied, with too many wounded and lost - if we are to continue, we must wait for resupply and reinforcements back at the fork.

Though further travel and investigation showed the body of water was not as infinite as they first believed, and the learned men of the expedition were adamant that the sun was entirely seperate from the Ynn, the lake did not seem to be fed into by any other major rivers - to the vast majority of the expedition, it is clear that they have found the source of the Ynn itself."

Though whispers of some great discovery had permeated the city, none were prepared for what [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] announced there, flanked by supportive river priests and battle scarred veterans - they had discovered the source of the Ynn. Once the jubilation had worn off, it was clear to all in the city what they needed to do next - after all, how could the Ynn's source not be in the hands of the Ynn's faithful?"
