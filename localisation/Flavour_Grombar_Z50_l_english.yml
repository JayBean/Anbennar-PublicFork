 flavor_grombar.1.t:0 "Of Orcs and Humans"
 flavor_grombar.1.d:0 "With the death of Brasur, the throne of Frozenmaw now passes to his son $MONARCH$, a half-orc. Already, it seems that the chieftains and lords of the realm seek to bring him on their side, for as soon as $MONARCH$ has ascended to the throne, he has a vital choice to make; shall he embrace those reformist chiefs and human lords, seeking to transform the lands of Frozenmaw into a land of peaceful cooperation between orcs and humans? Or shall he bow to the will of the hardliners, establishing a nation for orcs, and orcs alone. It is on this day that the legacy of the Gray Kings will be defined, but it is only $MONARCH$ who can choose what that legacy shall be."

 flavor_grombar.2.d:0 "Following the death of Brasur, already a second claimant to the throne, Garonar, has risen to prominence. Though not technically directly in line for leadership, his claim is in fact stronger than that of $MONARCH$, and being a half-orc, he has far more support from the human population. Given his weak-willed nature, however, $MONARCH$ may well end up simply keeping the throne for themselves. The chieftains, therefore, represent the deciding factor; whoever they support will end up the new leader of Frozenmaw."

 flavor_grombar.3.dh:0 "For the past decades, though we may have been subjugated under the orcish boot, unlike the tales we have heard from the south, these Gray Orcs have ruled with a relatively loose grip, allowing us and our fellow Reachmen to exist in relative autonomy of their domain. As long as we paid our taxes and sent our soldiers, it seemed that the orcs were content to leave us well enough alone.\n\nUntil now, that is.\n\nA messenger from Bal Vroren has arrived, demanding that we integrate our realm into their new kingdom of Grombar. We have been promised positions in the new noble class that has emerged in the kingdom, but no longer will our lands be autonomous. Though we will surely live out the rest of our lives in the splendor we are used to, our time as rulers of our own realm may well come to an end."

It is clear that this is less a request, and much more of a threat. In fact, it has been made clear to us that our choice is between that of slavery or outright death.

 flavor_grombar.4.d:0 "The lands east of the Giant’s Grave have always been rich. Rich in armies, battles, conflict, and war. Yet, they also hold vast potential in resources. Ivory, gold, glass, and of course, furs, are all bountiful in this land, if you know where to look. It appears, however, that our economy stands in a position to make special use of one of these luxury goods, to produce them in such quantity and quality to make the rest of the world tremble with envy. What good shall the next generation of Grombari artisans use to make our lands known across the world?"

 flavor_grombar.5.d:0 "With the last defenders of Gulletpeak falling before the mighty orcish horde, the question of what to do with these goblins now presents itself. For most of orcish history, goblins have served as slaves, but in these times, as we see our southern brothers and sisters placed in chains by the humans, the concept of slavery leaves a bad taste in our mouth. So, two options remain to us; we can either expel the goblins, and make room for proper, orcish settlement, or we can embrace them, as equal partners in our new northern kingdom."

It seems, however, that they have been swallowed up by the ever-growing tide that is the land of the Gray King. Following their expulsion, we now see a train of refugees stretching beyond the horizon, seeking refuge in our lands."

 flavor_grombar.7.d:0 "Though many diplomats and ambassadors regularly pass through our lands, this one is surely one of the most unique. Claiming to be a representative of the Gray King of Grombar, who seeks our help in order to combat the kingdom of Gawed. Though a strange proposal indeed, the prospect is certainly intriguing; having Grombar as an ally would align their powerful armies to our side, and any opportunity to spite the Gawedi is always a welcome one. There are those with concerns, however; the memory of the Greentide is still fresh, mere decades ago, and many believe that the orcs, no matter how our interests may align, are simply too dangerous."

 flavor_grombar.10.d:0 "There is blood along the Alen,\nstreaked across its mighty flow.\nAn amount of pain and hardship,\nthat no orc should ever know.\n\nThe blood is spread by endless ships,\na seemingly endless force.\nThese galleys run by slavers,\nand rowed by mighty orcs.\n\nThey round us up, those slavers,\ninto a parody of a horde.\nThey whip and curse and hate us,\nput our children to the sword.\n\nSo where, you ask, does the Alen flow,\nwhere do these slavers dwell?\nThe frozen wastes far to the north,\nor in the endless fires of hell?\n\nYou would be wrong, for it’s much worse,\nthe land of these slavers is far more grotesque.\nA city of death, of pain, and of suffering,\na city they call Vertesk."

 flavor_grombar.11.d:0 "For centuries, the humans who have lived in these lands believed that the pearls present across Isle Vroren contained the souls of the dead, specifically those slain during the Dragonwake. With the ramping up of production of these pearls, despite some protest from our local human subjects, others still have begun to seek their fortunes on the island, and a miniature ‘pearl-rush’ has begun. Merchants have begun arriving from across Cannor, seeking to buy the pearls at a high price, especially the Corvurians, who seem to take a peculiar interest in the more morbid mythology that surrounds them."

 flavor_grombar.12.t:0 "Ur Sarmozd University"
 flavor_grombar.12.d:0 "In the wake of the Corinite Wars, in 1602, Temar Ironsea would seek to recreate the traditions of learning he had seen whilst on campaign in the west in Grombar. In the city of Ur Sarmond, he would found an university dedicated to the furthering of knowledge in theological, scientific, and arcane fields, as well as serving as a location to record and preserve orcish history. By the mid-17th century, Ur Sarmond would become a renowned center of learning, and one of the most respected in Cannor, with many scholars from the universities of Anbennar making the long journey northwards to both study and learn at the prestigious university."

 flavor_grombar.13.t:0 "Mammoths in their Hall"
 flavor_grombar.13.d:0 "As Grombar expands outwards, into the lands of the far north, we have come across a new, valuable source of income; mammoths. Already, mammoth tusks are fetching high prices both for domestic buyers and foreign merchants, but supply is unable to keep up with demand. A proposal has been made to capture a small group of mammoths, and begin breeding them in Mammoth Hall, as was done centuries ago under the old empire of Castanor. Although expensive, the endeavor promises to pay for itself in the coming years."

 flavor_grombar.14.d:0 "The time has come; vengeance is upon us. In every street, on every corner, the cursed city, so long both hated and feared, is sacked and plundered by our mighty hordes. The endless slave-markets have been destroyed, the former prisoners joining in the slaying of their former masters. The city of slaves, of death and of hate, is no more. In its place now stands a smouldering ruin, a warning to all who would dare participate in the vile slave trade, of what happens to those who think they can put an orc in chains."

 flavor_grombar.15.d:0 "A messenger arrives from Bal Vroren, bringing news of the Gray King’s newest decree; the Reachmen nobility are to take orcish brides, $MONARCH$ included. As vassals, it seems that we have no choice but to accept. We can only hope that the marriages are happy ones, as we draw ever closer to the orcs who call these lands home."

 flavor_grombar.16.d:0 "With the rising of the sun, over the horizon, comes what seems to be a gigantic caravan. Tens of thousands of orcs, new arrivals from the east, with various allegiances to various clans, have arrived in our lands. They bear with them a piece of parchment, signed by the Gray King himself, granting them the right to settle in our lands. Although they take care to profess their loyalty to $MONARCH$, this will undoubtedly continue the process of our realm’s slow loss of autonomy. Nonetheless, however, more subjects will surely be of aid."

 flavor_grombar.17.d:0 "The young lord Crovis of Adshaw has gathered a great host of Alenic mercenaries and adventurers and marched them into our city, proclaiming his ambitious goal of defeating the Gray King and restoring the fallen kingdom of Vrorenmarch. With the blood of the Vrorenssons running through his veins, his claim to the kingdom is valid. He is but a man however, and the orcs now also have legitimate claim to the kingdom. It is clear that Crovis is not planning on leaving the city quietly, and this may be our only chance at freedom, though we shall be forced to face the full fury of the Frozenmaw orcs. Should we accept him and fail, our autonomy will be no more."

 flavor_grombar.18.t:0 "A Visit to Corintar"
 flavor_grombar.18.d:0 "The Gray Orcs find few friends in Escann. The humans despise us simply for being the same species as Dookanson, and our green cousins see us as both traitors and heretics. Ironically enough, however, those who put an end to the Greentide may just be the best chance we have for an ally in the south. Corintar has made the local half-orcs welcome, treating them as equals, and given our brief cooperation in the fight against Dookanson, they may well be open to establishing an alliance between our fledgling nations. Some, however, would rather not open relations with the southerners at all, to prevent a potential show of weakness.\n\nOur half-orc ruler is eager to lead the embassy [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], hoping to have a word with the famous Lothane Bluetusk himself and have personal contact with him. It is risky to send $MONARCH$ into human lands, but if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is guarded by our warriors and pretends to be a simple half-orc mercenary captain, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should be fine.

A group of orc mercenaries hailing from the far north have arrived into our land recently. Their captain asked for a private audience with the famous hero of the Greentide and our leader, $MONARCH$. During this meeting half-orc captain revealed that in reality [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] is none other than Warchief of the Gray Orcs and descendant of Brasur Frozenmaw, leader of the Graytide, and [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] offers Lothane alliance and mutual support.\n\nHaving aided us against their green brethren during our wars with Dookanson, Frozenmaw clan are still orcs, and many of our people still harbor grudges and fears of their kind. If we ally with them, some may say that we are traitors to humankind, but a lot of half-orcs from Grombar may join our clans. Furthermore, the strength of the Gray Orcs shouldn’t be underestimated."

It is obvious to see our diplomatic mission was successful, and these new human delegates assure us that the Corintari will be perfectly happy to establish an alliance.\nOur Warchief and Lothane Bluetusk exchanged a lot of stories about their past. They may not have become friends; however, they are now able to understand each other better, which will positively benefit our relations with the Corintar. Lothane intends to pay a return visit to former Vrorenmarch to see if stories of our Warchief about life in our lands were true.\n\nThough this news is positive, there are still many people in our lands who feel that this was a mistake, and there is spreading unrest over what is perceived by many as a show of weakness by our king. Although kept to a minimum, our realm does admittedly appear weaker on the world stage than it did before. Nonetheless, the Corintar will surely be a useful ally in the years to come."

Though almost certainly a blow to our prestige, it seems we may have actually dodged some large potential unrest."

 flavor_grombar.22.d:0 "For over a century, Grombar was defined by the divide between orcs and humans. All affairs it seemed were at least to some degree split along racial lines, and the lingering distrust between the two groups never seemed to completely fade. In recent years, however, a third group, the half-orcs, have been on the rise. No longer a minority, the half-orcs have reached and surpassed the populations of humans and orcs alike. Every day, it becomes clearer and clearer that ours is no longer a nation of orcs nor humans, but a union of both, and what better symbol of unity than a people born of the two? It is well past time we make it official; Grombar is a land for orc and human alike, and the first place in Cannor that half-orcs can truly call home."

He has already been crowned king of Vrorenmarch in Esald and proclaimed it as his capital, meanwhile our disloyal subjects are gathering under his banner.

The clans grow ever more independent, and the leaders of some have even begun to discuss the possibility of seizure of more power, and perhaps a coup or armed rebellion. In addition, even if these internal threats weren’t present, the simple fact is that as Grombar increasingly urbanises, the continued occupation of lands that could otherwise expand our mighty cities by small, disparate tribes, continues to hold back our ongoing development."

For the first time in decades the White Reachmen stand free and united, liberated by the great Crovis Adshaw. He now stands as one of the greatest heroes of Escann, among the likes of Lothane Bluetusk and has even been compared to Corin herself for his grand deed.

Not only will this ensure their loyalty in the short-term, as they will be unlikely to wish to go against their spouses, in the long-term as well, half-orcs are far more likely to be loyal to our new kingdom than humans.\n\nRefusing these marriages will not be an option."

Brasur rewarded them by executing the lord and instead establishing a mercantile republic. Loyal to the Gray King of course.\n\nIt is time, now, to remind them of the many benefits of our rule.

In fact, due to its central location, it may well serve as a potential new capital for the Gray Kings. But if Garok is to serve a new capital of Grombar it will require a mightier population, and the infrastructure to support it. As such, we will entice orcs from the surrounding lands to move to the city.

However, the city’s buildings are old, and its population is still dominated by humanity. Like we have done in Garok, we will encourage orcish migration to the city, as well as investing vast amounts in revitalising the city’s infrastructure, to create a city that is not just the equal of all others in the Giant’s Grave, but the greatest city in the sea, envy to all others!"

Our lands now serve as home to both orcs and humans, and the place of humans in our new kingdom has already become a subject of great debate.\n\nAlthough none argue for the expulsion of the humans, two camps seem to have emerged. The first talks of the inherent supremacy of orc-kind over humanity, and thus advocates for a state of orcish and half-orcish rule over human subjects. The second, however, advocates for a policy of tolerance, treating the humans of our realm, if not as equals, then as partners.

 Z50_grombari_luxury_goods_desc:0 "Though already we are manufacturing large quantities of goods, for the most part they tend to be of admittedly cheaper make in comparison to their human counterparts, or at least that is the perception amongst foreign merchants. We must endeavor to change this, by dramatically increasing our standards of production. Made in Grombar will soon be synonymous with luxury!"
 Z50_subjugate_rebellious_tribes_title:0 "Subjugate Rebellious Tribes"
 Z50_subjugate_rebellious_tribes_desc:0 "Though the Broken Jaw have been reigned in, many of our kin still refuse to submit themselves to our rightful rule, and even attacking us from their settlements in the east. We must reign them in, bringing them into the domain of the Gray Kings. Of course, as well as further unifying our people, the influx of population combined with their knowledge of the lands further east will make our expansion into the lands north of the Serpentspine all the easier."
 Z50_conquest_of_olavlund_title:0 "Conquest of Olavslund"
 Z50_conquest_of_olavlund_desc:0 "Further north, in the Fjords of the Gerudian Coast, lies Olavslund, home to some of the only fertile farmland in the far north. This alone would be reason enough to seize these lands, but for decades now northern raiders have been terrorising our coasts, attacking in the dead of night, using the tactics of a coward. Now, they will have nowhere to run, no sea to retreat to, no darkness to ambush from. The Olavish will face us head on, and like all who have faced us before, they will surely crumble."
 Z50_no_more_songs_title:0 "No More Songs"
 Z50_no_more_songs_desc:0 "In the far reaches of the Gerudian Coast lies the domain of the Skald-Priests of Skaldskola. For millennia, they have sung meaningless songs to a non-existent god. Worse still, many of their tales directly mock our people, depicting us orcs as a savage, warlike race with no sense of civilization. We will put an end to this mockery for good, as we burn their tales and sing of the foolishness of Gerudians. Who will be laughing then?"
 Z50_control_giants_isles_title:0 "Control the Isles"
 Z50_control_giants_isles_desc:0 "Scattered throughout the Giant’s Grave lie several island chains, most notably the Drowned Giant Isles and the Giant’s Manse. By holding these strategic positions, we will ensure the dominance of Grombar on our seas, and be able to supply our fleets on journeys longer than ever before."
 Z50_naval_base_title:0 "Naval Center"
 Z50_naval_base_desc:0 "The Giant’s Manse lies in the center of the Giant’s Grave, and it can be almost certain that whoever controls it will have a vast advantage over any nation in the region, being able to easily supply fleets and armies across the sea without overstretching supply lines. As such, we shall build up this island into a great naval center like no other, to build up the Gray Fleet to even further heights. It will also surely serve as a potent supply station for the final conquest of the rest of Gerudia."
 Z50_invade_dalr_title:0 "Invade Dalr"
 Z50_invade_dalr_desc:0 "To our west lies the last and mightiest of the Gerudian realms; Bjarnrík. In order to ensure our total dominance of the lands of the north, the bear-kings must be brought to heel. Only then, with the mighty Fjords and Forests of the north under Grombari Command, will we be able to truly call ourselves the lords and protectors of Gerudia. Bjarnrík will come to an end, and so to shall end the days when Gerudians ever thought themselves mightier than orcs."
 Z50_iron_mines_of_dwaroval_title:0 "Iron Mines of Dwaroval"
 Z50_iron_mines_of_dwaroval_desc:0 "Our former home, the Serpentspine, is home to some of the largest deposits of minerals in the known world. Though we do not control any territory within the tunnels themselves, in the lands surrounding the mountains it is easy enough to tap into the vast veins of metal that made the dwarves so rich. Dwaroval seems most suited for the beginning of these extraction operations, with large iron deposits already being discovered there. We’ll steal the dwarves’ riches from right under their noses!"
 Z50_beginning_of_industrialization_title:0 "Beginning of Industrialization"
 Z50_beginning_of_industrialization_desc:0 "More valuable than gold, mithril, or even damestear, coal promises to push the world into a new age of industry and artifice. Across Grombar, coal deposits have been uncovered, and vast furnaces are now being established to power the beginnings of a new age. Long gone are the memories of a desperate group of warriors wandering the northern forests, replaced with the view of a bright future beyond imagination."
 Z50_destroy_ebonfrosts_successors_title:0 "Destroy Ebonfrost's Successors"
 Z50_destroy_ebonfrosts_successors_desc:0 "Once, before the Graytide, in a time the humans call the Era of Black Ice, the Jarldom of Urviksten stood at the head of an empire stretching across all of Escann. Under Castan Ebonfrost, the people of Urviksten almost succeeded in conquering all of Cannor. Now, however, though thoroughly defeated and contained to the eastern reaches of Gerudia, the heirs of Ebonfrost still harbor ambitions of recreating their centuries-old conquests. We must nip this in the bud here and now, and demonstrate that even the mightiest of human warriors are no match for an orc!"
 Z50_colonize_gerudian_coast_title:0 "Colonize Gerudian Coast"
 Z50_colonize_gerudian_coast_desc:0 "To our north lies the untamed land of Giantsmarch, which divides our kingdom from the lands of old Gerudia. This land, though long unclaimed, is of great strategic importance, serving as a potential invasion route both north and south, as well as acting as a potential new port for our growing fleets. Therefore, the local orcs must be brought into the fold of the Gray Kings as soon as possible. After all, if we don’t take it, the Gerudians certainly will."
 Z50_first_orcish_fleet_title:0 "First Orc Fleet"
 Z50_first_orcish_fleet_desc:0 "Though orcs have not had access to the sea for all of our history, let alone a navy, that does not mean we should not build one now. In order to secure the future of the first orcish kingdom, we must ensure that our enemies cannot simply land their armies behind our backs. Rather, we will build the first fleet that orckind has ever seen; a fleet large enough to put those of humanity to shame! For the first orc fleet shall also be the greatest, not just in the Giant’s Grave, but across the world."
 Z50_naval_nation_title:0 "Naval Nation"
 Z50_naval_nation_desc:0 "Having a fleet means nothing if it is at the bottom of the sea. We must ensure that the Gray Fleet is not only the largest in the Giant’s Grave, but able to defeat all our rivals’ fleets combined! Only then will Grombar be truly secure, as the rightful masters of the Giant’s Grave, and all the lands that surround it."
 Z50_colony_in_dalaire_title:0 "Colony in Dalaire"
 Z50_colony_in_dalaire_desc:0 "Far to the west, beyond the ocean, lies Aelantir, the homeland of the elves, ruined like so much else the elves get their hands on. Nonetheless, the lands closest to us present certain opportunities, and a powerbase in Aelantir would certainly be a boon to Grombar in the years to come, both in terms of the economic opportunities of this lost continent, and to keep an eye on the rising elven empires further south."
 Z50_grombari_melting_pot_title:0 "Grombari Melting Pot"
 Z50_grombari_melting_pot_desc:0 "Though for years humans and orcs have been at odds, here in Grombar, our two peoples have come together in one great nation. In the streets of our cities, one can see trade, friendship, and even love blossoming between human and orc. No human or orc is slave to another, and all work together in order to achieve a brighter future."
 Z50_new_faces_of_northmen_title:0 "New faces of Northmen"
 Z50_new_faces_of_northmen_desc:0 "Once, the lands of the north were home to the various realms of humanity; Gerudians, Reachmen, Escanni. Now, however, these peoples have merged into one, along with the gray orcs who now also call the north their home. No longer are our lands those of humans or orcs. Now, when a southerner visits the north, they see a land not of humans or orcs, but of half-orcs, the true heirs to Grombar’s future."
 Z50_brother_countries_title:0 "Brother Countries"
 Z50_brother_countries_desc:0 "Though we are by far the greatest of the half-orc kingdoms, we are by no means alone. Across Escann, and even in Aelantir, new half-orc realms are being established. In order to secure the continued existence of half-orcs on the continent, we must take our half-orc brothers under the protective wing of the kingdom of Grombar."
 Z50_strong_kingdom_policy_title:0 "Strong Kingdom Policy"
 Z50_strong_kingdom_policy_desc:0 "Though some would argue that all races are equally strong in their own way, it is clear to us that orcs and half-orcs are stronger than others. The fact of the matter is that in this world, the strong rule, and the weak are conquered. It just so happens that in every case in Grombar, the strong are orcs, and the weak are everyone else."
 Z50_weak_do_not_live_in_grombar_title:0 "No Home for the Weak"
 Z50_weak_do_not_live_in_grombar_desc:0 "The core lands of Grombar, the center of our kingdom, must be fully settled by the strong. The humans, quite clearly, after all of their lands that we have conquered, are weak. After all, had they not been weak, they would not have been conquered by Grombar in the first place. Thus, it is only right that these lands become home of only the strongest."
 Z50_human_segregation_title:0 "Human Segregation"
 Z50_human_segregation_desc:0 "Humans, being weak, have lost the right to exist alongside orcs in the core of Grombar. This is not cruelty on the Gray King’s part, but rather mercy. By banishing the human population to the cold, harsh regions on the fringes of Grombar, it may well be that the humans will someday become strong enough to rejoin wider orcish society. Who knows, in a few centuries they may even be considered our equals, as ridiculous as that sounds. For now, though, humanity has been segregated from orckind, purely for the betterment of the humans, of course."
