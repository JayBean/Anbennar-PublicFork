 f27_riches_of_the_hills_title:0 "Riches of the Hills"
 f27_riches_of_the_hills_desc:0 "Since time immemorial our eponymous hills have hidden great reserves of wealth, and we, the great roamers of Halann, have sought them. Few queens go without marking their own quarry, and the resources they claim simply fuel further jaunts. It is the nature of our people to be restless, however, and we know there is yet more wealth to be found in our homeland. Our talons will rake the soil a hundredth time, and from its depths bring forth brilliant things."

 f27_humans_of_the_harpy_hills_title:0 "Humans of the Harpy Hills"
 f27_humans_of_the_harpy_hills_desc:0 "Where we harpies move, humans stand. Where we speak, they fall silent. Our nature renders us natural interlocutors, the go-betweens of a hundred peoples, and yet even with our closest neighbours we struggle to find concord. The famed tenacity of these shepherds has long frustrated harpy ambition, but the terror raid has never cowed the Gelkari, merely embittered them. We are the ones who can fly and so we must be the ones to go to them. We must meet them where they are or they will never accept us. Let us make peace and hand them the tools to defend their hilltop towns forever. In so doing, we turn a new page and begin to write a story of alliance, not animosity."

 f27_plains_and_rivers_title:0 "Plains and Rivers"
 f27_plains_and_rivers_desc:0 "For every harvest scratched from the soil of the great Bulwari rivers, enough blood is spilled to replenish it twofold. We soar to power no less eagerly than the hundreds of other despots who have claimed these lands, and yet rulership is an art, practised differently from one craftsman to another. From now onwards, as long as we rule, let the blood run out with the silt; let it diffuse into the Divenhal. The scholars will write that to the greatest of temples, the rule of the harpies brought rest."

 f27_light_and_darkness_title:0 "Light and Darkness"
 f27_light_and_darkness_desc:0 "Centuries and centuries of dispute and feud: here in Inner Bulwar we find great archives of enmity, and familial memories which reach far into the sleet-fogged past. Gnolls and humans have bled one another in unfathomable numbers on these barren rocks, weaving their culture on a loom of mutual hatred. It is a simple thing, to perch in the roost of the Queen and hear their order to mend fences - it is another to actually make such a thing so. We have no choice but to turn our alien nature to our advantage. With a third set of customs, we also bring a third set of laws. The gnolls and humans will be bound equally to it, and their generational feuds formally assessed and resolved by harpy judges. The writing may take centuries, but a new page is begun."

 f27_plight_of_the_rebellion_title:0 "Plight of the Rebellion"
 f27_plight_of_the_rebellion_desc:0 "We harpies have been called deceitful, conniving, underhanded: the truth is that a Harpy Queen sees in every stranger their newest ally, and will dive over collapsing fences of propriety to make it so. Dartaxes and his rebellion of the old believers constitute one such potential ally, and a grateful one at that. They are a militarised populace brimming with resentment, who look upon our Gelkari envoys with far more friendship than the Sun Elves. We do not begrudge them their ancient faith or its practice, and we share enemies. For starters, that may well be enough."

 f27_dartaxes_claims_title:0 "Dartaxes' Claims"
 f27_dartaxes_claims_desc:0 "The exchange of spouses has been achieved; a harpy messenger may now travel unaccosted along the entire width of Bulwar. The smiles shared between our people and the old cultists are still tentative, but we are fellow outcasts in the eyes of the great elven kingdoms and have much bringing us together. Let the western wing unfurl - siblings-in-law will soon give way to cousins, a great imperial family of northern Bulwar. As in a courtship dance, such things need not be rushed."

 f27_bahar_melting_pot_title:0 "Bahar: Melting Pot"
 f27_bahar_melting_pot_desc:0 "Some are wont to call our regard for our human subjects unique: this may be so, given our long intertwining, but it is not absolute. The humans of Bahar foster a profound hostility for the goblins who swept from the Serpentspine, and no lasting harpy peace can exist while this hatred festers. As in all things, the ruler of the skies grants earthly folk dominion over their places: the goblins will have their courts, and so will the humans. It will be difficult to truly resolve such a deeply felt feud, especially given that the old land claims are in living memory, but there can be no half measures in the establishment of a new Harpy queendom. Someday soon, humans and goblins will live peacefully together in Bahar."

 f27_plight_of_the_sadnatu_title:0 "Plight of the Šadnatu"
 f27_plight_of_the_sadnatu_desc:0 "They will say of the harpies that we came at a time of blood, and stopped the flow. We have long noted with alarm the dire situation of the Šadnatu, trapped in constant struggle for independence from the gnolls, and yet the long register of Bulwari history shows us what will happen, should we intervene and allow them their revenge. Quite apart from concerns of mercy, such a revenge will breed only further unrest, and a neverending casus belli against us. These are our terms: the humans of Šad Sur will have their independence, peace and freedom. And there, with their hands on their sword hilts, we will all finally stop. The gnolls will abandon their sacrifice, and both sides will respect the rule of the harpy queens."

 f27_prosperity_after_peace_title:0 "Prosperity After Peace"
 f27_prosperity_after_peace_desc:0 "From our perches, we harpies tend to think of the world as expanses between peaks, long notes followed by rests. As the mountains of the Šadnatu have fallen under the queen’s peace, the economy has boomed, stability encouraging investment in its mineral reserves. Harpy logistics corps bring goods in and out in unprecedented volume, and the shattered infrastructure is slowly repaired. The arguments for a roost in Šad Sur are thus manifold: It is a natural administrative centre in the south, a place from which to pincer the Bulwari river plain in times of war. It is also a place of ancient history and prestige, and perhaps most importantly a proof of concept for the queen’s justice. Ours is the benevolent imperium of the skies. If we look down on our subjects, it is only because we have dared to fly."

 f27_raise_the_flocks_title:0 "Raise the Flocks"
 f27_raise_the_flocks_desc:0 "It is the fault of the parent if the children bicker, and above all our minor flocks have lacked purpose. Life, the matriarch wonders, must be about more than access to an aquifer. Lowlanders rarely understand the hidden pride of the matriarch, which can ignore the slander of outsiders but which takes extreme umbrage at the passing comment of a fellow harpy. Here in the sky we have perched among ourselves, and scratched ceaselessly at each other. No longer. Ayarallen will fly once more in formation, and our wings will blot out the sun."

 f27_queen_of_the_hills_title:0 "Queen of the Hills"
 f27_queen_of_the_hills_desc:0 "To take flight without a solid nest is madness: a simple wisdom to which we harpies more easily agree than adhere, so used as we are to our endless peregrinations. It is difficult to keep a bevy of matriarchs together and focused on a single goal, let alone over generations, and so what we have built in these highlands is all the more remarkable. Our roosts are peaceful and functional, unburdened by the internecine conflict of daughters, our discourse in the perch of the queen respectful and productive. Our talons are sharp and pointed where they should be; towards wider Bulwar, and the destiny of Ayarallen."

 f27_queendom_of_bulwar_title:0 "Queendom of Bulwar"
 f27_queendom_of_bulwar_desc:0 "Until now, we have been a claimant, one of many with ambitions to reunify Bulwar for the umpteenth time in its venerable history. Such claimants must prove their right to every inch of territory, and our envoys have flocked to every court from the Dameshead to Rahen, dissembling our ambition while quietly proving our mettle. We tiptoe no longer. Serpentspine to Divenhal, all Bulwar is in the shadow of harpy wings. What remains is simply to subjugate the river cities, making our will manifest."

 f27_the_city_of_cities_title:0 "The City of Cities"
 f27_the_city_of_cities_desc:0 "The city of Bulwar, from which an entire continent takes its name, is for us most notably a city of the lowlands. It is the lilypad on the pond, the place where a courier can land and rest before continuing south. But it is also a city of almost unfathomable ancientness, scuffed here and there from rounds of invasion, civil unrest and flooding. The benevolent rule of the Queen will see this city remade once more as a lily on the pond, the Lowest Perch of the harpy state."

 f27_bulwari_metropol_title:0 "Bulwari Metropol"
 f27_bulwari_metropol_desc:0 "The grebe settles on the water and adjusts its feathers - it seeks a tranquil lake on which to do so. The existing, ancient metropolises of the riverland make ideal perches, and we will restore and invest in these great cities, for the benefit of our human subjects and our pocketbooks alike. An adapted Roost model is suited to the Bulwari riverlands: it is a flat land stretching between fixed strongpoints, and the openness and mildness of the terrain is a force multiplier for our existing logistical strengths. It is not merely the ancient cities of Bulwar which will benefit from such investment, however. The ancient capital at Heunthume will be repaired, reorganised and expanded. Its four great levels will breathe again, a Highest Perch of all peoples."

 f27_the_fourth_and_final_queendom_title:0 "The Fourth and Final Queendom"
 f27_the_fourth_and_final_queendom_desc:0 "If there is a great mistake of harpy rule, it is an extension of our long history of elite consultation; matriarchs feel free to speak back to the Queen in the safety of the council, and every harpy of any renown maintains their own magisterial air. Such able satraps readily envision themselves as independent rulers. If we seek to maintain this grand harpy confederation we have built, we must establish a Queen among Queens, a court of grandeur, the authority and majesty of which are final and unquestionable."

 f27_the_royal_hunters_title:0 "The Royal Hunters"
 f27_the_royal_hunters_desc:0 "The fractious and warlike harpies of Nansalen draw their consorts by long tradition from the people of Akalšes, stymied only by contested dominion over the region and by the hostility of its elven rulers. We have made a claim to real hegemony over the harpies, and we more than most know that a Matriarch demands proof of the value of an exchange before she accedes to it. Let us bind the Nansalen to us by the greatest of debts - that of the village matchmaker. Nansalen shall have their husbands, and we shall have their loyalty."

 f27_stewardess_of_the_suran_title:0 "Stewardess of the Suran"
 f27_stewardess_of_the_suran_desc:0 "Mages have long been known for sacrificing the craft of good governance to their own priorities. The mages of Varamhar have treated the upper Suran as their personal laboratory, at the cost of the thousands of tenant farmers who make their cosseted lives possible. Such abrogation of their duty of care is abominable to the Queen. Though we already sought to project our influence across all Bulwar, the excesses of these mage-potentates grants us powerful added incentive and a useful casus belli."

 f27_governorship_of_setadazar_title:0 "Governorship of Setadazar"
 f27_governorship_of_setadazar_desc:0 "The blessing of Bulwar is a rich and ancient trove of history. Its greatest vice is nostalgia. None personify this fault better than the plaintive nobility of Sareyand, who have yoked the Setadazari to their endless lust for lost glory, squandering wealth and lives on a dream which is already dead. We harpies, while cognizant of our past triumphs, know that the wind ever changes. We will offer Setadazar a future that is genuinely novel, a model of life under which the Queen’s peace brings prosperity and progress."

 f27_partition_of_irrliam_title:0 "Partition of Irrliam"
 f27_partition_of_irrliam_desc:0 "We should not be surprised that the sun elves have gripped hard to their hegemony over Bulwar since the collapse of the Phoenix Empire. The realm of Taelarios claims leadership in this, and it is with some justice that our fiercer matriarchs see men like him as the cause of many of our worst misfortunes. It is the most conservative element of the New Sun Cult clergy who have championed great raids against our people. In a hundred rural temples, they make monsters of us to their congregations. We do not wish to break the Bulwari way of life, for humans or for elves, but we will not leave in place a structure which threatens us. Irrliam and the temporal power of its priesthood must be crushed and scattered like seed. We dispose of such prizes as we will."

 f27_suran_under_wing_title:0 "Suran Under Wing"
 f27_suran_under_wing_desc:0 "We fly over a ribbon of turquoise, trimmed in mint and moss and chartreuse. Beyond is ochre, yellow and white. In places the ribbon tears, its scattered fabrics littering the emptiness. Thirty minutes do not pass before one again comes across a great geometric growth reaching out from the ribbon, flanking the turquoise in great studded wings of mud-brown. Here and there, deep jade and forest green speckle the feathers - the famous gardens of the Bulwari. Even now, landing towers and skytaverns shoot up at the centre of Bulwari market towns, linking the source of the Suran to its mouth so seamlessly that our strongest fliers can make the trip alone in under a week. It is said that sovereigns rule over their lands. We will make this unusually literal."

 f27_the_odd_hunters_title:0 "The Odd Hunters"
 f27_the_odd_hunters_desc:0 "We have feuded with the Hytiranyalen since long before their expulsion east by the hated Beastbane. Among ourselves, we sourly jest that the worst of his crimes was sticking us with this most baffling and irritant of flocks. The Queen’s vision sees beyond petty rivalry, however, to a future greater than pride. Thus the matriarchs of Hytiranlen were taken at their word when they mockingly demanded the city of knowledge itself. The joke will be on them, however. Aqatbar is no mere scholar’s garden; it is a path to the Divenhal and a difficult place to manage. Let these odd ducks rifle through their tomes, so long as they open the west for our queen."

 f27_harpys_road_title:0 "Harpies Road"
 f27_harpys_road_desc:0 "Since the opening of the archives of Aqatbar, the Hytiranyalen have delved eagerly and deeply into its reserves of knowledge, more and more of their senior matriarchs taking up permanent residence in spires close to the library itself. From such hallowed halls flow new ideas of governance and statecraft, new standards, new imperatives. The matriarchs are arguing that no true Harpy governance can flourish without a network of rest towers, without proper roads for our human freight caravans, without the adoption of standard weights and measures. No longer will the harpy lands be Bulwar’s backwater; from the Serpentspine to the Divenhal, the Queen’s peace will guarantee wealth."

 f27_links_to_the_north_and_east_title:0 "Links to the North and East"
 f27_links_to_the_north_and_east_desc:0 "We are people of the open sky, who nest by the mountains. Projecting power east over the Serpentspine is a pointless endeavour that would land us in neverending conflict with the Centaurs while stranding us far from home. The Serpentspine’s caves promise only claustrophobic misery and yet more death. Even the forests of the north offer only a sea of endless green in which to drown. No, these places are best appeased, by the greatest harpy diplomacy we can bring to bear. Goods, services, people, ideas; we will open to them all, and in doing so render ourselves all the richer."

 f27_the_first_of_the_temples_title:0 "The First of the Temples"
 f27_the_first_of_the_temples_desc:0 "It will be said that we harpies scorned the desert and brought order where even Surael’s chosen could not. Here in the holiest place in Bulwar, we send a message manifold and subtle in its variations. To our human and elven subjects, we assert ourselves as the only competent guardians of their ancient religious treasures. Jaddar and Zokka we denounce as petty warlords, fit only to spill blood where our Queen builds peace. The harpy spires at Eduz Vacyn will be the grandest ever seen, a record of our victory."

 f27_the_bulwari_under_wing_title:0 "The Bulwari Under Wing"
 f27_the_bulwari_under_wing_desc:0 "Even the most idealistic Harpy Queen must forgive their human subjects a little cynicism - the Bulwari, after all, have had one alien conqueror after another wash over them. Such conquerors have enslaved, patronised, enraptured, laid waste; resistance was thus to be expected when we swept in. No ruler of Bulwar has ever offered autonomy in the manner we have, however. The participation of humanity in the project of Harpylen is no platitude. Humans rise to genuine political influence with greater frequency than under any previous Bulwari administration, and disproportionately thrive in our officer corps and civil service. For Cannorians, Escanni, and Raheni alike, the face we show the world is now as often human as it is harpy - by design, of course."

 f27_many_ports_many_people_title:0 "Many Ports, Many People"
 f27_many_ports_many_people_desc:0 "Our human clerks know western Bahar well: it is a craggy outcrop which prefers the ferry to the cart, and which has been much assailed by revolution, struggle and invasion. But it is also a place of tragedy for we harpies, the peninsula from which the Hytiranyalen flock were once driven by the cruelties of Castan II Beastbane. Ovdal Tûngr, Crathano, Bal Ouord and Re-Uyel are as such barely foreign cities to us, tightly bound to the economic fortunes of the Bulwari Main and with great meaning for many of our people. Let us bring the Bahari in from the cold, and guard our western door even as we make new paths to the sea."

 f27_monsters_no_more_title:0 "Monsters no More"
 f27_monsters_no_more_desc:0 "Monstrousness is a question of perspective, and a question of tradition. What the Bulwari have been wont to call monstrous is related more to administration and organisation than true nature. We harpies, so often cast as the villains of bedtime stories, know this only too well. There are two true monsters left in the fairytale pages of the Salahad: the gnoll slavers, and our Siadunan sisters to the east. We will bring them under our sway and prove that old drawing room retort - civilisation is simply what happens when one learns to pay one’s taxes."

 f27_twin_rivers_bounty_title:0 "Twin Rivers Bounty"
 f27_twin_rivers_bounty_desc:0 "It is the harpy way to connect things. We move between spaces, filling them, mapping them. Is it so strange, then, that we seek to bring the same to our subjects? Humans believe that the key to prosperity is ambition, elves claim tradition, goblins cunning, gnomes technology; they are all wrong. Prosperity is logistics. Under Harpylen, the great arterial rivers of Bulwar have become superhighways for goods. Harpy couriers and entrepreneurs flit from city to city, resting in well-maintained skytaverns which now mark the horizon in every town for a thousand miles. Complex chains of industrial production are rendered trivial by fast-moving barges, human-manned delivery carpets and vertically integrated regional exchange hubs. Once we made great capitals of our roosts; now every town of Bulwar is such a roost."

 f27_the_matter_of_faith_title:0 "The Matter of Faith"
 f27_the_matter_of_faith_desc:0 "We call ourselves peacemakers, yet with our sovereignty over all-Bulwar, still the question of confession remains. As we struggled to unify the Harpy Hills, we brought the old believers into our alliance; since then, we have conquered great swathes of Bulwari territory, dethroned the sun elves and denied Jaddar his claimed destiny. Yet still the people roil and fight. There is nothing to be done but to call a conclave of our own, settle the debate and establish a religious settlement along the Twin Rivers."

 f27_twin_rivers_enlightenment_title:0 "Twin Rivers Enlightenment"
 f27_twin_rivers_enlightenment_desc:0 "We have been accused of mercenary faith, as if to value consensus and tolerance is a vice. The work of Surael is in the mending, and in our compromise position we have healed the worst scars of Bulwari religious discord, uniting the people in reverence. The Queen’s peace is not merely the absence of war; it is the harmony we see now, spreading out from the Suran and Baranun like the life-giving floods of spring."

 flavour_ayarallen.1.d:0 "It was in the upper spice market that the most furious argument raged. It was early enough that the smell of Kasiyaru had not yet completely pervaded the courtyard. The shadow of a harpy passing overhead made a few men blanch, but it did not end the discussion.\n\n'My ancestors will spit on me if we accept this, Eni…' said Arakh. His head shook with enough force to make his entire rotund body quiver.\n'You will be alive to be spat on!' Eni stood up again, storming over to his stall to pretend to tidy his display.\n\n'As a coward! As a gnoll lover!' Arakh followed him, almost pleading. 'They will walk through these streets, Eni! Will you sell them the kasi? Will you look one of those things in the muzzle like a customer?'\n'I will be alive to do so,' Eni repeated, fervent.\n'You will be a slave to harpy and gnoll both.' Arakh spat onto the ground.\n'That’s not true,' Eni said. 'They intend to reinstate the Akalate. The whole Akalate'\n\nArakh laughed. “More propaganda. Even if they do, what is an Akal who kneels to a harpy?”\n\nEni was a small man, but to his credit, he stared his friend down. 'A living one.'"

It blew towards the Twin Rivers, and all present smiled at the omen.\n\nTeisi spilled over their stool, huffing and puffing as they rearranged documents. They had already been forced to slam their palm down hard on a flyaway document or two. "We prefer to fly in a month or two, once sufficient livestock can be-"\n\n[F80.Monarch.GetName] scoffed.

It was, contrary to appearances, a promising sign. They were all independently motivated, and all saw profit in the venture.

Here in Heunthume one generally heard no anger, only tittering disdain - the laughter behind the wing. Enarios felt no fear, however. He was valuable to the Queen for his honesty.\n\n"Your Grace, it is a question of legitimacy. Of whether one can keep what one conquers. Of whether it will be allowed to remain so." He had the privilege of sitting rather than standing in his queen’s presence, though since he had reached three hundred and fifty, this was more necessity than luxury. His legs were stiff and aching, and he rarely left the royal compound. He shifted, and the thick blanket on his lap slipped from one of his legs. One of the Queen’s maids rushed to replace it, and he smiled in thanks.\n\n"We believe that is no longer relevant, given our strength and breadth," replied the Queen. Their expression was severe. "And we believe there are costs to humility."\n\nEnarios conceded this with a nod. "Then forgive me the impertinence of a warning."\n"Always."\n"You must take no half-measures. Even if, for the moment, you look only upon a city or two, you must claim the whole prize. You cannot prove your sovereignty over Bulwar before you have shown the requisite arrogance to claim it."

At the edge of a forest of laundry they perched, enjoying the wind-wafted scent and watching their city, greatest and most ancient of the continent, fall.\n\n“My parents want me to go early,” Hazi said, quite abruptly, after a while.\n\n“Because of this?” Atya frowned. There had been no great inferno sweeping through the city, at least not yet. The only change on their horizon was the tower. It was just a scaffold now, but it crept further upwards by the day.\n\n“They think the elves will fight.” Hazi fiddled with her braid, her legs swinging idly over the lip of the roof. She still had all the affectations of a little girl. Atya suddenly wanted to shake her.\n\n“With what army?” Atya scoffed. “You argued with them, right?”\n\nHazi stared at her. “They’re my parents.”\n\nAtya opened her mouth to speak, but a sound like rustling wind made her wheel around in her seated position. Another patrol of harpy enforcers was passing overhead. Even if she had been the type to take her country’s causes as her own, it was hard not to gape when they flew in formation. From the roof, she could pick out the patterns in the soldiers’ feathers, each different from the next.\n\n“I’ll send letters,” Hazi said, finally. “If everything’s good here, it won’t matter. They said I can come back, that we’ll talk later about the temple.” Hazi’s eyes were shining. Atya did not want her to cry.\n\n“Yeah.” Atya forced a smile. “We’ll write, it’ll be fun.

 flavour_ayarallen.6.t:0 "The Proclamation of Harpylen"
 flavour_ayarallen.6.d:0 "Zakiti could barely move. The akhte on her head was surprisingly heavy, its tassels and bells ringing with every step. She had seen the delicacy with which her minder and maid for the week had settled the heavy patterned stole over her shoulders, and she was trying to keep her posture rigid to avoid displacing it. An immense silver necklace of six chains, studded with every gem to be found in Gelkalis, hung almost to her waist; she had never before worn jewellery heavy enough to really feel.\n\nHeunthume had been freezing thus far, battered daily by winds even fiercer than in her home village, but between the akhte and the four or five layers she was wearing, she found herself sweating profusely long before they even approached the parade route. She had never seen so many harpies in one place. For her, harpies came in ones or twos at most: to inform the town council of new ordinances, or to requisition the tower for a night.\n\nAs the first and most treasured of the harpy subject nations, her delegation led the column, and she felt the automatic smile spring to her lips, the same smile that had won her this chance in the first place. She was Gelkalis personified, a real life shepherd girl bedecked in finery she was likely never to see again. Still, it was something to be loudly cheered, to see little harpy girls gaze up at her in admiration. There were moments on the route when she felt like what she was claiming to be - the embodiment of Gelkalis itself, the woman of the hills.\n\n“First Client of Harpylen, the Human Realm of Gelkalis!” They had reached a large open plaza, right at the base of the immense steps which led to the higher levels of Heunthume. Zakiti blinked. Harpies did not need stairs, of course. The steps were for everyone else, to exhaust themselves on the way up.\n\nHer smile remained still, perhaps a little mysterious. Her people did not beam like salt merchants, desperate and ingratiating; they kept the secrets they were told. A harpy attendant took her hand and brought her before the Queen.\n\nIt took effort not to gape. The tip of every one of the Queen’s feathers had been painted. A riot of reds, oranges, yellows and golds quivered with each of her movements. A profusion of taffeta and organza spilled over the flagstone, licked into frothing waves by the wind. As the processional column approached, the Queen spread her wings, and here at the base of Heunthume she resembled nothing less than the rising sun.\n\n“Gelkalis, first and most loyal friend,” she said, with genuine warmth. Zakiti remembered her choreography, as automatic as a circle dance. She bowed, and the Queen gallantly took her hand to kiss. The harpies loved ironies like this, thought Zakiti, as she waved airily at the crowd and tried to ignore her stiffening neck. They brought you to their capital to pay obeisance, only to play at gallantry."

From here, you only had to get through the buttery and across the servant’s courtyard to reach the main tower, but the harpies would not need to scamper across the ground like rats. It was enough to get them inside the shield bubble.\n\nHe pulled open the door to the dining hall and stood well back. A stream of harpy warriors flowed past him and launched into the air, one by one and with utter discipline. They made no more sound than wind, even in their armour. He waited only until the last soldier was airborne, and then he ran. He barely registered the tile floor under his bare feet; he imagined he was flying across it, like the harpies did. \n\nThe stash was at the back of one of the fuel rooms, hidden in a crate under a drop cloth. The kitchen boys knew his iron hand too well to ever look without permission, and it was too risky to keep this stuff in any place overtly associated with himself. He counted off a battered brass compass, a week or two in coins, travelling boots, a plain mint-green tunic and robe, dried meat jerky, hardtack, and the greatest of his prizes: a speaking stone. He had taken it from the chamber of a doddering old scholar called Ahalios, who lost things at the best of times. He had even helped look for it.\n\nHe was out of the main building in minutes. The night was still silent, the vault of the sky new-moon black but for a spray of stars. On a normal night he would have looked upon it from his window and seen it blurred, distorted by the soft hum of the bubble. Tonight, it was sharp and perfect and clear, a million silver studs in a velvet jacket. He fished the speaking stone from his pack and made the motions, feeling the now-familiar, still-illicit rush. He spoke softly into its glow.\n\n“They are inside, general. Going dark until Heunthume.” \n\nThe elves always thought that to forbid something was to make it impossible. He knew that they would invent some great conspiracy to explain this - he counted on it as his cover. The simple truth was that, as he had turned the stone over and over in his little steward’s cell, he had felt the strange rush of power, his magic. And when, playing around, he had reached from the stone and felt a new and strange connection, the harpy on the other end had said something that no mage had ever said to him before:\n\n“What is your name?”\n\nHe reached the crest of the hill just as faint booms and crashes began to carry from the tower. He could sense the now familiar hum of magic, and the little spots of silence where the harpies snuffed it out.\n\n“I am Idirammi,” he murmured to himself, and smiled."

Yadri’s voice kept up with his quick, jerking steps; he fired his words rather than spoke them.\n\n“This space is being used for deliberation at the moment.” He indicated a large oval table. “But we can clear all that out, turn it back into bedchambers if you prefer. It was a spiteful choice in the first place.”\n\nThe harpy’s hand went up. She had done that a couple of times already; it was annoying, like the sign one made at a waiter. “No. Useful this way.” She insisted on wearing her armour everywhere, which Yadri knew had to be making her miserable in the summer heat.\n\n“This was the local governor’s?” she asked, as they moved into a central courtyard brocaded in vibrant greens. Only the pool at the centre felt direct sunlight; beyond the colonnades, a huge desert juniper cast its shadow across much of the open space. Yadri blinked a little at the harshness of her tone.\n\n“Yes. We have turned it into a suite of offices.”\n\n“Good,” she said. “Government should be prestigious.”\n\nYadri was long used to keeping his face neutral in the presence of his betters, but that almost got him. He had mentally resigned himself to the loss of this beautiful place, the end of this happy period between one master and the next. All that harpy rhetoric about self-rule seemed pretty transparent.\n\n“We will need to begin a levy for a spire,” she said, and he nodded, scratching another item into his wax. Of course. The harpies had no need for the pleasures of the sunken garden; their servants would raise them high instead. But Yadri couldn’t help noticing that this would get them firmly out of the way."

The windows had been thrown open to make the human envoys uncomfortable, but to their credit they had arrived in heavy layers laden in gold brocade. As ever in such things a leader had emerged, a young woman from the city of Bulwar itself. She had long, long hair, bound by silver rings in a great flow down her back; it was the image of formidable womanhood, an ancient queen displaced through time into an upstart city council.\n\n“You harpies forget that we have long known the rule of others, and seem to believe you have devised convincing platitudes the elves have not. This is a profound underestimation of elven pretension,” said the woman, whose name was Talkora. “We have not arrived to negotiate, but to present our position with clarity, in the only tone sovereigns respect.” She drew herself up. If she was intimidated in a room full of harpies, some armed, she did not show it.\n\n“In sweeping away Bulwari rule of the riverlands, you have made good use of our natural claim to this place. With it you have smashed your enemies, and good for you.” The dismissive wave of her hand made even a few of the harpy attendants titter. “In response, we present you with a choice. Recognise the ancient rights of the city which even your predecessors have understood and respected, or be identified and recognised as mere warmongers, another springtide flood down the Suran and Baranun.”\n\nTalkora did not wait for an answer. This was the presentation of an ultimatum, not a true negotiation. As she swept out of the chamber with her attendants in tow, it was hard not to be reminded of a harpy matriarch."

He had spent his entire life wading among these plants. His family’s farmhouse was the only interruption on the horizon, though from its roof you could just about see the Nawiris’ compound walls.\n\nThere was little work left for him. His sisters and mother had left for market, and his father was out somewhere in the village, likely drinking. Instead, Letu lay down in one of the furrows between the neatly planted bushes and felt the familiar pulse, the network of water in the soil. With the instinctual self-preservation of youth, he had known that it was imperative not to tell anyone about the pulse - it was alien, and corresponded not at all to anything his parents had ever said.\n\nInstead, he had nurtured his little secret, and every time he lay here, he urged the water through its million veins, as if the whole field were one organ, one body. He could spend whole afternoons at this - it was like being on the edge of the crowd at solstice, tipsy and euphoric. It was as though every plant had a mind, or something like a mind. A few weeks ago, four year-old Yami Nawiri had trodden through the lentils and crushed one of the bushes, and for a second Letu had thought he might kill her.\n\nSo lost was he in the great lentil network beneath the soil that he entirely ignored the beating of wings, the soft thump as the harpy landed. He heard it, of course, but such things seemed irrelevant.\n\n“You’re not subtle,” said the harpy. When Letu opened his eyes, he saw she was holding a great quarterstaff. He had never seen a harpy before - he had imagined them shorter somehow, or squat like crows. He retracted himself from the lentil mind and regarded her.\n\n“Not subtle with what?” he asked. He noticed the tension in the harpy’s body, coiled yet idle, like an angry drunk. \n\n“Your magic,” said the harpy, staring, and in a moment Letu’s life was changed."

In her first years as an acolyte, her cell had directly overlooked one of the Greeting Courtyards, where those who had pledged their lives to the temple would await the sun on the days when they were not leading public prayer. She would doze off in the dead of night and wake with her temples throbbing, choking on the smell. She considered it powerful evidence for her iron discipline that she hadn’t fucked off to run a winery.\n\nEven now she was used to being held in cheerful contempt by the true holinesses of the Vacyntassi high temples. Kairete was a mundane woman, her mind firmly closed to the higher mysteries. She had been shoved sideways again and again into rote administrative positions, until she found herself High Bursar, Grand Vizier of the account books, She-Who-Says-No-To-A-New-Solarium.\n\nThe second the harpies had made it over the city walls, the real priests had fled into their chambers and left her to negotiate with the occupation.\n\n“Well, you might as well level the city if you do that,” she said, massaging her forehead.\n\nThe general blinked at her. “I’m sorry?”\n\nKairete sighed. “Incense tax revenue is kept by the temples, because it’s lucrative and funds them. It’s the basis of my budget. It also has religious importance. You’d be pissing off the venal and the zealous all at once, and for the first time in several hundred years you’d unite the merchants with the priests. Stupid.”\n\nThe harpy general seemed to regard her. “It would benefit you to show more respect.”\n\nKairete scoffed. “I spend all of my time arguing with the most ancient elven priesthood in Bulwar. You represent at most the fourth biggest ego in this building. Without me, you will spend weeks trying to resolve accounts with senile eremites who last worried about how breakfast gets onto the table over a century ago. Take my advice or don’t, imprison me or don’t, kill me or don’t.” She reached for another thick tome, dropping it onto the table with a loud bang.\n\n“Now, property distribution.

When the two of them flew together, Hani bound it roughly with a band, but the wind still caught it everywhere.\n\n“Wings versus magic is ridiculous,” Taf said, picking at an awkward feather with their talon. “You can just juice it and win. Or you throttle yourself and it’s pointless.”\n\n“Then ride with me.” Hani had that look in her eye again. Daring.\n\n“Absolutely not, I hate those things. I could just carry you.”\nHani laughed. “If you want my mother to shoot you out of the sky, sure.”\n\nIn the end they did as they always did, Taf keeping an idle gliding pace while Hani stretched out on her carpet. Hani had been flying since she was a child, and the magic was second nature, but that didn’t stop Taf from starting slightly every time Hani peered over the side or abruptly dropped a few metres.\n\nThey flew for a good hour over Hani’s mother’s land, an intensely cultivated strip of green with a great scrubland at its back. The scrubland was no less carefully managed; only from on high could you see the endless, quasi-hexagonal pattern in which the khadit trees had been planted. They wept a sweet pink sap which the grovers allowed to harden in the sun; it was a popular candy.\n\nFor all that Taf fretted, their eyes flittering from the heiress to the ground and back, this was Hani’s little queendom. Rolling hills that to others were indistinguishable were landmarks for her; she flew and dove and roamed this place, refining her strange, runabout magic. She was a haughty, nouveau-riche little shit who felt at home everywhere she walked. This included the houses of her mother’s workers, whom she knew largely by name - an achievement, given there were over a hundred of them. With the march of years she had become something like a mascot, a roaming demon of the farms.\n\nThey settled on the roof of a small grover’s cottage, the terracotta warm under the afternoon sun. Taf waited a polite twenty seconds.\n\n“We still have to go over nomenclature.”\nHani had closed her eyes and was showing all of the classic signs of ignoring them completely, so Taf grabbed her carpet and sat on it.\n\n“For the purposes of the event, you are -” Taf’s mouth twisted at the translation, but it was the closest possible - “a niece. Please recite how you would refer to aunts of orders one through eight.”\n\nThe heiress gave a long-suffering sigh, and began."

Hotter heads are prevailing there.”\n\nThe Queen nodded. “How hot?”\n\n“My half-sister regards themself as a modern Atyaneh.

That had been done outside. The envoy, weighed down by tears soon to be shed, climbed from the very lowest tier of Heunthume, announcing their intent. Once at the palace, nothing more was to be said. The envoy simply approached the throne, and passed over the declaration.
