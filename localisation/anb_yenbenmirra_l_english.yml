 yenbenmirra_tribe:0 "Yenbenmirra Tribe"
 yenbenmirra_tribe_desc:0 "Guarding the lowlands from the spread of hinuiflora and fauna, the Yenbenmirra have been moving across the jungles of west Insyaa and conducting ritual burnings of any stray piece of hinuiflora that enters their lands. Though often dangerous, these burnings hold great religious and societal importance, and any tribe not doing their due dilligence in containing the spread of dangerous flora and fauna is considered to have failed both their people and the land itself."
 yenbemirra_leaders_of_fire:0 "Leaders of Fire"
 yenbemirra_leaders_of_fire_desc:0 "With thousands of Children of Fire in our tribe, we feel closer than ever to our dream. Yet this old method of migrating our home no longer makes sense. Set up a permanent capital, send our people with the supplies needed to combat the spread of the hinuiflora and fauna, and come back with more Children of Fire."
 yenbenmirra_cultivate_the_lowland:0 "Cultivate the Lowland"
 yenbenmirra_cultivate_the_lowland_desc:0 "Now that we have abandoned our migratory ways, it's time to change how we approach the lands we call home. Plant seeds, till the soil, divert water from the rivers, flood the plains. Take every skill we have passed down through our words and memories and let us take control of this land the Goddess has given us."

 bomowoka_nation_title:0 "Awaken the Children of Fire"
 bomowoka_nation_desc:0 "We are ready. We have the knowledge. We have the power. We, the Children of Water, have gathered an army of Children of Fire. When they awaken, they shall awaken amongst their comrades. They shall see that we are prepared to lead them in retaking all that the Goddess made us.

 yenbenmirra.3.t:0 "Collect the Children of Fire"
 yenbenmirra.3.d:0 "Across the lowlands lie our sleeping breatheren. When the goddess made us, the Children of Water, she also made the Children of Fire. They were supposed to fight by us. And yet they sleep, for neither we nor they were ready to take the fight to the jungle.\n\nWhen they next awaken, they must see that they are not alone. We will gather them all in one place - a long and tiring process for sure, but one that must be done."
 yenbenmirra.3.a:0 "Gather the Children of Fire"
 yenbenmirra.3.b:0 "Never Mind"

 yenbenmirra.4.t:0 "The Children of Fire"
 yenbenmirra.4.d:0 "Our grandparents shared with us a story. They were there when the Children of Fire awoke. These people, hewn from metal, lay asleep across the lowlands. We knew the Goddess had a plan for them, but we were not ready. When they awoke, they looked at what we had built, saw they were alone, and knew they could never retake Insyaa at this time. So back into their long slumber they fell.\n\nFor decades the mystery of why they fell back asleep evaded us. But in the past decade, many amongst the Yenbenmirra feel they knew the answer. They saw they were alone, so we must put them all together. Collect the Children of Fire from across the lowlands, so that when they awaken, they will see their comrades.\n\nWe must continue our sacred task of burning all invasive hinuiflora and fauna to keep our people and this land safe. But while we do so, we will have a second task: Collect all of the Children of Fire. And when they awaken, we will be the ones to lead them to retake Insyaa!"

 yenbenmirra.7.t:0 "Our Children of Fire Collection Grows"
 yenbenmirra.7.d:0 "As the sun rises overhead, it glints over an army of sleeping Children of Fire, all sitting side-by-side, awaiting the day they wake together. The collection has grown so large, it has become an immense operation to move them. Perhaps we should think about setting up a permanent home for our people?"
 yenbenmirra.7.a:0 "A permanent home eh?"

 yenbenmirra.8.t:0 "Disaster!"
 yenbenmirra.8.d:0 "They have taken our Children of Fire!"
