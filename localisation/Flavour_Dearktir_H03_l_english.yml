 dearktir_hold_billel_desc:0 "For uncounted years the Dukad of Dearktir has held claim to the island of Billel, although it was deemed hardly worth it to administer the near-barren island. In 1432 Carodir Strongarm made efforts to populate and fortify the island, also implementing strict trade laws forcing merchants en route to Murdkather to pay fees. Murdkather understandably is threatened by this and seeks to end our hold over Billel and the trade fees: we must continue Carodir's efforts and erect a mighty fortress to protect our interests."

 dearktir_eclipse_murdkather_desc:0 "Now that Billel is fortified and secured, our control over the Elarbarc has been strengthened. Murdkather remains the shining jewel of the Summer Court, with Dearktir in its shadow. We must endeavour to improve, develop, and beautify our city at least as an equal of Murdkather, if not grander. All will speak of Dearktir as the grandest port in all of Eordand!"
