 U07_forlon_pack_desc:0 "After our disastrous confrontation with Grizaka under the walls of Kheterata, Viakkoc XI led our pack northwards, hoping to regain our glory in the lands of the Akasik, ripe for the taking. Marching thousands of miles through the sands, we came across the pack of Brrtekuh – demoralised and disorganised following their pack mistress’ unfortunate injury, they were a pitiful sight, but the decision of their lieutenants to let us through their territory without incident has not been forgotten.\n\nFollowing our recent victory together in the war against Kheterata – one in which our greater strength seemed greatly understood by our allies – many amongst us now believe that it is our duty to take this forlorn pack under our permanent protection."

 U07_beyond_cape_abada_title:0 "Beyond Cape Abada"
 U07_beyond_cape_abada_desc:0 "Our position at the north-eastern tip of Sarhal is a very advantageous one. We stand at the crossroads of Sarhal and Cannor, a fine position for raiding ships travelling between the two continents. However, it is clear that if we are to further our position – and our riches – then we must invest much more into exploration and conquest beyond Cape Abada, into the wealthy but fractured lands of south-west Sarhal. In order to do this, it is imperative that we secure the western coast of the Salahad."

 U07_compensatory_damages_title:0 "Compensatory Damages"
 U07_compensatory_damages_desc:0 "If that mutinous traitor Mykx thinks that just because she is in Aelantir she can abscond with one of our ships and leech off our market, then she has another thing coming. Its high time we launched an expedition to demand some “compensatory damages” from these rebels – their lives and her eponymous town’s freedom will be just the start. Its time for us to get our due recompense."

 U07_the_eastern_presence_title:0 "The Western Presence"
 U07_the_eastern_presence_desc:0 "Since our expedition to recapture the mutineers who had fled to Aelantir, we have been left with a fairly significant presence in the region – and we have found that it is easy to see why Mykx fled here in the first place. With fleets of trading ships sailing from Aelantir to Cannor every month, ripe for the taking and carrying the riches of the sundered continent in their holds, expanding our western presence is sure to greatly enrich us."

 U07_plantations_in_east_sarhal_title:0 "Plantations in East Sarhal"
 U07_plantations_in_east_sarhal_desc:0 "There is a reason Sarhal is such a rich and bountiful continent – much of the continent is perfect for growing the luxury goods that are in such high demand in Cannor or Haless, and our recently captured holdings in East Sarhal are no exception. If we are to solidify our position as the pre-eminent thalassocracy in the world, then we must rededicate ourselves to ruthlessly exploiting our captured lands – even if the local population pays a heavy price."

 U07_overlord_of_the_west_title:0 "Overlord of the West"
 U07_overlord_of_the_west_desc:0 "Ekha has been our tributary for a while now, sending caravans of gold, slaves and luxury goods on a regular basis. However, it is of no doubt that our relationship is a fractious one, with Ekhan merchants and diplomats actively courting the other nations of the Divenhal for relief from Viakkoca domination. If we are to shore up our hold on Akasik, we must tighten our grip on Ekha, and ensure that we are at last the undisputed overlord of the western city."

 U07_more_than_middlemen_title:0 "More than Middlemen"
 U07_more_than_middlemen_desc:0 "For too long, Viakkoc’s focus has been purely on raiding, mostly for goods and gold, either selling on what slaves we do capture or sacrificing them to our demonic patrons. This has partly been because of our tenuous grip on our Akasi territories – but with Deshak annexed and Ekha subdued, it is time that we rectify this situation. By reorganising our holdings, and enslaving large parts of the human population, we can finally be more than middlemen, and set ourselves to ruling our lands properly, as any true gnollish kingdom would. We must be prepared for anything, however – the Akasi may not be too pleased at this development."

 U07_two_cities_title:0 "The Two Cities"
 U07_two_cities_desc:0 "The seas of West Sarhal are rich indeed, with the Vyzemby, Fangaulans and Horasheshi engaging in regular and extensive seaborne trade, which has only become more profitable with the recent expansion in Cannorian contact. The centres of this trade, Kunolo and Lelenan, are therefore prime targets for new corsair harbours, from which we can both dominate overland trade and expand our privateering operations."

 U07_paxet_ardimax_title:0 "Paxet Ardimax"
 U07_paxet_ardimax_desc:0 "The sea route around Ardimya is a long and difficult one, but it is necessary if we are to fully exploit the boundless riches of the Ringlet Sea and the Coffee Coast. In order to alleviate our supply problems in this region, it is vital that we secure a proper corsair harbour, and the island of Elsine – as the Cannorians call it – seems the best location for the new Paxet Ardimax."

 U07_of_coffee_and_slaves_title:0 "Of Coffee and Slaves"
 U07_of_coffee_and_slaves_desc:0 "With the route to Haless finally opened to us, the unimaginable riches of East Sarhal and South Haless have opened alongside them. The Coffee Coast of East Sarhal in particular is ripe for raiding – by capturing the most important ports in the region, we can dominate trade there, and pillage any non-Viakkoca ships in our sight."

 U07_a_slavers_paradise_title:0 "A Slaver's Paradise"
 U07_a_slavers_paradise_desc:0 "Upon first glance, one might think that the Republic of Bhuvauri – a nation born from a mass slave revolt – would be the natural enemy of Viakkoc, the feared dread-slavers of the Southern Seas. However, to the astonishment of many Viakkoca captains, the opposite seems to be true.\n\nBhuvauri has proved our best and most willing customer, slaves from our ships flow into Sramaya every month. What they do to those slaves, whether they free them, set them to work or turn them into those slave-soldiers of theirs, is of no concern to us – if we are to actually turn a profit from all these slaves we’ve been capturing, then we must exploit this slaver’s paradise we’ve happened upon."

 U07_true_pirates_of_the_ringlet_sea_title:0 "True Pirates of the Ringlet Sea"
 U07_true_pirates_of_the_ringlet_sea_desc:0 "In the Ringlet Sea, the Yan pirates of Pinghoi were widely feared, with their massive raids, hundreds of red-sailed junks descending on cities and ports from Sarhal to Keoden. There is some respect there, between corsairs – they were daring, dangerous, and their old pack-mistress, Ping Shuang, was a good leader, unwavering and determined. But if Haless thinks that Pinghoi is as bad as it gets, then they’re about to be rudely awakened."

 U07_into_the_jungle_title:0 "Into the Jungle"
 U07_into_the_jungle_desc:0 "A smart gnoll with a few comparable ship ledgers can be a terrible thing. Recently, one of our most influential captains in the far-east has come to the realisation that the profits from raiding ship traffic coming from Arawkelin and Cay Cam Sinh is far outweighed by the potential profit from capturing the cities directly, and using them as a base to both launch land-based slave raids into the jungles of the Lupulan and further sea raids into Rahen and Yanshen. It seems that the lives of the millions of people living in South Haless are about to get a whole lot worse – and that we’re about to make a whole lot more money."

 U07_finishing_the_fight_title:0 "Finishing the Fight"
 U07_finishing_the_fight_desc:0 "When we crossed the Akasik mountains, our forces crushed the Kingdom of Khasa, casting their armies aside and feasting on the corpses of their people. However, we were temporarily prevented from attacking the weakened Deshak by the intervention of Eborthil – cautious of another disaster like at Kheterata, Viakkoc XI halted, deciding to properly assess the dangers ahead before marching on the last human kingdom in Akasik. At last, our foes have been weighed, and found wanting. It is time to seize on this opportunity and finally claim the glory Viakkoc deserves!"

 U07_new_force_in_the_divenhal_title:0 "New Force in the Divenhal"
 U07_new_force_in_the_divenhal_desc:0 "It has been far too long since the peoples of the Divenhal truly felt the power of Gnollkind, on land or sea. But now, with our corsairs seizing ships across the sea, and our raiders pillaging port towns from Sorncóst to the coast of Bahar, everyone within sight of the sea has learnt to fear the sight of the black flags of Viakkoc. But still, there are challengers to our quickly emerging thalassocracy, and if we are to cement ourselves as the new force in the Divenhal, we must overcome the pirates of Nathalaire."

 U07_thieves_of_the_sea_title:0 "Thieves of the Sea"
 U07_thieves_of_the_sea_desc:0 "The art of capturing a vessel intact is a fine one indeed, and it's one that Viakkoc has been slowly perfecting. Capturing ships is far preferable to sinking them – they can be scrapped in our ports, instead of sinking to the bottom of the ocean, and combat-worthy vessels can even be turned on their former masters – and that isn’t even mentioning the rush of happening upon a finer prize, taking the pride of a seafaring nation and decorating the deck with their half-eaten corpses!\n\nOne day, Viakkoc will become the premier thieves of the sea, and our fleets will be full of the scavenged and refitted ships of our enemies – even if we need a little bit of practice to get there."

 U07_fruits_of_empire_title:0 "Fruits of Empire"
 U07_fruits_of_empire_desc:0 "The Empire of Anbennar and its western neighbour Lorent are some of the richest regions on Halann. Their cities are grand and their people are prosperous – well, the people who we haven’t gotten to yet, of course. Obviously, we must dedicate ourselves to raiding and exploiting these lands as much as possible, within our borders and beyond. For this purpose, the city of Gabelaire will be rebuilt from the ground up as the greatest Raider Hub in Cannor, the centre of our land-based operations – and the first target of the marauders within will be the recently ruined ruins of Old Damenath, and the wealth of knowledge and ideas within."

 U07_the_grand_line_title:0 "The Grand Line"
 U07_the_grand_line_desc:0 "The sea-route from Anbenncost to Arawkelin is a long one indeed. It takes months to traverse the southern seas, around Cape Abada and the reaches of Ardimya. But that route – what our corsairs, pirates and slave-traders have taken to calling “The Grand Line” – is the artery of our realm, our very own Golden Highway, through which the riches of Viakkoc flow. If we are to cement the power and wealth of our empire, then we need to tighten our grip on the Grand Line, so that the riches of Viakkoc’s holdings all flow back to our capital."

 U07_the_great_corsair_empire_title:0 "The Great Corsair Empire"
 U07_the_great_corsair_empire_desc:0 "When our army was scattered beneath the walls of Kheterata, and our empire disintegrated around us as the pack marched north, many believed that the days of Viakkoc were numbered. How wrong they were. Now, we stand as the undisputed master of the Divenhal and the Southern Seas and the richest and most powerful empire on Halann. Our Hellfire Pirates and dread-corsairs are feared from the Ruin to the Ringlet sea, while captives from every continent in the world slave away in our plantations and Hellpits. Now, the only thing missing is a title befitting our status."

 U07_scourge_of_the_east_title:0 "Scourge of the East"
 U07_scourge_of_the_east_desc:0 "Eborthil has long dominated the passage of ships between the two halves of the Divenhal, and have long leveraged that advantage to influence affairs across the middle sea – most recently in direct opposition to us, when Delian II assumed the throne of Deshak. Beyond the Isle of Tef lies the fractured but wealthy, lands of Bulwar and Bahar – perfect places to advance our place in the slave trade. If we are to capitalise on this opportunity, then we must destroy Eborthil, and open the eastern Divenhal to our corsairs."

 U07_under_new_managment_title:0 "Under New Management"
 U07_under_new_managment_desc:0 "If we are to truly capitalise on our conquest of Eborthil and Deshak, we must do everything in our power to cement our rule in their former lands. The capitals of the two realms, as well as the strategically important merchant city of Mushesh, shall be converted into slave-entrepots – with their current inhabitants among our first victims – and we shall settle members of our pack across the Isle of Tef. Let us remind our new subjects that they’re under new, Gnollish management."

 U07_improvise_adapt_title:0 "Improvise, adapt..."
 U07_improvise_adapt_desc:0 "From our tough beginnings in the Salahad, to the devastating defeat beneath the walls of Kheterata, Viakkoc has never been a stranger to defeat or struggle or calamity. But our strength – the reason we have not met the fate of so many other gnollish kingdoms in history – is that we have the power to reorganise and adapt to meet those challenges.\n\nAnd so, as we face the advanced, powerful navies of the Cannorian powers, we must do all we can to improve our own forces. The creation of harbours dedicated to collecting Cannorian vessels, equipment, armour and weapons will allow us to imitate their successes, and even improve on them, and should we reward these “collectors” generously, they are sure to become hotspots for the fiercest raiders in our lands."

 U07_hellfire_pirates_title:0 "Hellfire Pirates"
 U07_hellfire_pirates_desc:0 "We have always employed the aid of our demonic patrons to empower ourselves, but with our stocks of captured Cannorian steel armour expanding, and our sea-borne corsair raiders getting ever-more experienced and dangerous, it is clear that we may be able to focus our efforts. By investing our sacrificial resources in our marines, and outfitting them in the best of our captured plate, we can create a small but determined force of demonically empowered shock troopers. One day, the entire world will fear Viakkoc’s “Hellfire Pirates”."

 U07_the_great_raid_title:0 "The Great Raid"
 U07_the_great_raid_desc:0 "When we arrived in Akasik, and heard tales of a great port city to the north – the biggest city in the world, by some accounts – dreams of Viakkoca pirates storming its harbours and plundering its riches filled the hearts of our raiders. When we discovered the true size, wealth, and power of this city – Anbenncost – the capital of the Empire of Anbennar, those dreams turned to state policy. No matter what, that city will be ours, even if it means we must launch the greatest raid in Gnollish history to take it!"

 U07_dove_throne_despoiled_desc:0 "Anbenncost is ours. The Great Raid was a stunning success, the Emperor’s armies lie scattered and defeated, and our soldiers have already begun seizing its wealth and sacrificing its inhabitants in celebration, as demonflame pyres send acrid smoke high above the city. But our Corsair King has one last thing to do before our conquest can truly be considered complete, for there is a throne in the middle of Anbenncost, and nobody to sit on it."

 U07_hellpits_of_dameria_title:0 "Hellpits of Dameria"
 U07_hellpits_of_dameria_desc:0 "The Damerian Dales have long been centres of iron production, vast stores of metal ore hidden beneath the picturesque rolling hills of the countryside. Similarly, the Moonmount also has supplies of iron and coal, though the difficulty in reaching them has led to the operations there being significantly smaller.\n\nIf Viakkoc is to exploit its new Cannorian territory, it is time that we set ourselves – and our slaves – to the task of expanding these sources. In these “Hellpits” countless slaves will tear apart the earth in order to extract every ounce of iron from these hills, no matter the cost or the conditions."

 U07_queen_of_the_hill_desc:0 "The hill gnoll tribes of the Khenak mountains have long been a thorn in the side of the human kingdoms of Businor, but it seems that their days of power are at an end. As the humans increase in strength, and Xanzerbexis falls ever further behind, it seems nothing less than a miracle is needed to save them – and it seems our emergence from the Salahad, and subsequent conquest of Akasik, might be just that miracle.

Though discipline is not a word one would associate with gnolls, the comradery and determination of the humans we faced in Businor has certainly convinced us of its usefulness. By rigorously training our soldiers – and scouring the seas and shores of Cannor for more equipment and tougher foes to fight – we shall ensure our corsairs are known far and wide as the sea demons of the Divenhal."

While this would also naturally prevent us from raiding lands Nathalaire controls and we may be forced to compete with Nathalaire for raiding rights in the waters near the city, it may give us a significant boost to our finances."

When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] upended the table, they scattered. Meat and bone and gold and silver clattered to the floor. The source of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] anger was obvious to all – the human population of Akasik had risen up in revolt, led by some rabble-rouser called “Jackal-Hearted Kayir”. Already much of the eastern mountains had been lost, and thousands of gnolls had been killed.\n\n“Fools!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] snarled through beared teeth, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] drew [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] femur-handled cutlass and brandished it against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subordinates. “Fools and traitors!” The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] leapt over the upturned table and grabbed the governor of east Deshak by the scruff of her neck. The gnoll whimpered as she felt her lord’s blade against her belly, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] maw an inch from hers. “Why are you here, Suvnaazh!? Why!? Half the Akasik burns, Kayir does not, and yet you are HERE!”\nThe governor let out a nervous laugh as she sputtered. “T-The rebels– they crushed m-my forces!” Saliva dribbled out from between Suvnaazh’s dagger-like teeth as she rushed to stammer an explanation.. “K-Killed half my pack! They’re in the east b-but– I can go back! F-Fix this–!”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] surged forwards – in the same instant as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] blade sliced open her belly, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s teeth plunged deep into her throat. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] ripped [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] maw away, tearing flesh and tasting blood, and threw Suvnaazh’s corpse at the other assembled pack-lords, her hanging entrails wrapping around her as she flew. The governor’s body hit the ground hard at their feet. Some suppressed laughs, born half out of fear and half out of satisfaction, from a rival defeated or punishment delivered.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] pointed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] blade at the other gnolls in the tent. “Kryzzaar!

It was midday, but smoke from the fire and demonflame that now consumed the city smothered the sun, darkness pierced only by an ominous hue of orange and green. The great Remnant Fleet ships in the Silverdocks burned. The wretches of the Bilge had all been thrown onto sacrificial pyres or into slave pens, the Temple District rededicated to infernal masters. And now the once proud imperial palace was being defiled by the city’s new masters.\n\nWhen the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was finished with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] meal, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wiped the blood from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] maw and stepped deeper into the throne room.

They took Cailan along with them, and despite his newfound dedication to “care no longer”, he found his stomach dropping when his new gnollish overlord, standing before the Dove Throne itself, directed the acting Lord Mayor to stand before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].

He picked up the crown at his feet, and, as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] kneeled on one knee, placed it atop [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head.

Lungs clogged with smoke and dust, sweat mixing with blood on his skin. He couldn’t falter, couldn’t pause for rest – not unless he wanted more scars on his back. Taken from his home across the sea, shipped halfway across the world – little more than a dead man walking.\nThe whip cracked again – a woman’s cry, this time, as a pickaxe clanged to the stone floor of the open air mine. Tesfaye couldn’t resist turning his head to check – a reflex held over from better times. A Cannorian woman was backing up against the wall as a laughing gnoll advanced against her, jagged sword already raised. The woman grabbed at her dropped pick, holding it close to her chest, shaking. The Mengi slave turned back to the stone in front of him, shaking his head. Rise and strike. Don’t pay attention to the screams. Rise and Strike. Rise and–\nA shriek accompanied a wet piercing sound, as a body thudded against the rock. Tesfaye’s head snapped back again, involuntarily – but he did not see the woman’s corpse. A gnoll laid dead on the ground, a pickaxe lodged in the base of his skull. The woman had a blank expression on her bloodied face. All the other slaves were looking, now, as did another gnoll, who wasted no time as she rushed towards her companion’s killer. The Mengi slave’s stomach dropped. They’d kill all of them for this, no doubt. He would walk no longer.\nAnother slave – a bearded elf from the western continent – lunged at the gnoll, intercepted her. Tesfaye found himself running to the elf’s aid. He rose his pickaxe, and cried out as he plunged the head into gnoll’s chest like he was striking rock. Bone cracked and gave way. He looked at the other slaves, and at the overseers beyond them looking back as he withdrew his pick, raising it to the air high, defiant.\n“Rise and strike!”, Tesfaye cried. The gnolls laughed, cackled – but when the gnolls began to tumble from the stepped walls of the pit, Seascourge skulls and chains alike broken by the crack of the pick, they laughed no longer. Today, the Hellpits rose, and today its slaves would strike back."

 flavor_viakkoc.10.d:0 "With Anbenncóst, the city of the world’s desire, now under our complete control, its place within our empire is now clear – it shall be our capital, the seat of our ruler’s demonic throne. However, there are still questions about the nature of the city itself. Our leadership has generally divided into two camps on the issue. One side argues that we should use the exceptional location of the city, as well as its magnificent palaces, buildings and managerial offices, to turn gnollish Anbenncóst into the beating administrative heart of our Corsair Empire. This would allow us to expand our government’s reach and coercive power.\n\nThe other side argues that the city’s prime location – alongside the massive port that had previously seen goods from all over the world arrive in its docks – mean that Anbenncóst should instead serve that as core of our slaving operations, a massive slave entrepot from which we can ship and then redistribute slaves to both our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s plantations and foreign and domestic buyers. While this may make the city vulnerable to local unrest, it will undoubtedly have a great effect on our trading and raiding profits.\n\nUltimately, the choice is [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s to make."

 flavor_viakkoc.11.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] let out a restrained cackle under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] breath as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked upon the new map that had been placed on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bedchamber wall. The imperial apartments in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Anbenncóst palace was richly decorated with the riches of Halann – ivory from Dreksaret, porcelain from the Kharunyana, Dakinshi gold and Effelai wood – but it was this map that was the star of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] abode. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] grazed a hand over it as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] grinned, eyes narrowing as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] studied the names and boundaries inked onto the fine parchment. The map documented every far flung colony and corsair harbour under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] iron grip – every outpost of the greatest maritime empire in history.\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] contemplated the power hidden behind the borders of the map, in the sea lanes that bound [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] realm together. Dread fleets of hundreds of ships, descending on the helpless coastal realms of the world. All along the Grand Line, thousands of tons of cargo, living or not, travelled from Cannor to Haless and vice versa, stolen or produced by the millions of slaves under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] control. The jewel of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] possessions, however, was much closer to home. [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned away from the map, moving towards the balcony outside [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] apartments. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] placed a hand on the railing as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] overlooked [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] city – Anbenncóst transformed. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could see the burning pyres of sacrifice, the fighting pits, armouries and barracks, and the endless storehouses and slave pens that proved a fine display of Viakkoc’s economic might. Cannor’s heart consumed by the Seascourge’s ambition!\nViakkoc once ruled the sands of the western Salahad and the savannas of the Kubaci, nearly put the Empire of Kheterata to the sword – but Grizaka and Gnollakaz shattered that realm. The old realm. As they crossed the Salahad, abandoning their lands in Fangaula, the Seascourge Gnolls abandoned one dream and replaced it with another – and now look at them. Look at the fruits of pride! Perhaps [Root.Monarch.GetName] had been indulging in Cannorian arts too much lately, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] simply could not help [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] – the reversal, the theatre of it all! To claw and bite and slaughter back from the brink, to dominion! The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] let out a rumbling roar of a laugh, a hearty but sinister cackle that only a gnollish packlord could produce. The Great Corsair Empire, ruling over an empire over which the sun never set."
