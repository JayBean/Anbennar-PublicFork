 H61_meeting_the_natives_title: "Meeting the Natives"
 H61_meeting_the_natives_desc: "While we have called these new lands our home, it has always been apparent that we are not the only inhabitants: various Ruinborn tribes, who have been living here since times unknown, have also laid claim to this land. Contacting and communicating with these tribes can allow for an establishment for trade and would make our expansion easier."

 H61_allowing_the_tribes_their_autonomy_title: "Tribal Autonomy"
 H61_allowing_the_tribes_their_autonomy_desc: "The tribes of the Epednar have been living alongside us for some time, to the point that any journey from one homestead to another presents a chance of encountering them. However, they have not been particularly interested in living under our full rule, and their worldviews are different from ours in many unique ways. Rather than trying to force them to our view, however, we shall respect their views and give them some autonomy so they can maintain their own tribes peacefully."

 H61_making_friends_out_of_strangers_title: "Strangers to Friends"
 H61_making_friends_out_of_strangers_desc: "Unlike the others, that is how the Epednar would describe us. And they would say it with a strong hint of surprise as well, for the Epednar have for eons endured nothing but exclusion, violence and displacement at the hands of the Ynnic and more recently the Cannorian settlers. But not us; no, we have not just accepted the Epednar, we fully embraced them into our society. And while they were wary at first, the Epednar slowly realized that we truly did not mean any harm to them. This was solidified when we were saved from the stalactite-jaws of the mountain-sized Posakawa by that brave raggedy knight. From that day onward did we not only see the Epednar as fellow inhabitants of the Expanse, but as our kin under the same banner as well, as fellow countrymen, as fellow Plumsteaders."

 H61_equipping_the_raggedy_knights_title: "Equipping the Knights"
 H61_equipping_the_raggedy_knights_desc: "Ever since that fateful day, the numbers of those that emulate the first Raggedy Knight have sky-rocketed, leading to a band of highly esteemed knights in their makeshift armor. Supporting these daring warriors by equipping them with arms and armor shall be an immense boon to the protection of our nation."

 H61_riding_north_title: "Riding North"
 H61_riding_north_desc: "We have taken the dam in Adbabovhi and the Raggedy Knights have been made ready for war. It is now time to expand our control northward over the Epednar Expanse. We must take control over Paihubi and the Epadynn river running through it. Not only will it give us control over lands rich in metals and pastures, we will also gain access to the supposed remains of Domfanynn, the city of the fabled Paihubi valley civilization or Epadynnics."

 H61_a_very_wild_west_title: "A Very Wild West"
 H61_a_very_wild_west_desc: "Imagine a land where even if you ride north for weeks, you may not encounter a single soul.\nImagine a land where the grass forms an unending sea, upon which steeds can roam endlessly.\nImagine a land where most places have never been visited by ruinborn or human, a wild expanse on the western side of the Ynn. We must and shall stake our claim on this area, so our Epednar brethren can roam and thrive freely here, without the intervention or the persecution of other states or races. This vast expanse shall be a haven of freedom for the mounted ruinborn and will create a buffer between our heartlands and any lord who holds ill intentions towards us. The west is wild, but tamed she shall be!"

 H61_how_the_west_was_won_title: "How the West was Won"
 H61_how_the_west_was_won_desc: ""Day 157: It has been completed. After 157 days, starting on the 1st of Suren [GetYear] I rode northward, and while I expected to remain rather lonely, I could not have suspected this. For weeks I met not a single soul, not even an Epednar who was exiled from their tribe or a prospector looking for riches. Now, after 157 days I have completed my trek from Hubi Boru to Fort Puhau, and we truly know how far the realm reaches. I now truly understand what expansive means and why these lands are called wild and how far the realm reaches.’\n\nAria of Songsbridge, who had undertaken this journey as part of her studies, had done what none had done before. She had crossed the entire expanse from the southern desert up to Port Puhau in the north. She counted the days and even kept track of the distances she crossed each day to get a grasp on the true size of the Epednar Expanse. Her numbers ‘tamed’ the once wild and unquantifiable west. The west was won, and it was Plumstead who got to enjoy the spoils."

 H61_end_tribal_feuds_title: "End Tribal Feuds"
 H61_end_tribal_feuds_desc: "We tolerated the tribal disputes and feuds of the numerous Epednar tribes for a long time, but what happened at Buffalo Skull Ranch is just unacceptable. We are now forced to step in and reign in the feuding tribes and individuals. We will pay for any previous damages and settle land disputes, yet we will also enforce the rule of law and punish any tribesman who dares to harm another for things that are deemed "tribal feuding", which can range from stealing because they are from another tribe or killing because they insulted their kin. We expect that suppressing the hotheads will lead to more amicable relations between the tribes and end the constant feuding and fighting."

 H61_build_it_and_they_will_gather_title: "The Gathering Grounds"
 H61_build_it_and_they_will_gather_desc: "Decentralized as they may be, the Epednar still need a central location from which they can communicate, negotiate and cooperate with the Plumsteader government. In order to achieve this, a city must be built; a city of the Epednar."

 H61_one_people_title: "One People"
 H61_one_people_desc: "We came from far, very far. We once started as the Plumwaller Expedition Society and have now grown to be the strongest, wisest and most prosperous realm in the Epednar Expanse and the Ynn. We are a union of ruinborn and human, of pastures and orchards, of pastoralists and homesteaders. We are Plumsteaders."

 H61_planting_seeds_title: "Planting Seeds"
 H61_planting_seeds_desc: "As our nation takes the first steps towards becoming established, it is clear that we must found a proper capital of our own in order to plant the seed of our ambitions. The lands that we have called Yanudahna and Ciodsibh shall serve as the starting point of our nation, one that will inevitably bloom from the point of its seeding."

 H61_taking_root_title: "Taking Root"
 H61_taking_root_desc: "Now that we have planted the seeds of our nation, it is time for them to start taking root through force of arms. Creating the tools for our continued protection and the ability to accomplish our goals shall help our Plumcloaks and further our ambitions."

 H61_reaching_the_river_title: "Reaching the River"
 H61_reaching_the_river_desc: "Our ambitions have brought us to the river that gives a large portion of the continent its name: the Ynn. This river, worshiped by those living on its banks, is wide and deep, with only a few crossing points. Before we can expand our reach in the region, we must first set up a staging ground. By taking the west bank of the lower Ynn, building fortifications and making contact with the locals, we can ensure a firm foundation for our thrust into the region."

 H61_this_damn_dam_title: "This Damn Dam"
 H61_this_damn_dam_desc: "Dams have always been an impressive showcase of building, and the Dam in Adbabovhi far more so. The people that maintain and live around this dam are of a foreign religion, one known as the Ynn River Worship. If we are to take this dam, we would also have to make assurances to these people that their religion would not be infringed upon."

 H61_the_request_of_a_standard_title: "The Request of a Standard"
 H61_the_request_of_a_standard_desc: "We have taken over Vels Domfan, and fear is taking hold of the local artisans. They had for eons been the premier producer of glass currency in the lower Ynn and had therefore enjoyed a level of security and patronage unlike any other craft. But with the Ynn-based rule gone, the artisans fear that their craft will be rendered obsolete as well, as we do not use glass as a currency.\n\nOn the other hand, our own population would be opposed to changing our currency, and not without reason. Our system of a bimetalic silver standard has for decades created economic stability and kept the livelihoods of homesteaders, cattle barons and plumfarmers secure./n/nSo we will have to come up with a way to keep both groups in business. We can achieve this by creating a special glass coin for our Ynnic territories which can be used outside the area as well. This glass coin, named the Plumcrystal will have the shape of a small coin with rims of silver. The amount of rims will denote its value and the silver content itself will ensure its value outside of the Ynn and therefore keeping the silver standard intact. This synthesis will both keep the glass artisans in business and show our commitment to ruling with the Ynn, and not over them."

 H61_dark_side_of_the_river_title: "Dark Side of the River"
 H61_dark_side_of_the_river_desc: "The western bank of the Ynn river is by many called the ‘dark side’ of the river. Not because it is a land gloomy or filled with monsters, but because there are not many large cities or settlements. As such, taking it should be a relatively easy task, as the lords of the Ynn will not fight as hard for these regions as they would on the eastern bank. Let’s take the western bank and enlighten its people!"

 H61_crossing_the_river_title: "Crossing the River"
 H61_crossing_the_river_desc: "All of our eastward expansion has led to this moment; we control the river, two of its dams and the lands that lie between. The lower Ynn is now under the banner of Plumstead. From the crossing at Adbrabovhi up to Vels Bacar, we rule and roam. Our new subjects integrated into our realm, their traditions and religion respected and accepted, we stand as the true and benevolent masters of Sarda."

 H61_convincing_the_unconvinced_title: "Convincing the Unconvinced"
 H61_convincing_the_unconvinced_desc: "When we arrived in Aelantir, we did not care for the religious traditions of the local populations. Instead we granted them autonomy and even protected their rights to religious freedom. But now the times have changed and so have our religious principles. We will need everybody in our realm to be working hard if we are to achieve our goal of unraveling the many secrets Sarda holds. We should grant the rector-missionaries permits to set up missions alongside the trade routes in Sarda and spread the faith as efficiently and thoroughly as possible. Every nook and cranny of Sarda must be enlightened by the truth of the one true God. We must employ the best orators and debaters to convince the local population of our convictions. All this shall be done so we may call upon these new converts in our quest for knowledge. God wills it!"

 H61_theological_and_intellectual_victory_title: "The Winning Argument"
 H61_theological_and_intellectual_victory_desc: "The debate has ended, and the true faith has won. Ravelianism has won, not through needless violence or incoherent, albeit entertaining  preaching. No, our faith has won because it has the best arguments. It is a faith which is proven true by the continued unraveling of the world around it and which is strengthened by each scientific discovery made, one which praises the one true God. We have won because we treat the theological and intellectual as intertwined. It is written that our faith strengthens science, and science strengthens our faith!\n\nThough our realm may be convinced, we have a long road ahead of us. It is our sacred duty to spread the word of the Ravelian Church to all corners of the Ynn, for God wills it!"

 H61_a_league_of_universities_title: "A League of Universities"
 H61_a_league_of_universities_desc: "The University of the Dame has grown to be one of the most prestigious universities of the world and the most prestigious in the Ynn. It is now time to turn our auxiliary campuses and other affiliated universities into fully independent universities with their own fields of expertise and their own culture. Only by embracing the differences between the different universities can we achieve greatness and unravel the world. Only by creating a League of Universities can we ensure that the greatest minds get everything they need to achieve greatness and make discoveries and inventions beyond our wildest dreams!"

 H61_our_own_plumcloaks_title: "Our Own Plumcloaks"
 H61_our_own_plumcloaks_desc: "The Expanse is a large stretch of land that extends to leagues upon leagues, and with that space comes the trouble of keeping our orchards under order. We have however found a solution to this question by looking back at our heritage and the lands we once used to call home. In Plumwall there were the plumcoaks, a form of mobile constables, tasked with keeping order and aiding the local population. By establishing our own order of "Plumcloak" rangers that can live off the land far more easily and efficiently fight in the plains, we can start efforts to build up and expand our reach and orchards."

 H61_setting_up_homesteads_title: "Setting up Homesteads"
 H61_setting_up_homesteads_desc: "Our people have spread out wide across the plains in order to plant orchards of plums, yet are in need of support; not only in maintaining these orchards, but themselves. Giving them the resources and work needed to help them set up self-sufficient homesteads shall enable them to continue this growth."

 H61_planting_more_orchards_title: "Planting more Orchards"
 H61_planting_more_orchards_desc: "‘Tart, though tasty, fruity, forbearing freshness.’ This is how the Plumsteader variety of the plum is described by those who feast upon the purple fruits of our labor. We have successfully planted orchards which dot the landscape along the Isobel and the harvest proves to be bountiful and lasting. So many plums are grown that our farmers are unsure what to do with the excess produce. Should we set up large scale brandy distilleries? Give it to the hungry and needy? Export it in bulk to make a quick buck of it? Or will we feed our livestock with the purple treat? They have asked the state to set decrees on what to do with excess harvest and revise these every few years, according to what is deemed the best path."

 H61_adjusting_to_the_soil_title: "Adjusting to the Soil"
 H61_adjusting_to_the_soil_desc: "Our plums have taken root, and so have we. And just as our nation boasts a variety of peoples, so do our orchards boast a variety of plums. We have been able to compile a list of the five most common variants:\n\nThe Mayor. A sweet plum which when dried retains its flavor. Created by homesteaders after the mayor of Plumstead City requested for a plum that could be exported abroad.\n\nThe Plumsteader Plucot. A crisp and sweet hybrid of plum and apricot. According to locals, the apricots come from a mage who was really craving them and conjured them.\n\nThe Epednar Heart. Sweet yet tart and shaped like a heart. They symbolize our friendship with the ruinborn.\n\nThe Isobel. Named after the river, this variety is sweet and has a bright reddish yellow color. Invented by UotD students in the university gardens and as such exclusive and rare.\n\nThe Dameson or Damesplum. A sour and tart variety with a deep purple hue. Great taste when cooked and is only eaten raw by people with digestion problems. A hardy fruit, just like the Sons of the Dame!\n\nThese varieties have thrived in these lands and have gifted us with delicious treats and deep coffers. Our achievements are one which we should foster and the bountiful harvest after years of hard work have even born a new proverb which celebrates success after hard work: ‘When the plum is purple, the Plumsteader is proud.’"

 H61_horsing_around_title: "Horsing Around"
 H61_horsing_around_desc: "Besides orchards, crop fields and cattle, we also possess an unfathomable number of horses. And while most horses descend primarily from sturdy Damerian workbreeds, some are cross bred with many varieties brought over by immigrants. We are however still lacking a horsebreed which can quickly transport us across our vast realm. Luckily, the mages of the UotD have come up with a solution; to create our very own breed of horse. This new breed, the ‘Plumhair Mustang’, will be a horse born and bred for our cavalry, scouts and messengers and be ‘a little different’. This new Plumhair Mustang will from birth be fed magically-infused damesplums to make it faster, sturdier and stronger. The UotD requests lands and resources to build a large stable complex so that these new foals can grow and thrive under the supervision of the university, and to prevent any accidents. Not that they think such accidents  happen, of course - but just to be sure."

 H61_cliffside_mining_forging_and_craftworks_title: "Mining Regulation"
 H61_cliffside_mining_forging_and_craftworks_desc: "‘Metals, minerals and miners, this is what we are discussing today.’ The representatives look at the large amount of paperwork and can not believe their eyes; Prospectors working at the ruincliffs have long claimed that massive deposits of metals were to be found at the eastern edges. Now the UotD has confirmed it, and advises us to step in and regulate the mining immediately to ensure not only profitability for the state and efficiency in the operations, but in particular to make sure that safety is taken in account, as one wrong blast could have a whole chunk of cliffside crash down upon settlers in the bay. They advise us to grant a select number of mining companies the right to mining the cliffs in exchange for a large, yet reasonable tariff. They also suggest that we give the glassmakers of Vels Domfan the right of ‘first choice’, so they may select the best minerals or metals to use in the creation of glass currency. Lastly they say we should subsidize the building of the mining facilities to create goodwill with the mining companies and also make them semi-dependent on the state in order to enforce the tariffs."

 H61_thorny_tradeways_title: "Thorny Tradeways"
 H61_thorny_tradeways_desc: "Descending the Isobel river will have you end up at the rim, which when followed down will lead you to Fort Thorn. Here our realm ends and that of the City of Isobelin begins. Keeping good relations with the thorns on the bottom is of the utmost importance, as the whole elevator acts like a ‘mechanical condominium’ over which both our nations hold responsibility. And while Isobelin may or may not always have control over the region, it is still important to keep good contacts with whoever holds the fort, as it is our gateway to the sea and to the international trade routes."

 H61_our_influence_in_the_bay_title: "Our Influence in the Bay"
 H61_our_influence_in_the_bay_desc: "Our route via Fort Thorn has developed into an artery of trade and commerce, and has slowly become a vital part of our economy. We should, to ensure the continuation of the flow of commerce, take indirect control over the bay. Whether we do this via diplomacy or force is a matter of strategy, for the outcome will in both cases be rather simple; Plumsteader control over the trade routes from the Ynn to the bay and back. We will, in return, help our new subject in gaining control over the rest of the bay, so we may both prosper under the Plumsteader banner."

 H61_a_sarda_veridical_title: "A Sarda Veridical"
 H61_a_sarda_veridical_desc: "Not only must we convert Sarda to the one true faith, we must also keep them devout to it. To do this, we will need to make the Sarda know and feel that they are an integral part of the community and that they have a say as well. And we can achieve this by appointing a Sarda-based and Sarda-born Veridical with St. Elvyr as the center of their diocese. Making St. Elvyr the center of the Ravelian Church in Sarda has two benefits: the first is that Adbrabovhi used to be the center of Ynnic Rivership and is therefore already filled with faculties that we can reuse for our own religious administration. The second is that St. Elvyr and its information on the old religious traditions give the faith a new, non-Cannorian perspective, making it easier for us to adapt the local traditions to our doctrine and mediate between the ruinborn and the Church."

 H61_embodying_damish_values_title: "Embodying Damish Values"
 H61_embodying_damish_values_desc: "While we have left our original homelands in seeking a new one in the expanse, we shall still hold onto the core values of Plumwall as true Damerians, just as the Dame preached . These values of tolerance and innovation shall be our focal point in the future of our nation, ones we will embody full-heartedly."

 H61_rally_sons_of_the_dame_title: "Rally, Sons of the Dame"
 H61_rally_sons_of_the_dame_desc: "Merely embodying the values of the Dame personally is not enough, for how could we meaningfully embody something that lives not just in our people, but the institutions of knowledge and learning  which they built. Establishing the very institutions that our once home had is of the utmost importance. Let us set up a university where the unraveling of knowledge and finding the truth is of the utmost importance. Where we can experiment freely to improve our agriculture, industry and living conditions. A place where no matter who you are, you can contribute to the eternal quest of finding that which is unknown. Let us establish a University of the Dame!"

 H61_formalizing_a_curriculum_title: "Formalizing a Curriculum"
 H61_formalizing_a_curriculum_desc: "Now that we have set up a campus and taken care of the physical necessities for a university, is it time to formalize a curriculum and define what our university specializes in. While we will of course offer classes in political sciences, physiocratics, rudimentary magic and theology, we do have a primary focus; agricultural and industrial advancement. Classes like ‘Basics of Botany’, ‘the Plums and the Bees’ and ‘Agro-Artificery 101’ will be taught to improve our own crop yields and keep the soil healthy. And so by becoming the academic center of agricultural science we will help not only our own farmers, homesteaders and ranchers, but those of our allies and trade partners as well. Through feeding the mind, shall we feed the belly."

 H61_creating_auxiliary_facilities_title: "Auxiliary Campuses"
 H61_creating_auxiliary_facilities_desc: "We have chosen a focus on agricultural sciences and are therefore needed not in libraries, lecture halls or observatories, but in the fields and the laboratories. By establishing auxiliary campuses in agricultural hubs across the country can we ‘plant’ our students and researchers in the field and have them aid and learn from farmers directly. Local artificery laboratories, libraries and botanical gardens will aid in spreading the best farming techniques and latest insights in agricultural discoveries."

 H61_patronage_from_the_church_title: "Patronage from the Church"
 H61_patronage_from_the_church_desc: "Science and faith are intertwined, for unraveling the truth is unraveling the machinations that were put in place by the one true God. It is therefore only logical to have the Ravelian Church aid us in scientific research and help them spread the faith and gather spiritual knowledge in return. The Holy Teachings will advance our students and nation even further!"

 H61_the_greatest_university_title: "The Greatest University"
 H61_the_greatest_university_desc: "Teachers and Rectors: hired, students: enrolled, campuses: built. Finally after years and years of construction, we have achieved our long dream: to build up the greatest university in the Ynn and Expanse and the greatest University on Halann when it comes to agriculture and agro-artificery. We are the undisputed experts on botany, agronomy and physiocratic economy. From all over the world, students and researchers flock to the University of the Dame to learn about the latest advancements and research in the field of agriculture and its related fields. Get the marching band and your voices ready, and sing along!\n\nRally sons of Holy Dame:\nSing her glory and sound her fame,\nRaise her Gold and Teal blue\nAnd cheer with voices true:\nRah, rah, for Holy Dame…"

 H61_the_mystery_of_the_proto_sarda_title: "The Proto-Sarda"
 H61_the_mystery_of_the_proto_sarda_desc: "Before modern day Sarda, there were the Proto-Sarda. And while we have been studying them for a while, a lot of mystery still surrounds them. Our researchers, looking for clues, have now come forward with a theory; that the Golden Dome is of Proto-Sarda origin and that it may hold the answers we are looking for. They request that we either move the dome to Plumstead City, or that we set up a facility in Stanyrgard in order to conduct the research there."

 H61_clues_and_research_title: "Clues and Research"
 H61_clues_and_research_desc: "If we want to find out why the dome was moved, we must find the place from where it was moved. And to do that, we will need more support. We will employ the brightest minds the UotD has to offer to find out where that damned dome originally stood. Geologists, petrologists and archeologists will be hired to pinpoint where that glimmering enigma was first laid. It must be done if we are to unravel the mysteries of the Proto-Sarda."

 H61_the_place_of_the_society_title: "The Place of the Society"
 H61_the_place_of_the_society_desc: "The Plumwall Expeditionary Society has come a long way from its inception and initial expeditions into the ruins of Old Damenath. Now, there is an endless expanse, full of long lost history from the times of the precursors. The society shall have a proper home here as well, in order to search the depths of the past."

 H61_first_ynnic_expedition_title: "First Ynnic Expedition"
 H61_first_ynnic_expedition_desc: "Our first destination for study in the Ynn is the site known to us only as "Adbrabohvi", where according to information gleaned from our local natives is a location of great holiness. All that visit must commit to oaths and rituals before entering, and have mystical ‘water rituals’ for those that have died. By finding and exploring this locale, perhaps we can gain more information on the civilization calling the Ynn its home?"

 H61_down_the_path_of_gold_title: "Down the Path of Gold"
 H61_down_the_path_of_gold_desc: "Rumors have long circulated of a "Path Of Gold" from which gold literally physically flows. We must mount an expedition into Haraf in order to discover the truth behind these legends. We shall befriend the natives, scout the area and set up trade routes in order to find out where this mythical "path of Gold" is located!"

 H61_fragments_of_truth_title: "Fragments of Truth"
 H61_fragments_of_truth_desc: "When the Ravelian Society arrived in Plumstead City we welcomed them with open arms. It was a  society which, like ours, looked for truth and knowledge, and which was willing to go the extra mile, in both a figurative and literal sense. Now we have received the offer to set up a local chapter from which the society can aid in our research, expeditions and overall national development. It is an opportunity we cannot deny!"

 H61_the_whole_truth_title: "The Whole Truth"
 H61_the_whole_truth_desc: "When the God Fragment was found, we held our breaths. We hoped that it would uncover more fragments of the truth, but we could not have predicted how many more. When the truth of the one true God was revealed, we did not hesitate. We immediately threw ourselves behind the Ravelian cause with unrelenting confidence, but could not have known how much knowledge we would be gifted. In the name of the one true God, of science and of knowledge, will we uncover the truth!"

 H61_clerical_work_title: "Clerical Work"
 H61_clerical_work_desc: ""As in common life one marries out of faith, caring and the hopes for a better future, so must the state do as well. The state must embrace faith to care for its people and provide a better future. A matrimony between the state and the faith will be beneficial to both, and to the common people as well. By letting the clergy take on matters of state, will we be able to truly embody this matrimony and will we be able to steer the ship of state into a land of greatness and piety." ~ Archprovost Sumandriel in The Matrimony of State and Sacred"

 H61_prayer_and_works_title: "Prayer and Works"
 H61_prayer_and_works_desc: "Following the Ravelian faith entails more than just reciting prayers to God or the saints, we must emulate them. We can achieve this through doing good works, like pursuingscientific research, helping the needy and enlightening those who live in the darkness of ignorance. Only by acting like saints can we show our devotion to the faith and to God itself. The first step in this is having our realm being governed and our people guided by those who spend their lives devoted to faith and knowledge; the Rectors."

 H61_the_eccentric_minds_of_cathfei_title: "Eccentric Minds"
 H61_the_eccentric_minds_of_cathfei_desc: "Every university has its own culture. Some universities are more rigid and strict, focussing on structured and by-the-books research to ensure quality. Others promote creativity and initiative, as long as it helps the nation and the university. The University of the Dame on the other hand has a more hands-off approach and allows the most eccentric and bizarre ideas and theories to be tested. Whether it is a theory or practical application, all are welcome in Plumstead. All who enroll at the UotD, whether structured or chaotic, share one goal: the betterment of society and the discovery of the truth."

 H61_preparations_and_funding_title: "Preparations and Funding"
 H61_preparations_and_funding_desc: "While our researchers are working ‘round the clock to find out where the dome of the Proto-Sarda originally stood, another group should prepare for the physical search. We must prepare an expedition by training men for the possibly long and dangerous journey. Besides that, food needs to be prepared via preservation and equipment needs to be bought or produced. While expensive, the benefits should, according to our expectations, far exceed the costs of this expedition. So stock up and get the men ready to set off!"

 H61_one_last_expedition_title: "One Last Expedition"
 H61_one_last_expedition_desc: "Everything is ready. Pots have been filled, barrels loaded upon the carts, equipment checked and stored. Our men have been trained for this, a last expedition and one to hopefully remember for the ages. We will find the fabled vault of the Proto-Sarda and its contents!"

 H61_into_the_vault_title: "Into the Vault"
 H61_into_the_vault_desc: "Finally we found the damned vault. It took us quite some time and a journey across plains, over mountains and through rivers and even a lake - only to find out that the entrance of this damn vault has been flooded. We have already started to ask the mages and artificers what can be done, and they have given us two proposals: the first  is to use magic spells that allow us to dive into the vault, though this will be a tough job, as the spells work for only a limited time, besides which we are not a nation with a lot of diving experience. The second option is to drain the lake itself, revealing the entrance and making it a lot easier to enter and explore the vault, which while easier on our expeditionaries will cost significantly more, and the preparations and draining itself will take up a lot of time too."

 flavour_plumstead.1.t:0 "The Dawn of Plumstead"
 flavour_plumstead.1.d:0 "Adelar stands on his porch overlooking most of the town. For a couple of years, the Plumwall Exploratory Society has worked hard to turn this little encampment into a true town. Walking towards the townhall he encountered a few other familiars and chatted with them for a while. "Today is the day, is it not?" The man referred to the voting that would take place today, one which would decide the structure and name of the nation they were about to declare. Adelar nodded and continued his walk towards the townhall. Arriving, he gave his staff, marked with the names of all his expeditions, to the guard. He was ready to give his speech.\n\n"Dear friends, today we stand before an important yet difficult task. Today we are to decide what our nation will be, both regarding it's name and government. And so I stand before you to give my blessing to the proposal to become a nation of wisdom, to find all the knowledge there is to be found in the Expanse and the Ynn, and to cherish and share this with the entire world. I also support those who wish to settle down, work hard and build up a living on farmlands. We must support these homesteaders, so they may in turn feed and support us. Lastly, regarding the name. I have given this a lot of thought and want to share with you my proposal: "Plumstead".\nThis name should you choose it, would be a symbol of the union between the wisdom seekers of the society and the hardworking farmers and homesteaders. It would in my humble opinion be the best of both worlds and show the world what we stand for." Adelar then stepped down from the pulpit under overwhelming applause. And as Adelar had hoped, happened. An almost unanimous vote occured and as such the future of this young nation was decided. This great republic would now be known as "Plumstead"."

It is therefore time for the state to step in and decide what will be done with the massive surplus of plums we are currently in possession of. A few options are available to us.\n\nWe could give the excess harvest to the large brandy distilleries and give them the licenses required to produce even more brandy than they already do. This would boost our prestige and the popularity of our plumbrandy across the continent significantly.\n\nA second and quite noble option is to give the plums to the poor and needy so they may fill their bellies with the healthy and tasty fruits of our benevolence.\n\nA third option is to sell the surplus in bulk, and while the price of plums would in that case be extremely low, it would still grant us a quick buck.\n\nThe last option is to instruct our farmers to give the excess plums to our livestock, which would bring the benefit of having healthier animals."

 flavour_plumstead.6.desc:0 "A child pulling at their mother’s dress asking for more candy, a group of Ynnic merchants cheering for their favorite jockey, an Epednar and a steadsman plummeting to the ground after a twelfth round of brandy. After all these years, it has finally returned once more - the proving of the plums! The grounds of the festival are large, by some accounts larger than ever. While originally just a competition to see who has the best plums and plumbrandy, the Proving of the Plums has in recent decades transformed into something more; a celebration of the hybrid culture of Plumstead, of steadsfolk, Epednar and Ynnics. A symbol of unity through diversity. \n\nBesides the proving itself, activities and goods are abundant and diverse: food stands deliver us delicious snacks like plumcrisps, plum-cottoncandy and cornworgs; large halls filled with tables and kegs bring us the most delicious plumbrandy from each corner of the realm; a big running course cuts right through the fairgrounds and can only be crossed by large wooden bridges on which the betting offices and large fixed spy glasses reside; the central square is filled with peculiar devices and machines like the ‘carousel’, a large spinning platform, invented by a group of students of the UotD or the ups’n’downs, a machine with seats or a vertical wheel which brings riders high into the sky before slowly descending back to the ground.\n\nBesides fun, there are also more serious options on offer,  like the lecture halls in which both intellectuals and commoners can hold lectures on a varied range of topics from agriculture to Ynnic history. Alongside this, there are a plethora of tournaments in gunnery, archery and horse riding, all of which are known to be extremely competitive and have in a few rare cases resulted in shoot-outs between frustrated competitors.\n\nSo what activity will we engage in this time? Will you go plum tasting to see who has the best crops in the land, or will you indulge in the delicacy that is plumbrandy? Maybe you’d rather attend a lecture, like this one on physiocratic agriculture or perhaps this, on Cannorian fashion trends? Unless  the artificed wonders from the UotD are more your style… or if you are competitive, why not take part in the horse races or the gunnery and archery tournaments.

We could not see them, not on the ridges of the overlooking plateau or in the distance, and this we later learned, was intentional. The "Runs Faster than Horses" tribe has in the last couple of years been the tribe with whom we interacted the most, even though that was at best sparse as well. They helped us set up some homesteads and in exchange we paid them a tribute of sorts. And while we had no expectations of the sort, these interactions slowly turned into a small trade network and gave rise to a growing trust between our people as a result. And now a new chapter in our relationship was to be started. And thus, our chief diplomat, Tristén Crosston, raised his voice in basic Epednar, declaring into the distance:\n\n"Salutations oh great chief, we have arrived and seek an audience with you! We ask you to speak in peace and in friendship as we have done for many years." It stayed silent for a while, until all of a sudden, a thundering roar of hooves was heard. A large host of Epednar came crashing down the plateau, shouting yells which to the untrained ear sound like war cries but to those familiar with the Epednar stand for greetings of power and trust. Surrounded by his warriors, the great chief of the "Runs Faster than Horses" tribe came forward. He planted his hatchet deep into the soil to signify his peaceful intentions. Our chief diplomat followed suit and negotiations were started. While the concept of official treaties remains almost entirely alien to the Epednar, a treaty was still signed in both oral and written form.\n\nThe first act regarded the full and eternal equality of human and ruinborn and the inalienable rights which both possessed like the right to property, equality before the law and the freedom of religion and tradition.\nThe second act stated that all ruinborn were allowed a strong degree of autonomy and that the tribes and Plumsteader government would start work on the creation of a system of autonomy and parallel governance for the tribes within Plumsteader land.\nThe third and final act regarded trade and bartering regulations and laws to prevent disputes between Epednar and Plumsteader merchants and ease the flow of trade.\n\nAfter the treaty was signed, and celebrations were held, Crosston asked the chiefs why they supported the creation of this treaty when they were traditionally wary of strangers, to which one chief replied: \n\n"When you came to the land we helped you because you needed help, and when our tribesmen crossed into your territory looking for food and shelter while traveling, you gave it to them. And this may seem common decency to you, but to those living on the steppes, it is a virtue which not many outsiders seem to possess. From the beginning we saw that you were different from the other outsiders and so we dared to act differently as well. And as of now, we do not hold second thoughts on our cooperation and hope that it will endure into the future."\n\n Crosston smiled and thanked the chiefs for their trust. He raised his cup and exclaimed to them:"

 flavour_plumstead.12.d:0 ""That's it? That is seriously the biggest creature you’ve ever seen in your own lands?" Crooked Ears laughed and almost fell off his horse when Rogier described the animals of his home region. To a Damerian, the bear was one of the most fearsome and most dangerous land animals to exist, alongside wolves or wild hogs. But to the Epednar these were nothing but small play. "I’ll show you a great beast, and then you’ll rethink what dangerous is." Crooked Ears said with both amusement and a slight hint of seriousness. Rogier was skeptical, even though he deeply respected the traditions and superstitious myths of his friend. "Yeah right, as if beasts can be as big as some of your kin said, I don’t believe you. Whales, the size of hills or even mountains which devour whole villages? Those are just landslides, nothing more."\n\nThey continued their travels, Rogier cart being filled with a menagerie of pots, pans and other metal trinkets which Crooked Ears had bought for his family and friends. And then all of a sudden, a loud roar was heard, one which did not seem to die down, it instead only seemed to get louder. And before either could act, they were flanked by a group of Epednar, who rushed towards the noise. "What is going on?" Rogier asked. Crooked Ears answered, with a smirk: "Well, "a landslide", or as we call it "Posakawa". Let us wait here, so those men can deal with the whale." And when it came crashing down just mere meters in front of them, Rogier couldn't believe what he was seeing: A massive whalelike creature, with a skin of stone rushed down the slope, Epednar hunters following it down with spears and ropes. They hunted this great beast not only to use it for food, materials or rites of passage, but also because it could destroy a whole village in just one "slide" if they were not careful. And so Rogier became one of the first Plumsteaders who could verify the existence of the Posakawa Whales to the Plumsteader government. He warned them that even Plumstead City itself could be at risk and advised the state to be vigilant and watch the ruincliffs and the mountains where the beasts were said to reside."

 flavour_plumstead.13.d:0 ""And these really work? Against those beasts?" The ruinborn hunter was skeptical, yet Rogier replied: "they work to stop the debris yes, not the beast itself, as that is something which you have already mastered long ago."\n\nRogier smiled when he saw the hunter suited up in what could only be described as a ragged harness. A pan became a makeshift helmet with its handle forming a nose guard. Bent plates covered the shoulders, knees, and arms, while a large tray was fastened to his front. "With this, no pebble nor rock will knock you down and no whale will be able to bury you into the ground." And while it may look strange, Rogier and Crooked Ears were onto something. They knew that these plates and pans wouldn’t stop a well trained foe, but this was not the point of the equipment. The point was that this equipment could deflect the debris that was flown around by the great stone whale while it crashed across the plains and down the slopes.\n\nAnd finding out if it worked came quicker than expected as mere minutes later, as Rogier and Crooked Ears were loading up their stuff, an Epednar scout rushed into the village, calling the alarm that a Posakawa was on its way. Without a second thought, these "Raggedy Knights" mounted their horses and rushed towards the great beast. And in a pleasant turn of events, the equipment worked! The debris was easily deflected by the make-shift armor and the beast was brought down by a group of brave Epednar without any losses.\n\nAfterwards, the knights thanked the pair for their help and the equipment and even requested more so they could replace or repair their new kit whenever needed. And while the story was met with a lot of amusement and laughter in Plumstead City, the governing council still refused to take the whales that seriously, even though sightings had increased over the last weeks."

 flavour_plumstead.14.d:0 ""It’s coming, it’s coming!!"\n\nAs the dawn broke and people began their day, a lone cowboy entered Plumstead City in great panic. "A beast of unparalleled proportions, is coming towards the city! It is a whale, such as the locals warned us, yet larger than even they could imagine!"\n\nPanic ensued, and many feared that this whale, the size of a mountain, could annihilate the entirety of the Plumstead colony in one slide. The government, paralyzed by the fact that they had been warned before and that they had no measures put in place, issued a hastened evacuation to an area away from the likely path of the whale. And while the populace of Plumstead City went into a panicked evacuation, a lone Epednar knight stood afar, observing the chaos which gripped the city and the massive posakawa hurtling towards it. He  rushed towards the beast, clad in pots and plates, spear in hand. Flanking the majestic monster, the lone Epednar tried to get to the front of the beast, yet it was too fast. Thinking quickly, he jumped onto its back, the rubble crashing upon his armor like a rain of stone. He then ran forward on the back of the great beast, all the while his horse, free of the weight of the hunter, sped up to meet him at the front of the creature. Rocks and rubble flew towards the hunter, as if the whale tried to defend itself, yet he made it to the front. And with great strength and speed, he plunged the spear through the beast's eye. It surprised the beast so much that it flipped to the side, as if flying through the air. It crashed down on the ground, causing the spear to plunge even deeper into its head, killing it in the process. The hunter meanwhile jumped off the creature back onto its loyal and fearless steed and galloped to safety. The impact of the beast crashing down made the earth tremble, sending a massive dust cloud into the air.\n\nDead on the ground and the dust cloud settling, the inhabitants of Plumstead City came to see the beast themselves. Some immediately tried to climb on top of it, others looked for something to throw at the beast to channel their fears and frustrations over this monstrosity. And the lone knight? He left the scene even before he could be thanked, never to be seen again. Afterwards the government would set up better defenses against the posakawa and started to hire Epednar scouts to be on the lookout for these beasts. But all in all, one thing was clear, the Epednar had to be thanked for saving Plumstead one way or the other."

The messenger further explained that the chiefs would announce their arrival a few days in advance, as to give the hosts the ability to properly prepare. And so they did. A massive feast was to be organized, not only to thank the Epednar and their brave raggedy knights for saving the city itself, but also to commemorate the friendship between the two groups. \n\nThe freshest fruits and vegetables were to be brought in from the homesteads, the most delicious animals hunted and slaughtered and the most delectable forms of entertainment like cabaret, troubadours and storytellers were to be hired. A feast would be held which would forever cement the brotherly relation between the Steadsfolk and Epednar, one to give thanks to the natives for helping them in the hard early years.\n\n"Welcome my dear friends, feel welcome. Today we celebrate our friendship and thank you all for helping and saving our humble city from the horrific beast that was the Posakawa. There will be a grand buffet in the central square, enlightened by a thousand hanging lights and decorated with the most beautiful of bouquets and scenery.

But to the Auovonkyr, like to many of the Ynn, loyalty is earned through honor and blood. By showing you are a capable and good leader and a good steward to your people.\n\nAnd so the meeting between our generals and the Auovonkyr regiments was a surprise to say the least. We had expected them to fight until the bitter end to defend their home and faith, instead they came towards us, offering their blades and steeds. Their general, Varanik, informed us that we had shown not only valor in battle, but respect and honor as well. We treated those who were different as equals and allowed them to keep their traditions, faith and homes. We did not throw them out and steal their livelihoods, we incorporated them instead. And so, as the Auovonkyr’s original masters fled across the Ynn to protect their assets and wealth, the antler-horse riders decided that a new master was needed, which would be us. And so long as we respect the local traditions and religion, shall the Auovonkyr’s blades and steeds be ours."

We could of course force the locals to convert to our faith, yet not only would it have been a fool's errand which would unite all of the Ynn against us, it would have also been un-plumsteadly. We are a nation which celebrates diversity and tolerance, all because the different perspectives and traditions help further the advancement of science and knowledge. And so we have now made an official agreement with the local religious governance. The Ynnic River worshippers will be free from state interventions and in exchange, the priests of the faith will declare us as their sovereign protectors. We will pay for the upkeep and security of the dam, and in exchange, the local populace will enlist into our armies. We will also show grace and include their people into our administration and give them control over large parts of local Ynnic administration to ensure continuity for the people and ease any potential backlash. The Moonlit River Agreement will stand as a testimony to our tolerance and our embrace of differences, very much unlike the other settlers who seek to convert the local population and break the ancient traditions which the Ynnics hold so dearly."

 flavour_plumstead.23.d:0 ""Once there stood a city, graciously upon a river of mountainwater, overlooking fields of green with a dome of gold. Once." This is a small excerpt of an old Ynnic scroll which a couple of students from the UotD studied for their classes on "The History of Ynnic Calamities". They tried to find out where this once great city stood and by using other dusty scrolls and comparing descriptions of the earth they were able to triangulate a location of the fabled city, or at least what was left of it. And with their expedition greenlit, they set out to find the fabled proto-Sarda city. And after a long ride they arrived at the sleepy town of Paihubi. Baffled, one of the students said: "Really? This is where Domfanynn is supposed to be? This place cannot even be called a junkyard, so how can this be what is left?" The student leading the expedition snarked: "You will fit in perfectly then. No come on, it's an abandoned city. If there was still a bustling metropolis, it would not have just disappeared from the memories or records." After the camp was set up, and equipment unloaded from the wagons, then work could begin in earnest. But where to begin? They couldn’t just start digging randomly. So to make the work easier, they took samples from the soil and compared it to the few agriculture records they had from the proto-Sarda. And by employing this technique, did they eventually find a strange rock, one too square to have been natural in origin. "Wait, this ain't no rock, this is carved. We have to dig it out, quick, get your spades." And after digging for almost four days, did they uncover something remarkable. An old belltower, with carvings resembling those of the proto-Sarda. The group was ecstatic. They had done what nobody could have dreamed of, they had found the lost city of Domfanynn!\n\nLater, all of the students of the excavation group would become teachers at the UotD, with the group leader, Otó Ryefield even having the archeology department building named after him. This discovery, and the technique of soil sampling would become a standard part of Aelantiri archeology, as compared to records, the soil would never lie."

These have, according to the native locals, been here since time immemorial and had, for some reason lost to time been cared for by the locals. A strange habit to be sure, but also one which speaks to the local desire for remembrance.\n\nThis small town was known as Mara Luar. In the past it had been one of the furthest outposts of Ynnic Empire and had later on developed into a sort of Ynnic-Epednar hybrid town in which the two groups lived a relatively peaceful life of coexistence and at some times even cooperation. Mara Luar had for a long time been the Ynnics way of tapping into the resources of the Expanse and had been the center of trade for the Epednan Expanse. But the Epednar incursions into Ynnic lands under Hubinach slowly forced most of the Ynnics to relocate eastward, leaving only a token population behind. These survivors have, against all logic, attempted to keep the city as intact as possible, as if to cling to the past in the hopes of restoring it one day. Yet this culture of remembrance and preservation has given us a unique opportunity: we can study the history of the Ynnic and the so-called Ynnic-Epednar hybrid in great detail due to the many remnants of this once great town.\n\nWe have already done  extensive excavations, and some have laid bare very interesting facts about the region, which include the following:\nBefore the modern Epednar population, there was the Ynnic who controlled this area for at least 500 years.\nThe Epednar have not always lived in these regions, but have slowly migrated to this region from elsewhere with most academics agreeing on the "Haraf’ne theory of origin."\nThe Ynnics for reasons unknown, started the building of this town via a strict grid pattern but slowly abandoned it. This was possibly due to the increased need for housing during less safe periods.\nThe Expanse used to be a lot greener, with lush grasslands interspersed with forests here and there. Some even speculate that the lower slopes of the Ekyunimoy mountains were once covered in forests, though we cannot say this for sure.\nThe desertification of the Expanse was a quite rapid process, lasting only a few centuries at most.\nLastly, we have been able to deduce five different cultural periods of the Expanse with the help of clayworks and pottery, these being in chronological order: Early Old-Ynnic circle band pottery, Late Old-Ynnic slashband pottery, early Epedynnic knife-edge pottery, Early Epednar animal motive pottery and the current Epednar animal motive pottery.\n\nThese findings have all been written down by academics and students from the UotD and will be copied in both common tongue and in Ynnic and Epednari lingo, to help the native population preserve history."

We cannot let the tribes think that we pick one over the other so do not fret to arrest any agitators who may try to take revenge on those youngsters."\n\nMission in mind the small task force set out. Their job was simple; get the sacred ritual knife back and arrest the thieves before any fighting breaks out. And still it seemed strange that some kids stealing an old buried knife from a different tribe could spark calls to war and the senseless spilling of blood. It did however not matter, for if they failed, more tribes might get involved in this feud. Arriving at the village, the locals already seem to know why the soldiers have come. One local points us to the tent where the youngsters have gathered. And just as the captain is about to enter, a man calls to him: "You have no business being here! This is a tribal affair and you have no right to interfere, so leave." Shocked, the captain looks back to his tribal liaison who remarks that he is right, that technically, we have no right to interfere in tribal business. Some more tribal men, from both tribes arrive at the scene with a very clear message: do not interfere, or pay the consequence.\n\nNot wanting his men to get hurt, the captain orders the soldiers to pack up again and prepare to leave. But not before witnessing the ‘solution’ to the feud. The man who demanded the captain to leave storms into the tent and comes out a few seconds later, dragging the oldest of the perpetrators with him. He throws the kid, who is no older than sixteen to the ground, surrounded by men from the wronged tribe.

Revenge, blood feuds and deep seeded hatred are commonplace in the Expanse, and are now clashing with our own principles of justice and fair punishment."

A prime example of your tribe's traditions of debauchery, thievery and indecency," he shouted. The two then proceeded to exchange fists until their own students dragged them apart, regardless of the threats of failing their classes if they did not release them. Both academics were afterwards taken away by campus security and transferred to the municipal police.\n\nWhat had happened was clear from the start: a minor academic dispute had become mixed with tribal animosity between the two teachers and resulted in open fighting and accusations. Panavel, had according to Telar stolen research papers about the evolution of a small collection of streams in the Epednar. And though it may seem foolish that two would fight over this, the results of Telar’s research was that the creek, which denoted the border between the two academics respective tribes, had moved several hundred meters over its existence and that a small burial mound of Panavel’s tribe had been illegally build upon the land of Telar’s tribe.\nPanavel claimed that this was falsified and had taken the research papers to perform a "peer review" as she called it, though Telar claimed it was nothing but theft in order to cover up the findings.\n\nThe two continued to bicker from their cells to the point that two pickpockets requested transfer as the shouting match gave them insufferable headaches. When Telar and Panavel were released, the police warned them not to fight and the UotD has as of now suspended both of them and retracted their research rights. The UotD has also requested the government to make a decision regarding the validity of the paper, as the research grant for it came from the governmental land survey bureau."

And during the banquet, a large sculpture of a cow, filled with delicacies was wheeled in after which one of the Epednar politicians remarked that he had found his rival's cow, to which the reaction was an Epednar flying across the table. The two fought and while the guards were on their way, the crowd just cheered and stoked up the fight even more as the function had been lacking entertainment anyways.

And these bullets did not come from a hunter lacking aim or from bandits who had it in for lowly merchants. They instead came from Epednar who had been skirmishing with each other over tracts of land, land through which many merchants traveled. Both tribes had been firing upon merchants, in most cases because they thought that these merchants were from the rival tribe or in other cases simply because they didn’t want anybody on ‘their’ land. And as the merchants and travelers complained, the local government is unsure what to do. The laws of tribal autonomy forbid the government from interfering in tribal affairs, yet this affair is hurting non-Epednar and the local trade. So, not sure what to do, they petition the high courts to make the decision whether they are given permission to make arrests or to guard the caravans and be allowed to shoot back if they are attacked."

Two Epednar tribes, having been embroiled in a bitter rivalry over land for decades, had started to attack each other's lands and villages sporadically. And when a large group of young and hot headed Epednar decided to launch an all out attack, did the other tribe respond in order to stop them. The defending tribe won thanks to the veterancy of their warriors. A day later, the elders of both tribes went to complain at the local fort about the other. The attacking tribe demanded the return of their young warriors' possessions and payment for their burial while the other tribe demanded that the other was punished for launching the attack in the first place. While not wanting to decide over this, the fort commander did offer to settle the land dispute which started this whole affair. Though technically forbidden due to the autonomy laws, the tribes agreed that this was the best course of action and have now formally asked the government to make a verdict regarding the land dispute."

Curious, Marion grabbed a paper, though the front story shocked and silenced him too.\n\n32 Dead at Buffalo Skull Ranch\n\nFrom our reporter. On Buffalo Skull Ranch, just north of Plumstead City, rangers found what can only be described as a massacre. Thirty Two corpses of varying race were found. Hanged, lynched, maimed and defiled by the perpetrators in ways decency forbids us to describe. The perpetrators, which have yet to be identified but are thought to be of native origin have not made distinction between man, woman, child, human or ruinborn. They were all executed in what seems a coordinated and orderly manner, suggesting that this was a deliberate and planned massacre. No survivors were found and the ranch and the cattle, once the pride of the ranch owners, were either killed on the spot or taken away. The ranch buildings, including a nursing shed for weary travelers and a small tavern, were plundered and burned to the ground, the plumes of smoke mixing with the smell of death to create a perfume of pure wretchedness and tragedy.\n\nThough as luck would have it, the rangers did find a single survivor, who, though traumatized by the occurrence, was able to explain what had occurred and more importantly, why. She explained that the ranch, which was owned by a professor of the UotD, had been the hiding place of two of his students. These students were Epednari from two feuding tribes and had hidden their romance, fearing that they would be killed if their families found out, which happened eventually. Not knowing what to do, they asked help from their professor who offered them shelter until they could make up a plan. However, some other Epednar found out and notified one of the two lovers’ tribes, who subsequently attacked and massacred the ranch, killing almost everybody. The survivor only made it out because she had been plucking mushrooms just outside of the ranch.\n\nThe Rangers have now started a search party for the perpetrators, though no trace has been found as of yet. We will inform the reader of the latest news when it arrives. May the two lovers find peace and each other in the afterlife."

The chief representative of the Epednar tribes then spoke: "work will begin immediately, and soon, I hope to invite all of you to our new home!"\n\nCheers and yells were heard from miles around when they arrived, a thousand or more tribesmen, from all corners of the realm and from each and every tribe and subtribe. The warriors plunged their axes and spears into the ground at the ceremonial keeping grounds and the chiefs collected theirs at the central meadows, where the horses grazed and the highest dignitaries of the tribes gathered. A great circle of more than a hundred ceremonial hatches from chiefs great and small was formed, symbolizing peace and forming the literal center of what was to become Ciadhana, the City of the Epednar. Here the tribes would gather to mingle, exchange stories, gifts and promises. They would form friendships, ceremonial alliances and even love would bloom here.\n\nThe tribes would settle disputes, not through skirmishes but through diplomacy or organized duels. A special judicial committee of highly educated Epednar judges would take permanent residence and have jurisdiction over legal matters. Their education was taken care of via a special course at the UotD called Epednarian Law and Customaries. If a tribe was able to settle a dispute themselves, they would have it written down by the judges. If not, the committee would settle it for them, after which the Plumstead government had the full right to enforce it if necessary.\n\n.And not only were disputes settled in Ciadhana, it was also the centre of the Ravelian Church in the area. It was the place where Epednar clergymen would follow a special course on the customs of fellow tribes and receive their blessing to proselytize in the Epednar lands. And the city also hosted the Epednar Veridical, who would represent the Epednari tribes in matters of faith.\n\nAnd even though a lot of institutions were housed there, the city was not a city in the traditional Cannorian or Sardan sense. It was mostly a gathering of tents and mobile huts, as most tribes were still nomadic or semi-nomadic. And even though some would set up permanent residence in the city, they would still refrain from building a house, preferring a life in tents. This great tent city was therefore recognisable not by large illuminated homes but by the thousands of flickering fires from the thousands of elaborately decorated tents. It even boasted a special fire horse mounted fire brigade, which was funnily enough also housed in a large tent. To prevent confusion, most shop owners and innkeepers would build elaborate wooden or even brick facades to denote their profession or the purpose of their ‘building’, as behind the facade there was, of course, a tent.\n\nAnd so a city was set up and grew ever more. A haven of peace and unity in a world which sometimes seemed to harbor only resentment and strive. A city for the free folk of the plains, A city of the Epednar."

It was said to reside high in the skies, bringing thunder and lightning wherever it roamed, and gifting rain through its presence. This majestic bird commanded reverence and could humble even the fiercest warriors. Legends spoke of its strength, capable of hoisting a Posakawa whale into the air, devouring it atop a mountain, leaving nothing but bones behind. The thunderbird only revealed itself to express approval or disapproval, unleashing lightning bolts from its talons that painted the sky in breathtaking circles, both large and small.\n\nThe chiefs, equally astonished, saw this sighting as a divine sign of approval from the heavens. They had painstakingly forged lasting peace between the tribes and sealed it here in Ciadhana. The appearance of the heavenly bird, they believed, signaled God's blessing and approval.\n\nThe Epednar clergy swiftly proposed a pilgrimage for the Epednar people, a sacred journey starting at Paihubi and culminating at a shrine erected on the very spot where the thunderbird had graced them with its presence.\n\nMeanwhile, the city guard wasted no time in adopting the thunderbird as their emblem; a golden, stylized representation on a dark green oval symbolizing the sacred bird that soared above, guarding the green plains on which their city stood."

They then start the washing ritual, mouths and nose first, then head, neck and ears and finally their arms, legs and feet. All in one continuous motion, all while a priest recites a prayer.\n\nIt was a strange request, to first be blessed by the river before being allowed to visit the holy city, but as explorers and men of science, they agreed. The Ynn Worshippers believe that all who visit Abrabovhi, must first be ritually cleansed and blessed by the river itself. If one cannot perform the ritual themselves, one must help them and if one cannot or refuses to complete it, then they will not be allowed into the city. At the gates of the city, each must wash themselves with water from the river, after which a priest will give them a token to show that they have completed the ritual.\n\nThe exploration party under Adelar Longstaff proceeded into the city, which was unusually clean. The streets were constantly cleansed with water and soap. The sale of food and drinks outside was strictly forbidden and most people walked barefoot on the cobblestones of the main promenade leading to the paramount temple. The city itself was built as a planned city. The shape of a semicircle, with the flat end on the riverbanks and the Great Dam in the middle. Almost the entire riverbank was filled with temples and shrines, the Paramount Temple in the upper north, and the ‘funerary harbor’ as it was called on the southern end. All neighborhoods had a specific purpose, from the sale and production of food to the creation of religious artifacts. All was planned out and placed alongside large promenades filled with trees, flowerbeds and poles with burning incense, giving the city an almost divine smell.\n\nApproaching the Paramount Temple, they were welcomed by a priest and a magistrate, who proceeded to give them a tour of the temple and the adjacent administrative park, from which the religious affairs of the Southern Ynn were managed. The expedition party was profoundly impressed by the rituals and management of the city, especially as most came either from dusty Plumstead towns or crammed and ‘less hygienic’ cities in Cannor. And while most listened to their ‘tour guide’, Adelar began to talk with an old temple cleric who had been following the group. They talked about how the religious practices of the city impacted the daily lives of not only the residents of Abrabovhi, but of the entire Ynn as a whole. How the importance of the river shaped politics and culture in the entire region. Adelar kept asking the old cleric questions about the relation between the people of the Ynn and the waterbound faith, as he had been profoundly fascinated by the local religion, so different as it was in almost all aspects from the Regent Court faith of the old continent. Keeping in touch with the cleric, Adelar would later visit the city again, wanting to find out as much about the local traditions as possible. He was utterly fascinated by the city. This city which was a jewel upon the waters, was always pristinely cared for and cleansed. A Sacred City upon a Sacred River."

Like many other nations in Aelantir, Plumstead had become a stronghold of the Ravelian faith from the second it was proclaimed by Torieth Godspeaker. From the beginning, the people embraced the faith which married science and religion into a harmonious union, fitting perfectly into the Plumsteader philosophy of science above all. And while the government had officially refrained from declaring itself Ravelian, many did now demand it to do so anyways. Only by proclaiming Ravelianism as the national faith, could the UotD and the Ravelian Church truly form a matrimony of science. And so, the Plumsteader government finally embraced the faith and declared Ravelianism as the official faith of the realm, even though they made it very clear that other faiths were still to be treated with respect and were still allowed to be professed. But most citizens, human or ruinborn converted of their own free accord anyway. They took with them old traditions which were adapted to the new faith, and just like before, the Dame was given a special place of veneration as an aspect of God itself. And that small lodge, turned church? That church would become the Holy Church of Saint Adelar Longstaff, the first proper church named after the first of many Plumstead saints."

The old lodges were turned into churches and so were the old temples to the Regent Court. The lodge in Plumstead City was even turned into the Holy Church of Saint Adelar Longstaff and was the first church in Plumstead named after a saint. The change of faith was almost instant and spread across the realm like wildfire. The church could from the moment it was founded count on Plumstead and its people.

Plunging themselves into the darkness, they quickly found the entrance and with the help of archeo-linguists were able to decipher how to get in. The vault was, as expected, fully submerged and filled with water as well. Swimming through the vault, they discovered that it was a massive complex with hundreds, possibly even a thousand rooms, corridors and halls. To make sense of the place and to prevent getting lost, they plastered a special glowing paste to the walls, forming arrows and symbols to help future divers make sense of this labyrinthian complex. There is much to be found, much to be studied, but with enough determination and potions, will we discover the secrets of the vault.\n\nThough there is one strange thing we discovered already: a carcass of some kind of massive fish, probably ancient as we doubt there is anything still alive down here.

 flavour_plumstead.68.d:0 ""Nope, nope, nope". A diver swam towards the door as he was chased by what can only be described as an oversized carp with extremely sharp teeth. Not quick enough, the diver got devoured by the fish like a pie is by a halfling. The others quickly hid, as they had no weapons to speak of. Thinking on their feet, they made makeshift spears to at least keep the thing out of reach, though this would only work temporarily. Cornered in a large and seemingly deep hallway, they decided to try to fight the beast as escaping seemed impossible. They stabbed the beast multiple times, though it just went on attacking and just swallowed the spears whole. Kicking and distracting the beast seemed to work only temporarily and the divers feared that their fate was sealed, becoming fish food for some geriatric overweight pond swimmer. But then they heard a roar, which had the carp stopped in its path and silent. And before confusion could even set in did a massive creature appear from the darkness and devoured the carp whole before disappearing into the darkness once more. Taking the opportunity, the divers immediately left the hall and closed the sliding door leading into it. On it they plastered ‘Big Fish, don’t enter’. They then left for the surface to tell their story and to warn the others to take weapons with them.\n\nWe haven’t encountered another carp as of yet luckily, but in case we do, will we try to lure it into that hall again."

But the most interesting and valuable of discoveries is what we have dubbed "the imaginatorium": A massive and tall hall, deep in the belly of the complex where we found thousands of artificer devices. Even more impressive was a sealed room which has miraculously stayed dry and contained the blueprints for all these devices. We are now emptying the hall, as there is a massive hole in the wall leading into the mountain and we don’t feel like finding out what dug it.

He is most well known for his theory of trait inheritance, which has become the leading theory in the field of agro-sciences worldwide. His Epednar background has allowed him to combine both human and ruinborn knowledge on agriculture and nature and combine techniques, theories and tales to come up with not only the largest botanical compendium ever written, but also write a massive amount of books, papers and lectures on the wildlife of the Expanse and the Ynn, and on the relation between intelligent species and plants throughout history.\n\nThough already of an older age, he is still full of energy and we are considering asking him to become the new minister of agriculture, so he may revise the current agricultural policies and improve our already blooming agricultural sector and keep us ahead of the curve."

And so, Saint Pahayon of Plumstead will be added to the growing lists of saints originating from Plumstead. A large cathedral bearing the Saint’s name has already been commissioned and the church has also released a description of what images of Saint Pahayon should entail; the Saint himself in the robes of a rector, in his left hand a bundle of scrolls to symbolize his many writings and treatises. In his right hand, a small knife with a handle made from the antler of an antler horse to symbolize both his ‘dissemination’ of the natural world and its machinations and his Epednar origins. An optional addition is that of a small antler horse calf, as Saint Pahayon is said to have saved one from a hunter's trap. One should in that case not forget to have the calf stand on a plum with one hoof, as to again symbolize the dual heritage of Saint Pahayon.

 flavour_plumstead.101.d:0 ""But where did it go?"\nThe class went silent after this question from Milon. Professor Tyaphon, the leading expert on Proto-Sarda history gave a smile and removed his glasses while slowly walking to Milon. "You tell me Milon? Because even though I've studied everything there is to study about the Sarda, I do not have a clue. And yes it bothers me, but at the same time, is this not what makes our field exciting. I might never know where it came from, but it is exactly the fact that there is so much still to uncover which makes our field exciting. Perhaps we will never find out, or perhaps some farm hick will suddenly stumble upon the "golden" clue to where the Proto-Sarda hid those last remnants of their society. Perhaps somebody in this class will discover it, now or in the future. The fact is that this excitement and the constant asking of questions is what drives us forwards in archeology and yet, that same question will haunt us until we have found an answer. But be warned! Every new discovery will give you even more questions to ask and mysteries to uncover. So, I don’t know where the remnants of the Proto-Sarda lie, but perhaps you will one day. Or at least use this question to keep you curious and inquisitive."\n\nMilon had studied the Proto-Sarda ever since he had heard about them. Being a massive fan of Professor Tyaphon and living close to Plumstead City, Milon had always dreamt of finding the lost remnants of the Proto-Sarda. These remnants, which the uncovered texts and art of the Proto-Sarda talked about, had to be somewhere in the Expanse, though where was the mystery. We didn’t even know what it was. Some suspected it to be a vault of sorts, in which the ancestors of the Sarda hid their ancient technologies, knowledge and artifacts. Others thought that it might be a lost city in some hidden valley. Milon wanted, no, needed to find out what it was and where, and he was about to stumble on a clue. \n\nMilon worked in an antique shop, both to keep himself surrounded by artifacts but also so he could pay for his studies. And while most items in the shop are either worthless garbage or falsified, one day, Milon did find something of worth. While cleaning it with shimmer oil, Milon got intrigued by a small golden stave, not much bigger than a butcher's knife. Inspecting it, Milon accidently dropped it, scratching it and revealing that the gold was just an outer layer. Carefully peeling away the gold, Milon discovered that the stave had a cold black second layer with inscriptions which looked Sardic, but were simply "off". Curious, Milon decided to go to the archeology library in Ryefield Hall, looking for a clue. And sifting through all the books, he finally found something. The writings were similar to those on the Golden dome of Domfanynn, though the writings on the dome could barely be read, as if there was something on top of it–Like an outer layer!\n\nMilon, without a second thought, informed professor Tyaphon. Knowing they couldn’t just start slashing on the Golden Dome, Tyaphon devised a plan to first spread interest and enthusiasm surrounding the finding of the inscriptions before officially making a request to start an investigation of the dome itself. If Plumsteader and Sarda high-society was hyped enough for the idea that they could find the lost vault, then certainly they could "damage" that dome for the greater good, right?"
 flavour_plumstead.101.a:0 "As the gold unfolds, so does another mystery."
 flavour_plumstead.106.t:0 "Studying the Dome"
 flavour_plumstead.106.d:0 "Roads were blocked by the large carriages with what seemed like the entire inventory of the UotD department of archeology as they went towards the Golden Dome. It was an organized chaos, one to finally uncover the secrets of the Sarda’s ancestors. Journalists and a large portion of the local intelligentsia gathered here as well, not wanting to miss a possible grand discovery. Professor Tyaphon, though normally not someone to skip media attention, decided that no journalist was allowed onto the site until further clues were found. He wanted to protect his young students so they could focus on the task at hand, and the UotD to prevent any of those same students from making bold claims or statements while working for the university.\n\nMilon was put in charge of the investigation. But while they were trying to peel back the gold, a protest broke out. A group of Sarda conservatives and cultural conservationists protested the project and claimed it was nothing but outsiders damaging their heritage to boost their own ego and prestige. Tyaphon, being half-Sarda, half-Epednar tried to explain that this investigation could lead to the finding of the lost remnants of their ancestors. And he even, in order to protect his students, proclaimed that if they were wrong, that he would take all the blame and would resign from his position immediately. And while some still protested, most accepted the promise Tyaphon made. \n\nThough Milon had a problem. He was certain that there was something underneath the gold, yet he had no idea how to get the gold layer to peel off like had happened with the stave. Clueless, he asked a friend who studied metallurgical sciences. And by recalling what he had done with the stave, his friend remarked that perhaps it was the oil that did it. He explained: "You dropped the oil-covered stave, it then fell and a very small crack developed. The oil seeped into the crack, and because the stave was as you said quite cold on the inside, the oil thickened and expanded, causing a part of the gold layer to peel away."\nThinking it might actually work, Milon made a small incision into the dome with a chisel and then poured in shimmer oil. And lo and behold, the gold peeled away on the edges of the incision. And after pouring on enough oil to fill the Ynn river, did the team uncover a layer of hidden inscriptions which looked just like those on the stave. But they still had no clue what they meant. Luckily, Tyaphon knew what to do. Being an academic and a rector of the Ravelian Church gave him access to resources like no other, including the aid of the clergy in convincing the local population to share more on the history of the proto-Sarda. And so a special group of Sarda and human clergy got tasked with a very simple mission: to get as much knowledge from the local populace on the proto-Sarda as possible. It would take some time but slowly they could piece together a rudimentary alphabet to translate the inscriptions on the dome. They were also able to deduce that the vault was not just used for treasure or knowledge, but to provide shelter to the elites of the precursors. All this information came from talking with the previously reluctant Sarda intelligentsia, the gathering of clues via archeological finds in the region and the gathering of old Sarda texts and scriptures. And with all this information, one location seemed to be the most plausible: Lake Taspasu. A lake deep in the Ekyunimoy Mountainrange and the source of the Isobel river. It is most likely a hard, long journey, though our archeo-topographs theorize that there used to be a path from Paihubi to the vault, one which we could try to follow. We just need to convince the University and the state to sponsor an expedition."

 flavour_plumstead.111.t:0 "Funding and Supplies"
 flavour_plumstead.111.d:0 ""We will need, well, a lot." The chairman of the Committee of Adventure Affairs seemed unimpressed by the answer given to him by captain Avery. And rightly so, as requests by adventurers to support expeditions were revised with extreme care and a very critical mindset. "Squandering the resources of Plumstead is not on the agenda mr. Avery, and so I advise you to come up with a more detailed and complete report regarding the needs of this expedition. Remember that it is the reputation of Professor Tyaphon and the support of the Ravelian Church are the reason this proposal is reviewed at all." Strict, and perhaps overly bureaucratic, the chairman further informed captain Avery that he had to give them a report from Professor Tyaphon about their research progress, alongside a list of gear and goods necessary to make such an expedition. A bit frustrated, Avery agreed and went to Professor Tyaphon for help. Together they came up with a report which was perhaps a bit ‘exaggerated’ regarding how far they were in their research, though by no means short or incomplete. "Just don’t tell them about those worms living on the other side of the mountains, or they might think we’re wormfood already," Tyaphon instructed. They also created a list of materials, goods and gear that they suspected was needed for the long journey. "You do realize that we are asking them for a small army right? You are asking for multiple regiments of men, and on top of that, a lot of food and equipment to keep those men going," Avery said with a hefty amount of doubt. Yet Tyaphon was unwavering as it was really necessary to go with such a force, else they might fail on the way to the vault.\n\nA few days later, Avery returned to the committee with a report and a list. "Thank you Mr. Avery, the committee will now review your report and after that we may ask a few questions to clear up any questions or things which are not clear to us. Nervous, Avery waited outside for what seemed like days. Finally, after a few hours he was called back into the committee room and presented with a verdict. The committee had decided to:"

Avery and Milon looked at the list that they had been given by Vincén. Being a former army logistician and old buddy of Avery, Vincén had been quick to volunteer for the expedition as it would not only allow him to go on a big adventure, but also give him a reason to come out of his early retirement. A tall, yet skinny man, and a mustache which would impress even the mightiest of dwarves, Vincén was old army stock, a Roarsfield through and through, perfect for an expedition on a scale this big. Milon however had some questions regarding the funding, as a lot of these things were not on the list that the committee had been given, to which Avery replied: "On the bottom of our report is stated that in case the committee agrees, that we can make additional costs if deemed necessary by a qualified expert on logistics." Vincén gave a smirk. He knew Avery and his antics. A truly cunning and shrewd adventurer captain. Vincén then continued inspecting and revising the list, in case there were some other ‘additional costs.’"

"You will each be assigned to a wagon and will have the full responsibility over it. If something is broken, you fix it, if something has to be replaced, you will either replace it yourself or you will ask for it." The men nodded. Most of these men and women had been on multiple adventures in their lives, and knew the risks, though never had they experienced an expedition like this. The scale and the danger of this expedition was unparalleled and had caused multiple folks to abandon the expedition before it even started.

A bit baffled by the brazenness of this Sarda, Avery replied: "And why should we do that?" Orynn smiled, took a chair and in a very slow and raspy voice replied: "I know those mountains like my back pocket. I’ve hunted exotic animals and creatures which do not exist outside of those peaks and I know how to kill them, something that you will need. I do not ask much, only that I can keep whatever beast we’ve hunted whole. I will even bring my own wagon with tools and arms to fight them."

We could really use somebody who knows the intricacies of language and the clues and hints that hide in them." Avery looked confused as he thought that Tyaphon was the leading expert on the Epednar, to which Tyaphon simply replied that history is linked to linguistics, yet is not the same thing. Professor Sumandriel, who was bored of his retirement and his grandchildren, had personally requested Tyaphon if he could join the expedition in exchange for getting the right to research any ‘linguistic treasures’ that they may find in the vault."

They would go into history as members of the greatest expedition Aelantir had ever seen. Captain Avery, being a true leader, would sit at the front on his trusted steed. Behind him came a few wagons of trusted adventurers, followed by the wagons of professor Tyaphon and research-assistant-student Milon. Their wagon was unlike those of the others, more or less a mobile research station with dozens of papers, books, maps and other items of interest, all to help them get to the vault. They were followed by a large group of wagons filled with food, mining equipment and the wagons of specialists like miners, engineers, mapmakers, doctors and even a few cooks. At the end was a large procession of adventurers and explorers who had volunteered for the expedition and who would do most of the hard labor like building makeshift bridges over creeks, pushing and pulling carts over steep slopes and taking care of the horses.

And so a wagon caravan of about a hundred wagons went on its way towards the slopes, towards the vault. Armed not only with weapons but with knowledge and enthusiasm, the caravan passed the final vestiges of civilization, beyond the Plumstead realm and beyond the Epednar lands. There would, from now on be no more outposts, no more refill stations, only mountains and the unknown. This is where the adventure truly started, the last expedition."

The caravan had to cross what they thought was a small creek, which in earnest it was, though they had not taken the wet season in account, which caused it to become a rapid. Thinking on their feet, a few lumber workers in the caravan started to cut down the few lone trees in the vicinity, while the engineer started to design a bridge with the few materials they had.\n\nAfter a few hours of cutting and dragging, the engineers could start on their design. "It’s not built to last an age, though I don’t expect us to be gone an age anyways." Confident in their ability, the engineers presented their creation. It was hoisted across the water by a few of the larger horses, which could traverse the rapids without trouble. Having been installed, the caravan slowly started to traverse it. And though the bridge slowly sagged and moved, no wagon fell into the river. "Shouldn’t we take it to this side, just to be sure?" Avery asked.

Yet before one could really hurt the other, Vincén and Biscuit stepped in. While Vincén demanded everybody to go back to their tasks, Biscuit, being a large half-orc, held the two fighting halflings under his arms. They were still trying to hit one another until Biscuit gave a stern grunt, warning them that he could do more harm than the both combined. Having calmed a bit they both explained why they thought that they were right and that the other was a lying cheater. They had been traveling for days without taking a longer time to rest, and the men were really feeling it. Talking to Avery, they decided that stopping for a whole day was the best course of action. Not only that, Vincén also came up with rules for gambling. Rule one was that all gambling activities were to be registered with names, type of game and investment. Rule two included the ban on taking loans or using future riches as investment. Rule three was that each game needed a neutral arbiter to make sure that nobody cheated. While a bit extreme perhaps, Vincén knew that these rules could at least keep up the veneer of civility between the men and hold everybody who gambled accountable. Writing down these rules, they would later be discovered by a military student of the UotD, who would introduce them into the Plumsteader army."

 flavour_plumstead.129.d:0 ""Avery, I need to speak with you." Orynn, a Sarda who had traversed these mountains many times, looked at Avery with a serious and stern expression. "These lands we are now riding into are the home of the Chiunife. It is a group of shapeshifters who don't take kindly to outsiders, be they human or ruinborn. They are some kind of strange cult who have resided in these mountains for ages. They prey on people who wander into the mountains and according to the stories, they reside in the mountains themselves, especially near the rivers. To the Epednar they are nothing but scary ghost stories meant to make children obedient, but I’ve encountered them, and not only are they real, they are nasty folk as well." Avery, contemplating for a bit, decided that they would count the men in the evening and that they would install a special code: one would say plum, and the other would say tree.\n\nThat night, the men were tense, fearing that their own friend could be a shapeshifter. Some closed off their wagon, others installed empty cans and pots that would make noise if one were to enter. Orynn just watched the waters, as if he knew what was about to happen. Then, some men shouted: "Man in the water!" They had seen a man on some piece of wreckage and tried to help him get to shore. Knowing it was a trap, Orynn shouted that they left the man alone, yet it was too late. With a fell swoop, the shapeshifter cut the throats of both men and jumped ashore. Orynn immediately sounded the alarms, as did Avery and Vincén. Yet before they could do that, multiple men got killed as shapeshifters jumped from the shadows and from the wagons. A battle ensued. Most shapeshifters were however dispatched quickly and those who did remain eventually fled back into the darkness of night.\n\nAnd even though all of this had taken only a couple of minutes, the damage was noticeable. Around thirty men were killed, and later they would find the bodies of more men in bushes and behind boulders surrounding the path. They had most likely been kidnapped and killed the night before, their bodies replaced by shapeshifters who had secretly traveled with the group for a whole day, perhaps more. The group had in total lost around fifty men, but the biggest damage was to morale, as many feared the return of the shapeshifters. Orynn could not say if they would return, suggesting that the password was changed each day, just to be sure."

 flavour_plumstead.130.t:0 "Expedition: Drunk Dwarves, Dry Days"
 flavour_plumstead.130.d:0 ""Where is the rum?" The chief cook of the expedition, a half-orc named Biscuit furiously searched through all the supply wagons to find the rum. He needed it for his recipe, yet could find only empty bottles. "We packed enough to have a whole halfling festival, yet it’s all gone?" He suddenly heard a hiccup and burp, a very distinctive drunk burp. Lumping into the wagon where the sound came from, he discovered two dwarves and around twenty bottles of rum. "Curses you drunk imbeciles! This was for everybody, and not just the two of you, you fat worthless pieces of mole rat." Furiously, Biscuit kicked out the two dwarves, who drunkenly tried to explain that they had just been ‘testing’ if the rum was still good. Biscuit wanted to kick the two drunk dwarves down the nearby ravine, yet was stopped by Vincén and Dr. Bitter, who had a better idea: These two dwarves were first of all stripped of all their liquor rations and secondly, they would have the cost of the rum deducted from their cut of whatever they found in the vault. On top of that, Biscuit had them made into his kitchen helpers and forced them to cut onions day in, day out."
 flavour_plumstead.130.a:0 "Are they crying because of the onions, or because they can’t drink?"
 flavour_plumstead.131.t:0 "Expedition: A Little Grub"
 flavour_plumstead.131.d:0 "Riding along the sandbanks for days, the men had frequently reported seeing the sands shift and move. Avery was dismissive of it, as sandworms didn’t live in the mountains. Orynn on the other hand was not so sure. Though he had never encountered them, he could see the creatures end up here, even if it was just a lone one. After a few days they had passed the sandbanks, yet just before it was out of sight, Avery saw something: A little sandworm grub, jumping across the sand. Perhaps those men weren’t crazy after all."
 flavour_plumstead.131.a:0 "We’ll let's hope that we won’t encounter them elsewhere."
 flavour_plumstead.132.t:0 "Expedition: That’s a Large Boulder"
 flavour_plumstead.132.d:0 ""No, we should just push it downward."\n"If we do that, we'll risk a landslide you fool."\n"No we won't."\n"Yes, we will."\nThe two, arguing how to get the large rock off the path did not budge, both very sure of their preferred method. Fimbur, a dwarf with almost a hundred years of mining experience, was convinced that the boulder would just roll down without taking the path along while the chief engineer feared that the soil was too loose and would move along with the boulder, creating a hole in the path. Tired of the two, Vincén lit his pipe, took a barrel of gunpowder and walked to the boulder and planted the barrel next to a crack. "Are you mad?" The two arguing men said. Yet before they could try to stop him, Vincén lit the fuse and calmly walked back to the carriages. "Hold your horses, cover your ears." A large blast followed and the big boulder split, creating a path for the wagons to traverse through. All the while, Fimbur and the chief engineer just stood there, perhaps a bit ashamed as Vincén’s solution was brutish, though effective."
 flavour_plumstead.132.a:0 "Big boulder goes boom."
 flavour_plumstead.133.t:0 "Expedition: Clippers and Stingers"
 flavour_plumstead.133.d:0 ""Scorpion!" The scout shouted while running back down the slope to warn the rest. Behind him a group of a dozen massive scorpion-like creatures, as big as wyverns, rushed down to get him and the rest of the caravan. Immediately, the men started to shoot at the beasts, but to no avail. Their bodies were somehow impenetrable to gunfire, and panic ensued. Orynn, knowing of these crawlers, immediately ran to his wagon along with Milon, where he opened a crate with two personally modified guns. "These weapons shoot a bullet, containing a special acid to burn their protective skin. Don’t waste the bullets, and aim for their heads." In the meanwhile, the creatures caused havoc among the men. Bodies were thrown through the air or were pierced by the large stingers and some had their arms or legs severed clean by the large claws. On Orynn’s order they had the beasts walk towards him and Milon, who then proceeded to shoot them down one by one. In the end they got them all, though not without losing around twenty to thirty men. On a positive note: these beasts are edible and taste like chicken - just don’t eat the stinger."
 flavour_plumstead.133.a:0 "Delicious! Finally, some good blasted food."
 flavour_plumstead.134.t:0 "Expedition: Go left near the big boulder"
 flavour_plumstead.134.d:0 "Whether it is because Avery had not been paying attention or because Tyaphon was not the best when it comes to giving directions in a clear and concise manner, the party took the wrong turn. This led them to walk into a large canyon filled with strange, oversized eggs. These eggs seem to be of the large scorpion-like creatures that roam the mountains. They couldn’t turn the wagons without disturbing the local fauna and so pressed on through the canyon. They were lucky and at the end of the canyon, they saw that the canyon had the shape of a semicircle and that if they followed the slope, they would return to the path they originally had to take, albeit with a few days delay."
 flavour_plumstead.134.a:0 "Sigh…"
 flavour_plumstead.135.t:0 "Expedition: Do not touch!"
 flavour_plumstead.135.d:0 "Aelantir is a land filled with a large variation of flora, and these mountains are no different. When they got to the canyon, they could immediately smell them, large mushrooms, puffing out spores whenever something touched them. Not knowing whether they were intoxicating or hallucinogenic, the party leadership ordered the men to not touch them and to bind a handkerchief in front of their face to keep the spores out. They slowly passed the mushrooms, yet for some reason, somebody had to touch them anyway. A ruckus was heard and Avery ran to the back of the wagon train, where he found a group of men lying on the ground, laughing uncontrollably. Amongst them was a naturalist, who had been unable to curb his curiosity and had tried to sample a bit of the mushrooms, releasing its spores. The men were taken to one of the infirmary wagons and one after the other they recovered. They explained that for some reason, everything they saw or heard became extremely funny to them, which explains their uncontrollable laughter. But for the naturalist, there was not a lot to laugh about. He had suffocated due to his laughter, having taken in a humongous dose of the spores."
 flavour_plumstead.135.a:0 "At least he can say that he had the last laugh."
 flavour_plumstead.136.t:0 "Expedition: Sweet ‘n Salty"
 flavour_plumstead.136.d:0 ""Why does it smell like that?" Biscuit was confused as the smell of something extremely sweet filled the air of the wagon. He was confused as the salt in the barrel was supposed to keep the meat dry, not sweeten it. Milon, who was passing the wagon, came up to see what was going on. He inspected the barrel and decided to taste the salt. "This isn’t salt? It’s sugar!" Biscuit was confused, yet in a strange sense also amused. For some reason, some fool had ‘salted’ the meat with sugar. It seemed to be that this was the only barrel which had been filled with sugar and so the two laughed it off. Biscuit was even able to make something out of this sweetened meat, even when its taste was a bit unusual."
 flavour_plumstead.136.a:0 "Sweet jerky sounds nice."
 flavour_plumstead.137.t:0 "Expedition: A bit strange, that’s all."
 flavour_plumstead.137.d:0 "He just stood there, waving at Avery. Approaching the strange individual, Avery took out his sword and warned the man not to come closer. The man, who seemed to be a human, did so anyway and introduced himself to Avery. "Well hello young man, I see that you have come with a large group, looking for the vault I suppose. A bit startled, Avery nodded. "Well good luck then, I haven’t been able to find it in all these years, and you probably won’t either. Just make sure that you keep your senses and don’t get lost." Before Avery could even react, the strange men walked off again and disappeared. It seemed like some had tried to find the vault before them and had lost both the trail and their sanity. Luckily he was harmless, though a bit strange."
 flavour_plumstead.137.a:0 "There is a fate worse than death here."
 flavour_plumstead.138.t:0 "Expedition: Boom!"
 flavour_plumstead.138.d:0 ""Run!" They could barely get away when the cart exploded. For some reason, a fuse on a gunpowder cart had suddenly gone alight, and its men barely made it out alive. Fearing sabotage, the party halted to investigate. They searched the wreckage and found the supposed perpetrator: a small crate with glasses. These had probably reflected sunlight upon an exposed fuse, causing it to slowly heat and then go ablaze. A freak accident, though a good lesson for the party who continued to inspect the other wagons to prevent such an accident from occurring once more."
 flavour_plumstead.138.a:0 "Who even put those glasses there?"
 flavour_plumstead.139.t:0 "Expedition: The Right Direction."
 flavour_plumstead.139.d:0 ""We should have gone right here, not there."\n"You are so wrong you know, we should have gone left!"\n"Then why didn’t you do that then, or are you too afraid to admit you are wrong?"\nTyaphon and Avery kept arguing, while the rest of the party just stood there, frustrated that their supposed leaders did not really know what way they should go. In the meanwhile Milon and Adolohn, an Epednari Explorer, tried to analyze the maps for clues on where they were and where they should go. And not long after they found what had happened. Both Tyaphon and Avery had been dead wrong, as they had completely underestimated some distances which meant that both their turns had not even been passed yet. The two were quite ashamed and Milon and Adolohn revised the maps to make sure that they would not get lost or make miscalculations."
 flavour_plumstead.139.a:0 "At least they didn’t hold the map upside down."
 flavour_plumstead.140.t:0 "Expedition: A Broken Sky"
 flavour_plumstead.140.d:0 "A thunderous sound was heard, when suddenly the skies broke and a massive amount of rain came crashing down on the party. While most men were delighted, Avery and Vincén immediately warned the men to stay on their wagons and secure them as sudden rains like these could cause landslides. And as they expected, it happened. A massive chunk of the slope they were traversing suddenly cracked and began to move. The men on the wagons were not quick enough to move the carts off the piece of land and were dragged down along. In the end, a few of the men and horses were still alive, though severely wounded. The carts were however broken and though they were able to recover some stuff, most were buried under the mud along with some twenty men and a dozen horses."
 flavour_plumstead.140.a:0 "Lets watch our step from now on"
 flavour_plumstead.181.t:0 "The Vault has been Located!"
 flavour_plumstead.181.d:0 ""Well damn." The party stood before lake Taspasu, where the vault was supposed to be. Captain Avery stood before the shore and threw a rock into the water out of frustration. "Where is that damned vault? It should be right here, but all we found was this lousy lake!" Feeling defeated, the party set up their camp, as going back empty handed was a no go. And while scouting the area, a few men stumbled upon a strange monolith protruding from the lake. It was irregularly rectangular and seemed to be decorated with gilded carvings. Tyaphon and Milon decided to inspect the strange monolith and made a baffling discovery: the vault, which they had been looking for, was indeed here, though there was a small problem: The entrance was located underwater. Mixed feelings gripped the party leadership as they had indeed found the vault, though it seemed to be inaccessible. They immediately send a message to Paihubi with a question: how to get into the vault?"
 flavour_plumstead.181.a:0 "Let us consult the mages and engineers."
 flavour_plumstead.191.t:0 "Expedition: Lost and Failed"
 flavour_plumstead.191.d:0 "It had been a few years since the expedition had set out. And while they knew the risks, some men decided to go look for the lost expedition anyways. Eventually they found a wagon near a cave. Entering it, they were greeted by a dozen dead bodies, dried by the harsh sands. They had as it seemed died from starvation. In the back of the cave they found the body of a young man, Milon.Under his head was a diary which read:\n\nDay 473, Ever since Avery and Tyaphon split and decided to follow their own paths have things deteriorated. We lost more men everyday, some went mad, some just walked off. We have found a cave to stay in for now, but we have no idea where to go."\nDay 498, We have not been able to figure out where to go at all. We should have done more research, why didn’t we do more research??"\nDay 499, I’m thirsty, I’m hungry, I’m just going to lie down for a while, the ground feels soft here and my diary is a good pillow."

Eventually they found a wagon near a large canyon. In the canyon they found the bodies of dozens of men. Some had lost their limbs, while others had knives in their bodies. A strange sight as even though some seemed to have been stabbed to death, it didn’t really look like a fight. They searched until they found something which shocked and repulsed them: A campfire, and upon it the remains of a man, roasted above a fire. They found a diary in one of the wagons which read: "Day 321: We are out of food, have been since ten days. After careful consideration and a vote with all the men, we decided to resort to cannibalism. Everybody, including the party leaders will pull a straw to see who will be chosen. If we are lucky, we will be able to hold out just in time before we make it to the vault. Let’s hope that there is food in the vault."

 flavour_plumstead.202.d:0 "Trade on the steppes is a bit primitive sometimes, as both our merchants and those of the Epednar have different ideas surrounding what is valuable and what is less so. One such conflict occured after a group of Epednari refused to buy the ‘snake oil’ remedies and elixirs from a merchant, even though they had tried them. The salesman demanded that they buy his goods, while the Epednari found him to be a fraud. Both sides now claim to be the victim, with the Epednari feeling scammed and the snake oil salesman feeling robbed of his income."

Drunk on ego and alcohol, the shaman agreed and the two went outside to find out who the better magician was. They battled each other with half baked spells and even less sharp insults until they both dropped down from exhaustion and intoxication. Though they did cause a lot of damage to the local town with their uncoordinated attacks and fire spells. We have detained both mage and shaman, infuriating the tribes and the mage estate who both claim self defense."

Sadly we cannot arrest every law breaking adventurer as a group of adventurers have stolen some jewelry and sacred tools from a tribe. They have already disappeared and we doubt we will ever be able to arrest them. The tribes in turn are furious that we have not put in the extra mile to get the thieves."

 flavour_plumstead.301.d:0 ""Who is this young man, erh, half-orc?" Tyaphon stood here, inspecting the Half-Orc for any weapons when Avery replied: "he’s our cook." Tyaphon, ever the academic, dismissed the idea of needing a cook immediately, calling it frivolity which would only distract from getting to the vault. Avery replied: "sir, we are going on a large journey through inhospitable terrain and across mountains as high as the firmament, you are going to need a cook who can make a good meal to keep the men happy. Besides, if anybody knows how to make a lot of food with limited resources, it's Biscuit. "Biscuit?" Tyaphon looked almost mortified when he heard the name of the Half-Orc. Avery explained: "He got this nickname from the soldiers who adopted him when he was just a little urchin. He was trying to steal their biscuits but instead of punishing him for it, they just made them a kitchen help in their fort where he learned to cook and fight." Biscuit smiled and reassured the professor that he was a good fit for the expedition. They only needed Tyaphon’s approval."

His companion, Dr. Bitter, a medical doctor and expert in industrial and mining related injuries smiled. "Forgive my dwarven friend for his enthusiasm on rocks. It may not be the most riveting of topics, but I can assure you that he can indeed dig through every obstacle on the way to the vault." The two men further introduced themselves to Avery, Tyaphon and Milon and explained why they wanted to join the expedition. "We’ve for a long time traveled from mining town to mining town, and even though Fimbur’s expertise on mining and my knowledge on remedying mining related accidents brought us a good income, we do crave more adventure. Seeing your call for adventurers, we simply couldn’t say no and hope you agree!""

Avery was furious, he had expected that his own personal adventure band was to go along with them, it made sense. Tyaphon reminded him that he had hired Avery, not his whole band. They two men were angry as both felt cheated by the other. Fed up, Milon scolded them both and said that they should make up their mind before the whole expedition went to ruins. Shocked, though also impressed by the young students' boldness, they nodded. Tyaphon made it clear that he preferred soldiers from the army to go along with them, as the government was the largest sponsor of the expedition while Avery insisted on the use of his own men as he was to lead the expedition. Not able to get to a compromise they asked Milon to decide, with the promise to respect the decision."

As the professor approached, he immediately started to talk in Epednari tongue, greeting the young woman and thanking her for coming. He further explained: "Milon, this is Adolohn the Explorer. She is an old student of mine and is now one the best Explorers in the whole Ynn and Expanse. She can help us find the path when we cannot seem to find it. She will go along, paid with adventure and an excuse to get away from her arranged marriage. But don’t tell anybody else about that.""

And while many Rectors are, because of this, central to the daily workings of the community, they were initially ineligible to run for office due to a strong separation between church and state functions.

Ruled by the greatest minds, who in Plumstead are required to have a theological schooling as well, the Plumstead Technocracy favors the advancements of science and faith above all else and sees them as one and the same. The premier science in the land, and therefore also the most common academic background of our rulers is that of agroscience, which has over the last century evolved into Plumstead’s number one field of expertise. From soil research to state of the art farm automata, Plumsteader agrotechnology is leagues ahead of the rest of the world, leading to the nation sometimes being called an ‘agro-technocracy’. It also puts a strong emphasis on the protection and expansion of the faith, stemming from their own roots as settlers in a strange and at many times hostile land."
