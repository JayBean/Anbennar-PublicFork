 khao_elnak_2_1_title:0 "Friends in Lo Ngoen"
 khao_elnak_2_1_desc:0 "While the relations with Rama Buakae have been relatively short given his recent election, it seems like Mya has made quite the impression on Lord of Lo Ngoen. While some would look at this kind of unrequited feeling as a problem, our Lord seems to be quite happy with the situation, looking forward to manipulate the inexperience of our ally’s leader.\nIf everything falls right into its place, no one will even notice Rama giving away his Township right into our hands with a big, loving smile on his face."

 khao_elnak_2_3_title:0 "End of An Age"
 khao_elnak_2_3_desc:0 "In the prior war, Thirabnir chose to not intervene on either side of the conflict, citing a policy of neutrality. Unfortunately for us, even if they want to pretend otherwise, everyone knows that when push comes to shove, they will inevitably side with Hiderion. That said, their beloved Lord is old and very likely that he will perish soon, giving us an unique opportunity to place someone more suitable for our interests. And well, if that doesn’t work, we will just have to make sure they understand the consequences of the error that they’ve made."

 khao_elnak_3_1_title:0 "Defending Our Privilege"
 khao_elnak_3_1_desc:0 "Humiliation. That is the only word which can describe what happened 3 years ago. A tragedy born of our own hubris, as despite having a crushing numerical advantage, we suffered an outstanding loss in the battlefield, forcing us to negotiate a premature peace deal in which we’ve lost our most renowned stables. \nNow, with Purebreds in Azkare’s arsenal, we have to make sure that we at least match their numbers, if we are to stand a chance in a direct confrontation that might as well decide it all."

 khao_elnak_3_2_title:0 "Avenging Lektonmai"
 khao_elnak_3_2_desc:0 "Soon, the hostilities between us and Azkare will begin anew. We did our best in the past five years to prepare for this moment, securing a stronger network of alliances, so make sure that this time we will stand on top. Our agents, placed inside of our enemy’s borders are on their marks ready to act whenever we give the sign, igniting a rebellion in our prior holdings. It’s time to make Hiderion pay."

 khao_elnak_3_3_title:0 "Formalize Red Mares"
 khao_elnak_3_3_desc:0 "Mya always loved to gossip with her friends, discussing among many things trends, men and well… the usual. After all, she always felt at ease in many courts of Haless, making a large network that secured favourable information for her through seemingly trivial, but unconventional methods. And now, with the most pressing matters figured out, isn’t it time to change the environment from the glares of foreign spies residing inside the palace, to a nice ladies’ stroll on the horseback? It would be nice for once to discuss the future policy of the state in fresh air."

 khao_elnak_3_4_title:0 "Thangoya Secured"
 khao_elnak_3_4_desc:0 "It wasn’t the cleanest period in our history, but at the end of it all, we managed to stand our ground. The banner of Khao Elnak and the Saetae family proudly waves over the Townships, marking the end of the wars that Hiderion started. That said, while the fight in the open field has stopped, many people came back to the methods that kept their states intact from threats bigger than ours. If we don’t want to get slowly chipped away by guerilla warfare, we need to quickly figure out a system that will satisfy all sides, lest we risk falling as quickly as we rose."

 khao_elnak_4_1_title:0 "Finding a Guarantor"
 khao_elnak_4_1_desc:0 "While we value our current alliances, the recent events showed us that they’re not sufficient to keep our country safe from threats as small as Azkare was back then. If we are to survive in this work as the citizens of Khao Elnak, we need to find an outside power with which we can find a long term relationship with.\nLuckily, many suitors already send gifts to our Lord, deeply interested in both her beauty and her domain. In this jewelry market, all that we have to do is to find the most finely crafted ring, to serve as a reminder that this country is protected by an influential husband."

 khao_elnak_4_3_title:0 "A Symbiotic Bond"
 khao_elnak_4_3_desc:0 "With the marriage between two heads of states finalised, both sides expect much from the newfound arrangement, as we both have ambitions that could be enabled with a few more troops under our belt. While we will obviously have to make some compromises to our stronger ally, there is still a need for us to step up and reinforce the bond, as it is in our interest to keep this alliance going for as long as possible."

 khao_elnak_event.1.t:0 "The Lonely Lord of Lo Ngoen"
 khao_elnak_event.1.d:0 "In an inn between the borders of Khao Elnak and Lo Ngoen, a meeting has been scheduled between Lords of both Townships, to discuss their strategy for the upcoming years.\nThe two sit down in the designated room, created specifically for the purpose, as they have anticipated this moment for a long time. After all, the truce between them and Azkare is about to end, so it may as well be the last time they meet.\n\n“I’ve called you to discuss a treaty of greater cooperation between the two of us” - Mya said as she handed the document to Lord Rama.\nHe reads through the document as thoroughly as he can, yet unfortunately for him it is written in a deliberately confusing manner, making it impossible to understand for a man of his education. \nThat said, the outcome of it was kept relatively simple. The Lord of Khao Elnak was to receive the sole right to represent Lo Ngoen, while allowing Lo Ngoen to lead a unified chain of command for the upcoming war. \n\n“You’re asking me a lot, you know?” - stated Rama\n“Yes, I do.” - Mya nodded - “But look at this from the other side, we both get to do what we do the best. I lead the courts and you lead the army. Don’t you agree, my dear ally? ”\n“I think I am going to regret this but yes, dear, I do."
 khao_elnak_event.1.a:0 "Then I’m glad we came to an agreement."
 khao_elnak_event.2.t:0 "Head of The Family"
 khao_elnak_event.2.d:0 "Following the events of the recent Dauloph feast, our Township lost its charismatic leader but gained a powerful ally to protect its interests, which was exactly what we expected out of the cooperation with the Saetae family. \nYet, it seems like their interest in our affairs seems unfinished, as Mya’s father just arrived in our courts, offering to lend his leadership, along with favourable offers towards mercenary companies owned by him."
 khao_elnak_event.2.a:0 "Why wouldn’t we agree to such an offer?"
 khao_elnak_event.3.t:0 "What Goes Around"
 khao_elnak_event.3.d:0 "The decision that was made during the recent visit to Lapnam Amrik was not one that Mya made lightly. After all, her escape from the Dauloph feast stained her family’s reputation, deeply needed to keep their mercenary business flowing. It seems now that they came to get their recompensation, as most of them came right to her gates, her father requesting refuge. While this is an offer Mya can’t refuse, the better question is what will they do for a living here?"
 khao_elnak_event.3.a:0 "Father would serve well in the field"
 khao_elnak_event.3.b:0 "Father would serve well in the warcamp"
 khao_elnak_event.4.t:0 "Narai's Testament"
 khao_elnak_event.4.d:0 "Everything was supposed to go smoothly. The courts of Thirabnir were not easy to infiltrate, but where money couldn’t crack the gaps, natural abilities of our spies made its way through. The poison was served unnoticed to the Lord's table at his usual dinner time. It took time for the effects to come up, but soon the news arrived. Narai Chaiya was dead and it was time to elect a new Lord recommended in his suddenly materialised will. Or so we thought, as Thirabnir elected a local instead of [Y62.Monarch.GetName]!"
 khao_elnak_event.4.a:0 "How could they not get the memo?"
