 monstrous.1.t:0 "Middle of the Road"
 monstrous.1.d:0 "The [Root.Country.GetAdjective] people have made great advances in Demonsterizing, and have managed to validate ourselves in the eyes of the greater world. Nations will now think twice before dismissing us as mindless monsters whose only fate is to be driven out and killed. We have proven ourselves as a fledgling state eager to show their their mettle through proper, civil, means!"

 monstrous.2.t:0 "[Root.GetName]: Equal Amongst Men"
 monstrous.2.d:0 "Long has been our journey, but finally, we have proven to all those who have doubted us that we are true and respectable members of the civilized and international community... whether they like it or not!\n\nLong are the days of [Root.GetAdjective] people were slaughtered by bands of greedy adventurers, no, now we are the quest givers!"

 monstrous.3.t:0 "Of Monsters and War"
 monstrous.3.d:0 "Our monstrous nature has allowed our people to be ferocious and savage in combat. For aeons our dominions have been a monstrous frontier, unwelcome to most and dangerous to all. We do not subscribe to the civilities of warfare. Our people have fought for their land. Our people have fought to win. Our people have fought to survive.\n\nBut the reformists in our ranks say that we must hold ourselves to a standard greater than our own, that we must fight on the same playing field as our more civilized neighbours. Take prisoners, not slaves. Show mercy to respectable foes... keep our savagery in check."
 monstrous.3.a:0 "We must fight with dignity!"

 monstrous.4.t:0 "Monstrous Borders"
 monstrous.4.d:0 "Borders and the notion of nation states do not bother monsters. We live free with the land, and the land we own is the land we stand on. The nearby province of [province.GetName] has long suffered frequent incursions by our kind, and by monstrous rights we are able to claim it... but the reformists amongst us say that we should start respecting borders set by others."

 monstrous.5.t:0 "Monstrous Diplomacy"
 monstrous.5.d:0 "Since our decision to Demonsterize we have been sending envoys to nearby lands to meet and speak with any and anyone rather than fight and kill like the old days.

We are used to the rule by strength. The strong rules. The strong keeps what they earn.\n\nBut apparently the greater world prefers war with just causes, and this ridiculous thing called a 'Casus Belli'! Perhaps learning more about the ways of warfare will teach us a thing or two about conducting ourselves in military affairs."

 monstrous.7.t:0 "Newfound Decorum?"
 monstrous.7.d:0 "Our efforts to Demonsterize and show ourselves worthy in partaking in the wider community as equals has led to our people learning more about how to hold oneself in conversation. Where it be etiquette, to things like bowing or how to eat - and even things like learning their language and offering cultural exchanges.\n\nIf we wish to continue down this path, we could fund and exemplify our efforts in this matter - and it will surely have an effect to the world at large!"

 monstrous.12.t:0 "Famous Adventuring Band Captured!"
 monstrous.12.d:0 "Adventurers are a common sight prowling across our borders, hoping to fulfill some idiotic quest one way or another. We have recently captured a famous group of adventurers that seem to have been causing chaos in our realm for quite some time.\n\nIn the old times, there would be a simple solution: kill. But perhaps showing we can be merciful even to those who have wronged us greatly can improve our standing."
 monstrous.12.a:0 "Release them, and let them tell tales of our mercy."
 monstrous.12.b:0 "Kill them. Do it! Do it now!"
 
 monstrous.13.t:0 "Building in a New Style"
 monstrous.13.d:0 "Our recent construction in [province.GetName] has reached criticism amongst reformers in our ranks. They suggest that we take greater time and incorporate foreign elements in our architecture, and perhaps try new building styles. If not to learn for ourselves, but prove to the world that we are capable of doing something their way."
 monstrous.13.a:0 "It will set us back, but its worth it."
 monstrous.13.b:0 "What? Who cares!"
 
 monstrous.14.t:0 "New Model Army"
 monstrous.14.d:0 "The nations of the greater world have commonly fought in a different way to monsters like us. Perhaps we have different conducts of war, or perhaps we simply fight in a way they deem backwards.\n\nMilitary reformers who have been studying their ways have suggested that if we are to compete in the grand games played by the international community."
 monstrous.14.a:0 "We must learn their ways of war."
 monstrous.14.b:0 "We fight the way we have always fought."
 
 monstrous.15.t:0 "Language Lessons"
 monstrous.15.d:0 "The monstrous tongue is varied and for the rest of the world, extremely complicated, if not threatening or alien in some nature.\n\nAs such, one of the most important steps in reaching acceptance is to learn their ways, and the best way to do that is to learn their language. Our biology may not support it, and we may sound stupid in even attempting to speak their tongue properly and eloquently, but it matters. This will take a long period of time, but we must keep trying to understand and speak their language."
 monstrous.15.a:0 "Organize lessons for us all!"

 monstrous.18.t:0 "Foreign Investors in [province.GetName]"
 monstrous.18.d:0 "With our middling nature between pure monstrosity and being equal to the rest of the world, many from afar have come to our land seeking to invest in our fledgling nation. They see our lands as something to be nurtured, and hopes that if they get in early and support us that when we are welcomed by the rest of the world, that they will get their dividends."

 monstrous.19.d:0 "A well-respected individual from [province.GetName] in [country.GetName] has offered their services to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

 monstrous.19.b:0 "Begone!"
 
 monstrous.20.t:0 "Reformists Exploit Loophole"
 monstrous.20.d:0 "As we continue our progress in Demonsterization we have built a more bureaucratic and clerical caste that will help govern and reform our country. A small cabal within this group has apparently been caught exploiting a loophole of their own design to siphon off funds for their own benefit.\n\nWhen confronted they feign innocence, after all, this is how governments are supposed to work, right?"
 monstrous.20.a:0 "Uh, I guess its not illegal..."
 monstrous.20.b:0 "I see through your trickery!"
 
 monstrous.21.t:0 "State Debts?"
 monstrous.21.d:0 "With acceptance into the greater world we must learn to trade and take part in the greater financial institutions of the time such as banks and businesses.

 monstrous.22.t:0 "[country.Religion.GetName] Conversion"
 monstrous.22.d:0 "A prominent member of [country.GetName] has been spending time with [Root.Monarch.GetName] recently, and have made great efforts in advising the country in Demonsterizing. Within these talks have been topics on the matter of faith, and how converting to the [country.Religion.GetName] can help greatly in legitimizing [Root.Country.GetName] in the eyes of the world."
 monstrous.22.a:0 "I convert!"

 monstrous.24.db:0 "Our heir [Root.Heir.GetName] has returned to our realm a new person.\n\nThey had a great time learning and living out there, and have taken back a great many things to teach us on how to be accepted in the greater world."
 monstrous.24.dc:0 "Our heir [Root.Heir.GetName] has returned to our realm a new person.\n\nThey return almost foreign to our lands, speaking fluently in their tongue, and dressing in their clothes. While this might be a shock to some, they will have indeed learned a great many things in their time abroad."
 monstrous.24.a:0 "Welcome home!"
 
 monstrous.25.t:0 "Heroes Attack Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 monstrous.25.d:0 "Adventurers. Long have they been the bane of many a 'monstrous' nation, slipping behind our borders to strike at whatever target they deem prestigious enough. Now, they've committed an even more heinous offense against our people - attacking the very heart of our country; our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!\n\nWhilst we rested, a group of those fortune-seeking vagrants launched an assault against [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], catching us unaware. Though we quickly rose at the sound of the alarm, they had already engaged [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in battle! Even now, as we hasten to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side, we can hear the raging sounds of combat in the distance!"
 monstrous.25.a:0 "Hold on, [Root.Monarch.GetName]! We will not let you die!"
 
 monstrous.26.t:0 "Too High a Cost"
 monstrous.26.d:0 "Gaining respect in the eyes of the world is not easy, and we do not have the resources for it. Despite our best efforts we have not been able to teach the world of our peaceful ways."
