  # Mission titles and description
 covenblad_excavating_the_stone_city_title:0 "Excavating the Stone City"
 covenblad_excavating_the_stone_city_desc:0 "Castonath is a city built by Balgar, a stone city that was the greatest in all of Cannor prior to the Greentide. The Silver Reliquary has an interest in the city as a result, but it wishes to base itself outside of the city to avoid being too entangled in its civic administration. Silverdocks has a history that connects it to the city, however stands at a prime position to serve as sentinel over the lake, and so it is here that the chapter has decided to plant itself."
 covenblad_consolidating_the_west_title:0 "Consolidating the West"
 covenblad_consolidating_the_west_desc:0 "We have expanded far, into the swamps surrounding the old fortress that watched over the Alenic peoples in Bal Mire. From one ancient citadel to another, we can look here to project our power over Western Escann, even as the marshes make it a drudgery to campaign in. Yet some called even this place home and seek to return to Escann now that all has calmed down, and this matter deserves our attention. Let us ensure we have brought about order in these provinces for when they do so."
 covenblad_building_up_our_nation_title:0 "Building Up Our Nation"
 covenblad_building_up_our_nation_desc:0 "Our control over Escann has expanded, and with it has come the need to ensure that our realm is prosperous. Local economies disrupted over the past decades of turmoil must be rebuilt and trade links between nascent settlements stablised. While our control exists on paper, we must do what we can to build up a new society that binds across our land. The people will heed our words."
 covenblad_wyrmlings_roar_title:0 "Wyrmling's Roar"
 covenblad_wyrmlings_roar_desc:0 "Teagansfield marks the border between the Frontier and the Vale. Its people have their own history of heroism, the Young Dragon have marked our Northern Frontier with their stronghold of Bal Mire and they have their eyes on taking up a southern bastion too with these provinces. Formerly part of the Empire, these lands are the ultimate expression of the Dragon’s arrogance in their desire to take them to show our strength eclipses Anbennar’s."
 covenblad_above_mired_darkness_title:0 "Above Mired Darkness"
 covenblad_above_mired_darkness_desc:0 "All across Escann the Young Dragon wins hearts with their generosity, with many eager to forget the blood spilled to win the glory and gold that funds their ventures. They give many people hope and their vainglory attracts many an eager recruit. Where the swamps and marshes around Bal Mire lack in fertility, they make fertile ground for adventurers to prove themselves.. The Young Dragon chapterhouse provides a second home and a sworn fraternity to join for those otherwise lost."
 covenblad_soaring_unto_the_clouds_title:0 "Soaring Unto the Clouds"
 covenblad_soaring_unto_the_clouds_desc:0 "Prosperity comes, in the wake of the revelation of what the Black Tree has done, the Young Dragon chapter has swept into where it can to oppose the tyranny from within. They’ve pledged to bring all the glory to the lands unscathed and to do all they can to officially contest the Black Tree; to take up the case against them at the North Citadel and to censure the Black Tree chapter with help from the central government. Bal Mire is to be fortified to ensure they have a bastion to act from in this time of heightened internal tensions."
 covenblad_to_the_lake_title:0 "To the Lake"
 covenblad_to_the_lake_desc:0 "Lake Silvermere dominates the middle of Escann, and to be able to use it with our own lake craft would be vital in projecting our security further and bringing the peace of our rule to the lands that border it. Much of this land lies in the shadow of the White Walls, those around the Castannorian core and Castonath itself. It is a land that has witnessed much and shall witness more before our peace is ensconced."
 covenblad_the_silver_reliquary_title:0 "The Silver Reliquary"
 covenblad_the_silver_reliquary_desc:0 "The Silver Reliquary is an order of martial archivists, those knights dedicated to preserving knowledge both of how to fight, and that of studying more generally. This chapter was rooted in the inner circle of Alvar of Valefort during his time among the Aldresians. The imperatives he taught to his apprentices were twofold; that to fight for a future required the knowledge of what came before, and how fragile repositories of said knowledge could be during the fighting.The Greentide was an obvious call as a result, and those knights under Alvar’s tutelage have been invited to be invested and given official integration as to their expertise."
 covenblad_the_young_dragon_title:0 "The Young Dragon"
 covenblad_the_young_dragon_desc:0 "The Young Dragon is the name for a chapter within the Sword Covenant, mainly comprised of knights from the Alenic Reach and the Vernmen among the Aldresians. They typically come with an impetuousness that many have lost in the years since the Greentide and Corinsfall. Triandal sil Stringport was the one who led this organisation out of the Orda Aldresia, his brashness proving an inspiration as he went from battle to battle and has survived and stayed in his role as leader up until now. He chooses to settle the old fortress of Bal Mire and hopes to rebuild it to keep watch over the Alenics of old and the new threats of the North."
 covenblad_weaving_history_title:0 "Weaving History"
 covenblad_weaving_history_desc:0 "History exists to be made, this is the way of youth and so it is with our Young Dragons. Having succeeded in their goal of expanding our realm in the West and rebuilding this old fortress, it is time to formally invest the Young Dragon chapter into our government. The spirit of youth will be carried within ourselves, with luck their rashness shall be tempered in time, and we shall keep their spirit across ourselves as a whole. Only time will tell…"
 covenblad_the_elven_heritage_title:0 "The Elven Heritage"
 covenblad_the_elven_heritage_desc:0 "Diranbe is an art first practised by Elves who brought over the Precusor art of Bladedancing on their ships. During the time before the Landing, it was practised as a kind of martial cult across many of the ships, but especially notably on the Lunatein, the Moonfire. This was a secret society of sorts and distrusted by groups like the Silver Band, but their actions kept this ancient art alive so that its adherents could use it to this day and keep the torch of tradition alive."
 covenblad_the_roots_expanded_title:0 "The Roots Expanded"
 covenblad_the_roots_expanded_desc:0 "The curses that grip the Forlorn Vale are many, many coming from the time of Great Cardest and the ruin that came with its destruction by the Black Castanorians. The Black Tree chapter has devised a ritual though to forever alter it once more. A new curse, this time one that will affect all who have squatted or returned to the old kingdom. But the Black Tree does this in secret to ensure that those more scrupulous chapters are presented with a fait accompli when all is finally revealed."
 covenblad_breaking_the_limits_of_old_title:0 "Breaking the Limits of Old"
 covenblad_breaking_the_limits_of_old_desc:0 "The curse weaving continues as the boon for the Black Tree liege lords nears its completion. The denizens of the land once covered by Cardest and Farranean both shall be forced to obey their rightful lords. The Black Tree’s dominion in this enclave away from Hagstow will be complete, for such dark magicks might once have been out of our grasp, but for now the Black Tree will bring them to bear in the guise of what the rest of Covenblad knows only as a great blessing for safeguarding control."
 covenblad_fruits_of_the_vine_title:0 "Fruits of the Vine"
 covenblad_fruits_of_the_vine_desc:0 "Magic hath many rewards and the cup runs over in these times for the Black Tree, having the initiative to act and ensure our will is known across Covenblad. The Sword Covenant is riven and it is time for the fruits of our efforts to be borne out. We shall move to act against the impudent Young Dragon and we shall do this with a network of towers from which our spells can be wrought against the enemies of Covenblad and the Black Tree chapter both. "
 covenblad_a_promise_to_be_fulfilled_title:0 "A Promise to be Fulfilled"
 covenblad_a_promise_to_be_fulfilled_desc:0 "The Sword Covenant promised that ‘In Aldresia’s Name, By Spell and By Blade, Escann Shall Be Reclaimed’ when Galinda lead us out of an Orda Aldresia that had meekly chosen not to defend the people of Escann suffering from the Greentide. Our new nation will keep this promise, and to that end, we must act if that promise is to be kept. The Orda failed the Escanni people and we will correct that mistake."
 covenblad_a_covenants_charge_title:0 "A Covenant's Charge"
 covenblad_a_covenants_charge_desc:0 "The Chapter of the Burning Sword is the central chapter of the Sword Covenant, the one headed directly by Galinda herself when she led the exodus from the Orda Aldresia in 1424. They march as the proud vanguard of our military forces, acting as the archetypal example when a Covenbladic knight is imagined. They shall be the first of the chapters to be given official remit to act as a result of this."
 covenblad__reclaiming_an_old_seat_title:0 "Reclaiming An Old Seat"
 covenblad__reclaiming_an_old_seat_desc:0 "The North Citadel is where we decided to start again from after Corinsfall, and it is now, to where we return. It is an ancient seat, vital to the old era of Black Castanor and a place from where power projection can be restored. Magic enjoys sympathy and so to bring like to like is sure to bolster our fortunes in the present. Provided we can develop it to be a worthy capital and lay down new foundations for modern structures on top of what once was, it shall be the bastion of Covenbladic rule!"
 covenblad_light_the_way_home_title:0 "Light the Way Home"
 covenblad_light_the_way_home_desc:0 "It has been a long distance we’ve trekked to make our way to this place; starting from Arca Aldresia, across the Elfrealm, over the Lake, and all the way to Trialmount. Yet when our success seems so evident it hardly seems fitting to not share this with the other practitioners of Diranbe back in the Vale. It is time to make our way home and to further restore order in Escann as we do so. Our mage-knights crackling with the radiance of their abjuration magic as we do so."
 covenblad_against_the_vale_title:0 "Against the Vale"
 covenblad_against_the_vale_desc:0 "The Forlorn Vale is a cursed place, kept undeveloped due to it being a former frontier with Ibevar and Farranean, with both of these realms having their own ways of dealing with the cursed nature of the ground itself and the remnant magic of Great Cardest. We are so close to our old home and so we need to decide how best to proceed with the forces we have gathered to unite the old and new Escanni."
 covenblad_return_to_both_homes_title:0 "Return to Both Homes"
 covenblad_return_to_both_homes_desc:0 "Farranean is ours, the land of the old realm where human, elf and half-elf lived in harmony has been fully reclaimed. Many of our first generation of adventurers and immigrants had their origins here and so the question becomes of what we should do with those who have come to inhabit this land in our place. What we do with regards to them will reflect upon our values and what kind of new Escann we will have made with our spells and our blade."
 covenblad_a_declaration_of_intent_title:0 "A Declaration of Intent"
 covenblad_a_declaration_of_intent_desc:0 "With Rotwall and Ibevar under our control, the origin points of the martial Diranbe arts are under our control. Our magical prowess in this field is a great part of our success. With so much of Escann under our sway and with this chance we’ve had to return to our roots, the question is obvious of what comes next? What is the intent of our leaders and shall we say about how far we’ve come?"
 covenblad_the_sword_held_aloft_title:0 "The Sword Held Aloft"
 covenblad_the_sword_held_aloft_desc:0 "The chapter of the Burning Sword has kept us safe and warm with their efforts and so it is that this sword is now to be raised and the Covenbladic sceptre expanded further afield so that peace and justice can be found further and further afield from our humble beginnings, whether you start in the Orda, with the Covenant or with our new Kingdom. Let all around us take note and let us set an example we learn from ourselves as our blades loom large in the people’s imagination."
 covenblad_the_next_chapters_title:0 "The Next Chapters"
 covenblad_the_next_chapters_desc:0 "Our return has been secured, we have been welcomed home and the old fortresses are open to our knights once more, as they were for our forebears. The Orda has been swept aside and all that remains is to prove our superiority once and for all by finishing the Aldresian Crusade. To show that it was only the old ways, that kept us from saving innocents and doing what we know is right, that held us back before. We were deceived once but that shroud will hang over us no longer."
 covenblad_a_covenant_unmourned_title:0 "A Covenant Unmourned"
 covenblad_a_covenant_unmourned_desc:0 "The Old Sword Covenant seems to be no more. Where once the promise and the ideals of restoring Escann, of doing so in the truest spirit of the Aldresian Crusade and by doing it with our valour and magic in tandem seemed so possible, it seems reality has intervened. Our chapters seem riven with many embarking on projects that distract the Covenbladic government and spill the blood of its people, that endanger them for their own vanity. We are divided and it seems only a matter of time before rivalries flare up to destroy each other. Promise falters."
 covenblad_magic_ruling_man_title:0 "Magic Ruling Man"
 covenblad_magic_ruling_man_desc:0 "Magic; its abuse is what ruined Escann once before with the final end of Castanor, and its use was Escann’s salvation when Galinda sil na Ean led our sworn fraternity out of the decaying and corrupt Orda Aldresia. She claimed that magic would save Escann again and we have made it so. But it has been a long road for us since those days. Has our purpose wavered? In the name of the power to save lives, has our idealism faltered? What choices did we make in the name of all that we held dear?"
 covenblad_into_the_mountains_title:0 "Into the Mountains"
 covenblad_into_the_mountains_desc:0 "Out of the mountains the orcs came and swarmed, and so the mountains and entrances of the Serpentspine we must secure. These exits were the doom of so much of Escann and so we must establish ourselves in these territories to prevent further hordes coming out of these dark places to destroy our attempts at a new peace and new Escann."
 covenblad_the_broken_chain_title:0 "The Broken Chain"
 covenblad_the_broken_chain_desc:0 "Marlen of Moonmount had desired to always be prepared against the unknown and so had compiled codices of what could be done to guard against unexpected threats over the past few centuries. Still a middle aged elf, he marched out of the order alongside Galinda with the intent to learn all he could, first hand from Orcs and Goblins themselves if he could find ways for enemies to explain how best to fight their kind. This chapter is definitely an experiment in if we can trust those Greenskins who profess a desire to be knights, but we shall see what integration does for our understanding of how to fight their more savage compatriots."
 covenblad_the_black_tree_title:0 "The Black Tree"
 covenblad_the_black_tree_desc:0 "The Black Tree chapter derives its name from the Scogtrin of old Farranean and of the lengths they would go to drive the Orcs and Goblins out of Escann to re-allow humanity to flourish here. Unlike the other chapters with predominant leadership from specific individuals, the Black Tree followed Laurens sil Place originally but diverged after the Battle of Rottenstep. Where he chose to wander, the Black Tree chose to follow the rest of the Sword Covenant. They’ve now chosen to base themselves in Hagstow, and already rumours swirl of pacts being made."
 covenblad_curse_shaping_101_title:0 "Curse-Shaping 101"
 covenblad_curse_shaping_101_desc:0 "The Black Tree have settled themselves into Hagstow, seeking to bring many of their own families here. While the rumours of dark pacts persist, having created a home away from home for many of our first generation is an achievement few others have been able to match. As with the others before now, it is time to integrate the Black Chapter more formally into our government  and allow them to have authority over exclaves from returning refugees as they have proven themselves capable of handling that task."
 covenblad_journey_to_the_east_title:0 "Journey to the East"
 covenblad_journey_to_the_east_desc:0 "The art of Diranbe was the result of synthesis of elven practice with Halessi traditions of martial arts, brought about during the captivity of a band of Moon Elves, the Princess Guard, who had been serving under Jaher during his conquest of the lands of the Xia. Eventually many would escape and return to Cannor, bringing this new form with them. It is time to launch a great expedition of some of our finest knights to travel to far Haless and see if there is anything we can learn from the place where this happened."
 covenblad_magic_shall_free_me_title:0 "Magic Shall Free Me"
 covenblad_magic_shall_free_me_desc:0 "The knowledge of those who came and invaded Escann is something that should not be forgotten. The Broken Chain’s antecedents were founded by knowledge seekers and those who had researched the threat they might have posed before the Greentide proper. Marlen had been interested in these peoples and his successors have seen their humanity, they stand now with us and we are inducting these former monsters into our ranks. They may only start as pages and squires but their proximity brings with it their secrets by integration all the same."
 covenblad_embracing_all_avenues_title:0 "Embracing All Avenues"
 covenblad_embracing_all_avenues_desc:0 "Magical research has long been shackled by the confines of morality, and just as we are learning from the Orcs’ methods, it is up to us to free ourselves from the shackles of organisations like the Magisterium that would keep us locked into a stricter mindset of the magical paths to power. The Greenskins may still need time to be truly civilised, but perhaps their betters can learn how to perfect their methods. All chains must be broken and it is time we let our neighbours know we will never turn back on this now."
 covenblad_not_so_secret_apprentices_title:0 "Not-So-Secret Apprentices"
 covenblad_not_so_secret_apprentices_desc:0 "We are learning much. Where orcs were once our mortal enemies, slaughtering us or being hunted like animals in turn, we now find each other conversing as equals in the halls of our courts. The Broken Chain has attached itself to the central government in hopes that this proximity will give them legal protection. The royal family has benefited much from this union and so it only remains to be seen if the call of long term relationships will outweigh the outward appearances of civility from the Silver Reliquary and the allure of material they bring."
 covenblad_a_symposium_for_shamanism_title:0 "A Symposium for Shamanism"
 covenblad_a_symposium_for_shamanism_desc:0 "The eponymous alloy, after which Steelhyl is named, is apparent in its abundance, and as a result has been smelted for centuries by those least fortunate who were forced to work in the caverns that dot the hills. Marlen has decided that the Broken Chain shall be based here, that in this place so close to the mountains that hordes came from, and where so many have toiled in the past, that learning of Covenblad’s enemies seems most apt, especially with a supply of iron to be put to use in their undertakings."
 covenblad_reinforcing_the_east_title:0 "Reinforcing the East"
 covenblad_reinforcing_the_east_desc:0 "The east of the White Walls have now been essentially brought under our control, and with it we can say that Inner Castanor is close to being the safest it has been since Castanor itself. Our control has brought a new prosperity, with troops that the old withered realm of Castellyr could never have drawn upon with its reliance on duels to keep the peace. Ours is a peace backed by spells and sword and such sinews have won us many provinces like these."
 covenblad_stamping_our_authority_title:0 "Stamping Our Authority"
 covenblad_stamping_our_authority_desc:0 "Escann fell due to the failures of the age of Chivalry. We may be a nation formed by recalcitrant mage knights but our honour is defined in the heart and deeds of saving people, not in the name of the thing that was such an obsession of the pre-Greentide nations. This message, that our ideals mean only as much as we can project them, will be safeguarded by building as many fortifications to protect our heartlands as we can. In Covenblad’s guise, Escann will be known once more."
 covenblad_the_relic_road_title:0 "The Relic Road"
 covenblad_the_relic_road_desc:0 "When the orcs erupted out of the Serprentspine, many dwarves took advantage of this to begin trying to reclaim their ancestral homes in the newly depopulated tunnels. Khugdhir fell just as the Greentide began, and so its attempted reclamation is synonymous to many Cannorians with ties to the Asra Bank to our own efforts here in Escann. The trade links between those dwarves remaining in Cannor and those who returned is something the Silver Reliquary hopes to use with their efforts renovating Castonath."
 covenblad_old_stone_old_power_title:0 "Old Stone, Old Power"
 covenblad_old_stone_old_power_desc:0 "Castonath, the city built by Balgar and inherited by men. The Silver Reliquary has long seen it as a place of great potential for heptagrammic magic, using its old foundations riddled with geomantic inscriptions to unleash great power. To do this will require much in the way of endurance from the people there, and the lack of ability to feel a good night’s sleep is surely not so bad when it means you work harder in the day whilst within the remit of this great magical undertaking?"
 covenblad_tearite_smelting_title:0 "Tearite Smelting"
 covenblad_tearite_smelting_desc:0 "The Silver Reliquary has been focusing its efforts on the knowledge of the past that was lost, obsessed with the knowledge of the dwarves, Balgar, and now the knowledge of Spellblades. While this knowledge cannot be restored, the Silver Reliquary has borne the fruit of being able to create more tearite than ever before for our tearite blades. They may not equal the mightiest artefacts, but their quantity brings a quality all of its own. These metallurgy techniques need workers, and the uppity greenskins will prove the best workers to survive the harsh conditions that will be meted out in service to weapons of exquisite make."

 flavour_covenblad.2.d:0 "Now that our nation is in a proper position, the place of the Sword Covenant itself must be maintained, for it is they, as mage-knights, to whom we owe so much. Even now, new apprentices and pages are being taken on from our new people. They shall have the honour of being the new Knights Errant for a new Escann. For just as our borders shall grow so shall their jurisdiction with it, and their word shall be above even that of any aristocracy.\n\nAlready, the leading lights of the Sword Covenant are gathering disciples they hope to organise into chapters, like in our Aldresian past. With a paramount knight who handles disputes and acts as the organisation's voice to be at the top; this Palatine-Arbiter will join our councils and governmental meetings and give voice to what they can continue to offer Covenblad.\n\nThe people look to our government and the Covenant both to deliver them from the dilapidated state of Escann, and it is a burden we will carry with dignity; to act in accordance with the values they expect us to hold."

 flavour_covenblad.3.d:0 "We have failed. Our decision to leave was based on a promise to the people of Escann and we have failed them. Faith that Covenblad is here to stay is dying and many are choosing to desert our armies or never make their presence due on levy registers when they should. This too will pass if our nation can still survive, but one broken promise often begets a trail of the same ilk."

 flavour_covenblad.4.d:0 "Good things can never last, this was the feeling that was felt throughout court today as the itinerant Laurens sil Place darkened our door. A master of enchantment magicks, he forced his way into the capital by charming any who dared to stop him and has now interrupted our council with a small cadre of those already enthralled or dedicated to opportunistically following his beck and call.\n\n“I have come for what is mine.” he calls. The years have not been kind to the knight of prodigious talent who left his Farrani peers to call for aid, only to find a kingdom already collapsed when he returned. His rivalry with Galinda and Reanna, themselves of the Farrani royal line, only exacerbated his disdain and desire to claim leadership over the Covenant.\n\nSo Laurens enters. “I should lead the Sword Covenant, if not the Kingdom itself.” he says simply, words dripping with venom even as he never raised his voice. He walks up directly to the council, our Arbiter and Sovereign, and looks between them all. Blood looks to be shed, whatever is decided by the notables in the room."

 flavour_covenblad.10.d:0 "Castellyr was the feudal successor to the Castanorian Empire, once the mightiest of the realms of Chivalric Escann. Yet it fell first when the Greentide poured into it, and in that fall many of the nobles fled and kept running til they reached the safety of the Empire of Anbennar. Many of those who went to fight assumed they might stay there with their wealth and live out new lives. It seems this is not to be.\n\n‘Escann shall be reclaimed’, this was the promise contained within the Sword Covenant when they left the Orda Aldresia to take up arms against the Greentide, but what does that mean? We thought it meant a full restoration, but the return of nobles who ask for their land back has many questioning this.\n\nThese people left their own to die and fled with all they had, but now seek their feudal rights restored and land restituted? It might be restoring Escann as it was in terms of their place, but everything else has already changed. Perhaps we should make our own will known and say that the past should be left to die."

 flavour_covenblad.11.d:0 "These were the first lands to be lost, both within Escann, in the case of Castellyr, and then again for being the first settlements in Castellyr to fall. The survivors of these lands have been away from home the longest, and now that they have returned, despite witnessing the old order in ruins, they still stubbornly hold onto the past. Some of these proud Escanni come to us, requesting old laws and privileges restored. They want autonomy to select their own mayors of towns and restore their ancestral keeps and manors.\n\nTo allow this would be tantamount to a parallel government alongside the local ordinances we had already established for these new provinces as we annexed them into our order. Escann’s restoration requires our success to continue, but is what is being asked by these refugees going to restore the lost? Many of these current returnees have organised themselves to commit to long term simmering resistance if rejected. Is it a useful expenditure of our time to force them to be the exact image of Covenbladic we create in the capital?"

 flavour_covenblad.20.d:0 "Even though the land that once belonged to the old realm of Bal Mire is of poor quality, its people are a hardy and proud lot, though often overlooked. Indeed many of our new settlers were greatly surprised by their mannerisms before they came to recognise the value of some of the lessons these Mirans taught.\n\nStill they come with their old festivals and customs, ones of their own designs from the time before the Greentide, that they have come to ask to be restored in exchange for all this expertise they have been lending our people in the region. For the most part, it is no great trouble for us to do so, but do these traditions fit our principles, on which we have been rebuilding Escann until now?\n\nThese swamps are easy to seal and so we could keep them here with their knowledge by force if we do not wish to oblige them ,and as poor as the land is, accepting their asks will make it harder for others to be defended thanks to lessened contributions from these Miran provinces.\n\nWhat should we do?"

 flavour_covenblad.21.d:0 "These were the lands of the Count’s League once, the last remnants of the feudal nobility of Castellyr that cared to stay and fight, who had been paralysed with indecision until Corin came and turned the tide as she did everywhere. It had been one of the last lines for the Escanni and its time has come to an end here. No longer will those heroes hold sway for we have been required to stem the gap in control.\n\nYet still not all of those who fought have been defeated, many have petitioned our local representatives for autonomy and their own internal governance for a time with deliberate ordinances for their rights in exchange for lending their full support in troops and the expertise they had in fighting the Greentide across the whole long since 1424.\n\nFor us to have taken this land means they did not succeed entirely though, but they can still marshal some strength to oppose our control if we wish to be more heavy handed and fully correct the mistakes that lead to the end of their League.\n\nThis decision is not without ramifications, what kind of Covenblad shall we fashion with this decree?"

 flavour_covenblad.30.t:0 "Judging of Character"
 flavour_covenblad.30.d:0 "The lands of the Forlorn Vale hold a special place in the heart of many of the Covenbladic people. The native Escanni of Farraneán formed a much larger grouping of the surviving refugees and people of the realms of Chivalric Escann for one, and the Aldresians always were primarily comprised of Vernman and Farrani in equal measure, which prompted the great sympathy and the reasoning behind the Conclave of 1424.\n\nUntil now we have not had to resort to the traditional methods of recruitment, of cantonal towns and lottery for conscription, but with the slow dearth of new adventurers and immigrants to Escann, we are beginning to see the need arise to do something with the forces at our disposal.\n\nMany believe that we can outfit our troops better, to have them better trained and outfitted, but to do so will force us to spend more and take some of those who still volunteer and have them act as the farriers, smiths and foragers needed to keep up the spirits of our forces. But there are those who say it is time to become a normal country when it comes to recruiting.\n\nThere is no shame in having to do so and the legacy of our heroism will continue to inspire communal pride, but it is a moment of judgement to make. To save more lives with fewer people fighting or to integrate all walks of life into the forces of the kingdom, which is the value closest to which we aspire?"

But there are those who are living here now, those who had made this their home before we came here?\n\nWhat shall become of them? Are we to remove them all, to send them backing as the refugees of the first Farraneán did? Or shall we show them the value of being Farrani and let our settlers return slowly to what had been their old homes and live in harmony?"

 flavour_covenblad.32.t:0 "Covenbladic Diranbe"
 flavour_covenblad.32.d:0 "Diranbe is an ancient art and it is an art we now control all the sources of. In an extraordinary step, the monarch and Palatine-Arbiter both, along with the other notables from across the Covenbladic Realm, have come for a triple series of lectures: In the ruins of Escin, where the old Scogtrin lay; In the halls of Blaidscall, where now all students learn of the arts of Diranbe from the best; And from atop the battlements of Rotwall and with voices booming out the crenelations.\n\nThese speeches are said to be on the topic of the vision of what Diranbe can now be with all the forces at our disposal. We look to the glories of the past to inspire our present, to uncover all the truths we can and to make clear to Halann what our might is capable of. Where once Ibevari and Aldresian Diranbe stood at odds, now these are only two of the schools within the whole of the singular Covenbladic Diranbe curriculum.\n\nThe speaker begins to start the tour in Escin, the Palatine-Arbiter’s words setting the example for the tone of the rest of the engagements and this grand show of a royal progress both."
 flavour_covenblad.32.a:0 "The speech is about our glory, of all the things we are yet to do."

 flavour_covenblad.40.t:0 "Amongst the City-Ships"
 flavour_covenblad.40.d:0 "The City-Ships of Anbenncost are a dizzying sight for many of our knights, few used to the city of the world’s desire in all its grandeur and its metropolitan nature. To see so many from different walks of life makes our operatives try all the harder to seem normal, cloaks stowed and faces open for the diplomatic tact these steps will require.\n\nEnquiries are made with local community leaders of those who live on the ships still, and permission is sought and gained for our knights to inspect those parts of the ships where any secrets might have been left behind.\n\nWe don’t seek much, but given the people who left in a hurry and the much more practical concerns of those who continued to stay here, it would not be so unheard of to make a miraculous find.\n\nAlas it is not to be and all we could find was an old compartment with an artefact that seems to be a relic of some kind, a smooth stone inset into a pyramid of metal. There is something about its reflection though that sticks in the mind as we begin to prepare to try the remnants of the Whitespear instead."
 flavour_covenblad.40.a:0 "We shall give this to a local authorities for safe keeping and as a token of our thanks."
 flavour_covenblad.40.b:0 "Perhaps it is worth something, sell it to fund our expenses."
 flavour_covenblad.41.t:0 "The Weathered Diary"
 flavour_covenblad.41.d:0 "Celmaldor, the city built in a similar way to Anbenncost but with Maldorian’s Galsheáh. It is much less intact than those city ships in Dameria but this also provides a chance for us to see what can be found amidst those foundations.\n\nThe reach is freezing, far from a mere nip in the air for most of our company who are not used to such chills. The howls of the wolves and the surrounding wilderness fare us little better and we are all glad to reach the safety of the city when we do.\n\nWe are in luck though as we come upon a strange antique shop selling what is best described as Maldorian themed kitsch to travellers who come to see the strange city of frozen over elves. One item though is found to potentially be real, and remarkably, it is one of the cheapest items.\n\nHaggling is done after the shopkeeper notices our interest and we find ourselves in possession of a manual of battle from one of the members of the martial cult of bladedancing who must have lived on the Galsheáh. It is only with some weariness that someone points out that one of the items used for reflection to enter the bladedancing paradigm seems far too similar to what we found in Anbenncost."
 flavour_covenblad.41.a:0 "But we have found an old diary that could be everything. Let a chartered ship be found."
 flavour_covenblad.42.t:0 "A Perfect Match"
 flavour_covenblad.42.d:0 "Returning to Anbenncost we retrace our steps and find where we had given over the item known as the Reflexive Point and politely ask for it back, able to re-secure it into our possession. Together with the diary, these points provide a perfect match to begin to rediscover the paradigm of Bladedancing that the elves were working from.\n\nThe movements have a fluidity to them, that even with modern innovations it was felt to all who attempted to walk this reversionary path. The stillness of the rooms giving way to imperceptible sways and a clear control of one’s own movements that allows for deadly technique and the grasp of somatic components for magic that make this deadly combination.\n\nIt’ll take a while for this to fully filter through and be taught to instructors who can teach other instructors, but even without any technical innovations with all that we have learned since the Landing, to have this ability to reconstruct prior forms of magic allows us to better teach and understand how we can improve ourselves. A solid starting point makes all the difference."
 flavour_covenblad.42.a:0 "Let all remember what was trodden before us."
 flavour_covenblad.43.t:0 "First Port of Call"
 flavour_covenblad.43.d:0 "Bulwar is one of many regions that claims to be the birthplace of humanity, naturally this is not exactly a respected viewpoint among our knights as they make their way via the chosen port and begin to cross the Suran plain. The reaction of many of the locals hardly makes this a pleasant stay compared to the much warmer receptions the party in Western Cannor must be receiving, but they make do.\n\nGifts to the local temples are given to speed themselves on the way without trouble, and horses aplenty seen to and provided by enthusiastic salespeople who speak of the pedigree of the fine breed of steed that carries the Covenbladic adventurers further afield and into the lands of the Masnih people.\n\nAfter a particularly foolhardy knight's suggestion of seeing the Sand Demon is roundly rejected by the others, the journey still remains difficult. The route of the Golden Highway provides somewhat of an avenue for a path to take, but even then there is always trouble afoot, with more supersitious caravanserai rejecting the presence of outsiders forcing us to spend our nights gazing at the stars by happenstance, and not by choice."

 flavour_covenblad.44.d:0 "Rahen is hot, we all knew it would be so, but to be sweltering as we are and unadjusted to the heat, it can still be felt. That and all the bureaucracy that must be waded through as we make our way through this very different land to Bulwar is palpable; The linguist among our group doing all she can to learn how to get us through as she interacts with these Harimari who we had previously only heard tall tales of.\n\nThese tiger-people and the humans they rule over and with, have such a similar way to how the feudal realms of Cannor work and yet are so different in others. They even ride great tusked and dangerous beasts with large ears that seem to be a shield of sorts to protect their multiple riders. Many of the horses we brought with us were startled, even with them being more familiar than ourselves as riders to these circumstances.\n\nOur path is easy though, following one of the great rivers of this land up to the place known as the Xia, where Jaher’s invasion was the site of the capture of the elves that led to the unlikely cultural ties between prisoner and jailor in the old monastery of the Jianxusi. Past the criminal city of Sarisung and up to this battleground region our knights ride and do their best to stay undetected."

 flavour_covenblad.45.d:0 "The monastery is gone, the old mountain temple where the elves had been kept prisoner; Its stone repurposed and any wood left worn down by seasons of snow and rain. All that is left is the faint outline of where certain growth is shallower or where crevices in rock run deeper. The Jianxusi monastery lies elsewhere now, rebuilt after the fall of Jaher’s Empire here in the East.\n\nBut despite that, it has a potent magical energy. It brims with grim tidings of a bloody past, of betrayals and festering hatred against one's wardens.\n\nIt is a place where it feels like it could always be pouring with rain.\n\nWhere the nights always have the serenity of a full moon.\n\nWhere ghosts walk in strange solace.\n\nIt is the place where Diranbe began.\n\nWhere it first drew blood.\n\nWhere the font of knowledge can open once more."

 flavour_covenblad.46.t:0 "Status of the Covenant"
 flavour_covenblad.46.d:0 "The Covenant is not just a name, it reflects the promise and the binding agreement that kept our blades together in dark times and through the tribulations that came with the call to arms against the might of the Greentide. In this post-Greentide world though, what this promise has come to mean is something that has divulged across our nation with the challenges to the ideals we aspired to.\n\nA captain looks to his men to see what honour means to them as he prepares to exhort them of the need to take action now against an eldritch cult; the lone archivist who wanders into the forbidden sections of old libraries in search of knowledge she knows has the power to save people; the knight errant who has journeyed long and seen where ideals led others as he begins to cavort his own power and focus on himself alone.\n\nThey all swear that they hold true to the promise that a mage-knight exists to serve others, but they all see this promise in a different light. But which of these attitudes holds the most sway in Covenblad and what its people expect when they hear of the Sword Covenant and the Covenbladic government's involvement in situations?"

The latter simply smiling darkly.\n\nThen the representative of the Burning Sword tried to call them all down and the Palatine Arbiter echoed these thoughts but it was for nihl. All four of these chapters have come to blows over minor grievances before and now they all declared in a final act of unity that they could not all be satisfied. The representatives then all left, each taking care not to be seen leaving together and especially not with who they argued. To Hagstow, to Steelhyl, to Bal Mire and Silverdocks they all absconded.\n\nThe promise of the Covenant that keeps Covenblad united even in darkest times is rent asunder."

The great fires of magic burning high as the last of the Chaptermasters of the Dragon rides out to meet his doom and rue the inactions of the government that allowed the Black Tree to be so brazen before and in this moment.\n\nEven if any members of the Young Dragon chapter did survive, they would find that so total was the defeat of the bulk of their fraternity, that the government simply records that they dissolved themselves.

With the spell wringing that the Silver Reliquary had embarked upon and in the name of putting a stop to such recklessness once and for all, the members of the Broken Chain are being given this chance to prove themselves once and for all with the arrest of this rogue element.\n\nIt would be a typical sight, the knights riding to Silverdocks to promulgate this order, if not for the amount of green skin under all these suits of armour. Orcs, Half-Orcs and Goblins alongside residual human members all riding in strict wedges as the very epitome of Covenbladic order and discipline.\n\nWhere once they had been outcast and turned into servants after the conquest of their tribes in the wake of Corinsfall and the end of the Greentide, now these individuals stand as knights first and foremost as they went to arrest their corrupted peers.\n\nNone truly expected the Reliquary to accept this state of affairs, many of them were likely to perish in this putting down of the wayward archivists and scholars, but they all went together and as one."

The city still stood there but nothing else seemed to remain and those scouts dare not intrude upon the chambers of the smelters and forges that had been set up for the new production of tearite weaponry."

Whether that sets you apart to lord over those weaker, to become a paragon, to inspire them to be better, or to simply have the ability to walk your own path in a world full of obligations.\n\nMagic always exists in the present, even spells long ago cast are felt here and now and not merely as old war wounds. For as long as its effects are felt, you can say that magic remains alive, that the caster lives on in this twisted and warped war.\n\nSo too is it for the prosperity that magic brings, the sinews of its arcana that Covenblad has brought about for its people as we stand at the forefront of all Escann. We know now how the Orda Aldresia and the shackles of morality kept us in chains and prevented us from truly grasping at the strength and conviction needed to become a greater monster than those threatening us all."

 flavour_covenblad.70.d:0 "It started simply enough, with one of our knights choosing to risk civilians in the name of a greater monster threat. He was admonished to a great extent though by his knight captain and this radicalised his fellow knights. The desire for radical steps in the name of greater peace has thus seeped into many of the chapters and local keeps. The challenges of the new Escann require sacrifices to maintain its security, but are those the steps we take or our ideals themselves?"

 flavour_covenblad.71.d:0 "The previous incidents of knights seeing collateral damage as acceptable have increased even more and this attitude seems to be the majority one amongst the modern Covenant. Worse still, the baleful cries of the deceased and their final words of vengeance and bitter cries for aid when slain by monsters, bandit or soldiers alike too often leave undead in their wake. There have even been whispers of isolated incidents of knights accused of utilitarian necromancy, commanding these abominations against rampaging orcs, satyrs and the other dangers that still lurk in the dark corners of Escann."

Today a dwarf member of the Covenant declared a grudge against the new guard and left in disgrace, disgusted at the new methods we have embraced in the name of the greater good. That is the watch-word many still cling too even as it seems scornful itself. When power comes so naturally to those who wield it in the name of saving the weak, why should anyone accept their scorn when their fickle praise is all that matters?"

This promise is well and truly shattered, for could it have ever meant anything? Power resides in the will of the righteous, in those who go forth and shape the world with their own strength. Did Galinda really care for the people, or for her own legacy? History is written in deeds and not the ink of promises kept or broken. Covenblad is a strong nation and it was the strength of our forebears, not their ideals or promises that are what the modern mage-knight draws inspiration from."

 flavour_covenblad.80.d:0 "The Sword Covenant has a unique pride of place among many former adventuring companies, as this band of knights has been able to keep itself self-sustaining. The chief representative of the Covenant is the Palatine-Arbiter. So named for their official and princely authority, they arbitrate the disputes between our chapters and are selected from among worthy candidates from the five chapters.\n\nThese chapters retain their own heads. The Palatine-Arbiter’s chief responsibility is service to the Covenbladic Monarchy and to serve as the chief contact point between this modern nation being moulded, and the knightly order that serves it directly and indirectly through its penetration of much of the organs of control.\n\nWhether upon the accession of a new monarch as is customary to keep the order and nation both from being stale, or with the death of the previous Arbiter, the time has come for the monarch and the chaptermasters to come together and select who is worthy to take up the mantle of the Palatine-Arbiter, once more."
