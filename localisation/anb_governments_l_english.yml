In time this led to the rise of powerful merchants becoming nobles, and later those nobles mixing with the royal houses. These merchant nobles used their power to enforce a pseudo-elective monarchy in the Raghamidesh lands, where each of the represented houses could put forward a candidate for election. The elective was open only to houses of royal descent, and was just as often won through promises of wealth as it was skill, making both critical components of such elections."
