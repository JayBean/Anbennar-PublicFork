Combining the traditions of their tribe to Kai customs, Chien Binhrung became a land where the queen's will was law and where the people were willing to fight for her against any foe. The tribe that formed Chien Binhrung also picked up the customs of their new Kai brethren, including a focus on open trade with neighbors and adopting the Righteous Path as their new faith."

Some in our ranks have begun to wonder if the Dookanson's war truly was for the benefit of orckind, and if it was, how could Dookan himself abandon us and his champion? Even our shamans begin to doubt the ancient ways, and some wonder if instead of relying on Dookan that we should rely on ourselves - and try to forge a new home in this strange land. After all, we orcs respect strength, as Dookan told us, and we were justly beaten on the field of battle by the humans... so maybe there's a thing or two we can learn from them?"

In this new land comes new opportunities, and we goblins are not so stubborn as our orcish cousins. If we must broker deals with the adventurers then we will do so, if we must say false platitudes to the orcish remnants, we will do so, but one thing is certain: with Korgus Dookanson dead and the Greentide defeated, we have managed to scrap our way to independence - and this time, it'll stay that way."

We have not only the manpower, but the equipment needed as well and it may prove to be a lucrative and stable business venture.

Thus, to prevent our nation being captured by a horde of enemies, we must use every piece of equipment or skill there is to bolster our defenses. Once such a way is to employ mages in creating extra shielding around our walls, creating a strong extra layer of protection around our points of interest.

This upbringing ingrains a discipline in them that has remained unmatched anywhere else and makes the hobgoblins of the Command perfect military instructors. We would be fools, then,  not to employ our own hobgoblin community in drilling our armies and making them more organized, disciplined and overall professional. The harsh training regiments of the hobgoblins will make our soldiers more sturdy, reliable and brave, though it will also mean fewer men get through bootcamp, as the weak will not be able to keep up with the high and unforgiving demands of their red drillmasters. Nonetheless, our armies shall be like iron, and march against our enemies with unrivaled discipline!"

Empires of elves, harimari or dwarves come and go, yet it is humans that always remain and return.

They dwell in large numbers and are rarely seen alone, forming tight-knit communities that rely on their numbers to compensate for their lack of individual strength. By employing these large communities as mass infantry, we can form substantial groups of "replenishable" soldiers who fire and fight in unison. However, this communal behavior could also damage their morale in case of high casualties."

When in water, lizardfolk can reach speeds and depths that make them evasive and nigh-undetectable. So why not employ them for exactly these purposes? By having lizardfolk perform swift and stealthy attacks during amphibious landings and deploying them to secure the first beachheads, can we ensure the success of our naval invasions and deploy our main force with little opposition. Another benefit we could eke is in  using lizardfolk to enter and sabotage enemy ships during naval combat and having them perform attacks behind enemy lines, boosting our morale and weakening that of an enemy forced continually to fear our surprise amphibious attacks."

The ogres, having naturally thick skins and possessing a strength we cannot even dream of matching, make for perfect shieldbearers. By having them carry immense and thick shields can we offer our men protection from enemy salvos or give our men a place to rest or get patched up by medics. While these mobile fortresses are a boon for our army, they will also cost us a massive amount of food and resources:  ogres eat tenfold what our regulars eat and we cannot deny them a single meal, lest they start snacking on some poor nearby infantrymen.

So why not employ this culture in our army and adopt the tenets of aggressiveness and overwhelming strength into our army as a whole?

Former Antler Knights make for the bravest chargers to shatter even the most disciplined ranks; cunning Epednari scouts can spot even the stealthiest hostiles; and the Taychendi with their war-chariots make perfect mobile fire positions to rain down havoc upon their opponents.
