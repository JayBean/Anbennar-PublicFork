Upon the death of our current ruler, a series of duels are held between the most notable of orcs in the kingdom, usually minor clan chiefs and famous generals.

In time this led to the rise of powerful merchants becoming nobles, and later those nobles mixing with the royal houses. These merchant nobles used their power to enforce a pseudo-elective monarchy in the Raghamidesh lands, where each of the represented houses could put forward a candidate for election. The elective was open only to houses of royal descent, and was just as often won through promises of wealth as it was skill, making both critical components of such elections."
