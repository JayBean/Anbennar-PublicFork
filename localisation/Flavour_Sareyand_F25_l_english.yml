 sareyand_0_patronage_of_the_landlords_desc:0 "Our lands are dotted with the massive estates of our Sun Elven brethren. It is those landlords that are the foundation of our rule and it is with their support that we can gain and maintain our greatness."
 sareyand_0_sunshine_manors_title:0 "Sunshine Manors"
 sareyand_0_sunshine_manors_desc:0 "The manors of the landlords are the motor of our economy. Their massive farm estates provide the taxes and the resources that maintain our politics, infrastructure and army. So naturally more developed estates mean more money."
 sareyand_0_rebuild_the_ash_palace_title:0 "Rebuild the Ash Palace"
 sareyand_0_rebuild_the_ash_palace_desc:0 "Since the palace of Sareyand was burned down during Jexis' youth its husk has sat there like a great carcass, black and empty. It is time we restore this relic of Jaher's days to its former glory, and possibly even embellish it further. That will show we truly are the worthy successors of the great conqueror."
 sareyand_0_the_bulwark_of_the_sun_title:0 "Bulwark of the Sun"
 sareyand_0_the_bulwark_of_the_sun_desc:0 "The Mountains of the Sun guard the western approach of Bulwar from the Salahad. The construction of a great fort there can be exactly the protection we need against new gnollish incursions and will safeguard our lands."

 sareyand_1_around_lake_naza_desc:0 "The Naza estates house some of the wealthiest landlords of our nation and some of the royal family's most avid supporters.

 sareyand_1_the_mountains_of_the_sun_desc:0 "The Mountains of the Sun have been infested with gnolls since time immemorial. It was the outpost of many gnoll raids during Jaher's time and still under his successors. Let us bring them under our rule and ensure that such a thing never happens again."

 sareyand_1_the_heart_of_bulwar_desc:0 "Bulwar is a land of city-states and a land of city-states is at its heart.

 sareyand_1_the_length_of_the_suran_title:0 "The Length of the Suran"
 sareyand_1_the_length_of_the_suran_desc:0 "The Suran is the lifeblood of Bulwar, it flows from beyond Azka-Sur to Sareyand, Bulwar and all the way down to Brasan. Obviously, its importance to region cannot be overstated. And so, we should control it, from the source all the way down to the lands where in mythical times the Djinn were first broken."

 sareyand_2_the_gate_of_the_east_desc:0 "Sareyand is the great eastern facing city of Bulwar and through its gates flows all the trade with Rahen. We should ensure that this trade is firmly in our grasp so that we force our will upon traders from the lands of the elephants and tigers."

 sareyand_2_trade_with_rahen_desc:0 "The trade with Rahen is one of the most lucrative sources of income since the days of old Castanor and the Damerian Republic.

 sareyand_3_restore_the_akalate_of_azka_sur_desc:0 "Azka-Sur was once one of the major Kingdoms of Bulwar, but under repeated onslaught from gnollish attacks it lost both its land and its sun elven rulership.

 sareyand_3_the_true_lords_of_bulwar_title:0 "True Lords of Bulwar"
 sareyand_3_the_true_lords_of_bulwar_desc:0 "Many peoples have disputed who are the lords of Bulwar. There have been human priests and kings, harpy matriarchs and gnollish warlords. But since the Landing it has been clear that elves are the true lords of this land and we will prove that time and again."
 sareyand_3_the_rogue_legion_title:0 "The Rogue Legion"
 sareyand_3_the_rogue_legion_desc:0 "Since their return from Haless the old phoenix legions have gone rogue and become an unbridled horde with no civilisation or structure. Now they even went astray in their faith. We must bring these warriors back to the right path so that they can be a support to the cause instead of a threat."
 sareyand_3_the_great_ash_legion_title:0 "The Great Ash Legion"
 sareyand_3_the_great_ash_legion_desc:0 "Too long have we relied on human auxiliaries and legionaries to fuel our war machine. They are good only for support. It is the elves that conquered Bulwar and Haless and so the Ash Legion must also be an elven legion at the core. We now finally have the numbers once more to make this vision a reality."
 sareyand_4_found_the_shining_monastery_title:0 "The Shining Monastery"
 sareyand_4_found_the_shining_monastery_desc:0 "The monks of the Blazing Sun have been a great support in our campaigns and in our administration.

 sareyand_4_ashes_to_iron_title:0 "Ashes to Iron"
 sareyand_4_ashes_to_iron_desc:0 "We have resumed the attack, but attacking on its own won't let us gain the heights of a Phoenix. We must harden our armies and beat them into shape. Our Ash Legion will be a blade of the strongest steel to cut down our enemies."
