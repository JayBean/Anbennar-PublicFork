 pelomar_reclaim_pelodard_title:0 "Reclaim Pelodard"
 pelomar_reclaim_pelodard_desc:0 "An embarrassment to our rule, control over our rightful realm of Pelodard has decayed over the centuries. Once a bastion of the Eordellon faith and the Oathsworn name, the traitors of Kairncal turned to worshipping the Spring a few centuries after the unfortunate defeat of the first Oathsworn. Our ancestors have failed to reintegrate them, it is up to us to restore our rightful rule over Kairncal and Pelodard!"
 pelomar_arakepruni_rivals_title:0 "Arakepruni Rivals"
 pelomar_arakepruni_rivals_desc:0 "Arakeprun has always been our enemy, taunting us for the defeat of Pelodan the First by their deceitful hands. Although they pride themselves as being the heralds of spring, the season of renewal, they do not hesitate to stoop to the past to mock our honour. It is time that their mockery is silenced."
 pelomar_elchosi_frontier_title:0 "Elchosi Frontier"
 pelomar_elchosi_frontier_desc:0 "The Dukad of Elchos lies between the most righteous Pelomar and the Arakepruni worms. Although in the past the Oathsworn aided the Elchosi in their fight for independence, let it not be misunderstood that they are not our allies. The Elchosi were an opportunity to hurt our hated rivals; they are also Vernal iconoclasts who have turned away from the teachings of the Fey. Their lands should also prove as a prime border and frontline for our continued efforts against the Selpheregi heretics."
 pelomar_end_the_selphereg_apostasy_title:0 "The Selphereg Apostasy"
 pelomar_end_the_selphereg_apostasy_desc:0 "With Elchos and the greater Monkast area under the control of the Oathsworn, Arakeprun itself lies within our reach. The heart of the Spring heresy will be wrenched out, bringing Eordand one step closer to the unity promised by our oath."
 pelomar_honor_the_ancestors_title:0 "Honor the Ancestors"
 pelomar_honor_the_ancestors_desc:0 "On the outskirts of Pelodard vast expanses of virgin woodland stand, but underneath the roots of the ancient trees lie the tombs and graves of the fallen Peitar throughout the centuries. Ashes turned to soil over the many years nourish the trees, and it is said that woods are safeguarded by spirits of the dead. Let us honour our ancestors by constructing a series of monuments throughout the charnel woods, so that all may know the sacrifices that have been made for us to live today."
 pelomar_prove_oathsworn_name_title:0 "Dynasty of the Oathsworn"
 pelomar_prove_oathsworn_name_desc:0 "Half shrouded in myth, the Oathsworn dynasty derives its name from the oath taken by the first Pelodan. When the first Eordans left the Domandrod after the cataclysms that ravaged the land, the people were all united in the tenets taught by the Fey. As the years passed and lands resettled, some of the Eordans began to favor one season over the rest, abandoning their faith for idolatry. The faithful few, the Peitar, who kept to the traditions were united by the first Pelodan, who swore to restore the balance of the seasons throughout Eordand to the Domandrod Fey. Alas, their cause failed as Pelodan was slain by the heretics, as the enemies of the Eordellon rallied behind the restorers of Arakeprun. Ever since his defeat, the Peitar have been splintered having lost their faith in the Oathsworn, and the leaders of Pelomar have stubbornly sworn one after the oath taken so long ago."
 pelomar_subdue_heretical_worship_title:0 "Subdue the Heretics"
 pelomar_subdue_heretical_worship_desc:0 "It is our mandate to lead the Peitar and bring balance to the seasons. There is no doubt that our cause is just, for we alone are the Oathsworn, Champions of the Fey. All those who dare twist the words of the Domandrod will learn the error of their ways: the time of heresy will be over."
 pelomar_romance_of_the_southrealms_title:0 "Romance of the Southrealms"
 pelomar_romance_of_the_southrealms_desc:0 "Whether it be a fragrant spring day or in the frozen depths of winter, Pelodan X Oathsworn and Leslindel Swiftsword of Sidpar have shined as the radiant example of matrimony. Their love has brought Pelomar and Sidpar together, ending many years of bitter war and decline for the two states."
 pelomar_colltin_purchase_title:0 "Colltin Conference"
 pelomar_colltin_purchase_desc:0 "Pelomar itself is detached from the Domandrod, and our neighbour the dukad of Sidpar controls the province of Colltin that would connect us. Colltin was a contested land before the marriage between our two states, turning it sick with decay and rot from magical intensification of the death from battle. While the land is of little value itself, it is invaluable that we secure our own entry to the Domandrod without relying on our perhaps temporary relations with Sidpar."
 pelomar_aid_to_sidparen_relatives_title:0 "Aid to Sidpar"
 pelomar_aid_to_sidparen_relatives_desc:0 "Our partner of Sidpar has its own share of problems, beset by Summer Court heretics. As Peitar it is our duty to aid our brethren, and as Oathsworn it is our responsibility. Let us bring war to Dearktir and splinter the summer realms!"
 pelomar_gatethrone_of_sidpar_title:0 "Gatethrone of Sidpar"
 pelomar_gatethrone_of_sidpar_desc:0 "For many years our alliance with Sidpar has stood as a shining bulwark of Eordellon purity in the south of Eordan. With the rise of our power in the region, the question of Sidpar's independence has arisen. In the days of Pelodan X, the royal consort Leslindel often wrote to her brother Taelarian Swiftsword that a united Pelomar and Sidpar would be far more effective than as disparate states. And as our Peitar brothers, they are under our Oath subjects of the Champion of the Fey. We will make it clear that they are our subjects now."
 pelomar_swiftsword_legacy_title:0 "Swiftsword Legacy"
 pelomar_swiftsword_legacy_desc:0 "The Swiftswords of Sidpar claimed themselves the reclaimers of the Sarmadfar, aspiring to end the Summer Court by subjugating Dearktir and Murdkather. As more than our oath, let us honour the legacy of the Swiftswords by completing their mission."
 pelomar_spilled_salt_title:0 "Spilled Salt"
 pelomar_spilled_salt_desc:0 "The city of Bagcatir stands defiant against us, mocking us with both their Summer heresy and their supremacy of the Merchant Lords. Their hold over the Sarmadfar trade will be shattered, spilled and dissolved in the ocean like the salt that makes their city rich."
 pelomar_gannag_estuary_development_title:0 "Gannag Estuary Development"
 pelomar_gannag_estuary_development_desc:0 "A mighty river with its source in the Domandrod, the Gannag river serves an important role for irrigation and trade in the south of Eordand. However, the many years of devastating war with the heretics have not allowed this region to prosper. With our hold secured in this region, the greater Sidpar and Gannag river can be developed to be a shining jewel, with subsistence farming replaced by crops that will bring prosperity to all."
 pelomar_wane_of_the_autumn_moon_title:0 "Wane of the Autumn Moon"
 pelomar_wane_of_the_autumn_moon_desc:0 "The lair of the Autumn Court, Einnsag, lies not far from the Vernal heart of Arakeprun. Known for the strength of their legions, the Autumn Court also defends its holy city with the isolating power of the waves. If we can bypass these defences, the Autumn Court's power will have diminished like the waning of the moon."
 pelomar_extinguish_darblath_autumnals_title:0 "Extinguish Darblath Autumnals"
 pelomar_extinguish_darblath_autumnals_desc:0 "The remnants of the Autumn Court rally in Darblath, their northern stronghold against the Snecboth. They will expect no mercy but the chance of rejoining the Eordellon flock. After our conquest of Darblath, it will make a fine bulwark against the Winter Court heretics, a Fortress of the Four Seasons."
 pelomar_winter_winds_vanquished_title:0 "Winter-Winds Vanquished"
 pelomar_winter_winds_vanquished_desc:0 "The north of Eordand is a cold, savage land beset by warfare between the fanatics of Autumn and Winter. Beyond Darblath the two factions battle each other from Jhorgashirr and Gemradcurt: both must be seized and brought back to the tenets of Eordellon."
 pelomar_harmony_of_the_seasons_title:0 "Harmony of the Seasons"
 pelomar_harmony_of_the_seasons_desc:0 "Now that the four seasonal courts of Eordand have been seized and their heresy ended, the Oathsworn may finally be close fulfilling their oath. Pelomar must stand firm that the true path is a united Eordand, balanced in all the seasons, all under the one who carried forth the will of the Fey."
 pelomar_ward_of_summer_title:0 "Ward of Summer"
 pelomar_ward_of_summer_desc:0 "The official gateway into the Domandrod in the south, Sidpar has traditionally been stewarded by the Swiftswords of the Peitar. The Ward of Summer must be controlled by the Peitar lest the fair woods and Fey be corrupted by our heretic brethren."
 pelomar_ward_of_spring_title:0 "Ward of Spring"
 pelomar_ward_of_spring_desc:0 "Arankid stands as the Ward of Spring, closely guarding those who can enter the Domandrod from the west. However, it has fallen into the hands of the Vernal heretics of Arakeprun: it must be returned to the hands of the Peitar."
 pelomar_ward_of_autumn_title:0 "Ward of Autumn"
 pelomar_ward_of_autumn_desc:0 "The Autumn Ward in Orachran, once the sole possession of the Iadth Peitar, served as the staging ground for the Peitar invasion of the Tuathak states of Oreig and Dorcurt. We must ensure that the connection to Domandrod remains secure."
 pelomar_ward_of_winter_title:0 "Ward of Winter"
 pelomar_ward_of_winter_desc:0 "The northern gate to the Domandrod, Dungat watches over the silent and cold woods to the north. Although operated by the Peitar Gateguards of Strutmar, we must ensure that it remains within Peitar control."
 pelomar_fifth_ward_title:0 "The Fifth Ward"
 pelomar_fifth_ward_desc:0 "For as long as anyone could remember, there were four entrances to the Domandrod. One for every season, each faithfully guarded by the Peitar. But for reasons unknown, this harmony was recently broken by the establishment of a fifth gate in Fogrim. Originally seen as a second Winter Ward by the Snecboth, the Hibernal Crusade has recently claimed it as a new Autumn Ward. Regardless of how to classify it, we must take this new ward of the Domandrod and establish proper Eordellon guardians for it."
 pelomar_the_northern_passage_title:0 "The Northern Passage"
 pelomar_the_northern_passage_desc:0 "A narrow stretch of arid land at the eastern edge of the Domandrod connects the lands of the Sarmadfar and the Randrunnse. Held by the Strutmar Peitar, these lands will prove invaluable if we are to expand further north, and bring the Tuathak and Snecboth back into the fold."
