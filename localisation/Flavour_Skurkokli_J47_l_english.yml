 skurkokli_train_berzerkers_title:0 "Train New Berserkers"
 skurkokli_train_berzerkers_desc:0 "Berserkers are our most powerful weapon, though we already have plenty we could always use more. The training of a berserker may result in the deaths of many of our warriors, but their deaths will only fuel the strength and power of those worthy to be drenched in the blood of our enemies."
 skurkokli_warlords_title:0 "A True Warlord"
 skurkokli_warlords_desc:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must not only be ready to rule us in peace but also to lead us into battle to crush our enemies and spread our banner across all the lands. A true Ogrish ruler does not simply rule from the safety of their throne."
 skurkokli_warsmiths_title:0 "Warsmiths"
 skurkokli_warsmiths_desc:0 "Though the venerable wooden club has certainly served our warriors well, adding metal blades, bludgeons, and armor to our armory can only help to improve the power of our clan."
 skurkokli_reinforce_tribe_title:0 "Reinforce Our Tribe"
 skurkokli_reinforce_tribe_desc:0 "The lands of the Wild Clan are notoriously violent and dangerous. To protect our young and infirm while the warriors are away, we must construct new defensive structures across our lands."

 skurkokli_war_hoard_desc:0 "As our warbands stalk the forests and defeat our enemies we've been inundated with a flood of seized loot. We now require a place to house our newfound wealth."
 skurkokli_warm_clothing_title:0 "Furs for Our Warriors"
 skurkokli_warm_clothing_desc:0 "The brutal cold of these lands claims nearly as many warriors as the dangers of war, with a reliable source of fur and cotton we can now begin giving them warmer clothing to protect them from the elements."
 skurkokli_drums_of_war_title:0 "Drums of War"
 skurkokli_drums_of_war_desc:0 "The Shamans of our clan have read the signs and have declared that the time for unity between the tribes of the Wild Clan is nigh. The $DYNASTY$ Clan must be the one to fulfill this destiny, and crush our rivals beneath our might."
 skurkokli_expand_clan_title:0 "Expand the Clan"
 skurkokli_expand_clan_desc:0 "As our rivals fall to our warriors we have found trouble in keeping them in line, so far from our own villages. We should dismantle their villages to expand our own and integrate their magemar, or warriors, into our forces with promises of plunder and food, ensuring the $DYNASTY$ Clan can maintain its position over our lessers."
 skurkokli_on_the_rise_title:0 "On the Rise"
 skurkokli_on_the_rise_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has swiftly become the dominant power amongst the Wild Clan, our warriors have conquered all of our foes and our hoards are overflowing with loot. Now, as we have fulfilled the prophecy presented by the Shamans, we can focus on rebuilding the villages destroyed in war."
 skurkokli_eighth_clan_title:0 "The Eighth Clan"
 skurkokli_eighth_clan_desc:0 "These lands have long been known as the lands of the Eighth Clan, the unnamed Wild Clan, by those in the south. They view us as backwards barbarians, and little more than pests. Meanwhile they gorge themselves on meats they didn't even have to rend off the bones of a living creature themselves and disgrace the heritage of our people. Now, as our Clan rises and our warbands bask in glory, the Wild Clan now has a true name, the mighty $DYNASTY$ Clan of a true Ogrish realm; Skurkokli."
 skurkokli_ogrehome_title:0 "The Home of the Horde"
 skurkokli_ogrehome_desc:0 "In the heart of the dense and frigid forests to the north, we've found an expansive glade which our shamans have decreed that we must relocate the bulk of our horde to. With plenty of material available for construction and a river nearby for water, this land seems destined to become the new cradle of Ogrekind."
 skurkokli_settle_horde_title:0 "Control over the Hordes"
 skurkokli_settle_horde_desc:0 "As the Gorger Lord was preoccupied with his Gorefeasts to draw even more dark power into himself, our hordes prowl the land, carrying out small, if devastating, raids on their own accord. They seem to have forgotten whom it is they serve.\n\nWith Rancor Bloodtooth reinvigorated, these rogue magardon will no longer ignore our demands and the scattered hordes they lead will be brought to heel. Those that refuse will be devoured by the Gorger Lord himself as a warning to all, we will end this here and now!"
 skurkokli_ogre_coast_title:0 "Ogre Coast"
 skurkokli_ogre_coast_desc:0 "As we expand through this great forest we've encountered something we've never seen before; a vast and unending mass of water, and far in the distance a new land full of prey and ripe for our warriors to pillage. Although we may not have much knowledge in the construction of seaworthy ships, our warriors have already crafted some rather crude yet intimidating vessels to carry us to these new shores."
 skurkokli_hulkyard_title:0 "The Hulkyard"
 skurkokli_hulkyard_desc:0 "Perhaps owing to the shoddy and amateurish construction used for our ocean-going hulks, we've found a need for a central port from which to repair and launch raids. Our scouts and shamans have found a prime location, protected from the weather by the bay surrounding it and with a virtually endless supply of timber to repair and build new ships."
 skurkokli_foothold_in_the_lakes_title:0 "Foothold in the Lakes"
 skurkokli_foothold_in_the_lakes_desc:0 "The hordes have been rallied behind our ruler and are expecting us to fulfill our promise of a grand raid and feast never before seen. We must not disappoint them, to begin we must establish a hold on the lands of the humans across the sea."

 skurkokli_consume_the_federation_desc:0 "Our hordes prowl the once proud lands of these puny humans, though they may devour one or two they come across they continue to eagerly await our command to commence a true feeding frenzy. Now is the time for such a command!"
 skurkokli_gaining_entrance_title:0 "Gaining Entrance"
 skurkokli_gaining_entrance_desc:0 "Our scouts have discovered dwarves within their little hidey-holes in the Giant’s Anvil mountains. The stunties are known for their weapon-smithing, quickly into the tunnels their troves will be ours! The little fools should have stayed hidden."
 skurkokli_scour_the_tunnels_title:0 "Scour the Tunnels"
 skurkokli_scour_the_tunnels_desc:0 "These northern dwarves were a tenacious lot, but like all who refuse to flee before us, they too are nothing more than our next meal. It was awfully nice of them to leave us all this armor, weapons, and siege equipment as well. Take it all."
 skurkokli_the_borderlands_title:0 "The Borderlands"
 skurkokli_the_borderlands_desc:0 "Our raiders tell us that the western areas of Cannor are densely populated and we can barely control the drool that slides from our hungry maws at such news. We must secure the western most reaches of Escann in preparation for the invasion of Western Cannor and the feast that will follow.\n\nThe Bloodtooth will not be denied!"
 skurkokli_the_greytide_falters_title:0 "The Graytide Falters"
 skurkokli_the_greytide_falters_desc:0 "The Graytide thought it could contend with the raw power of the ogre horde. They thought wrong. Our mighty warriors are more than a match for even the most savage of orc warriors. One mighty blow from our clubs sends scores of the foul-tasting things hurtling through the air, or smearing them like paste upon the cold ground of the Northern Pass.\n\nThe Gray King can do nothing but watch as his armies falter before our onslaught. His warriors are broken, and his human auxiliaries are hungrily devoured, many while still alive. Now is the time feast upon the exposed heart of the ruined orcish kingdom."
 skurkokli_of_orcs_and_men_title:0 "Of Orcs and Men"
 skurkokli_of_orcs_and_men_desc:0 "The land of Eastern Cannor, or as the locals refer to it, Escann, was once home to a powerful human empire known as Castanor that was toppled long ago. Replacing it, were many feudal kingdoms of men whose nations were eventually destroyed by the rampaging armies of the Dookanson, known as the Greentide.\n\nNow all that remains are small petty fiefs, adventuring bands, and scattered orc and goblin tribes. This diverse collection of delectable meals will fuel the ogre horde as we spill from the northern forests into the heart of this land."
 skurkokli_a_new_home_title:0 "New Home of the Horde"
 skurkokli_a_new_home_desc:0 "This husk of a city was once the capital of the human empire of Castanor. Now, it will act as a new capital, an ogrish capital. This city will be worthy of our great horde and will act as a focal point as we continue to expand and move our people into the heart of Escann."
 skurkokli_the_ogre_horde_settles_title:0 "The Ogre Horde Settles"
 skurkokli_the_ogre_horde_settles_desc:0 "The journey from the mountains of the east was long and arduous, but it was worth it. Escann is a land of such delicious opportunity, we really must thank the people here for being such hospitable hosts. How kind of them to even offer themselves up as a welcoming feast. Perhaps when we have gorged ourselves enough on their flesh, those that remain could be of use…"
 skurkokli_along_the_upper_alen_title:0 "Along the Upper Alen"
 skurkokli_along_the_upper_alen_desc:0 "The horde will sweep up the great river known to the people of Cannor as the Alen, into the mineral rich hills and mountains of the western Serpentspine Mountains. The paltry forces arrayed against us, be they orc, human, or otherwise will be crushed under our massive iron boots. Control of the Upper Alen will mean control of Inner Castanor itself."
 skurkokli_land_of_the_ogres_title:0 "Great Realm of the Ogres"
 skurkokli_land_of_the_ogres_desc:0 "The humans have been broken and the orcs humbled, the lands of Eastern Cannor are ours. No longer will it be referred to Escann, for we have eaten all the tongues in this land that would refer to it as such.\n\nHenceforth, this land will be known as the Great Realm of the Ogres, Shevril Amregh vra in Skurkhas, or Skurkhamregh, or Ogrerealm for short. None shall question our authority here!"
 skurkokli_orc_fodder_title:0 "Nakturkh Fodder"
 skurkokli_orc_fodder_desc:0 "When the Greentide was broken, thousands of nakturkh, orcs, were left scattered throughout the Ogrerealm. Many of these wretches now work our fields, mines, and foundries but some refuse to be broken. They have fight in them still, and if it is a fight they want, then it is a fight they shall have.\n\nTie the disgusting tasting cretins together and send them in as the first wave of every fight. Let their bodies soak up the arrows, bolts, and bullets that would normally be intended for our mighty magemar!"
 skurkokli_horde_marches_west_title:0 "The Horde Marches West"
 skurkokli_horde_marches_west_desc:0 "Our returning scouts tell us of the diverse and plentiful creatures west, beyond the Northern Pass, in the lands of Cannor. It is in these lands that our maddening hunger shall be sated, for we will feast upon the abundance of life there.\n\nThe Gorger Lord drives the horde before him to consume all, as if it were a swarm of locusts falling upon the fields. The ogres of Skurkokli begin our unrelenting march west."
 skurkokli_the_despoilers_come_title:0 "Despoilers Come"
 skurkokli_the_despoilers_come_desc:0 "We have forced our way through the barren and dangerous northern forests, driving all manner of creature and beast, great and small, before us. Now, our horde sits upon the borders of an orcish kingdom. A kingdom that will be brought to ruin.\n\nWe have smashed aside all those that would oppose our relentless march west and these little orcs, like so many others, will be trampled beneath our boots as if they were nothing more than tiny little insects."
 skurkokli_vore_vrorensbay_title:0 "Descend Upon Vrorensbay"
 skurkokli_vore_vrorensbay_desc:0 "The Gray King and his little rabble that plays at being an army has failed to stop our horde, and now his seat of power lies open to us. The Gorger Lord spurs us forward, promising us a grand feast that will be had once the foul-tasting orcs are crushed and this kingdom of pretenders lies in ruins.\n\nLike our gods did so long ago, we will smash through their defenses and swarm across orcish held territories into the lands that lie beyond, for these lands are ripe with humans, whose flesh will fill our bellies until we nearly burst."
 skurkokli_ogre_raiders_title:0 "Raid the West"
 skurkokli_ogre_raiders_desc:0 "As we contend with the orcs of the Graytide, we shall send a small contingent of our swiftest ogres further west past this cold kingdom. There they will raid the frontiers of the mightier kingdoms to help with our endless war efforts."
 skurkokli_orc_slaves_work_or_be_eaten_title:0 "Work or Be Eaten"
 skurkokli_orc_slaves_work_or_be_eaten_desc:0 "The great horde of the ogres marches on its stomach, and with how much food a single ogre can eat, let alone thousands, rations can become scarce in a short amount of time. Luckily for us, orcs are foul tasting and the greenskins weren’t entirely devoured by our ravenous, encroaching armies. We will put them to work sowing the fields and raising our cattle. They can provide the food, or they will be the food."
 skurkokli_march_to_the_woods_title:0 "March to the Woods"
 skurkokli_march_to_the_woods_desc:0 "The march south is ceaseless and unrelenting. Nothing is able to stop our progress, or so we thought.\n\nFar to the south lies the Deepwoods, the realm of fey, wild orcs, and even wilder elves. Every raiding party we send into the woods does not return and assaulting the great wood will be more trouble than it is worth. Let the people of the wild have their trees and bushes. Let this great forest mark our southern borders as our insatiable appetites look further west."
 skurkokli_the_god_eaters_title:0 "The God Eaters"
 skurkokli_the_god_eaters_desc:0 "We Ogres are hungry, so we Ogres eat. We eat our enemies, we eat each other, and we even ate our gods. There are many gods and peoples on this world, and each possess power that we want.\n\nSo, we will leave our mountains, forests, and swamps and we will scour this world. We will consume them and their gods and take their power for ourselves."
 skurkokli_scourge_of_the_gods_title:0 "Scourge of the Gods"
 skurkokli_scourge_of_the_gods_desc:0 "The weak, pathetic gods of Cannor did nothing as we devoured their worshippers and sacked their cities. Let us put more dirt in their eye by building profane monuments upon the desecrated ruins of their temples and monasteries. Let these mockeries of the gods forever stand as a reminder to all those that bear witness to them of who truly rules here."
 skurkokli_eaters_of_the_world_title:0 "Eaters of the World"
 skurkokli_eaters_of_the_world_desc:0 "Western Cannor falls before us and the lands we have taken will be stripped clean before being resettled by our own people. Those that have managed to survive our onslaught will be picked apart and slowly consumed like a sickly beast being set upon by a pack of hungry wolves."
 skurkokli_a_new_swamp_title:0 "Swamp Keep of Balmire"
 skurkokli_a_new_swamp_desc:0 "We have discovered another ruined citadel of Balgar located deep within the swamps of Balmire, the Mossmouth ogres that joined us on our trek west as we passed the Serpent’s Vale, have petitioned to rebuild the fortress and take up custodianship of the marshlands. We shall grant them this boon; the swamp-dwelling ogres will prove a deterrent for would be attackers from further west."
 skurkokli_orc_slaves_mines_of_marrhold_title:0 "Mines of Marrhold"
 skurkokli_orc_slaves_mines_of_marrhold_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Marrhold may have been swept away by our tide, but the dwarven made hold that was their capital remains. Within that hold are iron mines that can be used to outfit and equip our warriors. The seemingly limitless number of orcs in the surrounding era are strong and will make fine slaves within the mines. Put them to work!"
 skurkokli_this_land_is_our_land_title:0 "This Land is Our Land"
 skurkokli_this_land_is_our_land_desc:0 "Inner Castanor is considered the heartland of the horde, and with it fully under our control, we are able to expand beyond its borders into the rest of Cannor. Unlike the harsh conditions of the Forbidden Plains, here in the lush and verdant lands of Escann the tribes thrive under the banner of Skurkokli. Orc slaves produce enough food to keep our people satiated for a time, and our new great capital of Skurkolba, Ogreheart, flourishes under the watchful red eyes of the Gorger Lord; he is ever cognizant of the daily meat shipments entering the city.\n\nAll manner of wealth and plunder flow into our new lands as nation after nation are pillaged and consumed by our ravenous hosts. These looted treasures that we acquire will be instrumental in funding our continued conquests here in Escann and beyond."
 skurkokli_skull_gnasher_resettled_title:0 "Skull Gnasher Gourmands"
 skurkokli_skull_gnasher_resettled_desc:0 "Of all the races of Cannor, none are as tasty as the halflings. The Skull Gnasher tribe has developed a new way to prepare the tiny creatures calling it a Halfling Skewer. These 3-fried halflings on a stick are famous all over the Ogrerealm.\n\nIt is from their great bakeries located in Naktuprala, or Smallfeast, of what was once the city known as South Viswall, that ogres come from all over to stuff their maws full of these tasty treats."
 skurkokli_bronzegut_resettled_title:0 "Bronzegut Winelords"
 skurkokli_bronzegut_resettled_desc:0 "The Bronzegut are known to be some of the biggest and toughest of all the ogres and they like to fight as much as they like to drink. They have taken an especially liking to the spirits of Lorent, particularly Madalairey White. The chief of the Bronzegut has taken up residence within the old capital of Lorent, Lorentainé, and has renamed it and the surrounding land to Argnmotsa or the Wineland."
 skurkokli_orc_slaves_bronze_cannons_title:0 "Bronze Boomsticks"
 skurkokli_orc_slaves_bronze_cannons_desc:0 "Our khavys, or cannons in the common tongue, are like adults standing next to children when compared to the smaller races’ weapons, however, even with their small size they still proved to be just as deadly if not more so than our own. Our engineers have studied their cannons and found them to be made of bronze instead of iron. Put the orcs to work mining copper to be used to make the bronze that will be molded into our new weapons."
 skurkokli_tallyman_of_the_horde_title:0 "Goldlord of the Gray Fist"
 skurkokli_tallyman_of_the_horde_desc:0 "Overlord Gaseous Goldmaw, or to give him is formal title, Goldlord Gaseous Clanborrower Wyvernsmasher Wallbreaker Vaultmaster Goldmaw the Surprisingly Smelly, is one of the fattest, greediest, and most of all, smelliest ogres of the horde. He is also quite the tallyman and has been granted the privilege of minting the coins for Skurkokli by the Gorger Lord himself."
 skurkokli_the_goldlord_title:0 "The Goldlord's Great Vault"
 skurkokli_the_goldlord_desc:0 "Goldlord Gaseous Clanborrower Wyvernsmasher Wallbreaker Vaultmaster Goldmaw the Surprisingly Smelly and the Gray Fist tribe have been tasked with establishing a great vault within the city of Skurkolba. From here the Goldlord will meticulously count and recount the newly minted coins coming out of the great city into the rest of the Ogrerealm.\n\nNothing will get past the cursed, greedy eyes of Gaseous as the bulbous ogre sits upon his opulent palanquin that is carried around by his orcish slaves. After all, he is far too rich to walk and only peasants use their legs."
 skurkokli_bakeries_of_viswall_title:0 "Bakeries of Smallfeast"
 skurkokli_bakeries_of_viswall_desc:0 "The halflings have proven to be so popular that at the rate they are being eaten the entire race will go extinct. The gourmands have come up with a brilliant solution to our problem: breeding farms. As our slaves raise cattle to feed our armies, so to shall we raise halflings so that they will always be in supply. We must construct farming estates that are well defended by more disciplined ogres to breed the scrumptious little morsels. A chef’s work is never done!"
 skurkokli_land_of_wine_title:0 "Land of Wine"
 skurkokli_land_of_wine_desc:0 "Ogres come from all over the Ogrerealm to take part in the wines that are produced by the Bronzegut tribe and their whining slaves. However, the current halls are crowded due to being built by weak human hands. It is time we upgrade our infrastructure and construct new feast halls to accommodate our warriors as they drink and feast upon the spoils of Lorent."
 skurkokli_slavers_title:0 "Slaves of Skurkokli"
 skurkokli_slavers_desc:0 "As we expand deeper and deeper into Escann, we consume. However, there are some things even we won’t eat. Orcs. They taste terrible, and even if the Gorger Lord himself finds their taste to his liking, the rest of Skurkokli does not. So, we will use them for labor. They will do the menial tasks of working in our mines, sowing our fields, and producing everything the horde needs.\n\nA grand slave market will be established within Avlurobla, the lower section of our great capital of Skurkolba, to handle the influx of the green-skinned wretches. Perhaps the scattered members of the Chainlord clan could be of some use…"
 skurkokli_orc_slaves_industry_title:0 "Industrial Servitude"
 skurkokli_orc_slaves_industry_desc:0 "Thanks to the Chainlords, our orc slave initiative has proven to be an invaluable asset to fuel the ogre horde as we continue our all-consuming march across Cannor. As we continue to grow and expand, we learn of new things such as industry and mass production. Let us use our orc “workers” to fill our new factories to produce more for Great Skurkokli."
 skurkokli_trunk_basher_resettled_title:0 "Trunk Bashers and Chainlords"
 skurkokli_trunk_basher_resettled_desc:0 "The world holds the view that we ogres are nothing more than stereotypical simple-minded brutes. For the most part this is not true, though, there are some among us who are as every bit as dumb and violent as the small-folk think we are.\n\nThe Trunk Basher tribe lives up the to image of the big, violent, and most of all stupid bully. However, their stupidity gives them a one-track mind, which can be useful, especially when they are hunting prey to hurt or eat. So, it is no surprise that the members of the reinstated Achtejardon, or Chainlord clan, were given control over the tribe after their success in establishing efficient slave rings within the horde.\n\nWith the combined might of the Trunk Bashers and the Chainlords, the united ogres took control of the Gawedi capital of Gaweton after they sacked the city and feasted upon several members of the Gawedi royal family. It is from this place, now known as Onathalkelak, or Slave City, that the Chainlord led Trunk Bashers scour the countryside for fierce Alenic slaves who refuse to leave their homeland, to be sent to the rest of the Ogrerealm."
 skurkokli_slaves_of_the_alen_title:0 "Slavelords of the Alen"
 skurkokli_slaves_of_the_alen_desc:0 "The Trunk Basher and Chainlord collaboration has been so successful that the rickety markets within the Slave City are overcrowded with Alenic slaves, making it hard to control hungry ogres who fill the markets every day. It is not uncommon to have a human slave snatched from the line up and devoured without being paid for.\n\nThis cannot stand. We must build improved markets and stalls to better organize our auctions and provide more room for our Trunk Basher enforcers to protect our slaves from hungry, and most of all moneyless, ogres. The Chainlord slave masters don’t run on charity."
 skurkokli_reachs_reckoning_title:0 "The Reach's Reckoning"
 skurkokli_reachs_reckoning_desc:0 "Let the lands of the Reachmen, the Alen, and Gray Orcs be consumed in a gluttonous orgy of hunger.  Let loose the hordes of Skurkokli to devour all who are either too brave, or too stupid to run."
 skurkokli_ogre_wars_title:0 "The Ogre Wars"
 skurkokli_ogre_wars_desc:0 "All manner of adventurers and mercenaries have flooded into Escann seeking fame and fortune, unfortunately for them, this land is now ours. Let our mighty hordes rush south and roll over them like a tide of destruction. Let us feast upon their carcasses in celebration of our victories. Let the Ogre Wars for Escann commence!"
 skurkokli_coldharbor_hulkyard_title:0 "Cold Harbor Hulkyard"
 skurkokli_coldharbor_hulkyard_desc:0 "The Hulkyard proved to be invaluable in our fight against the puny humans of the Lake Federation. Let us build another on the isle of Cold Harbor so that the Saltbreaths can build a new fleet of ogrish Hulks to prey upon the merchant vessels of the northern seas."
 skurkokli_ironclaw_resettled_title:0 "Ironclaw of Wexkeep"
 skurkokli_ironclaw_resettled_desc:0 "The Ironclaw tribe and its feared berserkers, clad in thick metal from head-to-toe, led the charge against Wexkeep. The Wexonard, true to their Alenic heritage, fought bravely, though the outcome of the battle was inevitable. Their projectiles, whether from gun, crossbow, or cannon bounced harmlessly of the thick plating of the Ironclaw warriors, as they tore into the ranks of the humans with their hand-blades.\n\nWith Wexkeep now ours, we will hold a great feast here, devouring the humans, so that their bravery will become a part of our own warriors. In return for delivering such a feast, the Ironclaw will be granted ownership Wexkeep and have chosen to rename it to the Iron Citadel, Rk'narnktar, after their own tribe, and in honor of the iron will of the Wexonard people."
 skurkokli_ironclaw_forges_title:0 "Ironhill Foundries"
 skurkokli_ironclaw_forges_desc:0 "The province of Ironhill near Rk'narnktar is one of the greatest sources of iron in all of Cannor. Members of the Ironclaw tribe who can trace their lineage back to the Steelgrinder clan have offered to set up mining operations, workshops, and foundries to produce the iron and steel that will be used to equip our armies. Small portions of another ore, called coal, can also be found here, and will provide an excellent source of fuel for our furnaces."
 skurkokli_ogre_tribes_north_title:0 "Tribes of the Northern Pass"
 skurkokli_ogre_tribes_north_desc:0 "There are many small, scattered tribes of ogres throughout the Northern Pass. Alone they were too weak to stop the gray-skinned orc interlopers, but with the passing of our Great Ogre Horde, these small bands and tribes eagerly join us in our relentless march west. They are a bitter lot and are quite eager to break the gray orcs of the north."
 skurkokli_ogre_island_title:0 "Saltbreath Island"
 skurkokli_ogre_island_desc:0 "The Saltbreaths have asked for more lucrative hunting grounds after ravaging the lands surrounding the Giant’s Grave Sea. Let us give them them the Isle of Tef Eborthíl to continue their heinous acts of piracy against not only the people of Cannor, but of Sarhal and Bulwar as well."
 skurkokli_hungerport_hulkyard_title:0 "Hungerport Hulkyard"
 skurkokli_hungerport_hulkyard_desc:0 "Within the harbor of Vulshimortif, or Hungerport, within the conquered human city of Eborthíl, the Saltbreath have built a new Hulkyard. Within the new Hungerport Hulkyard, they have begun construction of new and improved Hulks that no longer suffer from shoddy craftsmanship."
 skurkokli_devouring_armada_title:0 "All-Devouring Armada"
 skurkokli_devouring_armada_desc:0 "From the Hulkyard of Vulshimortif comes new Hulks. These Hulks will be fashioned with great metal jaws that will allow our new Feast Fleet to gorge themselves upon enemy vessels. This all-devouring armada will be used to feast upon, not only the ships, but the tasty treats who operate these ships."
 skurkokli_war_against_fed_title:0 "War Against the Federation"
 skurkokli_war_against_fed_desc:0 "The Northern Pass is an inhospitable and dangerous place with not much in the way of supplies, particularly food. Before we begin our march west, let us wage war against the puny humans of the Lake Federation. We will invade their little island home and strip it bare so that our great march westward is well stocked with plenty of meat."
 skurkokli_ogre_piracy_title:0 "Piracy Begins"
 skurkokli_ogre_piracy_desc:0 "In their arrogance, the Lake Federation believed that they have sole dominion of the waves. No longer is this the case with our Hulks prowling the seas. Though our ships may not be as durable as the humans, they are still larger, although that means little because what we lack is true seafaring leadership.\n\nBarboza Saltbreath, a red bearded, eyepatch wearing, ogre mercenary has eagerly stepped forward with his experience abroad with piracy to lead our fleet of Ogrish Hulks."
 skurkokli_ogre_vanguard_title:0 "The Ogrish Vanguard"
 skurkokli_ogre_vanguard_desc:0 "The Greentide that spilled from the Serpentspine Mountains and destroyed the Chivalric Kingdoms of Escann, paved the way for Ogrekind to dominate what is now the Ogrerealm. Now, it is our turn. Rottenstep is where the orcish rabble failed to penetrate the borders of Western Cannor, it is here our own vanguard will take the same path and open the way into the very heart of Western Cannor."
 skurkokli_the_ogretide_title:0 "The Ogretide"
 skurkokli_the_ogretide_desc:0 "We have succeeded where our orc slaves failed so many years ago. The western lands of Cannor are open to us now and from here we will strike out in all directions, killing, maiming, and eating all who stand before us. The great kingdoms of the Alen people and Lorent shall be drowned in a river of blood and the Empire of Anbennar shall be flayed and gutted like a succulent pig.\n\nJust as the orcs led by the Dookanson washed over east, a tidal wave of ogres led by the Gorger Lord Rancor Bloodtooth comes to consume the west. The great apocalypse has come to Cannor. Let the Ogretide begin!"
 skurkokli_saltbreath_pirates_title:0 "Saltbreath Pirates"

The spell causes Rancor to howl in pain. Enraged, he turns his hungry attention to the ogre mage. The battle between the two rages for some time, with the ogre mage even raising the corpse of Sughra Bronzegut to fight for him, before exhaustion begins to set in and Rancor’s unnatural presence starts to affect the ogre mage’s mind. As the weary necromancer attempts to shake the ravenous influence creeping into his mind to cast another spell, the tireless Rancor is upon him. The massive ogre easily lifts the ogre mage into the air with one hand, and with his eyes glowing crimson, the skin on Rancor’s head cracks, splitting apart and exposing him for what he truly is. Karigan screams in horror as the gluttony demon before him opens its great maw wide and bites down, not into his flesh, but his very spirit. All the ogre mage can do is struggle in Rancor’s vice grip as his soul is pulled from his body and devoured.\n\nThe ogres that have gathered watch in equal amounts terror and amazement, as the monstrous being from the Abyss in front of them feasts upon the essence of the last leader of Skurkokli. As Rancor greedily devours the soul of Karigan, the throng of ogres can feel the maddening hunger increase. A hunger that the presence in their minds… a voice within their heads, tells them only Rancor Bloodtooth can fill.\n\nFinishing his meal, Rancor lowers Karigan back to his feet and orders the necromancer to kneel.

We will gorge ourselves upon the Federation and when we are done with that, we will gorge ourselves upon the rest of the lands east of Great Skurkokli, stripping it bare. All of it."

 ogre.21.t:0 "The Doom of Cannor"
 ogre.21.d:0 "Mark this day as the shattering of Western Cannor by the ravenous hosts of the Gorger Lord. The elves, men, dwarves, halflings, and all others who call this place home have had their lands rent asunder and their families feasted upon. The people of Western Cannor shall bear witness to our slavering magnificence and sit in despair as all they hold dear finds a new home within our cavernous bellies. Those foolish enough to stay will watch as tribes of ogres claim what was once theirs before they too are hunted and devoured and the cowards that flee will only be delaying the inevitable and will die tired. The all-consuming ogre horde will come for all in the end. We are the doom of their world!"
 ogre.21.a:0 "We are the Great Apocalypse!"
 ogre.22.t:0 "The Goldlord"
 ogre.22.d:0 "Several Gray Fist hunters have discovered gold nuggets sparkling in the river that flows through their tribal territory. As two of the hunters discuss keeping the claim for themselves, the third, a particularly fat and flatulent ogre known as Gaseous, brutally kills and eats his companions. ‘The shiny rocks in the water belong to the Gorger Lord and no one else.’ After having his hearty meal, Gaseous makes his way to the gathering at Skurkokli.\n\nThe mighty Rancor Bloodtooth is so pleased at the ruthlessness and zealous loyalty of the Gray Fist ogre he awards him a magical jeweled ring, granting Gaseous heightened intelligence, but cursing him with a love of numbers. The Gorger Lord grants Gaseous the position of tallyman of the horde, making him chieftain of the Gray Fist tribe and giving him the authority to mine, prospect, and mint the gold that was discovered. It is on this day the Goldlord, Gaseous Goldmaw is born."
 ogre.22.a:0 "Let the count begin!"
 ogre.23.t:0 "The Ogre of Unknown Origins"
 ogre.23.d:0 "Anarchy!\n\nA great beast of an ogre has come from the northern forests and with him arrives a hungering madness. Just being near the towering, miasma spewing ogre has sent even the most reserved of Fathides into a feeding frenzy. Rancor Bloodtooth, an unnatural creature who stands as tall as a troll and possesses a single black, upward curving horn jutting from the center of his forehead, has come for the leaders of the Wild Clan whose tribes make up the horde of Skurkokli.\n\nThe first to fall are the leaders of the Trunk Basher, Ironclaw, Skull Gnashers, and Gray Fist tribes. Rancor fights as a beast, killing, and devouring each of the chieftains before taking control of their tribes. As tribe after tribe falls under his control the hungering madness that exudes off him begins to seep its way through each member of a tribe driving them into a bloodlust.\n\nThe last remaining chieftains of the horde, the mighty Sughra of the Bronzegut and the ogre mage Karigan of the Frosthide, conspire to bring down the beast in one-on-one combat. Sughra will be the champion, and with protective spells cast by Karigan, the large ogre knows victory is assured."
 ogre.23.a:0 "The Bronzegut chieftain challenges!"
 ogre.24.t:0 "The Reach's Reckoning"
 ogre.24.d:0 "We have devoured so much, and yet the Gorger Lord still hungers, and all Skurkokli hungers with him. There is nothing in the world that can match our ravenous appetite, but if one thing could come close, it is a wildfire, burning and consuming and leaving naught but ash behind.\n\nSo let us bring fire to the Reach. Fire in the forests, flushing out beast and bird into our waiting gullets. Fire in the once-proud cities, leaving all the charred meat -- and abandoned loot -- we could want. And, of course, Fire in the Gorger Lord's eyes as our great leader surveys the aftermath.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] still hungers. Still craves more. But when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looks upon a forest made ash, cities made meat -- [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is pleased, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] turns to return to [Root.Capital.GetName] with the spoils."

 ogre.25.d.war:0 "The mighty Rancor Bloodtooth has been ambushed while the war rages by a band of cowardly heroes looking to end his genocidal reign. The battle is fierce, and the Gorger Lord slays many of his would-be killers. However, one of the party member’s magical blades strikes true, impaling He Who Hungers and fatally wounding him.\n\nAs he dies, his skin melts away exposing the true horrifying form of the Gorger Lord, a great winged gluttony demon of the Abyss. Black miasma spills from every orifice of the nightmare as it begins to cackle madly. The twisted demonic form of Rancor seems to collapse in on itself like a dying star before suddenly, it expands outwards glowing bright. A massive explosion heralds the "death" of the Gorger Lord, sending him back into the Abyss while simultaneously killing the heroes who sought to cut him down.\n\nWithout the influence of the Gorger Lord, the ogres of Skurkokli are thrown into chaos and upheaval. The chieftains of the hordes begin to scheme for power even as rumors swirl that a massive one-horned ogre has been spotted moving through the forests towards the capital…"

He says nothing of how he escaped death and no ogre is foolish enough to ask for fear of becoming the Gorger Lord’s next meal. All that is for certain is He Who Hungers is here, and his ever-oppressive presence will continue to push the ogre horde forward to devour more in our quest to sate our people’s never-ending hunger. Let the feast continue..."
 ogre.26.a:0 ""You cannot kill me for I am beyond your comprehension!""
 ogre.27.t:0 "The Feast Fleet Feeds"
 ogre.27.d:0 "The Northmen are feared by many. True reavers of the high seas, pillaging and raiding wherever they please. Well, unfortunately for them these oceans aren’t big enough for the two of us.\n\nFirst we start with their fleets. Their pesky little boats prove quite the nuisance for our Hulks. Their design makes it easy for their warriors to board our ships, even manage to sink plenty of our vessels too, the little buggers. Unfortunately for them, they don’t realize just how many of us there are; an entire mountain range worth. They can only hope to slow the inevitable. More and more of their little ships are sent to the bottom of the sea and more and more of the infamous reavers of the north are roasted and eaten by our crews. Soon, their fleets stop coming and we take the fight to them.\n\nThey put up token resistance, but what can you do when the majority of your armies aren’t even soldiers? We will say, it is awfully nice of them to send meals our way, so we don’t get hungry while we are here. Nothing is spared, everything edible is taken or eaten. Their plunder becomes ours. However, the true prize is the captured Northmen ships that will be reverse engineered into lower draft vessels that will accompany our Hulks and raid the coastal towns and cities. The world will look upon our black flags and quake in fear, because they know the Saltbreath and their Feast Fleet is here. Yo ho!"
 ogre.27.a:0 "Yar har! Eat the reavers and take their plunder!"
 ogre.28.t:0 "The Devouring of Dostanor"
 ogre.28.d:0 "Without Castle Corvur to hold back the horde lead by Vakrag Deathmaw, the Hand of the Gorger Lord, the rest of the lands of the fallen Dark Lord are open to us. His great Dark Legion is crushed in their black armor by our powerful hands, as if they were nothing more than tins of food, while rest of the motley militia that makes up the human military break ranks and flee in terror. The Dark Lord and his Vampire Court are captured and burned to ash in the sunlight, their remains will be used for seasoning.\n\nThe desperate peasantry who don’t manage to make it to Western Cannor, attempt to brave the thick forests of the Deepwood or the murky swamps of Daravan’s Folly. Unfortunately for them, those that seek shelter in the woods are consumed by our pursuing warriors, while the rabble fleeing into the swamps are assailed by the Mossmouth, who drag their screaming quarry deep into the bogs to be feasted upon later.\n\nThe victorious Vakrag has kept his promise to the Gorger Lord and delivered him a great victory in the War of the Vampire. The mighty magardon celebrates by sprinkling the ashes of the slain vampires upon the corpses of their most trusted generals, before hungrily devouring his now well-seasoned dinner. Laughter erupts in the camp as the Hand states that, "Vampires taste like pepper.""
 ogre.28.a:0 "The Masquerade ends!"
 ogre.29.t:0 "Ogrekind United"
 ogre.29.d:0 "The shamans speak of stories telling of the last time Ogrekind was united as a singular people. These stories say it was when we served our gods as their laborers and builders thousands of years ago. Now, a new age is upon us. As we claim Escann for ourselves, the last of the ogre diaspora make their way to the Ogrerealm. With their arrival, the Gorger Lord has now united all the ogres of the west under the banner of Great Skurkokli.\n\nAs our horde continues its relentless march, the procession of our people stretches from one horizon to the other, and the very ground shakes as if Halann itself trembles before our might. Everything flees before us as the horde swarms into the rest of Cannor from our new home in the Ogrerealm, hungry for the feast that awaits us. Ogrekind has been united this day, as one people with one purpose. A purpose that was delivered to us by Rancor Bloodtooth, He Who Hungers. To lay claim to all that we set our eyes upon and consume it to sate our ever-persistent hunger. Glory to Ogrekind!"
 ogre.29.a:0 "One people, one purpose!"
 ogre.30.t:0 "We Hunger, For More"
 ogre.30.d:0 "We have united the ogres of the mountains, and the ranks of the horde swell with thousands upon thousands of rotund bodies. Unfortunately, the great Rancor Bloodtooth’s unnatural gluttonous presence has caused our people to devour any food that can be found within the mountains. Choices must be made to keep our ever-persistent hunger at bay.\n\nTo the west lie the lands of Cannor. Our scouts have reported that these lands are rich in food and resources, which will allow us to sustain ourselves and indulge our ravenous hunger, indefinitely. However, to get there we must traverse the dangerous and desolate Northern Pass. Here, food is scarce and monsters aplenty. We can choose to force the horde westward in an ill-prepared march that will allow us to reach our new lands sooner but, doing so will cause our people to suffer from starvation during the migration.\n\n...or we can take a different approach.\n\nTo the east is an island full of tasty treats. The human realm of the Lake Federation is a land of bounty that will provide the horde with ample food stores. Warring against the Lake Federation will delay our migration, however; from the crops they harvest, to the humans themselves, our larders will be well stocked for our long arduous journey west, to Cannor.\n\nWhichever option we choose, it must be made now for the horde grows hungry…"
 ogre.30.a:0 "Begin the march west, we will feast on the fallen and those that complain!"
 ogre.30.b:0 "From the sea we will come, the bounty of the Lake Federation will be ours!"
 ogre.31.t:0 "Voice of the Gods"
 ogre.31.d:0 "For the most part, Rancor Bloodtooth cares little if the occasional ogre becomes curious of the religions of the small-folk. Most musings are short lived due to either his own unholy influence that is exerted over the horde, or the ogre in question becomes bored of the subject on their own. As long as his needs are met first, including a steady supply of meat from sapient beings finding its way onto his dinner table, he is content to let the people of Skurkokli do as they please in their day-to-day lives. However, when an individual’s curiosity gets the better of them and they begin to spread the teachings of the gods, this cannot be ignored. The ogres of Skurkokli are the Gorger Lord’s by right and no being, be they a fellow demon or one of the many pathetic gods, will usurp his position.\n\nThe Gorger Lord is swift in his retribution to those that would unshackle Ogrekind from his will. The would-be leaders of this new religion are devoured in a gory spectacle in front of the gathered horde, and with their deaths, Rancor Bloodtooth declares that those he cast down were blasphemers and that he alone is the true voice of the gods. With his oppressive presence coupling with the people of Skurkokli’s newfound religious zealotry, the horde cannot deny him. It only makes sense that the Gorger Lord’s words ring true, for he has delivered upon them lands to strip bare and feasts aplenty. Yes, the mighty Rancor Bloodtooth, He Who Hungers, speaks with the voice of gods. He is the true prophet of Ogrekind and to deny him is to deny the gods themselves… because that is what the little voice in the back of their heads tell them, and that honeyed voice is never wrong.\n\nKnowing his fiendish grip upon the horde of Skurkokli remains unbroken, the Gorger Lord Rancor Bloodtooth, He Who Hungers, and now Voice of the Gods, gives a blood-soaked smile as HIS ogres heap adulation upon their new prophet."
 ogre.31.a:0 "Our way is the only correct path. The gods demand we feast upon the heretics!"
 ogre.32.t:0 "Seeds of Hunger"
 ogre.32.d:0 "When Rancor Bloodtooth first appeared he brought with him a gluttonous corruption that worms its way into the psyche of any intelligent creature who consumes and relishes the taste of sapient beings. We ogres are known as maneaters and have become the perfect hosts for this seed of hunger. As this otherworldy influence begins to take hold, no matter how much we eat, we never feel full. Even our great feasts only stave off the growing hunger pains for a short time, and each meal requires more food than the last to soothe the ache in our stomachs. Mercifully, He Who Hungers is a giving Baozh and has promised us endless feasts, declaring this world to be a grand banquet that will rid us of the constant rumbling of our bellies.\n\nAs long as the Gorger Lord’s appetite is satiated, so too shall ours. We know this to be true, because why would that friendly voice whispering to us within our heads lie to us. It would never lie to us!\n\n…would it?"
 ogre.32.a:0 "Is the voice getting louder?"
