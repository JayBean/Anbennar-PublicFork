The strongest pressed their hands up to their ears so hard they were nearly crushed, those that could not found their eyes vibrating as their noses bled, and the least fortunate were left drooling on the floor--their eyes whited out, their lives lost.\n\nWhen the wails ended, the people closest to the chilling song were changed irreparably, and seek only to leave, to leave with at least some of their sanity intact."

She started pacing and mumbling, shouting threats in some unknown language which slowly turned into screeching… and then she started to change. White feathers started to sprout from under her robe, creeping up her skin, enveloping her, shrinking her… until only a goose emerged, still screeching angrily, waddling out into the outside world." All the surviving victims of the hag from [Root.GetName] tell the same unlikely story, which we have no choice but to accept as true."

  aw_hags.130.d:0 "£icon_adventurers_wanted_banner£\nThere is an increasing amount of disappearances in and around [Root.GetName], as the hag that infests the province has gained more power, as she is increasing her amount of thralls."

  aw_hags.200.d:0 "£icon_adventurers_wanted_banner£\nThere appears to be a group of mages which has been experimenting with new kinds of magic, openly taunting other mages who do not seem to be able to grasp their new spells. More and more, people have begun to suspect that there is something unnatural about this new magic, but for the time being, magical research is very much focused on getting these new spells to work."

  aw_hags.201.d:0 "£icon_adventurers_wanted_banner£\nA noble house, formerly of somewhat lower standing, has rapidly gained a tremendous amount of prestige and influence. Initially, this was thought to simply be good diplomacy and good luck, but recently there have been indicators that this house may have struck a deal with a hag. We have no way to prove this, and we can do little as they consolidate more power at our expense."

  aw_hags.202.d:0 "£icon_adventurers_wanted_banner£\nRecently, there have been several incidents where members of the clergy have demonstrated behaviour that can only be described as unholy. We have now been able to trace at least one of these incidents to a member of the clergy making a deal with a hag, but it is starting to become very clear this is not an isolated incident."

  aw_hags.203.d:0 "£icon_adventurers_wanted_banner£\nRecently, the wealth of three merchant families has increased significantly, as they have bought out many of their smaller competitors. It started with one, quickly followed by the other two. We initially paid it little mind, but the competition between them has become increasingly bitter, at the cost of the welfare of our population. Now, we have indications that hag magic is involved in these conflicts, and may have been from the very start."

  aw_hags.204.d:0 "£icon_adventurers_wanted_banner£\nOne of the adventuring bands that was chasing the bounty for the hag, appears to have found her a while back. Instead of killing her, however, they appear to have made a deal with her, and have used her foul magic for their own ends. They have finally been captured and dealt with, but we are no closer to finding the hag, and other adventurers have been less than understanding on the issue."
