 H84_watch_the_throne_title: "Watch the Throne"
 H84_watch_the_throne_desc: "What is there to say about orcs? Everyone could give you their own creative spin on the question, but for the Mountainshark Clan, one insult stands high above them all - slavers. For generations, orcs have enslaved goblins, and they've shown no signs of stopping anytime soon. With an entire clan of them now discovered in the old dwarf capital, we must prepare to act. Even if we don't go as far as killing them all, we can't just sit around and wait for them to put us in chains, either."
 H84_last_sons_of_glozok_title: "Last Sons of Glozok"
 H84_last_sons_of_glozok_desc: "We owe much to Glozok, the Great Shark. It was he who led many of our enslaved ancestors in revolt, at last giving them the chance to live free. It was he who founded our clan, which remains free to this day. And it has been his lessons of genius, cunning, and violence which have allowed us to survive and continue to live free, despite the orcs who want us enslaved and the dwarves who want us dead. We are the last remaining heirs to that great goblin's legacy, and we must not let his name and teachings die out."
 H84_shatter_the_crown_title: "Shatter the Crown"
 H84_shatter_the_crown_desc: "The slavers have been vanquished, and now we call the shots. We don't intend to enslave the enslavers, of course, but that doesn't mean they're going to get off easy. There's much loot and plunder to be had in this once great hold, and our new home of mithril could certainly use some expansion. It's not like orcs even know how to use this stuff anyway, right?"
 H84_the_new_colossus_title: "The New Colossus"
 H84_the_new_colossus_desc: "Word spreads fast among desperate goblins. Now that we've managed to establish a solid foundation in the Serpentspine, we've begun to see an influx of Voolkaru --goblin refugees-- coming into our territory. Many of these refugees are either escaped slaves, or from minor clans under threat of enslavement. Of course, any mass movement of goblins is bound to cause a little chaos, but we wouldn't have it any other way."
 H84_sharkbite_title: "Sharkbite"
 H84_sharkbite_desc: "If you want freedom, you have to fight for it.\n\nThat simple statement is the foundation of Glozok's lesson of violence. There's more to it, of course, but everything else follows from that fundamental point. Not only must we always be willing to fight for our freedom, but we must also be able to do it. Our current clanboss can always make a compelling demonstration of this lesson with good old-fashioned warfare."
 H84_truer_daggers_title: "Truer Daggers"
 H84_truer_daggers_desc: "Never let your enemy know what you're up to until it's too late.\n\nSuch is a good summary of Glozok's lesson of cunning. As slaves, it was always necessary to act with care and secrecy, lest any escape or revolt be crushed before it began. Even as free goblins, those tactics remain just as relevant and useful to us. What better way for our clanboss to demonstrate cunning than by outmaneuvering the assassins of the Truedagger clan?"
 H84_outskulked_title: "Outskulked"
 H84_outskulked_desc: "Do not try to be stronger than your enemy. Try to be smarter.\n\nFrom that simple truth, the rest of Glozok's lesson of genius springs forth. Goblins have always been small and frail compared to those around us, but Glozok taught us that it didn't matter. Cleverness and innovation could more than make up for any difference in size or strength.\n\nThe Railskulker clan fancies themselves as pretty clever goblins. Our clanboss could demonstrate the lesson of genius perfectly by outdoing them at their own game."
 H84_foundry_of_the_west_title: "Foundry of the West"
 H84_foundry_of_the_west_desc: "The old dwarf hold of Orlazam-az-dihr was once known to forge steel with such skill (and with so many rams pounding the metal) that it became known as its own material: Ramsteel. Even if the hold has likely fallen into disrepair, there's bound to be plenty of infrastructure left to use and repair. We're twice as clever as any dwarf, so surely we could handle the task ourselves. We just need to secure the hold first."
 H84_bootstrapping_the_forges_title: "Bootstrapping the Forges"
 H84_bootstrapping_the_forges_desc: "Our delving into the depths of Mithradhûm has paid off more than we anticipated. As it turns out, there's a good reason so much mithril is lying around here. The dwarves had forges made just for creating the stuff. We should be able to relight these bad boys and begin production once again. Who knows? Maybe one day we'll be able to do even better."
 H84_grant_scrap_commissions_title: "Grant Scrap Commissions"
 H84_grant_scrap_commissions_desc: "The old dwarven roads have long fallen into disrepair, but that doesn't mean they're worthless. In fact, there's enough scrap laying around that someone could make a decent living for themselves by collecting and selling it. Were we to sell rights to gather scrap along the roads to particularly enterprising goblins, we'd be able to make a tidy profit from the whole deal."
 H84_embrace_govrabliggin_title: "Embrace Govrabliggin"
 H84_embrace_govrabliggin_desc: "Glozok's lessons have always been important to us, but they've recently begun to take on new meaning. Where once they were meant to help goblins achieve freedom, we have expanded their scope to maintaining it. Now, goblins have begun to apply Glozok's teachings into their everyday lives, as well. His immortal wisdom is truly inspiring, and we should encourage the spread of it among our people."
 H84_goblin_diplomacy_title: "Goblin Diplomacy"
 H84_goblin_diplomacy_desc: "Our relationship with the Railskulkers is complex, to say the least. On the one hand, they're a clear rival to our power in the region, and they seem to think they're smarter than us. On the other hand, we have a lot in common, and our differences aren't impossible to reconcile. We should settle this once and for all. Are they our friends, or our enemies?"
 H84_teeth_and_steel_title: "Teeth and Steel"
 H84_teeth_and_steel_desc: "Now that we've gotten the old Ramsteel forges under our control, we should begin developing the area further. We may not be able to replicate Ramsteel just yet, but what we're making seems to suit war production nicely. Perhaps we could create a great armory here. Once we have a good industry going, we may even find avenues for expanding it."
 H84_demand_competence_title: "Demand Competence"
 H84_demand_competence_desc: "Perhaps we were a little too open to the Voolkaru at first. While we certainly hate to turn away any goblin longing to be free, there's only so much room in our capital, and we should reserve that space for the best and brightest. Glozok never said anything about charity, after all."
 H84_shark_fever_title: "Shark Fever"
 H84_shark_fever_desc: "As Glozok's lessons have taken firmer root in our society, we've noticed an interesting trend. Those goblins who have shown particular aptitude in emulating Glozok's teachings have risen to positions of high social status, both out of the inherent competence gained from emulating the Great Shark and out of respect from their peers. As lower status goblins have started to realize this, they've likewise rushed to try and properly learn and apply the teachings of Glozok themselves. Let's hope this is more than a passing fad."
 H84_first_among_goblins_title: "First Among Goblins"
 H84_first_among_goblins_desc: "We've come a long way from our time wandering the Serpentspine. Where once our clan was seen as foolish for committing ourselves to a dead goblin, we have now proven the superiority of Glozok's teachings. Now that we've proven ourselves to be the best, we should act like the best.\n\nThe Railskulkers should be the perfect start. Whether by force or persuasion, we will make them recognize us as their betters."
 H84_grandest_of_lines_title: "Grandest of Lines"
 H84_grandest_of_lines_desc: "Our production centers in Mithradhûm and Orlazam-az-dihr are humming along nicely, but there's still so much more we could do. All the production in the world is worthless if we can't get the results out to where it's needed. Fortunately, the new surplus of mithril should serve nicely in solving this problem. It'll take hard work and ingenuity, but if we apply ourselves, we'll be able to turn the old dwarven roads into grand lines of mithril, connecting our holds and our people in ways before thought impossible."
 H84_raise_the_alloy_shanties_title: "Raise the Alloy Shanties"
 H84_raise_the_alloy_shanties_desc: "The Voolkaru just keep coming. While unsurprising, it's also inconvenient. Or at least, it would be, if we didn't know exactly what to do with them. We always need more mithril, and the Voolkaru should be just as good at working as any other goblin. Entire villages will be converted to the task of forging mithril, and new Voolkaru will be more than welcome to join in. If they don't like it, they're free to leave at any time, of course. They're not slaves, after all."
 H84_meritokratic_kartels_title: "Meritokratic Kartels"
 H84_meritokratic_kartels_desc: "In an especially impressive display of cunning, some of our finest goblins have started banding together in order to preserve and enhance their wealth and power. Of course, our clanboss shouldn't be left out of the action. For a few concessions, we should be able to secure their loyalty, and get fabulously rich from the whole deal. Some decry this as corruption, but they're probably just jealous they hadn't thought of it first."
 H84_reign_of_a_shark_title: "Reign of a Shark"
 H84_reign_of_a_shark_desc: "Violence. Cunning. Genius. Our clanboss embodies all of that and more. Such a prestigious individual is rare in our society, and is often referred to as a Shark. Any such goblin would no doubt be on a fast track to success in our society normally, and receive immense respect and deference with it. Combining that with the status of clanboss, we can expect our people to be much more loyal and enthusiastic for a while."
 H84_powder_dry_fuses_lit_title: "Powder Dry, Fuses Lit"
 H84_powder_dry_fuses_lit_desc: "Now that the Railskulkers have been brought under us, new opportunities have presented themselves. We've always been highly industrious, and they've shown a penchant for innovativeness. In particular, we see potential in improving our cannons. We should bring the best and brightest of both clans together and apply them toward this task."
 H84_council_of_fire_title: "Council of Fire"
 H84_council_of_fire_desc: "Though the Kartels will always be a fine display of cunning, some have recently begun to specialize under the lesson of genius as well. These goblins show a keen mind for industry, always finding new and better ways to produce everything we need. We should organize these Kartels together into a special economic council, so that their talents might benefit our entire realm. Being worthy of Vortzo Liezmo himself, we shall dedicate this council in the name of Lord Fire."
 H84_council_of_thunder_title: "Council of Thunder"
 H84_council_of_thunder_desc: "Some of the Kartels, cunning as they are, have also shown specialization in the lesson of violence. So far, they've mostly spent their skills on protecting scattered communities of travelers from the many dangers of the Serpentspine. We can do them one better. By bringing these Kartels together into a special war council, we can utilize their unique skills toward defending and expanding our borders. Apzarko Hrom himself would surely be proud of their martial prowess, and we shall honor the Thunder Guard in turn by naming the council in his honor."
 H84_embers_of_the_great_shark_title: "Embers of the Great Shark"
 H84_embers_of_the_great_shark_desc: "From our humble roots, we have extended beyond all but the wildest dreams of any goblin. We have Glozok and his lessons to thank for that, of course. Through genius, cunning, and violence, we have managed to thrive, and can more than hold our own against any of the other residents of the Serpentspine. But we have not forgotten our origins, either. Glozok too started from nothing, and we now have a lead in Chainquarry regarding his remarkable story.\n\nWe should investigate further. Who knows what further wisdom of the Great Shark we might uncover?"
 H84_embers_of_the_great_shark_tt: "§GThe revelation of Glozok's legacy will unlock additional missions.§!"
 H84_troll_battered_mithril_title: "Troll-Battered Mithril"
 H84_troll_battered_mithril_desc: "In the old days, the dwarves of Orlazam-az-dihr managed to craft some of the highest quality steel in the Serpentspine, if not the world. They'd batter the steel with their rams during the forging process to accomplish this, apparently. Well, we know of creatures even stronger than their rams, and we should be able to employ them in the task of forging mithril to similar effects. Cave trolls may be ornery, but they'd surely be willing to work for us if some good food was in it for them."
 H84_explosion_of_industry_title: "Explosion of Industry"
 H84_explosion_of_industry_desc: "Where once we had but huddled, teeming masses of aimless goblins, we now have bustling and industrious settlements. The Voolkaru have more than proven their worth, turning the caverns around Mithradhûm into important industrial centers in their own right. With a bit more development, we'll be able to further harness their potential. Soon we'll have so much mithril, we may have trouble figuring out what to do with it all!"
 H84_break_the_chains_title: "Break the Chains"
 H84_break_the_chains_desc: "Haraz-Orldhum. There is no name that stirs the same mixture of hatred, anger, and pain in a goblin's heart. What little we have gleaned from our folk tales, we know more than enough. It was a den of corruption, slavery, and blood, the whip of the dwarven oppressors cracking on the backs of those unfortunate enough to be imprisoned there. The entire hold is a platinum-gilded monument to hatred and exploitation. It is only right that we take these products of the slavery of our forefathers and put them to better use, such as the development of our hold at Khugdihr, a forward operating-base for our state in Cannor. Let us use these products of evil for good! For Glozok!"
 H84_age_of_ambition_title: "Age of Ambition"
 H84_age_of_ambition_desc: "The further revelations concerning Glozok's first rebellion have struck our clan like lightning! Formerly but a flame in our goblins' hearts, it has been fueled further into a raging inferno, ready and rearing to spread the lessons of Glozok across the Serpentspine. Even the lowliest goblin works with the passion of Vortzo Liezmo himself! It is imperative that our clan spreads the great lessons of Glozok as far as possible!"
 H84_predatory_meritocracy_title: "Predatory Meritocracy"
 H84_predatory_meritocracy_desc: "An emphasis on freedom can be occasionally problematic. With renewed fervor in our ranks, the soldiers of our Violent army are ready to accuse each officer, their higher-ups, and even our Shark of acting like slave owners rather than liberators. Rather than conceding to their demands of elected army-officers and self-managed brigades, we shall give fervent ideologues their own place in the army. Rabble-Rouser Riflemen will be promoted towards the front-lines: this will let them destroy the enemies of Glozok, keep them from targeting our institutions, and give our troops valuable sources of inspirational propaganda!"
 H84_goblin_gourmands_title: "Goblin Gourmands"
 H84_goblin_gourmands_desc: "Serpentbloom and onion soup. Cavegrass bread with added garlic. Roasted bnunin-and-shimmerfruit skewers. Rothé patties, grilled and plated alongside firebud hearts. Each of these and more have become defining delicacies of a nascent Mountainshark cuisine.\n\nWith trolls employed in the Orlazam-az-dihr foundries, additional food must be secured to keep them sated and strong. As we increase our farms' productivity to meet this demand, our chefs have begun to experiment with all the foodstuffs we produce in the Serpentspine. Trolls may be the largest beneficiaries of this arrangement, but they are far from the only people who adore a state which gives them full bellies and food with flavor!\n\nTogether, our rising nation is defining for itself a unique culture of culinary development. Just as we innovate in technology, artificery, smithing, and currency, we innovate our food, too!"
 H84_beyond_past_or_present_title: "Beyond Past or Present"
 H84_beyond_past_or_present_desc: "Through their foundries and forges, the Geniuses already craft the mithril masterworks we cherish; through their expertise on creation, they have fully overtaken the Cunning on the boards of Lord Fire economic councils. The Geniuses are some of the best craftsmen in the world, and yet still they lack knowledge in so many domains: in philosophy, theoretics, artificing, and abstract principles, goblins remain behind the rest of Halann. Further, the secrets of Aul-Dwarov-- advanced rails, golems, and megaconstructions-- still escape us. This state of affairs must be rectified.\n\nWe shall hoard knowledge in Mithradhûm. We shall invite scholars from across the world and put them to work. We shall employ the best architects, hire the best teachers, and obtain the most modern books. We shall build a university in Mithradhûm, so that our Geniuses may emulate Glozok more faithfully than they ever have before!"
 H84_code_of_bribery_title: "Code of Bribery"
 H84_code_of_bribery_desc: "The faction of Cunning-- made of Kartel-bosses, merchants, bankers, and politicians-- has come to dominate our courthouses, law-rooms, and political offices. They are not a unified faction, though, as the rich can often obtain their wealth through simple inheritance or luck (much to the hatred of the rest of the Cunning, along with society at large). To limit the influence of Cunning-less wealth, the Genius economic councils have allied with parts of the Cunning to enact codes of limited, controlled bribery. Bribes will be controlled so that they do not get out of hand; they shall be limited (but not illegal) because a well-placed bribe is Cunning in itself, and should always be allowed. With oversight over bribes by both the Violent and Genius, the Cunning will be kept in line."
 H84_the_united_revolt_title: "The United Revolt"
 H84_the_united_revolt_desc: "Small bands of kobolds have greeted our kin with unusual friendliness. Our interactions with them all share a common thread, a deep gratefulness toward goblinkind for their part in a slave revolt many years ago. They speak of myths regarding a certain goblin, closer to dragonkind in viciousness and strength than they, who shattered their chains and slaughtered their masters. Though the records are shaky, their elders recall a great migration up from the south. In pursuit of Glozok's legacy, we must investigate this."
 H84_venerate_the_legends_title: "Venerate the Legends"
 H84_venerate_the_legends_desc: "The Cannorian faiths are strange, and most goblins find it incomprehensible why humans follow any of them. But with the spread of the Corinite religion to many orcs, we have started to take notice of a particular concept: that of the Avatar. The Cannor-faithful with consummate attunement to a particular god may embody that god so fully they become 'Avatars,' acting as conduits for divine will. Is this not how we should treat emulators of Glozok? Are the Violent, Cunning, and Genius not Avatars in their own ways? Perhaps we should adopt this concept, and venerate the Avatar-Emulants themselves…"
 H84_apex_guarentor_title: "Apex Guarentor"
 H84_apex_guarentor_desc: "Khugdihr was the heart of the Asra Bank's now-failed attempt to spread into the Serpentspine. The Bank has since been expelled, and we have 'inherited' their assets. Sharks have already reveled in the gold looted from Asra coffers, but now we realize that the dwarves held far more valuable resources: a well-maintained mint, and financial institutions which goblins had never previously heard of. Through translating their books, we learn the secrets of compound interest, fractional reserves, and a host of methods far better at extracting wealth than anything we currently employ. But there is one financial arena where we can outdo them, because we have something that they never did: mithril. By using (and expanding) their mint, we could create the most valuable currency in the world…"
 H84_suffrage_for_the_worthy_title: "Suffrage for the Worthy"
 H84_suffrage_for_the_worthy_desc: "Kartel-bosses have done much for the Mountainsharks, but their good reasoning has its limits. As we grow richer, the Kartels grow more corrupt; as they grow more corrupt, they become less attuned to the ideals of Glozok. To find the most effective emulators of the first Shark, then, we must expand the pool of potential voters to all competent members of goblinkind. Through them, we can find our greatest potential leaders.\n\nThis competency will be based on our three principles. Violence corresponds to army officers and decorated soldiers, as they serve the Sharks with valor; Genius corresponds to experienced artificers, artisans, and smiths, as they build our society to ever-greater extents; Cunning corresponds to wealth, as a wealthy goblin has proven their ability to thrive in a dangerous world. With our voter rolls extended to goblins of these three groups, we can ensure the choice of our leadership is in good hands."
 H84_subsume_the_nezkaru_title: "Subsume the Nezkaru"
 H84_subsume_the_nezkaru_desc: "For any cavern in the Serpentspine, a host of goblin families, or Nezkaru, claim rightful ownership of the land. These Nezkaru bicker and fight constantly, with each relying on tribal allegiances that have lasted for generations. The Nezkaru have always been kept divided by ruling dwarves and orcs, with some empowered and others diminished; then divided Nezkaru kept goblinkind divided, as tribes cut each other's throats for greater status in another nation's hierarchy. This shall continue no longer.\n\nThe Nezkaru shall be subsumed under Govzenszel governance. Across Mountainshark, our Cunning will run local courthouses, merchant-houses, and trade; our Violent will control local law enforcement and militias; our Geniuses will be placed in charge of local mines, forges, and workshops. Nezkaru will be allowed to continue as familial bonds and attachments, but not as legal or political entities. To liberate all goblins, our ties to un-Glozok tribes must be weakened."
 H84_favored_giantkin_title: "Favored Giantkin"
 H84_favored_giantkin_desc: "Trolls are great! They love our cooking, destroy our enemies, and smith our mithril. Many in their ranks happily follow the teachings of Glozok and see themselves as part of the liberated fold. We have already adapted our clan- and Govzenszel- structures to accommodate the trolls, and now we are given a further opportunity for us to help them (so that more of them may later help us).\n\nA particularly Cunning cave troll brings news of forest troll communities to the north. By inviting these northern trolls into the Serpent's Vale, we can bolster our armies, increase our smithing productivity rates, and bring even more trolls into the fold. Plus, since trolls are so much better than ogres-- damned corpse-eating barbarians, consuming their martyrs before they can be properly honored as heroes-- the more trolls we have in the Vale, the less the ogres will hold sway!"
 H84_commission_mega_works_title: "Commission Mega-Works"
 H84_commission_mega_works_desc: "Railways powered by fire-magic derived from lava-flows. Mining-bots based off of old dwarven golems. Forges capable of melting mithril as if it was copper. Foundries capable of shaping that mithril into forms that cannot be described with concepts we currently understand. Mints pumping out pure-mithril coinage to support our entire economy. Explosives like we've never seen. Explosive-resistant tunnel-supports like we've also never seen. Our artificers tell us that all of these and more can be ours, as long as we're willing to invest in them and their creations.\n\nThey tell us of Mega-Works, spanning each of Mithradhûm, Orlazam-az-dihr, and Khugdihr. They tell us of production targets we've never imagined, along with profits we have always imagined. They promise us riches, if we can get them smaller, more reasonable riches. How could we possibly resist?"
 H84_dancing_with_dragons_title: "Dancing with Dragons"
 H84_dancing_with_dragons_desc: "Though not quite brethren, goblins and kobolds share many traits with one another: we are both looked down upon simply for our diminutive nature, we both seek bountiful wealth even from the depths of poverty, and we share a common, sometimes literal, ignition of innovation. With these, we can find a common solidarity with them: a bond between small sharks and short dragons."
 H84_the_impossible_revolt_title: "Impossible Revolt"
 H84_the_impossible_revolt_desc: "We have heard rumors of a revolt which almost defies plausibility. Goblins often tell myths of successful uprisings in slave quarries-- where goblins were always surveilled, had no power, had nowhere to hide, and had no resources-- but these stories are usually seen as parables, rather than events that actually occurred. But now, we have found evidence of a successful Glozok-revolt in one of these very quarries. We must send an army to investigate this site, so that we may learn how Glozok's incredible Cunning managed such an impossible feat."
 H84_mega_foundry_title: "Mega-Foundry"
 H84_mega_foundry_desc: "We need to safely excavate huge portions of Orlazam-az-dihr so that we can craft a Mega-Foundry in its depths, but the tunnels of the hold have proven cumbersome to mine through. Thankfully, our military offers support. Who could possibly be better at navigating Serpentspine passageways (and blowing them up) than the Mountainshark artillerists: except for, perhaps, the generals they serve? With dozens of expeditions under their belt, tens of thousands of interlopers slain, and all of the most innovative ways to detonate bombs in hand, there is nothing they can't accomplish. Through military discipline and unrelenting manpower, we will ensure that Orlazam-az-dihr is ready to be exploited as effectively as possible!"
 H84_mega_forge_title: "Mega-Forge"
 H84_mega_forge_desc: "The dwarves invented a concept they call 'economy of scale.' Our engineers have developed a concept we call 'economy of try-a-million-things-and-see-what-sticks.' While the dwarves focused all of their energy on singular forges, singular farms, and singular mines, we have had the foresight to create a multitude of industrial centers all across our domain. If there was only one big forge, we wouldn't be able to experiment with all the ways we can make a forge better. But now, having built a thousand little forges all across Mithradhûm-- all working a little differently, with no two the exact same-- we can learn the best methods and practices from each. We'll put the best bits and bobs together, craft something glorious, and make the most efficient forge the Mithril-Home has ever seen!"
 H84_mega_mint_title: "Mega-Mint"
 H84_mega_mint_desc: "Gold is weak and pliable. Silver is soft and feeble. Both are deliciously shiny in their own right, but they are nothing in comparison to the one-and-only, maximally-glorious metal of all the world's dreams: mithril. Through Khugdihr, we have already brought euphoria to our merchants by providing them with currency made partially out of mithril. Now, with their help, we can do even more. If we can secure funding and mercantile support, we can grow our operations in Khugdihr to unprecedented heights. We can create currency not only mixed with or coated in mithril, but purely, unadulteratedly, made only of the perfect material. No currency in Halann will be as dazzling, nor as valuable."
 H84_hegemon_of_superiority_title: "Hegemon of Superiority"
 H84_hegemon_of_superiority_desc: "The world begs for our coin, cowers from our blade, and whispers about our power. We have mined, melted, and forged mithril with such mastery that we have come to dominate Halann's economy. Through our production of mithril and connections with international traders, we have become the hegemon not just of the Serpentspine, but also of industry and world trade!"
 H84_pinnacle_of_innovation_title: "Pinnacle of Innovation"
 H84_pinnacle_of_innovation_desc: "We have relit the forges of Mithradhûm, producing more mithril than the Serpentspine ever has before; we have founded the foundries of Orlazam-az-dihr, mass-producing mithril armaments that put every other smith in Halann to shame; and we have established mints in Khugdihr, selling pure mithril currency to the merchants of the world. The University of Mithradhûm features peerless scholars; industrial growth swells throughout our nation; literacy spreads like wildfire through goblin settlements. By using state-of-the-artificery inventions, the mastery of mithril, and the intelligence of every goblin under our rule, we have become the pinnacle of world innovation. It is now time to show the world just how smart we are!"
 H84_the_final_revolt_title: "The Final Revolt"
 H84_the_final_revolt_desc: "As we progress south, we begin to lose track of Glozok's rebellions. It seems his pace was slowed as the years went by: orcs became more wary of Glozok's tactics, and age rendered his body less capable of fighting forever. His trail has gone cold sooner than we hoped it would.\n\nTo remedy this, our Shark must personally oversee the search for Glozok's final revolt. If we can find his resting place, or any evidence of further uprisings, we can learn the fate of our Genius national father. There may only be one site left to find…"
 H84_shark_of_the_mountain_title: "Shark of the Mountain"
 H84_shark_of_the_mountain_desc: "In a parable recently written by a Mountainshark goblin and spread throughout our nation, it is written: 'And Glozok died, for there were no more slaves to free.' This work is apocryphal-- Glozok tragically passed when most goblins were still in chains-- but we, his heirs, have fulfilled his destiny. We have conquered the Serpentspine, freed the goblins, and brought prosperity to all. We have embodied Violence, Cunning, and Genius, and we have reached heights that even Glozok never could have imagined for goblinkind.\n\nWe are the Mountainsharks, and we have learned the lessons of Glozok. Now, it is time for us to write our own."

 mountainshark_events.1.t: "Violent Sharks"
 mountainshark_events.1.d: "In war, goblinkind has neither the physical strength of the orcs or the armaments of the dwarves. Instead, our means of victory is enshrined in Glozok's lesson of violence. As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] leads our armies through successful wars, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] learns-- and through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], we learn-- of how to embody Glozok's lesson of violence. Our enemies would see us returned to slavery, and we will have to fend them all off to obtain liberation for goblinkind. Our path of violent enlightenment starts here."
 mountainshark_events.1.a: "Through Glozok's teachings, we master the lesson of violence!"
 mountainshark_events.2.t: "Cunning Sharks"
 mountainshark_events.2.d: "The Truedaggers understand that it is not a goblin's job to fight fair. They do not, on the other hand, understand that the cause of all goblins is not furthered by constant backstabbing. Perhaps we shall teach them this lesson.\n\nOur goblins are led not just by base instincts, but also by the lessons of Glozok: and so they are not only more loyal, but also more cunning. Because of this, in the midst of the Truedagger's internal schemes, we have successfully challenged their self-declared mastery of subterfuge. Mountainsharks have bribed their members, spread clever misdirections, and infiltrated their ranks with our own. Using these agents, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] intends to make a personal statement to their clanboss about how the ideal of cunning means more than simple, small-minded, interpersonal schemes.\n\nWhat shall this statement look like? Shall we turn swords on the Truedaggers as they do upon each other, or simply reveal our spies and laugh at their foolishness? "

 mountainshark_events.3.t: "Genius Sharks"
 mountainshark_events.3.d: "Excavators dig at dwarven ruins, extracting and preserving whatever might seem unique. Smiths experiment with these scavenged relics, trying to understand how they work and what they do. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] oversees them, even taking part in the process: [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] suggests particular interpretations, argues over claims, and supports [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] premises with logic and reason. The smiths often find themselves in the awkward position of fiercely arguing against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes no offense. [Root.Monarch.GetName] tells them that genius is found in being right, not in being arrogant. It is smarter to learn what is correct than to imperiously insist on being wrong.\n\nThrough these meetings between artisans and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been able to advance our technological know-how considerably. Even the would-be technocrats of Railskulker fail to grasp our knowledge of the world, because we learn from the past, from the present, and from Glozok himself. We embody genius better than any other goblins could.\n\nAt the same time, Railskulker still has quite the expertise in many fields we do not. Many of their ranks would be interested in joining us and working alongside our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but there are two paths by which we can bring them into the fold. Do we want to poach Railskulker's best minds-- integrating them into Mountainshark entirely-- or do we want to officially collaborate with Railskulker, bringing both tribes together and aiding each of us in the pursuit of genius?"
 mountainshark_events.3.a: "Poach their best minds and put them to work!"
 mountainshark_events.3.b: "Why work against them when we can study together?"
 mountainshark_events.4.t: "The Unparalleled Forge"
 mountainshark_events.4.d: "Everywhere we can find them, we light the fires of Mithradhûm. The old forges of the hold are massive and dilapidated: they heave under the weight of thousands of years without use, rusty and decrepit with no one to care for them. The hold went dark long ago, and the orcs never had the talent to harness their industrial might.\n\nWe do not yet know how to purify mithril-- our early attempts have gone awry, with much of the raw ore either not changing at all in these nascent fires or burning up entirely and leaving nothing behind-- but we begin to experiment and understand. We find the old forges, get them running, and study how and why they work. We scavenge the hold for alloyed mithril, test their makeup, and see which alloys we can replicate and which we cannot. While the work is slow, we continually labor towards recreating the perfect metal.\n\nMithradhûm was once an unparalleled forge, and we will one day make it so again. Until then, we bring light to this hold. We warm our tunnels through colossal furnaces, and goblins cheer for our potential at these behemoth bonfires. The forges become meeting places and gathering halls, where goblins celebrate how far we have come and what we aspire to. The insignia of Glozok is painted onto each of them, and Mithradhûm becomes a symbol for the Mountainsharks. "

 mountainshark_events.5.t: "The Govrabliggin"
 mountainshark_events.5.d: "The Govrabliggin - the Shark Enlightenment - is upon us! All throughout Mountainshark, goblins begin to champion the causes of violence, cunning, and genius. Soldiers draw the geography of battlefields into dirt, sketching out their plans to enact maximally-effective violence. Traders enter into competitions of mock deals with one another, where both sides try to maximally swindle the other as to show off their cunning. Smiths and Kartel-workers collaborate on making bigger and better monuments to Glozok, straining their creativity so that they might embody genius.\n\nThese changes in culture spread far past individual pastimes. Slowly but surely, the army takes on a particular view of the violence they reap: one of liberating goblins, and of destroying their enemies. The rich of our nation adopt a philosophy of cunning: one where influence and wealth are the only ways goblins can thrive in a world that wants them subjugated. The artisans do everything they can to reach the title of genius: a title personified by creating bigger, better, and smarter inventions, inventions that can help all goblins become free.\n\nReverence for Glozok's lessons grows so great that the lessons become proper nouns in and of themselves. We are no longer a nation of violent, cunning geniuses; we are now a nation of the Violent, of the Cunning, and of Geniuses. Goblins from across Mountainshark sort themselves into these three categories, and our institutions begin to adopt one of the three as their philosophical purpose. We become more of Glozok's heirs every single day!"

 mountainshark_events.6.d: "Orlazam-az-dihr used to be a vital hold for war production-- it used to pump out weapons and armor of incredible might-- and they used rams, of all things, to create their famed ramsteel. It is certainly no surprise for the dwarves to find such commonality with the other hairy, stunted creatures of the world.\n\nWhile our current interests center on relighting the ancient foundries, ambitious artisans already scheme to recreate the secrets of ramsteel production. With our genius and craftiness, our metallurgy shall go far beyond what any dwarf with a farm animal can accomplish. We shall create a foundry here that will put old Orlazam-az-dihr to shame!"

 mountainshark_events.7.t: "Future of the Skulkers"
 mountainshark_events.7.d: "Railskulker, once the most powerful and crafty of all the goblin tribes, has stagnated. We, on the other hand, have expanded in all directions. This is all too natural, as we follow Glozok and they do not: and now it is time for them to come under our control, so that they might follow him too. We have allied Railskulker, supported them, surpassed them, and made sure they understand which tribe is now the greatest of the goblins. If we ask them to be under us, they will accept.\n\nAs we reach out to the Skulkers to demand their acceptance of our rule, we have a decision to make. Do we promise them autonomy in our warband, or demand full assimilation? Shall the Railskulkers exist as their own tribe under ours, or be fully transformed into Sharks?"

 mountainshark_events.8.t: "The Shark's Offer"
 mountainshark_events.8.d: "We have fallen under the sway of the Mountainsharks. Now, they demand that we submit ourselves further.\n\nTheir diplomats promise autonomy, at least in some respects. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will still retain power in Er-Natvir, and our technocrats will be treated well due to the Sharks' love of 'genius.' They demand much from us, but insist that goblins can only thrive in the Serpentspine when they are united under Glozok's heirs. While they applaud our genius, they say we have still yet to learn Glozok's lessons of violence and cunning.\n\nIs the deal they propose reasonable? Shall the Railskulkers become Mountainsharks?"

 mountainshark_events.8.b: "No one shall subjugate Railskulkers, not even other goblins!"
 mountainshark_events.9.t: "A Railside Chat"
 mountainshark_events.9.d: "Diplomats from Mountainshark - each a virtuous and Cunning follower of Glozok - loiter by the rails surrounding Er-Nativr. As Mountainshark has grown bigger, stronger, and more powerful than Railskulker, our diplomats expected quite the welcome: a feast, perhaps, or a tribute, or at least a poem celebrating Glozok. Instead, the diplomats wait in dank, cold tunnels for Railskulker emissaries who have decided to show up late.\n\nWhen the Skulkers finally arrive, the conversation is relatively simple. Our diplomats congratulate their fellow Rustroad goblins for their control over the rails, applaud the great things Railskulker has been able to do, and compliment their technocratic ways. They then speak of monetary concessions, potential autonomy within our warband, and ways for Genius technocrats to assimilate into our administration.\n\nIn response, the Railskulkers shoot our diplomats in the face."
 mountainshark_events.9.a: "They will pay dearly for their dishonor."
 mountainshark_events.10.t: "The Realm of Vorto Liezmo"
 mountainshark_events.10.d: "From across the Serpentspine-- from across the world-- goblins flood. Ex-slaves of orcs and dwarves and even humans and elves flee to us, and we welcome them with open arms. Or, at least, we welcome them to our territory with open arms. Entrance into Mithradhûm is a privilege that must be earned.\n\nA year ago, we cleared the caverns surrounding our capital, emptying them of all hazards so that they might be perfect for further development. Now, Voolkaru refugees inundate every inch of these caverns. Each of them is desperate to enter the shining city of mithril, and so they have built hundreds-- if not thousands-- of shanty-towns, all dedicated to the smithing of new alloys. Voolkaru organize themselves into teams of miners, smelters, and smiths; they experiment with materials, finding the cheapest and most productive metals to make; they construct towns that reach from the bottoms of caves to their ceilings, wherein every square meter has at least one goblin trying to be seen as violent, cunning, or a genius.\n\nThese alloy shanties are alive with energy, excitement, and fire. At least a quarter of them burn down every year, but this matters little due to the endless growth of Voolkaru and forges. The caverns are full of the name of Lord Fire, Vorto Liezmo, the patron of smithing, flames, and industry: they worship him as they praise Glozok, they cheer his name with every new innovation, and they sob his name when their new home burns down. The caverns become defined by fire."

 mountainshark_events.11.t: "Permanent Revolution"
 mountainshark_events.11.d: "The chant's call floods the streets: 'WE ARE NOT THE FIRST.' The response roars just as loud: 'WE ARE NOT THE ONLY!'\n\nThe tales of the original Shark clan spread like wildfire throughout Mountainshark. As masses of goblins march through the streets in a mix of celebrations and anger, the inadequacies of our current governance become clear. Though we have claimed Glozok's mantle, our leaders are not chosen for their emulation of Glozok. Though we say we rule through Violence, Cunning, and Genius, we are dominated by the same methods and institutions as any other goblin clan.\n\nOver the last few decades, though, our army has consolidated itself around the teachings of Violence. At the same time, our Kartel-bosses and merchants have embraced Cunning by dominating politics and governance. Simultaneously, the artisans, smiths, and craftsmen have come to champion Genius through managing the Lord Fire economic councils. As each faction solidifies power over a different aspect of society, the old Clan hierarchy falls apart. The beginning of something new is upon us.\n\nThe adherents of Glozok prepare themselves, win support from the people, and begin to dominate Mountainshark institutions. They spread the idea of a 'Govzenszel,' a Shark Republic, dominated by those who emulate the father of the nation. A new revolution is upon us, and it shall grow into a thousand other revolutions across the Serpentspine. As marching goblins swarm towards [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], they herald their arrival with a screech: 'ALL GOBLINS WILL SOON BE FREE!'"

 mountainshark_events.12.t: "Cousins of Inordinate Stature"
 mountainshark_events.12.d: "The Ramsteel hold, long ago, was the home of great forges that used the pure strength and endurance of dwarves to make the strongest alloys. Unfortunately, though we aim for superiority, a goblin can only achieve so much with their natural physique. On the other hand, we do know of those who bear strength and endurance greater than the dwarves, yet hold similar hearts and noses of goblinkind: the trolls.\n\nWith their raw muscles, willingness to serve, and loyalty to their craft, trolls have become renowned in every workspace they occupy. They form a reliable backbone for other workers in their small collectives, and they hold great potential for our foundries. Perhaps, by working with the trolls, we can replicate the lost art of Ramsteel production. Perhaps, together, we can usher in a new age of metallurgy through troll-battered mithril!"

 mountainshark_events.13.t: "Chains to Plowshares"
 mountainshark_events.13.d: "'I never thought I would see the day when I would walk the halls of Haraz Orldhûm as a free goblin. I was born here, in the dark and filthy slave pens, where our orcish slave drivers treated us as less than dirt. I grew up, working in the mines and forges where the only reward for a hard day's labor was a meager ration of food and a lash across the back.' - excerpt from 'Memoirs of Zarko.'\n\nOn the day of the liberation, a frenzy seized all goblins as they piled the slave-chains in the middle of Haraz Orldhûm. Wood, cloth, oil, explosives-- anything and everything flammable - was added on top and set ablaze in a fiery inferno. The spectacle lasted for days, as they watched the metals melt and burn, and cheered for the victory of freedom.\n\nWe have liberated this hold of slavers, and we have claimed their wealth and resources for ourselves. When the melted chains cooled off, we brought them back to the capital, where goblin craftsmen were eager to reforge the iron into tools for the newly freed workforce."
 mountainshark_events.13.a: "We salvage the chains we break! "
 mountainshark_events.14.t: "The Plundering of the Chain Hold"
 mountainshark_events.14.d: "Haraz Orldhûm was a prison of slavery and suffering for us, but also a treasure trove of rare metals. The most abundant of these was platinum, the iconic metal of the vain and the slavers. While we had no use for it, others did.\n\nDuring our expansion through the dwarven roads extending westward, we encountered another hold:  Khugdhir. Originally sieged and devastated by Korgus Dookanson, it was consequently restored by a dwarf organization called the Asra Bank that had subsidized a dwarven expedition to bring it immense wealth and riches. Following our recent acquisition of Khugdihr, the hold is now firmly in our control. The now-exiled Bank seems very interested in the treasures of our mountainous home: so much, in fact, that they are willing to pay exceedingly high prices for our riches. Several influential goblins have taken to our vast platinum supplies obtained during the sack of Haraz Orldhûm and have begun selling them to keen dwarven and human parties. But the humans had a smarter way of handling this business: banking. We should focus on restoring the infrastructure in Khugdhir and establish a banking institution with the platinum as initial capital for lending."

 mountainshark_events.15.t: "Legacy of the Violent"
 mountainshark_events.15.d: "With the guidance of the kobolds, we found what we were looking for in the darkness of the Underlair. The destroyed remains of an Orcish camp, so insignificant within the mountain, yet vital for our search.\n\nA hulking corpse lay crushed into the stones at the entrance, an iron crown forever impacted into his caved-in skull. The former warlord of this abandoned camp, most likely. Throughout the camp, cracked scales, broken teeth, and the remains of orcs, kobolds, and our kin. Among the orcs, adults and children, but among the kobolds and goblins, not one of them died without a weapon in hand. The only evidence of their lives and their great struggle, borne ceaselessly by the dark into the past.\n\nAt the end of the camp, we encountered the slave pens. Broken chains littered the floor, and old murals lined the cave walls. The murals depict a great beast, green in skin and large in ears, with a broken chain in one hand and the throat of an orcish slavedriver in the other. Surrounding him, a great host of jubilant kobolds and goblins, freed from their bondage.\n\nAwestruck, the literate members of the expedition document the finding, the rest draw crude approximations of the mural. Within the expedition, a debate rages as they prepare to return home. What lesson had the Great Shark imparted to us here?\n\nWe bury the slaves, the masters can rot."

 mountainshark_events.16.t: "The Undoubtable Bank"
 mountainshark_events.16.d: "In the tunnels of the Serpentspine, a thousand bits and baubles have been used by goblins as stores of value and mediums of exchange. Gold, silver, rubies, diamonds, sapphires, even particularly shiny (but otherwise normal) rocks: each has held their place as an object of goblin affection, and so each has been used as a currency in one form or another.\n\nBut in Khugdihr, we seized the Serpentspine branch of the Asra Bank. We found their glorious troves of golden coins, and we realized just how useful it was that all of them were uniform. If each of our baubles was made identical, we would never have to argue over how much any particular gilded nugget is worth. With standardization of currency, we can all collect shiny treasures more effectively-- and trade for them more effectively-- and sell them more effectively, too. In previous years, some might argue that it would be cruel to rubies to prioritize gold, or cruel to gold to prioritize silver, or any other combination of prioritizing one luxury resource over another. Now, though, this is no longer a concern. Now, the Mountainsharks have a resource unparalleled in value.\n\nWe shall begin minting 'Sharkskins,' coins made of gold and silver and coated in mithril. Minted in Khugdihr with the infrastructure the Asra Bank so dutifully left for their invaders, a single Sharkskin will be worth twelve Asra crowns. We do not yet have the mithril required to make our currency entirely out of mithril: but one day, we will. And when we do, all of Halann will desire our currency. Through the mints we shall construct in Khugdihr, the nations of the world will envy our riches just as goblins have always envied theirs."
 mountainshark_events.16.a: "We'll make our own bank, with mithril and goblins!"
 mountainshark_events.17.t: "Seeking the Trolls"
 mountainshark_events.17.d: "Forest trolls march towards the Vale! Though they live far in the north, and must pass through hostile ogre-filled lands to get to us, the promise of full bellies and freedom is not one they are willing to ignore. Every day, more forest trolls arrive: and when they do, we embrace them. We settle them in the Vale to displace the native ogres, or send them to Orlazam-az-dihr to work our foundries, or enlist them in our armies as soon as we can. While some are disgruntled that we choose where they settle, most had little concept of what our lands were like (and so do not greatly mind when we tell them where to go). We will teach them of Glozok, bring them into the Govzenszel, and become greater as a nation all the while.\n\nThe tenacity and strength of the trolls shall become a signature Mountainshark asset. We will work with them, and they will work with us. Through Glozok's lessons, even trolls can be sharks!"
 mountainshark_events.17.a: "A new homeland for them, a new labor force for us!"
 mountainshark_events.18.t: "Twin Histories"
 mountainshark_events.18.d: "Mountainshark was led to enlightenment by Glozok; the Darkscale kobolds were led to enlightenment by Nimrith. Though our father was not a dragon, he commanded the fierceness and cunning of one; though Nimrith was not Glozok, he was a father of a nation all the same.\n\nKobolds and goblins have always been similar creatures. We have both been despised for existing and subjugated by all of those around us. We have both been enslaved, and we have both killed our enslavers. We have both had to be Violent, Cunning, and Genius just to survive. Together, with our shared history, it is clear that we should work together.\n\nThis collaboration shall begin with a shared hoard of gold and mithril in Khugdihr. As we build this hold into ever-greater heights, it will be a hold for kobolds and goblins both! Glozok's lessons shall spread to the kobolds: they, too, shall be sharks!"
 mountainshark_events.18.a: "Together, we are unstoppable!"
 mountainshark_events.19.t: "Legacy of the Cunning"
 mountainshark_events.19.d: "All of Glozok's revolts would've been seen as impossible, had he not succeeded time and time again. Here in an isolated slave-quarry, though, his triumph almost doesn't make sense. The orcs had all the weapons and power; the goblins had nowhere to hide and no one on their side. How could even Glozok have accomplished such a feat?\n\nThe answer seems to lie not in Violence, nor Genius, but Cunning. Our army, sent to excavate, has found a tablet in the largest building of the quarry. Inscribed is a compact not just between the goblin slaves, but also - shockingly - between goblins and orcs! Glozok seems to have reached out to the lower-ranking orcs in the camp: he spoke to them about how they both suffered from meager rations and overly-harsh treatment, then agreed on shared demands and wrote them down on this tablet. Accordingly, some orcs may have supplied weaponry to the revolt. They may have even fought alongside them against their shared oppressors!\n\nThis finding is sending shockwaves throughout our army, but some - followers of Domination theory - claim that this tablet was just a trap. According to them, Glozok used the tablet to lure a huge portion of orcs into the meeting-hall, lulled them into a sense of security, and then slaughtered the orcs en masse. Then, they used this chaos to steal the dead orcs' weapons and storm the rest of the camp. As evidence, the Dominators point to the many orc- and goblin-skeletons found near the tablet.\n\nBoth theories are compelling, but only one can be true. What lesson do we take from this relic of Glozok? Was Glozok such a Mastermind that he could convince some orcs to fight alongside slaves, or such a Dominator that he could trick these orcs into an obvious death-trap?"
 mountainshark_events.19.a: "Glozok was such a Mastermind that even orcs were swayed!"
 mountainshark_events.19.b: "Glozok was such a Dominator that he could lure orcs to their doom!"
 mountainshark_events.20.t: "The Mega-Foundry"
 mountainshark_events.20.d: "In Orlazam-az-dihr, The Mega-Foundry is a constant cacophony of metal-molding music. Every part of the hold can hear trolls, rams, goblins, and artificed automata pounding mithril into shape.\n\nBullets easily pierce steel, and so smithing in most of Halann has progressed away from armor. The same cannot be said in Mountainshark, the nation of mithril mastery. Our armor - produced by masters, made for goblins, small and compact, and covering almost every part of our infantry - can blunt everything short of cannonfire. Our swords are just as strong, able to cut through anything weaker than a star-fort's walls. Our cannons are perfect, not made fully of mithril but rather alloyed with the material so as to maintain lightness and portability through mountainous terrain.\n\nThe strength of the Mega-Foundry lies not just in its mithril, but in its scale. Where most armies rely on individual artisans to produce their armor and weaponry, we have collected all the greatest smiths, munition-makers, and artillery-crafters into one location. We have given them every resource they could possibly desire and pay them handsomely for production on an insurmountable scale. The Geniuses have crafted machines and molds which produce thousands of bullets per batch; the Cunning experiment with materials and alloys, determining what is most economical for each implement; the Violent test it all, ensuring every production is up to par with Mountainshark standards. Our entire economy-- our entire society-- works together to produce an armory without rival. The Mega-Foundry feeds the nation with metallic might."
 mountainshark_events.20.a: "Mithril for war! Mithril for Mountainshark!"
 mountainshark_events.21.t: "The Mega-Forge"
 mountainshark_events.21.d: "When we found Mithradhûm, it was infested with slaving orcs. They mined in the hold's tunnels-- no, they forced goblins to mine in the hold's tunnels-- but they never discovered how to actually smelt what they harvested. The 'mithril' the orcs used for their armor was mostly raw ore: it was still durable and shiny, but it was never true mithril at all.\n\nSince those days, we have mastered the art and science of mithril. We learned that mithril can only be melted at incredible temperatures, so we pump lava from the depths of our holds towards the forges of Mithradhûm. We learned that mithril can only be extracted perfectly from its ore through earth-magic, so we produce artificer-extractors to automate the process for us. We learned that this magic works best when the mithril is exposed to particular combinations of minerals, so we sully the mithril-melting lava-flows of Mithradhûm with the exact reagents we need. We learned that mithril is easiest to smelt when great quantities are reduced all at once, so we mine from all over the Serpentspine, then send the raw ore to our Mega-Forge.\n\nAll the while, miniature forges sprout and spread across our realm. Not a single one of them will ever be as efficient nor as productive as the Mega-Forge: but through constant experimentation, we continue to perfect our process. Together, as a nation, we produce more mithril than Halann has ever seen. The dwarves which once saw us as nothing now envy our holds, and the orcs which once enslaved us drool at the thought of our weaponry. We have produced arms, armor, castles, coins, and cities of pure, unalloyed mithril: and our works grow greater every year. Through Mithradhûm, through the Mega-Forge, the apotheosis of Mithril Mountainshark is upon us!"

 mountainshark_events.22.t: "The Mega-Mint"
 mountainshark_events.22.d: "Pure, unalloyed mithril. We are making money out of pure, unalloyed mithril.\n\nWhen we crafted the first 'Sharkhearts' (that is, 100% mithril coinage), we didn't even know what to do with them. They were too valuable to trade for food, or pleasure, or any of the basic resources of life. It wasn't until Escanni and Cannorian and Plains traders came to our doors that we realized their truest worth: getting everyone else's currency into our hands.\n\nSharkhearts, it seems, are simply the greatest store of value in the world. The merchants who reach us understand this immediately, and are willing to trade for them at almost any cost. But their goods are almost never worth the coin, so instead they give us gigantic quantities of their own gold-and-silver currencies. Because of this, the entire economies of surrounding countries are beginning to be dominated by Sharkhearts: and not only Sharkhearts, but Sharkskins (our mithril-plated coins) and Sharkteeth (our mithril-alloyed coins), too. Coinage that costs almost nothing for us to make is being exported at extortionate rates, and yet international traders keep buying.\n\nNow, banks, financial institutions, and even governments come to us to buy our currency. Secondary markets are being set up in nations across Halann for the global rich to trade Sharkhearts, and these markets beg us for more. Khugdihr's Mega-Mint, newly-set-up and more glorious than ever, produces what is fastly-growing into the reserve currency of all Halann."

 mountainshark_events.25.d: "This is not just the site of Glozok's final revolt. This is the site of Glozok's grave.\n\nInscribed into a small, well-kept shrine, in the middle of an otherwise-abandoned tunnel, is the story of Glozok's last uprising. Glozok was old by the time it started, and knew that his body was weaker than it used to be; but he also knew that goblins were still in chains, and so he kept fighting. The eternal fight led him here, where he came across a small, inconsequential tribe. Glozok fought for them and alongside them: and while the revolt succeeded, Glozok was wounded. He was brought to safety by the goblins he liberated, and as he bled, the goblins asked him to speak of everything he knew.\n\nIt seems that Glozok spoke of everything in his Genius mind, for the shrine is covered in mathematics, history, philosophy, military theory, stories from his childhood, and more. There are scrolls, schematics, and even spell books sitting by the shrine's feet. Glozok died here - and he was buried here - but his incredible mind stays alive all the while. It lives on through the Genius knowledge he gave to the goblins he freed.\n\nThe small tribe saved by Glozok christened themselves Gravesharks, honoring his sacrifice by maintaining his grave. They now lead us here because they see us as worthy caretakers. As we come to understand this resting place (and vow to maintain it ourselves), we must decide how to interpret Glozok's final acts. Is his Genius embodied as the Clanfather, spreading knowledge and freedom wherever he went; or through the All-Knowing, understanding that which no other goblin possibly could? Do we emulate him through spreading knowledge to all, or through ensuring our leaders are well-learned and intellectual in ways the masses could never be?"

And Glozok was a Genius: he was a Clanfather who enlightened goblins across the Serpentspine, and an All-Knowing expert of every piece of knowledge in the world.\n\nOur Shark, [Root.Monarch.GetName], has embodied these values. We - the people of Mountainshark - have done just the same. Before our nation, before Glozok, we were merely slaves: now, we are the rulers of the entire Western Dwarovar. We have tricked our enemies, invented entire modes of living, and destroyed everyone who opposed us. We have liberated all goblins, enlightened them as we enlightened ourselves, and brought them into our system of rule. We have fulfilled every lesson imparted to us by Glozok, and further still, we have done more than he ever imagined. We have built mega-forges, mega-mints, and mega-foundries with more mithril than most thought existed in the whole Serpentspine! We have brought not just goblins, but also kobolds and trolls into the liberated fold! We have enacted reforms and built a state that even Glozok never envisioned!\n\nFor [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] contributions to our nation, our Shark shall be crowned a Great Shark, equal to Glozok himself. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will write new lessons, and we shall embody them with vigor. We will learn not just of Violence, but also Conquest; not just of Cunning, but of Conduct; not just of Genius, but also Creation! For our Great Shark, for the Great Mountainsharks, our story is not finished: rather, a new chapter begins!"

 mountainshark_events.27.d: "The only path forward is slaughter. Slaughter, and freedom.\n\nGoblins from across Mountainshark have embarked on a pilgrimage to engage in liberatory violence. By the time most arrive at their destination-- one of our new territories, wherein the primary industry (before our conquest) was the buying and selling of slaves-- the deed was already done. The slave owners have been whipped, broken, cut into pieces, and slashed a thousand times before they were allowed to die. Their homes have been burned to ashes. Their loved ones have been put to the blade or the firing wall. All histories of their tribes have been wiped from the records. Their relics have been smashed and their gods have been blasphemed. They are to be forgotten forever, and only those they enslaved will be allowed to tell their stories.\n\nThe Mountainsharks came from slaves, and we will tolerate not a single slaver within our country. Whether orc, dwarf, ogre, troll, human, or even goblin, we shall destroy everything the slavers have ever cherished. Not only will they be killed, but their entire cultures will be killed. There will be no chronicle of their existence except for the people we freed. No matter where or when we find them, our policy will be the same:"

 mountainshark_events.28.desc: "Glozokrats from across Mountainshark flock to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s term approaches its end. Traders, infantrymen, artificers, smiths, logisticians, Kartel-bosses, artillerists, craftsmen, bankers, officers, and bureaucrats - each heralding Violence, Cunning, or Genius - influence the proceedings through a host of their own maneuvers. The army vacillates between inspiring speeches about Liberation and wrathful threats of Destruction. The rich sometimes persuade and cajole as Masterminds, and sometimes blackmail and bribe as Dominators. The artisans often represent the Clanfather by advocating for all goblinkind, but just as often claim the title of All-Knowing, insisting that they are the only ones with the expertise required to run the nation effectively.

 mountainshark_events.30.title: "The First Mountainshark Election"
 mountainshark_events.30.desc: "The masses of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are calling [Root.Monarch.GetName] a slaver. After decades of politicking and finally obtaining mastery over the clan, it is this-- the discovery of Glozok's first rebellion, entirely out of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s control-- that finally threatens to bring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] knees. With news of the first revolution, thousands of goblins swarm the streets: each chants the name of a different proposed savior, each rants against a different despised problem, and yet each demands the same awful solution. They call not only for the death of [Root.Monarch.GetName], but the death of the entire clan hierarchy as it is currently constituted.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] allows the three delegates of the nascent rebellion into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] quarters. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had no other choice. The masses outside want to make themselves into a horde of Glozoks; these three, on the other hand, are willing to negotiate. The leaders claim to be the perfect representatives of Glozok's teachings: there is the general, representing Violence; the Kartel-boss, representing Cunning; and the mithrilwright smith, representing Genius. Each demands to be [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], yet only one can hold the position. If [Root.Monarch.GetName] can play these factions against each other, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] may manage to keep [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head.\n\nHow does the first 'election' of the Govzenszel - taking place entirely behind the closed doors of the [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] palace - play out? Who wins in this revolutionary coup?"
