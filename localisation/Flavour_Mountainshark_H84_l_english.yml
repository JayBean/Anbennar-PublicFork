The destroyed remains of an Orcish camp, so insignificant within the mountain, yet vital for our search.\n\nA hulking corpse lay crushed into the stones at the entrance, an iron crown forever impacted into his caved-in skull. The former warlord of this abandoned camp, most likely. Throughout the camp, cracked scales, broken teeth, and the remains of orcs, kobolds, and our kin. Among the orcs, adults and children, but among the kobolds and goblins, not one of them died without a weapon in hand. The only evidence of their lives and their great struggle, borne ceaselessly by the dark into the past.\n\nAt the end of the camp, we encountered the slave pens. Broken chains littered the floor, and old murals lined the cave walls. The murals depict a great beast, green in skin and large in ears, with a broken chain in one hand and the throat of an orcish slavedriver in the other. Surrounding him, a great host of jubilant kobolds and goblins, freed from their bondage.\n\nAwestruck, the literate members of the expedition document the finding, the rest draw crude approximations of the mural. Within the expedition, a debate rages as they prepare to return home. What lesson had the Great Shark imparted to us here?\n\nWe bury the slaves, the masters can rot."
