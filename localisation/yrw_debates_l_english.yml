 debate_1_topic_tt:0 "When the Ending Flood washed over the world, it was believed that the elves along the River were the chosen survivors to claim the aftermath. However, some wonder if it is only those elves who live along the main river who are chosen or also those along the smaller tributaries."
 debate_2_topic_tt:0 "The Ynnic Empire was the strongest and longest lasting realm to exist within the Ynn Valley. Even so, it fell and ever since debates have raged over the true cause. Some say it was because the military power emperors had would break the army into civil war upon their deaths. Others claim that it fell due to decadent aristocrats who fought more among themselves than against the empire's enemies."
 debate_3_topic_tt:0 "The arrival of the Cannorians has brought new and strange weapons to the battlefield. While a rifle lacks the grace of a bow, many have begun to stockpile this new device. The question now presents to us whether we should adopt these Cannorian guns for our own armies or if we should rely on the tactics that have served our people for centuries."
 debate_4_topic_tt:0 "It was recently believed that the Ynn River Valley was the fullest extent of the world and beyond the southern cliffs lay the Netherworld. However, these Cannorians have brought charts and maps from below the cliffs and much more. This has shaken the foundation of Ynn River Worship with clerics and commonfolk alike arguing over how these revelations should be interpreted."

It is said that [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s predecessors would hold speeches with a cup of wine in one hand and a dagger in the other, always ready to dispense one or the other. Today, a group far larger than what those monarchs of old were used to is assembled before [Root.Monarch.GetName], yet [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] feels none of that tension. Instead [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart is filled with hope and possibility for the future, and so [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] speaks:\n\n"Through tumultuous debates and radical protests, through bloody battles and tenuous peace, we have found ourselves at the quiet end of a challenging century. The known world has expanded farther than our ancestors could have imagined and here we stand at the forefront of a new era. Our faith has faced the difficulties of this changing world and we stand stronger in our resolve than ever before.

They now promise a quieter period where a Iosahar does not need to fear being assaulted over religious squabbles at any given feast. Now, we must ask ourselves to what extent we truly follow this new faith of theirs. Shall we join them in spreading the word of this new doctrine or shall we bide our time in an effort to claim a doctrine of our own?"

 YnnDebate10Bloc1_2:0 "The day’s festivities begin with a tourney. The joust is as popular as ever, skilled knights showcasing their ability with the saddle and the lance. This is followed by the general melee, where a variety of tactics are on display - heavily armored shield walls clash with pike formations popularized by Cannorian settlers.

It finishes with only one person mangled by stray javelins as they clean up the throwing range, which is seen as a sign of good luck by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].\nAs evening nears, food and refreshments are brought. The finest wild game is rapidly picked apart by the warriors who don't miss the opportunity to boast and brag about their feats in the most recent battles.\n\nThe feast brims with eagerness - when will the next war be?

They state that although the savages are not capable of civilization like true Ynnics of the former empire, that does not preclude them from grace. All life flows from the Ynn, and so all life is precious to its worship. Even common animals deserve some protection of which the Corrupted are no exception. Even more so as they are able to learn our language though crudely, and, though they foolishly worship animals spirits and runic inscriptions, this is only the misguided interpretation of our own zodiac and they can be saved from their beliefs."

According to them, it is only by the grace of the Ynn that our societies have flourished since the Ending Flood. The lack of any civilization among the Corrupted is thus proof they were never the chosen of the Ynn. Lords may entertain ideas of teaching them our ways, but they can never learn. One may teach a dog to do tricks, but the glorious works of Ynnic society are no mere tricks. We grow crops where they cannot. We have writing and a comprehensible language where they do not. We have culture where they do not. That is the disparity which they can never cross for they are the lost and we are the found."

But this night’s feast featured an exception: a rude interruption by one of our Cannorian Iosahar!\n\nLaughing as we discussed lance-thrust against spear-wall, they claimed a handful of musket-armed men would have been enough to defeat any of the legendary armies of the Ynn. It is outrageous, and the stir it has caused has certainly caused further escalation in our ongoing religious debate."

Meanwhile, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s battalion fought like an extension of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] will, driving each enemy before them and crushing all those that stood in our way.\n\nAlready, news of the tournament has spread throughout [Root.GetName], and stories of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s prowess are being sung in taverns across the land.

But it is not the loss on the field that smarts the most -- it is the way the story of the tournament has already spread across the land, with many in [Root.GetName] seeing it as strong evidence of the decentralized Iosahar system’s importance and value."
