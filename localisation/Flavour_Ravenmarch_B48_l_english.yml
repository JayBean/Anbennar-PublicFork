    flavor_ravenmarch.2.t:0 "Last of the Korbarids"
    flavor_ravenmarch.2.d:0 "Having traveled through the narrow pass along the Karnvrord river in the Godshield Mountains, our emmisaries find themselves in the dark forested hills of the Blackwoods. Once the Vertbern Basin was proudly populated by the Korbarid peoples, until their oppression under Castanor following Daravan's disaster forced them into poverty. By the occupation by the Phoenix Empire in the 11th century, only the Blackwoods remained proudly Korbarid. In these past four centuries, they have dwindled ever further, with their nobles being replaced by elvenized-Corvurians and their lands being squandered under oppressive feudal law. \n\nUs Ravenmarchers and Korbarids of the Blackwoods are kindred; our people are composed primarily of the same Korbarid people who instead persisted and endured in the mire-soaked Folly. So too have we endured hardships under the Corvurian crown and forced into bleak conditions. But now the Korbarids of the Ravenmarch have claimed a verdant land in which we are finally free to prosper! \n\nWe offer our cousins in the Blackwoods a hope for the future: we can ensure that they find peace in our state, free from Corvurian oppression. But the elders of the Korbarids disagree, having long been disillusioned by generations of hardship. They state that any such proclamation from us would only cause them more suffering, but that should we need it they may assist us by sabotaging Corvuria from within. The day comes to a close, and the secret summit with it."

A servant wearing a simple red mask, hands [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] a fine glass of Toarnen Black, before swiftly departing, leaving [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to survey the ballroom.\n\nSizing up the ballroom, three people catch [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s eye. Standing on the terrace, a man in a grinning Oni mask swirls his wine, alone but for his thoughts. Engaged in conversation, a woman in an ornate bird mask lightly laughs before starting to cross the floor. Near the front of the ballroom, a tall man in a fanged wolf mask cracks a joke, causing the people around him to chuckle before moving on, leaving him alone."

After a moment, he glances over, seeming surprised to see anyone.\n\n"Ah, good evening.", he says, dropping into a polite bow.\n\n"I was just admiring the way the light plays upon the rooftops. A pleasure to meet you. Tell me, do you know much about governance? I happen to manage many estates and keeping them all running smoothly is quite a task, why one time…" It’s clear that he intends to go on for some time."

    flavor_ravenmarch.6.t:0 "The Ornate Bird Mask"
    flavor_ravenmarch.6.d:0 "As you approach, the woman in the bird mask steps off the ballroom floor to a more quiet portion of the room. "Ah, delighted to meet you.", she says as she drops into a curtsy, "These affairs lose so much of their charm when there are no new faces, so I make sure to keep an ear out for fresh blood. Tell me, what are your thoughts on Escann? Many here view it as a backwater that we are lucky to have the Godshield preventing us from being associated with. Old money and power like them find any change distasteful, no matter what it is.""

    flavor_ravenmarch.7.d:0 "Eyeing you up as you approach, the man in the fanged wolf mask smirks and sweeps into a low bow. With a deep voice, he begins, "Greetings, stranger. Would you care to join me? I assure you that here only those of appropriate pedigree are allowed. The only commoners present know their place is beneath us, serving our drinks." He throws back his half-full glass of wine as a servant passes, before snatching another one out of their hands. "You simply have to keep them on their toes, so they know their place, wouldn’t you agree?""

    flavor_ravenmarch.8.d:0 "As you spend the evening in conversation, drinking wine, and dancing, [Root.Monarch.GetName] cannot help but notice that as the masquerade progresses, more and more people seem to be eyeing them. As a servant hands you another glass of Toarnen Black, a young man with a crimson and gold mask firmly bumps you from behind with their shoulder, almost causing [Root.Monarch.GetName] to spill the full glass.\n\n"It looks like the entertainment has arrived everyone!", the young man shouts, smirking, "Watch as a backwater provincial tries to blend in with real nobility! Tell me, does the far side of the Godshield have civilization, or is it just rabble emulating their betters and pretending they saved the world from something that couldn’t even leave Escann? You adventurers who went off to fight, tell me, did they teach you how to use a sword, or did they simply have you punch the orcs?""
    flavor_ravenmarch.8.a:0 "Shall I show you how we fight in [Root.Country.GetName], or are you too soft to duel?"
    flavor_ravenmarch.8.b:0 "Exchange a few retorts."

    flavor_ravenmarch.10.d:0 "The center of the ballroom floor clears, as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the offensive young man select blades from an attendant. [Root.Monarch.GetName] selects a simple, practical saber, with filigree on the handguard, while their opponent selects an ornate, engraved rapier.\n\nA murmur ripples through the attentive crowd as both take up dueling stances.\n\nThe young man unleashes a rapid barrage of thrusts and feints, pressing [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s guard, before dropping low and thrusting upwards. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] dives out of the way, landing in a roll and slashing as they rise. While the young man pivots to face [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the tip of the saber presses to his throat. The room is silent save for the sound of his sliced cape falling to the ground and his voice calling out.\n\n"Clearly I was misinformed about [Root.Country.GetAdjective] skill with a blade. I yield.""
    flavor_ravenmarch.10.a:0 "I accept your surrender."

    flavor_ravenmarch.12.t:0 "Blessing of the Faithful"
    flavor_ravenmarch.12.d:0 "In the weeks after the masquerade, word has spread of the chivalrous behavior of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Many clergymen and pious nobles have reached out with offers of assistance and public donations. Several sermons in the many steeples of Gablainé have highlighted how [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] embodies the might and honor of Corin, the grace of Ryala, and the keen judgment of Nerat. Should we accept their offers, our standing in the eyes of the faithful will surely rise."
    flavor_ravenmarch.12.a:0 "A ruler is nothing without faith."
    flavor_ravenmarch.12.b:0 "We do not need them."

    flavor_ravenmarch.13.t:0 "A Shadowy Boon"
    flavor_ravenmarch.13.d:0 "A gasp ripples through the crowd as the saber opens the impertinent duelist’s throat, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] tosses the sword to the ground with a clatter, before calmly spinning and walking through them to an empty balcony, shutting the door behind them. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] places their arms on the balcony and leans over the edge, from the side, a voice speaks.\n\n"That was quite an impressive display of swordsmanship. While many of us had our eyes on you and your nation, I feel confident in saying that with the… eagerness you dispatched that young lordling, many of us would be happy to lend you some assistance."\n\nGlancing around, [Root.Monarch.GetName] notices a man dressed in crimson formalwear who was not on the balcony a moment ago.\n\n"I represent a group of individuals who have been handling power with similar ruthlessness for far longer than most of those you left inside. We can offer your foundling nation many opportunities, provided your taste for blood extends to more than just ballroom dueling.""
    flavor_ravenmarch.13.a:0 "On behalf of [Root.Country.GetName], I accept."
    flavor_ravenmarch.13.b:0 "I see through your lies, begone!"

    flavor_ravenmarch.14.t:0 "Support Amongst the Masquerade"
    flavor_ravenmarch.14.d:0 "After the display at the masquerade ball, several nobles have spoken out about the treatment of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] at the gala. Some have donated portions of their wealth to the state, while others have offered to assist in other ways."
    flavor_ravenmarch.14.a:0 "At least some good came of that masquerade."

    flavor_ravenmarch.15.t:0 "Blessings of the Triumvirate Court"
    flavor_ravenmarch.15.d:0 "After closing shut the small door, your eyes slowly begin to adjust to the dim room. Three windows scatter light into the room: from the red shield and sword the strongest light of the noon sun shines, the intermediate from a heart with two rings with remnants of the morning sun, and the dimmest from a the set of scales that has yet to receive the evening glare. Situated where they converge is a simple pedestal and altar, displaying a thick book with a long red ribbon marking yesterday's readings. \n\nThis chapel of the Triumvirate Court has long been your favorite, situated in a forgotten corner of the palace, a far cry from the grand cathedrals of Vernham. But yet it is here you prefer to read and ponder, away from the bustle of the grand temple and responsibilities of court. Within the prayerbook are the traditional recountings of the gods of the Regent Court, along with the new writings of the heroine Corin protecting all of Cannor with her own life. The goddess Ryala features prevalently, a favorite of the Ravenmarchers since long before they left Dostanor. A noble lady and a gallant knight, a lowly maid and humble farmer; both virtuous and industrious, elope and utter their vows to each other, a comforting reminder of love to the suffering peoples. So too does Nerat, Judge of the Dead; All must wither and crumble into dust, but in his charge all are judged fairly on their actions in life. \n\nWhich of the Triumvirate deserves your praise? Ryala the Maiden of Love, Corin the Guardian, or Judge Nerat?"
    flavor_ravenmarch.15.a:0 "I shall invoke Ryala's Love."
    flavor_ravenmarch.15.b:0 "Corin's Might is needed."

    flavor_ravenmarch.16.d:0 "Piles upon piles of paperwork... petitions from irate subjects, marriage prospects, banquet invitations, demands from the electors... after a short rest you open the next envelope. Of late the curious emmisaries from the Ravenmarch have graced your court with their bold claims, and it seems that they are calling upon your favor today. They claim the lands of the Daravan's Folly, despite it being a putrid and worthless mire, and call for you to heed no call to assist the Imperial prince who squats upon it."
    flavor_ravenmarch.16.a:0 "A war over that useless swamp...?"

    flavor_ravenmarch.17.t:0 "A Dark Deal"
    flavor_ravenmarch.17.d:0 "It was not an easy decision to make, but for one ever burdened with rule, when has it ever been easy? Perhaps now we can have an end to the recent grief: our people can grow and prosper past the bloody past. The meeting place is a secure, but remote, facility. Arranged between seasoned veterans and zealous Carmine Judges of Nerat, you await this representative of the night with apprehension. \n\nAt last, an appearance is made. An entrancing pale lady, an imitation of a Corvurian noblewoman, strides through the door and charms the flanking guards with a disarmingly pleasant smile. \n\n'I come before you with a proposition, your grace' she says with a mocking curtsy. 'We have both had some trouble with my unruly cousins as of late. As you are well aware, the Masquerade of old seems to be rather defunct since you reclaimed your rightful titles. As someone who is influential among the families, perhaps we can rein them in together?' You find yourself absorbed in her words, and those fangs. 'They won't be happy about it, but the first step of our partnership,' she grasps your wrist with a cold hand, 'will require a not so small contribution on your part: Namely, they need some oversight. Your very serious judges here and their threatening executioners will do nicely. Just make sure they know their place.'"

    flavor_ravenmarch.18.d:0 "Uncovering the past beneath the years of swamp muck is an arduous task, but one that has been committed to zealously for the past few years. Searching for the buried civilization of Dostanor has so far been unremarkable, only uncovering stone foundations and the odd trinket. But today the excavators stand amazed, finding something truly remarkable: a sealed off chamber kept airtight by an enduring bronzen door."
    flavor_ravenmarch.18.a:0 "Let us see what treasures our ancestors have left us!"

    flavor_ravenmarch.19.t:0 "The Vernham Press"
    flavor_ravenmarch.19.d:0 "The city of Vernham has never been quite the same since the establishment of the press. While originally intended to publish information that we deem important for the public, the insolent printers have taken to producing illegal pamphlets behind the scenes. Not only do they disrespect our government and its policies, they are also pushing out the honest industries of the city. Most recently they have even claimed that our government has been repressing the free printers with vampiric assasins! The affected guildsman have petitioned your government to place heavy regulations on the printing industry, and arrest and prosecute the libel spreaders."
    flavor_ravenmarch.19.a:0 "Let them print what they want, with some minor edits."

    flavor_ravenmarch.20.d:0 "Enchanting rituals and transmutating rites have been cast day and night throughout Daravan's Folly, cleansing the soil, water, and air of the corrupted magic left behind long ago. Day by day the land has recuperated, with flora growing tall and fauna multiplying. Maybe even one day it will be possible for this land to prosper on its own without magical assistance. \n\nNatural scholars have studied the impact of our spells on the land, and have concluded that with some alterations of the ongoing rituals the land may be exploited. They have prepared a list of natural goods that may be possible to produce: clean salt from the brackish waters, sour but bearable wine, fur from estuarine rodents, and gargantuan mushrooms that thrive in the waterlogged mire."

    flavor_ravenmarch.21.d:0 "While the Ravenmarch has been governed from Old Vernham with great success, it's medieval facilities quickly becoming outdated and inefficient. And with our glorious reconquest of Dostanor, we find our possessions seperated into disparate regions. The newly reclaimed lands in the Folly remain the farthest from our governance, with New Corveld being the only center of civilization. In the tainted Vertbern Basin, the Order of the Ruby Scale struggles to fight the damned creatures of the night. \n\nIn these changing times, it may be best to establish a new capital to govern the newly reformed Dostanor. But we are torn between two different homes: one nostalgic of glory long buried in the marshes of Daravan's Folly, and the home we have established in Old Vernham. Gablainé, while being the heart of a Corvuria that was cruel to us, may serve the best chance to embolden our hold over the region and establish our Corinite faith throughout the region."

For generations you and your predecessors have awaited in this chamber for news from the Lady, always unsure if this would be your last day. You turn as a velvety darkness douses the pale moonlight, and replaces it with a heady perfumed vision. \n\n'I hope I haven't kept you waiting,' a fanged tooth glints, 'it would not do if you were to drop from exhaustion. You've not quite got the strength of your father. Say, I could do for a refreshment,' the Lady states as she saunters over to the upholstered chair and beckons towards a wine ewer. Despite the darkness of the room, her jet-black hair and elaborate gown is all but indistinguishable.'  \n\n'Well don't just stare, we've got some very important work to discuss! My little birds have twittered across many leagues: I'm sure they have gossip you might enjoy.' She hands you a scroll almost as pale as her hand. Is that ruby red stain from blood, or the wine she just spilled?

Old Vernham has truly transformed, with the open streets of our early reconstruction transitioning to tight and crowded alleys. But this could be to our advantage: the neighbouring borough of Vernham has room for a grand new city for the aristocracy.\n\nFirst on the list are their new residences, full of modern amenities and gardens. But not everything has to built anew: a small perfumery operating out of a temple to Ryala has become popular recently.

    ravenmarch_sway_bordermen_desc:0 "While our focus has been on seaborne trade, there is a not insignificant amount of trade conducted upstream of the tributaries to the Dostaneck. These lords of the Borders see themselves as protectors against eastern threats, us among them. But that has not stopped them from eagerly accepting our grain, timber, furs, and other raw materials they are lacking in. They must also begrudgingly ship their goods down the waters of the Dostaneck.\n\nPerhaps with a few negotiations, and some softly spoken whispers in the dark, we can renew our deals with the Bordermen in a fashion more favorable to the newly reforged Dostanor."

It is no surprise that the ports of the Straits are as prosperous as the metropolises of the Dameshead and the Gulf of Glass, if not more. From the Flooded Coast, our inland demesne has grasped at this bounteous trade as but an outsider. But our fleets grow strong, and our mercantile strength reaches new ports by the year.\n\nAs Dostanor reclaims its old possessions, battles barbaric gnolls and pirates, and defends itself against bullying navies, we have established ourselves throughout the Divenhal. It is time to assert ourselves as lords not of the Flooded Coast, but of a Gilded Sea."

No more are we the Raven Banner who drove the Greentide back, or the Ravenmarch who built a new home and reclaimed the old. We are Dostanor - from the Serpentspine to the Flooded Coast and beyond. Not just lowly peasants and desperate craftsmen, but multitudes of farmers who make bountiful what were once razed Escanni fields and manufacturers who build vibrant cities. We make our founders proud, reclaiming the Korbarid homeland once long lost, and defeating the evils that plagued it.'\n\nInscription outside the Bannerblade Manor at Vernham. Claiming descent from Arabella síl Kortir, the Bannerblade dynasty was one of the most successful landowning dynasties of the Ravenmarch. Their fortune came not from the usage or trade of slaves like other Escanni, but from the employment of Orcs, Half Orcs, and Goblins as freemen throughout South Castanor. The Bannerblade House constructed in 1754 as a gift to the young heir Valeran Bannerblade, and was soon seized by the state following his untimely death only a few decades later. The Korbarid style of construction inherits from the dark and moody style of classic Corvurian architecture, but elaborates it with ample balconies and skylights."

    ravenmarch_corins_peace_desc:0 "Another warm day on the Divenhal passes as the sun sets behind the Isle of Tef. From Brasan to Endralliande to Damescrown, the world's riches flow through these straits. In the reaches of Escann, fields resown provide food for a prospering Dostanor, carried downriver on the mighty Dostaneck. A once-downtrodden Corvuria is liberated from their corrupted monarchy, with Gablainé and Ravenhill producing fine artisanal goods under Nerat's safe embrace. Down the Dostaneck, the reclaimed lands from Daravan's Folly improve and prosper with each passing day. The lights of the newly-rebuilt city of Corveld shine upon the waters of the dockyards, and in the grand halls of the Korbarid manors feasts are dedicated to each victory.\n\nSome call this 'Corin's Peace,' with much of the Divenhal under the protection of Dostanor. While conflict is perpetual in the borderlands of Bulwar, the Salahad, and with the envious Empire of Anbennar, few can disagree with the wealth and power of the Dostanorian Sea. Few also understand the cost of this 'peace.'\n\nMay Nerat forgive us for our dark dealings..."

For centuries they have believed that Surael is the only living god, and that the worship of the Regent Court falls on dead ears. While Castellos may be dead, we know for truth that our gods are real - for how much more real can they be than Corin rising from death, only to ascend to godhood upon slaying Korgus Dookanson?\n\nThe Bulwari may simply be hesitant to learn of this truth.
