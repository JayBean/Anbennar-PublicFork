 # Allclan Mission Events
 allclan.1.t:0 "Choose our Focus" #Used for allclan.1-4
 allclan.1.d:0 "From humble beginnings skulking in shadowed caverns, our clan has prospered. We have created a uniquely goblin Serpentspine, an Allclan for all goblins.\n Without the looming threat of extinction, the various factions of our clan have begun to squabble amongst themselves for dominance. If we don't show clear support for one or another, our union may fail before it even begins.\n\n The machinists and weaponsmiths have formed a union of technocrats known as the Zukovinkraty. They advocate for supremacy through innovation and invention. \n\n The once disparate clanbosses and their cronies have banded together to reform the horde into a functional and efficient state, capable of matching the direct control displayed by the great empires of the world. They call themselves the Fubaristi.\n\n One can never discount the clan in shadows, the Kartelklanovi. The cartels have a strong grasp on all monetary ventures of the clans, and have become a formidable force in the political arena. \n As the unifier of the Allclan, our choice may well tip the balance. Which faction deserves our support?"
 allclan.1.a:0 "Laud the Technocrats."
 allclan.1.b:0 "It was bold leadership that brought us here."
 allclan.1.c:0 "The cartels provided the cash to make this happen."
 
 allclan.5.t:0 "The Dwarven Decision"
 allclan.5.d:0 "Dwarves are hardy, diligient workers. They are also profoundly stubborn, and demonstrate an intense hatred of all goblins. They may eventually make for good slave labour, but keeping them around may be more trouble than its worth."
 allclan.5.a:0 "Purge them."
 allclan.5.b:0 "Put them in ghettos."
 allclan.6.t:0 "The Orcish Inquiry"
 allclan.6.d:0 "We have a long history with the orcs. In ancient days we would struggle side by side against dwarven oppression. The mountains still hold vast numbers of orcs, and they will be a valuable resource if we can pacify them. That being said, the tensions inflicted by the Greentide run deep, and there are factions demanding vengeance for their treatment of goblinkind. By any means necessary"
 allclan.6.a:0 "Purge them."
 allclan.6.b:0 "Send them to the ghettos."
 allclan.7.t:0 "The Kobold Quandary"
 allclan.7.d:0 "Kobolds are an interesting lot. They tend to be a nuisance if left unmanaged; stealing gold from the clan's banks, laying traps on otherwise mundane corridors, and generally being pests. However, we do recognize that many in the world would consider us goblins in a similar light. If we can tolerate their strange ways, the Allclan could expand to incorporate the kobolds. If not, well.. they will not be missed."
 allclan.7.a:0 "Purge them."
 allclan.7.b:0 "Treat them as second-class citizens."
 allclan.8.t:0 "A Role for the Kobolds"
 allclan.8.d:0 "Kobolds thrive on purpose. If we can reprogram that purpose away from hoarding gold to something more productive, it will benefit everyone involved."#
 allclan.8.a:0 "Send them to be lab assistants."
 allclan.8.b:0 "Their muscle will make them good bailiffs."
 allclan.8.c:0 "They can contribute with a tail tax."
 allclan.9.t:0 "The Kobolds Spread"
 allclan.9.d:0 "With their new role secured, there is now little to no tension between goblin and kobold. Throughout our nation tribes of kobolds are settling into goblin communities and improving productivity."
 allclan.9.a:0 "This is good for the goblins (and the kobolds, I suppose)"

 allclan.10.t:0 "Council Debate: How to Move the Orcs to the New Farms"
 allclan.10.d:0 "The Nezkaru council has called a special assembly to deal with the newest item of policy. It is a remarkably calm one, with only two bombings and a poisoning that have disturbed the proceedings so far. The issue currently under debate in the council is that of the orcs, specifically how best to move them to the new farms we have prepared.\n\nThe debate, as it always does, has coalesced into three policies supported by one of the major political factions.\n\nThe Zukovinkraty position is that the process offers an excellent opportunity to test the latest inventions and give our military some practice. Their plan might take longer, but offers to make the enterprise serve a dual prupose.\n\nThe Fubaristi plan is to simply force the orcs to move the old fashioned way. They claim it will be both swift, cheap, and nationally important to allow the goblin masses to push the orcs out as a united effort. No doubt a ploy to win themselves some influence with some of the easier fooled masses, but a workable and likely swift suggestion.\n\nFinally, the Kartelklanovi see this as another opportunity to make money. They claim that the council can encourage various cartels to put their own money into the whole affair by offering farm production futures and land allotments to goblins for sale, meaning more money all around. The hidden impact of their plan is that we will likely make more money selling them once the orcish labor is in place, but the impact might not be so much."
 allclan.10.a:0 "Sounds like a perfect opportunity to test some new weapons!"
 allclan.10.b:0 "Orcs respect strength right? Why not show them some."
 allclan.10.c:0 "Why not just solve it with money? We have some generous donations lined up."

 allclan.11.t:0 "The Project is Complete"
 allclan.11.d:0 "Orcs handled."
 allclan.11.a:0 "We made the right choice."
 
 allclan.12.t:0 "Council Debate: Showing the Dwarves their Place"

 allclan.12.c:0 "Use their greed against them."
 
 allclan.13.d:0 "Dwarves handled."
 
 allclan.14.t:0 "A Demand to the Tree of Stone"
 allclan.14.d:0 "We make a simple demand of the Undergrowth Dens; aknowledge our right to rule, or prepare for war."
 allclan.15.t:0 "An Envoy to the Triarchy"
 allclan.15.d:0 "An ambassador has been sent to act as cultural envoy to the Triarchy. With any luck, they will be able to establish a knowledge sharing initiative with the Triarchy. The secrets of Aelentir will be ours!"
 allclan.15.a:0 "Reach out for some idea exchange"
 
 allclan.16.t:0 "What to Do With our Guns?"
 allclan.16.d:0 "Guns are great. Really! But now, gnomes have guns, and soon the whole world! How can we make our guns the best guns to ever gun?"
 allclan.16.a:0 "I like big guns I can't deny"
 allclan.16.b:0 "What if they shot... bombs?"
 allclan.16.c:0 "What if we put knives on them?"

 allclan.18.t:0 "A Demand of the Deepwoods"
 allclan.18.d:0 "Scouts have been sent throughout the Deepwoods to spread the message to the forest clans; the Allclan offers protection. Failure to accept this offer will be taken as an act of rebellion." 
 allclan.18.a:0 "Demand tribute."

 allclan.20.d:0 "A lucrative offer has been sent to the exodus clans. In exchange for access to their trade networks and agriculture the armies of the Allclan will provide defence in times of war. They would be wise to consider this offer carefully." 

 allclan.21.t:0 "Election Reform"
 allclan.21.d:0 ""
 allclan.21.a:0 "Consolidate voting, to leave more time for tinkering."
