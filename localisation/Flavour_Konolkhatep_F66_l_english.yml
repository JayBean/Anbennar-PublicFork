 flavor_konolkhatep.1.d:0 "Our rule over the lands of Kheterata is almost unquestioned; we have the full support of the godlike beings known as the Khet and gnollish armies march the length and breadth of the Sorrow.\n\nThough we hold the blessing of the Khet to rule, the religious politics of the humans we rule over are somewhat more complex. Though all worship the Khet, there are two major factions within the Khetist faith. If we are to legitimise our rule in the eyes of our human subjects, we should choose one of these factions to support.\n\nThe Elikhetist faithful are the most established within the Kheteratan heartland and among the urban elite. Adopting Elikhetism would ensure our popularity among the nobility in the capital, but given its more orthodox nature they may not respect us as outsiders.\n\nOn the other hand the Nirakhetist faith is popular among the lower classes and among the province's on the edge of Kheterata. Championing Nirakhetism may legitimise our rule and give us a way to gain popular support, but may also cause unrest in the heartlands."
