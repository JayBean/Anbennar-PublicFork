 #First Column
 #All of the Brelari Missions, that is the next 3, should be written in a way that portrays the Brelari as beneath the rest of the Ynn due to their democratic-not-feudal leaning ways, and this is something that needs to be rooted out and replaced by proper feudalism.
 seize_the_iron_houses_title:0 "Seize the Iron Houses"
 seize_the_iron_houses_desc:0 "The mission to conquer Brelari, for two reasons: They border the cursed ones, which it is our duty to protect the Ynn from, and the brelari hills are full of iron, something Amacimst always needs more of."
 order_in_the_mountains_title:0 "Order in the Mountains"
 order_in_the_mountains_desc:0 "This mission turns them into a monarchy, turning loyal village leaders into hereditary lords and removing disloyal ones replaced by proper Dolindhans."
 establish_planatorl_title:0 "Establish Planatorl"
 establish_planatorl_desc:0 "Planatorl stands for Mountain Fort in Dolindhan. Established both for keeping the Brelari in check, and guarding the Brelari highlands against cursed ones. You can make up a character who becomes the leader of said keep if you'd like to mention here."
 establish_the_ear_bounty_title:0 "Establish the Ear Bounty"
 establish_the_ear_bounty_desc:0 "See the Amacimst idea about adventurers, they constantly go into the forest for loot and fame. Amacimst instead will direct them to kill cursed ones for a regular bounty, they can redeem the ears for coin in Vitresoln, which as a result is growing steadily."
 punitive_expeditions_title:0 "Punitive Expeditions"
 punitive_expeditions_desc:0 "Sending adventurers and defending our villages isn't enough, we need to do large scale raids into the forest to cleanse the nearby lands of any threat, and make sure they don't get close to our lands."
 kill_them_all_title:0 "Kill them All"
 kill_them_all_desc:0 "The organized expeditions are having positive effects, so Amacimst should do it more. "
 the_half_humans_too_title:0 "The Half-Humans Too"
 the_half_humans_too_desc:0 "Freemarches, a nation of half orcs, comes into the FotCO as well. Amacimst just seems them as weird cursed ones, and gives them the same faith."
 were_done_here_title:0 "We're Done here"
 were_done_here_desc:0 "Should be a joyous description; it seems that the forests surrounding Amacimst are finally save from cursed ones, so instead the order will be repurposed to guard the state from other threats, as well as keep the Ynn save from outsider ideas."
 #Second Column
 building_for_the_future_title:0 "Building for the Future"
 building_for_the_future_desc:0 "Vareynn was the OG capital of the Ynn, and while once grand, has been in decline every since the fall of the empire. Vareynn Amac (Vareynn Keep) is already more important. Amacimst aims to use the stones of Vareynn and repurpose them to reinforce and expand their keeps that defend the FotCO border. Might want to tie in that Amacimst is in favor of the rural traditionalist life rather than city life."
 enhance_our_keeps_title:0 "Enhance Our Keeps"
 enhance_our_keeps_desc:0 "Higher towers, larger stables, stronger walls, better equipped garrisons to protect the border against the cursed ones in Vitresoln and Amacimst."
 great_ranches_title:0 "Great Ranches"
 great_ranches_desc:0 "The finest knights of the Ynn require the finest horses, so amacismt will aim to create great ranches aimed soley at breeding the finest antler horses exlusively for the Amethyst order."
 cloaks_and_barding_title:0 "Cloaks and Barding"
 cloaks_and_barding_desc:0 "See their idea about the cloaks, Amethyst knights love showing off, which the cloaks and barding that are bright purple are important for. This mission is about improving the industry that makes them in Amacimst, importing experts from Lukaustra and Stanirhalas (nearby cloth provinces), and investing in brighter dyes to show off."
 enchanted_cloaks_title:0 "Enchanted Cloaks"
 enchanted_cloaks_desc:0 "Looking dashing in purple isn't enough, so the Amethyst order will hire mages to enchant all knight's cloaks and barding to better protect them from the mighty blows of cursed ones"
 telekenetic_knights_title:0 "Telekenetic Knights"
 telekenetic_knights_desc:0 "Any magic user in the Amethyst order is trained to use Telekenisis to help them in combat. Things like acrobatics, jumping off their horse mid charge for an increased killing blow, just cool acrobatic knights with magic basically."
 the_western_keeps_title:0 "The Western Keeps"
 the_western_keeps_desc:0 "While Amacimst has always protected the east from cursed ones, the western keeps have done the same to protect the Ynn from the Epednar tribes. Naturally, we are better than the locals so Amacimst seizes the keeps and makes them into Amethyst order strongholds."

 flavour_amacimst.0.t:0 "Protectors of Dolindha"
 flavour_amacimst.0.d:0 "Amacimst, Castle of the East. This is the name that protected Dolindha ever since the fall of the Ynnic Empire in 1205. Alongside it stood Amaceped, Castle of the West. The lords of the two castles ruled in peace and magnanimity until the Great Heathen Army of the Rzentur attacked.\n\nThe battle of Lisicalrevo saw the heathens repelled by the valour of Ynnic Knights, but Amaceped fell soon, treacherously assaulted by the brutes of Malacnar. Alone, Amacimst began its decline, losing its allies and vassals in a series of betrayals.\n\nAmacimst's current Lord, Gelendirn Sivasred, is known for his idleness in all affairs of state that do not involve writing long letters or attending plays, but out there in the fields Gelendirn's son already rallies the knights, promising he will wage war for as long as enemies remain on the Ynn."
 flavour_amacimst.0.a:0 "We shall reclaim our glory."
 
 flavour_amacimst.1.t:0 "Moving against Gelendirn"
 flavour_amacimst.1.d:0 "On the outskirts of Vitresoln, where Dolindhan serfs meet Cursed One raiders, a valiant knight's protection is appreciated more than anywhere else. This, and other thoughts, go through Faraji's mind as he wipes the blood off his armour and takes off his helm. He looks at the knights surrounding him: they would follow him into the darkest recessess of the Forest if he led them, yet they deserve so much better.\n\nHis father, Gelendirn, was a soft person who, if questioned about his rule, was capable of talking and talking and talking... and never taking action for the good of the realm, content to let its many traitors and enemies lurk in the shadows. It was as if he... he wanted this! If this was true, then it was a sacred duty for Faraji to depose him like the corrupt tyrant he was. But what would the people think of him, a prince raising his arms against his father? Faraji gripped the hilt of his sword, then dropped it on the table.\n\nAfter all... didn't King Komerjon slay his father, before making ancient Vareynn into the greatest kingdom the Ynn had ever seen?"
