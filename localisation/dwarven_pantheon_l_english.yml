 dwarven_pantheon_no_target:0 "Since there are no eligible targets for our §DMajor Deity's§! effect, we will gain the following:"

 dwarven_pantheon.1.t:0 "Father of Mountains"
 dwarven_pantheon.1.d:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace is quiet today, even as a massive crowd has gathered to observe the ceremony about to occur.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] emerges, but there is no cheering. Silence is paramount. The first cart of alcohol is brought forth, followed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], without a word and aided by several priests of Dagrin, who taps the first massive barrel that stands at least 15 feet tall and is branded with the symbol of Dagrin. A rough line forms, each participant possessing a mug. The drinks will be passed out for the entire day, here in [Root.Capital.GetName] and across the country, as the blessed Dagrin's Drink is distributed by the priesthood of Dagrin."
 dwarven_pantheon.1.a:0 "Bottom's up! Respectfully, of course."

 dwarven_pantheon.2.t:0 "Mistress of Justice"
 dwarven_pantheon.2.d:0 "The hammer falls as the corrupt captain follows his fellow conspiring magistrate into the Halls of the Dead, where Dagrin will certainly ensure that they suffer for their corruption and misuse of power. This is the third execution held by the priesthood of Anvelind in [Root.Capital.GetName] in a week, as all across the realm similar trials are being held that have been authorised by [Root.Monarch.GetName]. These are to be overseen by Anvelind's clergy in an effort to assist in resolving the rampant revolts and unrest throughout the country. "
 dwarven_pantheon.2.a:0 "Hammer time."

 dwarven_pantheon.3.t:0 "Carver of Caverns"
 dwarven_pantheon.3.d:0 "A heavily equipped priest of Durvorazir hefts the pickaxe and strikes the wall, watching the rock crumble away. The rubble falls, and a cold rush of wind blasts forth as the stale air of the isolated cavern is cycled for the first time in perhaps millennia. Another promising location to expand the industry is discovered thanks to the efforts of the priests of Durvorazir in exploring and excavating brand new caverns. Elsewhere across the country similar efforts are being done as good-faith measures by various temples to the Mason-God in an effort to expand stone production. Good granite is godly granite, after all."
 dwarven_pantheon.3.a:0 "I was thinking of new counters.."

 dwarven_pantheon.4.t:0 "Purifier of the Body"
 dwarven_pantheon.4.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] sniffs the concoction offered by the High Priest of Margurz. The scent of alcohol masks the worst offending smells, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] still retches at the odour. "Are you sure," they ask, "that I need to consume this?"\n\nThe High Priest nods. "It is an essential part of the ritual. You must consume it, then count backwards from 100." The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] reluctantly takes the concoction and starts doing so, falling unconscious by 93. "Excellent!" cries the High Priest as he turns to a nearby acolyte. "You! Fetch me the saw. We have nine hours, according to the texts, before he wakes up."\n\nA day later, despite having a splitting headache and a shaved head, [Root.Monarch.GetName] says that they have never felt better."
 dwarven_pantheon.4.a:0 "Though why do I smell burnt bread?"

 dwarven_pantheon.5.t:0 "Delver of the Deeps"
 dwarven_pantheon.5.d:0 "The priest of Miradeth lowers her head, ducking under the low ceiling and holding her torch high, looking at the scene before her. The twisted passage smelt of danger, of death, but also of fortune and riches. The map recovered was true, and she had proven it. "We can head back now," she turned to her companions behind her. "We've confirmed it's here."\n\n A few days later the missive to [Root.Monarch.GetName] arrived by hand of a priest of Miradeth, containing a confirmed report of a new expedition site."
 dwarven_pantheon.5.d2:0 "The priest of Miradeth lowers his head, as he tosses the bottle into the hole, watching it vanish into the darkness. Five. Ten. Fifteen seconds pass before the sound of glass echoes out of the hole. Then, he turns to the crowd, raising his head as he speaks, "I consecrate this mine in the name of Miradeth Earthseeker, and may the bounty it bring be plentiful and rich!" The crowd roars, the sound's echoes being heard for miles as all celebrate with the fulfilment of the blessing. "
 dwarven_pantheon.5.a:0 "Ready an Expedition!"
 dwarven_pantheon.5.b:0 "Strike the Earth!"

 dwarven_pantheon.6.t:0 "God of the Forge"
 dwarven_pantheon.6.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] woke up to the blaring of horns and the clanging of anvils, which was confusing, considering that the nearest forge was far from their bedchambers. Outside the palace grounds, a procession arrived bearing a banner with the symbol of Azmirethazin. Along with them were wagons filled to the brim with armour and armaments, as a variety of smiths worked even then to ensure every piece of equipment was up to standard. There was enough equipment to arm four regiments of infantry, at the very least, and enough dwarves following the procession to equip them; each volunteer eager to wear such fine work, and willing to waive recruitment fees to boot."
 dwarven_pantheon.6.a:0 "What are we waiting for? Sign them up!"

 dwarven_pantheon.7.t:0 "Slayer of Monsters"
 dwarven_pantheon.7.d:0 "The rural landscape is quiet as a steel-clad priest of Argezenna stalks the darkness. He is just one of many, seeking out the monsters in the dark that still dwell in the places beyond the civilised light of [Root.Country.GetName]. His task is holy, and the fetid rot he spots ahead in a ramshackle encampment is his next target. He nods to the soldiers on his left and right, and they light their torches and draw their weapons.\n\nThese creatures chose to hide like rats, so they will die like rats."
 dwarven_pantheon.7.a:0 "Sickness must be purged."


 dwarven_pantheon.8.t:0 "Organiser of the Gods"
 dwarven_pantheon.8.d:0 "The tired clerk hefts up another stack of papers and begins sorting through it, uttering a prayer to Auirikus as he does so. The audit of our country's excavation budget was well underway, and this was the last stack to go through. As he sorts through the papers, he spots a discrepancy, followed by several more. By the time the information reaches [Root.Monarch.GetName], the full story is clear: several high-ranking individuals had been skimming off the top in several key locations. The priesthood of Auirikus has offered to assist in further examinations for a marginal fee. While costly, it would undoubtedly free up an immense amount of resources for the hold's excavations, and perhaps even allow us to go after these corrupt individuals."
 dwarven_pantheon.8.a:0 "Holds don't dig themselves."
 dwarven_pantheon.8.b:0 "§T[auirikus_target1.GetName]§!"
 dwarven_pantheon.8.c:0 "§T[auirikus_target2.GetName]§!"
 dwarven_pantheon.8.e:0 "§T[auirikus_target3.GetName]§!"
 dwarven_pantheon.8.f:0 "§T[auirikus_target4.GetName]§!"
 dwarven_pantheon.8.g:0 "§T[auirikus_target5.GetName]§!"

 dwarven_pantheon.9.t:0 "Lord of Runes"
 dwarven_pantheon.9.d:0 "A delegation of rune-priests from Urisazirn arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] today, bringing with them carts loaded with magical artefacts and runeworks of their own creation. They presented a few pieces and books as gifts to [Root.Monarch.GetName], while the rest were sold to various nobles, mage guilds, and independent practitioners to assist the church's coffers. This mass distribution of magical items will undoubtedly reinforce the influence of our country's spellcasters for the foreseeable future, or at least until the objects are inevitably lost or damaged due to misuse or misfortune."
 dwarven_pantheon.9.a:0 "We will put these to good use."


 ###deity discovery events
 dwarven_pantheon.30.t:0 "Dagrin Everbeard"
 dwarven_pantheon.30.d:0 "Dagrin Everbeard, the Father of Mountains, the First Mason, and countless other titles, was the first dwarf. Halanna, the goddess of creation, made him in the cavern of Earthseed, where he assisted her in carving out the first subterranean chambers beneath the roots of stone. He remains the paragon of all dwarven kings, ruling their realms with paternal care, wisdom, and justice. Though venerated as the first ancestor in Ancestor Worship, in the ancient Dwarven Pantheon he was also the patriarch of a vast clan of gods, many of whom we are sure to rediscover in time…"
 dwarven_pantheon.30.a:0 "Our Father, Remembered at Last."

 dwarven_pantheon.31.t:0 "Anvelind Hearthmaiden"
 dwarven_pantheon.31.d:0 "Sculpted from pure elemental essence, intended to be Dagrin's equal and partner when Halanna had realised that one individual alone could not sculpt the world itself. Anvelind is the divine matron, it is she who judges the gods and keeps order in their court. Traditionally her priests are lawmakers and judges, who seek to model her justice in Dagrin's Halls, under the earth."
 dwarven_pantheon.31.a:0 "Our Mother, Hearth Rekindled"

 dwarven_pantheon.32.t:0 "Durvorazir Everbeard"
 dwarven_pantheon.32.d:0 "First son of Dagrin and Anvelind, Durvorazir mastered the art of hewing stone into block and brick by his tenth year, and in his efforts to adorn and expand the halls of his father's home, carved numerous great caverns in a hunger for mastery of his craft, demanding nothing but perfection of himself in his chosen craft."
 dwarven_pantheon.32.a:0 "First Mason, Chisel Carved."

 dwarven_pantheon.33.t:0 "Margurz Brewmaster"
 dwarven_pantheon.33.d:0 "Second son of Dagrin and Anvelind, Margurz was enamoured with the creatures and plants of the wilderness that had been made by the Travellers and the Primordials. Seeking ways to use those found above and beneath the earth, Margurz would earn the title Master of Ale and Herbs by discovering the process of fermentation, and creating the first culinary and alcoholic wonders of Dwarvenkind, as well as discovering the medical properties of herbs and alcohol as consequence of his earlier enlightenments."
 dwarven_pantheon.33.a:0 "First Brewer, Glasses High!"

 dwarven_pantheon.34.t:0 "Miradeth Earthseeker"
 dwarven_pantheon.34.d:0 "First daughter of Dagrin and Anvelind, Miradeth grew up in awe of her brother's wonders and sought to aid him in any way possible. For this, she sought her uncle Azmirethazin's assistance, and he provided her with the first tool designed not to shape stone but to break it. With pickaxe in hand, she carved out great caverns in the earth, piling the rubble high to form the first true mountains. She fed the metal bounty unearthed from the debris to Azmirethazin's forge and left the stone for Durvorazir to work with as he pleased."
 dwarven_pantheon.34.a:0 "First Miner, Strike the Earth!"

 dwarven_pantheon.35.t:0 "Azmirethazin Forgetender"
 dwarven_pantheon.35.d:0 "Brother of Dagrin and made from a different stone by Halanna, Azmirethazin is the patron of all smiths and metalworkers. He is also known to dispense his sister Anvelind's justice, wielding his mighty forging hammer, Mae'nalenlier. His crafts are known to be unparalleled, although some say that the items crafted by his grand-nephew, Urisazirn, rival or even surpass his quality."
 dwarven_pantheon.35.a:0 "First Smith, Forge Rekindled"

 dwarven_pantheon.36.t:0 "Lady Argezenna"
 dwarven_pantheon.36.d:0 "Azmirethazin's first creation in his forge was Argezenna, forged of Magnetite, Bone Ash, and Az. She was the one who taught Azmirethazin the secrets of the forge and together they travelled the world to collect the materials necessary to create a forge of their own, worthy of the gods. It was during this journey that she became known as the Slayer of Monsters and Steel Guardian for her valiant efforts in protecting Azmirethazin, including slaying an elder wyrm to steal its flame and fuel their forge. Over the course of their journey, the two fell in love and would work in tandem in Dagrin's Halls."
 dwarven_pantheon.36.a:0 "First Slayer, Blade Reforged."

 dwarven_pantheon.37.t:0 "Auirikus, Hand of Dagrin"
 dwarven_pantheon.37.d:0 "Once a mortal dwarf during the later Era of Forging, Auirikus ascended to divinity after Dagrin had determined that his domain was growing too large for him to manage by himself. Seeking a wise and competent manager, Dagrin chose Auirikus as his steward to ensure that everything within his realm occurred as it should, and all tasks were carried out both to the letter and the spirit. Auirikus fulfilled his duties, striking fear into the hearts of those who were found lacking in their efforts and rejecting shoddy or incomplete work as a disgrace to Dagrin. Those who excelled at their tasks received rewards and praise in abundance."
 dwarven_pantheon.37.a:0 "First Steward, Critiques Recalled."

 dwarven_pantheon.38.t:0 "Urisazirn Mithrilhand"
 dwarven_pantheon.38.d:0 "First son of Durvorazir, Urisazirn did not possess the same strength as his father and grandfather, but his mind was keener than even the sharpest blade forged by Azmirethazin's hand. He valued knowledge and wisdom, and consulted with Halanna often. In the early days, disputes between Giants and Dragons would leave Dwarves trampled underfoot, and whilst Steel and Mithril aided in throwing back both, it was not enough. Seeing this, he developed a way to channel the latent magic within the earth itself, channelling it into a form of language that could harness the magic in a Dwarf's stead. This was the first Runework, and the history of Dwarven civilization was forever changed afterward."
 dwarven_pantheon.38.a:0 "First Runesmith, Memory Restored"

 dwarven_pantheon.39.t:0 "Dolurazan Ironhand"
 dwarven_pantheon.39.d:0 "Only son of Azmirethazin and Argezenna, Dolurazan was taught mastery over the black metals such as iron, wrought and cast, steel, adamantine, and titanium. In time, he created the arms and armour of the gods and their servants in the Era of War. During the Giantbreak Wars, one of his arms was severed by a Fire Giant kin when he was captured. His mother, Derzobrazan, freed him from captivity and forged a new arm as a replacement. Dolurazan is seen as the patron of all blacksmiths, and many of our smiths now keep small shrines to him in their forges."
 dwarven_pantheon.39.a:0 "Smith, the iron's hot"

 dwarven_pantheon.40.t:0 "Derzobrazan Goldenhair"
 dwarven_pantheon.40.d:0 "Daughter of Azmirethazin and Argezenna, Derzobrazan was taught mastery over all noble metals, such as platinum, silver, gold, and all others, including Mithril. She made the jewellery of the gods, and her works were sung in praise and legend by many. Even the Giants and Dragons would entreat her with her masterpieces. Though one foul wyrm kidnapped her during the Era of Desolation, they were struck down by Dagrin himself, and the silver beast's hide became the cloak she is often associated with. Derzobrazan is the patron of all noble smiths, and silver statues of her likeness adorn many jeweller or whitesmith guild halls."
 dwarven_pantheon.40.a:0 "Mithril's Mistress!"

 dwarven_pantheon.41.t:0 "Bervinazan Bronzeheart"
 dwarven_pantheon.41.d:0 "Bervinazan, the second daughter of Azmirethazin and Argezenna, was taught the mastery of all basic metals, such as copper, tin, lead, pewter, bronze, brass, and others of their kind. Her artistry skills were unmatched, and she could create lifelike or even living statues from the metals and alloys of her domain. Her creations served as magnificent guards, and during the Era of Diminishing, when Setzovar's Children attempted to steal the precious metals of the earth, it was her artworks that prevented them from inhabiting what would become the King's Rock. She is revered as the patron of all common smiths, and her likeness can often be found in statues or sculptures in their guildhalls."
 dwarven_pantheon.41.a:0 "Brilliant Brass and Bronze…"

 dwarven_pantheon.42.t:0 "Karazlov Mountaincaller"
 dwarven_pantheon.42.d:0 "Karazlov was originally a common dwarf with a gift for speech and song. His performance was so enchanting that it captured the hearts of the Divines, who rewarded him with divinity under Dagrin. He was sent out to the world beyond the mountain homes to act as Dagrin's eyes and ears. Karazlov became the ambassador for Dagrin and negotiated treaties and trades with distant relations, such as the Giants and the spawn of Aesanna and Setzovar, the Dragons. He played a crucial role in negotiating the peace at the end of the Giantbreak Wars. Diplomats from our society now travel with his symbol on their person, as it is believed to provide an extra edge during negotiations."
 dwarven_pantheon.42.a:0 "Once more we call the Mountaincaller."

 dwarven_pantheon.43.t:0 "Grimthar Woodcarver"
 dwarven_pantheon.43.d:0 "When the first trees emerged, it was Grimthar who peered from the mountain halls and saw their worth. He traversed the newly emerging forests, teaching himself to shape and carve them into intricate forms and learning their uses. He even taught Margurz which parts of the trees could be turned into alcohol, and created barrels for him to better ferment and impart new and interesting flavours to his creations. Due to Margurz's petition and his own skill, Grimthar was awarded divinity and became close friends with Margurz. Today, many of our brewers keep a small shrine dedicated to him in their brewhalls to instil a spirit of camaraderie in their distilling."
 dwarven_pantheon.43.a:0 "Hew the Oak to brew the Oat!"

 dwarven_pantheon.44.t:0 "Verdrik Azirkra"
 dwarven_pantheon.44.d:0 "Second son of Durvorazir, Verdrik was not like his more scholarly brother. He was focused on the practical and physical aspects of life. He turned stone into blocks and transformed blocks into buildings. For him, art was the cold practicality of the stone he laid, expressed in arches and fortress walls. He specialised in engineering, constructing bridges that arched over chasms and roadways that were laid through caverns. It was said that he was the personal patron of Hehogrim the Diligent and inspired him to create Hehodovar. Nevertheless, many builders of ancient Hehodovar would dedicate their works to his name, even though his priesthood elsewhere would be less than pleased by some of the liberties taken."
 dwarven_pantheon.44.a:0 "A well reviewed bridge is godly."

 dwarven_pantheon.45.t:0 "Thyrfen Goldenhands"
 dwarven_pantheon.45.d:0 "An ancient queen of Amldihr, from before the reign of Aul-Dwarov, Thyrfen Goldenhands is said to be the one who first began the grand feat of engineering that turned the Serpent's Vale into the bountiful farmland that would, in time, allow Amldihr to forge the Empire of Aul-Dwarov. Pious and devout to the gods, she took no husband and sired no children, even as her hold grew fruitful and rich from the grains of the Vale. Just as her reign was reaching its apex, it is said that Margurz himself took her as his wife, coming down from Dagrin's Halls and whisking her away in front of her entire court."
 dwarven_pantheon.45.a:0 "Glory be to Goldenhands!"

 dwarven_pantheon.46.t:0 "Werdûn Diamondeye"
 dwarven_pantheon.46.d:0 "Originally a jeweller from ancient Ovdal Lodhum, Werdûn Diamondeye was challenged by his peers to cut a gemstone that would captivate the gods with his craft. After a long and gruelling journey through the Tree of Stone and back, he returned to Ovdal Lodhum and presented a cut garnet to his peers. They told him that its match was in the possession of Dezobrazan herself. After making this declaration, he vanished, and the temple in Ovdal Lodhum dedicated to her contained a new mosaic depicting the wedding of Werdûn and Dezobrazan. As the patron of courtship and love, many young dwarves sought his blessing for happy marriages."
 dwarven_pantheon.46.a:0 "Love is Eternal."

 dwarven_pantheon.47.t:0 "Lorgrim Farstrider"
 dwarven_pantheon.47.d:0 "One day, Lorgrim Farstrider appeared fully divine, heralding the end of the Era of Forging alongside her brother Lorgram. When Death entered the world, she gathered the souls of Dwarvenkind, while Dagrin stood stupefied as the oldest of his people suddenly grew weak and perished from the monster known as Age and Sickness."
 dwarven_pantheon.47.a:0 "Stride far, Farstrider."

 dwarven_pantheon.48.t:0 "Lorgram Deathkeeper"
 dwarven_pantheon.48.d:0 "Appearing fully divine one day, Lorgram Deathkeeper's arrival heralded the end of the Era of Forging alongside his sister, Lorgram. When he appeared, he began to ensure that the souls of the dead were taken into Dagrin's halls and organised according to their skills and virtues in life. Here, in the deeper reaches, he acts as the keeper and custodian, ensuring that the dead are rewarded or punished accordingly."
 dwarven_pantheon.48.a:0 "May we be found worthy."

 dwarven_pantheon.49.t:0 "Grobilazk the Twisted"
 dwarven_pantheon.49.d:0 "Grobilazk is a remnant of a previous age, a time when the Void invaded Creation. When the Void retreated, Grobilazk remained behind. However, Grobilazk was a cowardly creature and despised its masters. It was caught in the purifying blast of the Primordials when they purified the Travellers of the Void, and as a result, was anchored to this world. It strove to keep a low profile, so as not to attract the attention of the seven beings who ruled over Creation. When the Seven began to create races in their own image, Grobilazk followed suit and created the first goblinoids. As a result, the dwarven race has been plagued by these beings throughout history."
 dwarven_pantheon.49.a:0 "I don't like this one."

 dwarven_pantheon.100.t:0 "The Old Gods"
 dwarven_pantheon.100.d:0 "As our reclamation of the Dwarovar continues, we come across more and more symbols, works, and temples dedicated to the ancient Dwarven Pantheon. This has led to a spike in interest in such objects and places by many individuals. To those interested, the purpose is purely scholarly. Indeed, a few individuals have after suffering what can only be described as profound experiences, saying they feel closer than ever to their ancient history.\n\nWhilst some Stonekeepers say this is the beginning of a serious spiritual degradation, many others are unconcerned by the actions of a few fools and scholars "
 dwarven_pantheon.100.a:0 "The bickering of fools is not our concern."

 dwarven_pantheon.101.t:0 "Stones to be Kept"
 dwarven_pantheon.101.d:0 "What began with a handful of scholars and a smattering of voices has grown into a consistent murmur. As our reclamation continues, many Stonekeepers are up in arms as one of their own has officially broken ranks and begun to delve into studies involving the old Pantheon, after discovering a partially legible tome concerning the gods and their relation with our people."
 dwarven_pantheon.101.a:0 "Perhaps I could get a copy?"
 dwarven_pantheon.101.b:0 "They abandoned us. Cease. This. Now."

 dwarven_pantheon.102.t:0 "Old and New"
 dwarven_pantheon.102.d:0 "Long ago, during the time of Aul-Dwarov, our ancestors worshipped the ancient Pantheon which consisted of many gods. However, when Aul-Dwarov fell, our ancestors believed that the gods had abandoned them and subsequently gave up their faith. But as we continue to reclaim our ancestral home, there are those who wish to revive the old faith, despite the objections of the Stonekeepers. They propose that perhaps it was our ancestors who abandoned the gods instead. The Stonekeepers demand that we authorise the burning of these individuals who are considered heretics for such blasphemy. We cannot avoid taking a side any longer. Action must be taken."
 dwarven_pantheon.102.a:0 "Perhaps we did abandon them…"
 dwarven_pantheon.102.tooltip:0 "We will start the process of rediscovering the Dwarven Pantheon"
 dwarven_pantheon.102.b:0 "If they will not recant, they will burn."


 dwarven_pantheon.103.t:0 "Dagrin Everbeard"
 dwarven_pantheon.103.d:0 "Dagrin Everbeard was the chief god of the old Pantheon. As we begin to piece together his story from archaic tomes, desiccated scrolls, and abandoned temples, a certain fervour has gripped a group of adventurers who have offered their services to delve into the abandoned ruins of a great temple dedicated to Dagrin ahead of more sanctioned groups, in an effort to hasten our progress. All that is required is our authorization to do so."
 dwarven_pantheon.103.a:0 "We must know more. Let them search."
 dwarven_pantheon.103.b:0 "We do this properly, or not at all."

 dwarven_pantheon.104.t:0 "Dwarf or God"
 dwarven_pantheon.104.d:0 "The nature of Dagrin Everbeard has been a contested subject. He is the model every dwarven king aspires to be: wise, just, and ruling with paternal instinct over their entire realm. Although in Ancestor Worship, he is lauded as the first ancestor, in the old Pantheon, he was also the patriarch of a vast clan of other gods, whom we are sure to rediscover in time. Interestingly enough, both views place him as the first creation of Halanna the Earth Mother, the primordial of Earth, and her favoured child. This still begs the question: is he really a god or merely a favoured progenitor?"
 dwarven_pantheon.104.a:0 "A god, of course!"
 dwarven_pantheon.104.b:0 "We should debate this carefully…"

 dwarven_pantheon.105.t:0 "Thyrfen Goldenhands"
 dwarven_pantheon.105.d:0 "We have recovered a complete ritual and prayer book dedicated to one of the gods! An ancient queen of Amldihr, Thyrfen Goldenhands, from before the reign of Aul-Dwarov, was said to be the one who first began the grand feat of engineering that turned the Serpent's Vale into the bountiful farmland that would, in time, allow Amldihr to forge the Empire of Aul-Dwarov. Pious and devout to the gods herself, she took no husband and sired no children, even as her hold grew fruitful and rich from the grains of the Vale. Just as her reign was reaching its apex, it is said that Margurz himself, likely another god, took her as his wife, emerging from Dagrin's Halls and whisking her away in front of her entire court."
 dwarven_pantheon.105.a:0 "We must know more."
 dwarven_pantheon.105.b:0 "Steady now, let's not be hasty."

 dwarven_pantheon.106.t:0 "Anvelind Hearthmaiden"
 dwarven_pantheon.106.d:0 "After much effort, we have gathered enough information to gain insight into another god. Anvelind Hearthmaiden was sculpted from pure elemental essence and intended to be the equal and partner of Dagrin when Halanna realised that one individual, no matter how mighty, could not shape the world alone. In the old Pantheon, Anvelind is regarded as the divine matriarch, and it is she who judges the gods and maintains order in their court. Her priests are traditionally lawmakers and judges who seek to emulate her just nature under the earth."
 dwarven_pantheon.106.a:0 "Divine Justice? Useful!"
 dwarven_pantheon.106.b:0 "Divine Justice? Worrying…"

 dwarven_pantheon.107.t:0 "Lorgrim"
 dwarven_pantheon.107.d:0 "We have pieced together enough information on another god. When Death entered the world and ended the Era of Forging, Lorgrim and her twin brother suddenly appeared. Lorgrim's role was to gather the souls of Dwarvenkind while Dagrin stood stupefied as the oldest of his people suddenly grew weak and perished from the monsters known as Age and Sickness. Lorgrim wandered the world, gathering the dwarven dead and bringing them to the care of her yet-to-be-discovered twin brother."
 dwarven_pantheon.107.a:0 "Maybe she could guide us as well?"
 dwarven_pantheon.107.b:0 "What are the implications of this?"

 dwarven_pantheon.108.t:0 "Lorgram"
 dwarven_pantheon.108.d:0 "We have pieced together enough information on another god. When Death entered the world at the end of the Era of Forging, Lorgram and his twin sister suddenly appeared. Lorgram began to ensure that the souls of the dead were taken into Dagrin's halls and organised into areas based on their skills and virtues in life. Here in the deeper reaches, he acts as keeper and custodian, ensuring that the dead are rewarded or punished accordingly."
 dwarven_pantheon.108.a:0 "Interesting, continue on!"
 dwarven_pantheon.108.b:0 "Interesting, steady pace…"

 dwarven_pantheon.109.t:0 "Twin Gods"
 dwarven_pantheon.109.d:0 "With the discovery of Lorgrim and Lorgram, a question has arisen that no doubt plagued the theologians of the old faith. The question is, where did Lorgrim and Lorgram come from? Not even the ancient dwarves knew. Every other god that we have discovered thus far has a defined origin, but these two just appeared. It has upset a number of scholars who demand that we halt our studies for a time to properly consider the possible implications that this lack of origin could cause in society as a whole."
 dwarven_pantheon.109.a:0 "Who cares, keep looking for more gods."
 dwarven_pantheon.109.b:0 "Perhaps we should…"

 dwarven_pantheon.110.t:0 "Forgotten Deity"
 dwarven_pantheon.110.d:0 "Great news! After extensive excavation, research, and reconstruction efforts, we have unearthed a temple dedicated to a major god of the old pantheon. The temple is in relatively good condition and contains a plethora of objects that can be studied and restored. A team of experts has compiled a rough summary of their findings in order to share their discovery with the world."
 dwarven_pantheon.110.a:0 "Very useful, keep up the good work!"
 dwarven_pantheon.110.b:0 "Very useful, keep up the steady work."

 dwarven_pantheon.111.t:0 "The Many Gods of the Pantheon"
 dwarven_pantheon.111.d:0 "After much excavation, research, and reconstruction we have discovered the temple to a minor god of the pantheon in relatively good condition, replete with objects for study and restoration. A team of experts have put together a rough summary of their findings in an effort to disseminate their discovery."
 dwarven_pantheon.111.a:0 "Useful, keep up the good work!"
 dwarven_pantheon.111.b:0 "Useful, keep up the steady work."

 dwarven_pantheon.112.t:0 "Prepared"
 dwarven_pantheon.112.d:0 "Many of our reclaimers and scholars believe that we have recovered enough gods to begin proper veneration of a reconstructed pantheon. However, many also admit that there are still significant gaps in their knowledge, and some suggest putting off official conversion until they are more filled. Regardless, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has the final say in whether or not we officially change to the faith of our ancestors instead of our ancestral faith."
 dwarven_pantheon.112.a:0 "For the gods!"
 dwarven_pantheon.112.b:0 "But what if there's more?"

 dwarven_pantheon.113.t:0 "End of the Journey"
 dwarven_pantheon.113.d:0 "With another minor god discovered, many of our foremost experts on the Pantheon have become the burgeoning Pantheon priesthood of the various gods we have rediscovered. Indeed, even [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided that it is now time to officially convert. In a grand ceremony, [Root.Monarch.GetName] swore to Dagrin to rule with wisdom and great leadership and was confirmed by all the high priests of the officially reinstated clergies of the Pantheon."
 dwarven_pantheon.113.a:0 "Finally, it's over."

 dwarven_pantheon.200.t:0 "The Godwake"
 dwarven_pantheon.200.d:0 "Turmoil engulfs the country. Our decision to abandon Ancestor Worship has upset or enraged significant portions of the state, the army, and the civilian population as a whole. Ancestor Worship fanatics have begun agitating for open rebellion, and evidently, some individuals are certainly contemplating it, if they are not already moving in secret to do so. This will certainly be a period of turmoil unlike anything we have experienced before. For this is a struggle near unheard of in dwarven society: a struggle of faith."
 dwarven_pantheon.200.a:0 "So it begins."

 dwarven_pantheon.201.t:0 "The Dwarven Pantheon"
 dwarven_pantheon.201.d:0 "We have received news of another nation completing their rediscovery of the Pantheon before us. Many decry our caution and lack of haste as a missed opportunity to prove our piety and faith. Others are using this as an opportunity to demand that we return to the one true path that our ancestors walked and not bother revering gods who had abandoned our race before. Of course, where [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] walks, most will follow."
 dwarven_pantheon.201.d2:0 "Another nation has abandoned Ancestor Worship and turned to the Pantheon. This has led to discontent, as some are now demanding that we also take up worship of the Pantheon. Others demand that we stay loyal to the one true path that our ancestors walked and not bother revering gods who had abandoned our race before. Of course, where [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] walks, most will follow."
 dwarven_pantheon.201.a:0 "Curses."
 dwarven_pantheon.201.b:0 "The Pantheon will light our future."
 dwarven_pantheon.201.c:0 "We shall remain loyal to our ancestors."

 dwarven_pantheon.202.t:0 "The Stone Keepers"
 dwarven_pantheon.202.d:0 "The Stone Keepers, the traditional priests of Ancestor Worship, had long been an important part of our country. However, with our official conversion to Pantheonism, the communities they represent and the power they once had have become increasingly marginalised. Now, several representatives have come forward to us, demanding that if we will not 'return to the fold,' then we must formally issue a rather humiliating series of concessions, such as letting them worship and practice in peace, among others."
 dwarven_pantheon.202.a:0 "We will make amends."
 dwarven_pantheon.202.b:0 "They'll get over it."


 dwarven_pantheon.203.t:0 "Ancestral Warrior"
 dwarven_pantheon.203.d:0 "One of our more minor military commanders, an individual with a very promising military future, to say the least, has been revealed to be part of a plot to overthrow [Root.Monarch.GetName] and reinstate Ancestor Worship. Instead of surrendering peacefully, he gathered a large number of supporters from the military and local militia and launched a well-armed rebellion ahead of schedule. Fortunately, the other backers have not taken the opportunity to strike."
 dwarven_pantheon.203.a:0 "Why can't you see reason?"

 dwarven_pantheon.204.t:0 "Our Ancestors"
 dwarven_pantheon.204.d:0 "A large part of the issue for people who remain devoted to Ancestor Worship is the fear, perhaps not necessarily unfounded, that the deeds, efforts, and tales of their ancestors will be cast aside and forgotten, just as the gods that many of their friends and family now turn to were. We could certainly ease these concerns, but it would not be painless or cheap. However, ignoring or, worse, dismissing them entirely would likely lead to further unrest."
 dwarven_pantheon.204.a:0 "Not worshipped, but still honoured."
 dwarven_pantheon.204.b:0 "They remain in our past."

 dwarven_pantheon.205.t:0 "Divided Court"
 dwarven_pantheon.205.d:0 "The chaos of the Godwake has not spared even our court, with many within our halls refusing to turn to the Pantheon. Debates and discourse are rife, and court intrigue — dangerous even in the best of times — has turned deadly. The worst offenders on both sides hold no shame about it. Something must be done, and quickly. One of our closest advisors suggests holding a large theological debate, followed by a feast, to calm tensions and help air grievances. Another suggests the practical approach of simply banishing the Ancestor Worship adherents from our court. Neither option will be without cost, whether in gold or in blood."
 dwarven_pantheon.205.a:0 "A feast for body, mind, and soul you say?"
 dwarven_pantheon.205.b:0 "Remove. Them. All."

 dwarven_pantheon.206.t:0 "Dagrin Everbeard"
 dwarven_pantheon.206.d:0 "The discovery that Dagrin Everbeard is both an ancestor of Dwarvenkind and a god has sparked intense theological debate on what this means for our race. Some are questioning whether this implies that we are divine in some way. If so, have we always been divine or did we lose our divinity at some point in the distant past? On the other hand, if we were never divine, does that mean Dagrin is not truly a god? And what, precisely, defines a god in the first place? While official interpretations have been released, these questions have added another layer of complexity to the ongoing religious awakening of our people."
 dwarven_pantheon.206.a:0 "I didn't see this coming."

 dwarven_pantheon.207.t:0 "Disgruntled Successor"
 dwarven_pantheon.207.d:0 "Our ruler's conversion has not only shattered political and religious ties but also familial bonds. The heir to our nation, has been seen associating with various pro-Ancestor individuals and groups. Whether this is a misguided attempt at reconciliation or a deliberate insult to [Root.Monarch.GetName], the outcome remains the same - discontent from all sides for one reason or another, leaving [Root.Monarch.GetName] infuriated."
 dwarven_pantheon.207.a:0 "Why are you like this."

 dwarven_pantheon.208.t:0 "Doomsayers"
 dwarven_pantheon.208.d:0 "A cult of Ancestor Worshippers has emerged and is coordinating activities throughout our country. Several preachers have taken to the streets, spreading messages of doom and gloom, warning that we will abandon the Pantheon in times of trouble just like our ancient dwarven ancestors did, and that our nation will fall just like Aul-Dwarov did. Nonetheless, we have apprehended most of them and put them in chains. We should issue a statement to address these concerns and reassure the people."
 dwarven_pantheon.208.a:0 "We are stronger than they were"
 dwarven_pantheon.208.b:0 "We honestly might go back"

 dwarven_pantheon.209.t:0 "Faith Abroad"
 dwarven_pantheon.209.d:0 "A group of Pantheon-worshipping dwarves from abroad have started to criticise our practices and veneration, pointing out the absence of a god that they believe to be essential. Their attempts to "correct" our practices have infuriated several religious officials, and news of this is spreading quickly, causing unrest in its wake."
 dwarven_pantheon.209.a:0 "Infuriating."

 dwarven_pantheon.210.t:0 "Sword Against the Darkness"
 dwarven_pantheon.210.d:0 "Despite the unrest at home, a group of dwarves has begun to band together to hunt down goblins and orcs within our borders. This is not an unusual practice, but what makes this case unique is that this group of hardened veterans seeks the blessing of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to leave our borders and bring death to the enemies of our race through a ritual that only they can perform. Sending a band of well-armed veterans out on such a dangerous mission is a difficult decision to make, even in times of peace, but during this time of trouble, some may view it as an opportunity or, even worse, a sign of weakness."
 dwarven_pantheon.210.a:0 "May their blades strike true."
 dwarven_pantheon.210.b:0 "They must remain, they are needed here."

 dwarven_pantheon.211.t:0 "Writing on the Walls"
 dwarven_pantheon.211.d:0 "While clearing out an old section of the hold, a surprised dwarven barkeep uncovered a completely intact chapel dedicated to one of the gods of the Pantheon while expanding his root cellar. Already, many are lining up outside his pub to get a pint and marvel at the craftsdwarfship of our ancestors. In a gesture of good faith, he has granted many of our clergy access to record and restore the temple to its function. A summary has already been prepared for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName]'s viewing."
 dwarven_pantheon.211.a:0 "By Dagrin's Beard!"

 dwarven_pantheon.212.t:0 "The Broken Crown"
 dwarven_pantheon.212.d:0 "As we strive to reclaim both our ancestral home and faith, we stand at the threshold of a new era for Dwarvenkind. A renewed hope has emerged to restore the long-lost Empire of Aul-Dwarov. However, one crucial element must be secured before any claims of rulership can be made - the Dwarovkron. This has led to a growing demand to ensure that we, and only we, possess all the pieces. Some Ancestor Worshippers have taken offence to this call to action and twisted it into an insult, suggesting that we believe ourselves to be more legitimate than they are. It is imperative that we communicate a clear and unambiguous message to all parties involved, but what should that message be?"
 dwarven_pantheon.212.a:0 "We, not they, will reforge what was broken."
 dwarven_pantheon.212.b:0 "It's just a crown, we don't need it."

 dwarven_pantheon.250.t:0 "Ancestral Rage"
 dwarven_pantheon.250.d:0 "The more time passes, the more it seems that the ever-increasing minority of Ancestor Worshippers is growing louder and more dangerous. In [event_province.GetName], one group has even gone to such lengths as to assault and massacre an entire chapel of hapless Pantheonists with pickaxes and other mining instruments, with the intention of destroying the temple as an affront to the ancestors. Eventually, the local guard managed to break in and kill or capture the responsible ones. However, this brings little comfort to the families of the slain and the survivors."
 dwarven_pantheon.250.a:0 "Why must they be like this?"

 dwarven_pantheon.251.t:0 "Opportunistic Raiders"
 dwarven_pantheon.251.d:0 "Out in the darkness of the Dwarovar, there are eyes watching us from the dark. Our ancestral enemies see our petty squabbles and laugh, knowing that it is conflicts like these that give them an opportunity. One band has taken advantage of this opportunity. A group of goblins struck deep behind our defensive lines and pillaged [event_province.GetName] before skulking back into the darkness. To make matters worse, local representatives of both Ancestor Worship and Pantheon communities are now blaming each other for allowing the goblins into the area to attack the faithful of their respective sides."
 dwarven_pantheon.251.a:0 "I am surrounded by fools!"

 dwarven_pantheon.252.t:0 "Unholy Greed"
 dwarven_pantheon.252.d:0 "A number of Ancestor Worshipping dwarves in [event_province.GetName] have begun charging extortionate prices or outright refusing to purchase from or sell to Pantheonists. This action seems to be spearheaded by numerous local shopkeepers and even entire guilds. As a result, this has brought the local economy to a standstill as critical industries can no longer acquire necessary materials and are forced to import from elsewhere in the country. While the slightly higher taxes involving the transport and import of materials may provide some solace to the locals, at least the state can make some gains from this situation."
 dwarven_pantheon.252.a:0 "How terrible…"

 dwarven_pantheon.253.t:0 "Battle of Faith"
 dwarven_pantheon.253.d:0 "Fighting rages through the streets of [event_province.GetName] as small tavern brawls and occasional street fights have exploded like a keg of strong ale set alight. Entire blocks of [event_province.GetName] are held by one side or another, as individuals are forced to flee their homes to areas where their religious choice holds preference or risk being executed by bands of zealots. The local garrison is under siege, with Ancestor Worshippers under the command of a charismatic demagogue who is calling for the execution of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 dwarven_pantheon.253.a:0 "This is very bad."

 dwarven_pantheon.299.t:0 "Awake at Last"
 dwarven_pantheon.299.d:0 "Like a dying fire, the chaos of the Godwake has finally begun to cool down, settling into embers and ashes as our nation has finally settled into a new status quo. The remaining Ancestor Worshippers have come to accept that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has embraced the Pantheon of our ancestors and will not be changing back to their old ways. While we have also accepted this change, our rivals and enemies have not been idle."
 dwarven_pantheon.299.a:0 "Let our enemies tremble."

 dwarven_pantheon.300.d:0 "The decline and fall of Aul-Dwarov left our hold isolated and adrift in a changing world. Although others faltered, we did not abandon our faith. Nevertheless, our isolation was not without loss. Many divinities had their priests and temples led by priests sent from holds within the Serpentspine to ensure proper observance of rites. As times changed and Aul-Dwarov fell, we were forced to tend these shrines and uphold these rituals ourselves. Eventually, limited resources and manpower forced us to abandon these rituals for the sake of survival. But times are changing once again. The world is stirring, and the old gods are calling their people back to the fold. We shall answer the call once we figure out how. Many clans still hold onto odd rituals and tomes that could help us re-establish the worship of these forgotten gods."

As a result, their worship has finally been revived, and the first temple devoted to their worship has been consecrated in accordance with proper rites after centuries of silence. Numerous aspirants now flock to the temple, seeking to join the new clergy or simply offer prayers and donations to ensure that their faith is not forgotten once more."

 dwarven_pantheon.302.d:0 "After much effort, we have successfully retrieved enough ritual books, artwork, and tomes related to theology to confidently establish new temples and appoint new priests for another forgotten god of the pantheon. As a result, we have completed the first temple to this newly remembered divinity in [Root.Capital.GetName], with the hope that it will be the first of many to come dedicated to this deity."

 desc_dagrin_adm_aspect:0 "Dagrin and his worship are extensive and nearly omnipresent facets of our country. As the chief god, Dagrin is expected to lead with wisdom and foresight, and so he must be trusted to do what is best, even if the other gods do not see it right away. Much the same is expected of the ruler of Halann, where they lead and the rest follow, trusting them to guide them down the right path.\n\n§DRitual:§! Dagrin blesses us with stability, the minor deities will bless us with various other bonuses."
 dagrin_dip_aspect:0 "§DDagrin Everbeard§!"
 desc_dagrin_dip_aspect:0 "The veneration of Dagrin Everbeard is among our greatest priorities, but the Priesthood of Dagrin does not hold him in higher regard than the other gods of the Pantheon. Many of the most significant temples devoted to Dagrin have alcoves and shrines dedicated to all the other gods of the Pantheon. Even in rural areas, most temples dedicated to Dagrin feature alcoves for the priesthoods that cannot support a complete temple. A ruler, whether mortal or divine, must take care of all of their subjects.\n\n§DRitual:§! Dagrin blesses us with stability, the minor deities will bless us with various other bonuses."
