 G67_1_1_delving_deeper_title: "Delving Deeper"
 G67_1_1_delving_deeper_desc: "In the heart of Royakottar lies the remains of the Steel-Scorched Citadel. Formerly a monolithic Precursor fortress, its construction involved a nearly unfathomable amount of Precursor metal – ever since the ruins were rediscovered, the scavengers of Royakottar, the Kattyva family chief among them, have dedicated themselves to excavating them and extracting as much scrap metal as they possibly can from it. The economic backbone of the city, investing in the excavation of the ruins is vital for our economy – and by using the Kotakompu of Uesrennu, famed for their digging abilities, we may be able to increase our scavengers productivity."

 G67_1_3_defiance_denied_title: "Defiance Denied"
 G67_1_3_defiance_denied_desc: "Led by Erankar the Defiant – a leader of a calibre Taychend has not seen for a long time – the golden city of Urvand has, in recent years, threatened to emulate the past unifiers of Taychend, sweeping down from the Larankarha highlands on horseback and conquering all before them. But it is Royakottar, not Urvand, that will become the greatest city of Taychend – it is time to cut these northerners back down to size!"

 G67_2_1_kadradars_ambition_title: "Kadradar's Ambition"
 G67_2_1_kadradars_ambition_desc: "When Kadradar the Stormbringer found his infamous relic, the Everstorm Gauntlet, within the ruins of Royakottar, it heralded a war that would bring half of Taychend to ruin. With incredible command over evocation magic, Kadradar annihilated armies and cities through thunder and lightning, conquering large parts of Taychend before he was finally brought down by an unprecedented coalition of disparate warlords from across the subcontinent. As heirs to Kadradar’s ambition, let us set our sights on recreating his conquests, with his first target as ours – Nanru Nakar must fall!"

 G67_2_2_cult_of_the_stormbringer_title: "Cult of the Stormbringer"
 G67_2_2_cult_of_the_stormbringer_desc: "Tens of thousands of hero-cults litter Taychend, each town, village or city having their own storied past of famous figures and glorious ancestors. In Royakottar, Kadradar’s takes pre-eminence – and its focus on military dominance and subjugation especially may prove very useful to us indeed. By sponsoring and expanding the influence of the Cult of the Stormbringer, we may be able to inspire our own people to emulate our most famous ruler."

 G67_2_3_shields_of_ruin_title: "Shields of Ruin"
 G67_2_3_shields_of_ruin_desc: "The Kattyva family are relic scavengers through and through, travelling across the Kalavend in search of new ruins to excavate, picking apart rock and metal for their own use, or to send to the Vustarin to forge into new forms. However, they are also devoted followers of the Stormbringer, and are dedicated to using the gifts of the past to win a glorious future in battle. Already, they go into battle wielding scraps of the past, shields of ruin protecting them from harm – by developing this “Vanguard Infantry”, we can have at our disposable a formidable force indeed."

 G67_2_4_a_forced_renegotiation_title: "A Forced Renegotiation"
 G67_2_4_a_forced_renegotiation_desc: "Chendhyan mercenaries are some of the most desirable in all of Taychend, their ferocity, manoeuvrability and numbers making any army augmented by the cat riders from the west a formidable force. Nonetheless, the city of Oremvand to the far east has had a stranglehold on a large part of the Chendhyan market for centuries, their own mercenary armies largely staffed by them. But with Royakottar’s influence increasingly encroaching on the steppe, many feel that it may be time to “convince” the Chendhyans to renegotiate their contracts – especially the feared protectors of Oremvand itself, the Haebyziae tribe."

 G67_3_1_calling_on_old_friends_title: "Calling on Old Friends"
 G67_3_1_calling_on_old_friends_desc: "Kalazhil “Bronzewing” Rekkatemir was, before he overthrew the previous Dhavana of Royakottar with the support of the Four Families, a Yodhanpir mercenary captain, working for disparate warlords across Taychend. Needless to say, Kalazhil has a wide variety of contacts from his days as a mercenary captain, particularly among his Yodhanpir brethren – if we are to survive the current crisis, with Kheionai invaders coming from the south and Erankar descending from the north, our rulers will have to pull on every lever they have, even if it means calling on some old friends."

 G67_3_2_king_of_the_kalavend_title: "King of the Kalavend"
 G67_3_2_king_of_the_kalavend_desc: "Royakottar has often played second fiddle to the other great power of the Kalavend, Nanru Nakar. No longer. With the various cities of the river under our control, we will assume the mantle that is rightfully ours, as the new Kings of the Kalavend!"

 G67_3_3_dhavana_arbitrator_title: "Dhavana Arbitrator"
 G67_3_3_dhavana_arbitrator_desc: "Kalazhil Rekkatemir forged a new role for the previously relatively weak warlords of Royakottar, who were often domineered by the Four Families. He saw himself as the central pillar holding together the different factions of the city through his command of outsider, mercenary forces – if we are to dominate Taychend in the years to come, we must continue his legacy, and balance the forces of Royakottar, lest their petty squabbles tear us apart."

 G67_3_4_city_of_scrap_and_salvage_title: "City of Scrap and Salvage"
 G67_3_4_city_of_scrap_and_salvage_desc: "From the ruins of the Steel-Scorched Citadel, always abuzz with workers and miners excavating the ruins, to the scrap walls of the city, recently reinforced, or the underground workshops of the Vustarin, or the warm glow that always emanates from the House of Vice, the power of Royakottar has always been visible in every corner of the city – and, with our city’s influence expanding further by the day, there is no doubt that we are the most important city beneath the Veyii Sikarha – well deserving of our title as the City of Scrap and Salvage!"

 G67_3_5_four_becomes_one_title: "Four Becomes One"
 G67_3_5_four_becomes_one_desc: "It is over – Taychend stands united under Royakottar’s banner, our armies sweeping all before us like Ebenanth and Olhokar before us. But the game is not yet over – the final act yet approaches, and time will tell whether the families of Royakottar will unite under the Mercenary King, or whether one group will rise to absolute prominence – no matter what happens though, one thing is clear. Four will become one, one way or the other…"

 G67_4_1_blue_swords_blue_sea_title: "Blue Swords, Blue Sea"
 G67_4_1_blue_swords_blue_sea_desc: "The city of Orenkoraim dominates the mouth of the Kalavend, growing rich off of its control of the sea trade flowing out of the other cities of the river. If we are to expand our own power, the city presents an obvious target – especially considering the needs of the Nymkorai, Royakottar’s premier trading company, who have considerable interests in our eastern neighbour."

 G67_4_2_ursibadur_vice_title: "Ursibadur Vice"
 G67_4_2_ursibadur_vice_desc: "The Ursibadur family thrives off of the travellers and traders who come to Royakottar, having a stranglehold on every vice and pleasure that a weary elf might desire. Bars and brothels, casinos and theatres, the Ursibadur controls it all – and it is therefore no wonder that the prosperity of the city they serve is of paramount importance to them. And who knows? Should we fulfil their wishes, they may even receive a personal invitation to the heart of their empire, the House of Vice."

 G67_4_3_walls_of_metal_title: "Walls of Metal"
 G67_4_3_walls_of_metal_desc: "Perhaps the most striking feature of Royakottar – putting aside the massive excavation-hole in the centre of the city – are the scrap walls that surround it. Stone brick is clad in jagged Precursor metal, incredibly resistant to projectile attacks and magic assaults. However, recent innovations in siege technology are beginning to threaten the walls of Royakottar – we must look to the Vustarin and Kattyva families in order to renovate them, or face potential disaster."

 G67_4_4_mercs_maize_and_mirth_title: "Mercs, Maize, and Mirth"
 G67_4_4_mercs_maize_and_mirth_desc: "The Ursibadur will go to war, but the one thing they crave is peace. Peace puts gold in their pocket, grain in their stores and distilleries, and more people in their brothel-beds and at their casino tables. No wonder, then, that they would ask so much of us for that purpose. By expanding our mercenary army, investing in our fields and improving the trade routes that connect our empire, the Ursibadur will surely reward us greatly indeed."

 G67_5_1_scholars_mate_title: "Scholar's Mate"
 G67_5_1_scholars_mate_desc: "Katelperai is a city of exiles and scholars, unimaginable amounts of strange and esoteric knowledge hidden within its walls. No wonder, then, it has attracted the attention of our own scholarly family, the Vustarin – always hungering for new knowledge, they have set their eyes on the archives and hidden laboratories of the city, and will no doubt ransack the tiered city for every scrap their can find once we take it."

 G67_5_4_a_look_into_the_past_title: "A Look into the Past"
 G67_5_4_a_look_into_the_past_desc: "The Vustarin come from Sthanan ith Vussam, abandoning the stuffy old libraries of the city in search of new knowledge, new power. And now, alongside our mercenary armies, they return, intent on “repossessing” the books and artefacts they should have taken with them when they first left. By storming the various centres of knowledge in southern Taychend – the Blue House of Nagar Vyechei, the hilltop ruins of Uyarbaid, and of course Sthanan’s Violet Library, the Vustarin may be able to better look into Taychend’s storied past."

 royakottar_events.0.t: "Under the Bronze Wing"
 royakottar_events.0.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] rubbed at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rough beard nervously as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] watched the leaders of the Four Families and their close associates enter, taking their seats at the long conference table. Even two years after [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] accession to the throne [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sat uneasily. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was a foreigner and a former mercenary, brought in as a compromise pick when the old leader no longer suited the Families’ collective purposes.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] grimaced – [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knew they could just as easily replace [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. His wife Isermanthi, who was standing beside [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], placed a hand on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] shoulder, offering [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a reassuring smile – [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would get through this, one way or another. Finally, once the family heads were seated, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] spoke. “I’ve brought you here today in light of the worrying news from the south. With Laskaris once again on the warpath…”\n\nKalazhil spoke of dangers from the north and south, then to more internal matters. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] noted the reactions of the different heads as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did so. The head of the Kattyva looked bored, barely listening – he knew he didn’t need to. Seronpan Nymkorai studied the other family heads and their attendants himself, ever vigilant, always scheming. The patriarch of the Ursibadur leered at Kalazhil’s wife, while the head of the Vustarin took copious notes, fingers stained with ink. The family heads were all powerful – but they were all different. If [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not take those differences into account, they would overcome [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\nAs Kalazhil finished the pre-prepared parts of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] speech, he glanced at his wife, who offered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a knowing smirk in response. “But of course we have bigger problems. And they start with you!” That got their attention. “Spiked wine in the House of Vice from Nymkorai crates, a Vustarin scion dead at a Kattyva’s sabre-tip…!” Isermanthi had done some fine work indeed finding all this out. “Make no mistake, our city’s future is on the line–” the Bronzewing stood up, slamming a gauntleted fist on the table, “–but instead, we squabble and bicker while war approaches! No longer! We march together as one – to conquer Taychend!”\n\nKalazhil looked around the room, at the faces looking at him half in awe. Their king, not their puppet. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] smiled wide. “Here I stand, your [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s ambition laid bare… be prepared!""
 royakottar_events.0.a: "We march to conquer Taychend – and the families must march with us…"
 royakottar_events.1.t: "Blue Swords"
 royakottar_events.1.d: "Vindar Kalavna awoke to the sounds of sea birds and lapping waves – to the feel of binds around his wrists, ankles and stomach. He ached everywhere, his muscles burning when he tried to struggle against the ropes binding him to the chair he was sitting on. He looked around him – they were atop the sea-facing walls of Kottar Orenkoriam, the ocean far below them.\n“No use struggling, Mister Kalavna. The deal is done…” Vindar looked to the source of the familiar voice – the elf it came from was counting and inspecting stacks of golden coins arrayed on the wall, twin sabres hung on his back. Seronpan Nymkorai.\nVindar’s eyes widened with rage. A few days ago he had refused an offer of acquisition from the Nymkorai family – clearly their patriarch had rejected that refusal. “I’ll have– my family will have your head for this! If you think this will accomplish anything, you’re wrong!” Vindar shouted with a hoarse voice. “My children–!”\n“Your firstborn’s swimming with the fishes, Mister Kalavna.” Seronpan said in a deadpan voice, still counting his coins. “And soon, you will be too...” Vindar’s heart dropped. But he hadn’t mentioned his other child! If he had escaped, maybe–\n“Pelozhil!” Seronpan called. Vindar’s secondborn son walked into the ageing merchant’s view, unbound, untouched, approaching the head of the Nymkorai. Vindar called out to him, but the young man couldn’t even bare to look in his direction. Seronpan gestured to the stacks of gold. “Your payment. I trust you will spend it wisely – and that you’ll find your new job under my family satisfactory.” Pelozhil Kalavna accepted the money, turning to his father one last time.\n“I’m sorry, father.” He said, a grim look on his face. “You always neglected me, and– and–” Tears formed at the corners of his eyes. Pelozhil turned away, speaking softly under his breath. “I never would have inherited the company anyway. They gave me an offer I couldn’t refuse…” Vindar slumped back in his chair, the fight gone, as his son walked away. He had been betrayed.\nSeronpan, he turned to one of his guards, a wry smile on his face. “Camnan, I think our friend might be a getting a little thirsty. Why don’t we give him a drink?” The Nymkorai head laughed heartily, his guards following suit."
 royakottar_events.1.a: "A moment later, they threw Vindar into the blue sea."
 royakottar_events.2.t: "Ursibadur Vice"
 royakottar_events.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] grimaced as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] walked through the House of Vice, embarrassed despite [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] station. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] could see every trade the Ursibadurs dabbled in as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] passed through the halls – scantily clad elven dancers and courtesans, packed gambling tables, drunken patrons stumbling from bar to bar. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finally reached the resplendent office of Evindash Ursibadur, the patriarch of the family, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] found the man reclined on his chair, silken boots resting on his desk. He smiled warmly as he gestured for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to sit down. “How did you find the House, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]?” He asked. “I instructed my family to offer you anything you desired. I trust you–”\n“I wasn’t interested.” the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] responded, coldly. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had indeed been offered many gifts – spirits and White Lelivazha, a private show, a few companions for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pleasure. “Not my idea of fun.”\nEvindash chuckled, offering a nonchalant shrug in response. “Well, I suppose it was a fool’s game anyway.” He poured [Root.Monarch.GetName] a cup of wine – the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] accepted this, at least. “If you were so willing to partake, I wouldn’t need to invite you. Do you know why I did?”\nThe warlord shook [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] brought the wine up to take a sip. The Ursibadur laughed heartily in response. “I suppose I wonder if you undervalue my family’s contribution to the city – I had hoped to show you at least a part of that,” he said, gesturing with a free hand as he took a swig of his own wine. “But the mercenary king stands above, I suppose. So I may as well give you a few words and send you on your way. Tell me, what do you think drives elves to fight? To conquer? Betray?”\n“Ambition.” [Root.Monarch.GetName] replied instantly, from cultural instinct. “Glory in life and after – apotheosis, a place in the heavens.”\n“Yes… desire!” the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was about to protest the twisting of his words, but Evindash Ursibadur cut him off. “What you have just described is desire! A bodily need, nothing holy or sacred. You lust for glory and thirst for divinity just as you’d lust for your partner or thirst for a good drink!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat back in his chair with a sullen look, crossing his arms. “Soul and body are of the same system, my friend. Just as you cater to your people’s desire for death and glory, I cater to their desire for a good time!”\nFor a second, [Root.Monarch.GetName] remained solemn – but as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked at the Ursibadur’s ernest smile, the passion written clearly on his face, he couldn’t help but let it affect [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] raised [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cup to the patriarch."
 royakottar_events.2.a: "“Then I trust you’ll continue to do so, Evindash. For my people’s sake.”"
 royakottar_events.3.t: "Shields of Ruin"
 royakottar_events.3.d: "Uratand Kattyva sighed, shaking his head. This was supposed to be a simple acquisition, and now the warlord and the patriarch met in the ground between their two armies, as their soldiers lined up behind them. “I know,” Uratand began, crossing his arms, “that you are very possessive of your territory. But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has given me the rights to this land. You wouldn’t be rebelling against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], would you?”\n\nThe petty warlord grinned. “If whatever is under my city is valuable enough to attract the attention of the Kattyva, maybe I am!” The Kattyva head had half a mind to tell him that he was rather sure it was only a half-collapsed slave warren, but he decided against it. To be honest, he wanted a battle – the Kattyva were founded in emulation of their god-hero, Kadradar the Stormbringer. They scoured Taychend in the hopes that one day, they too would uncover a relic as powerful as his, using it to embark on a glorious conquest. But with Royakottar’s borders advancing further by the day, that conquest would increasingly looking more like a palace coup.\n\nUratand sighed, placing a hand on his sword and readying the other to pull his shield out. “Your mother wishes you dead”, he said, deadpan and unprompted, as the warlord’s face twisted with anger, “your troops are ill-disciplined, your loins are barren, and your “city” is little more than a–“ Finally, the warlord snapped – though to Uratand’s surprise, he didn’t reach for the sabre on his back, but instead raised his hands to cast a spell – ready to incinerate his enemy with a fireball at point-blank range.\n\nLuckily, the Kattyva patriarch was prepared – instead of the firebolt striking flesh, and turning Uratand to ash, it slammed into his Ruin-Shield instead. The patriarch didn’t even feel the heat, the hunk of precursor steel dispersing the magic entirely. Uratand smiled, as he charged forward, staggering the petty warlord with the force of the shield and then finishing him off with his sword. Uratand assumed a defensive posture in his lonely position, as the enemy army charged forwards. His own army – his Vanguard Infantry – rushed ahead in turn. They reached their leader before the enemy did, their line holding firm as the late warlord’s levies crashed against their shields. Shields of the past, conquering the present."
 royakottar_events.3.a: "Just as Kadradar intended!"
 royakottar_events.4.t: "To Uncover, To Unwind"
 royakottar_events.4.d: "The narrow corridors of the Dumran Vustarvach glowed with a violet hue as [Root.Monarch.GetName] navigated [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way through them. There were so many books here from both before and after the great collapse – most useless, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was told – that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could barely comprehend it. After an hour of searching, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finally found [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] target – Arichana Vustarin, the matriarch of her family, who stood staring at the space between two bookshelves. \nThe matriarch sensed [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] presence. “What do you know, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], of the time before the fall of the Slaver-Nobles?” She asked, still staring up at whatever she was looking at – engrossed in its detail.\n“Not much.” the Dhavana admitted, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] got close enough to see the object of her attention – a tapestry hung on the wall, protected by a ward. It looked impossibly old. A flying city decorated the aged parchment – Tacenie, it was called.\n“Then you are just like everyone else.” Arichana said. Her eyes seemed affixed to the image. “We were immortal… our eyes glowed… slaver-nobles ruled Taychend, ruled themselves by some mythical empire, from this flying city.” Finally, she broke her gaze, turning to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. “And then it disappeared. Gone in an instant, as the skies darkened with ash, and the world descended into chaos. Do you know what happened to it?”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] shrugged, at a loss. “Nobody does. But… some were associated with it. Like Liandarha, first of the Mudaliars.”\nArichana turned back to the tapestry. “Yes… those who weren’t on it when it vanished – or survivors from its downfall. There are so many theories about Tacenie – maybe it flew off to parts unknown, or exploded in the sky, or crashed into the ground, surely causing unimaginable destruction. Or maybe they set it down somewhere. Maybe that flying city is out there, hiding, like so much of the past. Hiding, and waiting to be found. We are blind, stumbling around looking for scraps of the larger story.” Arichana stepped towards the parchment, brushing a hand over the shimmering ward. “But all it takes is one chance find… one fragment of the past…” the Vustarin smiled."
 royakottar_events.4.a: "... and it shall all unravel."
 royakottar_events.5.t: "Four Becomes One"
 royakottar_events.5.da: "“So we must seek other avenues of trade. To the newly discovered peoples to the west and east, for instance…” [Root.Monarch.GetName] reclined in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chair as Triander Nymkorai explained the finer details of imperial trade policy – [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] couldn’t help but be a little suspicious, as he talked of increasing Royakottari investments in various cities or sending trading expeditions to the west, no doubt staffed with Nymkorai merchants.\nJalinpan Ursibadur’s intervention calmed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nerves, though. “And if we were to attract travellers and merchants from these places… well, my family’s stocks of White Lelivazha are great… me and Triander have come to an agreement…” [Root.Monarch.GetName] smiled as the Ursibadur and Nymkorai spoke – worked – together, for the good of themselves, sure, but 	also the good of Royakottar. Once upon a time, the Nymkorai were spiking the House of Vice’s wine – but things were different now.\nAfter Jalinpan and Triander had finished making their point, [Root.Monarch.GetName] accepting their proposals with feigned indifference, it was time for the others to speak. Elrandar Kattyva made a report on the excavations of the citadel – progress on uncovering some newly discovered storage facility, reports on incidents involving workers and scavengers – and the ever-expanding operations across Taychend, Arichanna Vustarin piping in whenever she felt Elrandar was glossing over the historical or research implications for their finds. The two families had always had common interests, but for centuries those interests had led them to conflict, not cooperation. Now they were eagerly working on pet projects together, Kattyva scrap flowing into Vustarin laboratories unrestricted.\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] couldn’t help but be proud – on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own behalf, and that of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] forebears. The Mercenary Kings – Emperors, now – had done the impossible, turned four squabbling families in a divided city into one, unified force. And look at what they had done with it! Royakottar’s banners now hung from Clematar to Katelperai, a Taychend united for the first time in centuries. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was at the head of it, but the people gathered around the table stood with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Four had become one at last. Now, the real work began."
 royakottar_events.5.dk: "Royakottar burned. The Kattyva family originally had a much more sophisticated plan, which involved enough moving parts it made Elrandar Kattyva’s head spin when his subordinates tried to explain it to him – when their “best laid” plan immediately went awry, Elrandar’s disappointment was minimal. This was a far more glorious way to win power anyway.\nHe called out again, and the mages to his side launched another fire-ball volley against the royal palace. Finally, stone and brick broke and gave way, as his men surged forwards to assault the gaps in the palace walls. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s men sallied out to meet them – but they were no match for his Vanguard. Sabres met Ruin-Shields, and shattered under their power. Just as Kadradar intended.\nWell, not entirely as he intended – he had embarked on a conquest fuelled by the unparalleled power of his relic, not a palace coup like this. Though, considering their success, the Kattyva patriarch wondered if it really mattered. The Vustarin didn’t give much of a fight after their laboratories were smashed and attendants killed. The Ursibadur had given a good go at it, honourably surrendering and accepting exile back to their old home in Marhed Rayodana. The Nymkorai had been slaughtered to the last man. Now all that was left was the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] – and Elrandar could not help but smile as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was brought alive out of the burning remains of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace.\nThe Kattyva’s men dropped [Root.Monarch.GetName] in front of the patriarch – the deposed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] glaring at the patriarch with a look of pure rage. “You conniving, treacherous– fool!” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] spat through bloodied lips. “After all we’ve done–! And you think you can just take it all at the end?!”\nElrandar Kattyva laughed. “Have I not already?” He said, as he drew his sabre and gestured to the burning palace that bathed them in an orange glow. “The way I see it, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], this was always going to happen. We were always the masters of this city. The metal scrap that adorns this city, our shields? Our hands dug it up from the ground, my friend… we raised you from nothing… and now?” the patriarch smiled wide, as he aimed his sabre tip at [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s head, the satisfaction of victory washing over him. “I think we’ve earned the right to put you back in the dirt!”"
 royakottar_events.5.dn: "Arichanna Vustarin shook her head as she signed her name at the bottom of the parchment. “Exile to Katelperai, protection from further harm… access to the Violet Library and archives of the Nila Tenvach…” she read out the terms of the agreement as she looked over it one more time, before handing it to the person who had forced her to sign it. “Have your damn paper, Triander. I hope I never see you again.” The Vustarin matriarch left, flanked by Nymkorai guards.\nTriander couldn’t help but feel a little hurt – of all the various treaties and contracts he’d been making over the past few days, the Vustarin deal was by far one of the more lenient. The Kattyva had been broken apart, the remnant families subsumed into more loyal Nakari and Uesrenni scavenger guilds – all under the control of the Nymkorai, of course. The Ursibadur’s property had been acquired entirely, with jolly-old Jalinpan confined to his chambers in the House of Vice, his children taken as hostages. And, of course, there came the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Triander looked at the broken elf tied to a chair in the centre of the dimly lit room – the deposed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Royakottar, the old ruler of all Taychend. It was no accident that he had brought Arichanna down here to sign those papers – he wanted her to see the alternative.\nThe Nymkorai patriarch walked over to the deposed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], kneeling down in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and raising [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bloody and bruised face with a finger – [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was barely conscious. “Did you see this coming, my old friend? I wonder…” No matter now, he supposed, as the patriarch rose and made for the door. There was no need to kill him personally – he’d waste away down here on his own.\nAs he wandered through the city, Triander wondered what was next for him, for his family. They controlled all of Taychend, the next great unifiers of the region, like Ebenanth or Yodhan or Olhokar before them. What was left? Get rich? Maintain power? Try and avoid collapse like all the empires of the past? He had to admit – that last one appealed to him quite a lot. Digging Nymkorai tendrils into the very earth itself, rooting his family into the structure of the earth. Ruling through fear and intimidation and diplomacy and military might all at once… but that was a question for tomorrow. Today, of all days, the Nymkorai could rest, and think with a clear mind. They didn’t often get the opportunity."
 royakottar_events.5.du: "The Ursibadur patriarch pulled the [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] seated next to him on the dais into an embrace, clinking his cup to theirs. “By all the gods, do I love a good party!” he bellowed, as he surveyed the great feast in the hall of the House of Vice. “Music playing, dancers dancing, food and wine and merriment abundant! Is this not why we live, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]?” Jalinpan Ursibadur looked to his captive with a smirk on his face – he was met with a look of pure hatred, and not-so-silent rage.\n“If you think feasts and festivities will make me forget what you took from me,” the deposed [Root.Monarch.GetName] spat, as he pulled away from the elf who usurped his throne, “then you are a fool, Ursibadur!”\nJalinpan merely laughed in response, taking a swig of his drink. “Oh, you may be thinking that now, but give it a few years – the wine will wash away the hurt!” He gestured to the festivities with his cup. “Look at my Kingdom, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]! It has barely been a day and they have already forgotten!” the Ursibadur could see his own family mixing with the remnants of the others. Arichanna, the Vustarin matriarch spoke to Jalinpan’s son, a weary smile on her lips, as the patriarch of the Kattyva (the newly crowned head of the family) mingled with Jalinpan’s daughter, his new betrothed. The Nymkorai were all dead, but they were no fun at parties anyway – and their destruction would secure Ursibadur control of the trade routes of their new empire for generations.\nThe fighting had been relatively brutal – in the early stages at least, or throughout if you were a Nymkorai. Poor fellows, them. But after the dust had settled, what use was it settling old scores or engaging in wanton cruelty? This was a new realm, a new Taychend! Jalinpan turned again to the deposed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who was still sulking.\n“Please, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]… relax! We still have an empire to rule outside these walls, my friend – and if you are well behaved, maybe you’ll even get to see it again!” Jalinpan noticed the [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan]’s cup was empty – he graciously refilled it, along with his own. He offered the former [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a toast with a smile – to Jalinpan’s surprise, [Root.Monarch.GetName] accepted it, a small smirk appearing at the corner of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mouth. “Soon a new day will dawn,” the patriarch said, as the new and old ruler clinked their glasses together, “but that is for tomorrow! Today, we feast!”"
 royakottar_events.5.dv: "Arichanna Vustarin smiled as she took in the air of her new office. It was much more spacious than the old stuffy rooms of her family’s underground laboratories, in the upper rim of the Steel-Scorched Ruins. You could never get any peace and quiet there either, the sounds of the excavation of the ruins in the background ever-present – it was certainly wondrous that after hundreds of years they still hadn’t gotten to the bottom of the old citadel, but was small consolation.\nNo, the old royal palace was a fine choice for the new headquarters of her family – especially when they finally cleaned the blood from the floors. She looked back to the text she was reading, a “History of the Empire of the Mudaliars”, a dusty old tome by Threzarathi Darijita, a historian of the 12th century. She couldn’t help but spot a parallel here to her own actions, as at the end of empire, Geledish Rakulacan slew his teenage puppet and seized the remains of Nakari Empire for himself. There were differences, of course – Geledish had seized the scraps of an empire when it already faced irreversible decline, while she had seized an empire at its height, with Royakottar’s territory stretching from Katelperai to Clematar, Ahartadyam to Oremvand.\nArichanna wondered what she could do to prevent the downfall of that empire. “Look to the past!” was the answer that immediately sprung to her mind – it was why she was reading this book, why she had already begun to order sweeping surveys of precursor sites and potential relic hoards. But did she not also need to look to the present? Yesterday, she had sundered the other families – wiped out the Nymkorai, shattered and absorbed the Kattyva, taken the Ursibadur under her wing, now decidedly-junior partners to her rule. But other groups in Taychend remained – the Mudaliars of Nanru Nakar, the Sarihaddhi tribes, the Bloodcloak Brotherhood and the Cennayakuta of Imarchend. Those would have to be considered too.\nThe past, the present – but Arichanna knew she was forgetting something. The Vustarin matriarch closed her book with a sigh, as she sat back in her chair. The future… she was missing the future. A new day was dawning over Taychend, one where her family reigned supreme – and no matter what, they must look to the future, or else risk the fate of all the others who had come before them – the old King of Royakottar included."
