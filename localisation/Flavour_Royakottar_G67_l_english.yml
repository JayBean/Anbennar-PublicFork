 G67_1_1_delving_deeper_title: "Delving Deeper"
 G67_1_1_delving_deeper_desc: "In the heart of Royakottar lies the remains of the Steel-Scorched Citadel; a monolithic Precursor fortress constructed out of a nearly unfathomable amount of Precursor metal. Ever since the ruins were discovered, the scavengers of Royakottar, the Kattyva chief among them, have dedicated themselves to extracting as much scrap metal as possible from it. Investing in the excavation of the ruins, the economic backbone of the city, is vital for our economy – and by using the Kotakompu of Uesrennu, famed for their digging abilities, we may be able to increase our scavengers productivity."

 G67_1_3_defiance_denied_title: "Defiance Denied"
 G67_1_3_defiance_denied_desc: "Led by Erankar the Defiant – a leader of a calibre Taychend has not seen for ages – the golden city of Urvand has, in recent years, threatened to emulate the past unifiers of Taychend, sweeping down from the Larankarha highlands on horseback and conquering all before them. But it is Royakottar, not Urvand, that will become the greatest city of Taychend – it is time to cut these northerners back down to size!"

 G67_2_1_kadradars_ambition_title: "Kadradar's Ambition"
 G67_2_1_kadradars_ambition_desc: "When Kadradar the Stormbringer found his famous relic, the Everstorm Gauntlet, within the ruins of Royakottar, it heralded a war that would bring half of Taychend to ruin. With incredible command over evocation magic, Kadradar annihilated armies and cities with thunder and lightning, conquering large parts of Taychend before he was finally brought down by an unprecedented coalition of disparate warlords from across the subcontinent. As heirs to Kadradar’s ambition, let us set our sights on recreating his conquests, with his first target as ours – Nanru Nakar must fall!"

 G67_2_2_cult_of_the_stormbringer_title: "Cult of the Stormbringer"
 G67_2_2_cult_of_the_stormbringer_desc: "Tens of thousands of hero-cults litter Taychend. Each town, village or city has their own storied past of famous figures and glorious ancestors. In Royakottar, Kadradar’s takes pre-eminence – and its focus on military dominance and subjugation may prove very useful to us. By sponsoring and expanding the influence of the Cult of the Stormbringer, we may be able to inspire our own people to emulate our most famous hero."

 G67_2_3_shields_of_ruin_title: "Shields of Ruin"
 G67_2_3_shields_of_ruin_desc: "The Kattyva family are relic scavengers through and through, travelling across the Kalavend in search of new ruins to excavate, picking apart rock and metal for their own use or to send to the Vustarin to forge into new forms. However, they are also devotees of the Stormbringer, and are dedicated to using the gifts of the past to win a glorious future in battle. Already, they go into battle wielding scraps of the past – shields of ruin protecting them from harm. By developing this “Vanguard Infantry”, we can have at our disposal a formidable force indeed."

 G67_2_4_a_forced_renegotiation_title: "A Forced Renegotiation"
 G67_2_4_a_forced_renegotiation_desc: "Chendhyan warriors, fierce cat riders, are some of the most sought-after mercenaries in all of Taychend. Their ferocity, manoeuvrability, and large numbers turn any army they are a part of into a formidable force. The city of Oremvand to the far east has had a stranglehold on a large part of the Chendhyan market for centuries, with their own mercenary armies largely staffed by them. But with Royakottar’s influence encroaching on the steppe, many feel that it may be time to “convince” the Chendhyans to renegotiate their contracts – especially the feared protectors of Oremvand itself, the Haebyziae tribe."

 G67_3_1_calling_on_old_friends_title: "Calling on Old Friends"
 G67_3_1_calling_on_old_friends_desc: "Kalazhil “Bronzewing” Rekkatemir was a Yodhanpir mercenary captain, working for disparate warlords across Taychend before he overthrew the previous Dhavana of Royakottar with the support of the Four Families. Needless to say, Kalazhil has a wide variety of contacts from his days as a mercenary captain, particularly among his Yodhanpir brethren . I– if we are to survive the current crisis, with Kheionai invaders coming from the south and Erankar descending from the north, our rulers will have to pull on every lever they have, even if it means calling on some old friends."

 G67_3_2_king_of_the_kalavend_title: "King of the Kalavend"
 G67_3_2_king_of_the_kalavend_desc: "Royakottar has often played second fiddle to the other great power of the Kalavend – Nanru Nakar. No longer. With the various cities of the river under our control, we will assume the mantle that is rightfully ours, as the new Kings of the Kalavend!"

 G67_3_3_dhavana_arbitrator_title: "Dhavana Arbitrator"
 G67_3_3_dhavana_arbitrator_desc: "Kalazhil Rekkatemir forged a new role that distinguished him from the previously relatively weak warlords of Royakottar, who were often domineered by the Four Families. He saw himself as the central pillar holding together the different factions of the city through his command of outsider mercenary forces. If we are to dominate Taychend in the years to come, we must continue his legacy, and balance the forces of Royakottar, lest their petty squabbles tear us apart."

 G67_3_4_city_of_scrap_and_salvage_title: "City of Scrap and Salvage"
 G67_3_4_city_of_scrap_and_salvage_desc: "From the ruins of the Steel-Scorched Citadel, buzzing with scavengers and miners, to the recently reinforced walls of the city, to the warm glow of the House of Vice, the power of Royakottar is always visible. With our city’s influence expanding further by the day, there is no doubt that we are the most important city beneath the Veyii Sikarha – well deserving of our title as the City of Scrap and Salvage!"

 G67_3_5_four_becomes_one_title: "Four Becomes One"
 G67_3_5_four_becomes_one_desc: "It is over. Taychend stands united under Royakottar’s banner, our armies sweep our enemies like Ebenanth and Olhokar before us. But the game is not yet over, the final act approaches, and time will tell whether the families of Royakottar will unite under the Mercenary King, or whether one group will rise to absolute prominence. But no matter what happens, one thing is clear. Four will become one, one way or the other…"

 G67_4_1_blue_swords_blue_sea_title: "Blue Swords, Blue Sea"
 G67_4_1_blue_swords_blue_sea_desc: "The city of Orenkoraim dominates the mouth of the Kalavend, growing rich off its control of the trade flowing down from the river. If we are to expand our own power, the city presents an obvious target – especially considering the needs of the Nymkorai, Royakottar’s premier trading company, who have considerable interests in our eastern neighbour."

 G67_4_2_ursibadur_vice_title: "Ursibadur Vice"
 G67_4_2_ursibadur_vice_desc: "The Ursibadur family thrives off the travellers and traders who come to Royakottar, having a stranglehold on every vice and pleasure that a weary elf might desire. Bars and brothels, casinos and theatres, the Ursibadur controls it all, and it is therefore no wonder that the prosperity of the city is of paramount importance to them. And who knows? Should we fulfil their wishes, we may even receive a personal invitation to the heart of their empire, the House of Vice."

 G67_4_3_walls_of_metal_title: "Walls of Metal"
 G67_4_3_walls_of_metal_desc: "The most striking feature of Royakottar, aside from the massive excavation-hole in the city centre, are its scrap walls. Stone bricks are clad in jagged Precursor metal, known for its incredible resistance to projectile attacks and magic assaults. However, recent innovations in siege technology are beginning to threaten the walls of Royakottar – we must look to the Vustarin and Kattyva families in order to renovate them, or face potential disaster."

 G67_4_4_mercs_maize_and_mirth_title: "Mercs, Maize, and Mirth"
 G67_4_4_mercs_maize_and_mirth_desc: "The Ursibadur will go to war, but the one thing they crave is peace. Peace puts gold in their pocket, grain in their stores and distilleries, and more people in their brothel-beds, and at their casino tables. No wonder, then, that they would ask so much of us for that purpose. By expanding our mercenary army, investing in our fields and improving the trade routes that connect our empire, the Ursibadur will surely reward us greatly indeed."

 G67_5_1_scholars_mate_title: "Scholar's Mate"
 G67_5_1_scholars_mate_desc: "Katelperai is a city of exiles and scholars, unimaginable amounts of strange and esoteric knowledge is hidden within its walls. No wonder it has attracted the attention of our own scholarly family, the Vustarin – always hungering for new knowledge. They have set their eyes on the archives and hidden laboratories of the city, and will no doubt ransack the tiered city for every scrap they can find once we take it."

 G67_5_4_a_look_into_the_past_title: "A Look into the Past"
 G67_5_4_a_look_into_the_past_desc: "The Vustarin come from Sthanan ith Vussam, abandoning the stuffy old libraries of the city in search of new knowledge, new power. Now, alongside our mercenary armies, they return with the intent of “repossessing” the books and artefacts they should have taken with them when they left. By storming the various centres of knowledge in southern Taychend, the Blue House of Nagar Vyechei, the hilltop ruins of Uyarbaid, and Sthanan’s Violet Library, the Vustarin may be better able to look into Taychend’s storied past."

 #Events
 royakottar_events.0.t: "Under the Bronze Wing"
 royakottar_events.0.d: "Kalazhil scratched at his neatly trimmed beard as he watched the leaders of the Four Families and their close associates enter, taking their seats at the long conference table. Even two years after his accession to the throne he sat uneasily. He was a foreigner and a former mercenary, brought in as a compromise when the old leader no longer suited the Families’ collective purposes.\n\nHe grimaced. He knew they could just as easily replace him. His wife Isermanthi, who was standing beside him, placed a hand on his shoulder, offering him a reassuring smile. He would get through this, one way or another. Finally, once the family heads were seated, the Dhavana spoke. “I’ve brought you here today in light of the worrying news from the south. With Laskaris once again on the warpath…”\n\nKalazhil spoke of dangers from the north and south, then to more internal matters. He noted the reactions of the different heads as he did. The head of the Kattyva looked bored, barely listening – he knew he didn’t need to. Seronpan Nymkorai studied the other family heads and their attendants, ever vigilant, always scheming. The patriarch of the Ursibadur leered at Kalazhil’s wife, while the head of the Vustarin took copious notes, fingers stained with ink. The family heads were all powerful – but they were all different. If he did not take those differences into account, they would overcome him.\n\nAs Kalazhil finished the pre-prepared parts of his speech, he glanced at his wife who offered him a knowing smirk in response. “But of course we have bigger problems. Starting with all of with you!” That got their attention. “Spiked wine in the House of Vice from Nymkorai crates, a Vustarin scion dead at a Kattyva’s sabre-tip!” Isermanthi’s spies saw all, and their reports painted a grim picture. “Make no mistake, our city’s future is on the line,” the Bronzewing stood up slamming a gauntleted fist on the table, “but instead, we squabble and bicker while war approaches! No longer!\n\nKalazhil looked around the room at the faces staring at him half in awe. Their king, not their puppet. He smiled wide. “We march together as one – to conquer Taychend!”"
 royakottar_events.0.a: "We march to conquer Taychend – and the families must march with us…"
 royakottar_events.1.t: "Blue Swords"
 royakottar_events.1.d: "Vindar Kalavna awoke to the sounds of sea birds and lapping waves – then to the feel of binds around his wrists, ankles, and stomach. He ached everywhere. His muscles burned when he tried to struggle against the ropes that bound him to a chair. He looked around. They were atop the sea-facing walls of Kottar Orenkoriam, the ocean far below them.\n“No use struggling, Mister Kalavna. The deal is done…” Vindar looked to the source of the familiar voice. It came from an elf counting and inspecting stacks of golden coins arrayed on the wall – twin sabres hung on his back. Seronpan Nymkorai.\nVindar’s eyes widened with rage. A few days ago he had refused an offer of acquisition from the Nymkorai family – clearly their patriarch had rejected that refusal. “I’ll have– my family will have your head for this! If you think this will accomplish anything, you’re wrong!” Vindar shouted with a hoarse voice. “My children–!”\n“Your firstborn’s swimming with the fishes, Mister Kalavna.” Seronpan said in a deadpan voice, still counting his coins. “And soon, you will be too...” Vindar’s heart dropped. But he hadn’t mentioned his other child! If he had escaped, maybe–\n“Pelozhil!” the elf called. Vindar’s secondborn walked into the ageing merchant’s view, unbound and untouched. Vindar called out to him, but the young man couldn’t even bear to look in his direction. Seronpan gestured to the stacks of gold. “Your payment. I trust you’ll spend it wisely – and that you’ll find your new job satisfactory.” Pelozhil Kalavna accepted the money, turning to his father one last time.\n“I’m sorry, father.” He said, a grim look on his face. “You always neglected me, and– and–” Tears formed at the corners of his eyes. Pelozhil turned away, speaking softly under his breath. “I never would have inherited the company anyway. They gave me an offer I couldn’t refuse…” Vindar slumped back in his chair, the fight gone, as his son walked away. He had been betrayed.\nSeronpan, he turned to one of his guards, a wry smile on his face. “Camnan, I think our friend might be getting a little thirsty. Why don’t we give him a drink?” The Nymkorai head laughed heartily; his guards followed suit."
 royakottar_events.1.a: "A moment later, they threw Vindar into the blue sea."
 royakottar_events.2.t: "Ursibadur Vice"
 royakottar_events.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] grimaced as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] walked through the House of Vice, embarrassed despite [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] station. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] could see every trade the Ursibadurs dabbled in as he passed through the halls filled with scantily clad elven dancers and courtesans, packed gambling tables, drunken patrons stumbling from bar to bar. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finally reached the office of Evindash Ursibadur, the family patriarch, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] found the man reclined on a gilded chair, boots up on a desk of Effelai wood, crumpling its golden-threaded covering cloth. He smiled warmly as he gestured for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to sit. “How did you find the House, [Root.Dynasty.GetName]?” He asked. “I instructed my family to offer you anything you desired. I trust you–”\n“I wasn’t interested,” [Root.Monarch.GetName] coldly responded. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had indeed been offered many gifts – spirits and White Lelivazha, a private show, a few companions for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pleasure. “Not my idea of fun.”\nEvindash chuckled, offering a nonchalant shrug in response. “Well, I suppose it was a fool’s game anyway.” He poured [Root.Monarch.GetName] a cup of wine; the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] accepted this, at least. “If you were so willing to partake, I wouldn’t need to invite you. Do you know why I did?”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] shook his head as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] brought the wine up to take a sip. The Ursibadur laughed heartily. “I suppose I wonder if you undervalue my family’s contribution to the city. I had hoped to show you at least a part of our value,” he said, gesturing with a free hand as he took a swig of his own wine. “But the Mercenary King stands above, I suppose. So I may as well give you a few words and send you on your way. Tell me, what do you think drives elves to fight, conquer, betray?”\n“Ambition.” [Root.Monarch.GetName] replied instantly, from cultural instinct. “Glory in life and after – apotheosis, a place in the heavens.”\n“Yes… desire!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] was about to protest the twisting of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] words, but Evindash Ursibadur cut [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] off. “What you have just described is desire! A bodily need, nothing holy or sacred. You lust for glory and thirst for divinity just as you’d lust for your partner or thirst for a good drink!” The warlord sat back in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chair with a sullen look crossing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arms. “Soul and body are of the same system, [Root.Dynasty.GetName]. Just as you cater to your people’s desire for death and glory, I cater to their desire for a good time!”\nFor a second, [Root.Monarch.GetName] remained solemn – but as he looked at the Ursibadur’s earnest smile, the passion written clearly on his face, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] couldn’t help but let it affect [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] raised his cup to the patriarch."
 royakottar_events.2.a: "“Then I trust you’ll continue to do so, Evindash. For my people’s sake.”"
 royakottar_events.3.t: "Shields of Ruin"
 royakottar_events.3.d: "Uratand Kattyva sighed, shaking his head. This was supposed to be a simple acquisition, and now the warlord and the patriarch met between their two armies with their soldiers lining up behind them. “I know,” Uratand began, crossing his arms, “that you are very possessive of your territory. But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has given me the rights to this land. You wouldn’t be rebelling against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], would you?”\n\nThe petty warlord grinned. “If whatever is under my city is valuable enough to attract the attention of the Kattyva, maybe I am!” The Kattyva head had half a mind to tell him that he was rather sure it was only a half-collapsed slave warren, but he decided against it. In his heart, he wanted a battle – the Kattyva were founded in emulation of their god-hero, Kadradar the Stormbringer. They scoured Taychend in the hopes that one day, they too would uncover a relic as powerful as his, using it to embark on a glorious conquest. But with Royakottar’s borders advancing further by the day, that conquest increasingly looked more like a palace coup.\n\nUratand sighed, placing a hand on his sword and readying the other to pull his shield out. “Your mother wishes you dead”, he said, deadpan and unprompted, as the warlord’s face twisted with anger, “your troops are ill-disciplined, your loins are barren, and your “city” is little more than a–“ Finally, the warlord snapped – though to Uratand’s surprise, he didn’t reach for the sabre on his back, but instead raised his hands to cast a spell – ready to incinerate his enemy with a fireball at point-blank range.\n\nLuckily, the Kattyva patriarch was prepared. Instead of turning him to ash, the firebolt slammed into his Ruin-Shield. The patriarch didn’t even feel the heat as the Precursor steel dispersed the magic entirely. Uratand smiled, as he charged forward, knocking the petty warlord off with the full force of the hunk of metal, before finishing him off with a slash. Uratand assumed a defensive posture in the no-man's-land, as the enemy army charged towards him. His own army – his Vanguard Infantry – reached their leader just before the enemy did. Their line held firm as the late warlord’s levies crashed against their shields. Shields of the past, conquering the present…"
 royakottar_events.3.a: "Just as Kadradar intended!"
 royakottar_events.4.t: "To Uncover, To Unwind"
 royakottar_events.4.d: "The narrow corridors of the Dumran Vustarvach glowed with a violet hue as [Root.Monarch.GetName] navigated [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way through them. There were so many books here from both before and after the great collapse – most useless, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was told – that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could barely comprehend it. After an hour of searching, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finally found his target – Arichana Vustarin, the matriarch of her family, who stood staring at the space between two bookshelves.\nThe matriarch sensed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] presence. “What do you know, [Root.Monarch.GetName], of the time before the fall of the Slaver-Nobles?” She asked, still staring up at whatever she was looking at – engrossed in its detail.\n“Not much,” the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] admitted, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] got close enough to see the object of her attention – a tapestry hanging on the wall, protected by a ward. It looked impossibly old. A flying city decorated the aged parchment – Tacenie, it was called.\n“Then you are just like everyone else.” Arichana said. Her eyes seemed affixed to the canvas. “We were immortal… our eyes glowed… slaver-nobles ruled Taychend, ruled themselves by some mythical empire, from this flying city.” Finally, she broke her gaze, turning to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. “And then it disappeared. Gone in an instant, as the skies darkened with ash, and the world descended into chaos. Do you know what happened to it?”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] shrugged, at a loss. “Nobody does. But… some were associated with it. Liandarha Mudaliar, for instance.”\nArichana turned back to the tapestry. “Yes… those who weren’t on it when it vanished – or survivors from its downfall. There are so many theories about Tacenie – maybe it flew off to parts unknown, or exploded in the sky, or crashed into the ground, surely causing unimaginable destruction. Or maybe they set it down somewhere. Maybe that flying city is out there, hiding, like so much of the past. Hiding, and waiting to be found. We are blind, stumbling around looking for scraps of the larger story.” Arichana stepped towards the parchment, brushing a hand over the shimmering ward. “But all it takes is one chance find… one fragment of the past…” the Vustarin smiled."
 royakottar_events.4.a: "... and all shall unravel."
 royakottar_events.5.t: "Four Becomes One"
 royakottar_events.5.da: "“So we must seek other avenues of trade. To the newly discovered peoples of the west and east, for instance…” [Root.Monarch.GetName] reclined in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chair as Triander Nymkorai explained the finer details of imperial trade policy. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] couldn’t help but be a little suspicious, as he talked of increasing Royakottari investments in various cities or sending trading expeditions to the west, no doubt staffed with Nymkorai merchants.\nJalinpan Ursibadur’s intervention calmed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nerves, though. “And if we were to attract travellers and merchants from these places… well, my family’s stocks of White Lelivazha are great… me and Triander have come to an agreement…” [Root.Monarch.GetName] couldn’t help but smile as the Ursibadur and Nymkorai spoke – worked together – for the good of themselves, sure, but also the good of Royakottar. Once, the Nymkorai were spiking the House of Vice’s wine – but things were different now.\nAfter Jalinpan and Triander had finished making their point, [Root.Monarch.GetName] accepted their proposals with feigned indifference. It was time for the others to speak. Elrandar Kattyva made a report on the excavations of the citadel – progress on uncovering some newly discovered storage facility, reports on incidents involving workers and scavengers – and the ever-expanding operations across Taychend. Arichanna Vustarin piped in whenever she felt Elrandar was glossing over the historical or scientific implications for their finds. The two families had always had common interests, but for centuries those interests had led them to conflict, not cooperation. Now they were eagerly working on projects together, with Kattyva scrap flowing into Vustarin laboratories unrestricted.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] couldn’t help but be proud – on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own behalf, and that of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] forebears. The Mercenary Kings – Emperors, now – had done the impossible: turned four squabbling families in a divided city into one unified force. And look at what they had done with it! Royakottar’s banners now hung from Clematar to Katelperai, a Taychend united for the first time in centuries. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was at the head of it, but the people gathered around the table stood with him. Four had become one at last. Now, the real work began."
 royakottar_events.5.dk: "Royakottar burned. The Kattyva family originally had a much more sophisticated plan, which involved enough moving parts it made Elrandar Kattyva’s head spin when his subordinates tried to explain it to him. So when their “best laid” plan immediately went awry, Elrandar’s disappointment was minimal. This was far more glorious anyway.\nHe called out again, and the mages at his side launched another fireball volley against the royal palace. Stone and brick broke and gave way, as his men surged towards the gaps in the palace walls. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s men sallied out to meet them – but they were no match for his Vanguard. Sabres met Ruin-Shields, and shattered under their power. Just as Kadradar intended.\nWell, not entirely as he intended – he had embarked on a conquest fuelled by the unparalleled power of his relic, not a palace coup like this. Though, considering their success, the Kattyva patriarch wondered if it really mattered. The Vustarin didn’t give much of a fight after their laboratories were smashed and attendants killed. The Ursibadur had given a good go at it, honourably surrendering and accepting exile back to their old home in Marhed Rayodana. The Nymkorai had been slaughtered to the last man. Now all that was left was the [Root.Monarch.GetName] – and Elrandar could not help but smile as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was brought alive out of the burning remains of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace.\nThe Kattyva’s men dropped [Root.Monarch.GetName] in front of the patriarch – the deposed warlord glared at the patriarch with pure rage. “You conniving, treacherous– fool!” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] spat through bloodied lips. “After all we’ve done–! And you think you can just take it all at the end?!”\nElrandar Kattyva laughed. “Have I not already?” He said, as he drew his sabre and gestured to the burning palace that bathed them in an orange glow. “The way I see it, [Root.Dynasty.GetName], this was always going to happen. We were always the masters of this city. The metal scrap that adorns the walls, your palace, our shields? Our hands dragged it up from the ground, [Root.Monarch.GetName]… we made you, raised you from nothing… and now…” the patriarch smiled wide, as he aimed his sabre tip at the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s head, the satisfaction of victory washing over him. “I think we’ve earned the right to put you back in the dirt!”"
 royakottar_events.5.dn: "Arichanna Vustarin shook her head as she signed her name at the bottom of the parchment. “Exile to Katelperai, protection from further harm… access to the Violet Library and archives of the Mudaliars…” she read out the terms of the agreement as she looked over it one more time, before handing it to the person who had forced her to sign it. “Have your damn paper, Triander. I hope I never see you again.” The Vustarin matriarch left, flanked by Nymkorai guards.\nTriander couldn’t help but feel a little hurt – of all the various treaties and contracts he’d been making over the past few days, the Vustarin deal was by far one of the more lenient. The Kattyva had been broken apart, the remnant families subsumed into more loyal Nakari and Uesrenni scavenger guilds. The Ursibadur’s property had been acquired entirely, with jolly-old Jalinpan confined to his chambers in the House of Vice and his children taken as hostages. And, of course, there came the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Triander looked at the broken elf tied to a chair in the centre of the dimly lit room – the deposed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Royakottar, and old ruler of all Taychend. He had brought Arichanna here so that she could see the alternative.\nThe Nymkorai patriarch walked over to the elf, kneeling in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and raising [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bloody and bruised face with a finger. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was barely conscious. “Did you see this coming, my old friend? I wonder…” No matter now, he supposed, as the patriarch rose and made for the door. There was no need to kill [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] personally – [Root.Monarch.GetSheHE]’d waste away here on his own.\nAs he wandered through the city, Triander wondered what was next for him, for his family. They controlled all of Taychend, the next great unifiers of the region, like Ebenanth or Yodhan or Olhokar before them. What was left? Get rich? Maintain power? Try and avoid collapse like all the empires of the past? He had to admit – that last one appealed to him quite a lot. Digging Nymkorai tendrils into the very earth itself, rooting his family into the structure of the earth. Ruling through fear and intimidation and diplomacy and military might all at once… but that was a question for tomorrow. Today, of all days, the Nymkorai could rest, and think with a clear mind. They didn’t often get the opportunity."
 royakottar_events.5.du: "The Ursibadur patriarch pulled the [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] seated next to him on the dais into an embrace, clinking his cup to theirs. “By all the gods, do I love a good party!” he bellowed, as he surveyed the great feast in the hall of the House of Vice. “Music playing, dancers dancing, food and wine and merriment abundant! Is this not why we live, [Root.Monarch.GetName]?” Jalinpan Ursibadur looked at his captive with a smirk on his face – he was met with pure hatred, and not-so-silent rage.\n“If you think feasts and festivities will make me forget what you took from me,” the deposed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Royakottar spat, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] pulled away from the elf who usurped [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne, “then you are a fool, Ursibadur!”\nJalinpan merely laughed in response, taking a swig of his drink. “Oh, you may be thinking that now, but give it a few years – the wine will wash away the hurt!” He gestured to the festivities with his cup. “Look at my Kingdom, [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty]! It has barely been a day and they have already forgotten!” the Ursibadur could see his own family mixing with the remnants of the others. Arichanna, the Vustarin matriarch spoke to Jalinpan’s son, a weary smile on her lips, as the patriarch of the Kattyva (the new head of the family – as of yesterday morning the old one lacked, well, a head) mingled with Jalinpan’s daughter, his new betrothed. The Nymkorai were all dead, but that was no big loss. They were no fun at parties anyway – and their destruction would secure Ursibadur control of the trade routes for generations.\nThe fighting had been relatively brutal – in the early stages at least, or throughout if you were a Nymkorai. Poor fellows, them. But after the dust had settled, what use was it settling old scores or engaging in wanton cruelty? This was a new realm, a new Taychend! Jalinpan turned again to the deposed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who was still sulking.\n“Please, [Root.Monarch.GetName]… relax! We still have an empire to rule outside these walls, my friend – and if you are well behaved, maybe you’ll even get to see it again!” Jalinpan noticed the [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan]’s cup was empty – he graciously refilled it, along with his own. He offered the former [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a toast with a smile. To Jalinpan’s surprise, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] accepted it – a small smirk appeared at the corner of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mouth. “Soon a new day will dawn,” the patriarch said, as the new and old king clinked their glasses together, “but that is for tomorrow! Today, we feast!”"
 royakottar_events.5.dv: "Arichanna Vustarin smiled as she took in the air of her new office. It was much more spacious than the old stuffy rooms of her family’s underground laboratories. You could never get any peace and quiet there either; the sounds of the excavation of the ruins in the background were ever-present. It was certainly wondrous that after hundreds of years they still hadn’t gotten to the bottom of the old citadel, but it was small consolation.\n\nNo, the old royal palace was a fine choice for the new headquarters of her family – especially when they finally cleaned the blood from the floors. She looked back to the text she was reading, a “History of the Empire of the Mudaliars”, a dusty old tome by Threzarathi Darijita, a historian of the 12th century. She couldn’t help but spot a parallel here to her own actions, as at the end of empire, Geledish Rakulacan slew his teenage puppet and seized the remains of Nakari Empire for himself. There were differences, of course – Geledish had seized the scraps of an empire already facing irreversible decline, while she had seized an empire at its height. \n\nArichanna wondered what she could do to prevent the downfall of her empire. “Look to the past!” was the answer that immediately sprung to her mind. It was why she was reading this book, why she had already begun to order sweeping surveys of precursor sites and potential relic hoards. But did she not also need to look to the present? Yesterday, she had sundered the other families – wiped out the Nymkorai, shattered and absorbed the Kattyva, taken the Ursibadur under her wing, now decidedly junior partners to her rule. But other groups in Taychend remained – the Mudaliars of Nanru Nakar, the Sarihaddhi tribes, the Bloodcloak Brotherhood and the Cennayakuta of Imarchend. Those would have to be considered too.\n\nThe past, the present – but Arichanna knew she was forgetting something. The Vustarin matriarch closed her book with a sigh, as she sat back in her chair. The future… she was missing the future. A new day was dawning over Taychend, one where her family reigned supreme – and no matter what, they must look to the future, or else risk the fate of all the others who had come before them – the old [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Royakottar included."

 royakottar_events.6.t: "Scraps of Steel and Blood"
 royakottar_events.6.d: "The Vustarin and Kattyva seem like natural allies, with the former primarily working with precursor scrap, while the latter focus on digging it out of the dirt. However, there are still places where their interests clash more often than not, leading to much tension between the two families – such as the Steel-Scorched Citadel.\n\nHere, the Vustarin still maintain an interest in direct scavenging operations. Recently, the disagreements here have erupted into an outburst of violence, as a dispute over who had the right to excavate a certain section of the ruin escalated, leaving several dead. Now the two families beg the Mercenary King for intervention."
 royakottar_events.6.a: "Give it to the Vustarin."
 royakottar_events.6.b: "Give it to the Kattyva."
 royakottar_events.6.c: "Divide the spoils between them."
 
 royakottar_events.8.t: "Dirt Naps and Debonaire"
 royakottar_events.8.d: "The Ursibadur family have always had a close but troubled relationship with the expert caravaneers and traders of the Nymkorai. After all, while the Ursibadur may drink the wine, the Nymkorai procure it.\n\nThe Ursibadur have naturally always sought to escape from this reliance, instead seeking independent traders from cities and kingdoms outside the city of Royakottar. Recently, one of these independent contractors have met an unfortunate end, their caravans ambushed and slaughtered by "bandits". The Nymkorai say that they had nothing to do with it - the Ursibadur want retribution."
 royakottar_events.8.a: "The Nymkorai are not as sly as they think they are."
 royakottar_events.8.b: "The Ursibadur should have invested in more security."
 royakottar_events.8.c: "Force a procurement treaty between the two families"
 
 royakottar_events.9.t: "Conflict in the Provinces"
 royakottar_events.9.d: "The Nymkorai and Kattyva both have extensive interests in the countryside. While the Nymkorai "work with" local merchants and warlords in order to expand their trade empire, the Kattyva often find themselves barreling through them in their quest for reklics.\n\nRecently, the Kattyva sacked the petty city-state of a minor warlord, who fought the family over their excavation of a slave warren beneath his lands. This has incensed the Nymkorai, who had captured said warlord in a protection racket of their own. Now, the Nymkorai seek to right this wrong. The Nymkorai are advantaged in this particular struggle, and if we do nothing they seem likely to win."

 royakottar_events.10.t: "A Lover's Quarrel"
 royakottar_events.10.d: "It is rare for serious relationships to develop between members of different families. When it does occur, the Ursibadur, free-spirited as they are, are generally involved. Except in times of exceptional hostility, families will often let these relationships slide - but when said relationship ends with a drunken fight, and said fight ends with an iron quarrel embedded in someone's chest, things get serious very quickly.\n\nThe Ursibadur family claim that their woman had been wildly hallucinating before the incident occurred - that she had been spiked with absurd amounts of White Lelivazha and the whole thing was a stitch-up. The Vustarin claim intentional assassination, that the Ursibadur woman enticed their man in with her House-of-Vice-wiles and then killed him in cold blood. The dispute has been getting quite serious, and if we do not intervene quickly it may escalate further."
 royakottar_events.10.a: "Let the elf who has not accidentally shot someone with a crossbow loose the first quarrel!"
 royakottar_events.10.b: "Hang the woman - everyone knows Ursibadur livers are too strong to be spiked!"
 royakottar_events.10.c: "Exile the woman for an accidental killing, but give the Vustarin compensation."
