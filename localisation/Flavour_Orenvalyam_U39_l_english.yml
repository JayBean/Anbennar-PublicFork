 flavor_orenvalyam.0.t: "The Rise of Silverspite"
 flavor_orenvalyam.0.d: "The High Kavalali eyed the armoured elf warily as he stood in judgement before them. Elrandar Silverspite, born to a Taychendi mother and a Sun Elven father, had risen up quickly through the ranks of the Oren Nayiru, fought for the cause well, and given much in service to it. It was said he had a great mind, for tactics and strategy – but all in the chamber knew what had truly propelled him to greatness.\nElrandar Silverspite wore the Armour of Yodhan. A suit of hulking, blackened armour, it was a menacing sight, with harsh lines and jagged edges. Black-iron scales, interwoven with steel-like plate, heaved alongside Silverspite’s breathing. The Warlord-Emperor Yodhan had wore this armour, 1500 years ago, and used its strength and durability and command over gravity itself to conquer all of Taychend. It was said its wielder could fly through the air as fast as one could fall, turn themselves into spinning, bladed hurricanes of destruction, annihilate entire battlelines with a single devastating charge.\nThough It was said the suit was powered by a dragon’s soul, a far more compelling explanation was that the armour was actually the body of a dragon, its shapeshifting abilities manipulated into plate and scale. Silverspite was clad in Sedamurax, the Iron Maw.\nHe was power incarnate – and he had certainly found his purpose, fighting for the Oren Nayiru. But there were problems, challenges with his ascent. Firstly, he held some vague but evident hatred for the Exemplars, caused by his relationship with his father – there were some in the Oren Nayiru who held the Sun Elves in some regard. Secondly, there were fears that to appoint him as Kamrayakval would be to essentially hand over the entire Oren Nayiru faith to one elf. Thirdly – perhaps most importantly… there were whispers, rumours, conjecture by scholars and contemporaries. They say that the dragon that composed the Armour of Yodhan was not dead, nor dormant, nor docile. They said it made one mad. That Yodhan’s Sickness was not an affliction purely of his character, but that he was poisoned by the very thing that empowered him.\nBut there were his supporters too – those who said Silverspite could give the faith the determined direction, focus and strength it needed to truly fulfil Nayiru’s desires. And, of course, his personal power. To say it was immense would be an understatement – he could likely kill everyone in the room should he decide to turn against them. He wouldn’t be so bold as to do so now, should they reject him – after all, he would still need a faith to rule over. But if the High Kavalali reject him, the masses of the faithful may not."

 flavor_orenvalyam.2.t: "The Silverspite Company"
 flavor_orenvalyam.2.d: "Silverspite felt a surge of pride as he watched his old mercenary company arrayed before him. They were an eclectic mix, he had to admit, but diversity was one of their strengths. Beside him stood his closest officers – the Damerian adventurer Lianne; the Orcish twins, Orthog and Mogru, escaped slaves both; the Violetblood scion Andrellaran; Hackett, the Gnomish tinkerer; the thunderous Dhalikar – and, of course, the Exemplar turncloak, his second in command, his Velara. In the ranks he could see people from across Taychend, Andeios, South Aelantir and beyond. Exiles and adventurers and soldiers of fortune.\nHe had built them from nothing – a small band of adventurers that grew into a force to be reckoned with, and then the advance guard of his united Orenvalyam. With his position of the Kamrayakval came resources he’d never had available to him before – a good amount of them had gone into improving his company’s weapons and armour. While he soared through the air, they would be his sword on the ground.\nSilverspite turned to his second-in-command, Velara. She had founded the company with him – he trusted her more than any other. “Are we ready to march?”\nThe Sun Elven woman nodded, looking over a bunch of papers in her hand. “Our men have settled into their new equipment well, and we’ve got enough supplies to last us a very long one indeed. We’re as ready as we’ll ever be, El.” Silverspite raised an eyebrow at the use of his old nickname – Velara blushed at her mistake. “I– I mean Kamrayakval, my… uh… my lord. Apologies.”\nSilverspite sighed, though he couldn’t stop a smirk creeping up at the corner of his lips. “Don’t bother. El works just fine.” Her, of all people, didn’t need to call him “my lord”. She didn’t believe in the Oren Nayiru anyway – most of those assembled before him didn’t. They were loyal to him alone – and that served him just fine. They would follow him into the infernal planes themselves, if he ordered it. A part of him told himself that he may have done exactly that."
