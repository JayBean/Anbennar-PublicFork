 kairncal_prepare_for_southern_eordan_expedition_title:0 "A Southern Expedition"
 kairncal_prepare_for_southern_eordan_expedition_desc:0 "To the south of Eordand lies an arid peninsula inhabited by the Fograc, a people who long ago rejected the Eordellon faith. These lands would be of little interest were it not for the presence of Precursor ruins. Let us send an Eordan Expedition out, to find these ruins and the knowledge that has been left behind."
 kairncal_convert_the_fograc_title:0 "Convert the Fograc"
 kairncal_convert_the_fograc_desc:0 "The first step of our expedition should be to enlist the help of the Fograc. Although they had rejected our faith, they are our wayward brethren. If we would show them the light of our ways, perhaps they could help us in our expedition?"
 kairncal_venture_further_south_title:0 "Venture Further South"
 kairncal_venture_further_south_desc:0 "The expedition into the Fograc lands has been enlightening but almost disappointing. Their lands are meagre and unimpressive; there surely must be more to the South. For our expeditions to reach their full potential, it seems they must look beyond the Fograc peninsula to the lands further south. Errant sailors describe a land blessed by Spring and Summer, ever increasingly warmer and tropical. Indeed, Kheionai merchants who have ventured into the Sarmadfar from the south tell of great bounteous rivers past the desert. We must mount an expedition and discover what riches lie there."
 kairncal_foothold_in_haraf_title:0 "Foothold in Haraf"
 kairncal_foothold_in_haraf_desc:0 "Situated on the southwestern edge of Eordand, and combining our Selphereg lust for knowledge with the maritime traditions of the Caamas, it is no surprise that we would be the first Eordan to settle the lands beyond the Fograc. However, this land is not empty. The 'Haraf'ne' lay claim to the more arid north, the Kooras in the southern savanna, and some curious mouthless peoples in the jungles inbetween who watched our explorers from afar. Despite their strange appearance, these natives are still fellow elves, and survivors of the Ruin. If we gained a proper foothold in this region, then maybe we could remind them of  their heritage."
 kairncal_urdea_samrad_title:0 "Deagran"
 kairncal_urdea_samrad_desc:0 "In the Ruin of Aelantir, the elves lost their history, their culture, their technology, and their very world. Only in Eordand did our civilization endure, thanks to the actions of the Domandrod Fey. But like the spring flowers after winter, what was lost can be reborn. A wide river and protected harbor, the perfect location for the keystone of our settlement in Haraf, has been found and chartered. It will be called Deagran, the southern light and staging point for all our future endeavours. A grand lighthouse tower shall be constructed, a guiding beacon for all who still live in ignorance."
