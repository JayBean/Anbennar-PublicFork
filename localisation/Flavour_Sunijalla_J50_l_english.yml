Additionally, we might have some fun along the way!"

 sunijalla_three_as_one_desc:0 "Yarikhoi has been haunted by threefold divisions for all of living memory: three lakes, three peoples, three goddesses. These distinctions have only ever served to keep us apart from one another and at one another’s throats. Under one Goddess and one crown, this separation shall be no more. The divisions between us shall melt away under the divine light of our rule, and we will finally be able to move into the future, together."

 sunijalla_crown_kalyin_desc:0 "Without the unity that Kalyin has blessed us with, our continued prosperity would have been untenable in the divided world in which we came into being. It is high time that we endow Kalyin with the proper respect that She is owed, not just as some far-off creator, but as an active monarch over all creation.

 sunijalla_down_dragon_river_desc:0 "As our righteous crusade pushes further onwards into lands unknown, we have come across a most despicable blight in the heart of Haless: a powerful group of individuals known as ‘eunuchs.’ Worse than even the vile republicans of days past, these eunuchs willingly sever themselves from their ability to cultivate a noble bloodline, squandering all the generational honor and goodness made possible through the blessings of nobility! It is of utmost importance that these stains on Kalyin’s creation are purged to the last."

Led by a woman named Saragerel, she claims that she received a divine vision. In the vision, the three goddesses were revealed to merely be components of a greater unified divinity.

 sunijalla_kalyin_the_queen_desc:0 "Kalyin’s truth has spread far past our borders, and swept up nearly all of Yarikhoi in its wonderful revelation. However, the worship of Kalyin cannot be left in the hands of individual faithful and independent temples, but must be enshrined as one of the central pillars of governance. Without Kalyin we are nothing; with Her, we can be everything."

Now, with our hearts aflame with divine purpose, these lands are but one step on a path that leads us to assuming our rightful place in Kalyin’s creation.

 sunijalla_silk_iron_desc:0 "With the realm of Daengun fully under our control, it is now our right as sovereign to determine what to do with it. The people in these territories share many similarities to us: three peoples united under a blessed monarch, standing firm against tribal savages that desire nothing but chaos and destruction. We should invest into these new subjects; with time they will stand shoulder to shoulder with our other subjects in blessed submission to our rule."

Before him stands his fellow soldiers, his countrymen, and several noble families who just minutes before were all bitterly arguing who had the right to rule the new nation. Now, after having been eyed up and down by every prominent noble in the realm, a decision has been made. Aipar served well in the Great War for the Crown, known to our democratic brothers and sisters as "The Splintering".

In the large council chambers of Qarshtuluu, five representatives each from the five most prominent noble houses meet with [Root.Rulertitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to discuss the matter privately. \n\nHouse Seemas, the last royal house of Valralahdi, is known throughout the entire Lakes. They only relinquished control when their Grand Prince was forced to step down in 250AA. House Seemas is famous for their sheltering of thousands of Zabatlari refugees in 109AA under Grand Prince Edvaar, and having maintained both their wealth and popularity within the city of Valralahdi. They would make for a just royal family that ensures the prosperity of not just the upper class, but of all citizens.\n\nHouse Omyyska, a minor royal house of Vahjevgiiv that weathered the slaughtering of royal families through sheer tenacity and ruthless pragmatism. House Omyyska is viewed with both awe and fear by other houses. Their soldiers are second to none, their generals born from the fires of the siege of Qarshtuluu and trained to fight both Man and Centaur from the age of 7. They would make for a formidable royal family, ensuring the military might and dominance of Sunijalla against all enemies, both internal and external.\n\nHouse Hirkine, a minor royal house known for their shrewd business knowledge, rumored to control and manipulate nearly every transaction both fair and foul. Surviving by using their deep pockets to bribe and barter thousands of peasants, they have survived hidden in the shadows of Qarshtuluu for centuries. They would make for a rich royal house, able to command trade and commerce across the lakes for the benefit of the monarchy for centuries to come.\n\nHouse Tieräsne, recently having been founded under a supposed “last heir” of the old royal dynasty of Länkuuhsta. While new, they have made massive headways in gaining the support of the Forge City, and have only been rising in popularity with their innovative and reformist policies. They would make for a modern royal house, able to win the hearts and minds of the common people for the cause of Monarchy everywhere.\n\nHouse Arhunen, a minor royal family based in Akuutengen known for their hard work and naval expertise, have unexpectedly grown in great prominence over the years. Surviving by disguising themselves as common Treasure Fleet sailors, they promise to capitalize on recent years’ explosion of explorers eager to map both land and sea, as well as follow legends of mystical and magical places never before seen by Triunic civilization. They would make for an adventurous royal house, able to astonish the people with endless new discoveries – not only physically, but in science, technology, navigation, and more.\n\n The Time has come to choose.

The horse is our noble steed;  upon their backs we ride into battle, by their speed we can challenge the centaur hordes who seek to destroy all we have built. This has been our tradition and heritage for two millenia, but now it has all been upended. New and fantastical weaponry has been imported from Haless, and is now being spread across the entirety of the Lakes. Black powder that ignites upon contact with flame has revolutionized warfare in its entirety. The firearm is faster than the bow, quicker to learn, and easier to use. The cannon fires to devastating effect against fortifications, and can shred through dozens of foes as if they were made of mere paper. New technologies are being imported and invented day by day, and a new truth has dawned upon the enlightened monarchy –  if [Root.GetName] were to modernize and adopt en masse the firearm and cannon,  she would be able to exert royal authority at will. The true question is whether this transition should be made as fast as possible, or if we should exercise caution, adopting a more gradual and slower process of modernization?

Just as a president represents the will of the public by grace of the governed, so too does a king represent the divinity of all.

Our hosts were surprisingly gracious, offering us their food while taking none for themselves. Over the course of several days, we learned to communicate with them, going back and forth as we taught each other simple words until more formal dialogue could be established. At the same time, we learned of their culture and their people, who had broken free from their "great hunger". We told them of our intentions of research and study, and our conversation with the ogre leaders proved fruitful., After our translator explained our intentions, they offered to house and shelter us for the time being.

A few days later, we stumbled across a tribe of a race of red-skinned beasts. We took a wary stance at first, aiming our guns carefully – however, by some manner of magical interference  all of our men refused to fire due to a sudden “aversion to violence”. This came as a shock to us all, with many in my group remembering dark tales of  thinking back on the old ban of magic in the Lakes and the horrors of the Tyrant Queen. Realizing that we could never hope to win against such power, we quickly opted for diplomacy. Although their tongue was foreign and strange, one Treasure fleet veteran recognized the language as belonging to the Hobgoblins, a race of warriors west of Yanshen. After establishing communications through a translator-chain, they introduced themselves as Hobgoblins of the Eagle tribe. Learning from our experiences with the ogres, we carefully approached, setting our weapons down. Thanks to another noble who made a diligent effort to learn from our previous encounter, we were evidently able to stay in their good graces, as they invited us to speak and rest."

Images of humanoid figures with long ears, ancient and powerful machinery long since broken apart, and murals of battles, wars, people we do not know of. The hobgoblins say there are many more places like this, but that we are lucky to have encountered them, as others are not so fond of outsiders. We must return here, and do even more studies.
