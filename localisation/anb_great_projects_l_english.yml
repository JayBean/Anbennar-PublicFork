It is built on top of a buried precursor structure with hallowed, majestic halls, where massive murals picturing ancient battles can be found hidden in its depths. One can have visions of death here, deaths past and deaths to come. Oddly enough, those crypts are entirely devoid of color."

It is said that they pooled all their magical energy into this artefact, which acted as a ward and kept the nearby lands fertile and prosperous. It was not enough to stop the desertification of the Epednan Expanse however, and when the Sarda migrated eastward, they took it with them. Now, it sits on top of the Palace of Stanyrhrada, protecting the lands, and some argue it is the reason the Green Forest is so lush."

A strangler fig, coiling about a long gone tree. For the trolls it represents predation and destruction, for the hags and creatures of the swamp it is life absolute. As the hags drain its sap, this bleak energy is absorbed by the environment, feeding off the tree as it feeds off the Shadow Plane. Straining at its bindings, should the tree be released the swamp would likely turn green once more, but then again, imagine the power we could have from fully controlling its web of spirits."

The third; the military district. In this district one finds innumerable barracks and training grounds, the officer schools, and the garrison that cast their watchful eyes across the surrounding hills.

The fourth and final level; the Queen's Palace and the administration. It is from here that the Queendom is run; representatives of both the flocks and the non-harpies meet and petition the Queen in these halls.
