 the_necropolis_desc:0 "------------\n Across the river Cotumer from Corseton rises a bone-white limestone cliff adorned with the cliff tombs of the ancient Milcorissian nobility, and atop it the Neratic Necropolis - a sprawling complex of temples, ossuaries, crypts and tombs stretching for miles along the cliff face and into the surrounding woodlands. At its center lies the High Hall of Judgment, heart of the Neratic faith, seat of Nerat's Council and the ultimate destination for bone pilgrimages from all over Cannor. But as vast as the sacred precinct is above ground, the Neratic priesthood ever-vigilant against necromantic defilement, it is even more expansive below. A network of catacombs and subterranean chapels has been hewn into the stone over the millennia, creating a veritable labyrinth. It is rumored that even the Neratic priesthood is not entirely familiar with the full extent of this maze, filled with corseted corpses, some of whom seem to be aware of every sign of movement disturbing their rest."

Originally, it was built by Balgar from the same pale stone as the famed White Walls. However, during his reign as master of the Vertesk Dominion, Venac the Arrogant corrupted the tower to its very foundations, turning its stones as black as night.\n\nThis tower has survived three empires and two millennia, a near-immortal symbol of fear and power. Countless lords of countless different peoples and petty kingdoms have all ruled from the same high solar, sent out the same agents with the same grim purpose: to vanish foolish dissenters behind the black spire’s yawning gates, their names never to be uttered aloud again.\n\nAs kings molder to dust and empires collapse like straw, the Black Tower stands as an uncaring testament set to outlive all, including the upstart Empire of Anbennar."

Balgar the Builder, not content with merely building an unbreakable fortress, saw fit to carve for Bal Ouord a harbor surpassed only by that of nearby Ovdal Tûngr. Tunnels and hallways lead deep into the earth, converging upon a tremendous cavern against which the wind batters and the waves break. Bal Ouord's bowels may have never been host to wealthy merchant fleets, but at the height of the Empire of Castanor, they hosted an armada that saw even the prideful Damerian Republic flinch."

In the high solar, the petty king found the Sapphire Key badge of the Bal Dostan castellans, and seized it as divine favor for his rule. For a time, the reign of the Korbarids was good.\n\nNowadays, their Corvurian descendants have the dubious honor of ruling over cow manure and dirt farmers. Arca Corvur’s vaults are beyond empty, the old Dragon Road that once enriched the Korbarid Kings worn into a mud trail for herding livestock.\n\nRecently, however, strange screeches are heard in the night above Corvuria. The yearly Masquerades, which shrunk slowly over the ages, now seem to never end. The endless feasts of Arca Corvur draw in impoverished nobles like flies. It is strange however: After leaving, the partiers say the best wine in the Godshield is found here, yet no one has ever seen a barrel  leave the palace…"

 bal_vroren_desc:0 "------------\nOne of Balgar's Wonders, the Citadel of Bal Vroren was built in 546 BA by the Empire of Castanor to defend against the Giants and their subjects to its north. Nestled in a natural harbor along the Giant's Grave Sea, Bal Vroren would come to serve as host to the fearsome Giantsbane Legion and as an important naval center and staging ground from which Castanor influenced the whole of Gerudia.\n\nDuring the events of the Dragonwake of 470 AA, centuries after its founding, tens of thousands of refugees would seek shelter in Bal Vroren's mighty walls. But when the dragon Elkaesal the White came to the Citadel's gates, all of them would be frozen to death overnight. Ever since that harrowing event, Bal Vroren has attracted rumors of curses and hauntings and has been left abandoned, with its ruined walls, towers, and keeps serving as grim reminder of the terror that once afflicted Cannor.\n\nSeeing Bal Vroren refurbished and fully manned would require significant effort, and it is so thoroughly scarred and marred by would-be conquerors and invaders that most now believe it can never be fully restored. If even a measure of Bal Vroren's former glory were to be regained, however, it is certain that Cannor and Gerudia would again be divided by the towering, impenetrable heights of the Vrorenswall..."

 bal_hyl_desc:0 "------------\nDuring the Dragonwake, three Alenic Tribes fled pell-mell into the eastern Dameshead. With Gawedi behind, and Damerians ahead, they turned to fight before the noose closed completely. In a desperate gambit, they put Bal Hyl at their backs and armed every man, woman and child. The Battle of the Hyl was so grave that their backline was crushed against the castle walls.\n\nAfterwards, the castellan of Bal Hyl offered vassalage but refused the tribesmen sanctuary. Surprisingly, the Wex played along: scouts had found entrance into tunnels beneath Bal Hyl. As talks stalled above, warriors delved deeper below.\n\nWhen Damenath fell, Wexonard braves boiled through the catacombs and slaughtered the demoralized garrison. In victory, the Wex chieftain cast the Damerian flag onto the pyre of his enemies, naming his conquest Wexkeep.\n\nNow, the House sil Wex rules Wexkeep with an iron fist. The same labyrinth that doomed the Damerians houses both supplies and spies, the full extent thereof known only to the sil Wex line. The descendants of those bloodsoaked braves still man the walls."
 bal_mire:0 "Bal Mire"
 bal_mire_desc:0 "------------\nBal Mire was built in 457 BA, in the marshlands of western Escann, to watch over the unruly Alenic tribes to the west, long a thorn in Castanor's side. Acting as a bridge over the Alen River as well as a fortress, Bal Mire is the youngest and smallest of Balgar's Wonders. Some joke that all of Balgar's spirit had been spent on his other works, but the truth regarding Bal Mire's diminutive size lies in the uneasy ground it rests upon. Raising a fortress in such a dreadful location had been deemed impossible, and that Balgar did so without affecting the Citadel's ability to serve as an impenetrable gateway was nothing short of a miracle – one that secured Castanor's dominion over the whole of the Middle Alen."

It was from here that they would begin their journey up the Trialmount, undertaking the Trials of Castan, and it was from here that many Castans ruled over one of the greatest empires the world has ever seen and will ever see.\n\nAlthough the Great Aqueduct linking the North Citadel to the City of Castonath has been destroyed and the Citadel itself damaged during the Battle of Trialmount, the North Citadel remains whole. If the Court of Castan were to be restored and its halls once again crowded and roaring with life, perhaps some measure of the Empire of Castanor's former glory can yet be found."
 aelcandar:0 "Aelcandar"

The guardsmen fought night and day to rebuff countless undead, grievously exhausted and injured. The stronghold was pivotal for the Free Realms cavalry, offering refuge when the slavering hordes grew too large. \n\nAelcandar’s name resounds among all Wescann halflings, especially the Coppertowners. Central to Aelcandar's fame is Candor Ale, a glimmering pale spirit only brewed in Coppertown copper kettles, and widely loved for its sweet flavor and deceptive potency. \n\nThe surrounding lands are home still to the half-elven Aelcandari, descendants of the original Free Realms garrison. Initially enforcers for Viswall, the Aelcandari have fought and died protecting halflings in every Wescanni war. Nowadays, Aelcandari share much with their shorter brothers, espousing the same love for adventure, pipeweed and good food. Though kin to the smallfolk, the Aelcandari serve a mixed purpose as both protector and jailer over the halflings of Lencenor."

As the main fortress separating The Borders and Businor, it served to keep Businor’s gnoll infestation out of the southeastern Dameshead.\n\nEscandar has famously changed hands many times. During the War of the Sorcerer King, the Wexonard warlord Magda síl Magda was appointed to rule from the citadel, as duchess of the short-lived Duchy of Escandar. In the time of Jaher’s conquests, Escandar was a stronghold for his early conquests in Southeast Cannor. When the Busilari Interregnum led to patchwork civil wars between countless petty kings and squabbling warlords, Escandar was a safe harbor for all peoples.\n\nIn modern times, Escandar retains its original role of keeping the diminished Hillthrone gnoll packs at bay. Courtiers grumble that its garrison should finally wipe out the pests, and be reassigned to better things…"

Strategically positioned to protect North Esmaria and the old Havoric lands, it is famed for holding back an invasion from Black Castanor, giving the Free Realms time to break the siege and open the way into Escanni heartlands.\n\nCalascandar is a name famed throughout the Empire of Anbennar as the site of the founding of the famed Knights Magnificent and the original headquarters of the Calasanni Trading Company. Calasandur himself ruled from this fortress as founder of the affluent House of Silcalas, one of the brightest and most fecund Silver families of the Empire.\n\nNowadays, Calascandar still safeguards the Ainsway, an immensely profitable trade route, but the CLSTC has since moved their headquarters to Damescrown.

Its outward center is a spacious plaza on the roof of its central wing that is situated in front of a pair of massive bronze gates sealing the cave from which, according to legend, the golden dragon Balris once emerged.\n\nBehind these gates, the cave has been turned into a massive entrance hall decorated with countless murals and ornamental carvings fit for a draconic god-king by the tireless effort of generations of kobolds. Further into the mountain, a resplendent throne room and living quarters, including a hot spring spacious enough for a dragon, can be found. Beyond these massive chambers and ostentatious hallways, a network of tunnels, cramped corridors, vestibules, and cubicles occupy the remainder of the palace.

This great temple, an old lizardfolk place of worship now dedicated to Drongray, blesses all ships, Vyzemby, and lizardfolk beneath its gaze.

A world tree of sorrow and souls that towers over both the Shadow Swamp and the Shadow Plane. Should one bypass the shambling mounds and twisted fauna, you’ll catch sight of its warped appearance. A strangler fig, coiling about a long gone tree. For the trolls it represents predation and destruction, for the hags and creatures of the swamp it is life absolute. As the hags drain its sap, this bleak energy is absorbed by the environment, feeding off the tree as it feeds off the Shadow Plane. Straining at its bindings, should the tree be released the swamp would likely turn green once more, but then again, imagine the power we could have from fully controlling its web of spirits."

The first; a level populated by non-Harpy subjects. Here humans, goblins and other vassal races reside and work, and it is also the primary trading hub of the roost. The second; harpy residences.  This predominantly consists of housing unwalled to the open air, allowing for easy access from the skies, with wide platforms providing ease of use for both harpies and their mates. The third; the military district. In this district one finds innumerable barracks and training grounds, the officer schools, and the garrison that cast their watchful eyes across the surrounding hills. From the skies, they can monitor for miles in every direction for threat, harassing enemy movements with easy retreat in the case of danger. The fourth and final level; the Queen's Palace and the administration. It is from here that the Queendom is run; representatives of both the flocks and the non-harpies meet and petition the Queen in these halls. This level also serves as the housing of the Matriarch and their family. All of the Queen's children born here have the chance of one day rising to the very top of the Queendom, should they be lucky enough to gain the Matriarch's favor."

It was one of many palaces created and held by the giants, until the mighty Storm Queens overthrew them with the help of the Fangaulan king Aro. After expelling the giants from Akasik, the Storm Queens reshaped the once unassuming palace into the greatest in North Sarhal; the mountains themselves were molded to form new chambers of the palace and grant it the eternal embrace of the mother. The Storm Queens brought forth many fresh springs from the earth to create wondrous gardens and an ever-running hydraulic system, and set in place powerful enchantments that still stir spring breezes through the many open spaces of the palace. While before the splintering of Akasik the palace was the primary court of many kings and queens, in recent times it has served as a pilgrimage site for the faithful and the planetouched of Akasik, bringing a semblance of centralization to an otherwise splintered faith."

Here they come together from all over Fangaula and beyond in yearly gatherings to share tales from distant lands and novel songs. The walls of the main assembly hall are decorated by murals depicting famous tales from Fangaulan myths, made from precious wood and iridescent pearl inlays created out of Makans gift, large freshwater river pearls found in the Nkolonnin river. \n\nThe Tree of Tales is however not only a place of learning for the next generation of Jelli, but also the final resting place for many Jelli, particularly those of Kaino descent. The outermost branches of the Yirisunsiir are covered in scaffolds used for air burials. Once their remains have been stripped of all flesh they are cremated and the ashes strewn into Makans pool, a sacred wellspring at the base of the tree, whose waters flow into the mighty Nkolonnin, allowing the souls of the Jelli to continue traveling even after death."

Built into the side of Gleti Sedara, from here Zenidir was able to both survey the land in the area and host his nobles for various purposes, be that the government of the kingdom or simple entertainment. The most famous of its offerings was its izenwez (‘shepherd's-ball’) pit. Izenwez is played by two teams of seven men armed with shepherds crooks, using them to whip a fist sized colored ball made of hard calf skin into a small alcove on the opposite side of a long stone pit. In the centuries since the collapse of his empire, much has been looted, leaving nothing more than an empty husk used in a limited capacity by local shepards.

Within its walls he vigorously researched methods of transmutation and abjuration, becoming the foremost master in the region if not the continent. Its walls sit filled with stone tablets covered in research and notes on the application and study of the various schools of magic, though the most impressive of objects sits unfinished within the central tower. “E Yayerneta Shema”, the Weather Weaver, is an unfinished loom almost the height of the tower that was supposed to be Azmera's magnum opus, and would have allowed him to exert extremely fine control of field and weather spells. Even in its unfinished state, it massively speeds the production of the metal infused cloth for which the city is famous.
