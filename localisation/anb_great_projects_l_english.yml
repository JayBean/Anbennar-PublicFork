Originally, it was built by Balgar from the same pale stone as the famed White Walls. However, during his reign as master of the Vertesk Dominion, Venac the Arrogant corrupted the tower to its very foundations, turning its stones as black as night.\n\nThis tower has survived three empires and two millennia, a near-immortal symbol of fear and power. Countless lords of countless different peoples and petty kingdoms have all ruled from the same high solar, sent out the same agents with the same grim purpose: to vanish foolish dissenters behind the black spire’s yawning gates, their names never to be uttered aloud again.\n\nAs kings molder to dust and empires collapse like straw, the Black Tower stands as an uncaring testament set to outlive all, including the upstart Empire of Anbennar."

In the high solar, the petty king found the Sapphire Key badge of the Bal Dostan castellans, and seized it as divine favor for his rule. For a time, the reign of the Korbarids was good.\n\nNowadays, their Corvurian descendants have the dubious honor of ruling over cow manure and dirt farmers. Arca Corvur’s vaults are beyond empty, the old Dragon Road that once enriched the Korbarid Kings worn into a mud trail for herding livestock.\n\nRecently, however, strange screeches are heard in the night above Corvuria. The yearly Masquerades, which shrunk slowly over the ages, now seem to never end. The endless feasts of Arca Corvur draw in impoverished nobles like flies. It is strange however: After leaving, the partiers say the best wine in the Godshield is found here, yet no one has ever seen a barrel  leave the palace…"

With Gawedi behind, and Damerians ahead, they turned to fight before the noose closed completely. In a desperate gambit, they put Bal Hyl at their backs and armed every man, woman and child. The Battle of the Hyl was so grave that their backline was crushed against the castle walls.\n\nAfterwards, the castellan of Bal Hyl offered vassalage but refused the tribesmen sanctuary. Surprisingly, the Wex played along: scouts had found entrance into tunnels beneath Bal Hyl. As talks stalled above, warriors delved deeper below.\n\nWhen Damenath fell, Wexonard braves boiled through the catacombs and slaughtered the demoralized garrison. In victory, the Wex chieftain cast the Damerian flag onto the pyre of his enemies, naming his conquest Wexkeep.\n\nNow, the House sil Wex rules Wexkeep with an iron fist. The same labyrinth that doomed the Damerians houses both supplies and spies, the full extent thereof known only to the sil Wex line. The descendants of those bloodsoaked braves still man the walls."

The guardsmen fought night and day to rebuff countless undead, grievously exhausted and injured. The stronghold was pivotal for the Free Realms cavalry, offering refuge when the slavering hordes grew too large. \n\nAelcandar’s name resounds among all Wescann halflings, especially the Coppertowners. Central to Aelcandar's fame is Candor Ale, a glimmering pale spirit only brewed in Coppertown copper kettles, and widely loved for its sweet flavor and deceptive potency. \n\nThe surrounding lands are home still to the half-elven Aelcandari, descendants of the original Free Realms garrison. Initially enforcers for Viswall, the Aelcandari have fought and died protecting halflings in every Wescanni war. Nowadays, Aelcandari share much with their shorter brothers, espousing the same love for adventure, pipeweed and good food. Though kin to the smallfolk, the Aelcandari serve a mixed purpose as both protector and jailer over the halflings of Lencenor."

During the War of the Sorcerer King, the Wexonard warlord Magda síl Magda was appointed to rule from the citadel, as duchess of the short-lived Duchy of Escandar. In the time of Jaher’s conquests, Escandar was a stronghold for his early conquests in Southeast Cannor. When the Busilari Interregnum led to patchwork civil wars between countless petty kings and squabbling warlords, Escandar was a safe harbor for all peoples.\n\nIn modern times, Escandar retains its original role of keeping the diminished Hillthrone gnoll packs at bay.

Strategically positioned to protect North Esmaria and the old Havoric lands, it is famed for holding back an invasion from Black Kastanor, giving the Free Realms time to break the siege and open the way into Escanni heartlands.\n\nCalascandar is a name famed throughout the Empire of Anbennar as the site of the founding of the famed Knights Magnificent and the original headquarters of the Calasanni Trading Company. Calasandur himself ruled from this fortress as founder of the affluent House of Silcalas, one of the brightest and most fecund Silver families of the Empire.\n\nNowadays, Calascandar still safeguards the Ainsway, an immensely profitable trade route, but the CLSTC has since moved their headquarters to Damescrown. The now sidelined Calascandar CSLTC branch eyes the new headquarters with anger, but they continue their duty of turning one coin into two."

It was not enough to stop the desertification of the Epednan Expanse however, and when the Sarda migrated eastward, they took it with them.

The third; the military district. In this district one finds innumerable barracks and training grounds, the officer schools, and the garrison that cast their watchful eyes across the surrounding hills. From the skies, they can monitor for miles in every direction for threat, harassing enemy movements with easy retreat in the case of danger. The fourth and final level; the Queen's Palace and the administration. It is from here that the Queendom is run; representatives of both the flocks and the non-harpies meet and petition the Queen in these halls. This level also serves as the housing of the Matriarch and their family. All of the Queen's children born here have the chance of one day rising to the very top of the Queendom, should they be lucky enough to gain the Matriarch's favor."

Flanked on the north and south by the mountains, the Hero's Gate lies at the end of a long funnel, through which any invading force has to approach as they can only attack this singular, mighty gate. Many gnollish and harpy forces have attempted to breach it, without any success. And every time would-be invaders are beaten back, the gate opens once more, to allow for the trade between the Gold Dwarves and their Mašnsih allies to continue."
