A world tree of sorrow and souls that towers over both the Shadow Swamp and the Shadow Plane. Should one bypass the shambling mounds and twisted fauna, you’ll catch sight of its warped appearance. A strangler fig, coiling about a long gone tree. For the trolls it represents predation and destruction, for the hags and creatures of the swamp it is life absolute. As the hags drain its sap, this bleak energy is absorbed by the environment, feeding off the tree as it feeds off the Shadow Plane. Straining at its bindings, should the tree be released the swamp would likely turn green once more, but then again, imagine the power we could have from fully controlling its web of spirits."

The library itself is just the heart of a massive complex that stands towering above the city harbor. It is formed by the many institutions that have congregated around it through the ages, including a great zoo and countless lecture halls, student residences and art expositions. Its seemingly infinite shelves contain the wisdom of five millenia, and it would take another five to read just the titles of all the works it houses. No field of knowledge lacks a place in the Library, and any contribution of the slightest significance soon finds its way to its shelves. The Library has produced some of the brightest minds of all history, and it is expected that it will continue to do so for centuries to come."

A colossal city built atop one of the many mountains in this region, the roost boasts four primary layers, with access between in the form of large staircases and ramps. The first; a level populated by non-Harpy subjects. Here humans, goblins and other vassal races reside and work, and it is also the primary trading hub of the roost. The second; harpy residences.  This predominantly consists of housing unwalled to the open air, allowing for easy access from the skies, with wide platforms providing ease of use for both harpies and their mates. The third; the military district. In this district one finds innumerable barracks and training grounds, the officer schools, and the garrison that cast their watchful eyes across the surrounding hills. From the skies, they can monitor for miles in every direction for threat, harassing enemy movements with easy retreat in the case of danger. The fourth and final level; the Queen's Palace and the administration. It is from here that the Queendom is run; representatives of both the flocks and the non-harpies meet and petition the Queen in these halls. This level also serves as the housing of the Matriarch and their family. All of the Queen's children born here have the chance of one day rising to the very top of the Queendom, should they be lucky enough to gain the Matriarch's favor."
