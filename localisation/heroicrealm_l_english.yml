 flavour_heroic_realm.1.d:0 "The ornately carved oak doors of the throne room swung open with a heavy thud, announcing the arrival of a visitor. Cloaked and weathered, the figure strode confidently across the polished marble floor, the worn leather boots whispering tales of countless battles. Hands, clutched tight, held a simple scrap of parchment - a royal decree seeking a Hero for the realm, plucked from the dusty notice board of a local tavern. The silence in the court was as heavy as the hero's armor. All eyes were fixed on the figure whose presence commanded respect. This wasn't just any soldier; but a Hero who would lead our realm to glory!"
 flavour_heroic_realm.1.a:0 "Rise as a hero, and ride with courage!"
 flavour_heroic_realm.1.b:0 "That notice has already expired!"

 flavour_heroic_realm.2.t:0 "The Price of Heroism"
 flavour_heroic_realm.2.d:0 "In an age of hardship, the less fortunate are often left without the means to seek the aid of adventurers. Even the most basic of quests, such as the elimination of a ghastly group of ghouls or the banishment of a minor spirit, go unattended. These tasks, once eagerly undertaken by valiant souls seeking to prove their mettle, now stand neglected, a testament to the plight of those who cannot afford the luxury of protection.\n\nIt is said that during the bleak era of Jaher, the Elven governors rewarded the adventurers with "two bags of rice or its equivalent." over and beyond what the quest givers could provide, ensuring that even the humblest of pleas for help were answered. The reinstatement of this practice could inspire a resurgence of gallantry and generosity, reminiscent of an era when no challenge was too small and no reward too modest for those who dared to brave the unknown for the greater good."
