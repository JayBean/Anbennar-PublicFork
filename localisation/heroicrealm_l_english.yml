 flavour_heroic_realm.1.d:0 "The ornately carved oak doors of the throne room swung open with a heavy thud, announcing the arrival of a visitor. Cloaked and weathered, the figure strode confidently across the polished marble floor, the worn leather boots whispering tales of countless battles. Hands, clutched tight, held a simple scrap of parchment - a royal decree seeking a Hero for the realm, plucked from the dusty notice board of a local tavern. The silence in the court was as heavy as the hero's armor. All eyes were fixed on the figure whose presence commanded respect. This wasn't just any soldier; but a Hero who would lead our realm to glory!"

 flavour_heroic_realm.1.b:0 "That notice has already expired!"

 flavour_heroic_realm.2.t:0 "The Price of Heroism"
 flavour_heroic_realm.2.d:0 "In an age of hardship, the less fortunate are often left without the means to seek the aid of adventurers. Even the most basic of quests, such as the elimination of a ghastly group of ghouls or the banishment of a minor spirit, go unattended. These tasks, once eagerly undertaken by valiant souls seeking to prove their mettle, now stand neglected, a testament to the plight of those who cannot afford the luxury of protection.\n\nIt is said that during the bleak era of Jaher, the Elven governors rewarded the adventurers with "two bags of rice or its equivalent." over and beyond what the quest givers could provide, ensuring that even the humblest of pleas for help were answered. The reinstatement of this practice could inspire a resurgence of gallantry and generosity, reminiscent of an era when no challenge was too small and no reward too modest for those who dared to brave the unknown for the greater good."

 flavour_heroic_realm.3.t:0 "Rising of the Heroes"
 flavour_heroic_realm.3.d:0 "From the halls of power, to the market stalls and the floors of taverns, and out onto the wide plains of Shamakhad, the same wind blows. A wind from the north, tasting of iron and smoke. The Chimera’s Wind.\n\nNot even 15 years ago, the Hobgoblins marched down from the mountains, descending on a fractured land. The endless squabbling of the northern realms left them scarred and divided, and they failed to unite against the vicious threat posed by The Command and their war-bound society. So did the north fall, realm by realm, into darkness.\n\nThe march of The Command’s armies seems unstoppable to many, who portend that the three-headed banner will fly over all of Haless, but Rahen’s fight is not yet over. We were weak when the red menace fell upon us - but we will not be weak again. For while the first war against the hobgoblins was the war of princes, the next war shall be a war of heroes.\n\nThe realms of northern rahen are oft called  the heroic realms, a land of adventurers and sellswords, of do-gooders and bandits. For centuries, these heroes served the princes of Shamakhad in peace and war,  and our society flourished when one could strike out with sword or bow, and become a hero.\n\nAnd now, in the darkest hour of the heroic realms, the princes send out the call to arms. The final battle against The Great Command approaches fast, and the yet-living heroes  of Shamakhad will use their final breath to strike true at the chimera."
