Originally a group of nomadic tribes, the §YKhamgunai§! people first arrived on the lakes in §Y680 BA§!. A hundred years later, more humans would immigrate to the region due to raging hordes of §YCentaurs§!, who fled to §YForbidden Plains§! after §YCastan II Beastbane§! burned down most of the §YDeepwoods§!.\n\nThe Triunic Lakes consists of plenty of arable land and some of the most fertile soil in the world, allowing it to easily maintain a population of millions of people. However, it wasn't until the §YDay of Ashen Skies§! that most of the remaining humans on the mainland migrated to the lakes and established more sedentary lifestyles.\n\nThe Triunic Lakes are divided into three cultures: the §YKhamgunai§!

Kings lived in opulence as the people begged for scraps, lords danced in ballrooms as villages burned to ash, and the robber barons squeezed every last clink of coin. But in the year §Y274 BA§! came the beginning to the end. A woman, queen and mage, rose to power. Her path to the throne was marred by blood, and greed. Her wars against the other cities left a wake of destruction and misery across the lands, with spoils looted and captives dragged back to her spires in black.\n\nWhen her ambitions came to light, a desire to achievement §YImmortality§! at any cost, the leaders and nobility did not rise to stop her. Instead, the lords sold out their own people, and the mages happily complied for just a chance at her tutelage. It was the common man, ignited by injustice, who united against her.

Bloodlines ended, and magic all but ceased in these lands. Though many claimed innocence, the trust between the magical and mundane had been shattered. But while dynasties could end, magic seemed like an inevitable force, one which would perpetually remerge. As the bloodlust subsided, the cracks in our methods began to show, a question pierced through the conscience of all the peoples of the lakes: were all mages truly guilty? Could a newborn babe truly bear the burden, the guilt, of its forefathers?\n\nThis question has remained with the people of the §YTriunic Lakes§! ever since.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLake Federation§! is in its infancy, only being formed in §Y1441§!. While there were previous precedents of unity such as the §YAmberpact§!, none were as ambitious or as encompassing as the federation, which attempted to finally end the petty internal squabbles of the lakes. However, this was only due to the recent Centaur invasion, which happened to be the largest and most devastating in Triunic history.\n\nNicknamed the §YGreat Incursion§!, the Centaur Shamans made use of the harshest winter ever recorded by locking the frozen lakes in place and using them as ice bridges, allowing huge centaur hordes to invade, wreaking havoc across the south. The path of blood finally ended in §Y1440§! with the hunting of the last shamans in §Y1439§!.\n\nYou lead a city-state in the north, the primary supporters of the Lake Federation. With the scars of the previous decade still largely visible in the lands of your southern compatriots and missing men from your fields, the foundation of the federation is shaky at best. Be aware of any crises that may come, as many city-states such as §YVahjevgiiv§! seek to expand their own domain for their own greed. Keep tabs on the Metsamic city-states, or the federation may well collapse. And still, its only a matter of time before the centaurs reorganise and reap a new path of blood once more...\n\nThe federation awaits your rule. Will you manage to unify the Triunic Lakes? Or will the city-states burn once more, either by their own hands or under the hooves of the centaurs?"

None were spared or given the slightest hint of mercy. And thus, an entire generation was lost."\n-A Historic Account of the Great Incursion, by Raanu Modsuu (1511 AA)§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nThe Centaurs of the Forbidden Plains are ancient creatures, originally being §YFey§!, having existed on §YHalann§! before the start of recorded history. In fact, the Centaurs today no longer live in their homeland, the §YDeepwoods§! in §YEscann§!, which used to stretch all the way to the §YGreatwoods§! in §YGawed§!.\n\nIt was §YCastan Beastbane§! who mercilessly slaughtered most of the non-human races in §YCannor§! from §Y596 to 569 B.A.§!. Like the §YSatyrs§! and §YGnolls§!, the Centaurs almost went extinct in the §YSecond Great Cleansing§!. However, survivors managed to escape to the §YForbidden Plains§!, where they remain today. Their homeland is no longer recognisable, the majority of the woods having been burnt down.\n\nOn the plains, Centaurs have tried to establish a new homeland for themselves, pushing the §Yhumans§! who lived on the mainland to the lakes, where their descendants have formed the §YTriunic§! peoples.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe Centaurs are typically a quarrelsome race, only having been united twice by §YGreat Caehns§! during their history on the plains. Both times, the clans have refractured due to their defeat at the hands of the Triunic city-states.\n\nThe most recent and most devastating invasion was the §YGreat Incursion§!, which began in §Y1433 A.A.§! and ended in §Y1440 A.A.§! The Centaurs took advantage of ancient §YFey magic§!, with the use of §YCentaur shamans§! and the most frigid and harsh winter in Triunic history. The shamans locked ice bridges in place, allowing Centaurs to swarm over the sea and attack the humans. However, the clever humans found out about the shamans, and used any means necessary to slay them. In §Y1439 A.A.§!, the last shaman was killed and the invasion slowly dissipated as the ice bridges melted, causing the remaining warriors to be slaughtered.\n\nNow, you lead one of many Centaur clans, dreaming to unify your people once more. However, the humans have signed a treaty of unity, joining together in the ambitious §YLake Federation§!. O Great Caehn, you must crush these foolish dreams below the thunderous tremor of hundreds of thousands of hooves. Will you   unite the clans and conquer once more? Or will your wars cause a Third Great Cleansing? Or perhaps you will succeed... only to fall apart as a war lasts a little too long?\n\nMay your enemies tremble before you and lay dying in regret for their savage actions in annihilating your kind. The storm shall never end!"

 string_start_ogre_kingdoms_description:0 "§OPrimer§!\nThe Ogres, along with §YTrolls§!, are the last of the §YGiantkin§! in Halann. The §YTrue Giants§! were one of the original races to inhabit the world, eons ago, but fell in a mutually destructive conflict with the §YDragons§! well before the §YDay of Ashen Skies§!. The Ogres claim that they devoured the True Giants and as such gained their strength and power; these cannibalistic beliefs continue to influence their religion (the §YFeast of the Gods§!) and culture.\n\nOgres have long roamed the Forbidden Plains, though the §YGreat Caehn Neagol§!'s conquest of the central steppes coupled with climactic changes after the Day of Ashen Skies led to the Sandmaw Ogres being driven extinct and the §YFathide Ogres§! pushed to the western hills. In AA 28, with the Fathides seemed poised to meet the Sandmaws' fate, their destiny was forever reshaped by the crash-landing of a §YSky Giant Fortress§! into their hills. The inhabitants had perished, and the Ogres gladly feasted on their corpses, regaining their strength and allowing them to survive the long famine years. The chief of the Gravelhide clan, §YGhornma Gravelhide§!, subjugated all the other clans that flocked to the ruins, and formed the kingdom of Maghargma.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nFor centuries, the dominant Ogre Kingdom has remained §YMaghargma§! in the south, which makes its capital in the old Sky Giant fortress. In its prime the Kingdom extorted tribute from dozens of other §YGreat Clans§!, along with a plethora of Centaur tribes who brought slaves and food in return for boons of iron and steel. The northern tribes, however, have remained rebellious ever since AA 125, when §YRoghrin Gravelhide§!'s rivals fled there following his victory in the §YMaghargma civil war§!. The states closer to Maghargma's power base remain loyal, though some of the outlying Great Clans merely pay lip service to their sovereign.\n\nIn 1440, however, the same Centaur invasion that forced the §YTriunic Peoples§! in the East to unify into the §YLake Federation§! in defense also struck westward, and slew Maghargma's ruler Borigg Gravelhide in battle. His son §YZiltagh Gravelhide§! seized the throne, but he was not another in the long line of Maghargma's rulers who were content to merely sit on their throne and eat. A massive ogre, who crushed centaurs whole with a single blow during his counteroffensive against the Hordes' incursion, his rise has been a check to any rebellious tendencies amongst other Ogres.\n\nStill, every Ogre knows one truth above all: the world is eat or be eaten. Will Ziltagh be able to re-establish Maghargma's dominance, quite literally devour the Forbidden Plains, and even crown himself §YMengurkha§!, ruler of all Ogres? Or will one of their vassals consume the fading state and take up its mantle? Or shall it be one of the §YWild Clans§! in the North, who look south with a blend of fear and ambition and wait for the chance to take a bite—or several—of their own, that shall claim dominance and form §YSurkokli§!? The future of the Ogres, and of the entire Forbidden Plains, is up to you."

Originally practicing a form of religious monolatry in which they believed that a great many deities existed, but were intrisnically tied to the lands, regions, and biomes of the earth, the centaurs felt forced to find shelter in a new deity after they were expelled from the ruined and burning lands of their previous deity, the archfey Rohibos. Irdaeos, their new deity, was believed by the shamans to be the god of the wide steppes and deserts of the plains, but also of the sky, the clouds, the wind, and the inherent movement in all things. In the mythos, Irdaeos had witnessed the plight of the centaur's exodus and admired their struggle and perseverence, and thus bestowed upon them a gift; A new land for them to reside in, and a new home to replace the one they lost. It is believed that it was Irdaeos who looked upon the centaurs and guided them to the steppes and granted all the lands within it to centaurkind. The worship of Irdaeos is amongst the things that unites nearly all of centaurkind, but it is not a centralized religion and there is no main authority deciding matters of faith for all centaurs; instead, interpreting faith is left up to the shamans of each individual clan, ordsiakar, or Caehnate. However most shamans subscribe to one of four major strings of religious thought, or sects of the faith. diverging over thousands of years, the differing sects tend to differ for the most part on how they answer one of the greatest theological questions for those who practice the faith; It is understood by all, that Irdaeos rewards those centaurs who have honored his gift and shown thanks to him in life, with entry to the paradise of Ik Maghtaal in the afterlife. The burning question is: how exactly are practitioners expected to show thanks to irdaeos and honor him during their lives?"
