    flavour_shalazar.1.d:0 "Irize Starshield, hero of the last war against Ashhama, through whose efforts we were able to take back our city, holds a high position in the ancient city. Rumours say that only thanks to her resilient defence the old kind Itros Moonwarden survived the Ashhama assault. Irize was offered the esteemed position as the king's closest advisor, and from this place she has effectively run the city. The city guard is strictly drilled and vigilant, guarding the citizens from the monsters hiding in the ruins of Old Shalazar. The city is safer than it ever has been in a long time. But many are quietly concerned about how tight the hold of the Shield of Shalazar has become, and are wary of her succeeding the childless king."

    flavour_shalazar.2.t:0 "The Question of Succession"
    flavour_shalazar.2.d:0 "This morning the old king Itros Moonwarden did not wake up. His lifeless body passed from the royal palace to the banks of the lake to be ritually burned, and to allow the soul of the king to leave Halann and join our god in the stars.\n\nHowever, as the flames consume Itros' body, questions of succession loom unnervingly over proceedings.Who will be the heir to the old king? His loyal yet terrifying advisor? Her glory as a hero is fading away, to be replaced with fear and hatred of a tyrant. Cruelty and draconic orders cost Irize a lot of her popularity and made her a despot in the eyes of the people she swore to protect. Yet there is nobody more experienced nor as influential than her in the city.\n\nAs these uneasy thoughts fill people's minds, a snake-like figure approaches the pyre. Zazhar Moonwarden, the only surviving child of the king, and the naga. Two things that are incompatible with each other. Nagas are spiritual guides of our people. They guide our souls, not our actions. A naga, becoming a king? There is hardly a bigger sin. But as his soothing words calm people down, as he speaks passionately about his father, as he speaks about wishing to guide our city, many start to wonder - is it a sin to have a strong and powerful king?"
