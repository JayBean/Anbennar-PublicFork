 flavour_gelkalis.1.d:0 "For a decade now our overlord has shut their ears for our needs. We called upon them multiple times and, in the end, we weren’t even told no, but were just flat out ignored. The Gelakar are a loyal people, but loyalty is based on trust and Birzartanšes has lost ours in the Decades of Destruction as they let the harpies grab our land, subjugated our brethren and then had the audacity to not care. Enough of our men and wealth was drained for their selfish goals but not anymore; from this day forward, we will take matters into our own hands. What can they do about it anyway?"
 flavour_gelkalis.1.a:0 "The people of the coast have proven their decadence, from this day Gelkalis marches alone."

 flavour_gelkalis.2.t:0 "The Fallen Banner"
 flavour_gelkalis.2.d:0 "The Decades of Devastation were a heavy burden on our nation, and many of our men died as we stood loyal to our overlord. Men who are now missing from our workshops, fields, and pastures. Fathers, sons and brothers gone, never to return to their families. Houses brought to ruin and farms now abandoned as shrinking families were left in shattered pieces. Our nation bled dry for Birzartanšes’ ambitions. \n\nAnd in the midst of all this pain and grief, the harpies came. They always have been a scourge on these lands, even after Jaher shattered their reign. But they weren’t defeated, they only waited; and in our moment of our weakness, they attacked. All who remained fought as hard as they could, but without any real help, we lost land and loved ones to the harpies. Only deep in the mountains, where even the harpies struggled to reach, were we able to hold on. They give us a break for now, but we are cut off; and without help, who knows what will happen the next time they come..."

 flavour_gelkalis.11.d:0 "We have finally freed the great city of Aqatbar. This is not only a prestigious victory, as we now control this jewel of a city, but we are able to leave our own print in its architecture, so our victory will never be forgotten. Now in human hands again, it will soon bustle with life, and our merchants are already eagerly preparing to use this gateway to the world to sell large volumes of our cloth to all who will pass through our great harbour."
 flavour_gelkalis.11.a:0 "Let us begin."
 flavour_gelkalis.10.t:0 "The Flames of Industry"
 flavour_gelkalis.10.d:0 "Far gone are the days of simple shepherds herding their few goats, fearing what might descend from the sky, women weaving some crude cloth for their own family and our few armed men ordered around by others ruling over us. We came a long way from fighting for every hectare of land from the harpies, to integrating them as equals, into not only our nation, but our families. Centuries ago we were barely holding on, then we rose from the ashes and became first a bulwark in the hills, then an expanding nation. Our nation grew and became a force to be reckoned with. Our goods, especially our cloth, have become known far beyond our borders. Where we were once  merely a footnote of a nation, on the brink of annihilation in Bulwar’s chronicles, now we are a powerhouse, and the industrial center of Bulwar."
 flavour_gelkalis.10.a:0 "Nothing will stop the march of industry!"

 flavour_gelkalis.20.t:0 "A Plan for Peace"
 flavour_gelkalis.20.d:0 "We have conquered the harpies and defeated their troops, but we haven’t won. The harpies resent us and their loss of power. They are accustomed to their, by nature, matriarchal structures and can’t integrate into our equality-based culture. Their ability to fly makes controlling them a nearly impossible task, and our peacekeeping forces have no overview about dissidents and other subversives."

 flavour_gelkalis.21.t:0 "Raids from the Resistence"
 flavour_gelkalis.21.d:0 "The situation in our newly conquered states isn’t stable at all, and while we knew there was resistance to our rule,it hadn’t been more than some graffiti here and there, some violent tavern brawls or the occasional back ally murder. Never anything nothing organized, but we knew it was coming, and today the resistance showed it’s power, with multiple synchronized attacks on our barracks, infrastructure, and several state officials in multiple settlements. They are still counting the dead, but it looks dire. They made their opening move, now it’s time to react."

 flavour_gelkalis.21.b:0 "Hunt down the rebels"
 flavour_gelkalis.22.t:0 "Defection to Civilization"
 flavour_gelkalis.22.d:0 "Slowly the integration starts to bear fruits. For those amongst the harpies who struggled with The Hunt for diverse reasons, our polygamous family system is a welcome ease for their minds. Finding a partner, not by force and potential harm or even death, but by willing consent is actually a bigger dream in their population then we, and maybe even they, had thought. They still need to grow accustomed to men being their equals, but this will come with time."

 flavour_gelkalis.23.d:0 "More and more our races start to grow together. What were once only a few individuals here and there, now becomes a common sight to see after the first glorious examples. The resistance, however, hasn’t taken this kindly, and sometimes seem to hate the "collaborators" and "traitors" even more than the humans. Reports of harpies getting their wings ripped off because they "aren’t true harpies anymore", has started to drive a wedge though the harpy population. \n\nAnd with each gruesome presentation of their hatred and disregard for their own people, the rebels became more and more isolated. It was only a matter of time until the first rumors and hints on the resistance reached us, and soon we were able to arrest the first of them and start to clear some of the hideouts. \n\nBut today we had great success. One particular group got sloppy and wasn’t able to destroy their decoded communication, and we now know the location of their bigger strongholds."

 flavour_gelkalis.24.d:0 "It’s time to break the rebels once and for all. Our troops are ready to march on their bases, and with some harpies that are now loyal to us, we have the ability to stop them from fleeing in great numbers. The last remnants of the matriarchy, and the forces that want to separate, us will die once and for all today. Let this be remembered as the last day of Gelkar and harpies, and the first day of the people of Gelkalis."

 flavour_gelkalis.26.d:0 "It was a bloody struggle and it cost us a lot of good women and men, but the rebellion has been crushed, and we can now start to heal the wounds it has left on us and the land. For most, it won’t be this hard, as the base was already created thanks to a common enemy. Still, it will be years until it’s truly normal and accepted to see humans and harpies side by side, and likely many decades until the last of the incorrigible either give in or die off. But with the greatest divider of the Harpy Hills behind us, our common future can be nothing but prosperous."

 F26_goat_wool_weaving_desc:0 "While our shepherds and herds have started to recover, much more needs to be done in order to restore our textile industry. Many experienced weavers have died during the Decades of Devastation and many more have gone bankrupt in the chaos that followed. Today many weaver guild halls either lie empty or have barely a third of the members they had 40 years ago. Rejuvenating our wool trade will require a significant investment, both in terms of funding as well as new infrastructure."
 F26_elven_tapestry_title:0 "Elven Tapestry"
 F26_elven_tapestry_desc:0 "Of all the products made of gelkar wool, no single thing is of higher value than the Sarmadu, the flying carpets. Weaved from only the finest of our year´s wool production, these carpets are patterned with embroidery of a special thread, which is created by coloring the thread in a suspension of several secret ingredients and damestear dust, creating wool shimmering in the iridescent teal blue of damestear. These patterns give the Sarmadu their unique looks and ability to be enchanted to glide through the sky. Mages, both Bulwari and foreign, see these carpets as the pinnacle of personal transportation and are known to pay astronomical sums for such a rug. Despite the huge demand, our production has remained small, the production of flying carpets being a closely guarded secret by the sun elven monasteries and mage guilds. This is a waste! We should endeavour to coax the secrets out of them and give us leave to disseminate the secrets of the trade between the different elven weaver guilds, thereby ensuring an increase of production to at least partially satisfy the demand."
 F26_iron_star_over_the_moon_title:0 "Iron Star over the Moon"
 F26_iron_star_over_the_moon_desc:0 "The Kuz mountain range, which comprises the Western most extension of the harpy hills, has long been the core domain of our former overlord of Birsatanses. However, the once mighty kingdom has never recovered from the decades of devastation, and even the ousting of king Arantir by his ambitious and cunning daughter Keladora was not enough to arrest their decay. With Birsartansbar a shadow of its former self, the people have been clamoring for a new protector. The time has come to fully unite the Harpy Hills under the rule of the iron star."
 F26_unite_our_people_title:0 "Unite Our People"
 F26_unite_our_people_desc:0 "The humans of the Southern Kuz mountain range have long lived lives not too dissimilar from our own people. However, they are also stubborn and proud people that see themselves closer to the Bahari of the lowlands than to us. Over the centuries dozens of grievances have built up between our people. Now the time to put an end to all this has come. They need to realize that they have more in common with us, Gelkar, than any low landers. In order to do this, Gelkar colonies will be built in suitable empty valleys, and rebellious priests are to be replaced with more supportive clergy. Soon all humans of the Mountains of the Moon will think of themselves as Gelkar."
 F26_proto_industrial_textile_production_title:0 "Early Textile Industrialism"
 F26_proto_industrial_textile_production_desc:0 "The demand for Gelkar wool and wool products seems to know no bounds. Despite running themselves and their employees ragged, our weaver guilds are not able to meet domestic and foreign demand using traditional working methods. Luckily, constraints breed innovation, and over the years across the country myriads of small improvements have been made by different weavers. The minister of industries proposes we collect and evaluate the most successful innovations and create a standardized template for large scale production facilities. This could herald a new age in textile production."
 F26_the_power_of_water_title:0 "The Power of Water"
 F26_the_power_of_water_desc:0 "With the previous success of our standardized large-scale manufactories and the generous rewards given out to anyone contributing significant improvements, more and more of our subjects have sent in letters with ideas or appeared at our audiences to plead their case. While potentially quite advantageous for us in the long run, this has slowed down audiences quite considerably, and less time can be used to hear other petitions brought forward by our subjects. \n\nTo lighten the workload of the court in Gelkalis our ministers have proposed the establishment of technical colleges in our most important industrial towns. These schools would serve as sites where proposals could be heard by professionals and be evaluated based on the local situation, as well as serve to educate a new generation of civil engineers. Our ministers have also proposed a head of the technical colleges, Magnus Trueanvil, an engineer known as a pioneer for novel uses of water power."
 F26_the_ashen_terrace_title:0 "The Ashen Terrace"
 F26_the_ashen_terrace_desc:0 "Based on Magnus Trueanvil´s recommendation we have ordered the construction of a series of dams along the rivers running through the canyons and valleys of our kingdom. This had the side effect of creating a series of reservoirs throughout our kingdom. Recently our minister of agriculture has been approached by a group of villagers from the villages along the Buranun, as well as the head of our technical colleges, Sharaf szal-Aban. Having visited the villages, while overseeing the construction of the dams along the Buranun, he has noticed the high quality of the surrounding volcano of Gor Burad. It would be great farm land, if it weren't so dry. He therefore proposes a new irrigation system, which links our Buranun reservoirs to the Gor Burad terraces, allowing us to turn this previously barely usable ashen waste into the most fertile farmland in the entire nation."

 F26_restore_the_pastures_desc:0 "Having liberated our old holdings from the harsh rule of the Queendom, we have found them in a sad state. Most villages are depopulated, the fields lay fallow and the pastures are empty of goats and shepherds. Worst of all, the venerable old guild house of the weavers guild in hranapas burned down during one of the harpies´ hunt for "husbands''. This sorry state needs to be remedied immediately. People that have fled from harpy tyranny will be offered incentives to repopulate the villages, select breeding pairs of goats will be moved West to start new herds and most important of all, the hranapas weaver guild will be refounded and their old guild house restored using royal funds. The dark night is over, these lands will bask in the light of Surakel and the Iron Star once again."
 F26_the_citadels_design_title:0 "The Citadels' Design"
 F26_the_citadels_design_desc:0 "While our cities have always been considered fortified, the limitations of our mountainous homelands have prevented us from creating truly massive fortifications like some cities in the flat lands and along the coast possess. However, this might be about to change. A group of military engineers has recently returned from our wars against the Queendom. While fighting the harpies they have become impressed with the engineering of some of the large Harpy dwellings, which are directly built onto and into the steepest mountain sides. They believe that, by making use of some of the same principles used by our foes and some application of minor enchantment magic, we could mirror the effect, but with buildings of stone and brick. They have even gone so far as to propose a new plan for fortified cities built in this fashion. They call their proposal a cliff citadel, and are confident they can turn our cities into fortresses which can stand up to any foe. All they require is our support as monarch… and a bit of funding of course."
 F26_gelkar_fashion_title:0 "Gelkar Fashion"
 F26_gelkar_fashion_desc:0 "During the first Phoenix Empire Gelkar fashion was sold throughout the Empire. Nowadays, while the quality of our wool and cloth is still well known, foreigners mostly buy it as raw material to sell it to their tailors, who manufacture clothing in their home country´s style. While there is significant money in the textile trade, it pales in comparison to the clothing trade. We should therefore strive to introduce Gelkar style clothing to our allied courts via our diplomats. This would require both increasing our diplomatic standing as well as sending out magnificent clothing as gifts for our allies."

 F26_secure_the_western_flank_desc:0 "While we have secured our eastern flank against the harpies, we must not forget the dangers that lurk in towards the sunset. The goblin tribe of Grey Sheep has taken over the valuable pastures and mines around Lake Nasratu. And in Akal-Uak, the embers of heresy and rebellion remain. If we are to know true peace, we need to protect our Western flank as well. Only by controlling all the surrounding mountain ranges will our homeland be able to prosper in peace."
 F26_the_last_charge_title:0 "The Last Charge"
 F26_the_last_charge_desc:0 " When our overlords called the banners to march on Baharkand in 1419, Gelkalis answered. 15000 of our bravest youths marched to war. Fewer than 100 would return. Our abilities as light infantry, honed by centuries of fighting in the rugged terrain of mountains, proved useless against Baharkandi heavy horse on the wide floodplains of Aqatbahar. With our soldiers being slaughtered in the West, our enemies to our east saw their chance and invaded, almost bringing Gelkalis to its knees. Now the time for revenge has come. The wrongs of the past will be avenged. The Bahari will water our soldiers´ graves with their blood."
 F26_the_great_haven_title:0 "The Great Haven"
 F26_the_great_haven_desc:0 "With the conquest of Aqatbar we have taken control of a large and once prosperous trading port. However, our people have no experience as seafaring merchants, and the local Bahari merchants are rather hesitant to work together with what they view as their foreign oppressors. Still, there might be another option. The merchants of the port-hold of Ovdal Tûngr have been traveling the Divenhal Sea since before the elves came to our shores. If we can convince a number of their trading houses to open branches in Aqatbar, this might give us a cooperative merchant class, which, together with some targeted investments, could return Aqatbar to former glory."
 F26_iron_star_foundaries_title:0 "Iron Star Foundries"
 F26_iron_star_foundaries_desc:0 "The quality of our wool is known far and wide, but it isn't the only riches our mountains have to offer. The mountains around Lawaššar and Lake Jorkad are rich in iron ore. Our people have been mining these mountains for centuries, turning the ore brought up into Surakel´s light into iron of a quality high enough to attract the interest of dwarven merchants. However, during the decades of devastation the mines were abandoned, and the ironworks closed down. Now the time has come to reopen the mines and stoke the flames. With the introduction of new mining and smelting technologies, our steel will soon be counted among the best in the world once again."
 F26_shining_topaz_title:0 "Shining Topaz"
 F26_shining_topaz_desc:0 "Since time immemorial the people of Bulwar have praised one kind of gem above any other: the Surbraquari ("Drops of the Sun"), topazes of magnificent quality enchanted with dwarven runic magic to shine with the light of the sun. While in times of old created exclusively in the holds of the seghbandal, a small group of dwarven craftsmen has settled down in the valley now called Peruškam, plying their trade as gem carvers from there since time immemorial, nearly forgotten except by gem traders. However, in recent years their small community has garnered significant interest from parts of Gelkar society. With the advancement of artificery, our inventors have been looking for alternatives to Damestear, and believe that they have found a suitable substitute with the Surbraquari.\n\nAs a result, they have been pushing for an expansion in production, yet the craftsmen would require an immense influx of investments in order to speed up and expand such a time consuming and complicated process.\n\nOnly the crown could provide the kind of resources needed. \n\nThe Sun itself shall power our artifice and bring Gelkalis a new age of innovation and prosperity."
 F26_cities_of_the_mountain_title:0 "Cities of the Mountains"
 F26_cities_of_the_mountain_desc:0 "The dwarves may have mastered the art of building in a mountain, but we have mastered the art of building on them. Using centuries old techniques, new technologies, harpy builders, and the occasional application of magic, we are able to turn naked mountain walls into terraces bustling with life. With the recent explosion of our population, many of our cities are in desperate need of expansion, both in terms of living quarters and infrastructure. Given our returned prosperity, we should not contend ourselves with the expansion of the old, but instead we should build bigger and better than ever before. Let us raise new monuments to the glory of our people, new factories to employ them, and new schools to teach them. Our cities will reflect Surakel´s light, shimmering like jewels on a crown from their lofty mountain peaks."
 F26_freedom_for_our_brethren_title:0 "Freedom for Our Brethren"
 F26_freedom_for_our_brethren_desc:0 "These days ours is a small, poor and desolate land. Yet this was not always the case. A mere generation ago our land was prosperous. Under the benign neglect by the sun elven court in Birsartansbar, our nation was free to grow and develop as we saw fit. The bazaars of Gelkalis and the other cities were brimming with merchants from as far away as Lorent seeking our wool, cloth and steel. Yet it could not last, as nothing in Surakel´s light can. The sun elves are still bickering over Jaher´s Empire like estranged siblings over a rich inheritance and once again those squabbles ended in bloodshed. When our overlords declared war on Baharkand we answered as loyal bannermen. 15000 axes marched down from the mountains. Fewer than a 100 returned home. Sensing our weakness the harpies came down from their perches driving us out of our Eastern holdings. Only the mighty walls of Gelkalis and the Iron Star palace prevented our annihilation. Some might say that we are merely stalling the inevitable, that the fate of the Gelkar is to be plaything of the powers around us, to be snuffed out at their pleasure, but this is a folly. We Gelkar have endured worse and we are as steadfast as the mountains we call home. I, Uman the First szel-Gelkalis, will not merely allow my people to despair in these dark hours. Like Surakel we will rise again and return to our former glory. And Surakel willing, far more than that…."

While it is easy enough for small groups of experienced Gelkar rangers to live off the land, this is not possible whenever we draw together large forces. Other nations use oxen and mules to carry supplies, but these animals are poorly suited to the mountains we call home. Instead our quartermasters have come forward with a different solution. By crossbreeding our goats with the wild mufflons of the Harpy Hills we should be able to create a new breed of goat that is larger and able to carry considerable weight over long distances, and, should the situation turn dire, could make for extra rations. While requiring significant investment, this might be the solution to our supply problem."

These Northern reaches are a wild and inhospitable land full of savage centaurs, brutish ogres, and, if the legends are to be believed, far worse. Invader´s Pass needs to be made impregnable, or the harpy raids of old may seem like minor inconveniences compared to what might spill from the plains."

 F26_organize_the_militias_desc:0 "Unlike in many other nations, the Gelkar army is not considered the main force that protects our land from invaders and raids. Instead, we Gelkar defend ourselves like we have done since the dawn of our people. Since time immemorial, whenever some stranger has tried to conquer our lands by force, it was the common people that defended our lands. Sheperds, miners, and weavers, taking up simple weapons and harrying the enemy in a relentless guerilla campaign until they flee our mountains in terror. These tactics have been instrumental in our survival as a people and nation. With the passing of the decades, we think the time has come to formalize this system. The nabarsad system will organize these ragtag mountain warriors into a decentralized guerilla defense force with local chains of command based around preplanned sectors. This will allow them to make swift decisions based on the surrounding area, rather than wait for central command or fall into chaos with every village fighting its own miniature war."

Too many of our winged subjects still live in primitive cliff dwellings like their ancestors have done for centuries. If they are to share our prosperity we need to help them modernize and give them opportunities to share in our wealth. Recently, one of our merchants has approached us with a proposal. The wealthy merchant Idris  has started to employ harpies in his weaving shops at the urging of his harpy wife. To his great delight they have proven greatly suited to the task, quickly producing fabrics of high quality and with new and unfamiliar patterns based on harpy designs. These fabrics have become all the rage among the wealthy of Gelkalis, and based on their huge success, his wife, Selussa, has drawn up plans for weaving shops optimized for use by harpy workers. They have approached us, asking for the crown´s blessing and offering us a share of the business, for a modest investment into the venture. This might be just the thing we are looking for."

 F26_jorkand_lake_development_plan_desc:0 "Just like our Southern neighbors in the flood plains of the Suran, Gelkalis depends on intricate irrigation networks for its agriculture. Only through the clever employ of water and gravity can the lush terrace farms of the Harpy Hills prosper. Yet setting up these systems in new areas is a challenging and expensive task. As a result, many of our more recently required lands still lack these systems. Such is also the case for the lands around the sapphire expanse of Lake Jorkad. However, some steps have been made to change this. A local engineer , Abella szal-Duzan, has managed to unify a series of local human villages and harpy communities to fund the construction of irrigation systems around Lake Jorkad. With the first promising steps completed, he has approached the court with an expensive plan for the development of the lake shore, which would turn it into a new economic powerbase for our nation."
 F26_shield_over_the_plains_title:0 "Shield over the Plains"
 F26_shield_over_the_plains_desc:0 "As our experiences in Baharkand have shown without a doubt, our way of war is ill suited for the wide floodplains of the Suran. In order to dissuade any aggression from our Southern neighbors, our war cabinet proposes the construction of a series of strategic fortifications along the Southern edge of the Harpy Hills. These new and modern cliff citadels should discourage any plain dwellers that would deem our lands an easy prey. We will be as hard to dislodge from our position as a porcupine from its burrow."
 F26_into_the_mountain_title:0 "Into the Mountain"
 F26_into_the_mountain_desc:0 "While we have become masters of turning steep mountain sides into cities and fortresses, the requirements of modern fortifications stretch even our engineering ability to its limit. With ever larger walls and ramparts to withstand the destructive power of modern artillery and artifice, ever more masons and soldiers to maintain and garrison them are required, which in turn puts a strain on the amount of living and storage space available to hold the people and the supplies which keep them fed and their guns firing. Given that we cannot go wider or higher, our only option remains to go deeper. While we will never manage to challenge the dwarves in this regard, our military engineers are convinced to achieve similar robust underground rooms with a combination of conventional engineering and limited application of artifice. This will allow us to move our powder storage, food stores, and living quarters into the mountain, protecting them from enemy artillery and allowing us to further extend our defensive works."
 F26_mountain_artillery_regiments_title:0 "Mountain Artillery Regiments"
 F26_mountain_artillery_regiments_desc:0 "While the introduction of cannons has transformed warfare throughout Halann, the Gelkar military has long struggled with the integration of this new weapon, aside for the purpose of static defense. Even the smaller calibers are ill-suited for the broken terrain of our nation. They have also proven too slow and cumbersome to be useful in the asymmetric warfare employed by the nabashar militias. As a result, cannons have only been imported in limited numbers to be used in static emplacements along the walls of our cliff citadels.\n\nNow our artificers and engineers seem to have come up with a solution to our artillery problem. By mounting small caliber, rifled guns on some of the strongest goats from our logistics division and pairing them with shepherds trained in the art of gunnery, they have created a system which allows us to deploy artillery across rugged terrain and deliver accurate volleys from unexpected angles.\n\nWhile the first trials have been quite successful, the training and equipment of these new units takes a fair bit of time. Our engineers have proposed the creation of new gun factories and gunnery schools in order to turn these new units, colloquially referred to as Thunderhorns, into an equal branch of the nabashar regiments."

 F26_as_swift_as_wind_desc:0 "While the introduction of pack goats to our logistics trains has largely been considered a success, they still lack the endurance and carrying capacity of regular horses. Now that the establishment of the Thunderhorns artillery regiments has put additional strain on our goat core, we need to reexamine and consider potential improvements to our old systems. The head of our logistics division has proposed the establishment of resupply stations throughout our land. Special grazing groups will be set aside for military use, with adjunct sites that allow the rapid repacking of supplies from tired to fresh pack goats. To further ease this repacking they have also come up with a new standardized packing system comprised of optimized crates and pouches. Implementing this system should give us a necessary edge in moving our armies throughout our domain."

Wherever the Iron Star flies, people of all races know they can expect to live in peace and prosperity by the Grace of Surakel, finding plentiful work within our numerous factories. Humans, Elves, Harpies, and Goblins work together hand in claw so that our mountain top cities continue to shine like the crown jewels in Surakel´s crown. The Age of Smoke and Steel has arrived, and no nation is better prepared for it than Gelkalis."

 F26_secure_the_valleys_desc:0 "Following the reestablishment of the Akalate of Gelkalis in the wake of the creation of the first Phoenix Empire, our lands encompassed all the mountains between Invader´s Pass and the Kuzak Mountain range. As the Sun Elves descended into their petty squabbles, the Firanyan harpies used this weakness to slowly reestablish a presence within the Eastern Harpy Hills. This culminated in the rapid loss of most Gelkar possessions following the disastrous invasion of Baharkand. Now, harpy nests dot the cliffs and mountain slopes of the valley´s to our South, and each year flocks of shrieking harpies raise from them to hunt throughout our lands for new mates. If we are to recover our old strength this must not continue. We need to reclaim the valleys and return them to their rightful inhabitants."

Some in our court have clamored for the purging of the vile harpies from our lands, yet cooler heads have prevailed. Are the harpies not sentient beings themselves? How many of them are our nieces, our cousins, or related to us in a myriad other ways? They are part of our family and we should welcome home, like any family member, and teach them a new way of life, one that allows us to coexist in peace. This will take time and require a lot of adjustment from both sites, but in the end it will be to all our benefits."
 F26_sheppards_and_harpies_title:0 "Shepards and Harpies"
 F26_sheppards_and_harpies_desc:0 "We may have pacified our harpy subjects, but so far we have not found a way to truly integrate them into Gelkar society. Edicts by local governors and temples have not brought the expected success.\n\nHowever, some reports from the high valleys are filling the royal council with optimism. \n\nBeing a shepherd, while an old and noble occupation, has always been a hard, dangerous, and lonely affair. The young men and women often spent months in the high valleys alone, tending to the flocks until far into the night, always wary of the dangers of wolves, harpy raids, and sudden mountain storms. Spending so much time alone, one hardly wonders why so many Gelkar poems speak so highly of the dedication of the shepherds and their deep love for their goats. Yet while one may love their work and charges, it is rarely enough for a happy life by itself.\n\nWhile harpies have often targeted isolated shepherds in their raids in ages past, it appears that some younger harpies have chosen to adjust their traditions with the new circumstances. Instead of swooping down from the skies to carry off any unwary shepherds, they have instead taken to approaching them in a peaceful manner, bringing them supplies and news of the outside world, and if the shepherd proves interesting and to the harpy´s liking, offers of companionship are made. Some couples resulting from such - at first temporary - unions have even proceeded to come down from the high valleys as husband and wife, integrating harpies into Gelkar families as secondary wives. This has led to quite the change in perception of the shepherding profession in some regions, and more and more young men are signing up as shepherds for at least a season or two in the hopes of experiencing this new pastoral love. \n\nThis shift in traditions needs to be supported by the government as much as possible. Our harpy subjects need to find new ways to procreate without the old traditions of raiding for husbands, and replacing this old tradition with a new system that is more accepted by the humans of Gelkalis would go a long way to integrate our harpy and human subjects with one another."

As their armaments will be light and their main duties will be out of active combat, few will protest against such a use of our subjects.\n\nThe second unit, the Umugallu ( "Cliff fiends") will be a smaller force, only recruited from the most loyal flocks. Armed with Blunderbusses and Grenades, they will serve as shock troops and raiders, using their lightning fast attacks and shrieks to disrupt and disorient enemy supply lines and isolated units."

Having taken care of our old overlord and this region may be quite for now, but it is still an opening into our heartland. Should any of our enemies ever land troops in the Bay of Glass, they could march up through the passes of the Kuz into our heartland. This needs to be prevented at all costs. For this reason, our generals propose the construction of further cliff citadels along the main mountain passes, thereby preventing any invasion by sea from marching towards Gelkalis."

While we originally did not have a strong tradition of magical architects, some of our mages have taken to the new challenge with vigor and have become quite advanced in this new field.\n\nSome of them have chosen to delve deeper into further potential applications and have come up with their own proposals for innovations.\n\nOne of the most fascinating ideas are magical bridges, which can be collapsed and rebuilt in moments by anybody knowing the correct pass codes. This is achieved by setting a series of small damestear gems into the blanks, which contain an attraction enchantment. As the enchantment starts, the blanks are raised through the attractive force exerted by the keystones at each side of the bridge. Stopping that enchantment lets the panels collapse down again.\n\nWhile the proposal is expensive, both our magical and natural engineers are convinced the proposal is doable and would allow Gelkar armies and caravans to move through the hills at unmatched speeds."

Indeed, Gelkar products have found quite the market abroad; the amount of wares moved through Aqatbar is increasing each year. This has recently caused some concern among our court. While the city has become a pillar of our national economy, it lies at the periphery of Gelkar power, unprotected by a formidable cliff citadel as most of our largest cities are. Should we ever lose our maritime access due to an invasion from the North, the effects on our economy would be catastrophic.\n\nThey therefore propose that we seize the Zagnabad, a narrow stretch of coast hugging the edges of the Serpentreach mountain range, and fortifying it with a series of new citadels. With these new fortifications in place, Aqatbar will be all but unassailable."
