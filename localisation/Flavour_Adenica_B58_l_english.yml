  # Mission titles and description
 adenica_chivalric_justice_title:0 "§lJustice§!"
 adenica_chivalric_justice_desc:0 "A knight must be a champion of justice in all that they do. Those who are weak must be protected by those who are strong, and those who aim to take advantage of the weak, cast down."
 adenica_chivalric_temperance_title:0 "§lTemperance§!"
 adenica_chivalric_temperance_desc:0 "A knight must be always in control. Of their surroundings, of their conduct toward others, and most of all, of themselves. Temperance extends not only toward drink, but all other forms of hedonistic excess that may tempt honourable followers of Adean."
 adenica_western_approach_title:0 "The Western Approach"
 adenica_western_approach_desc:0 "A relatively open patch of land between forests to its north and south, Silvervord provides easy access to Lake Silvermere as well as the lands of Inner Castanor. If we are to push our ambitions in Escann, this land must be controlled and patrolled by our knights."
 adenica_royal_hunting_grounds_title:0 "Royal Hunting Grounds"
 adenica_royal_hunting_grounds_desc:0 "Every self-respecting Kingdom needs a patch of forest to host great hunts in. The Nortmerewood and woods of Merescker should do nicely, while doubling as a path into the lands of Southern Castanor."
 adenica_stretch_legs_title:0 "Back into the Open"
 adenica_stretch_legs_desc:0 "With the great forests bordering Lake Silvermere under our control, we can finally move into the plains and farmlands of the former Kingdom of Devaced. With our knights now able to roam and charge freely, we must push our advantage as far as we can."
 adenica_secure_flanks_title:0 "Secure our Flanks"
 adenica_secure_flanks_desc:0 "With Adean's blessing, we have expanded our nation further than it ever has before. Yet we must know our limits, and it is here, at the borders of the Deepwoods and the old Blademarcher kingdoms that we can see ours. We must now focus on integrating our current conquests and shoring up our borders to defend them."
 adenica_gaze_north_title:0 "Turn Gaze North"
 adenica_gaze_north_desc:0 "Now that the southern border is secure, we can look toward the northeast and control of the all-important Alen River, which will function nicely as natural defense to our north. Westwall Approach can provide power over a direct stretch, while conquering Cannwood will allow us to patrol its banks further downstream."
 adenica_staging_grounds_title:0 "Staging Grounds"
 adenica_staging_grounds_desc:0 "As our power and control over Escann grows, the unvoiced thought on many's minds is the question of Castonath. As the capital of the once mighty Castanor and the largest city in all of Escann, it continues to hold great wealth and value to whomever controls it. To be able to take it, we first must penetrate the white walls of Inner Castanor and find ways around the natural defenses of Trialmount and the Nath River. Nortmere contains wide open fields that our knights can ride through as well as the old headquarters of the Sapphire Eye, and so is quite fitting as our next conquest."
 adenica_reclaim_castonath_title:0 "Jewel of the First Empire"
 adenica_reclaim_castonath_desc:0 "With the western approach into Castonath secured, all that remains is to take the city itself. Our knights stand ready to storm the city. All that remains is to send the order."
 adenica_adeanic_escann_war_title:0 "Thrust Through the Heart"
 adenica_adeanic_escann_war_desc:0 "Escann has long been the Corinites' powerbase in Cannor. Generations of adventurers and their descendents call her their patron god, and rightfully so, as so many people will always be in her debt for what she accomplished against the Greentide. This does not give anyone the right to disregard Adean's rightful authority, however. We are uniquely positioned to be able to spear this heresy right through its young heart, and we will not fail. Let us show Escann the ultimate truth!"
 adenica_chivalric_conviction_title:0 "§lConviction§!"
 adenica_chivalric_conviction_desc:0 "A knight must be firm and true in his beliefs and actions, for a blade stayed by uncertainty will oft miss its mark. Conviction in the principles and ideals of Adean and one's own goals and actions is paramount for any knight to be successful."
 adenica_chivalric_wisdom_title:0 "§lWisdom§!"
 adenica_chivalric_wisdom_desc:0 "A knight must strive to keep the chivalric traditions alive, passing any lessons on to the next generation, especially as the old ways continue to falter in Cannor with the advent of new ideas and advancements in philosophy and technology. A knight must know how to blend new ideas in while keeping the spirits of the old chivalric traditions alive."
 adenica_noble_knights_title:0 "Noble Knights"
 adenica_noble_knights_desc:0 "In the days of the old Escanni kingdoms, many of the nobility also doubled as true, blooded knights, as duels and other honourable contests of single combat were the most common ways of pushing claims and settling disputes. Though it may take some initial concessions on our end, it will do our nation well to reinstate this type of relationship with our nobility, and push them again toward chivalric conduct."
 adenica_grand_hunt_title:0 "A Grand Hunt"
 adenica_grand_hunt_desc:0 "With Nortmerewood under our control, we can now celebrate our conquests like how the knights did in the days of old. We should host a grand hunt in these pristine forests, left to grow wild after the Greentide wiped almost all human activity in them."
 adenica_shield_east_south_title:0 "Lines of Defense"
 adenica_shield_east_south_desc:0 "All Escann was unprepared for the initial onslaught of the Greentide. Years of settling disputes primarily through duels and the Order of the Sapphire Eye left the land and people sorely unprepared, as forts and castles slowly lost their martial use, becoming more like residences than true fortifications for nobles. Though we revived the Adenican name primarily to evoke the past, we will not make the same mistakes that our predecessors made. We must heavily fortify our border from any possible incursion from both the south and the east. Let us block off Dostan's Way, ever under threat from Gnollish incursions, as well as Oudeben, with its open path to and from the east."
 adenica_demand_chivalric_oaths_title:0 "Demand Chivalric Oaths"
 adenica_demand_chivalric_oaths_desc:0 "With our monarch leading the way, much of our nobility has started following the Adeanic code of honour and chivalric principles. Whether in an effort to curry favour or out of a genuine belief is unclear, but at the very least we can be sure that our efforts are not for naught. It is time to formalize this, and encourage our nobility to take oaths of chivalry."
 adenica_righteous_spear_title:0 "Adean's Righteous Spear"
 adenica_righteous_spear_desc:0 "Castonath, the site of Corin's now infamous battle with Dookanson, is ours. Our duty will not be done, however, until all respect Adean's authority over the rest of the Regent Court. We must use all the tools at our disposal, even force if necessary, to make the Corinites submit. Let us begin by convincing the factions in our very own nation that this holy mission is the best path forward, then turn to our misled neighbors in Cannor."
 adenica_adeans_favored_war_title:0 "Adean's Favored"
 adenica_adeans_favored_war_desc:0 "To truly be able to lay claim and operate as Adean's will on Halann, we must build the greatest army that Cannor has ever seen. By assembling an army larger and more powerful than any other Regent Court country, we shall cement our legitimacy and authority in leading them against the heretic Corinites and Ravelians."
 adenica_glory_to_adean_title:0 "Glory to Adean!"
 adenica_glory_to_adean_desc:0 "It is time to take the battle to the heretics. The Corinite crusaders must be crushed where they stand, before they are able to spread their treasonous falsehoods even more among the commonfolk. And the Ravelians must be stopped before they can spread their mind-poison to the cities of Cannor, where those beliefs find purchase and take root among the intellectuals and artisans of society."
 adenica_adeanic_cannor_war_title:0 "A Cleansing Wave"
 adenica_adeanic_cannor_war_desc:0 "Though we have accomplished much in restoring Adean's authority among the heretics, much remains to be done. The signs of Corinism and Ravelism mock us more the further our armies get from our noble homeland of Adenica. We shall not rest until all of Cannor is rightfully cleansed of its stain upon Adean's honor."
 adenica_chivalric_duty_title:0 "§lDuty§!"
 adenica_chivalric_duty_desc:0 "A knight must value their duty above all. It is duty that binds the fabric of our society together, duty from the peasant and knight to their lord, and the lord's duty to in turn protect and organize his subjects. Changing times and circumstances may alter the nature of duty, but it must be adhered to nonetheless."
 adenica_chivalric_diligence_title:0 "§lDiligence§!"
 adenica_chivalric_diligence_desc:0 "A knight must be no stranger to the diligence needed to follow the other chivalric virtues and for the pursuit of their goals. They must not shirk from long and boring work, nor flee from the first sign of struggle. The land upon which every being depends on is a gift from the gods themselves, after all, and such gifts should not be squandered away due to laziness or contempt."
 adenica_foals_first_steps_title:0 "A Foal's First Steps"
 adenica_foals_first_steps_desc:0 "Like a newborn foal, our nation is weak and unsteady - both in spirit and in truth. The original realm of Adenica, the birthplace of Adean and chivalry, is long lost to the Greentide, its noble knights dead or scattered to the winds. We are but mere pretenders to the title, at least for now. Truly restoring the might of Adenica and embodying the ideals that it represents will not be simple, but we can start by recovering the central plains and fields that once were mastered by the thundering hooves of the horses of our predecessors."
 adenica_restored_title:0 "Adenica, Restored"
 adenica_restored_desc:0 "With the rolling plains of Adenica, Rohibon, and Taranton safely under our control and fully secure, it is time to look toward reconquering the rest of the Kingdom of Adenica's de jure lands. We shall push our claims into the cold and waterlogged north and down to the very foothills of the mighty Godshield to the south."
 adenica_from_lowly_page_title:0 "§lFrom Lowly Page§!"
 adenica_from_lowly_page_desc:0 "Our control over our cores lands solidified, we must now look toward truly legitimizing our rule. The old Adenner people were ardently devoted to following the ideals and virtues of chivalry, something that we must also start to do to the best of our abilities."
 adenica_rebuilding_taranton_ruins_title:0 "In the Ruins of Taranton"
 adenica_rebuilding_taranton_ruins_desc:0 "The original capital of Adenica, Taranton, was one of the most important cities in Western Escann. It played host to thousands of people from all over Cannor, and served as a vital link between the core lands of Castanor and the Dameshead. The Greentide reduced the city to little more than smouldering rubble, however. We must lead a rebuilding effort in the ruins of Taranton, erecting new walls atop old ones and repairing buildings when possible. Taranton shall be rebuilt as a symbol of resilience and respect for Adenica's past, grander than ever before."
 adenica_earnest_squire_title:0 "§lTo Earnest Squire§!"
 adenica_earnest_squire_desc:0 "It begins small. A story or two spreads about our charity toward orphans and the poor, or the bravery that Adenner knights show in battle. These little stories take root, building up, and over time, Adenners and Adenica itself is once again synonymous with chivalry and the very ideal of knighthood."
 adenica_steel_and_horseflesh_title:0 "Steel and Horseflesh"
 adenica_steel_and_horseflesh_desc:0 "With the revival of the Adenican Coursers and tireless training of our knights, Adenica's cavalry has truly become a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, winning countless contests across Escann. We must not be satisfied with just being good, however. We must have the largest and most skilled cavalry corps on all of Escann. Our enemies shall tremble under the weight of our steel and horseflesh!"
 adenica_knight_radiant_title:0 "§lA Knight, Resplendent!§!"
 adenica_knight_radiant_desc:0 "Our reputation as honorable and chivalrous peoples has spread all across Escann, surpassing even that of our predecessors, the pre-Greentide Adenica. Let us finish this path as true sons and daughters of Adean, the very embodiment of his ideals and honor on the mortal plane."
 adenica_reordering_court_title:0 "Reordering the Court"
 adenica_reordering_court_desc:0 "We have proven our worth and virtue in the eyes of the world as a noble successor to the old feudal realm of Adenica, and have even expanded larger than old Adenica ever was, spreading Adean's ideals far. With this comes upheaval, however, as the old ways of doing things start to break down. We must look toward the example of the Regent Court itself as the best way to ensure that we can handle the increasing strain on our nation, and reorganize our court."
 adenica_forge_a_skylance_title:0 "A Knight's Weapon"
 adenica_forge_a_skylance_desc:0 "Adenica was a powerful regional force in Escann during the zenith of the age of chivalry, with its many storied knights able to win duels and settle disputes successfully. No matter how valourous or skilled they were, however, they found it hard to overcome the overwhelming force that was §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§!, wielded by the rulers of the Blademarches.\n\nThough of course that time is long past, that particular injustice stings still. With Adenica on the rise once more, albeit in a Cannor long past the age of chivalry and duels, it is finally time to forge our own legendary weapon. Even if unlikely to even come close to matching the precursor forged Calindal, our nation shall still likely benefit from the attempt."
 adenica_adeans_champion_title:0 "§lAdean's Champion§!"
 adenica_adeans_champion_desc:0 "Time to show the world the mettle of a true champion of Adean!"
 adenica_chivalric_faith_title:0 "§lFaith§!"
 adenica_chivalric_faith_desc:0 "A knight must place the ultimate trust in Adean and the Regent Court, and spread Adean's ideals and principles to those who will listen."
 adenica_chivalric_charity_title:0 "§lCharity§!"
 adenica_chivalric_charity_desc:0 "A knight must provide for the public welfare. They must give back to those orphans and others less fortunate or able than themselves, especially in times of plenty."
 adenica_knights_ride_again_title:0 "Return of the Knights"
 adenica_knights_ride_again_desc:0 "The old realm of Adenica featured some of the finest knights in all Cannor, well known for their valour and honour. To live up to our namesake, we must rebuild and make our cavalry as the very centerpiece of our army. The names of our knights shall become a curse upon the lips of our enemies!"
 adenica_horse_for_a_king_title:0 "A Horse Fit for a King"
 adenica_horse_for_a_king_desc:0 "A knight's horse is an extension of its rider's will, as important as any piece of plate or weapon. It is important for any knight to take care of and form a bond with their own steed. Our monarch shall have the pick of the litter, so to speak, and deserves only the best mount available. Now that the Escanni horse market has stabilized and recovered, breeds of every variety and type are now again available, each with its own individual strengths and weaknesses. What shall be our monarch's choice?"
 adenica_da_strongest_title:0 "The Strongest?"
 adenica_da_strongest_desc:0 "Orcs know one thing, and one thing only: strength. It was Dookanson's strength that they respected and followed through to the Greentide. It was Corin showing her strength by ultimately defeating Dookanson in single combat that led to many of those very same orcs to convert to worshiping her. And it will be us who will take up that mantle next, and Adean willing, put it to rest."
 adenica_heart_of_chivalry_title:0 "The Heart of Chivalry"
 adenica_heart_of_chivalry_desc:0 "With our efforts, the city of Taranton has recovered from the Greentide and has blossomed greater than ever before. Many of our great knights and noble families have already established residences and have made the city their home. We should continue to encourage this process, for Taranton should be the heart of our realm and the heart of chivalry in all Cannor."
 adenica_dutiful_servent_title:0 "Adean's Dutiful Servant"
 adenica_dutiful_servent_desc:0 "The wars of religion are won, with the rightful Adeanic bloc the victor. Battered and bruised we may be, but we have shown Cannor what a nation following the principles of Adean can do in battle. Now, the hard part begins, as the struggle to win over the hearts and minds of the former Corinites begins. We shall be as tireless in this endeavor as we were in battle, beginning with the clergy in our very own kingdom."
 adenica_adeans_favored_admin_title:0 "An Example to All"
 adenica_adeans_favored_admin_desc:0 "As Adean turns toward his new found responsibilities as the leader of the Regent Court, so must we mirror this on the mortal plane. Let us focus on growth, and show the world the prosperity that Adean can bring to his followers. Leading by example, we must become the greatest of all Regent Court countries on all Halann!"
 adenica_to_shepard_a_people_title:0 "To Shepard a People"
 adenica_to_shepard_a_people_desc:0 "The administrative needs of our nation has exploded in recent years as our country has grown. To ensure that every person is taken care of equally and in accordance with the honorable and chivalric principles of Adean, we must fill this gap, especially if we are to be an example to every other Regent Court nation. To provide justice, courthouses and town halls must be built, so that our people can have their grievances heard. And for when they need spiritual relief or guidance, we must be ready with places of worship available."
 adenica_adeanic_cannor_admin_title:0 "Order, Restored"
 adenica_adeanic_cannor_admin_desc:0 "With Escann restored to rightful rule and our own great nation prospering more than ever, it is time to enforce Adean's authority on the rest of Cannor, beginning with our wayward brothers and sisters in Anbennar. We may not be able to prevent Corinism and Ravelianism from taking root amongst the common folk intermittently, but we must at least ensure that every king, every duke, and every other monarch in rule is in power through the divine right granted by Adean himself."
 adenica_chivalric_valour_title:0 "§lValour§!"
 adenica_chivalric_valour_desc:0 "A knight must face down his enemies and fears with courage in hand. They must be able to act cleanly and without hesitation in the face of any danger or pain, whether physical or mental."
 adenica_chivalric_fortitude_title:0 "§lResolution§!"
 adenica_chivalric_fortitude_desc:0 "A knight must be ready to defend their charge at any and all times.

 adenica_confiscate_adenican_coursers_desc:0 "One of the most widespread horse breeds in all Cannor before the Greentide devastated its numbers, the Adenican Courser was fast and nimble, yet strong enough to carry any armoured knight. Now, only a few herds remain, jealously guarded by those powerful or lucky enough to have kept them hidden. Though its role may have been largely supplanted by other breeds, there remains a chance yet to re-establish the Adenican Courser as the premier warhorse in all of Escann. Under our practiced and watchful eye, of course.\n\nThe first step must be to 'requisition' the remaining Coursers from anywhere they may be sequestered away in our nation. It seems that many have been taken and kept by our adventurer-captains turned nobles."

To make the Courser once again a steed that knights in and out of Adenica can feel proud of riding again, we must establish a new breeding program for them. Let us donate our finest warhorses to jump-start the process."

It could not have come at a worse time for us, with Escann still not fully recovered from the effects of the Greentide decades later. Many see the Crimson Deluge as a sign of a brutal war still raging in the heavens above, while others see it as proof of Corin's coronation as leader of the Regent Court as Adean gets cast down for failing his duties as the Court's de facto leader in Castello's stead. No matter the truth, we must do all we can in these dark times to stay true to Adean, and strive to keep our people on the right path."

 flavor_adenica.1.t:0 "The Hunt: Which Beast?"
 flavor_adenica.1.d:0 "Before setting out, preparations need to be made for the hunt. With the large varieties of beasts in the forests, from the magical to the mundane, wildly different equipment, traps, and weapons would need to be purchased for each one. What shall the hunt be focused on? Rumours abound of a wild cockatrice attacking livestock, normally a rare sign near human habitation. There are also intermittent sightings of a man turning into a bear, though it has not done anything harmful yet. There are also the classic options of a magnificent elk or ferocious boar."
 flavor_adenica.1.a:0 "What happened to just hunting a simple elk?"
 flavor_adenica.1.b:0 "The deadly cockatrice"
 flavor_adenica.1.c:0 "The werebear, please"
 flavor_adenica.1.e:0 "How about a boar?"

 flavor_adenica.2.t:0 "The Hunt: Invitees?"
 flavor_adenica.2.d:0 "In addition to recreation and sport, a hunt was also a good opportunity to rub elbows with the attendants, away from the social restrictions and traditions that a court or council carried. There are a few parties that would surely accept an invitation. Who should we invite along on the hunt?"
 flavor_adenica.2.a:0 "Adventurers"
 flavor_adenica.2.b:0 "Nobles"
 flavor_adenica.2.c:0 "Mages"
 flavor_adenica.2.e:0 "Keep it in the family"

 flavor_adenica.3.t:0 "The Hunt: Boar"
 flavor_adenica.3.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] plods slowly along atop [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] trusty steed, senses primed on a hair trigger. The plan was simple: the retinue would flush the boar out of the heavily wooded undergrowth with dogs and arrows into an open meadow, after which the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would ride the injured beast down and get the honour of the final blow. With the protection of armor and with the boar being injured, it should be an easy takedown.\n\nSeveral minutes later, muffled shouts pierce the blanket of silence surrounding [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The boar bursts out of the trees with wild eyes. It looks not at all worse for wear, and is heading straight for [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_adenica.3.a:0 "Spring the trap"
 flavor_adenica.3.b:0 "My steel shall taste flesh, today"
 flavor_adenica.3.c:0 "Turn around and run"

 flavor_adenica.4.t:0 "The Hunt: Elk"
 flavor_adenica.4.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] laughs as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] races ahead of the other members of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue, chasing the giant elk as it bolts off. For weeks, the party had been slow moving, with few focused on the details of the hunt itself when there was drink and good conversation to be had. Finally, however, the party had come across fresh tracks, and the hunt had begun in earnest. After a quick chase, the elk, with its magnificent but unwieldy antlers, tires out, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] is able to run it down."
 flavor_adenica.4.a:0 "That was easy enough"

 flavor_adenica.5.t:0 "The Hunt: Werebear"
 flavor_adenica.5.d:0 "The investigation portion of the hunt is over almost as fast as it begins. Local woodsmen track the werebear down to an old hovel deep in the woods. [Root.Monarch.GetName] enters with just a few of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most trusted advisors, ready for conflict. The werebear sits idly by a fire in human form, seemingly expecting this confrontation. Hands gripped tightly around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, [Root.Monarch.GetName] quickly takes the werebear to task, demanding answers.\n\nThe half-man spins a sordid tale of circumstance. Apparently, he had been bitten and transformed almost by accident, having been a former herbalist. Lost in the woods one day looking for rare herbs, he had wandered into the territory of a particularly ornery fey, who then cursed him with lycanthropy. Unable to find succor in any civilized settlement, abandoned by even his family and driven from place to place, he was finally forced to this very location. After sharing the story, the werebear seems to make a decision. With resignation in its eyes, it asks [Root.Monarch.GetName] to end its life right there."
 flavor_adenica.5.a:0 "Wait! Let the adventurers have a word. Maybe they can provide a solution?"
 flavor_adenica.5.b:0 "Put it out of its misery"
 flavor_adenica.5.c:0 "Try and talk it out"

 flavor_adenica.6.t:0 "The Hunt: Cockatrice"
 flavor_adenica.6.d:0 "As the weeks pass without a single pass at the cockactrice, the morale of the hunting party drops. Turns out, being able to fly away is a fairly good defence against anyone without the same ability. All the time spent has not been for naught, though, as the noose draws ever tighter around the beast. The scouts had figured out that the cockatrice was taking shelter on an old abandoned farmstead, only leaving to find food to bring back.\n\nThe hunting party approaches the farmstead, excited to finally have something to do. Emboldened by the prospect of finishing the hunt, the party rushes into the dilapidated barn that housed the cockatrice before the more cautious members could stop them, hoping to catch the beast unawares. An unwelcome sight awaited [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Instead of a single cockatrice, the barn contained multitudes, likely the brood of the cockatrice. The scene quickly exploded into pandemonium, with retinue members hacking wildly as cockatrices take flight, aiming to either bite or flee. Overwhelmed, [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets nipped through a small gap in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] plate, and panic sets in as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] feels [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] muscles starting to seize up..."
 flavor_adenica.6.a:0 "Do something, mages!"
 flavor_adenica.6.b:0 "Try and break free of the spell"
 flavor_adenica.6.c:0 "The end is near..."

 AdenicaHuntOutcomeBoarInjured:0 "Reading [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares to take the boar's charge head on. The boar, suddenly noticing an intimidating wall of horseflesh and a spearpoint in its path, leaps up, attempting to score a hit as it passes by. The boar's tusks punches through the outer edge of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s leg armour, but [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s following blow strikes true. The boar dies, speared by its own momentum as the rest of the hunting party emerges out of the woods. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is quickly tended to by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue, but the injury would undoubtedly leave a scar."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeBoarHorseSave:0 "Reading [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares to take the boar's charge head on. The boar, suddenly noticing an intimidating wall of horseflesh and a spearpoint in its path, leaps up, attempting to score a hit as it passes by. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s horse, superbly in tune with [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s after years of working together, is able to twist in such a way that the boar's tusks only graze [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s armor instead of puncturing it. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s following blow strikes true, and the boar dies, speared by its own momentum as the rest of the hunting party emerges out of the woods."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeBoarCowardice:0 "Overwhelmed by the sudden sight of the charging boar, [Root.Monarch.GetName] hastens out of the way in fear. The chasing hunters burst out of the trees in short order and are greeted by the sight of [Root.Monarch.GetName] turning tail and yelping for help. The boar, fortunately, gets confused by the situation and stops in its tracks, giving the hunters the chance to catch up and spear the boar to death."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeBoarSuccess:0 "Reading [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares to take the boar's charge head on. The boar, suddenly noticing an intimidating wall of horseflesh and a spearpoint in its path, leaps up, attempting to score a hit as it passes by. Twisting wildly and throwing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear out in front, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is able to narrowly avoid being gored. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s following blow strikes true, and the boar dies, speared by its own momentum as the rest of the hunting party emerges out of the woods."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeBoarNobleSave:0 "Reading [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares to take the boar's charge head on. The boar, suddenly noticing an intimidating wall of horseflesh and a spearpoint in its path, leaps up, attempting to score a hit as it passes by. From the forest cover flies an arrow, fast and true, which spears the boar midair. This shifts its momentum enough that it misses [Root.Monarch.GetName] entirely. The impact of landing pushes the arrow deep into the boar's flesh and it dies there, speared by its own momentum. [Root.Monarch.GetName] looks into the gap from where the boar emerged, and sees one of the trusted nobles [Root.Monarch.GetName] brought to the hunt with a massive bow drawn, giving a salute."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeWerebearAdventurerSave:0 "Thinking for a while, [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally calls in the adventurers. "Surely you adventurers have dealt with such a situation before in one of your quests? Is there any way to reverse the process?" you ask. The look in the adventurer captain's eyes tells you enough about the futility of trying such a thing, but they nonetheless promise to try their best, as long as the werebear is let into their care. Who knows, maybe a returned sense of community and companionship would do the poor thing good."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeWerebearKilled:0 "With pity in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes, [Root.Monarch.GetName] grabs [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword. With a single, powerful swing, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decapitates the werebear."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeWerebearNegotiationsFailed:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] desperately tries to talk the werebear out of its plan of action. As talks drag on and the werebear realizes that it was not going to get its request fulfilled, its eyes fill with wild anger. It starts its transformation process into bear form, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue is forced to put it down before the situation could get out of hand."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeWerebearNegotiated:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] desperately tries to talk the werebear out of its plan of action, going as far as to offering a place at court as Adenica's best mages and doctors worked to resolve the issue. As talks drag on, the werebear's eyes start to fill with hope, as it truly starts to believe. "I had heard rumours of the honor and chivalry of Adenica, but I had never imagined it would extend this far," the werebear says as it finally accepts the offer. Crisis averted, the hunting party cheers, though more than a few seemed somewhat disappointed at the lack of bloodshed and action."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeCockatriceMageSave:0 "The arrival of the mages is heralded by twin booms of thunder, as one member of the tandem team quickly starts loosing her magic at the cockatrices. The other, filling a support role, starts to work his spells on the other members of the party, throwing out buffs and breaking the petrifying spell that had taken hold of so many members of the hunting party. The situation quickly calms down, the young and inexperienced cockactrices proving no match. [Root.Monarch.GetName] saws off the head of the matriarch cockatrice, raising it high, as the hunting party cheers."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeCockatriceFear:0 "The spell soon takes complete hold, freezing [Root.Monarch.GetName] in place. The rest of the party fares no better, individually isolated and turned to stone. Several of the cockatrices only then notice the veritable feast in front of them, and start curiously nipping at the petrified flesh of the hunting party. Paralyzed, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is forced to watch as the hungry cockatrices start to eagerly gnaw at the frozen party members, terror growing all the while. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is about to send [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] final prayers to Adean, the rest of the hunting party final arrives. Distracted and engorged by the ongoing feast, many cockatrices fall to crossbow bolts to the back. The balance of power is soon tipped, and the remainder of the cockatrices dispatched. With many injured or dead, however, the celebration is a somber one."
 AdenicaHuntOutcomeCockatriceDistracted:0 "The spell soon takes complete hold, freezing [Root.Monarch.GetName] in place. The rest of the party fares no better, individually isolated and turned to stone. Several of the cockatrices only then notice the veritable feast in front of them, and start curiously nipping at the petrified flesh of the hunting party. "Must do something to give time for the rest of the party can arrive," [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks. Through sheer force of will, [Root.Monarch.GetName] attempts to break free of the spell. Concentrating entirely on a corner of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is soon able to free and wiggle a single toe. [Root.Monarch.GetName] moves on to the next appendage, and then next appendage as the spell weakens. Each successive part makes the next easier, as the effect cascades up [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s body. Finally free, [Root.Monarch.GetName] starts to dart around the room, distracting the cockatrices the best [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can. Late coming members of the hunting party soon arrive, loosing crossbow bolts at the unsuspecting cockatrices. With the balance of power tipping and more petrified members breaking free, the day is soon won. [Root.Monarch.GetName] saws off the head of the matriarch cockatrice, raising it high, as the hunting party cheers."

 flavor_adenica.7.t:0 "The Hunt: Success!"
 flavor_adenica.7.d:0 "[Root.AdenicaHuntOutcome]\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue eventually returns to Taranton, having completed the hunt successfully in one way or another. As a reaffirmation of Adenica's feudal roots and traditions, it was a grand success, though working through the issues and problems with the realm that had piled up while away was going to be a daunting task."
 flavor_adenica.7.a:0 "Nice"

 flavor_adenica.10.t:0 "A Horse for a King"
 flavor_adenica.10.d:0 "The bazaar, located at the edge of Taranton, was abuzz with activity. Close enough to regular city patrols to at least dissuade pickpockets and thieves yet far enough that more shady marketplace dealings could take place away from prying eyes, it was the sort of place where merchants, including those who traded in horseflesh, could thrive. [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue made its way toward the largest and most reputable of the horse traders in the bazaar, not quite knowing what to expect. There, a wooden stable housed three or four stallions, while several more roamed restlessly in a muddy, fenced off field. The horse trader, nervous, strides up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and clasps his clammy hands in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s. "H-h-how may I help the crown today," he stammers. The two walk off in the direction of the horses, who by now have lazily sidled up to eye the newcomers.

It used to be the most popular warhorse in all Escann, both strong and fast. The Greentide devastated its numbers, but Adean willing, it will recover."\n\n"Ah, the Arbarani Destrier. The strongest horse in Cannor, and one favored by the greatest knights. Somewhat feisty, however."\n\n"The poor Alenic Rouncey. Considered a peasants horse - as if peasants could afford any of my horses! Strong yet cheap, but slow and does not fare well in battle."\n\n"Finally, the Elikhandi Courser, my personal favorite. A cross between the nimble Kheteratan brought by the New Wanderer adventurers and the Arbarani Destrier, it is a great all-arounder for both travel and battle."\n\nFinished with his spiel, he looks at [Root.Monarch.GetName] expectantly.
