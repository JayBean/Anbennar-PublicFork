 #Missions titles and descriptions
 
 #Row 1
 Y66_the_coalition_victory_title:0 "The Coalition Victory"
 Y66_the_coalition_victory_desc:0 "The Yansheni pirates of Pinghoi have raided our coasts for far too long, even going so far as to seize our territories and the territories of our loyal ally, the chiefdom of Jaya Raya, in recent years. This is intolerable, and must not be permitted to stand. It is time for us to remind these foreigners that it is we who rule and they who must obey - or perish."
 Y66_the_solemn_oath_title:0 "The Solemn Oath"
 Y66_the_solemn_oath_desc:0 "In the aftermath of our common victory over the pirates of Pinghoi, ties between ourselves and our erstwhile ally, the chiefdom of Jaya Raya, have grown closer than ever before. Now, the time has come: their chief, [Y76.Monarch.GetName], has proceeded to Tuan Caoban to swear a solemn oath. Under these terms, Jaya Raya shall return to the fold and submit to vassalage once more. They shall be an example to our many former vassals: now, this is true loyalty!"
 Y66_the_coastal_defense_network_title:0 "The Coastal Defense"
 Y66_the_coastal_defense_network_desc:0 "Year after year we get reports of our coastal cities, telling us of plundering and horrible atrocities from the pirates. The trade flowing through Cay Cam Sinh is getting blockaded, essentially blocking us from the lucrative trade routes to the golf of Rahen. We should erect coastal defenses along the shore to block the pirates from landing."
 Y66_the_pirates_title:0 "The Pirates"
 Y66_the_pirates_desc:0 "These pirates are worse than the Lupulan's demon-ants! Crush one island base and two more pop up, defeat one fleet at sea and by the time you're ashore, you hear of two more raids already done. This continued irritant offends the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but our efforts have been lackluster so far.\n\nPerhaps it takes a pirate to fight a pirate. It may be expensive, but if we can pay one of our foes to root out the other, it will be well worth it."
 Y66_the_pirate_wars_title:0 "The Pirate Wars"
 Y66_the_pirate_wars_desc:0 "The sword we have taken up is more of a pirate cutlass -- rusty, blunt, and you're always at risk of self-injury. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] is not merely a good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is a great one, and that entails being able to use even the most inopportune of instruments.\n\nThe Pirate Wars begin. They will end when our foe is scourged from the sea and our coast is secure (our rivals'... may be less so)."
 Y66_the_fate_of_the_gon_title:0 "The Fate of the Gon"
 Y66_the_fate_of_the_gon_desc:0 "Under Baihon Xinh, the Gon were an integral part of the "triple alliance" that saw Phonan, Khom, and Gon all thrive together. But outside it, prosperity has turned to poverty, cooperation to conflict.\n\nWe must reunify the Gon within [Root.GetName]. Only then will they re-achieve the vibrancy of prior days."
 Y66_the_defense_act_title:0 "The Defense Act"
 Y66_the_defense_act_desc:0 "Fort Taibo was our might shield against Jaher's nigh-unstoppable might. Then, in the traitor-son's war, it was an anchor, as steady as the Ghost-Emperor's will. We must ensure it can remain a keystone of our defence for centuries to come, adapting to the new style of a siege and rebuilding its walls to resist even the most concentrated of cannon fire."
 Y66_the_artillery_doctrine_title:0 "The Artillery Doctrine"
 Y66_the_artillery_doctrine_desc:0 "Some rely on cannons for direct military support, their devastation ensuring a charge breaks enemy lines. Others use it more sporadically, to shore up weak-points and turn the tides where their men might be faltering.\n\nOthers, who lack our mastery of the cannon, have to choose. We, on the other hand, can integrate artillery into every part of our military and every piece of our tactical regimen. When our reforms are complete, none in Haless (or perhaps Halann) will be able to challenge our mastery of the art of direct and indirect fire."
 Y66_the_subjugation_title:0 "The Subjugation"
 Y66_the_subjugation_desc:0 "Bomdan: a land of great rivers, great wealth, and great forts. In the name of Baihon Xinh, we will seize all three, and ensure it finds its rightful place in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s domain. This will fully protect our western flank, enabling us to further expand our delicate infrastructure."
 
#Row 2
 Y66_the_reconquest_title:0 "The Reconquest"
 Y66_the_reconquest_desc:0 "When Caoban Dinh took up arms against his father in defiance of all common sense and custom, our erstwhile vassal of Nagon declared independence in an attempt to take advantage of our temporary weakness. We may have permitted this to stand for a matter of years, but this was never intended to be a permanent state of affairs. Let us return Nagon to the fold!"
 Y66_the_unity_title:0 "The Unity"
 Y66_the_unity_desc:0 "Caoban Dinh's rebellion was a momentary but immensely traumatic rupture, splintering three peoples that had once been one. The cultural capitals of Mairuk, Tuan Caoban and Hubai Mong found themselves on opposing sides, ruled by three monarchs who claimed to be independent from one another. Now, though, all three cities accept the sovereignty of one power: ourselves. Let us restore harmony and balance to the realm."
 Y66_the_succession_title:0 "The Succession"
 Y66_the_succession_desc:0 "The sons of Caobang Sang thought to impose their own succession plans on great [Root.GetName], and paid dearly for their treachery. But they were not wrong, that there will come a day where we must carry on our patriarch's legacy without his presence. We must ensure a smooth transition, fully in line with the Ghost-Emperor's will, and to do so we should start planning immediately."
 Y66_the_navy_title:0 "The Navy"
 Y66_the_navy_desc:0 "When that demon Ping struck at Cây Cam Sinh, we watched helplessly as one of our great jewels fell before the sea. We can never allow such a crime to happen again -- fell the forests, fill the shipyards, we will have a navy befitting [Root.GetName]!"
 Y66_the_retribution_title:0 "The Retribution"
 Y66_the_retribution_desc:0 "We of [Root.GetName] know well what it is to be vulnerable -- and then have your neighbours pounce. The rage it inspires, the enmity.\n\nAnd so we well understood the diplomats from Jaya Raya, who sought our aid against the devastating raids they have suffered recently. They will have it, along with all our skills at retribution."
 Y66_the_vassal_reforms_title:0 "The Vassal Reforms"
 Y66_the_vassal_reforms_desc:0 "With the recent conquests the size of Jaya Raya grew considerably, putting a strain on their primitive tribal form of government. They seek to improve the situation by making the necessary reforms. In the last annual meeting they asked for know-how and help in doing so. We should take this opportunity to form their state to our greatest benefits."
 Y66_the_vassal_act_title:0 "The Vassal Act"
 Y66_the_vassal_act_desc:0 "A tree must be served by every root, a river must be fed by every tributary. Just as well, we must ensure every vassal that pays tribute and owes allegiance to [Root.GetName] is properly integrated into our administration. Being able to handle such a variety of semi-autonomous states will require a restructuring of our bureaucracy, but it is necessary for [Root.GetName]'s continued prosperity."
 Y66_the_western_welfare_zone_title:0 "The Western Welfare Zone"
 Y66_the_western_welfare_zone_desc:0 "The west has been secured, but there is no need for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to busy [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] with every aspect of the land's administration. The Daulophs of Lot Dekkang earn their nobility by their skills as a mercenary; it should not be too much work to convince that state (whose tolerant values echo our own) to expand their 'mercenary' role, and act as hired administrators of the region in our stead."
 Y66_the_jungle_wars_title:0 "The Jungle Wars"
 Y66_the_jungle_wars_desc:0 "Twisted root and gnarled branch, strangling vine and impenetrable thicket. These are the barriers to any conquest of the Lupulan, a land where every petty chieftain thinks himself king.\n\nBut now, with Jaya Raya sharpened into a spear, we will pierce nature's shielding -- and show them all what it means to be a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 
#Row 3
 Y66_the_internal_strife_title:0 "The Internal Strife"
 Y66_the_internal_strife_desc:0 "After much bloodshed, the Emperor's treacherous son, Caoban Dinh, has been put down, while his vile northern lackeys have been brought to heel. With the advent of peace, our armies are free to rest and recuperate, replenishing their stores and refilling their ranks. They shall train and drill in their barracks until the Emperor once again requires their services."
 Y66_the_ghost_congress_title:0 "The Ghost Congress"
 Y66_the_ghost_congress_desc:0 "It’s time for us to finally reform our current government to adjust it to our special situation. The estates have sent a list with demands for them to give support to such an undertaking. All they want is more power, who would expect something else? Nevertheless we are in dire need of a reform so we should do our utmost to make them happy."
 Y66_the_reborn_kingdom_title:0 "The Reborn Kingdom"
 Y66_the_reborn_kingdom_desc:0 "It is done! At long last the revolts from both traitorous kin and unfaithful "allies" have been put down and the lands of Baihon Xinh once more know tranquility and the prosperity of just rule. That however is not even the height of our accomplishments. We have at long last brought true unity to our lands as never seen even in the days of Jaher's foolhardy attempts to conquer our great nation. Now we stand as one and we shall see to it that nothing shall ever again shatter our unity. We shall beat back every mote of darkness and show all Haless true righteousness."
 Y66_the_northern_granary_title:0 "The Northern Granary"
 Y66_the_northern_granary_desc:0 "The first step in taking back control over southern Haless lies in the northern flood plains. The region is rich in farmable lands, producing grain, rice and livestock, feeding most of southern haless. Historically the dwarves of Verkal Ozovar ruled over the Kai people living there, while paying tribute to us. Let us not repeat this mistake and free our brothers from dwarven rule and directly take control over the rice fields of southern haless, weakening the dwarves and further isolating them in their mountainous hold."
 Y66_the_dwarves_title:0 "The Dwarves"
 Y66_the_dwarves_desc:0 "Once, we worked together with the dwarves, and they taught us the basics of cannonry. We may have surpassed them in skill using them, but there is still not a cannon that can compare to what they can make.\n\nWhile we have been separated, however, they have grown ambitious, and now our plans are at odds with theirs. Perhaps we can avoid bloodshed with them through a show of force, and a diplomatic request to return to the prior status quo?"
 Y66_the_kai_people_title:0 "The Kai People"
 Y66_the_kai_people_desc:0 "When Baihon Xinh was empire, every Kai paid it tribute, and every Kai was welcome within. We must ensure the same is true of [Root.GetName] today. Our next targets are the Sikai and Bokai people living in the north and east of southern Haless. "
 Y66_the_binhrung_campaign_title:0 "The Binhrung Campaign"
 Y66_the_binhrung_campaign_desc:0 "Chien Binhrung was once a close ally, but... times have changed. Perhaps the ghosts of their past queens gave their current one bad advice, perhaps what an emissary thought was a kind gift was in fact a deadly insult, perhaps even it was a piece of our rise that disturbed them.\n\nBut no matter. The past is past, the present is now. They are Kai, and so they are rightful subjects of [Root.GetName]."
 Y66_the_protector_title:0 "The Protector"
 Y66_the_protector_desc:0 "The time for rebuilding is over, we now stand proud as the most foremost nation in southern Haless. We united the Kai people, defended our shores, reinvigorated trade and are one of the main cultural centers of Haless. The streets of Tuan Caoban and of the other large cities are bustling with activities, selling all kinds of exotic goods. Year after year the vassals come to our capital to pay tribute to the Ghost-Emperor and honor his legacy. The time has come to consolidate our power and look beyond southern Haless, maybe even over the big sea."
 Y66_the_ascendency_title:0 "The Ascendency"
 Y66_the_ascendency_desc:0 "All of southern Haless is now directly or indirectly under our rule, governed by loyal vassals. We have become one of the major cultural centers in the world, known all over the world for religious and racial tolerance, attracting a never ending influx of new and talented people. The stories about the Ghost-Emperor are told to any child as a fairytale. Our economy is growing and merchants from all parts of Halan can be found trading in our cities. And most importantly the prowess of our canons is feared by our enemies and admired by our allies.\n\nMay no one ever look down on us again!"

#Row 4
 Y66_the_omniopticum_title:0 "The Omniopticum"
 Y66_the_omniopticum_desc:0 "Owing to his... unique circumstances, the Emperor has found himself unable to leave his palace. To this end, he has conscripted a number of prominent engineers and architects to install mirrors in his throne-room, which soars above the city of Tuan Caoban.\n\nThis will allow our ruler to survey his city at his pleasure. He has also decided that certain machines are to be installed in his palace to allow him to monitor Tuan Caoban more closely."
 Y66_the_spirit_network_title:0 "The Spirit Network"
 Y66_the_spirit_network_desc:0 "Remarkable in both life and death, the Emperor retains his iron will, and has been known to compel lesser spirits to do his bidding. He has amassed a number of courtiers in this manner, and intends for them to be hosted in a series of temples across the realm built for that specific purpose. This, he says, will enable him to make direct contact with them and, as a consequence, attain a more accurate assessment of the realm, its strengths, and its weaknesses."
 Y66_the_fort_title:0 "The Fort"
 Y66_the_fort_desc:0 "When the great elven conqueror Jaher came to Haless, he conquered all before him -- Rahen crumbled and though the warrior-monks of the Xia fought him off once, they succumbed the second time. But the great fort at Taibo -- that held him and all his invasion off for years.\n\nIt is a place of pride for all our people. But during the recent strife, it has fallen behind on maintenance, and grown a shadow of its prior self. As we reclaim our past glory in so many ways, we must restore Taibo as well."
 Y66_the_silk_moths_title:0 "The Silk Moths"
 Y66_the_silk_moths_desc:0 "The traitor-son's war saw fields burned, cities sacked, people slaughtered. So it is no surprise some of the most vulnerable -- yet most valuable -- beings in [Root.GetName] were harmed as well: the silk moths, who require a specific diet and carefully-controlled habitat to produce their precious strands. With the war complete, we must restore silk production immediately."
 Y66_the_army_title:0 "The Army"
 Y66_the_army_desc:0 "To achieve our ever growing ambitions we have to assemble an army capable of fulfilling them. Unfortunately we still haven't the required infrastructure to mobilize and sustain a large army. Let us build barracks to accommodate more soldiers and farm estates to feed them. Our enemies shall think twice before taking any actions against us. May the streets tremble under the foots of our armies."
 Y66_the_artillery_title:0 "The Artillery"
 Y66_the_artillery_desc:0 "The first tribute from Verkal Ozovar, paid in 872 AA, came in the form of a dozen cannons. Though these weapons of war were utterly foreign to the kings of the time, they quickly seized on the opportunity presented, leading to victory in countless battles.\n\nNow that cannons are becoming more and more widespread, we too must seize this opportunity. Study those 9th century texts in light of our present day designs -- with an integrated artillery force, none can or will stand against us."
 Y66_the_post_act_title:0 "The Post Act"
 Y66_the_post_act_desc:0 "One benefit the Ghost-Emperor provided our nation that we now lack is the ability to use spirits as messengers. We built a reliance on the rapid transmittal of messages, which facilitated trade, governance, and tactics. We should create a network of messengers that while less effective than the spirits, will fill that role."
 Y66_the_great_canal_title:0 "The Great Canal"
 Y66_the_great_canal_desc:0 "Mo Hoang rests between the Hukai and Khom Ma rivers, along which much of our trade flows. Our merchants have put forward a proposal to undertake an expensive, but profitable project to build a canal between the two rivers. Doing so would greatly reduce the time it takes to transport goods, and we would be in a much stronger position to control the trade passing through, by inspecting vessels using it."
 Y66_the_economy_reforms_title:0 "The Economy Reforms"
 Y66_the_economy_reforms_desc:0 "Cannorian merchants have eagerly been buying our silk, but expanding silk production is a relatively difficult and expensive process. Our cotton has also attracted their attention and is much easier to increase production of.\n\nThe northern plains have the proper climate and soil conditions to allow for great fields of cotton to supply the westerner’s demand, provided we invest the resources to kick-start the industry."
 
#Row 5
 Y66_the_great_survey_title:0 "The Great Survey"
 Y66_the_great_survey_desc:0 "The ritual that bound the Ghost-Emperor to reality was the product of his fury and his will, both greater than any man's. But maintaining that tie... there, the mages can help.\n\nThey suggest an artifact that uses the magic-stone Tamphora, as a concentrated power source to feed his being. Unfortunately, that blue stone is incredibly expensive, but we may have a lead. The damaged High Temples in Mo Hoang leak a similar magical signature, indicating they must have Tamphora in their foundations. Certainly somewhere nearby there must be enough to mine!"
 Y66_the_anchor_to_reality_title:0 "The Anchor to Reality"
 Y66_the_anchor_to_reality_desc:0 "It started with a small blue pebble, which caused a moderate-size explosion when a passing soldier kicked it. Then we started to dig, and the dirt's faint blue glow confirmed we were on the right track.\n\nThe Ghost-Emperor is greater than any man, however, and if this artifact is to bind him to our world it must have commensurable stature. Expand the mines, extract every shed of Tamphora, for [Root.GetName]!"
 Y66_the_ghost_epic_title:0 "The Ghost Epic"
 Y66_the_ghost_epic_desc:0 "Many stories have been passed down generation to generation in [Root.GetName]. There is the tale of Lemang Chettha, who stood strong against Jaher; there is his son, Ca, who bound Baihon Xinh together with a might fist after the elf's demise.\n\nNow there is another figure, who matches and surpasses his predecessors in fortitude and will. He deserves an epic of his own, so that all may hear of the justice of his rule and the prosperity of his realm."
 Y66_the_first_dissemination_title:0 "The First Dissemination"
 Y66_the_first_dissemination_desc:0 ""The winds and the pines are whispering,\n  The river girds in its flight,\nMy footfalls sound through ancient tiles\n  sparkling brilliant in the light.\n\nWhat monarch rules these palace walls?\n  Where voices rang and rang\nWho built this realm of glory now?\n  It could only be Caoban Sang."\n\n-One of the many poems dedicated to the Ghost-Emperor, spread far throughout Haless to ensure all know of his deeds."
 Y66_the_pilgrims_title:0 "The Pilgrims"
 Y66_the_pilgrims_desc:0 "The traitor-sons of Caoban Sang betrayed more than their father and their country. They also betrayed their faith -- and the ruin their war brought to the High Temples a reflection of that fact.\n\nIn the awe they inspire, they echo the Ghost-Emperor himself. Just as he repaired the realm, we must repair the temples (and once done, the steady stream of pilgrims should more than pay for the work)."
 Y66_the_jewel_of_the_south_title:0 "The Jewel of the South"
 Y66_the_jewel_of_the_south_desc:0 "Tuan Caoban is the heart of [Root.GetName], but as more and more have flocked to this land of prosperity, brought by the epics we have spread far and wide, the city has sprawled. Markets are crowded to bursting, new arrivals stay in ramshackle huts, and the less said about the smell, the better.\n\nA sword must be sharpened, a jewel must be cut. Even the Ghost-Emperor required rituals to see his will done. We must immediately renovate Tuan Caoban, such that the city in truth matches -- and surpasses -- the city of stories."
 Y66_the_tolerance_act_title:0 "The Tolerance Act"
 Y66_the_tolerance_act_desc:0 ""Whereas, the subjects of [Root.GetName] come from many peoples, of many faiths.\nWhereas, all subjects have something to offer the state, and deserve its aid in that work.\n(...)\nBe it hereby decreed by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], by the authority vested in the throne of [Root.GetName], that all races, faiths, and backgrounds shall be welcomed to [Root.GetName], with incidents of distolerance punished by not less than one year in prison (...)"\n\n-An excerpt of the 1591 Tolerance Act, which cemented [Root.GetName]'s status as a land of opportunity for all in Haless."
 Y66_the_second_dissemination_title:0 "The Second Dissemination"
 Y66_the_second_dissemination_desc:0 "Just as with so many of Caoban Sang's decisions, the work he demanded on immortalizing his story in song and poem has had benefits spiralling out through the years. It binds our people together, invites the best and brightest to join [Root.GetName], and ensures his great legacy continues.\n\nThus, we should not let it remain 'merely' a local work. Far to the west is a land of traders, surely they would appreciate access to Haless's best art?"
 Y66_the_artificers_title:0 "The Artificers"
 Y66_the_artificers_desc:0 "Gnomes, famously, have extremely broad interests -- they are fascinated by every single aspect and application of artificery. This has advantages, but can sometimes be frustrating, if their aims are misaligned with those of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nWe just received an emissary from the Gommo's members in [Root.Capital.GetName] seeking funding for a bevy of new projects. We should use this chance to direct their research into areas that will best aid [Root.GetName]!"

#Events

 flavor_honsai.4.t:0 "The Ghost-Emperor returns to the Spirit realm"
 flavor_honsai.4.d:0 "No matter how blazing the noon, the sun still sets. No matter how strong the tree, it some day falls. And though the Ghost-Emperor was a spirit like no other, an unparalleld monarch, his time with us has now passed. We are left with his legacy: resolve, will, and a path to follow."
 flavor_honsai.4.a:0 "A new Era!"
 flavor_honsai.4.b:0 "A new Era!"
 flavor_honsai.4.c:0 "A new Era!"
 flavor_honsai.4.e:0 "A new Era!"
 flavor_honsai.4.f:0 "A new Era!"
 flavor_honsai.4.g:0 "A new Era!"
 flavor_honsai.4.h:0 "A new Era!"
 flavor_honsai.5.t:0 "Tamphora Deposit Found"
 flavor_honsai.5.d:0 "There was a small guard detachment accompanying the miners we had sent to hunt out Tamphora, who found the work both a relaxing break from combat and (truth be told) somewhat boring. So it is no surprise that they took up small games, kicking stones along the roads as they walked. It was a small breach of discipline, but minor -- and when one of the pebbles exploded in light and sound after being kick, it was proved to be extremely fortuitous.\n\nFrom the pebble, our miners were able to identify a small seam of Tamphora, and are already setting up extraction facilities. We cannot be sure how long it will last, but every shred of the mage-stone will serve the Ghost-Emperor's cause."
 flavor_honsai.5.a:0 "The spirits smile upon us!"
 flavor_honsai.6.t:0 "The Tamphora Runs Dry"
 flavor_honsai.6.d:0 "Three weeks ago we mined the last piece of blue mage-stone from the deposit we had identified. Since then, all we have found is soil (and a few, less-precious, metals). It seems the land is done with its bounty: should we let it rest and return to its rice-field days, or should we repurpose the already-built mining infrastructure for other uses?"
 flavor_honsai.6.a:0 "Rice it was, and rice it shall be again."
 flavor_honsai.6.b:0 "Maybe we find some ore deeper in our mine?"
 flavor_honsai.7.t:0 "The Spirit Network"
 flavor_honsai.7.d:0 "The Ghost-Emperor is a sovereign of men, indisputable heir to the mantle of Baihon Xinh. But he is greater than any who have come before -- for the spirits listen to him as well, and obey.\n\nThis is proven by recent happenings in [Root.GetName]: a faint glow surrounds the palace in [Root.Capital.GetName] at night, while many report hearing orders delivered by spirits walking in their dreams or appearing during a temple visit. The Ghost-Emperor's will spreads, and we are bound more tightly to glory as it does."
 flavor_honsai.7.a:0 "I dreamt of a... silk scarf, to be delivered tomorrow?"
 flavor_honsai.8.t:0 "In Art and Artistry"
 flavor_honsai.8.d:0 "Is it a sculpture? A tool? A religious artifact? The contraption our mages have dreamed up has elements of all three -- there the motifs of a High Temple, here a filigree of precious metal, though they claim it is all for the purpose of harnessing the Tamphora at the relic's core.\n\nEven Caoban Sang might not be able to decipher quite how this works. But we know this: when the Ghost-Emperor touched the device, it began to hum, and a smile slowly spread across our sovereign's face. He had the will to lead [Root.GetName], and now he has the means as well. Though even this binding will not last forever, and we must do more to ensure the Ghost-Emperor's reign, today marks a shift in many worlds: our own, the spirit realm, and the future of Haless."
 flavor_honsai.8.a:0 "Finally!"
 flavor_honsai.9.t:0 "Hon Sai ask us to join them"
 flavor_honsai.9.desc:0 "An emissary from Hon Sai requests a deepening of ties between our countries. Ever since their support saw our tribe grow into great kings, we have benefitted from cooperation -- should we accept the proposal?"
 flavor_honsai.9.a:0 "We accept"
 flavor_honsai.9.b:0 "We accept"
 flavor_honsai.9.c:0 "Send a most polite apology as we decline."
 flavor_honsai.9.d:0 "Send a most polite apology as we decline."
 flavor_honsai.10.t:0 "The Ghost Congress"
 flavor_honsai.10.d:0 "Finally the day has arrived, delegates from all estates gather in the west wing of the palace. The bribes have worked and everybody important attended in person to this event, later called the Ghost Congress. They all came prepared to milk our state even more than we promised them, but they made a critical error in their plans. Most of the people here have never met the Ghost-Emperor and as soon as he entered the venue everything was under his control. His presence demanded absolute devotion to one single cause, the development of [Root.GetName] and to take revenge on all who wronged us. As a just ruler the Ghost-Emperor granted the privileges he promised, but denied all further inquiries of which there were only very few. After a very efficient and productive meeting the congress ended totally in favor of the Ghost-Emperor. The people left invigorated by the spirit of Baihon Xinh, now dedicated to the cause."
 flavor_honsai.10.a:0 "Finally!"
 flavor_honsai.11.t:0 "A Kingdom Reborn"
 flavor_honsai.11.d:0 "There is much yet to do, though we are united once more, the people of Baihon Xinh cannot rest on their laurels. The Ghost-Emperor has built something great from the ashes of his children's treachery, but now has even greater visions of grandeur. He dreams of an empire, strong enough to rival all, unifying the Kai people under its banner. With our allies at our sides and empowered by the magnificent and fervor inspiring aura of the Ghost-Emperor we shall erase every trace of those, who would halt the march of the righteous. Once the fools thought our fall was inevitable, but now the dwarves cower in their mountainous hold, fearing the drums of our encroaching armies, and the pirates frantically build more ships, preparing for our incoming revenge."
 flavor_honsai.11.a:0 "The Ghost-Emperor wills it!" 
 flavor_honsai.12.t:0 "The Ultimatum"
 flavor_honsai.12.d:0 "For weeks now, we have watched as the soldiers of [FROM.Country.GetName] built up along our border. As such, when the [FROM.Country.GetAdjective] diplomat arrived in our capital, we were not surprised. What was mildly surprising was that it was not a declaration of war they brought, but instead a missive with an ultimatum.\n\n'Honorable [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], I hope this letter finds you well. Once, our kingdoms worked together, but in time, we went our different ways. Now, our ambitions are at odds, but we do not wish you or your kingdom any harm. So much blood has already been shed these past few decades, so to avoid further bloodshed, I am asking that you stand with us yet again.\n\n[Y66.Monarch.GetTitle] [Y66.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_honsai.12.a:0 "I see we have little choice in the matter..."

The clergy is in favor of the House, since they represent stability and continuity.\n\nThe House of Taikhon:\n\nNo child in Baihon Xinh hasn't heard of the riches of House Taikhon. The stories tell of hidden vaults filled with riches beyond any imagination. As the ruling family of Cay Cam Sinh they got rich by investing in trade and founding their own trade company, rather than stealing from others and extorting the local populace. The House is favored by the merchants, hoping they would further reduce mercantilism and push economic reforms.\n\nThe House of Visal:\n\nWhile they are the youngest House on the list, they are nevertheless one of the biggest Houses. Founded by Visal, the famous battlemage general of the traitor-son war, his descendants are known for their prowess and tactical ingenuity. Visal was admired by men for his might and loved by the women for his stamina. Being led by a Visal is the hope of many aspiring soldiers and our enemies fear the arcane destruction they bring.

It was an exhilarating sight, from small fishing ships to great warships, the port was full of activity. Aside from some other Cannorian ships, loading their cargo with cotton and silk, I saw bulky tradeships hoisting the flag of different Yansheni nations, elven ships from the far east and curiously even some ships hoisting the pirate flag. Local sailors told me that they were serving under a subsidiary of Baihon Xinh, protecting their interest and harming the competition. Unfortunately my stay here is only short and I have to take a small river boat to Tuan Caoban to accompany a diplomat to meet with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Baihon Xinh.\n\n20.6: The trip to Tuan Caoban was short and we arrived early in the morning. What a sight to behold, the stories told in my hometown don't even come close to describing the splendor of Tuan Caoban. The river port was located a bit outside of the city. As soon as we arrived a diplomat from Baihon Xinh welcomed us and took us to a messaging station to give notice that we arrived. We then took a wagon bringing us to the front gate of Tuan Caoban. We drove though lush fields, ever watched by the mighty Fort Taibo looming on the hill side next to the capital. After entering the city made of stone the diplomat left us together with the head of our delegation to meet with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for negotiations and I got the rest of the day off. I took this free time to explore the city. My first destination was the University of Tuan Caoban, famous for its diverse curriculum and freedom of opinion. While on the way there I saw a military column, dragging along multi-barreled artillery, walking in perfect tact. I spotted at least 3 different temples, some for religion I haven't heard the name until now. The city was bustling with humans, elves, dwarves, harimari, gnomes and other races. The gnomes I heard took up residence here to freely pursue their interest in artificery. They installed light in the main street to keep them illuminated even during the nights. After taking a tour around the university, visiting the economy department, where I listened to a class regarding trade flow, and the artificery department, seeing machines I'm not able to comprehend, I took a stroll through the grand bazaar. Mercenaries from Lot Dekkhang were recruiting new recruits and people from Jaya Raya, dressed as if they directly came from the jungle, sold exotic spices. After buying more than I was able to carry alone I went back to the inn to get a good night's sleep before I am finally able to see the grand palace of the Ghost-Emperor tomorrow and meet with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the ruler over Baihon Xinh and thus over all Haless."

Large swaths of land have been designated to only be allowed the growing of cotton, with the state providing farmers with the cotton seeds and instructions on how to grow them properly.
