 ##events
 diggy_encounter.1.t:0 "A Good Night's Sleep\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.1.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The campfire crackles, faint sparks rising through the smoke, warm food, and comfortable blankets. That is what adventurers need to carry on their task, and, luckily, that is what our expedition got last night. Stories were exchanged, songs were sung, and trophies were admired."
 diggy_encounter.1.a:0 "Good morning!"

 diggy_encounter.2.t:0 "Deserters In the Expedition\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.2.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The expedition leader looked on in confusion as a group of explorers threw their weapons away. “What is this?” he asked before being bombarded by complaints.\n\nReckless dungeoneering, rampant crime, lacking medical support, and more. Those were the complaints brought before the leader as the soldiers went on their own way, leaving him stupefied."
 diggy_encounter.2.a:0 "That's it, I quit!"

 diggy_encounter.3.t:0 "Serpentbloom?\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.3.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]A small stream of water trickles down into the next cavern. Its walls are filled with a yellow, vaguely luminescent fungus, its shape reminiscent of Serpentbloom. As an adventurer comes closer, a cleric intervenes: “Halt,” he says, “we don't know if this is dangerous, let me investigate.” After a short time, the cleric returns to the troop. “It is edible,” he declares. Soon the evening meals contain this fungus as a staple, and the troop has stocked up on supplies."
 diggy_encounter.3.a:0 ""You should come try this!""

 diggy_encounter.10.t:0 "Lost Malfunctioning Golem\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.10.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Around every corner of the Serpentspine there might be another secret, another adventure, or another relic of its long history. Those relics may be long broken, but sometimes they are just resting.\n\nAs metal scrapes on stone and faint whining of gears reverberates from the walls, a towering figure appears in front of a forward expedition. An iron golem stands tall, its body ready to fight intruders once again. At least, what it thinks are intruders."
 diggy_encounter.10.a:0 "ATTACK -ZRSH- IMMINENT"
 diggy_encounter.10.b:0 "Through its legs, through its legs!"

 diggy_encounter.11.t:0 "Crushed Metal, Broken Gears\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.11.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The golem's torso crashes to the ground, sending shocks through the surrounding caves. Springs and gears get ejected as its protective shielding fails. A last wisp of steam escapes the broken surface, and the golem is defeated."
 diggy_encounter.11.a:0 "As the old falters, the new will take its place. Onwards!"

 diggy_encounter.12.t:0 "A Crushing Defeat\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.12.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The expedition engaged the golem in a narrow pathway, but the sundering power with which the golem smashes steel and bones alike soon overwhelmed even the sturdiest of adventurers. Shields splinter, weapons shatter, and the expedition flees from the creature's merciless metallic fists. Even now the sound of stone shattering echoes through the halls, a haunting reminder of those who lost their lives."
 diggy_encounter.12.a:0 "Things were just built better, back then..."

 diggy_encounter.20.t:0 "Webs on the Walls\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.20.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The first thing the scouts noticed were the nets: sticky patches of glistening white strings started lining the halls left and right. The strings vibrate when they touch anything, sending waves deep into the dark.\n\nThere was no denying: A nest of spiders must be near, and big ones, from the look of it. And deep in its heart, there might be treasures they have taken there, cocooned into their slippery silk. A small force could retrieve such trinkets and scout ahead, looking for a way through. On the other hand, there is a small crevice that might lead around the whole affair."
 diggy_encounter.20.a:0 "Send out some scouts!"
 diggy_encounter.20.b:0 "Let us not risk unnecessary dangers."

 diggy_encounter.21.t:0 "Trinkets and Baubles\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.21.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As expected, the spiders tucked some gold and gems away from the prying eyes of fortune seekers, but courage prevailed in the face of danger and our scouts returned with troves of treasure. Curiously they saw no trace of the silk-weavers, just empty halls lined with webs."
 diggy_encounter.21.a:0 "It was probably abandoned; it doesn't matter anymore."

 diggy_encounter.22.t:0 "Curious is the Trapmakers' Art...\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.22.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As our scouts return, their number diminished, they report of the horror they saw. There was no need to fear the spiders, their traps were enough already.\n\nAs a particularly unlucky member stepped on what seemed to be stable ground, the nets hidden by rocks gave way into a crevice, leading to gods-know-where. Others got crushed in avalanches triggered by the unassuming vibrations of small webs, and even more just… stuck to the webs, with no way to cut them down without getting stuck as well."
 diggy_encounter.22.a:0 "...His efficacy unwitnessed by his own eyes."

 diggy_encounter.23.t:0 "Eyes In The Dark\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.23.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Darn it, the nest was not abandoned. And what we assumed was a safe way around was the true trap!\n\nAs the convoy made its way through the corridor, spiders ambushed them, injected their paralyzing poison, cocooned them, and carried them away, somewhere deep into their nest. Despite this horrific display of cruelty, cold steel cannot be poisoned, and our weapons decimated their number faster than they could abduct us. In the end, we managed to free most of our men, but the eight-legged beasts destroyed some of our supplies."
 diggy_encounter.23.a:0 "We shall never go there again."

 diggy_encounter.30.t:0 "Deep Rothé\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.30.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The Rothé is a curious creature, living both in the light above, and the dark below. They are excellent animals, they are strong, their meat is tender, and their disposition is agreeable. It is therefore no wonder that the Serpentspine once housed many of these beasts.\n\nNowadays most are imported from the surface, but some of them managed to survive the tunnels and caves on their own. A herd of these are just ahead, their fur long and tangled, their horns spiralling along their heads. They would make an excellent addition to our diet, but who knows what strength they possess if they survived here?"
 diggy_encounter.30.a:0 "Kill them for their meat!"
 diggy_encounter.30.b:0 "Better leave them alone, those horns look menacing…"

 diggy_encounter.31.t:0 "Victory of the Cleaver\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.31.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The Rothé posed no problem for our weapons. The docile beasts didn't know what was upon them until it was too late. They were slow and sluggish, fattened by the serpentbloom that grows in these caves. Soon the entire herd lay victim to our cook's cleaver, so that the expedition may now enjoy a fresh meal again."
 diggy_encounter.31.a:0 "Finally, a break from the hardtack."

 diggy_encounter.32.t:0 "Rage of the Beasts\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.32.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]It takes considerable strength to survive this deep in the Serpentspine, and we should have known that from our own experiences. Although the Rothé eventually went to the chopping block, they did not leave our numbers unscarred. The raw power of their crushing hooves and piercing horns has felled more than their fair share."
 diggy_encounter.32.a:0 "Let us prepare a feast for the fallen."

 diggy_encounter.40.t:0 "Pitch Black Darkness\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.40.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The caverns deep in the Serpentspine are usually lined with luminescent plants, fungi, and other sources of ambient light, but there are some parts where no light pierces the darkness, places of eternal gloom, where some of the most dangerous monsters house. As the expedition enters one of these dark stretches, a grue, a terrifying monstrosity of the dark, attacks."
 diggy_encounter.40.a:0 "Hold the line!"

 diggy_encounter.41.t:0 "Banish the Darkness!\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.41.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]With sword and spears the grue was driven into the light, where it lost most of its shadowy advantage, sending the monster into a blind rage, thrashing and wailing at the expedition. This opened the way for a coordinated attack, killing the beast."
 diggy_encounter.41.a:0 "Keep those torches lit!"

 diggy_encounter.42.t:0 "Unseen Horror\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.42.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]One by one, one by one, the monstrosity picked out the soldiers. Muffled screams from the darkness alluded to the horrific being stalking us. One by one our numbers diminished until far too many were lost.\n\n“If we run back now, all will be for nought,” the expedition leader exclaimed, but not a second later he was taken in by the grue, sending the rest of the expedition fleeing. Only a few return from the darkness into the safe light... the darkness of the Serpentspine has claimed so many lives in the past, and now it has taken its due once more."
 diggy_encounter.42.a:0 "Let us huddle in the torchlight, and be ever-grateful for it."

 diggy_encounter.50.t:0 "Flock of Cloakers\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.50.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]While exploring the caverns and crevices of the Serpentspine it is not uncommon for the groups to disperse from time to time, leaving stragglers behind. At the end of the day, they usually join with the main group again and that's that.\n\nUsually.\n\nWhile counting our numbers at the day's end, the quartermaster quickly picked d upon a few missing expeditionaries.\n\n“Get out there and find them,” the captain commands, but before we could depart they soon arrived at camp -- in a dead sprint, running away from soft sailing shadows above them.\n\n“CLOAKERS!” one shouts, before being picked up by one of these nightmarish creatures."
 diggy_encounter.50.a:0 "“Archers! Take Aim!”"

 diggy_encounter.51.t:0 "The Aberrations Disperse in the Darkness\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.51.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As soon as our archers and gunners took aim and started bombarding the cloakers with arrows and lead the monsters quickly dispersed. “They are known for picking up stragglers and people left behind on battlefields,” a seasoned adventurer recalls, “not for direct attacks. We must have scared them away.”"
 diggy_encounter.51.a:0 "A trifling victory, but a victory nonetheless"

 diggy_encounter.52.t:0 "A Loss of Supplies\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.52.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As soon as our archers and gunners took aim and started bombarding the cloakers with arrows and lead the monsters quickly dispersed. “They are known for picking up stragglers and people left behind on battlefields,” a seasoned adventurer recalls, “not for direct attacks. We must have scared them away.” He pauses and looks around. “At the cost of some of our supplies, it seems,” he adds."
 diggy_encounter.52.a:0 "Damn those creatures!"

 diggy_encounter.53.t:0 "The Belly of the Beast\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.53.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As soon as our archers and gunners took aim and started bombarding the cloakers with arrows and lead the monsters quickly dispersed. “They are known for picking up stragglers and people left behind on battlefields,” a seasoned adventurer recalls, “not for direct attacks. We must have scared them away.” There is silence for a moment.\n\n“Well, onwards then!” another exclaims. “Chase them, let us find where they stash all of their loot!”\n\nSoon the expedition descends on the cloakers with vigour, slaying every last one of them. In the centre of their hide-out waited the cloakers' stash, a glistening pile of loot for the taking."
 diggy_encounter.53.a:0 "A worthwhile endeavour."

 diggy_encounter.54.t:0 "The Terror in the Lightless Dark\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.54.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Darkness overtook us, the winged beasts blotted out every source of light. Haunting moans mingled with terrified screams as the cloakers descended upon us. They flew silent like owls, the knowledge that they are there more terrifying than their actual presence.\n\nNo one dared light a torch until much later. How long had it been since the cloakers had left us behind? It is hard to say. A look around tells the story of the attack: Many bodies, bitten to death, and huge losses in our supplies."
 diggy_encounter.54.a:0 "We must consolidate what we still have."

 diggy_encounter.60.t:0 "Drums in the Deep\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.60.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Bellowing screams and drum-like pounding echo through the winding hallways, sure signs that there are cave trolls nearby. Despite their sluggish movements and stupid grimaces, they do know how to kill. We have been cornered into a cave with no other exit and the stomping of feet draws ever nearer to us."
 diggy_encounter.60.a:0 "Assemble a barricade, ready the weapons!"

 diggy_encounter.61.t:0 "Victory!\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.61.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As a sword plunges through the last living troll the expedition rejoices. Around them lie the misshaped bodies of dozens of cave trolls, their skin slit open, skulls bashed. The drums have gone quiet and safety has returned to these halls. For now."
 diggy_encounter.61.a:0 "Death to the giantkin!"

 diggy_encounter.62.t:0 "Beaten Against the Walls\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.62.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]A cleric takes a sorrowful step across the battlefield riddled with corpses. The trolls stand out like boulders, surrounded by the remains of many of our adventurers.\n\n“A tragedy,” she exclaims. “Let us honour those who protected us and mourn their sacrifice.”\n\nAll who are left agree in silence, averting their eyes from the carnage surrounding them. At least the drums have stopped."
 diggy_encounter.62.a:0 "Silence surrounds us"

 diggy_encounter.63.t:0 "Troll Hoard Ahead\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.63.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]“Onward! Their treasure must be stowed away around here,” a particularly ambitious explorer shouts and rouses the fortune seekers. They build a rag-tag group of scavengers scouring the surrounding halls for troll hoard. They find it eventually and bring back an impressive haul of gold, gems, ancient art, and mystical weaponry."
 diggy_encounter.63.a:0 "Trinkets and baubles, paid for in blood"

 diggy_encounter.70.t:0 "Collapsing Cave!\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.70.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Faint dust trickled down from the cave’s ceiling, building small piles like stalactites. Upon further inspection, the rocky pillars securing the roof appear to have cracks that run deep into the stone. A debate sparks whether this cave should be traversed or not, but it was already too late. The ceiling gave way to the pressure building up, sending an avalanche of rocks and boulders down towards the expedition, killing and entombing many members within moments."
 diggy_encounter.70.a:0 ""I told you so!""

 diggy_encounter.80.t:0 "Great Mushrooms\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.80.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]A great cavern opens up in front of the expedition leader, small streams of water trickling down the natural stairs carved out by long past tectonic activity. After a few steps down the water converges to a lake, surrounded by greater-than-life mushrooms. Their stalks glow violet and the caps extrude a dizzying smell, but not necessarily in a bad way. At their feet are more colonies with smaller mushrooms with up many different colours."
 diggy_encounter.80.a:0 "Take them with us, we need the food."
 diggy_encounter.80.b:0 "Better leave them be, who knows what those are."

 diggy_encounter.81.t:0 "Edible Mushrooms\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.81.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Among the samples the expedition took were many edible, and, quite frankly, delicious specimen. A small group went back to get some more, and the cooks are thankful for the variety they brought to the dreary diet."
 diggy_encounter.81.a:0 "Great!"

 diggy_encounter.82.t:0 "Violet Fever\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.82.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The cook stirred up a meal with great excitement: they had finally gotten a new ingredient to try out for the evening meal after months of relying on dried, stored, provisions. At first the dinner seemed excellent, but soon the mushrooms' poison took hold of the expedition.\n\nA raging sickness, dubbed the Violet Fever due to the ugly discoloration of the skin and bulging pustules, swept through the expedition. Few of the infected survived, and those that do still suffer from the damage the poison wrought."
 diggy_encounter.82.a:0 "Feed the remainder to the cook responsible!"

 diggy_encounter.83.t:0 "Toxic Spores\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.83.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Despite our tries to leave the mushrooms alone, their caps shook as we passed through the cavern, releasing toxic spores that stuck to the adventurers, causing rashes and ugly necrosis. Even days later the infected were battling with the strange sickness before finally succumbing to it."
 diggy_encounter.83.a:0 "We should barricade the cave."

 diggy_encounter.90.t:0 "Hobgoblin Raiders\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.90.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]A forward scout hastily returns to the expedition leader: He tells of a group of heavily armoured, red-skinned humanoids traversing the caves ahead. The leader recognizes the threat immediately: Hobgoblins. There is only one way to make these interlopers understand that they are unwanted, and that is a show of force."
 diggy_encounter.90.a:0 "To arms!"
 diggy_encounter.90.b:0 "Wait, why not see if we can cooperate?"

 diggy_encounter.91.t:0 "A Costly Victory\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.91.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Clashing steel, thundering guns, whirring bows, those are the signs of battle, and what a battle it was! After hours of skirmishes, clashing lines and warfare we finally emerged victorious, the hobgoblins slain, red blood on red skin soaking the ground, but next to them lie many of our adventurers as well."
 diggy_encounter.91.a:0 "But a victory nonetheless."

 diggy_encounter.92.t:0 "A Costly Defeat\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.92.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Hobgoblin discipline is truly something to behold. Despite hours of skirmishes, clashing steel and all-out battle their line never broke, a daunting wall of well-armoured intruders. Then, suddenly, they made their advance, plunging into our faltering lines and smashing them. In our retreat we lost many men and even more supplies."
 diggy_encounter.92.a:0 "We must consolidate what we still have, then press on."

 diggy_encounter.93.t:0 "A Crushing Victory\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.93.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Hobgoblins are trained to fight on the open fields of Rahen, or maybe even the dwarovrod, but their tactics are useless in the labyrinthine crevices of the Serpentspine. Through repeated skirmishes we decimated their number easily with minimal losses, claiming their supplies and loot for our expedition."
 diggy_encounter.93.a:0 "Take that, you stealing intruders!"

 diggy_encounter.94.t:0 "A Crushing Defeat\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.94.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]It was a useless idea trying to engage the hobgoblins from the front. Their disciplined lines held out while their archers and gunners mowed through our troops like a war wizard, utterly defeating us.\n\nOur losses are innumerable, our weapons and spirit broken. Just counting the few survivors as they try their best to tend to their wounds is a grim task, beyond the captain's will. Too many lives have been sacrificed for nothing."
 diggy_encounter.94.a:0 "What now…"

 diggy_encounter.100.t:0 "They Are Above Us!\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.100.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The expedition enters a wide cavern full of stalactites, walls shimmering with strange minerals. Distracted by the unique beauty they notice too late that there are no stalagmites under their hanging counterpart. Then a veritable legion of piercers, larval ropers, descend from the ceiling like vultures, impaling the unsuspecting expedition."
 diggy_encounter.100.a:0 "Kill them! Kill them all!"

 diggy_encounter.101.t:0 "Pierced The Enemy\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.101.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Our spears make quick process of the lurking larvae, impaling them before they can do much more damage to our troops. Soldiers stab around them with enough awareness to not hit their fellow explorers, trying to hit as many slithering creatures as possible. The frenzy comes to a close when the last piercers slither away and flee."
 diggy_encounter.101.a:0 "Good job!"

 diggy_encounter.102.t:0 "Pierced and Piercing\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.102.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]A general frenzy breaks out as the piercers descend and impale our troops. It seems like an even match; the expedition only gains the upper hand at a late stage of the battle.\n\nAs the last larvae slither away the expedition leader surveys the losses. He shakes his head. “This was an avoidable incident,” he thinks to himself."
 diggy_encounter.102.a:0 "Open your eyes next time!"

 diggy_encounter.110.t:0 "Wandering Husks\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.110.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Many terrors stalk the caverns of the serpent spine, but none are so apathetic to their own dangerousness as wandering husks laden with poison. Each step, they exude wafts of poisonous gas, dispersing it into the thick air around. A group of these monsters has just crossed paths with our expedition. We cannot easily get rid of them -- a concerted charge would just rile these foes up even more, their poison taking countless casualties."
 diggy_encounter.110.a:0 "Try to avoid them at all costs!"
 diggy_encounter.110.b:0 "Approach and handle with care and extract what poison you can."

 diggy_encounter.111.t:0 "Deadly Explosion\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.111.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Not only is the husks' gas poisonous, is also easily flammable -- as we found out the hard way. A single, carelessly dropped torch rolling towards one of the husks was enough to cause a great explosion, triggering even more husks to explode. The shockwave and subsequent inferno luckily caused more injuries than casualties, but not all were so lucky."
 diggy_encounter.111.a:0 "I said, "Avoid them!""

 diggy_encounter.112.t:0 "Poisonous Explosion\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.112.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Husks like these are naturally volatile, prone to self-combustion, releasing their toxic innards into their surroundings in a great explosion. This triggered a chain reaction, filling the cave with noxious gasses. The expedition made haste to escape the gas, but some were infected nonetheless. The danger is now past, but a few have succumbed to the husks' sickness, and a chunk of our supplies are so toxin-logged that they are utterly unsalvageable."
 diggy_encounter.112.a:0 "A cleric! A kingdom for a cleric!"

 diggy_encounter.120.t:0 "The Tunnelling Menace\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.120.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The last few days had been easy travel through long circular hallways connecting the caverns with each other, making climbing equipment redundant for some time, a welcome change to the hostile geography of this particular stretch of the Serpentspine. But it wouldn’t be long that the source of these tunnels was discovered. It announced itself through rumbling thunder, the sound of crushed rock and constant rasping. From the solid rock burst forth a beast like few others, a mighty purple worm, a gigantic cave dweller and ravenous hunter. Its sharp teeth flashed and dark maw gaped as it charged the expedition with hungry intent."
 diggy_encounter.120.a:0 "Mount the defences! Everyone to arms!"

 diggy_encounter.121.t:0 "A Well-Fought Victory\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.121.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Killing a purple worm is no easy feat. Many explorers are torn apart by its teeth, crushed under its gigantic body, or simply flailed away by its erratic movement, but not us. We held out against the monstrosity, bombarding it with all we had, spells, arrows, lead, spears, swords, everything we could weaponize in any way.\n\nNow, after an arduous battle, the worm twitches as it dies, its body riddled with our weapons. As the dust settles the first soldiers come to the body and try to make something of the accomplishment."
 diggy_encounter.121.a:0 "This is worth a great celebration!"
 diggy_encounter.121.b:0 "Cut it up, give it to the butchers, meat is back on the menu!"

 diggy_encounter.122.t:0 "An Insurmountable Foe\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.122.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Purple worms are a menace like few others in the Serpentspine. Its erratic movements send soldiers flying against the cavern walls, its teeth tear apart our troops and even more are crushed by the weight of the gigantic monstrosity. In the end, we can simply count our losses as the worm made its way back into the stone, tunnelling away to raze some other part of the caverns."
 diggy_encounter.122.a:0 "At least it won’t return for now…"

 diggy_encounter.130.t:0 "Drunkards in the Expedition\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.130.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]A scandal has embroiled our expedition! Multiple explorers have lost all decorum and gotten stone-cold drunk, parading through the expedition camp, singing songs so out of tune that they ought to have their mouths clamped shut. But that would just address the symptoms, not the underlying problem.\n\nWe must do something about this behaviour, or we will have an army of drunkards instead of a well-organized group of explorers."
 diggy_encounter.130.a:0 "Make an example of those drunk soldiers and execute them"
 diggy_encounter.130.b:0 "No more alcohol for everyone"
 diggy_encounter.130.c:0 "Leave some for me!"

 diggy_encounter.140.t:0 "Dwarven Explorers\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.140.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The Serpentspine is the ancestral home of all dwarves, so it stands to reason that there would be dwarves roaming even the caverns, searching for traces of their venerated ancestors. Such a party of adventurers is now before us, just around the corner. Can we abide competitors in our search?"
 diggy_encounter.140.a:0 "The orcs knew what to do! Hand me my axe!"
 diggy_encounter.140.b:0 "What great company! Let us search as one!"

 diggy_encounter.141.t:0 "A Display of Power\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.141.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The dwarves never suspected anything. The expedition startled them and cut them down with ease. The Serpentspine has known an ocean of dwarven blood, what are a few more buckets? Clearly, their time is past, it’s on us to establish dominance here."
 diggy_encounter.141.a:0 "Our power dwarfed theirs!"

Like unwavering stone, they held against our attack and then unleashed an avalanche of rocks upon us. They quickly took from us what they could carry and went their merry way, singing songs in their guttural language."

 diggy_encounter.150.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]A creaky, rattling voice echoes through the cave as ghastly spirits appear in front of the expedition. Restless dwarven spirits, damned to spend their existence in unlife. The question remains: What are we to do?"

 diggy_encounter.170.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As the expedition continued down through the rocky cavern they grew more and more frustrated. Treasures had been scarce for some time now, and many adventurers started to argue whether they should head back and take another path. But even after day by day passed this way, a seasoned sage of the Serpentspine now remarks on strange traces on the surrounding rock.\n\n“I suspect,” she says, “that we might come upon a group of flail snails soon. That would explain the recent lack of loot, as these sluggish creatures consume all valuables that cross their paths. Excellent trackers if we fancy following them. Their shells are worth quite a bit of crowns as well, if we wish to strike them down.”"

I’m serious!” Looking at the goblin in confusion one of the guards unsheathes his sword. “SO BE IT!” the goblin shouts and pulls forth a hulking figure of rock, earth and stone from the depths of the elemental planes before disappearing in a puff of smoke. The elemental reels back, then accelerates its arm towards the scouts, slamming it down into the cold stone that a deep rumbling sound permeates the cavern. The scouts run back to the main expedition, but the elemental is just behind them.\n\nShouting and screaming the scouts arrive at the camp and warn the others of the looming threat when the elemental already circles around the last corner, smashing dripstones and hurling boulders in its way.

With a shout the leading general directs all attention to the weak point and orders a volley of bullets. Sharp splinters are dislodged as the hail of metal impacts the core, and slowly the earthen body starts to fall apart, heavy rocks impacting the now muddy ground.

Soon more and more elementals shift out of the stone around us, smaller, but with the same cold ferocity in their attacks. As our ranks start to dwindle, many take their fate into their own hands and flee the battlefield, ducking under the flurry of mud and rocks that is launched from the earthen bodies. Soon the elementals are done with their foul work, returning to inanimate stone, but our ranks have been diminished."

 diggy_encounter.203.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]In the frenzy of battle the general managed to divert some troops to start a distraction further down the hallway, banging their shields and swords. This distraction worked, as suddenly the sorcerer appeared on an alcove above us, watching what made the sudden sound. Our archers took the shot and managed to pierce his robes and green skin, sending him flying over the precipice. As his body shattered upon the rocky floor the elemental vanished, its boulders thundering to the floor, sending shockwaves through the cave.\n\nAfter inspecting the damages and losses some explorers went over to the sorcerer’s corpse to check for anything that might be valuable. Between mangled wands, ugly rations and weird powdered fumes in vials, they also found some books, which, upon further inspection, seemed to be some long forgotten scholarly work on conjuration. The mages rejoiced and immediately went to transcribe the texts into contemporary works."

The scouts return with their observations, so that the expedition leader can decide how to approach this outsider: Seize its meal, or make use of their nature to shift through stone as easily as fish swim through water?"

 diggy_encounter.240.t:0 "Treasure of Ithnir\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.240.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Our chronicler has told us of a powerful dwarven sorcerer by the name of Ithnir, whose legend claims that he has hidden some of his treasure within these parts of the Serpentspine. Often he tried to convince the expedition to search for the fabled riches, but often there were more pressing matters to attend to. Recently, however, following a time of few expeditionary successes, our explorers are more and more inclined to finally search for it. Scouts have been sent out into the dark to search for signs of the wondrous, mages are tuning their wands to recognize magical signatures, and our chronicler is pouring over his scrolls and parchments, looking for clues to the exact location.\n\nAfter five days the first scouts return, with no news of any signs of treasure, but over the course of the day some mages pick up a trace of arcane energies leading down a vast crevice. Scouts are sent out to try and find a safe way down and up again, but there seems to be no path. One group, who has reached the bottom of the crevice, obscured by darkness, by repelling down some rope, report that they have found an old crest of dwarven make. The iconography matches the time of Ithnir, and the emblem is linked to his infamous Wandsmith clan.\n\nDiscussion about how to approach the matter now have ignited all over the place. Our engineers have proposed that we build a hoist to get soldiers and abjurers down to search for the treasure, while some soldiers would prefer to find a way down, arguing that there could be a slope down that has been eroded out of the stone over time. At last, the safer option has been chosen, and the soldiers search for ways down. Fortunately, this path exists, and the entire expedition can descend into the canyon.\n\nIt did not take the mages long to find a magically concealed wall, behind which the hoard of Ithnir gleams at us. Our soldiers ready their bags and chests when the chronicler speaks: “There is, of course, the possibility that Ithnir might have cursed the hoard in order to punish anyone trying to take it by force.” The soldiers fall silent and look at the expedition leader for a decision. What shall we do?"

Even the most superstitious men soon agreed that there was no danger to the treasure, lifting their spirits, arguing what to do with the gold. This discussion is shut down quickly by the expedition leader, who reminds them that all loot goes to the coffers to be given to the contractor. The chronicler has become a hero overnight, finally turning our luck around again, ending the dry track without treasure."
 diggy_encounter.241.a:0 "Gold is gold, and in the end that's what counts"

 diggy_encounter.242.t:0 "The Curse Takes Hold\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.242.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]When we took the gold nothing special happened at first, abating the worries of the superstitious. But as time passes the mood turns around again. Following accidents, complicated caverns and tunnels, hostile encounters, and dwindling water, many of the soldiers are convinced that the gold was cursed after all. This dampened the attitude after the first euphoria of finding the treasure in the first place. Most unfortunate of all, weeks went by without any new discoveries, prolonging the dry track even more."
 diggy_encounter.242.a:0 "It, too, shall pass"

 diggy_encounter.243.t:0 "Turn Around\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.243.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Even after all of the effort that has been undertaken, the expedition leader is not willing to mindlessly risk the lives of their soldiers. The soldiers nod in agreement and start marching towards the ramp again, giving the chroniclers annoyed glares that he would only inform them of the curse this late."
 diggy_encounter.243.a:0 "There is always more treasure to be had elsewhere"

 diggy_encounter.250.t:0 "The Bat Cave\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.250.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]”Look out,” cried one of the scouts, “above us!” He pointed up at the ceiling, where a huge group of large bats hung from the rocky surface, their eyes blinking in the unsteady light of the torches. Roused like that they descended upon the group, biting and tearing on the flesh of the soldiers. Wild flailing without any form of coordination ensued, and panic spread among the expedition."
 diggy_encounter.250.a:0 "Look out, they’re everywhere!"

 diggy_encounter.251.t:0 "Discipline and Decorum\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.251.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Despite the desperate and panic cries of the soldiers, many others managed to keep at least somewhat calm and focused, enough that they managed to organise a coordinated defence, slowly driving the bats away into the caverns and crevices from whence they came. Slowly, but surely, even the most annoying and resisting bats were beaten and removed from the soldiers they had latched onto."

 diggy_encounter.252.t:0 "Everyone For Themselves!\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.252.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]With the panic taking over more and more soldiers, any attempt at coordination and organising a response has failed. The carnivorous bats hunt the soldiers through the cave, tearing them apart with little to no opposition, decimating their numbers. Bloodstained and pale are the corpses left behind."
 diggy_encounter.252.a:0 "Everyone! Out of here!"

 diggy_encounter.260.t:0 "Orc Skeletons\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.260.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As our scout climbs through a crevice a narrow path opens before them. The hallway is riddled with orc skeletons, a gruelling display of savagery as far as the eye can pierce the darkness. Their bones bear the marks of weapons, skulls cracked, and limbs broken in twain."
 diggy_encounter.260.a:0 "Let's see if they have some loot"
 diggy_encounter.260.b:0 "This is the work of Gerin! Look for three broken swords near a wall, it's where the loot is!"

 diggy_encounter.261.t:0 "Coins Beneath the Bones\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.261.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As was to be expected, barely anything was left at the site, most likely cleared out long before our arrival. Some coins still hid under the bones, but nothing valuable was recovered that day."
 diggy_encounter.261.a:0 "It's something at least"

 diggy_encounter.262.t:0 "Barren Bones\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.262.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The entire mausoleum has been cleared, not a single coin, gem or piece of jewellery left on the bones. There is nothing for us here."

 diggy_encounter.263.t:0 "Hidden in the Wall\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.263.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]"Here! Here! The sign of Gerin Orcrend!" a scout yells out to the expedition.\n\nHe has indeed found the sign we've been looking for, three broken swords balanced against the wall. Shovels were quickly brought of the site, unearthing valuables and weapons of orcish artifice, baubles and other treasures, an impressive haul beyond anything we had thought of finding here."

 diggy_encounter.270.t:0 "Rolling Death\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.270.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]While the expedition continues scouting out the caverns, somewhere deep within the dark a thunderous rumbling can be heard, its reverberations echoing through the ground. Splitting and cracking stone herald its arrival: A huge boulder has dislodged deep within the cavern and is headed right for our expedition, an avalanche of smaller stones just behind it."
 diggy_encounter.270.a:0 "RUN! RUN AWAY!"
 diggy_encounter.270.b:0 "Hide away, quickly now!"

 diggy_encounter.271.t:0 "Barely Escaped\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.271.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As the last echoes of the rolling death subsided the explorers and scouts look around. The expedition has scattered. With the sound of a horn, they slowly gather around again, some carrying bodies of our fellow adventurers with them their bodies disfigured by the avalanche."

 diggy_encounter.272.t:0 "Painful Death\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.272.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The rumbling stone luckily overpowers the cracking bones of our expedition. The rolling death arrived so fast that only few managed to escape its thundering path. As the expedition leader looks around, they count many dead, and even more injured. A disaster."

 diggy_encounter.273.t:0 "Caves and Crevices\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.273.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The caverns of the Serpentspine give ample space for crevices and other small pathways where the tumbling rocks cannot reach. It was no problem for our expedition to drop into these and dodge the rolling death. The explorers quickly dispersed into the many holes and overhangs and emerge afterwards, unscathed by the avalanche."
 diggy_encounter.273.a:0 "It's about size, not how you use it"

 diggy_encounter.280.t:0 "Shimmermere\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.280.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Glittering in the faint bioluminescence of the cavern walls lies a pool of clear, calm water, its surface like a mirror. Soon the first soldiers arrive at the shore, their water skins ready to be refilled."

 diggy_encounter.282.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The water is cold and fresh, and the soldiers drink quickly. When the first one starts coughing nobody expected anything. When the second one joins in, silent looks were exchanged, but by then the third and fourth were coughing up blood, and they all started to perish, their bodies soon as cold and lifeless as the water that killed them."
 diggy_encounter.282.a:0 "Curses upon curses!"

 diggy_encounter.290.t:0 "A Colony of Mushroom...People?\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.290.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Mushrooms and fungi are a common sight in the Serpentspine, and they make up a significant part of any dark-dwellers diet, so much so that there are entire manuals and archives full of the properties of the different mushrooms one can find in the depths. It is to no one's surprise, then, that mushrooms are also an integral part of any expedition team exploring the secrets of the old caverns, given the sheer number of mushrooms that can be found there.\n\nAs a few explorers were picking some of these mushrooms from an easily accessible place, the most peculiar thing happened: From the dark emerged a group of strange, roughly humanoid shapes, with wide-brimmed hats. As they came closer it became apparent that these were some kind of living mushrooms, mushrooms of similar species that we were just picking…"
 diggy_encounter.290.a:0 "More food!"

 diggy_encounter.291.t:0 "Food, But At What Cost?\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.291.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]With little thought to the possible repercussions our soldiers slew the mushroom-men, though the screams and terrified squeaks they made were almost intolerable. After the soldiers returned with the food, they regretted what they did more and more. Even now the screams haunt their sleep…"
 diggy_encounter.291.a:0 "I can't believe we did that"

 diggy_encounter.292.t:0 "Angry Mushrooms\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.292.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]"Mushrooms," one of the manuals declares, "can have devastating effects on one's health."\n\nThat is true, however no one prepared the soldiers for the onslaught of what was to come: As more and more shrooms came from the dark they started to pummel the soldiers. Their fists are manageable, but the sheer number of enemies is an overwhelming force to be reckoned with. Those who emerge make a mental note of their strange discovery: Mushrooms, while poisonous, can also be quite feisty."
 diggy_encounter.292.a:0 "No! Not there!"

 diggy_encounter.293.t:0 "A Good Trip With the Mushrooms\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.293.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Despite the damp and spongy look of the mushroom caps they felt more like velvet, at least according to the group of soldiers returning from their gathering tour. Many of them just couldn't help themselves except to give these strange creatures some pats, which they, in turn, seemed to appreciate. Nevertheless, the soldiers seem to be much more upbeat now that they have interacted with these things."
 diggy_encounter.293.a:0 "What a strange encounter…"

 diggy_encounter.294.t:0 "A Bad Experience With the Mushrooms\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.294.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As our men approach the mushroom-people the creatures huddle away in fear, hiding and running from the soldiers. Despite their best tries to convince the mushrooms otherwise, they quickly abandoned the cavern, and we have seen no glimpse of them since."
 diggy_encounter.294.a:0 "We just wanted to be friends"

 diggy_encounter.300.t:0 "Remnant Camp\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.300.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]During the Last Days of the Dwarovar, the century-long decline of the great dwarven empire, many dwarves holed themselves away in their holds, shutting out everyone and everything. These dwarves, the remnants, have slowly started to creep out of their halls once again and established small outposts throughout their ancestral land. One of these groups has now been presented to us, around 500 dwarves tending to a small village tucked away in the depths of a cavern. After surveying them for a few hours we must decide what to do with them. The village is blocking our path, so we have to somehow remove them from here."
 diggy_encounter.300.a:0 "Offer them a new home"

 diggy_encounter.301.t:0 "Old Claims\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.301.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The remnants have decided to accept our offer for a new home and are now tagging along with the rest of the expedition. In return they gave us access to their village and the surrounding land to resupply and later incorporate into our own holdings."
 diggy_encounter.301.a:0 "Great"
 diggy_encounter.301.tooltip:0 "We will be able to use the existing infrastructure in this province, however the Remnants demand initial autonomy"

 diggy_encounter.302.t:0 "Refusal\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.302.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The village chief, a young and gnarly dwarf by the name of Gundar Headstrong, turns out to be aptly named. With a simple and effective “No” he has shut down our attempts at reconciliation with his village. He says he has strict orders from his hold to stay here and work the land, and no one and nothing will break his loyalty."
 diggy_encounter.302.a:0 "At least they let us pass through the village"

 diggy_encounter.303.t:0 "The Unending Grudge\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.303.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]As soon as our messenger arrived at the dwarves’ doorstep he was attacked on sight. From the houses and fields dwarves poured over him, dismembering him within seconds. Seeing this an, even for us, gruesome display of blind hatred, we retaliated in kind, throwing ourselves into battle once again against our mortal enemies. Axe and sword, shield and bow, countless lives falling on both sides were the result of our well-intentioned idea of peace, but the fact that dwarves are stubborn idiots that cannot be reasoned with proves itself once again." #goblins and orcs get this from .300
 diggy_encounter.303.a:0 "No dwarf shall remain!"

 diggy_encounter.304.t:0 "Remnant Corpses\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.304.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Pouring into the opening of the village we overwhelmed the guards before they knew what was upon them. Axe and blade to throat, blood gushing over our maniacal laughter, teeth stained red. These dwarves had long lost their right to these caverns, and this shall be a reminder for them: The Serpentspine is under new management.\n\nAfter the heat of battle subsided we surveyed the slaughter field. No dwarf remained, only the mangled and disfigured corpses lie strewn around. The buildings are quiet now with the last signs of life slowly fading: Food on a stove, lit torches, unfinished clothes. Among these remains are also the riches the dwarves were hoarding Gems and gold, a small hoard amassed by the diligent workers."
 diggy_encounter.304.a:0 "Not just the men, but the women and children, too"

 diggy_encounter.305.t:0 "Our Remnant\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.305.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]An often overlooked quality of the Remnants is not that they just hid away, but that they managed to survive the unbelievable odds against them. It is no wonder, then, that this outpost would be of a similar tenacity. As we stormed the village, the dwarves burst out, armed with axe, blade, and shield, hacking our troops to pieces, killing them without much consideration."
 diggy_encounter.305.a:0 "The dwarves win again…"

 diggy_encounter.310.t:0 "Hot Bath\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.310.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Deep within the ruins of yore, the old dwarven structures that dot the caverns of the Serpentspine like stars in the sky of Halann, lie in wait, accumulating dust and spores. These ruins sometimes hide exquisite treasure, but often house extreme dangers, old and ancient foes. It was to our expedition's surprise, then, that the explorers scouting out one of these ruins found neither, instead they found what seems to be a dwarven bathhouse. Along the faint tiled floor and walls imagery of great waterfalls and rivers can be found, intricate depictions of long-lost aeons. In a corner of these murals, as well, is the manual on how to operate the bath. Many soldiers have not enjoyed a bath in months, so the idea of trying this one out is appealing.\n\nAs the water gushes through the pipes and fills the pool we notice that it gives off some steam, indicating that this was once a hot bath, presumably fed by an underground river near some geothermic activity. In a small adjacent cavern, we have found many valves and levers, seemingly regulating the heat of the water."
 diggy_encounter.310.a:0 "Let's see if we can make this more comfortable"
 diggy_encounter.310.b:0 "Everyone in, it's time to relax"

 diggy_encounter.311.t:0 "Perfect Temperature\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.311.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The old valves yield to our engineers, adjusting the water temperature until it is just right for us, giving off some nice steam, an inviting sight to behold. Many are already eager to try it out. One engineer points out another valve bearing the word 'pressure', which is apparently used to turn on some jets of water."
 diggy_encounter.311.a:0 "Turn on the water jets"
 diggy_encounter.311.b:0 "Now we finally get to relax"

 diggy_encounter.312.t:0 "Scalding\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.312.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Even though our engineer assured us that the valve was adjusted correctly, the stream of water entering the pool was almost boiling, sending clouds of steam into the fissures beyond. The unfortunate soldiers who have already entered the pool had to vacate it immediately, escaping with ugly burns and an increasing distrust of our engineers."
 diggy_encounter.312.a:0 "Ouch! Aah, ooh, ouch!"

 diggy_encounter.313.t:0 "Relaxation\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.313.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]With both the water at the right temperature and the jets gently flowing across the pool, our men can finally undress and relax, something they have been looking forward to ever since our initial discovery. The increasing anticipation is now being washed away by the water, and cramped muscles, stiff from the endless walking, can finally relax.\n\nAs time goes on a few other toys are discovered, a small fountain at the centre and artificial rain from the pipes above. This happy occasion went on deep into what the Serpentspine offers as a night until everyone had their fair share of water. The expedition stayed for a few days more, sampling the relaxing water before departing again."
 diggy_encounter.313.a:0 "Reinvigorated we continue onwards into the depths"

 diggy_encounter.314.t:0 "Death Jets\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.314.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The pressure build-up over the centuries without use and maintenance was too big to be contained. Opening the valves even a bit made water shoot out of the walls with such intense strength that it cut into the flesh of some soldiers, who then got subsequent burns from the boiling hot water. Our expedition quickly jumped out of the water, their rest and relaxation cut short."
 diggy_encounter.314.a:0 "Maintenance IS worth the effort"

 diggy_encounter.320.t:0 "A Fuse in the Dark\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.320.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The especially remote parts of the Serpentspine are haunted by an eerie silence that permeates the hallways with a deafening nothingness. Every sound of steps, voices, or the odd falling rocks is like an explosion, alerting the silent stalkers that hide away in the dark. Due to the remoteness of these regions most dark dwellers are not known to any manual one might recover from the aeons past.\n\nOne of these monsters has suddenly come to the expedition's attention: an utterly silent creature, whose green, tall, and armless body makes barely a whisper even as it shuffles across the cavern floor. The sudden surprise had the guards ringing the alarm due to this unknown danger, and as the entity came closer it gave off the sound of a fuse burning, striking a primal fear into our soldiers."
 diggy_encounter.320.a:0 "Kill it before it nears"
 diggy_encounter.320.b:0 "If it explodes we need to get out of here!"

 diggy_encounter.321.t:0 "The Shuffling Menace\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.321.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]With the soldiers roused from their rest they ready their weapons for the expedition leader to give a signal on how to strike the creature: its strange, four-legged form, with nothing but small stubs for legs, makes our expeditionaries wonder just where a weak-point would be.\n\nThere are three ways to go about this attack, the leader reasons: Hit it from a longer range to protect the expedition, charge it and keep it from coming closer, or simply barrage it with fireballs to eradicate it utterly."
 diggy_encounter.321.a:0 "Bowmen!"

 diggy_encounter.322.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Our bowmen take aim, the slow movements of the creature making it quite easy to hit. Our arrows fly true, striking the creature in its elongated torso, making it stumble over its stubby four legs. When it hit the ground, the skin burst open, revealing gems and diamonds within. A few druids wonder over the strange biology of this creature and decide to study it further, pocketing the gems, before being reminded that all loot must go to the coffers, not some personal stash."

 diggy_encounter.324.t:0 "Slashed\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.324.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Repeated charges and retreats managed to distract the creature enough that it wouldn't explode, leading to a decisive victory. As it fell to the ground it burst open, revealing a large amount of gunpowder inside its body."

 diggy_encounter.325.t:0 "Shocked\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.325.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The barrage of fireballs striking the creature quickly obliterated it in an explosion at a safe distance from us. In the aftermath of the explosion, we managed to find valuable gems within the remnants of the body, scattered across the ground."

 diggy_encounter.326.t:0 "A Grand Finale\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.326.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Despite, or maybe because of, the magical barrage we subjected the creature to, it charged at us, its fuse-sound becoming louder and louder, until it reached the soldiers in some kind of super-charged state, detonating right in front of our expedition.

 diggy_encounter.330.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Transparent clouds of gas sometimes get wedged into the corners of Serpentspine, silently floating without disturbance for centuries. These gasses are often dangerous due to the lack of oxygen for poor travellers traversing the labyrinthine paths of the ancient caverns. One such bubble of gas has now enveloped our expedition, making many explorers and scouts dizzy from the lack of oxygen.\n\nBut since the gas is colourless and odourless there is no way for our explorers to know until it is almost too late. As the signs towards a gas being the culprit behind the increasing discomfort the expedition leader is presented with three options to approach the subject matter."

 diggy_encounter.333.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]During our search for a secondary way around the gas we have come upon a dead end, which, luckily, seems to end in soft stone, which we must dig away in order to continue, due to the increasing reluctance to return to the gas chamber and find another way from there."

 diggy_encounter.336.t:0 "Gas Deposit\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.336.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The digging went along splendid, removing the soft and diggable rock from the path towards fresher air. As the process continued, however, the rock became more and more porous, with small channels, bubbles, and tubes within the stones carried away from the sit.\n\nThis strange geological feature turned out to be a herald of a much larger underground gas reservoir, hidden deep within the porous stone, seemingly deposited here by the dwarves of yore. This immediately sparked despair among the party, given the futility of escape."

For the last few days, the caverns have been suspiciously clean, however, featuring spotless, smooth stone. This has alerted some of the more seasoned members of our expedition to the possible danger: the infamous Gelatinous Cube, a mindless creature made of oozing gel in the shape of a cube, scouring empty hallways like a large garbage disposal, digesting whatever junk they pick up with their potent acid.\n\nAnd sure enough, after a few more hours our scouts report of floating chests and swords further along the path, suspended within the almost translucent gelatinous mass of the Cube. A few soldiers, clad in whatever protective gear they could find, approach the creature now for further inspection. They argue how to go about this situation, putting two possible possibilities in front of the expedition leader: Dispose of the Cube entirely by burning it to the ground, or try to retrieve the loot from within the Cube without the danger of harming the treasure."

After some heavy encouraging - and promising them a greater share of spoils - one brave soul finally committed to the deed.\n\nHe covered his arm with as much cloth as possible, tying it tightly to him, and reached inside. Despite all precautions, he could still feel a faint sizzling but managed to pull some of the surface treasure out. The chests and weapons are still covered in the slime and ooze of the Cube, however, and he refuses to clean them on the basis that he has done enough already."

 diggy_encounter.344.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The promise of additional rewards for everyone trying to retrieve the loot has encouraged one brave soul to try and pull some loot out, which turned out to be a miserable failure. The Cube pulled the soldier into the gelatinous depths, floating around in its insides, desperately flailing for help. Angered, it starts oozing around, trying to devour more of our explorers, almost succeeding at one point, routing the rest."

 diggy_encounter.345.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Through deception and trickery we managed to contain the Cube in a makeshift “pasture” from which it can't escape. Contained this way a debate sparks to live what we should do with the Cube. Some got tired of constantly saying "the Gelatinous Cube" and decided to give it a proud and imposing name: Larry I the Gelatinous, Lord of the Depths, Duke of Ooze, Grandmaster of all Cuboids."

Despite its slow speed, we couldn't stop it rolling and oozing over a few unfortunate men, covering them with its acidic gel and inflicting serious chemical burns. After its short-lived rampage, the monster scurried off into the dark. The horrifying wounds it caused are more than enough reason to leave it be."

The cap has a strange oily shimmer to it, refracting the light of our lanterns and torches in strange patterns, like a puddle of oil.\n\nFor that reason, our head biologist has dubbed them "Oilcaps". They exude an alluring smell, which raises the cooks' interest as to whether they can be consumed safely or not..."

 diggy_encounter.351.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The mushrooms don't taste that good, but their effect is undeniable: Our men feel elated, ecstatic even. The mushrooms must have contained some sort of psychoactive drug, at least from the looks of it.

This invites others to join them in their revelry but just as a new group of mushroom-hungry men arrive, the first ones, who have eaten copious amounts of mushrooms by now, start coughing and their mouths begin to foam. They fall over with dull eyes, as if they have gone blind. This state of unconsciousness soon ends with death, the entire body slumped after an episode of intense twitching.\n\nThose that witnessed this threw the mushrooms away in disgust, but for some it was already too late.

Some of these creatures have turned upon others in search of sustenance, but no other does so with an uncaring ambiguity than the giant slimes dwelling in the pits. They creep up on unexpecting creatures, encasing them in their slimy bodies.

 diggy_encounter.390.t:0 "Stream of Despair\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"	
 diggy_encounter.390.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The unsteady nature and tectonic activity under the Serpentspine mountains has yielded grave results for our expedition. From one of the many openings to the side of the cavernway, where water had slowly trickled down in small drops, building impressive dripstones, came a low rumbling which heralded a deluge of brown brackish water filled with rocks and stones that pulverized upon hitting the opposite wall with the force the water had pushed them along. As this stream began to fill up the ground below us some of the expedition members grew uneasy with what might happen now, fearing that they might drown in this cave. There is no end yet insight, and no ascent away from the danger to be seen yet."

 diggy_encounter.391.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay] With a fast step, but still in formation, we traversed the cave while the water continued rising. Soon the black and brown deluge crept up our legs, filling shoes with small rocks, sand, and pebbles. Many soldiers now broke step, the difficult terrain making it hard to follow the others. Soon the water reached chest-height, which turned the uneasy into outright fear, with some panicking, since there was still no end to the hallway in sight. Finally, after thirty excruciating minutes of constant mortal fear we managed to find a path upwards. After leaving the water behind we had to find out that some stragglers did not manage to get out of the cave fast enough."

 diggy_encounter.392.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]With the troops at ease the water slowly rose, but since this hallway seemed so big any fear abated. And when the water seemed to halt about at ankle-height everyone became cheerful again and continued onwards. Then, suddenly, more parts of the wall gave way to the water masses, flooding the cave faster and faster as more walls broke done. Then a loud crack from above announced the end: The ceiling broke open, burying some under the fallen rocks, and the rest under the subterranean lake that came crashing down. Some managed to find small pockets of air where they could hold out for some time, but soon the oxygen became scarce and dizziness approached, ultimately suffocating those who had not drowned."

 diggy_encounter.430.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Drums beating, archaic dwarven language, sturdy armour, black-tipped spears: These are the signs of the Obsidian Dwarves, outcasts from Aul-Dwarov, heretics who have been exiled into the depths of the Serpentspine for their dangerous rune magic. Ever since they resurfaced some of them can be observed here and there in the Serpentspine, but not in such a large quantity. Before us are at least six legions of dwarves stampeding through the old caverns. This is not just another warband, this is an army!"

Their corpses lie now piled high in the cave where our battle had taken place, most of their armour and weapons shattered. There is still a trace of their strange magic in the air, like a static tingling. Next to them lie our own losses, equal in size.

 diggy_encounter.432.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Soon after we began our charge towards the legion we noticed our mistake. We had completely underestimated their numbers and their combat prowess. Their black spears and obsidian blades cut through our troops like a hot knife through butter. Without breaking formation, they fight back like a bulwark of pure hatred, like demons of the ancient world, without mercy or consideration. It was not long until our own troops faltered and broke formation, fleeing and retreating from the battle. After the threat had passed our soldiers returned from their hiding spots and the leader issued a head count to survey the immense losses."

 diggy_encounter.433.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]It would be akin to madness to face a warband this size, which means there is only one solution: Get out of their way. Quickly the soldiers and explorers disperse into the surrounding crevices as the rhythmic tread of the Obsidian Dwarves approaches. All hold their breaths, cower behind the rocks as the warband passes without looking around, much to our fortune. Once the danger had left us behind, we emerged from the caves again, glad that we chose to hide."

 diggy_encounter.435.t:0 "Rejoining the Main Force\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.435.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]After short and brisk negotiations the warband decided to accept our offer to join the main force again. They had been fruitlessly searching for a runestone from before the fall of Aul-Dwarov, but they couldn’t find anything. With their spirits already low they were happy to have finished their task and gladly return to our shared brethren."
 diggy_encounter.435.a:0 "Why would they have ever refused?"

 diggy_encounter.436.t:0 "A Refusal!?\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.436.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Negotiations were short and fruitless. The commanding officer quickly declined to rejoin the main force. “We are here not out of leisure, but out of necessity,” he told the expedition leader. “We search for ancient runestones, a task which is none of your concern.” Being so rudely brushed aside the expedition leader raised his voice about the futility of such a project, the dwarves of yore would have destroyed all of the obsidian runestones after the banishment. The negotiations then turned into a vivid argument, with both the expedition leader and commandant storming off to their own force."

 diggy_encounter.440.t:0 "Fungal Bloom\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.440.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The faint trickle of water echoes through the caves, its soft reverberations caught by a gigantic fungal bloom, yellow and violet mould that has overgrown the caverns around us. The fungus glows faintly, a strangely soothing display of iridescence. As our first scouts enter the hall the fungus shudders, sending waves through the mycelial crops. Soft, faint spores drifted away from the fungus and into the surrounding air. The scouts quickly stepped back out of fear the fungus might be deadly. But as they made their retreat the bloom released more and more spores, triggering some kind of chain reaction that quickly started filling the entire cavern with the yellow glowing particles. As if that was not enough, some fungi started exuding a sickly green gas that mingled with the spores."
 diggy_encounter.440.a:0 "We can’t risk it. Leave at once!"

As they made their way through the hallway more and more fungi released their gas, the eruption triggered by the soldier’s footsteps. Some unlucky ones who had inhaled the gas succumbed to a strange wheezing cough as well as becoming strangely tired. Soon the strange cave was behind them, though, and those who had started coughing recovered in time."

 diggy_encounter.442.t:0 "Engulfed by Gas\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.442.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]With every step more and more gas was released into the cave, filling the air with a green haze illuminated by torches and the luminous spores.

Then, engulfed in this green fog, strange sounds filled the cavern, an echoing rumbling that made many run straight to an exit."

 diggy_encounter.443.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Despite initial protests the expedition leader decided to wait out the gas, but soon something strange stirred unrest. Slowly people started coughing and then falling over, lying prone on the ground. A cleric immediately went up to them and tested for their pulse. With closed eyes he counted the beat but then got startled by a loud snore emanating from the fallen soldiers. This was grounds for much confusion. What are these spores and gas? And most importantly: Will they ever wake up?"
 diggy_encounter.443.a:0 "Only time will tell"

 diggy_encounter.444.t:0 "A Long Rest\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.444.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The fungi let out an insane amount of gas to the point it has become ridiculous. The first theories about how the fungi are maybe just cork stoppers for a large reservoir of gas below have taken hold. Soon, however, the first soldiers started to fall over, sparking some unrest. As ever more fell to the ground the medics did not know what to do, where to focus their attention when, almost unisono in a grand chorus, all started to snore. It was a cacophony of diverging cadences, a noise so encompassing that the echo itself seemed to shudder, multiplying the sound over and over again until it sounded like an earthquake rolling through the cavern."
 diggy_encounter.444.a:0 "How can they sleep through that noise?"

 diggy_encounter.445.t:0 "Functional Masks\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.445.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]With some cloth, strings, and water we have managed to create makeshift masks to cover our mouths and noses so that we can safely traverse the cave.

 diggy_encounter.446.t:0 "The Masks Fail\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.446.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Despite our masks made of cloth and string the gas managed to seep into our noses, making some soldiers fall over.

 diggy_encounter.450.t:0 "Rainbow Clouds\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.450.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Lying heavy on the ground like a fog the trench in front of us is filled with a brightly coloured gas, violet and green, blue and yellow, a rainbow of opaque mists. Not trusting the serene colours, one of our scouts throws a stone into the clouds. As soon as the stone hit the rock below the gas detonated in a huge explosion of similarly many colours."
 diggy_encounter.450.a:0 "This bodes ill"

 diggy_encounter.451.t:0 "An Explosion or Two\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.451.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Threading along between the many bubbles of gas the expedition tried their best not to enter any of the bubbles while there were many audible explosions further away in the trench. There was a chain reaction brewing somewhere in the dark, only illuminated by the sudden bright light of combusting gas. Some people started to lose their way, cut off by the gas. When they finally reached the other side, they could see how a rolling torrent of explosions made its way through the trench and across, leaving nothing in its wake."

 diggy_encounter.452.t:0 "That's a Lot of Damage\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.452.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]It took the expedition tremendous focus to navigate the trench, resulting in heavy losses from lost members, somewhere within the untraceable trench. As more gas slowly filled the caves a faint roaring of continuous explosions could be heard far away, announcing a terrible chain reaction that made its way towards the expedition. Fuelled by fear and desperation many more lost their way, never making it to the other side as the explosions rolled in, disintegrating anyone who was still amidst the gas."
 diggy_encounter.452.a:0 "Only so few left?"

 diggy_encounter.460.t:0 "Cobwebs?\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.460.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]In the tunnel ahead, a particularly bendy and tight passage through the underrock our soldiers came upon what at first seemed to be cobwebs. Thin white strands laced the walls and blocked the path forward. Upon some initial inspection the material turned out to be extremely easy to break. This made many reluctant to just walk through, waiting for the expedition leader’s assessment of the situation."
 diggy_encounter.460.a:0 "Let’s get some mages on this"
 diggy_encounter.460.b:0 "Sweep it away!"

 diggy_encounter.461.t:0 "Fire Resistant\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.461.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The mages take a small sample of the cobwebs, putting them through some tests. After 15 minutes they came back with their results: The crystalline structure is fragile and brittle, but fire resistant. Its chemical composition is akin to other silicates, dominated by magnesium and oxygen. With those tests made, they consulted their books and came to the terrific conclusion that this material must be the phyllosilicate chrysotile, a mineral of the serpentine subgroup, better known as Asbestos. Walking through it would have had disastrous consequences for our soldiers that could disable them until the end of their life."

 diggy_encounter.463.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]When the first soldiers started coughing no one suspected anything. Then, later, more and more soldiers were packed by fits of dry coughing and shortness of breath. The expedition had to take breaks more and more often. Some started complaining about how hard the recent days were, some had trouble swallowing. After a week of symptoms here and there the expedition leader called a meeting to discuss what to do. Since most people were still healthy and those that were coughing slowed the expedition down significantly it was decided to send the sick back home where they could receive a proper diagnosis and care."
 diggy_encounter.463.a:0 "Surely it won't worsen"

 diggy_encounter.464.t:0 "The Relentless Grind\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.464.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Three days later everyone was coughing all of a sudden. Awful and disgusting coughs, trouble swallowing and hideous swelling on hands and arms. Exhaustion plagued the expedition, slowing it down tremendously. From one day to the other the entire party slowed to a grinding halt. Field medics and clerics were working full time to tend to the sick while still trying to figure out what had happened. After the first people died from what seemed to be asphyxiation the surgeon general decided enough was enough. If they don’t know what was going on then there could also be no help: Cut them open.\n\nThis proved to be a very controversial decision, but most acknowledged it had to be done. The medics disappeared into a tent with some corpses and began their work. Soon they had discovered what the problem was. The presumed cause of death was indeed asphyxiation, but it was induced by significant scarring of lung tissue through stiff white fibres lodged within."

 diggy_encounter.470.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Goblinoids are no uncommon sight in the Serpentspine with all the goblins and such. But there are some rarer sights that are rather unexpected, such as bugbears, hulking, furry menaces which stand at the top of the goblinoid hierarchy. They enslave other goblins, raid, plunder, feast, and lie. A band of such creatures, clad in crude armour and armed with spiked clubs and maces, has been on collision course with us for the past few hours, as our scouts report. Quickly the expedition leader assembles a small council to debate how to approach this threat. As further reports come in the situation becomes clearer, but also more dire: There is a surprising amount of them, and they have an entourage of goblins as well."
 diggy_encounter.470.a:0 "That’s just more corpses! Charge!"
 diggy_encounter.470.b:0 "Let's make a show of force! Scare them off!"
 diggy_encounter.470.c:0 "We speak goblin. They speak goblin. It’s worth a shot."

 diggy_encounter.471.t:0 "Pest Removal Services\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.471.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The crude armour of the bugbears are no match for our axes and swords, which are forged with great care and attention. Our shields and plate resist their meagre strikes. While full of brute strength they lack the finesse needed to really pose a threat to us. As soon as their underlings notice how their masters are butchered they disperse and flee into the surrounding caves like the cowards they have always been. Soon the battlefield falls silent, the bugbears slain, fur clotted with blood, maces broken, armour shattered. A victory!"
 diggy_encounter.471.a:0 "I wonder if their fur sells for anything"

 diggy_encounter.472.t:0 "Savage Bugbears\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.472.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]The savage and primal strength of bugbears is nothing to be scoffed at, they wield their weapons with such overwhelming force that even our strongest shields splinter upon impact. Our screams mingle with their battle cries as the rest of their goblinoid underlings attack as well from the flanks, leaving us without proper formation. The bugbears charge into the ensuing chaos, their maces crushing bones and severing heads through pure, brute strength alone, a terrifying display of nature. As the few who are left from the skirmish hide in the caves, they see the goblins rifle through our fallen comrades’ pockets, nicking gold and other precious materials to present them to their furry overlords in a strange display of reverence. At last, they continue onwards, leaving the battlefield abandoned. "
 diggy_encounter.472.a:0 "They put the bear in Bugbear"

 diggy_encounter.473.t:0 "Almost Too Easy\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.473.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Our superior tactics and peerless discipline quickly scared the bugbears. As the first fell back from the horde their underlings retreated as well, causing a mass hysteria that resulted in a fleeing army. Still, this wasn’t just any uncoordinated flight, this was more of a retreat, which meant they knew where to retreat to. Let us follow them to wherever they wish to hide and maybe we can find some more loot there, or at least slaughter them for good."
 diggy_encounter.473.a:0 "They sure do seem to know their way around the terrain"

 diggy_encounter.474.t:0 "A Show of Strength\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.474.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Falling back for a moment to regroup we prepared a powerful show of strength. By increasing our combat width, filling out the entire width of the cave, putting on grim faces and standing just slightly on our toes we managed to look like an impressive force, almost like a small army in its own right. This accomplished what we wanted. As soon as the bugbears turned the corner towards us, they froze in place. Insecure looks left and right; they were quickly routed and fled without a single drop of blood wasted."
 diggy_encounter.474.a:0 "As they should!"

 diggy_encounter.475.t:0 "Unimpressed Bugbears\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.475.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Our clever ruse to make us look like we were stronger in numbers than we actually were has not impressed the bugbears at all. They laughed and scoffed at us and began charging with far greater anger than expected, fuelled by contempt for us since we tried to deceive them, a mistake they took very personal."
 diggy_encounter.475.a:0 "Our only choice left is to fight"

 diggy_encounter.476.t:0 "Bear-ing Responsibility\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.476.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Sitting across a makeshift table that was really just a convenient boulder on the side of the hallway, our expedition leader and what seemed to be the biggest, furriest, loudest, and strongest bugbear began negotiations. Our leader laid out some options for a peaceful coexistence, which the bugbear considered, giving some input on his side. After a few minutes of intense back and forth the chief and the expedition leader came to an agreement. The bugbears would settle the surrounding vicinity, claiming it for us, and in exchange they would be mostly left alone and could keep their slaves. All in all, an agreeable result."
 diggy_encounter.476.a:0 "Do they know what taxes are?"
 diggy_encounter.476.tooltip:0 "Bugbears are strong, their tribe is sure to make good workers after we secure the area"

 diggy_encounter.477.t:0 "Negotiations Fall Through\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.477.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Despite our expedition leader’s natural charm and charisma the negotiations soon fell short as a fight between a scout and a bugbear broke out. What started as a standard disagreement soon escalated into a shout-out. Just before they had started fighting, we intervened and put an end to this. From then on the negotiations were cold and the bugbear chief reluctant. To no one's surprise he said now, but still left us with some meagre supplies as a sign of good faith before continuing onwards."
 diggy_encounter.477.a:0 "Oh well"

 diggy_encounter.478.t:0 "A Heroic Defence\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.478.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Outmanned, outmanoeuvred, but not outfought! The bugbear onslaught was fierce and vicious but, in the end, they could not deal a serious blow to our forces. As we broke through their lines and even defeated the ambush, they had prepared just in case someone followed them, with ease. This opened the way into their den where they kept the numerous riches they had acquired over time, a hoard of gold and jewels, old dwarven artifacts, and strange remnants of past battles."
 diggy_encounter.478.a:0 "Take it all!"

 diggy_encounter.479.t:0 "Ambushed From Above\n[EncounterOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_encounter.479.d:0 "[EncounterOverlay]Suddenly, as we turned around a corner, the bugbear force had vanished. The place where we had expected them to be was abandoned, devoid of anyone, or anything for that matter. Slowly we made our way into the hallway. Then suddenly the sound of a horn announced our doom: From above the surprisingly stealthy bugbears jumped on us, breaking our formation and slaughtering whoever they could get the rusty maces on. Cries and screams echoed through the halls, metal clanging as bones broke under the impact of the raw strength of the bugbears. In the end they left us lying, broken, like a discarded toy."
 diggy_encounter.479.a:0 "A terrible slaughter"
