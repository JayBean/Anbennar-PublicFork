To connect guests and travellers to the Ynnic plateau, a wide, winding staircase hugs the tower's walls, twisting and turning as it rises around the pillar, all the way to the upper floor parallel to the Cliffs of Ruin. On the walls, a diagonal mural accompanies the staircase, depicting episodes of elven history from the War of Broken Chains, to the Ruin of Aelantir, to the landing of Munas to Endrallian's rediscovery of Aelantir in 1500 AA.\n\nWhile scholars are still at work uncovering secrets of elven history and, as they do, they are bound to find inaccuracies with some of the mural's portrayals, none can deny its artistic power: guests often travel the entire length of the tower without realizing, engrossed as they are in following the mural."
