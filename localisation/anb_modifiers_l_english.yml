 desc_m_arca_noruin:0 "Standing majestically on the western side of Venaan's Tears, Arca Noruin is a large castle complex built close - but not directly adjacently - to the Cliffs of Ruin. Its keep, with a hundred floors and several attached towers, links at the summit with the Ynnic Plateau by a drawbridge. On foggy days, it is not possible to see the top, nor to see below from the top; for this picturesque quality, it is also nicknamed "The Mistpiercer"."
 m_arca_venaan:0 "Arca Venaan"
 desc_m_arca_venaan:0 "Arca Venaan, more than a structure, is a love song to the elven race. A spiral tower of the most lucent teal, it has been decorated with floral patterns, waves and clouds on the outside. Its interior is wide enough to allow an open atrium, at the center of which rises a marble pillar with the statues of important elves carved onto its sides. To connect guests and travellers to the Ynnic plateau, a wide, winding staircase hugs the tower's walls, twisting and turning as it rises around the pillar, all the way to the upper floor parallel to the Cliffs of Ruin. On the walls, a diagonal mural accompanies the staircase, depicting episodes of elven history from the War of Broken Chains, to the Ruin of Aelantir, to the landing of Munas to Endrallian's rediscovery of Aelantir in 1500 AA.\n\nWhile scholars are still at work uncovering secrets of elven history and, as they do, they are bound to find inaccuracies with some of the mural's portrayals, none can deny its artistic power: guests often travel the entire length of the tower without realizing, engrossed as they are in following the mural."

 desc_m_arbeloch_ascensor:0 "A long slope has been dug directly into the Cliffs of Ruin to allow a rail platform to travel through. Using hydraulic power harnessed from the nearby river, the platform rises and descends along its kilometers-long path, moving unperturbed like the hand of an giant. While not the most glamorous or extravagant of the cliff passages, the Arbeloch Ascensor is the fastest and safest way to get through, being able to lift heavy cargo or several regiments per trip in a state-of-the-art feat of engineering efficiency."

With humble beginnings as a dwarven meadery, a particularly frigid winter in 1304 brought ruin to honeybee populations in North Rahen. Unable to produce honeyed liquor, Brûndskâppa transitioned to more practical brews, such as healing draughts, painkiller tonics (later confirmed to be pure grain alcohol), and minor stamina-enhancing potions. Though often diluted with booze or water, potions originating in Khandi serve as a lifeline for adventurers and clinics alike, offering useful boosts or first aid to the injured."
