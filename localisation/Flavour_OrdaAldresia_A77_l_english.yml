 flavor_orda_aldresia.1.d:0 "The Orda Aldresia (meaning Aldresian Order) was founded after the Aldresian Crusade, when the knight Aldresia led valiant warriors against the undead hordes of the White Pestilience, driving the crusade into the heart of Corvuria and defeating the lich and former acolyte of the Sorcerer-King, Cancrec the Defiler. Since then the Orda Aldresia has safeguarded Cannor from undead and other evil threats using the highly secretive art of Diranbe, bladedancing: the ability to cast spells with a blade as if it were a wand.\n\nThe Order was also instrumental in helping found the Empire of Anbennar in 1221, and eventually turned into the personal bodyguards of the emperor, who they saw as the embodiment of justice and fairness in Cannor.\n\nObviously that has not always been the case, and the order stagnated from chivalrous knights saving all of Cannor to token bodyguards for decadent emperors... until now.\n\nThe High Rectorate has made Aldresia the first ever non-deity saint in the Ravelian Church, and the order has shifted its focus as vanguards of the Ravelian faith."

 flavor_orda_aldresia.2.t:0 "Sentinels of the Empire"
 flavor_orda_aldresia.2.d:0 "When the 4th Lilac War began, we held to our oaths, raising our blades and banners for the one true Emperor: Grand Duke Adenn Skylance. Kind, charismatic, and chivalrous, the Grand Duke of Dameria had little trouble convincing us to follow him into battle.\n\nFor two decades, we fought for him without question. Had he ordered us into the hells, we would've followed him with a smile. Some would call it fanaticism or zeal, but any knight worth their salt would've seen it for what it was: true belief in a dream of a safe and peaceful Anbennar. Yet no matter our resolve, no matter our oaths, we failed a great man.\n\nWhen now-Emperor Lothane assaulted the Imperial Palace at the end of the Lilac Wars, and killed then-Emperor Adénn Skylance, there was widespread denial amongst our order. For a full year, we withstood his overtures at attempting a peace. The Wexonard had sense to not approach Arca Aldresia, as we would sacrifice our entire order to cut through his army and take his head.\n\nBut, with time, there has been discontent growing within Aldresia; a question of our purpose, with some even claiming we've betrayed our oaths. Few are friends of Lothane, but we are Sentinels of the Empire, and Anbennar is more than just one man. \n\nLothane has sent a final messenger to us, asking for our return without conditions. We must uphold our duties once again, but will our order survive it?"

 flavor_orda_aldresia.3.t:0 "A Heretical Order"
 flavor_orda_aldresia.3.d:0 "In recent decades, a new faith has taken root within Orda Aldresia, stirring concerns amongst the Empire of our loyalty. With religious conflict spreading across Anbennar, many in the Imperial Court have pushed the Emperor to reconsider our duties as their protectors. A day ago, a dove arrived to Orda Aldresia’s headquarters with a message: either forsake our faith…or forsake our oath. What will we choose?"
 flavor_orda_aldresia.3.a:0 "The Emperor is mortal, the divine transcends them!"
 flavor_orda_aldresia.3.b:0 "We will not forsake centuries of duty!"

 flavor_orda_aldresia.4.t:0 "The End of an Empire"
 flavor_orda_aldresia.4.d:0 "For centuries we have protected the Emperor and Empire from threats, both external and internal. Centuries of heroes and brave knights kept the dream of Anbennar alive: and, for a moment, we believed victory was imminent. That dream died in our last battle. We lost the war to protect our Oath, and now we, too, are lost."
