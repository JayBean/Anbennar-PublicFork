 flavor_orda_aldresia.1.d:0 "The Orda Aldresia (meaning Aldresian Order) was founded after the Aldresian Crusade, when the knight Aldresia led valiant warriors against the undead hordes of the White Pestilience, driving the crusade into the heart of Corvuria and defeating the lich and former acolyte of the Sorcerer-King, Cancrec the Defiler. Since then the Orda Aldresia has safeguarded Cannor from undead and other evil threats using the highly secretive art of Diranbe, bladedancing: the ability to cast spells with a blade as if it were a wand.\n\nThe Order was also instrumental in helping found the Empire of Anbennar in 1221, and eventually turned into the personal bodyguards of the emperor, who they saw as the embodiment of justice and fairness in Cannor.\n\nObviously that has not always been the case, and the order stagnated from chivalrous knights saving all of Cannor to token bodyguards for decadent emperors... until now.\n\nThe High Rectorate has made Aldresia the first ever non-deity saint in the Ravelian Church, and the order has shifted its focus as vanguards of the Ravelian faith."

 flavor_orda_aldresia.2.d:0 "When the 4th Lilac War began, we held to our oaths, raising our blades and banners for the one true Emperor: Grand Duke Adenn Skylance. Kind, charismatic, and chivalrous, the Grand Duke of Dameria had little trouble convincing us to follow him into battle.\n\nFor two decades, we fought for him without question. Had he ordered us into the hells, we would've followed him with a smile. Some would call it fanaticism or zeal, but any knight worth their salt would've seen it for what it was: true belief in a dream of a safe and peaceful Anbennar. Yet no matter our resolve, no matter our oaths, we failed a great man.\n\nWhen now-Emperor Lothane assaulted the Imperial Palace at the end of the Lilac Wars, and killed then-Emperor Adénn Skylance, there was widespread denial amongst our order. For a full year, we withstood his overtures at attempting a peace. The Wexonard had sense to not approach Arca Aldresia, as we would sacrifice our entire order to cut through his army and take his head.\n\nBut, with time, there has been discontent growing within Aldresia; a question of our purpose, with some even claiming we've betrayed our oaths. Few are friends of Lothane, but we are Sentinels of the Empire, and Anbennar is more than just one man. \n\nLothane has sent a final messenger to us, asking for our return without conditions. We must uphold our duties once again, but will our order survive it?"

The vote was all but certain, Prince Adenn Skylance, Duke of Dameria, would ascend and usher in a golden age for the Empire. However, the midnight before the elections, on the 5th of Bloomsdawn, 1422,  Lothane sil Wex, Duke of Wex, attempted to assassinate Prince Adenn Skylance, kicking off the Fifth Lilac War. In the weeks after, as allegiances were declared and skirmishes commenced, Skylance arrived at our order’s ancestral home, Arca Aldresia, and sought our aid.\n\nGrandmaster Delian sil Arrannen, childhood friend of Prince Adenn, was zealous in his support for the true Emperor and declared Orda for the Moon Party, much to the rancor of those wanting to stay neutral. In 1424, those dissidents abandoned our cause to fight the raging Greentide to the north, nearly sending us to collapse, but the leadership of Delian preserved our order. We fought valiantly, we fought fanatically, but we failed, and in 1443, Adenn Skylance was slain by Lothane sil Wex.\n\nWe held out for a year, until the summer of 1444, being the last members of the Moon Party to surrender. We expected to fight till our last breath, as the Rose Party armies mounted outside Arca Aldresia’s siege. But in the end, Grandmaster Delian surrendered, humiliating and infuriating our order, that bent the knee to the usurper.\n\nWe now barely stand, a ghost of our former glory. Half of our order had left to fight the Greentide, the other half were slaughtered in the Lilac War. We serve an Emperor who usurped the rightful heir of the Empire, and Grandmaster Delian has all but abdicated his responsibilities in leading us. Our order is in a crisis, time will tell if we will survive."

An Aldresian Knight, middle aged yet with no more insignia than a recruit on his scarred armor, answers the challenge with a blade drawn, drawing shouts and murmurs.\n\nThe senior Aldresian Knight who flung the insult steps forward with her own blade drawn, fully gray hair in a ponytail and wearing a battle worn commander’s plate armor. Both pushing forward and meeting face to face, their blades inches away from each other’s throats as they howl obscenities. Each accusing the other of betraying their oaths; of failing to protect the Emperor or failing to protect the innocent.\n\nThe entire Orda watches as Grandmaster Delian arrives in a rare appearance, lucid from his usual absent demeanor, as he marshals order back to the knights. Both prideful warriors return to their factions as the Grandmaster departs, leaving the Aldresian Senior Council to bridge the growing schism.\n\nFor decades we have fought a war outside the walls of Arca Aldresia, and now we fight a war within. Younger battle hardened knights bristle at their status in the face of the older aging leadership. Called The Greentide Generation, they wish to make Orda Aldresia an effective fighting force, but the resistance of elder knights is proving difficult to them. What will we do?"

Delian tried to ignore him. Emperor Lothane had declared an afternoon recess but Aldresia’s Knights never rested.\n\n‘I guess you’ve earned it in a way. You did join the winning side…at the end.’ Crovan winks, calling forth a spark of anger in Delian, and for the first time in awhile, a whisper from his blade.\n\n‘But I mean, you did still support a feckless loser for a while, a false Emperor by the name of…Brokenlance was it? Should’ve come to the right side, like Wesdam did.” The Grand Magister continued.\n\nThe whispering blade started to rouse, growing desperate, hectic, shouting internally.\n\n‘Ah well, we’re allies now aren't we? No harm…no foul.” Crovan laughed, turning around as Delian’s blade screamed in his hilt.\n\nDelian lightly touched the pommel of his blade as Crovan stopped. A daring brow raised from the Magister as the Grandmaster breathed deeply. Delian’s blade, Bloodbrother, howled for a bloody duet that the Grandmaster never joined.\n\n‘Thought not.’ Crovan cackled as the Grand Magister left leaving Delian alone in the throne room."

 flavor_orda_aldresia.10.d:0 "The capital city glistened in morning dew as storm clouds threatened a second burst of rainfall against the Aldresian knights' march to Anbenncost. All the city, from peasants to noble alike, had come out to see the bustling and loud clanking of the proud second sons of the Empire march in perfect formation through the main street. Delian sat atop a horse, wearing the battle scarred armor he donned during the Lilac Wars and looked like a maiden’s fantasy come to life.\n\nThe Grandmaster had sent a larger regiment to the Emperor’s capital for more practical protection but the Anbenncost garrison would be crucial in securing the Aldresians’ prestige and status in the Empire. The first challenge in this would be securing Emperor Lothane’s trust, if he didn't plan any treachery against the order who nearly went extinct opposing him.\n\nDelian’s entourage found the gray-haired Emperor standing atop the palace’s steps, arms crossed with vicious eyes staring down at them. Delian had grown up in the Imperial Palace, running and playing with Adenn as boys. But Adenn was dead, and his home lost to a Usurper who didn’t deserve any of his brothers’ blades.\n\nAscending the steps, his eyes locked to the Emperor’s, a murmur spread throughout the crowd before a scream. Emperor Lothane’s stone face turned to that of war as he drew a blade and Delian turned toward the commotion. A quarter of his retinue had drawn their sabers and bounded up the steps, shouting a clear and desperate plea.\n\n‘Down with the Usurper!’\n\nDelian’s hand reached for his blade as the rest of the order awaited his action. With a moment’s hesitation, he drew his blade and confronted his brothers."

The Grandmaster stared at himself in the mirror, black hard eyes, salt and pepper hair, with a growing five o’clock shadow.  He was handsome once, when he was barely eighteen summers and the object of affection for a lovely Esmari young noblewoman he spent many nights with. A child was born of that tryst, a daughter that had been lost to time.\n\nWere it not for Adénn vouching for him to be inducted into the Orda Aldresia, he would not have escaped punishment from the brutal Esmari lord. Ironically, it was Adénn who introduced him to her. All he had, he owed to Prince Adénn. A brother, no- a prince among men, an Emperor…that he failed. And now he was to serve the Usurper, a tyrant by all measure who ravaged Anbenncost with unthinkable atrocity.\n\nCould he really do this? He was the last Moon Party war combatant to surrender, and his entire order nearly revolted against him when he threw open Arca Aldresia’s doors for Lothane. He fought to the eleventh hour and in the end, was it all for naught? But then again, how could he not have surrendered? Only a hundred of the garrison remained, young and scared second sons who were high off of bravery, eighteen year olds as he had been, who did not deserve death.\n\nAs he tapped the pommel of his blade, Bloodbrother, he stared toward the mahogany door in front of him.\n\nNo, he can’t give up. He can’t let the dream of Anbennar, the dream that Prince Adenn spoke of, die like this. Not to a brutal tyrant, or from his own ambivalence. He had to rebuild his order, keep the peace, seek to somehow sideline this usurper and find Adenn’s son, Prince Rogier; now the true Emperor of Anbennar, missing somewhere in Escann. He had to fight… he had to fight!"

He hadn’t been lucid like this in a while, not due to magic or any medicine, but of his own internal struggles. The aging Grandmaster stood up as he stared at the neatly creased letter in his hands. He had to get this letter sent, no matter how small the possibility of success this could be.\n\nA crash outside sent his hand snapping to his sword as he swiveled forward. What was that? A servant? An assassin? With a breath, Delian rushed out with blade in hand, as he came across a knight, scrambling against the wall with a dagger in hand.\n\nThe Grandmaster looked up and down the fledgling knight. He was young, a pendant of the Silmunas on his necklace. The man’s name was Valan, he held Delian in contempt for letting Adenn die. He wasn’t wrong to feel that way. Before Delian could call for guards, he heard light footsteps behind him.\n\nThree shadows emerged from the darkness with blades drawn. Delian could see their faces in the moonlit castle hallway. They were young, the few who wished to die to Lothane rather than surrender to him, but most of all they were scared. And they outnumbered him.\n\n‘Grand-Grandmaster, for betraying the rightful Emperor Adenn Skylance, you are sen-sentenced to death!” One squire, barely fifteen summers, choked out.\n\nDelian exhaled, looking unblinking into the frightened eyes of these assassins.\n\nThey tried to speak, but his voice silenced them. ‘I am a second son who failed my brother, my order, and my Empire. Nothing you could say I haven’t told myself a thousand times over!’ The Grandmaster roared defiantly, drawing his blade."

One was to recite their oath once again, renewing it to affirm their commitment to the values of Aldresia. For most Grandmasters this would have been a formality, but for Castana sil Hardwick, this was an argument for her reign.\n\nWith the passing of the controversial Grandmaster Delian sil Arannen, followed by multiple and notable short reigned Grandmasters, the Emperor personally picked Castana sil Hardwick against the wishes of the Order to serve as leader. She seemed like a respectable choice, she had been in the order for a decade now, arriving to join at the age of seventeen after escaping her arranged marriage. However, she hailed from Wex, where many Aldresians still bear a grudge for the death of Adenn Skylance.\n\nAs Castana finishes her oath, she stands up and turns to the gathered knights before her.

But the tides of fate have shifted, and our rivals in the Magisterium are scrambling to oppose our march on Oldtower. Even the duplicitous snakes of Wesdam petition the Emperor, but they receive no answer.\n\nWe arrived at the crack of dawn, half of our order in shining armor, polished blades, and eyes of eternal vengeance, staring down the feckless mages cowering behind their ‘grand’ tower. The Grand Magister sent sternly worded letters to us and begged at the imperial court to intervene but we’ve undercut them in all manners of diplomacy.\n\nThe Magisterium gathered their own war mages, ready for the confrontation, but we stepped past across the border and found no fight. We are not sure if we’d be successful in taking the tower, but we’d die trying to, and the mages understood our fervor. They teleported out as we reached the top of the tower, raising our own flag and cutting down theirs. Wesdam, true to cowardly form, sent no relief force to help the mages either.\n\nOf concern however, as we delved into Old Tower’s archives and confiscated many of the Magisterium’s curious artifacts, was a revelation that shocked us. Half burned letters sent to many Magisterium court mages of Imperial Electors and even minor princes, detailing a plan to usurp their rule! An outrageous plan, but an even more outrageous claim! We must investigate, gather proof of this treason. We are in a fight for not just our own order but for all of Anbennar. We cannot fail."

More Aldresian patrols nearby arrived on scene as a full battle broke out. Magical steel clashed against fangs and superhuman strength.\n\nDozens of Aldresian Knights fell, but hundreds more of this inhumane horde shattered against their resolve. Three of these beasts remained, less feral, and appeared to be self preserving. The captain and her great host chased the three into the forest, cornering one who resorted to an all out assault. More powerful than the horde, it slew half of the retinue before finally being felled by a lone squire who stabbed it through the heart with a wooden stake, felling the fiend.\n\nThe survivors recounted the battle as best they could to our shocked order. It took days for us to come to terms with the truth, but soon, a fire lit in our hearts. Our purpose, more than being bodyguards for the Emperor, was to vanquish evil and the undead.

The first challenge that met them was a moving maze, holding living chests and shifting hounds, out for blood. The second was a large cauldron, demanding only the worthy to drink from it; the irony being that one had to swim into the poisonous liquid and pull a lever, unlocking a shut gate. And lastly, the most chilling, was the hordes of silent undead, waiting almost obediently for any intruder to approach.\n\nHells, they were dabbling in necromancy! What else were these duplicitous and ruthless mages planning? Madalena exhaled as she slowly and cautiously stepped forward into this final chamber. Piles of gold caught her eyes, but a second daughter of Verne was no stranger to wealth. She approached the middle of the chamber, as the small chest hanging from a chain at the top nearly made her heart skip a beat.\n\nShe….she had only read about this in her books.

We had matured into efficient hunters.\n\nThe ‘battle’ lasted barely a minute as Conric and his knights blinded the vampire and drove a stake through its heart, paralyzing it. In our interrogation, we learned an alarming amount of information of vampirekind. Vampires organized into complex clans, had special bonds between a ‘sire’ and a ‘childe’, and were more than just the feral beasts we thought them. They fought amongst each other, significantly intelligent, but above all had an innate need to hunt, else they’d turn bloodcrazy.\n\nAllegedly, an organization of vampires had grouped together, the first of its kind in Corvuria. The vampire originated from there, but was banished for opposing the will of a powerful clan who had recently taken a more aggressive posture.

Second sons and daughters of the Empire in their shining armor evaded all the eligible second in line bachelors and bachelorettes from different noble families. The Knights were recruited from the same pool that were present below, but their centuries old oath restricted them from entertaining any…foolery of the sort.\n\n‘Must we suffer this every year?’ A voice came behind the Grandmaster.

He spotted one Knight, barely twenty summers with scattered whiskers, stone facedly ignoring the gaze of a raven haired third in line daughter of Leslinpar. The two knew each other long before the Knight had arrived. The young woman visited every year and waited for the Knight at the ball, refusing all others.\n\nThe Knight caught sight of the Grandmaster staring at him, glanced back at the young woman who immediately straightened her back, and looked at his liege for guidance.

Dark clouds rolled over Dostanor as our garrisons were assaulted in the night. Sanguine creatures of unthinkable ferocity slaying our righteous knights as a nightmare descended upon the land. The Umbral King took his place, sitting atop the throne in Bal Dostan as he exulted in defiance.\n\nWhatever remaining spies we had, sent their last messages; that dozens of vampire clans had arrived to bend the knee as the Umbral King sought to march on the Empire as Canrec the Defiler had centuries ago. But there is no young squire Aldresia to save us as a dark lord musters his forces. There are no heroes left that guarantee our victory.\n\nThe Empire is absent, still refusing to believe our pleas despite all evidence. Our allies have gone silent as well, diplomats sent to rally them have gone missing. We are alone once again as Grandmaster Delian was in 1444… perhaps this will be an even fight for the Umbral King.\n\nWe are the Empire’s second sons. We are knights of valor, of honesty, of justice.

As we don our helmets and draw our blades, every one of us can hear the singular oath that unites us being whispered in determined unison while the Umbral King cackles on his blood throne."

Supporters of ours ripped to shreds or hanging from rooftops by their entrails. Pools of blood ran slick through the streets, covering the cobblestones, as vampires rallied out in the open with noble hosts.\n\nWe were no longer facing beasts of myth, but living and breathing horrors. Already we spotted a thrall force with several vampire lords ready to sally out from the gates. And beyond, atop the silhouetted castle of Bal Doston, a few keen eyed Aldresians spotted the figure of the Umbral King, wearing a crooked crown, surveying his realm.\n\nEven the gods are absent for our struggle, but it does not matter. For forlorn children of not just great houses, but of the faith itself, need no help. By the strength of our own conviction, shall we banish this terror.\n\nWe must decide how we will breach the city.

We lost several commanders in the market as they fought to the last, slaying the remaining thrall. The north and west were fortified by powerful vampiric clans, but our War Clerics were unshakeable in their faith. We pushed their self proclaimed barons and dukes into Arca Corvur’s churches and set the buildings ablaze, cleansing the city of their evil.\n\nIntense urban fighting slowed our attack, but the Grandmaster and his advisors took the initiative, breaking through the lines as they sprinted toward Bal Doston. A fireteam of the most elite Aldresians, they reached the walls of Bal Doston as they contemplated how to breach the storied castle.\n\nWar Cleric Lexos suggested to go behind the castle to the south side, cutting through its gardens to find a service entrance while the Grandmaster contemplated the unthinkable, assaulting from the front and catching the vampires off guard."

The leader of this insurgent vampiric group hissed seeing the blade but stood its ground, making no hostile moves.\n\n‘We are no ally of the Umbral King. We want this warlord gone as much as you.’\n\nThe Grandmaster tilted his head in confusion but the vampire crossed his arms.\n\n‘He sits in his throne room, cornered and feral. Will you deny our assistance at the eleventh hour?’\n\nThe Grandmaster looked back to his battered party, they had lost one of their own and half of them were at death’s door. They had to finish the fight.\n\nStepping forward, and turning toward the door, the Aldresians and the Vampires marched united into the throne room of the Umbral King."

The Grandmaster stepped forward reciting the Orda Aldresia’s oaths as the warlord bellowed a cruel laugh.\n\n‘Really? Reciting your oath? How pathetic, this is no fairytale-’ The Umbral King harangued before stopping short, his eyes snapping to the drawing of Aldresia’s shining blade, Airgesein, by the Grandmaster. The knight finished his oath as he pointed the fiery weapon at the warlord.\n\n‘Do or die, Aldresian.’ The Umbral King challenged.\n\nThe clash was legendary, vampires allied to Aldreisans fighting a decadent and bloodthirsty king. But with a false step, an advantage pressed, in under a minute Airgesein was ran through the Umbral King’s heart, felling the terrible foe as dawn came.\n\nBut just as immediately as the Umbral King was defeated, had the vampires turned against their once allied Aldresians. Only a young squire was able to escape to tell us of the tale. We would later learn these vampires were a part of a greater organization called The Blood Court who had been locked in a centuries long war with the Umbral King. But with him gone, they reigned unfettered…or at least they think.\n\nWe learned much from our battle against the dark warlord. Blood Court, bloody kings.

I will find you. No matter where you are, no matter what challenge restricts you. I will not let all of this be for nothing. It can’t be for nothing, I refuse to let it be so. You will live in Arca Aldresia alongside me, take lessons in knighthood, or choose your own path, but so long as I know you're alright.\n\nI depart in a week’s time, with a thousand knights to find you.

By the next year, we raised our banners in revolt yet again, being the last Moon Party member standing and surrounded on all sides by half the Rose Party, led by Wesdam’s host. But fatefully, as our numbers dwindled to barely a hundred, Grandmaster Delian controversially surrendered to the Usurper and brought the remnants of the resistance to an end.\n\nArca Aldresia suffered a terrible siege during that period, with our stockpiles severely depleted. If we do not replenish our stores, we will be unable to seek out our restoration as the Empire’s royal knights."
