For most of Castanor's history, the death of a Castan would trigger a scramble for the Trialmount and the Trials, as aspirants competed for the right to become the next Castan.\n\nThis was the way for centuries, until the Gerudian Ebonfrosts wrested control of the Trials for themselves, instating a policy where only the direct heirs of the Ebonfrost dynasty were allowed onto the Trialmount to take the Trials. We are at a crossroads, as the first to succeed in the Trials in many centuries. With the Trials reinstated now, what shall be our policy?"

 castanortrials.101.t:0 "The Trials of Castan"
 castanortrials.101.desc1:0 "The Trials of Castan - a tradition and mode of succession unique to Castanor - was established in 618 BA. The near-mythical Castan the Progenitor, slain during the First Great Cleansing years after defeating a gnollish invasion headed by the demonic Xhazobine, left behind an interregnum period fraught with uncertainty. The able Castan Beastbane would take up the mantle of Emperor after establishing the Trials of Castan, a series of tests designed to determine a worthy successor for Castanor. Each successive Castan had to pass the Trials left behind by their predecessors, while adding their own test to the Trials at the end.\n\nThe Trials continued on for centuries, until the Sorcerer-King brought Castanor crumbling down with his ambitions on the rest of Cannor. His final defeat came at the Battle of Trialmount, where a band composed of Free-Realm heroes and their elven saviors defeated the Sorcerer-King. The Trials were irreparably damaged during the battle, its magic either drained, severed, or otherwise rendered useless. Or so everyone thought, at the time.\n\nTo restore Castanor, the first human empire and master of much of Cannor for centuries, our ruler must pass the Trials of Castan, as every ruler of Castanor has done in the past. Starting from the gates of the North Citadel, the traditional setting off point for the Trials, [Root.Monarch.GetName] readies [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for what would surely be a long and arduous journey."

Finally, it was Beastbane who cleaved deeper into the Salahad, through the heartland of the gnolls, and pushed his Legion into the demonic gates leading to the gnoll homeland itself, sacrificing himself and his men to close the gates forevermore.\n\nBeastbane's trial was simple in concept - hunt down a beast in the Trialmount forest, bring its carcass to the very slab of stone in this nondescript clearing, and craft something useful from the beast's remains.

 flavor_castanor.1.desc:0 "The legions of old Castanor were something special - their dominance with spear and shield was simply unmatched. The glittering white of the legions is iconic, and no Castanor can exist without replicating these marvelous signs.\n\nNo reborn legion will fully resemble the old, for the age of the spear and shield has long passed in favor of rifles and gunpowder. Through careful deliberation, there have emerged two distinct schools of thought on how the legions might evolve to handle the modern world.\n\nThe first argues to make use of the plentiful manpower reserves of Escann; that every soldier ought to have three or even four men ready to take his place should he fall, such that any enemy of Castanor is bled dry through warfare at a scale they cannot hope to match. Producing enough arms and ammunition for a force of this size would be extremely difficult, if possible at all, though proponents argue that an army of 'good enough' will inevitably win out against a company of elites, especially if three more armies are able to intervene.\n\nThe second camp effectively desires the exact opposite of this; to create a smaller elite force. They argue for priority to be placed upon ensuring every soldier is versatile and well-adjusted to line warfare, that every soldier has the means and the desire to fight for days at a time without cessation. That this would hurt manpower is no secret, but proponents stress that all soldiers require the investment to be as effective as required."

With his manipulative malice quickening the downfall of Castanor, the bewitching of the incumbent Castan just the start of his plans.

The mage emperors of Anbennar were able to impose peace for a time, but even that came crashing down in the wars of rule. Furthermore, the trifling election of a magically gifted five year old child to the Anbennar crown further sowed the seeds of instability, which led to the Lilac wars.\n\nSo, why mages? Why allow them near our crown, why allow them to join our glorious Legions in their magnificent restoration when they could be blamed for stamping out our dreams once before? But many have nowhere else to go since the Crimson Deluge, and the sharp rise in magical ability and mages that came with it. They have flocked to the Dragon Banner of Castanor to learn how to control their powers, to rise up from whatever hovel they may have come from, to seek glory in the arms of service and possible redemption in the eyes of their village, city, and empire. For traditional mage schools are selective, expensive, and frown upon those of non-established bloodlines. The legion however, took them in, fed them, taught them, and became their new home filled with camaraderie and fellow hood. Giving them a place to rise from the ashes, like a dragon, and flourish in a new age.\n\nThe Mage Bound are organized into battalions of legionnaires with platoons of mages mixed in. Some mages fight more akin to a traditional legionnaire except with ensorcelled weapons and enchanted armour. Each holding gemstones bristling with power, and sparkling with warding when killing blows glance off of them. Fire and lightning flickering from weapon and open palm as they cut down their enemy. Others fight in robes and with staves that can shift the movements of the land in earthquakes, or bring the skies down on their enemy with thunderous lightning, torrential rain, or vicious dust clouds to erode the enemy to death. All standing side by side with their fellow legionnaires as they make a crushing advance through the enemy ranks, each blow lessening their shame, and bringing them closer to redemption as they serve the rising star of Castanor, as it climbs to new heights!"

For an enemy general can send many to their death without an army faltering, yet who will replace the commanders when they are gone?

 castanor_fleet_to_rival_reavers_desc:0 "Perhaps the most fatal mistake of Late Castan's Empire was neglecting early warning signs from the north, as the reavers of Gerudia slowly stepped up their raids and started penetrating deeper and deeper into Castanorian held lands, culminating in the usurpation of Castanor by the opportunistic Ebonfrost dynasty.\n\nIf nothing else, we must learn from history the importance of a strong fleet, to both deter attacks from the descendants of the reavers, protect our traders and settlements, and, someday, wipe these raiders out completely. First, to build up a fleet that can penetrate into the fjord-protected lands of the Gerudian Coast."

They had Cannor in their fingertips, and even managed to defile the spirit of Castanor through a conquest of its throne. As technology has advanced, they have become more and more of a piece of history, a legacy and little else besides. Though a legacy can have power, theirs is one that lacks any true substance. Some of them even cling to the notion that they still hold the fearsomeness of their older counterparts.\n\nPerhaps, as the flag of Castanor is raised over Olav's land, they will see the error of their ways and the futility of their resistance."

No matter how strong their mother bear might be, it is weaker and more feeble than the mighty Castanorian dragon!\n\nSlay the bear and prove to all watching that piracy is not to be tolerated. The world watches - do not disappoint!"

 castanor_build_gerudian_citadel_desc:0 "Gerudia is a harsh land, bordering on uninhabitable at its worst moments. This makes total pacification very difficult - our garrison forces can find little in the way of warmth and will often freeze to death in their attempts to stop raids from Gerudians, who know how to find respite in this rugged environment.\n\nNo more. A citadel must be commissioned, one which our forces can sally into the countryside from. It shall be built of gleaming white stone, stark against a legacy of Black Ice. It shall be a place of warmth, a citadel against the chill foremost, and it shall be the place from where we truly take control of Gerudia."

 castanor_fold_in_gerudians_desc:0 "Like all before them, and all after them, the Gerudians must become Castanorian. Though they already speak Common, they do not live, breathe, die, Common. The best virtues of Gerudian must be extracted and taken for our own, and the negative - the rest - melted away and reforged as proud Castanorian.\n\nThough the lands of Far Gerudia are far indeed, their distance shall be offset by the presence of a citadel, from which Castanorian shall slowly spread out as the locals embrace our superior ways.\n\nThough many locals will find the change objectionable, they will certainly be swayed through the best virtues of Gerudian already present in Castanorian. If they do not, then it is of no consequence - they are not going to have a choice in the matter."
 castanor_fold_in_the_gerudian_effect_tt:0 "The greater our §YNaval Morale§!, the easier it will be to integrate the Gerudians, who have braved the Giants Grave Sea as fearsome Reavers and peaceful traders both for generations.\nCurrently, all owned provinces of that culture will get the following modifier:"

 castanor_reaver_legacy_desc:0 "The Gerudians were many things. At once a people focused on family and focused on warfare and pillage, a people of community and a people of heroes. Born into the harsh, inhospitable north, they were forced to keep communal, for their communities were all that could keep out the cold. The terrain is harsh, and yet they used that to their advantage; they went unconquered for centuries, until Castanor made its triumphant return,\n\nFor all their greed, the unbridled avarice that saw the Ebonfrosts destroy old Castanor, the Gerudians are a virtuous people - and, as with all, Castanor prospers from the inclusion of virtues. The last piece of any such integration is to add their values to our own, such that we are stronger than ever before."

 castanor_gnomes_underfoot_desc:0 "In the elden days of Castanor, the old Hierarchy of perfidious gnomes challenged our ascendancy. Though they were wary of directly confronting us, their riches flowed into the coffers of our republican rebels at the time - a decision that soon backfired when the latter transformed to a great power which rivaled both Castanor and the Hierarchy.\n\nAlthough the Hierarchy has since been devastated by the Dragonwake, there are still those who wish to bring it about once again. This cannot be allowed, and once we are done with them, they shall never dream of such pretenses again."

Free trade, smuggling, and piracy have greatly diminished the relative wealth of Escann; we must take stronger steps to ensure that the benefits of Aelantir continue their proper course to Castanor. To this end, establishing enclaves of loyal Castanorian patricians in key trading cities will facilitate a dependable monopoly, resolving the growing trade imbalance in our favor."

Their most immediate successor state of Lorent, with fabled knightly orders of the highest quality, proved their prowess in their success in the Lilac Wars and broader dominance of the region for centuries. We must not underestimate them, for all their soft appearances, and carefully bring them under Castanor's rule - and perhaps their lands might serve as a foothold for further interests in Aelantir, should we desire."

 flavor_castanor.200.desc:0 "£icon_castanor_dragons£\nThe coronation of a new Castan, the first in centuries, was bound to raise some difficult questions for those with the greatest connection with the storied past of Castanor, the Castonath patricians. It seems that they have split into two main factions on the thorny issue.\n\nOne such faction decries [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s actions, fearing that the reestablishment of Castanor would lead to an encroachment of imperial authority upon the patricians to an extent that Castellyr and previous successor states could never have wielded. Though weak, they are rapidly gaining support among the patricians, ever worried about their own wealth and influence. Nominally, they cite the old Proclamations of Castan the Progenitor, decrying the break in traditions and legacy that they believe [Root.Monarch.GetName] committed by taking the Trials without being of clear Castanite blood.\n\nThe opposing faction is headed by the matriarch from one of the oldest patrician families, and warns against any drastic action, believing that working with the crown is in the best interest of both parties."

 flavor_castanor.201.desc:0 "£icon_castanor_dragons£\nThe Edhardrachon - roughly Old Castanorian for Sons of the Dragon - are a loose society of patricians who grouped together to push their interests against the crown. For now, they just sit in their white spires and tall towers in Castonath, grumbling and not doing much else. But the patricians have deep connections and even deeper pockets. What's more, they hold intimate knowledge of and control in the great city of Castonath, the beating heart of Castanor. Who knows what will happen should they decide to put those resources to action?"

People went out of their way to avoid the mountain, an easy enough task for the most part, though just in case, [Root.Monarch.GetName] still ordered regular daytime patrols to ensure that the sanctity of the Trials were not disturbed.\n\nThese precautions made it all the stranger when reports of small disturbances at the Trials started surfacing. A set of footprints in the muddy path leading to the Oathstone, flashes of light spotted from the North Citadel… It was almost as if someone were scouting out the trials themselves."

 flavor_castanor.203.desc:0 "£icon_castanor_dragons£\nThe day dawns dreary, the streets of Castonath desolate in the wake of a thunderous storm. In the Upper District, home of the patricians, a porter hurriedly scurries from home to home, clutching in her hand missives delayed overnight by the storm. One such missive is marked and sealed with the tell-tale purple of one of the most powerful patrician families in the city. Paid for at a premium for immediate delivery, but was a porter to do, when it seemed like Uelos himself unleashed his tears on the City of Stone last night?\n\nThe porter knocks, feeling small next to the towering stone spire that exemplified the wealthiest of patricians, but no response is forthcoming. She timidly opens the door to a grisly sight: the battered, broken body of an old woman, eyes lifeless at the foot of the stairs.\n\nThe investigation was a short one, for it was well known that the matriarch was getting up there in age. The simplest explanation was surely the best explanation - a slip down the stairs, lost in the chaos of the storm. Nevermind that the one to have found the body, a nameless porter, had disappeared in the days after reporting the scene. The funeral ceremony was short-lived and under attended, for the matriarch had outlived every single one of her heirs. By law, her land would go to the crown, but this would surely draw the ire of many of her patrician peers, rivals and friends both."

The sky is perhaps just a little hazier and off colour than expected, the sun just a little hungover. And was that just a hint of a smoky smell in the air? Enough to leave [Root.Monarch.GetName] on edge, perhaps, but there was work to be done that day - documents and edicts to sign, decrees and orders to give. Best to put it out of mind.\n\nUnable to shake a feeling of unease several hours later, [Root.Monarch.GetName] leaves [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] makeshift headquarters - and right into confusion and commotion. Half a dozen couriers and messengers in various states of disarray are talking over one another to one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors, the poor hapless man trying to piece the story together.\n\nWithout question, the Edhardrachon have chosen a member of their own to take the Trials of Castan, finally having the confidence to declare [Root.Monarch.GetName] a illegitimate Castan.\n\nWhat happened next has been interpreted a thousand ways by a thousand different people: some say that the Edhardrachon chosen succeeded and the Trialmount itself roared its approval, shooting ash and fire a mile high. Others say that the Trialmount rejected such a blasphemous act out of hand, filling the air with smoke to prevent the Edhardrachon chosen from sullying the Trials while the previous Castan was still alive.\n\nNo matter the truth, the Edhardrachon apparently has much more power and influence than previously thought. To support their new leader, they have quickly taken control of Castonath and are even now fortifying its formidable walls, ready to fight for every last stone. The battle lines are drawn as the people of Castanor wait with bated breath - who will end up the true heir and successor to Castan and his Empire?"

It is a sound that the wood elves of the Deepwoods know all too well, these days, harried more and more as strange men emblazoned with a silver dragon relentlessly march. \n\nThe Third Great Cleansing started by necessity at the outermost and weakest edges of the Deepwoods, at the patchwork transition between the carefully tended and inhabited lands of South Castanor and the forest proper. At first, many of the wood elves who had for so long made their homes in the Deepwoods simply took themselves deeper into the forest. Many attempts had been made to tame the forest, of various magnitudes, and all had failed, afterall, and besides, the wood elves were not around yet when Beastbane carried out his cleansing. But as the conflagration spread, it was impossible to ignore this particular attempt, anymore. Many call for all out war against the trespassers, but more see this as an opportunity to free their society from the fickle fey, who have been respected and feared, but rarely venerated.\n\nAnd on the Castanorian side, many wonder about what to do with these lost cousins of the Moon and Sun elves, as encounters with hastily abandoned settlements and surprise guerilla attacks increase. Ridding the world of the insidious influence of the fey and beastly wilderness the Castanorians could justify, but the wood elves were an uncomfortable reminder of the true gravity of their task.

Andrel's expeditions revealed a world of few resources and uncivilized wilderness, clearly not worth bothering with for our nation. And yet, the expeditions kept being funded, as the court and Castan hung on to every new discovery.\n\nWord spread like wildfire that Andrel had finally returned with from a foray into the plains, his longest yet, and was requesting a public audience with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] with several short, white-skinned foreigners dressed in peculiar clothing in tow. Of course, it was granted, and the words spoken on that morning disseminated in a thousand settlements across Castanor by mid-afternoon. The expedition had finally pushed past the seemingly endless forests of the northern plains, chasing scattered Kukatodic stories of a massive sea to the east and cities of tens of thousands of humans - humans! They emerged from the forest onto the shores of a glittering sea, a sea as deep and vibrant in colour as lapis lazuli and stretching from horizon to horizon. And on that horizon, hazy in the morning mist, a solitary ship."

 flavor_castanor.80.desc:0 "£icon_city_of_stone£\nEntering Castonath's massive gates for the first time in thirty long years, Lianne Auern can hardly believe her eyes. This was not the Castonath she remembered, the Castonath that was her home for so many years, before she left to study and make herself known under the gnomish artificers of Anbennar and Western Cannor. Where were the squalid tenements, built over half-collapsed stone buildings? Where were the endless rows of lots more rubble than anything else, sitting as abandoned and empty as bird nests in the winter? The Castonath she knew was a child trying to fill in their older sibling's old clothes, comically out of place, its inhabitants weighed down by reminders of Castonath's past glory and splendour as they walked through too-wide streets.\n\nThis Castonath - this Castonath was brimming with an indescribable energy and verve. The sounds of construction and renovation filled the air, layering a comforting rhythm underneath the hawks of merchants and the ever-present chatter of the people of the city. More than two dozen dialects and languages provided the backdrop of this chatter, a clear sign that Castonath was attracting immigrants from across Halann. A city's lifeblood was its inhabitants, and Castonath was absorbing new ones as quickly as the parched desert sand soaks up water, greedily drinking after centuries of stagnation.\n\nLianne was not here just to reminisce and gawk, though. With a more critical eye, she found what she was looking for. Here and there were what appeared to be little spiderlike, mechanical familiars, scurrying back and forth and up and down buildings and walls. As far as Lianne could tell, these autonomous devices were doing tasks as varied as delivering messages, cleaning up stray marks and animal excrement, and conducting small repairs, sometimes all at once! These were work of an independent artificer union within the city - one that Lianne was tasked by the Gommo to report on. This was far from the only invention spreading through Castonath, however, in this perfect storm of Castonath renewal and explosion in magic for the people. Maybe Balgar's careful perfection of old could not be approached by mere mortals and was condemned to slowly decay over time, but perhaps artificery could bridge the gap. This was an age of new ideas, of innovation and progress. Castonath presented challenge and opportunity both - could the old City of Stone be brought into the Age of Artificery? And now that Lianne had seen all this for herself... maybe she could arrange for a longer stay in Castonath than she originally expected."

The Grand Bazaar is once again host to goods from the world over. The smell of Raheni spices permeates the air and exotic Aelantiri birds screech their sonorous cries through the air, while other more clandestine goods can be found displayed in the darker corners of the complex, ready to be whisked away from sight at a moment's notice.\n\nInformal communities have started to spring up like sprouts after a long winter, leading to the formation of different quarters in the Grand Bazaar. Halfling cooks sell their recipes to hungry workers in one such quarter, while dwarven smiths compete for customers in another. Though small at first, consisting of only the merchant and their closest families and friends, these communities are growing incredibly fast and attracting immigrants from all over, who take advantage of Castonath's many empty buildings and lots and recently cleared tenements in Lower Castonath."

Making the journey from Lower to Upper Castonath- or vice-versa, though few from the upper districts were too enthused to take that opposite route - was no small task. Travelers could walk up one of the many sets of stairs or take a rickety lift, sure, but heavier loads of goods or raw materials were bottlenecked, hampering connectivity between the lower and upper halves of the city and hindering industrial development.\n\nAnd so it was for centuries, until now! Several engineers and artificers have come forth with a plan to harness the power of the Silverfall for our own purposes. They speak of complex systems of lifts and pulleys to facilitate movement between Upper and Lower Castoanth, of directing the flow of the Nath itself to provide constant power for their workshops and experiments, and even of alchemical concoctions to clean up the stink and color of the river.

Approach at night however, without the clarity that the sun brings, and the city's walls are shrouded in the hazy dark. Instead, the Dragonforge draws the eye, the massive dragon's head atop the rolling hills of South Castonath lit by periodic bursts of flame from its ever-gaping maw.\n\nWhere does the intense and enduring heat needed to smelt so many tons of ore at all times of night and day come from? Perhaps only the late Balgar and his most trusted of Balgarsmiths, tasked with the upkeep of the Dragonforge throughout the centuries, knows. At least, until now! Scholars have theorized for centuries of a massive chamber of magma underneath Trialmount, the reservoir for the mountain's infrequent eruptions. Our scientists and artificers contend that a small offshoot of this chamber conveniently extends beneath Castonath - close enough for Balgar's mages to have set up long-lasting runic magic at the periphery of this arm that could somehow transfer just enough energy and heat to run the Dragonforge.\n\nBut, why stop with the Dragonforge? Imagine the whole of South Castonath, no, the entire city of Castonath, powered for free, even if indirectly, by Halann herself? Worth experimenting with, at least, and indeed, several artificers in the city have already started doing so, probing and testing the Dragonforge's design and limits. So far, this has culminated in the development of the Dragonforge Steamworks, an impressive complex that even now feeds many workshops and homes in South Castonath with pressurized steam, using residual heat and energy from the Dragonforge in a meld of runic magic and industry."

In the millennia since, it has turned into a veritable maze of old and crumbling buildings, its formerly pristine walls pockmarked and many of its alleyways blocked by heaps of rubble.\n\nAs Castonath has boomed, so too has the Crags.

Much of the district has fallen into disrepair or converted for other uses in the centuries since. One such development has been the formation of an 'University Square' in one of the largest staging grounds of the district, a square that has been booming in this age of artificery and enlightenment. Many of the former barracks surrounding the square have been converted into dorms for students, with few modifications. Similarly, many administrative buildings - the officer lounges and training quarters, debriefing and meeting rooms, among others - have been converted to classrooms and the like.

These particular spires were called home by only the richest of patricians, who could pay servants and slaves to do errands and serve their every need. The only time they needed to sully themselves by going to the streets below were when called upon by other patricians or when the Castan was in Castonath, but this soon also ceased to be a 'problem' as artificery took off and miracles became commonplace.

To walk through Pantheonway is to walk through the stained glass of Castanor's history - splintered and embellished as that history may be - each shard pieced together into a greater whole.\n\nDespite the greatest efforts of the patricians and their mages to preserve the district, however, Pantheonway is not immune to the vagrancies of time and the abuse of mortals who wander through. Statues gather chips and scratches, while the brilliant paint of mosaics slowly fades away through the centuries. To combat this, many patricians have pooled their resources and started the construction of a museum and collections complex.

We had the last laugh, however. During the Day of Ashen Skies, half of the city was flooded, and what remained was razed five centuries later, during the Dragonwake. And Castonath? True, our capital has gone through its fair share of ordeals, but it has emerged stronger. As for Damenath, it remains buried, as it should.\n\nThe Magisterium, that sorcerous cabal of would-be conspirators, has ruled from the piddling remnant of Old Damenath ever since they corralled the squabbling princes of Cannor into the Empire of Anbennar. But Anbennar is gone, and Castanor rules once more. Through the construction of the Old Damenath Citadel on the Magisterium's former capital, we have cemented our supremacy over the Dameshead and remade the Damesear in our image! With this newly made city - called Bal Damenath - we shall oversee the restless lands of former Dameria, and quash all opposition to our rule. And, unlike its predecessor, Bal Damenath shall never fall!"

Now that we have seized control over it, the agricultural bounty of Kheterata is ours, too, free to feed our people and our Legions. However, it would not do to leave it undefended. There yet remains a constant roiling plague of gnolls to the south, that ancient enemy of Castan II, the Beastbane, and we must remain constantly on-guard against that threat. Hence, we have repurposed the fort of Sorrowgate and rebuilt it into a citadel of Castanorian design, stamping our seal onto the land of the Khets forevermore!

Such was their potency that a Gerudian reaver had the temerity and audacity to claim Castanor for himself! That was a challenge that could not go unanswered - and we have answered it most satisfactorily. Gerudia is ours.\n\nKonungrhavn is the greatest city in Gerudia bar none. Untold numbers of vessels were built within its shipyards, and its sailors - who learnt the art of reaving - seized vast amounts of wealth from Cannor at sword- and axe-point. Konungrhavn is the gate to the Dalr Valley and its enormous timber and mineral resources, and since Aelantir was rediscovered, it has become a bustling port, trading extensively with that western continent. With so many merits, how could we not honour Konungrhavn by rebuilding it in our image? Yes, we have raised a Castanorian citadel here, the Coldgate Citadel, and it shall be named Bal Eldesgaht. Our Legions will sally forth from here to put down any resistance, especially from the monstrous trolls and other such giantkin that proliferate in the uncivilized, thinly-peopled regions of Gerudia - and woe betide those who think to challenge our rule!"

Indeed, locals claim there is the foundation of a citadel, one that was never completed, and has long been left left to ruin. Overshadowed by all other masterworks in the city, it would do us well to finish the job, and establish the Westsun Citadel there.\n\nAlternatively we might focus on the fortress of Azka-Sur, at Bulwar's eastern edge.
