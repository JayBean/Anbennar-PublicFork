 artifice_events.1.d:0 "There are three broad schools of thought, or philosophies, in how to approach artificery.\n\nThe Philosophy of Brilliant Inventions seek to fulfil the promise of true synthesis between magic and technology, blending the two into creating things entirely new and all the more capable. The Brillites see themselves at the forefront of the science of artifice, and it is no surprise that the most wildest and ingenious inventions come from followers of this philosophy. Their most famous invention is the Sparkdrive Rifle which utilizes elemental essence to shoot lightning with marksman accuracy.\n\nThe Philosophy of Techno-Thaumaturgy see artificery as a new school of magic, treating it through the lens of pragmatic mysticism as the common wizard would. They see artificery as a tool to bridge the gap between the arcane and the mundane, often using artifice to replicate spells without the need of complex rituals and reagents. One such invention are Wandlocks, allowing spells to be fired from the barrel of a pistol.\n\nThe Philosophy of Mechanism are engineers and craftsmen who combine artifice and traditional engineering know-how to push the limits of machinery. Mechanists stereotypically treat the more fantastical applications of artifice with disdain, believing in simple and effective artifice, especially when it can help with mass production. The Mechanists are proud that it is often their inventions that revolutionize society, such as Skyships.\n\nSupporting one of these philosophies will determine what Invention the Artificers hired by our state will create for us.

After all, is artificery not the future? If so, why are we stuck looking at the past?
