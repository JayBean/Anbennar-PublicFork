 artifice_events.1.d:0 "There are three broad schools of thought, or philosophies, in how to approach artificery.\n\nThe Philosophy of Brilliant Inventions seek to fulfil the promise of true synthesis between magic and technology, blending the two into creating things entirely new and all the more capable. The Brillites see themselves at the forefront of the science of artifice, and it is no surprise that the most wildest and ingenious inventions come from followers of this philosophy. Their most famous invention is the Sparkdrive Rifle which utilizes elemental essence to shoot lightning with marksman accuracy.\n\nThe Philosophy of Techno-Thaumaturgy see artificery as a new school of magic, treating it through the lens of pragmatic mysticism as the common wizard would. They see artificery as a tool to bridge the gap between the arcane and the mundane, often using artifice to replicate spells without the need of complex rituals and reagents. One such invention are Wandlocks, allowing spells to be fired from the barrel of a pistol.\n\nThe Philosophy of Mechanism are engineers and craftsmen who combine artifice and traditional engineering know-how to push the limits of machinery. Mechanists stereotypically treat the more fantastical applications of artifice with disdain, believing in simple and effective artifice, especially when it can help with mass production. The Mechanists are proud that it is often their inventions that revolutionize society, such as Skyships.\n\nSupporting one of these philosophies will determine what Invention the Artificers hired by our state will create for us.

 estate_artificers_artificer_generals_desc:0 "The reign of the War-Wizard shall be ended by the Artificer-General: an individual officer wielding concoctions, doodads, and innovations which can turn the tide of any battle. While the mages must rely on the lottery of birth for magical talent, we can equip the most-competent soldiers with the greatest inventions we can muster!"
 estate_artificers_relic_fueled_artificery:0 "Mana-Scholarship Harvesting"
 estate_artificers_relic_fueled_artificery_desc:0 "If an artificer asks you where progress is stored, you must respond, “In mana, and in scholarship.” We now harvest both as material goods: damestear as mana in physical form, and relics as stored cooperation with long-dead masters of magic. This will allow us to research significantly quicker."
 estate_artificers_focus_on_quantity:0 "Perfect is the Enemy of Good"
 estate_artificers_focus_on_quantity_desc:0 "We have crafted more inventions than we ever imagined: so many that we cannot use all of them at once. Therefore, by limiting our implementation of particularly powerful inventions, we can mass-produce many small boons to our economy, society, and military. By focusing on many "good" benefits to our country, we can outweigh the loss of sacrificing the fewer "perfect" ones."
 estate_artificers_gnommo_diplomacy:0 "The Gommo Client Network"
 estate_artificers_gnommo_diplomacy_desc:0 "The International Gommo, as the worldwide organization of artificers, has diplomatic relations with nearly every country on Halann.

 estate_artificers_precursor_weapons_desc:0 "There is a limit to how fully magic can be democratized through artificery. The magical science may be able to do incredible things, and put enchanted weaponry in the hands of the people: but without the materials required to produce those weapons, the power of artificery is purely theoretical. By maximizing our acquisition of damestear and relics, we can ensure that every soldier marches into battle with an artificed gun in hand."

 estate_artificers_grant_production_rights:0 "The Intranational Gommo"
 estate_artificers_grant_production_rights_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the global organization, we have organized the artificers, artisans, and nascent industrialists of [Root.GetTag.GetName] into "Gommos" of our own. Led by our country's finest minds, these guilds of the modern world create, construct, and invent with blinding efficiency, and earn us blinding profits. Our artificers may claim a large portion of these profits for themselves, but can such a price ever really tarnish our great progress?"
 estate_artificers_grand_exhibition_hall:0 "The Grand Exhibition"
 estate_artificers_grand_exhibition_hall_desc:0 "Unlike the mages of the past-- jealously guarding their secrets of magic, only occasionally demonstrating them to impress or scare the common people-- we plan to open a grand Exhibition Hall to the public. We will present our inventions and innovations to the world, thereby sharing scientific knowledge and garnering international prestige!"

 estate_artificers_trained_mage_hunters_desc:0 "Long has the terror of Witch-Kings plagued the lands of Halann, their immense personal power making meaningful resistance futile. However, with the dawn of new artificer weapons, we are able to train skilled mage hunters through the Magebane Project. The most skilled of soldiers are selected and trained to counter spells and suppress magic, wielding the newest tools designed by artificers to eliminate mages on the battlefield."

 estate_artificers_focus_on_artificer_units_desc:0 "Many battles have been won by fewer, but better-trained and better-equipped men. In this new era of war, the same will hold true. Our enemies may be able to field large armies, but those armies will fall to our own: for no amount of manpower can hold up to modern weaponry, firepower, and logistics. By placing emphasis on training and equipping artificers for combat, we can seize the advantage on the battlefield!"
 estate_artificers_development_tools:0 "The Arsenal of National Development"
 estate_artificers_development_tools_desc:0 "Unlike mage towers, which only benefit the demesnes of individual wizards, we offer a diverse array of new instruments to further our entire nation's prosperity. These tools of development will require incredible initial investments to produce, but will eventually pay off with dividends."

 artifice_research.1.t:0 "Committing to Progress"
 artifice_research.1.d:0 "Machinists, merchants, scholars, soldiers, alchemists, academics, bankers, and bureaucrats: all demand more funding for the artificers. The inventors of our country currently languish without state support, working on their own projects and struggling to make a living. Shall we infuse them with money and subsidies? Shall we give them our treasury, as long as they invent something for us in return?"
 artifice_research.1.a:0 "Let us fund the artificers!"

 artifice_research.2.t:0 "Deliberative Design"
 artifice_research.2.d:0 "The Techno-Thaumaturges, ready (as always) to debate endlessly over how best to design their next miracle, come to us with a question. Before they lodge their many potential projects in our direction, they must know what types of inventions we wish to see them develop.\n\nHappy as ever to deliberate and work with our administrators, the Techno-Thaumaturges posit the same three schools of study as they always do: industrial, military, or societal research.

Which invention do we invest in for the foreseeable future?"

 magic_artificery_setup.1.d:0 "A war-wizard is burned to a crisp by a faraway laser. A robotic laborer is fueled by damestear and grease. An ancient relic is deconstructed and finally understood. In short: scholars, engineers, philosophers, and inventors domesticate the magic of the world. Then, they place these magics into items that anyone can use.\n\nAll across the world, the age of artificery comes alive with a spark. For centuries, artificers have been seen as nothing but novelties: a strange little group of mages employed only by gnomes, then kobolds, then goblins. But now, as mass manufacturing and the scientific method take hold in Halann, artificers become more powerful than anyone imagined. With damestear, relics, ivory, porcelain, iron, steel, mithril, and more all traveling along sprawling new trade networks, inventions are created which shake magical societies to their core. [Root.GetTag.GetName] now must determine where it fits into this equation. \n\nSeveral possible approaches now present themselves. The first is to embrace artificery, stop all official patronage of mages in our society, and delve entirely into the science that we believe to be the future. Alternatively, we can reject the new art: instead of wasting our surplus of damestear and relics on some flighty vision of modernity, we can use these vital resources to empower our mages. Or, finally, we can try to combine the virtues of both: we would invest only partially into mages and partially into artificers, receiving the full benefits from neither while also allowing them to coexist.\n\nWe stand at a crossroads, and we must make a permanent decision. What does [Root.Monarch.GetName] choose? Are we to be a nation fully of artificers, fully of mages, or with a little bit of both?"

 magic_artificery_setup.2.t:0 "The Constitution of [Root.GetTag.GetName] Artificery"
 magic_artificery_setup.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has officially declared that artificery will be supported by the state. Now, we must figure out what this actually means. Three organizations, all vying to ingratiate themselves with nations across the world, petition [Root.GetTag.GetName] for official support. They each promise inventions and innovations the likes of which we could never imagine: and they each require funding the likes of which we do not want to imagine. We can only afford to patronize one of them, so our choice must be made carefully.\n\nOur first option, the Society of Brilliant Inventors, serves as the prestigious symbol of all artificery. They throw caution to the wind, giving their “Brillite” members full creative freedom: and with this freedom, they have invented the most iconic machines in Halann. Invest in them, and they might create revolutionary technologies like the Sparkdrive or the T-Wave Transceiver…  or they might get distracted, and come up with something utterly useless. To work with the Brillites is to put your trust into something that you cannot control.\n\nOur second option, the Techno-Thaumaturges, are the opposite: philosophers as much as inventors, they see artificery as simply a more scientific branch of traditional magic. Invest in them, and they will study while pulling inspiration from mages, administrators, and scholars alike. To work with the Techno-Thaumaturges is to have them slowly, deliberately, and conscientiously grind away at whatever the state wants them to.\n\nOur third option, the Mechanist Guilds, is a loose coalition of the artisans and engineers of [Root.GetTag.GetName]. Invest in them, and they will research decently quickly, and will let us have a reasonable amount of control over what their artificers create. To work with the Mechanists is to prioritize practicality.\n\nWith these organizations in mind: who does [Root.Monarch.GetName] choose to patronize and support?"
