Panic surged at her chest, but she stood quickly, reaching for the dagger at her belt even as the beasts closed in, breath hot against her skin.\n\nThere were too many.\n\nPain shot through her body as she was knocked down again. One of the beasts loomed over her, eyes glowing with a sick hunger. She fought against it, but her strength had left her.

His legs burned, his chest heaved with exhaustion, but he ran nonetheless.\n\nDominic had marvelled at the way the caverns had been decorated, painted with intricate art and carved with deliberate, ornate runes. He'd taken samples of the gritty, crimson varnish, careful to avoid damaging the unique works, planning to research its properties in depth once the party had returned to civilisation. Even when the pair had been separated from the rest of their group, Kalas's partner had eagerly ventured deeper into the caves, following barely-noticeable air currents and the gentle light of the fire they'd carried. Even then, they'd only split once, when Dominic had wanted to get a closer look at the strange quartz altar they'd come across.\n\nNow, mere hours later, Kalas ran alone. Loose stones and sediment threatened to bring him down, but he continued, wilfully heedless to what lay ahead of him.\n\n"Kal?! Please, Kalas, come back! Please!" Dominic's terrified cries echoed through the caves, still distant, but closer than before. Kalas gripped his ears, white-knuckled, and ran onwards.\n\nBecause whatever that thing was, it wasn't Dominic anymore."

 flavour_maskedbutcher.8.d:0 "With a grim smile, Royan took aim. The gun thrummed with power, gears whirring to life. He squeezed the trigger, and with a sharp crack, a bolt of energy tore through the beast's chest. Steam burst from the weapon as it hissed like a dragon. Another lunged at him from the side, but Royan was faster. This time, a spray of shrapnel shot forward, tearing into the monster's side. Blood splattered the walls as it crumpled, convulsing and shrieking.\n\n"Thought I'd hide forever, huh?!" He yelled, firing round after round - more energy blasts, more shrapnel, waves of heat that incinerated the creatures that got too close. The corridor began to stink of burnt flesh, but Royan continued to advance.\n\nAnd then, deep in the hold, he saw it.\n\nIts black skin was taut over rippling muscles. Its crimson glare behind Arianne's face dripped with cruel, calculated intelligence. Its deafening roar shook the very stone around them. This was the Otar. It had to be.\n\nRoyan had nothing left to lose.\n\nWith practiced fingers, he adjusted the dials to their maximum output, standing completely still as the monstrosity rush towards him. The first shot made it stumble. The second released a lick of flame, forcing a howl from the Otar's mouth as it cooked alive. He aimed one final time, feeling the heat of the gun in his hands.\n\n"Die." He whispered, and fired.\n\nThe shot was perfect. The force of the blast split the beast's skull with a sickening crack. It let out one last pitiful growl before collapsing to the ground.\n\nThe weight of the battle suddenly lifted. For the first time in years, Royan felt the sheer need to live. He couldn't die here. Not after everything. Not now.\n\nWithout a second more of hesitation, Royan turned on his heel and sprinted down the tunnel. His legs burned, but he pushed forwards. He had to reach the hold. He had to blast open the doors that had sealed them inside. Roars sounded in the distance, but Royan didn't stop. Not for the monsters. Not for the dead.\n\nHe was going to live."

He hoped they'd made it, hoped they'd escaped these accursed passages... but he couldn't dwell on that now.\n\nA faint flimmer of light, pale and distant, broke through the darkness ahead. The door to the hold, the one they'd found sealed behind them with thick stone, lay just beyond that light.\n\nThe snarling behind him grew louder. Royan refused to let them catch him.\n\nTearing the gun from his back, he span the dials so furiously that they detached from the barrel. The weapon groaned in protest, steam venting from its chambers, but he didn't care.\n\nHe aimed at the stone and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe blast was deafening. A brilliant flash exploded from the chamber, shaking the cavern, sending chunks of rock splintering off the walls. Royan coughed, stumbling back, shielding his face as the echoes faded.\n\nThe stone had cracked, just enough.\n\nLunging forward, Royan threw himself at the fissure, squeezing through the tiny hole. Every inch was a struggle against the crumbling rock, sharp segments stabbing and scratching at the remains of his armour until finally, finally, finally-\n\nHe made it.\n\nThe wind hit Royan's face, cool and sharp, carrying the scent of pine. The world seemed to welcome him - the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves in the breeze. The beasts scrabbled at the rock behind him, unable to give chase, their angered growling quieting as they retreated back to their pit.\n\nRoyan stood, the weight lifting off his shoulders. He felt the warmth of the sun on his skin. He let fresh air fill his lungs. His eyes scanned the vast landscape before him - the mountains, the valleys, the forests. All that the light touched."

The outer ranges never typically took that long to fly.\n\nA flicker of movement caught her eye. Finally. Far off, silhouetted against the darkening sky, she saw them. Five harpies, sleek forms gliding in unison, wings slicing through the air in practiced grace. Release flooded Thišši's chest... though something about their approach gnawed at her. Something was off. Munnephe was unmistakable with her ginger feathers, but they didn't quite catch the dying light as they should. They looked dull, almost muted. And, as they neared, her eyes... had they always been that cold?\n\nNo. Thišši shook off the thought. Perhaps they had faced something that had hardened them. Such a thing seemed likely, what with the chaos and unease that had been flooding the surrounding lands as of late. "Munnephe," she greeted cautiously as the harpies landed without a word, "What did you find?"\n\n"Nothing. The mountains are quiet." She sounded different. Flatter. More guttural?\n\n"Quiet? The beasts have been moving south for months. Surely you saw something." Vymaukyre's gaze snapped towards them, unnervingly intense.\n\n"We saw nothing. The land is empty." Thišši's heart began to race. Something was terribly, terribly wrong. She could feel it now, creeping over her skin like ice. Her sisters' eyes, their faces, the way they stood and spoke, the way they didn't so much as shift their wings as the freezing wind rushed past them.\n\n"You're not yourselves." She whispered, more to herself than to them. Munnephe walked closer, clicking her tongue as if considering something.\n\n"We are who we've always been." The words sounded wrong, like an echo of someone else's voice. Before she could move, the thing - because it wasn't her sister, it couldn't be - tilted her head. "Come, Thišši." The voice carried a twisted mockery of warmth. "The skies are ours again. We've returned."\n\nFrom behind her, the call went out. Cheerful voices, warm and welcoming, rose up from the nest. Thišši couldn't move, her blood running cold. They were too close. If she moved, they would tear her apart before any alarm could be sounded. So she swallowed, and stepped aside, watching the things step past her into the fading light."

Rumours spoke of villages already burning, of desperate calls for aid echoing unanswered in the distant mountains and hills. Time was slipping away.\n\nSomething had to be done.\n\nBefore him stood the vessel. An ornate lamp from the Salahad, surface gleaming with swirling engravings of a long-forgotten magic. Bound within was a power few could claim to have wielded. A Djinn. He has purchased the artefact from a ragged group of southern adventurers, their hands trembling with tales of how they had barely escaped the desert ruins where it was found. They weren't sure what it was. But Kyruš had known instantly.\n\n"Djinn, arise."\n\nThe air shimmed around the lamp, a cold wind stirring the room. From the vessel, a thick cloud began to pour, twisting and coiling into a mighty form. A voice, like distant thunder, rolled through the chamber.\n\n"Mortal. You summon me, Ekhar the Twice-Bound." Kyruš met its gaze. He had reheared this moment a thousand times, carefully considering his words.\n\n"I call upon you to intervene in the battle that approaches these lands. The invaders from the north - they must be slowed. Their advance must be halted." The Djinn's eyes narrowed slightly, considering the mortal before it.

As was he.\n\nAnd now, here he was again, standing before the mountains that had nearly claimed his life so long ago.\n\n"They're beautiful, in a... twisted sort of way, huh?" A voice piped up in his ear. Mila, a young human he'd taken as an apprentice, barely out of her teens. More fire than caution, that one; an amusing trait, but one that worried him more often than not.\n\n"They're death, girl," Royan replied, voice gravel, "And they've been waiting for me."\n\nBehind them, the party ran through a final check of their supplies. Cannor's finest, bringing adventurers from as far as the Broken Lands and the Torn Gates. They'd demanded a pretty penny, but Royan had seen the signs, heard the rumours. The rebellion was faltering.

Each shot was weaker than the last. Each was nothing more than a futile flicker of light against overwhelming darkness. The gun slipped from his hands, clattering uselessly to the ground.\n\nThis wasn't how it was supposed to end.\n\nThe beast came close, leaning down, face inches from his. Its breath was hot and rancid, its gaze merciless.\n\n"You ran. Coward." It growled, voice low and terrible. "And now, you crawl back to die."\n\nThe beast raised its fist, bringing it down on the gauntlet, smashing it into pieces. His hand, shredded and slick with gore, fell limp at his side. His vision blurred as it raised it again, barely catching the glint of the razor it now wielded.
