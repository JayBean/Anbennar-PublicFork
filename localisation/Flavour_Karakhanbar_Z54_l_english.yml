 flavour_karakhanbar.1.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] walks through one of the groves with a soldier by their side. The Emerald Orcs, led by the despicable Prince of the Blackened Branch, had shown no mercy in their attack. The groves are now littered with the bodies of goblins, elves, and orcs alike. As they approach a small clearing, the sound of fire intensifies.Accustomed to the roaring flames of the Black Hearth, they are almost taken aback by how calm and sombre the fire sounds. Stepping into the clearing, they are struck by the acrid smell of charred flesh and the sight of towering funeral pyres, surrounded by weeping mourners.\n\nStanding next to one another are groups of elves and goblins, with some orcs in their midst. They all stare blankly into the pyres as the fire licks the creaking wood, consuming whatever - or whoever - had been placed on top of them. Seeing the Feydealers, the soldier looks questioningly at [Root.Monarch.GetName], who turns to the young warrior and says…"
 flavour_karakhanbar.1.a:0 "Let them mourn, for they have suffered as we have suffered."
 flavour_karakhanbar.1.b:0 "Scatter them, but leave the pyres ablaze, we can use the fire to expand the clearing."

 flavour_karakhanbar.2.d:0 "Through winding paths of the Deepwoods, we have finally found the heart of the Forest."
 flavour_karakhanbar.2.a:0 "And riches within!"
 flavour_karakhanbar.2.b:0 "This marks the end of Fey dominance over the Deepwoods!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.3.t:0 "The Bald Peak"
 flavour_karakhanbar.3.d:0 "Mining operations allowed the Mountain Grove to prosper. However, our miners report, that they uncovered vast ammounts of crystals in Ciranmyn - perhaps instead of focusing just on metals we could excavate them?"
 flavour_karakhanbar.3.a:0 "These gems are truly outrageous."
 flavour_karakhanbar.3.b:0 "I would like to see them shoot emeralds from our cannons."

 flavour_karakhanbar.4.t:0 "Emissaries Return"
 flavour_karakhanbar.4.d:0 "After a year that seems like an eternity, some of our emissaries return. They inform about our temporal displacement, what happened to Greentide. Places they visited didn't believe in the war against Fey."
 flavour_karakhanbar.4.a:0 "We don't need the outside world."

 flavour_karakhanbar.6.t:0 "Loyal to Dookan"
 flavour_karakhanbar.6.d:0 "Though many shamans have preached that Dookan is dead, it couldn't be less true. Anyone who says that is an enemy of orcs that wishes to break our resolve and conviction for the Chained God."

 flavour_karakhanbar.7.t:0 "Establishment of Karakhanbari Engineer Corps"
 flavour_karakhanbar.7.d:0 "Our army is vast and powerful, yet to facilitate the process of turning the loot we have gathered to materials for our factories, we need skilled engineers to direct the process.\n\nWhile they are here, they could provide their expertise in warfare - question remains: Where should they focus lie?"

 flavour_karakhanbar.9.a:0 "We will grant you your wish, if you grant us your knowledge"

 flavour_karakhanbar.10.t:0 "A Mysterious Encounter"
 flavour_karakhanbar.10.d:0 "And the answer to the question lies in two places - first of them is Arca Corvur. There, dark magic of Corvurians and Korbarids have devised ways of taming the magic of Fey."
 flavour_karakhanbar.10.a:0 "Most intriguing."

 flavour_karakhanbar.11.t:0 "Dark Knowledge"
 flavour_karakhanbar.11.d:0 "We delve deep into the books and find information about Arca Corvur. It seems it won't be as useful as the courtier has said, unless we are missing something. The second place, where the anwser lies, what could it be?"
 flavour_karakhanbar.11.a:0 "We must investigate further!"
 flavour_karakhanbar.11.b:0 "Let us try to contact our "friends" in Anbenncóst"

 flavour_karakhanbar.12.a:0 "And so it shall."

 flavour_karakhanbar.13.t:0 "Surpassing Dookanson"
 flavour_karakhanbar.13.d:0 "Years ago, orcs of Deepwoods venutred there to flank Escann and attack it from south. After years of fighting, we finally realize our goal. At long last, Escannis fall under heel of Karakhanbar and they are not going to move from underneath it anytime soon."

 flavour_karakhanbar.15.d:0 "As ruler enters the renovated Arca Corvur, pondering about the power resting in this place, a young courtier starts a conversation with him.\n\n"And what must we give in return, spawn?"\n\nThe courtier smiles showing his fangs "Everything.""

 flavour_karakhanbar.15.b:0 "We will never be slaves!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.16.t:0 "Burning the Ashes"
 flavour_karakhanbar.16.d:0 "Ruler gathers workers and shamans at the site, where the World Tree was located. A great pit is excavated. After few days of work, workers reach a layer of soil littered with bones of animals. Sure, that they have reached the spot, Ruler orders to create a pyre akin to the Black Hearth and ignites it. In an instant it creates a heatwave that engulfs the terrain in flames. Shamans say, that in place of pyre they have found a crysal of powerful potency. It is inserted into the Black Hearth and the heat inside increases."
 flavour_karakhanbar.16.a:0 "We have bested the fey"

 flavour_karakhanbar.17.t:0 "New Faith Takes Root"
 flavour_karakhanbar.17.d:0 "Though we have already heard about these "songs of the wise" with our new state mereging, the notion of death of Dookan becomes ever stronger."
 flavour_karakhanbar.17.a:0 "Dookan is dead!"
 flavour_karakhanbar.17.b:0 "Dookan would smite us for our ungratefulness!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.21.t:0 "Fey Tricks Return"
 flavour_karakhanbar.21.d:0 "At first it started off as mere rumours. Feysilver coins appearing in pockets, animals turning into rainbow colours. Soon enough these rumours have been confirmed to be truth - yesterday a child was swallowed by a tree that has suddenly closed."
 flavour_karakhanbar.21.a:0 "Can we ever get rid of their tricks?"

 flavour_karakhanbar.22.t:0 "Eyes in the Forest"
 flavour_karakhanbar.22.d:0 "With our taming of the Deepwoods, the terrains started to feel safe. However, travelers report, that going down the lesser used routes, they feel as if something was watching them. Even worse, this feeling has affecter [Root.Monarch.GetName] too!"
 flavour_karakhanbar.22.a:0 "A: We can't be tired, the factory must grow!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.23.t:0 "Shadows Dancing"
 flavour_karakhanbar.23.d:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] talks to his soldiers, they report that South Castanor has recently started to be a little more dangerous. People don't feel safe, they report the "sense of impending doom"."
 flavour_karakhanbar.23.a:0 "Send more people to guard it. It's probably bandits"

 flavour_karakhanbar.24.t:0 "Missing Deliveries from South Castanor"
 flavour_karakhanbar.24.d:0 "Food, wood, medicinal herbs. All of this was sent to South Castanor and stone was supposed to come back. However our deliveries that exit the Deepwoods to the North don't seem to come back."
 flavour_karakhanbar.24.a:0 "Call the advisors to the war room!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.25.t:0 "The Ashen Reckoning"
 flavour_karakhanbar.25.d:0 "Sitting in the war room with his advisors [Root.Monarch.GetName] cannot focus on the matters presented on the table before him.\n\n“… caravans from South Castanor having significant delays, to maintain the quality of our rations I propose to acquire the grains from the Khet… [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] are you with us?” - the advisor asked. \n\n“Yes, yes.” - [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] replies. Ever since the ritual has been conducted in Oldhaven, many of Karakhanbari Orcs have complained over their inability to sleep, due to the constant feeling of being watched. Perhaps no one has felt this as strongly as [Root.Monarch.GetName].\nThe meeting has resumed not for long as suddenly an explosion of flames from the direction of the Black Hearth has filled even the war room with a wave of heat. [Root.Monarch.GetName] and their advisors have run out to the forge, maintained by Karakhanbari shamans. When they entered the room, they saw the lid of the forge swung wide open, and against the light of the flames inside stood a tall black figure, enshrouded in fire, with long arms and legs and a crown made of twigs.\n\n“Thou hast deluded thyself with triumph, believing thou canst revel upon my grave.” - it made a step towards the crowd.\n\n“Thou darest to think thou canst tame the untamable with fire, and ax.” - as the figure exited the leam of the Black Hearth, the fire on its skin gave place to pearly white skin, spotted in places by horrid black burns. Deep green eyes of the figure, slotted in regal, yet still youthful face transfixed [Root.Monarch.GetName] as if merely a blink of them could cause their soul to leave its current vessel.\n\n“I had but wished to restore the world to its ancient glory, yet thou hast wrenched that hope from my grasp. Cling to thy fleeting freedom while thou canst, for the hour of Ashen Reckoning draweth nigh and it shall brook no delay. No further bargain awaits thee - only death.”\n\nWith a flash of green light, the figure disappeared. The cold silence of the forge was only broken, when a wounded soldier, covered in blood, broke through the doors. As he fell to the ground, he whispered:\n\n“South Castanor is lost…"
 flavour_karakhanbar.25.a:0 "… the Prince has returned.”"

 flavour_karakhanbar.26.t:0 "Druidic Groves"
 flavour_karakhanbar.26.d:0 "The hordes of attacking Fey seem endless! However, our scouts managed to spot three places from where they come - Groves of ancient Fey Magic are being used to teleport the Fey into the Castanor. Perhaps by disrupting them, we can stop our enemies."
 flavour_karakhanbar.26.a:0 "Don't give up! As long as the Black Hearth burns bright, the fate for Karakhanbar remains!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.27.t:0 "Last Push of Deepwoods Vanguard"
 flavour_karakhanbar.27.d:0 "Today a bell tolls for Karakhanbar. As our vanguard marches forward, a terrible disaster has struck us. Remnant Fey Magic was used by the Blackened Prince to disable and almost destroy the Black Hearth."
 flavour_karakhanbar.27.a:0 "We can't give up! Not now! Not after what we have suffered!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.28.t:0 "Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust"
 flavour_karakhanbar.28.d:0 "Ruler is sweaty from the inferno that surrounds them. Suddenly a piercing shout breaks through the air and overpowers the roar of cannons. As Overlord fires his musket, he sees that Fey creatures desintegrate. Suddenly a wave of energy originating from Oldhaven sweeps through, puts out fires and heals the land. Overlord comandeers to return to the Deepwoods. The war with Fey is won."
 flavour_karakhanbar.28.a:0 "It is an age of steel and fire!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.29.t:0 "Darkness Gathers Over Capital"
 flavour_karakhanbar.29.d:0 "Scouts from [Root.Capital.GetName] reports of dark magic swirling around the Black Hearth with its last defenders sealed inside. If we don't take back the capital, a gloom future awaits us."
 flavour_karakhanbar.29.a:0 "Once more, into the breach!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.30.t:0 "The Reckoning Has Come"
 flavour_karakhanbar.30.d:0 "As armies of the Blackened Prince slaughter advisors of the ruler, they can only helplessly watch as the Blackened Prince destroys the Black Heart and comes to him to offer him the choice as his "consort" eternal."
 flavour_karakhanbar.30.a:0 "My ancestors... Our pride... has failed you."

 flavour_karakhanbar.31.t:0 "Fey Allure"
 flavour_karakhanbar.31.d:0 "Some of our armies are acting frivolous! We suspect they were enamoured by the Fey in the woods!"
 flavour_karakhanbar.31.a:0 "Cut them down!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.32.t:0 "Paths Lost"
 flavour_karakhanbar.32.d:0 "Our scouts report the magic of Fey we managed to subdue has reappeared once again! The paths our troops are marching on are winding unexpectedly. Our maps are useless!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.33.t:0 "Wood From Furnaces Disappeared"
 flavour_karakhanbar.33.d:0 "Forgemasters who smelt the metals into weapons of war report, that the wood they are throwing into kilns vanishes instead of turning into a charcoal."
 flavour_karakhanbar.33.a:0 "What?"

 flavour_karakhanbar.34.t:0 "Shamans Rally Warriors"
 flavour_karakhanbar.34.d:0 "Shamans preaching the truth about the strenght of true Orcs have rallied warriors to fight against the Fey."
 flavour_karakhanbar.34.a:0 "We could always count on them."

 flavour_karakhanbar.35.t:0 "Emerald Abductions"
 flavour_karakhanbar.35.d:0 "The villages have reappeared devastated and the people there have been turned to Emerald Orcs!"
 flavour_karakhanbar.35.a:0 "Are they still our kin?"

 flavour_karakhanbar.36.t:0 "The Trees Attack"
 flavour_karakhanbar.36.d:0 "While our troops were marching through one of our Groves, a group of Treants roused by the Blackened Prince has woken up, and they come, they come with roll of drum!"
 flavour_karakhanbar.36.a:0 "They will burn in our furnaces!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.37.t:0 "A Feyslayer"
 flavour_karakhanbar.37.d:0 "Despite our reputation on the international level and adventurers slowly losing their credibility, an adventurer from Greatwoods came to our court, claiming he will help us to put an end to the Prince of the Blackened Branch. As proof of his capability, he shows us the head of one of the lieutenants of the Prince."
 flavour_karakhanbar.37.a:0 "May your Orcish Soul guide you."

 flavour_karakhanbar.41.t:0 "Fey Disrupt Production"
 flavour_karakhanbar.41.d:0 "Fey have played their tricks and disrupted our production chains by destroying roads. We can alleviate this by expediting some of our soldiers to help maintain them so materials can reach their target at least somewhat on time."
 flavour_karakhanbar.41.a:0 "Send soldiers, our factories must run without delays!"

 flavour_karakhanbar.42.t:0 "Torrential Rains"
 flavour_karakhanbar.42.d:0 "Through use of their magic, Fey managed to engulf the Deepwoods in prolonged and concentrated tempests. Rising water has damaged many of our factories and stopped our works."

 flavour_karakhanbar.43.t:0 "Feymetals in Alloys"
 flavour_karakhanbar.43.d:0 "Though most of resources we gather are free of Fey taint, it seems one of the batches used to create an alloy was contaminated with metals of Fey origin. As they vanished, structural integrity of metals is gone."
