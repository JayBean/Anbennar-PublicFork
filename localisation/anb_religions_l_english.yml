Followers of this philosophy are uninterested by spirituality; instead focusing on creating and refining a “Theory of Everything” that explains exactly how reality works. Members are driven to observe and analyse the material world, in the hopes of being able to incorporate their discoveries to the doctrine in an act known as “Being touched by The Thought”. This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery. Those who follow The Thought are usually very tolerant to other ways of thinking, as they both hold the product of other people’s intelligence in high regard, and take advantage of the opportunity to research into other cultures."

It is said that a hall of a hundred storytellers couldn't tell the full Dwarven folklore even if they had a hundred years to do it. Their story was ancient by the time of Aul-Dwarov, and the rise and fall of that great empire only left behind more tragedies and tales of grandeur. Inspired by the heroes of old, many dwarves look towards the Dwarovar, All-Dwarves-Home, in order to reclaim the history and lands they have lost."

It was where the Dwarovkron was forged to unify all dwarfkind, and it was where the High Assembly of Holds met to advise its bearer. It was also where the surface terrace farms of the Serpent's Vale were managed, in which the High King could feed all his subjects food to sustain themselves in the dark depths of the mountain."
   HOLY_SITE_4311_DESC:0 "Grônstunad wasn’t the first hold founded after the Tree of Stone was breached, but no doubt one of the wealthiest. It grew quickly, overflowing with deposits of jade that were extracted and shipped west, creating a ‘jade rush’ composed of dwarves looking to find such a great deposit, or escape the dwarven wars of unification in the west. Eventually the west fell to the new orc menace and Grônstunad became the greatest Dwarven city in existence... for a time. By the time the surviving dwarves of the west regained the confidence to make contact with the east Grônstunad was no more, and was now the home of the hobgoblin race."
   HOLY_SITE_2931_DESC:0 "Er-Natvir was not only one of the core cities of the Dwarovar, but also the hub in which all rails sprouted from. All goods passing through to and from the capital passed through this hold, and the libraries, holding uncountable trade records, are a beautiful site to behold- a testament of Dwarven organization. Even in the final days of this city, goods were still recorded- mostly arms."
   HOLY_SITE_4078_DESC:0 "Named after Hehogrim the Diligent, Hehodovar was where many of the first holds were designed and architected. Based at the centre of the Dwarovar, it was allegedly the first capital of the dwarven peoples but by the time of unification it had become a place of the practical arts of crafting and building."
   HOLY_SITE_2963_DESC:0 "Jorkad Hall was a hold of no importance... until one day a dark scourge emerged from its depths. These beasts were named after the hold itself, but to the greater world, they were known by a simpler name: Orcs. Deadlier than the goblins that had infested the mountains, the orcish threat brought doom to upon dwarves. Since that day, dwarfkind lost their dominion over the mountains, and over the millennia more and more holds would perish under the orcish menace."
   HOLY_SITE_4093_DESC:0 "Arg-Ôrdstun was the capital of the Serpent's Reach, who in its day was oft unified against the High King of Aul-Dwarov. Meaning the Diamond Reach, it is said that the riches of the Dwarovar was controlled by the Ôrdstunic dwarves, and many diamonds to this day can trace its origin back to this powerful hold."
   HOLY_SITE_4269_DESC:0 "It was said that Halanna, the Earthmother, created the first dwarves in Earthseed, and it was with their help that the fine details of the world were perfected. When she died it was said that her heart was buried in her most favourite places, in order to watch over her finest creations from beyond - indeed, she did, and now the depths that Earthseed finds itself has now earned the namesake relating to Halanna: the Tree of Stone."

Ravelianists are part-scholar, part-preacher, and believe in unraveling the secrets of the world to discover and spread its fundamental Truths. A large number of these revelations come from their research in the God Fragment, a strange shard-like device that communicates in a near-undecipherable language that claims that it is the last portion of divinity, and that the precursor elves stole God's divinity and turned it into what we know today as magic. A popular tenet in the Ravelian faith is their wish to use artificery to bring this stolen magic to all."

While obscured by history, there had been some cases of peaceful coexistence in small pockets of the Deepwoods, such as Salla Ahain, and peaceful integration on a larger scale would be seen under the Overclan following its formation. However, the most prominent and mutually beneficial examples come from the Moon Elves of Cannor.\n\nThe historical record's first well-documented instance of these friendships came when a group of Ibevari adventurers, appalled by the Thorn Company's vicious treatment of newly-liberated goblin slaves offered their protection. Following peacekeeping service in the Ibevari reformation, the refugees were eventually resettled in Thanas. In later years, elven and goblin magnates would operate as a factional bloc in the Northern League's parliament, finding allies as minority groups marginalized by Gawedi hegemony.\n\nCulturally, this manifested as a tradition known as Silver Shamanism,wherein goblins would adopt elven magics and language, as well as material traditions such as architecture and styles of craft. The practice was considered endearing enough to warrant the aid of the more progressive segments of elven society's aid. Elves, either for pragmatic convenience or out of sincere admiration for their little imitators, offer consultancy and obscure techniques in industry and warfare in exchange for the numbers and technological innovation that goblins could provide in return, each party shoring up the other's relative weaknesses."

Thusly, inspired by the captivating storytelling and beautiful songs of the northern skalds, our religious leaders have adopted window-shaking worship sessions, wherein booming music, complex lyrics, and vibrantly costumed dance hold the tales of our gods and the traditions of our people fresh in our minds. Furthermore, our earnest embrace of these musics, along with the incorporation of the Skalds' songs into our worship has inspired some among their number to share the secrets of their bardic magics, which inspire our people and bolster our armies."

While the elves had developed a formalized system of rituals and appeasement to keep the fey from intefering in their affairs, the goblins simply designated an unfortunate few as Feykeepers.

Yet even in this state, gods are difficult to kill, and there are shamans that today sense their presence, even if only partly so: their half-digested consciousnesses stretched out in a void between sentience and oblivion, referred to as a collective mass, a maw of terror that whispers into its shamans' ears sweet and terrible nothings, asking only that their chosen may eat and eat for they no longer can."

Some envision it as a great and endless treasury, others an endless field of mushrooms and spoils, others yet deny it completely and see nothing but a gasping oblivion of gnashing teeth. But the believers of a certain cult not only accept its existence, but outright claim it is a pale underling to the true heaven of the goblins: the titular Kravi Oznad, a beyond greater than even heaven. \n\n This coveted greater heaven is whatever one desires, an endless amount of it in a plane of plenty that stretches further beyond what one can see, the only way one can achieve invitation to this heaven beyond heavens however is to die in a most goblinlike manner, and only that way. All goblin believers of this cult are to take arms, ride upon the battlefield and slay all those who oppose the goblin way of life, any means necessary. Whether it be dying of a misfire in the heat of battle, the explosion of an ill-timed missile, or simple slaying at the hands of a dwarf or otherwise after having killed tens of others, death is the only way to surpass the mediocre afterlife and achieve the heaven a goblin man or woman truly deserves!"

The beliefs of Möitsäliusko, meaning “spirits of the forest”, are varied, and they differ from tribe to tribe.

He considers himself heir of Agrados and Castellos alike and rightful master of both their peoples, the Alenics and the Escanni."

He is perhaps the most bitter of the Archdevils, firmly believing he has done nothing wrong, and has aligned himself with Kazraiel who he considers to also be unfairly condemned.\n\nAs the former god of communication, and earning his title as the Lord of Sloth, he is the Archdevil most capable of speaking directly to those on the Material Plane - whispering thoughts of apathy, sorrow or the pointlessness of their deeds to those he targets, sapping their wills."
    ildran:0 "Ildran"

He was the most enthusiastic of any of the Agradosian Host about their greatest creation, humanity, seeing himself reflected in their desire to dominate and reshape the world to suit themselves.\n\nHe preached a vision of a world forever seeking perfection, built by the ambitious hands of humanity and venerating a new pantheon of gods, attracting many of those unhappy with the conservatism of Castellos to the ranks of Agrados. For now, he satisfies himself by sending visions of glorious monuments to those who follow him, all while still dreaming of his promised new world inhabited only by his favored humans."

He was a minor god in the winning faction of Castellos, but later began a conspiracy to poison Castellos and other major gods, blame it on remaining loyalists to Agrados, and establish himself as well as co-conspirators Canturian and Forsara as the new Triune ruling the gods.\n\nThis would fail and he, and his co-conspirators, would be banished to the Lower Planes. The three would remain close allies, calling themselves the Triad and generally cooperating closely to make up for their weakness compared to the other four Archdevils."

    canturian_desc:0 "Canturian, the Baron of Envy, was formerly the god of music and theater and a loyalist to Castellos until he was cast to the Lower Realms for taking part in a conspiracy, led by Ibberal, to poison Castellos at a victory feast.\n\nHe would go on to be the most active member of the Triad formed with his co-conspirators, claiming to have made possible the creation of the first Cannorian vampires. While the truth of this statement can't really be determined, Canturian is known for granting his followers boons at the expense of those they are jealous of, and this would fit that pattern."
    forsara:0 "Forsara"
    forsara_desc:0 "Forsara, the Countess of Greed, was formerly the goddess of luck and charity and remained loyal to Castellos during the Godswar before being banished to the Lower Planes for her part in a conspiracy, alongside Ibberal and Canturian, to poison him and usurp his place as ruler of the gods.\n\nHer devils are perhaps responsible for the stereotype of the devil who makes outwardly fair, but secretly treacherous, deals."
