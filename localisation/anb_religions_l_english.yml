This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery.

Therefore, the Sculptors of Fate view the destruction of the remnants of the 332nd empire as a moral imperative, and believe that the 333rd empire will be self-evident: a lizardfolk state that holds the obelisks, and rules all lizardfolk is the 333rd empire - there is nothing more to it."

In more practical terms, they view the 332nd Empire not as a polity to be destroyed, but rather to be moulded into a vessel for fate in the form of the 333rd."

It is said that the Oono'i believe that the Dry Coast is what it is due to the works of their great ancestors. Since then however, the people have suffered greatly and many of them become Seedthrall servants of the jungle. Nowadays, only a few small tribes remain."

Kvangahga adherents believe that the goddess is the creator of the Gnolls, that when the world was young and wild she battled malevolent bestial spirits that were rampaging across Halann and reforged them, binding their reborn souls to the bodies of hyenas and making them creatures capable of virtue. Because of this belief, the Kvangahga view their Xhazobkult kin as wayward souls who have given in to their most base instincts, but who are capable of being "reforged" by Kvanga’s embrace.\n\nThe faith values efficiency, innovation and pragmatism and has a philosophy of "waste-not-want-not", taking things others would see as junk and putting them to good use. While most gnolls practice endocannibalism, the act has a special reverence for the followers of Kvanga, it is seen as a way of honouring the dead while not letting anything go to waste. The values of Kvangahga are well represented by the activities of mystical artisans known as Holy-Smiths or Rram Zelags in the east, and Carrion-Shepherds or Vog Mekza in the west. These holy men and women scavenge, trade and scrap items both natural and artificial to remake into magically-imbued tools for the faithful members of their pack to make use of.

They utilize magical runic tattoos to enhance their combat power and bond with the sabertooth tigers and massive wooly rhinoceroses they use as mounts.

Leaving the safety of the valley they came across many great felines - mountain lions, cheetahs and jaguars - and they sought to create a bond with these beasts.

One day there may be a cupbearer or herald or butler, the next the Seelie will question whatever you are referring to. There are a few exceptions to this, though. For instance, the Master of the Hunt is always the archfey known as the Lord of Beasts. Another is the Hatter of Grand Import or simply, the Grand Hatter.\n\nThe Grand Hatter is... well, we do not exactly know what it is. Or at least what the purpose of the position is other than it does not have much to do with hats and that it is curiously reserved for mortals. Fortunately, we do not need to know, it seems.

A grueling place, those who overcome the Gauntlet leave it more than they ever were.\n\nWhile the Unseelie fey must earn their passage, it is possible for us mortals to gain access given the right rituals and favors.

Short, silent, gray-skinned, these fey have the peculiar ability to detect when agreements they have witnessed are being breached. Something that the Unseelie take great advantage of.\n\nGive and take a few favors, a few such Oathkeepers could happen to be present the next time we meet with our vassals."

Villains such as Castan Beastbane have proven this. Millenia after his death, his name is enough to end satyr raves and cause pixies to hide amongst roses.\n\nFor these reasons came the Wild Horn. It is not so much a singular entity but a promise. A vow for those of  [Root.GetName] and the fey inhabitants to work together in common defense. The call is not something to be taken lightly as it is a stressful thing for many fey to fight. But, when called, they shall answer."

Pixies, for instance, have their flower clans. And satyrs have their rather infamous carousing grounds. Admittedly though, the fey tend to prefer simpler lives. Currency is a rarity if present. Agriculture and other crafts are done by hand as they have been done for thousands of years.\n\nThis works well enough for them, but it has become increasingly inefficient in this changing world we live in. Luckily, we have a chance to influence our neighbors to adopt more modern techniques. All we need to do is give a small push and call in some favors, and should see some gains in productivity.

A sweet scented note reads, "No strings attached, promise!"\n\nThe Unseelie have offered a gift of iron, bronze, and warstags, sure to be valuable for our military. "We expect nothing in return. This is simply in the spirit of giving.", claims a crisp and clean letter.\n\nOf course, despite their claims, the choice is not so straightforward. Neither side expects anything, yes, but both would be angered if we accepted the other's gift.

Pulling this task off has not been easy, and you have learned how to wear the mask of both a carefree ally of the Seelie Queen, and of a loyal servant of the Unseelie Court. One moment you will be laughing and reveling at a Seelie party, and the next you will be sparring with a stone-faced Unseelie fey.\n\nUnfortunately, somewhere you must have let that mask slip.\n\nBoth courts have invited you to the same grove just outside the capital, at the exact same time. Both have stubbornly refused to change the time or location of the meeting, or to explain what you will be doing at this grove. Neither has acknowledged the invitation of the other, but the unspoken message is clear: you must pick a side. Accepting one invitation and refusing another would be a clear signal of your loyalties, or on the other hand you could accept both and keep walking the tightrope."

Not the figurative kind. Literal red tape. Right now behind a tall, dark oak desk sits not the Governor of [fey_court_seelie_pranks_target.GetName], but a small roll of red tape. On the desk is a letter bearing the seal of the Seelie Court, which reads: \n\n"Sorry about our little mishap! We will immediately return the chickens to their owners, no paperwork required! After all, we wouldn’t want you to get bogged down in any… red tape!"\n\nWhen a mage entered the office to examine the scene, our fears were quickly confirmed.

These rumors have it that some within the Seelie Court itself are sponsoring something called "the Satyr-ing", a volatile storm of boozing, feasting and impromptu intimate relations.\n\nSimply put, it will be a party to remember, assuming anyone *can* remember it.

Those who enter into these "domains" uninvited are rare to return.\n\nThis would not be the biggest issue were it not for the fact that these domains and their boundaries tend to drift. And as it were, some number of villages in [fey_court_dryad_domain_province.GetName] are now "intruding" on a dryad domain.

In the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is a piece of blackened parchment, an ill tiding brought by our sour relations with the Unseelie.

Yet only after more than a few painful minutes do the various who’s who of [Root.GetName] finally arrive. It is all smiles as apologies are offered, but the slight does go unnoticed. The lax regard for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s time is deliberate. Even as the various figures banter and coo frivolously, a knowing tension mounts. On and on it builds until, finally, the subject of duties comes to head.\n\n"It is a difficult thing," one woman sighs.

Why else would a pod of zites be preparing one of their "Blood Bowls'', a strange sport more concerned with crushing the opposing team than actually scoring or winning the game, right outside the capital?\n\nAlready various Unseelie aligned fey are streaming to watch and even participate.

The same can be said when our relations with various fey communities are healthy.\n\nUnfortunately, with the Courts quiet at the moment and our currently tenuous relationship, the fey of [fey_court_unaligned_fairweather_fey_target.GetName] have decided to go about wholesale ignoring us or our wishes. Letting them go about their business will cause governance there to be more challenging, but will give them a chance to realize their lot will be better with us than without.

But, given a bit of prodding and goodwill, the apples are paid for, baths are had, and the clothing is (mostly) worn.\n\nUnfortunately, the goodwill part is lacking lately due to recent spats we’ve had with the local fey. In response, adherence to our "mucky laws" has plummeted accordingly. Fine produce has gone unaccounted. The musk of fey has made its residence in the capital and other towns. And just the other day a satyr’s immodesty cursed our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s eyes. Something must be done!"

However, the sound of soft footsteps in the night and muffled digging beneath their floorboards soon revealed the truth.\n\nDobies, small humanoid Fey who live inside the homes of others, whether they like it or not, have become widespread throughout [Root.GetName]. No one has actually seen one, mind you, but when farmers return home in the evening they often find a small amount of their food gone and a few silver coins on their table. While some initially set traps and hired guards, the dobies have skillfully avoided any attempt at capture. Most homeowners have been forced to accept their new tenants, and simply collect their coins whenever they return home from a day’s work."

Granted, the pixies have no construction knowledge and are too small to hold a hammer or materially contribute to the rebuilding effort in a big way, but their enthusiasm and kindness has greatly improved the morale and overall mood of the inhabitants."

They immerse themselves in common concepts like fun, humor, and joy, yes, but, what they consider funny, humorous, and joyful are not always the same as those considered under a mortal sense of propriety or reality. Yet those who join the revels of the Seelie find that leaving its raucous halls is a task far more difficult than joining, for to join the Court is to promise your heart to pursuing the light of life. That is a promise not broken easily or without consequence.\n\nNews has reached us that one of the courtiers of the Seelie’s eternal revels seeks this escape to find a life  - to return back to the mortal plane and find life outside of joy. Normally, such a choice would not be given to an attendant of the court, but, given our good graces with the Seelie, we could potentially convince them to let this reveler retire."

The details are sparse but it will certainly include bursting and dazzling lights, improvised music through brass and woodwind instruments, and cake with a frozen sweet cream inside.

Goods of all kinds, strange artifacts, and even stranger performances are coalesced into one eclectic carnival. And, as it were, the fey organizing the event are having a hard time determining the venue.\n\nIt needs to be large, spacious, and fungible. The first two are easy enough to find given the nature of the Feyrealm, but the last part has been more of a challenge… Apparently, the Seelie can’t determine what kind of fungus should be present. It goes without saying that trying to explain the misunderstanding of language occurring here wouldn’t get anybody anywhere. Instead, we could simply suggest a site, even if it isn’t what the fey actually want."

Then, without warning, the Zite kneels.\n\n"I offer myself and forgo the Unseelie, knowing you shall bring me greater foes than the King himself!"\n\nHe looks at you expectantly, his radiant rouge skin glowing with anticipation.

And now, some have begun to ponder whether [Root.Monarch.GetName] is in fact the Shadow of the King, an avatar of the Unseelie’s archfey ruler.\n\nOf course, the proposition is preposterous, but there is value in letting such whispers linger uncontested.

The mask he carved for himself is the white and red mask reminiscent of the very spirits that plagued the desert that the rulers of Tuiista Jaal have passed down to their heirs since his passing in Tuiinond in 32 A.A. when he ascended to godhood. When the mask is not being worn by a monarch it is returned to its resting place in the Jaal temple in Tuiinond. He is considered the most aggresive of the three and through his anger he motivated many Shuvüüsh to continue walking and fighting, even in the worst of circumstances. He is thus held responsible for instilling hope in the people when they needed it most and is the only person who ever killed a face stealing spirit. The warriors of the Saanorgegh faith often see him as their patron and leaders who worship him often try to emulate his strength, perserverance and agression."

In life she wore the mask of Tsarai only when she tried to gain his counsel, opting to keep her white featureless Izhuun Mask from her times as the family shaman at most times. When the mask is not being worn by a monarch it is returned to its resting place in the Faceless temple in Zougzengom.\n\nThe mask resembles that of a type of female spirit known for haunting dreams. She is considered the patron of all Saanorgegh women and through her message of unity and strength she is likely called out when a compromise is struck or before a cavalry charge is performed. If you hear "For the Faceless Queen" in a room, be at ease, for an agreement has been struck, but if you hear it in a field, run, for a charge is coming."

When his child, who had reformed Guwaamud passed to the afterlife, the deity came to the forefront again, now joined by his child at his side. Their conquests over religiously foreign lands and the strict teachings of father Bhengudakhnar make them the patron deity of those who wish to spread the faith through the bird, not the mouth.

Masters of oratory as they are, there was not a man or woman in the hall who could look away as they sang songs of the past, each Skald using the tales of the Gerudian heroes to justify their opinions on the matter of the day. \nThe Konungr had called this conclave of the Skalds to organize them, to put them all on the same page so that Gerudia may unite as one state and one faith against the Cannorians in the south. This grew more tiring by the minute, no matter how excellent the skills of the Skalds, their bickering seemed endless, as none could agree on which of the tales deserved the greatest honors or must be performed first, or other doctrinal disputes. \nJust as the Konungr’s patience ran thin, a young Skald stood and began to speak with a powerful and vibrant voice that echoed throughout the hall, words like thunder, and with scorn like ice.\n"Brothers and sisters, we should be ashamed of ourselves. The great king has called us here not to flail at each other like children, but to sit down as a community of faith and ensure Gerudia stands as one"\nThis bold declaration received boos and hisses from many of the Skalds in attendance, but also got the Konungr’s attention.\n"Fine, ignore me if you wish. Slander my name from Revrhavn to Urviksten, for I am Radulfr, and while some of you may be content to wake Elkaesal with your arguing, I intend to do what I was called here to do."\nRadulfr turned to the Konungr sitting upon the great throne in the hall.\n"My king, you summoned this conclave of the Skalds so that our people may never be without guidance again, so that the songs of Gerudia may never fall silent even when beset by our greatest of enemies, I humbly ask you to request a tale of me, so that I may now lead this council in bringing the faithful together.""

Students and followers of Radulfr, the man who became known as the Grand Reciter of Saga, the only one to hold that now infamous title. But Radulfr is now long dead, and the Faith has expanded far beyond what he would have ever dreamed, and these Skalds who carry his legacy now appeal to the Konungr to make a choice like their ancestor did when they commanded Radulfr to sing. \nAs our realm has spread far and wide, new tales are being added to the story of our people, and the Skalds of the realm have begun to sing of the present, not just the past. A sign of Gerudia’s growing power yes, but also a sign that the throne must step in once more to guide the Skalds. One of the reformers speaks up, presenting a scroll to the Konungr.\n"Great lord, I am Signy, and my fellow Skalds have chosen me to present our findings on the faith."\nThe Konungr takes the scroll and begins to read.\n"These four tales are the ones we believe the crown should sponsor so that the people may learn from them. Firstly, the rediscovery of the making of Ebonfrost, the great metal of our ancestors. Second, the settling of Ambrströnd all those years ago, and the legacy of the Gerudians who still live in Aelantir. Third, the tales of the reavers and adventurers who conquered Cannorian realms, as you and your dynasty have done. And lastly, the tale of Olav and Urvik, the origin of our people, and the origin of our strength."\nSigny stood and bowed while the Konungr read the composed songs.\n"All of them are valuable to us today, but simply say the word and we shall begin to sing one to the far reaches of Gerudia where your people shall listen.""

Lightening the tax sheriff's pouch, and in effect the coffers of the royal treasury.

But from a lone Einher, walking the desolate road by their lonesome, they could not help but alleviate of their possessions.

Many Gerudians tolerate these creatures, for if honored are often benevolent, but some prefer their abscence and opt to slay the creature. While Húsvattir are not particularly dangerous, they are experts at remaining unnoticed, and in their anger and spite they can cause grief for years to come. One such spirit has manifested its anger for far too long, and morphed into something far worse.

So too do they mimic the former occupants, terrorizing the surroundings. But compared to trolls, they are but small creatures. Ferocious but cowardly, small in stature but great in number. Even an average farmer can defeat one, but when the whole tribe attacks, villages are removed from the map. To cull such a threat, the Einher has gathered a host to battle such a threat. Striking at night, the goblin chieftain was cut down in the midst of battle.

From the bog-swallowed barrows of Haugrmyrr have truly ancient draugr emerged, claiming to serve the Frost Giants of old.

They have also refused any negotiation, and any attacks have been for naught. The only proper response is such: a one-on-one duel with their leader, to the death!

These hags prefer not to directly curse their victims: they instead simply intensify the cold weather and deliver invasive thoughts of despair. To them, nothing is sweeter than causing happy communities to turn against each other in desperation for survival, cackling from their frigid caves.

Worse still, some of these cults have taken to extreme practices, such as offering sacrifices to their patron. Enough!

Shorter growing periods, unpredictable, often cold weather, and poor soil all limit what can be grown to feed the population. So too is fishing limited by tumultous seas and frigid ice floes. In the dark months of winter, it is necessary for hunts to procure meat for sustenance.\n\nThis tradition has been modified greatly: the greatest of jarls, the most daring of warriors, and most inventive of Skalds all gather to track down the most fearsome of beasts! Unlike the southerners who prey after stags and boars, we Gerudians hunt real game: gargantuan mammoths, slithering lindwurms, and even living elementals of ice! The pursuit and kill of such prey cements your status as a powerful hunter, yet there is more to the hunt than just the kill. Hunting parties must be organized, allies and enemies assembled for the best vantage points - it is a political game in itself. One must also consider the patron of the hunt: many leaders chose to lead the hunt itself, yet some hand that honor and responsibility to their heir.\n\nWill you take it on yourself, blowing the horn of hunt?

While there is much deliberation over the minutiae, all agree that it states all lizardfolk must eventually be united under the 333rd Empire - Khatalashya. The Final Empire shall rule over all lizardfolk, hold all the pillars and bring about eternal prosperity. It is the duty of every follower of Anzalkatsa to work to fulfill this prophecy and be ready to sacrifice everything they may have for this goal, and this expectation is laid equally  across society. The peasantry, the merchants, the nobles and even the king must prostrate themselves to this end - it is their sole purpose.\n\nThe caretakers of this future are the naga, a rare mutation of lizardfolk set out by their appearance and great magical potential who form their own social class. They are found as advisors, scholars, priests, councilors - where there is power, and influence, so are they.\n\nDuty and competence are key virtues among Anzalkatsa, and the ordinary are expected to recognize their mediocrity and make way for rising stars. Those that cannot acknowledge their own limitations - or refuse to - are not long suffered by the nagas, who move to ensure they suffer a downfall of their own making. No right of birth grants immunity to this, and no king's throne can ever be truly stable against their machinations."

 zaradyrra_religion_desc:0 "The Zaradyrra faith originates from the first Ashhana lizardfolk relieved of the blood curse by music. Originally it was thought that only music could relieve the blood curse, but as Ashhana society began to develop it was discovered that many forms of art could weaken the hold of the blood curse, and that creating art was a far more powerful remedy than consuming it. The first Ashhana capable of curing their fellows became the bards, and some would go on to found the earliest Ashhana noble houses. As more and more wild Ashhana were brought into society, the Zaradyrra faith truly came to exist in its modern form as a collection of practices used to manage the blood curse on a day-to-day basis. The weakest means of combating the blood curse is to simply consume the art of others which is enough to maintain normal decorum and is the lot of many of the lower classes. The next most effective is to create derivative art, not truly original or groundbreaking but not just a copy either, and this is said to give the creator a truly clear mind which is more capable. These Echoes are the lot of the nobility and the occasional privileged lower-class craftsman. The most effective means is truly original artistic creation - the sole domain of bards."

Then, it explains how three of these people, including the Eotomolaque, revolted against and killed their respective gods, absorbing their powers and becoming legendary beasts, who to this day guard their descendants. They believe the Eotomolaque became the Epednar, their totem animal being the Thunderbird. The Eotepn in turn became the Rzentur, their totem animal being the Dragon, and the Eotyr became the Chiunife and Haraf’ne, their totem animal being the Poskawa Whale. Meanwhile, it is said the people who stayed under the yolk and continued to worship their god of water became the Ynnics, who therefore don’t have a totem animal.

At the center of the religion is their belief in Eslu, a harsh creator-god who designed the cycle of souls through the physical World Above and the spiritual World Below, and the Coyote, a treacherous trickster spirit elevated and granted thought to by Eslu, before destroying the fabric of reality by trying to escape its laws. Eslu is now trapped in the unholy Void Between, hunting down and absorbing the souls that fall into his realm, and it is said they will rise once again when they have recovered the strength of all souls stained by the Coyote.\n\nA major aspect of Great Tceusluhd comes from the myriad ways Eslu and the Coyote are seen by different tribes. In 1444, the most popular opinion is that Eslu was a necessarily oppressive god, demonizing the Coyote for tearing reality apart. These tribes take great honor in becoming part of Eslu in death and consider hunting and animal sacrifices sacred activities which strengthen Eslu. However, some Chiunife worship the Coyote and strange shaman-born coyote-elves called Decuvie, taking a position similar to the Epednar in saying that Eslu was a cruel god deserving to be cast down. These cults dabble frequently in necromancy in order to steal souls from Eslu and rise to prominence when their people are threatened by outside threats."

 skincarvers_religion_desc:0 "While the very existence of a ‘Silent Watcher’ culture is debated amongst scholars, some Silent Watcher behaviors could represent religious beliefs or superstitions. Namely, the marks of scarification that can be found on many Silent Watcher corpses. The Silent Watchers often use natural pigments to dye their scars in an arcane form of art. This body art, if looked at for too long, can grant confusing and strange visions and cause feelings of disassociation in the observer. Many theories exist about this tradition, with the most popular school of thought suggesting it is a mere feral instinct.  But detractors of this simplification of complex behavior cite the visions as proof that an explanation for the tradition could be much deeper. Other theories include: depictions of Precursor castes or societal roles, representations of their god or gods, a set of cultural markers representing ritual or societal achievements, or even recorded visions of future events. However, the exact nature of these behaviors will likely never be understood due to the impossibility of contact with the Silent Watchers."

The people here worshiped her and genie kind as the highest beings possible, foregoing their own gods.\n\nIn the modern day, few remain to practice the arts of the Genie Cult, due to the mass slaughtering of the Guryadagga by the Qeyikul. Despite nearing extinction, there remain small tribes across the continent who persist in their practices. Most center around Ardimya and worship of her due to the legacy of her kingdom. The Guryadagga do not believe her to be more supreme than other genies though; they hold the belief that Genies aren’t necessarily born equal, but they aren’t necessarily “above” another genie merely because of such.\n\nMuch of the practices found in the Genie Cult can be seen as progenitors to many of the practices of the Habab Zar and Rinta Seekers religions. What differentiates them is their direct belief in deities of higher power, and their use of idolatry and incense to invoke their power in prayer.\n\nMany of the Genie Cult’s practices are said to have originated from the Dim peoples, Ancient Bulwari, and smaller groups that would come to be the ancestors of the peoples living within the Jasiir Jadid and Jasiir Doog."

When they were created in the Great Imbalance, they fought off the evil of Oblivion and diced it into a thousand pieces. They then created a universe without Oblivion in it, and created a perfect world to inhabit themselves. Ultimately  they felt satisfied, and prepared to leave for the next plane. They each shed a tear; blood, flesh, mind, and soul. This gave birth to the first forms of life. Throughout the eons they’d evolve into species, including the elf.\n\nIt was with the elves where Oblivion returned. Their kings were not divine, and spewed corruption to the lands. This caused the Eye of Oblivion to set course for the world, to cause another Great Imbalance. Atop the most serene peak of the world, the Rigoti, a lone shepherd prayed for intervention from the Kings. The kings came through a rift in the sky and burst to the scene. All but one died shielding this plane from another Great Imbalance. The last True King remained with the elves, protecting the righteous of this world and letting the corruption turn to ash.\n\nThe Last True King thus gave a crown to the lone shepherd, as he became the Blessed King, and first of the Fasíri, marking his place with a white stone slab atop the peak. To be a true Fasíri king means receiving the same blessing as the lone shepherd, and taking the voyage to the top of Rigoti to receive the same spiritual blessing from the Last True King."

Common amongst all Rioqay Diú doctrines is the worship of the creator god Ñawsayachaer and the belief in the Fragmentation, a catastrophe at the millionth day of existence which divided all reality. The gods were fragmented into “visages”, taking up different aspects of the creation their parent god originally ruled over. Ñawsayachaer himself was torn apart into the God of the Sun, the Goddess of the Moon and the Emissary of the Beyond, creating an imbalance in the fundamental laws of the world."

Sayaer held up the night, and distanced himself from his past form of being, and discovering a new identity. Taking up a new form, she was quiet and merciful, bestowing great gifts for those who wake in the morning, and guarding those who happen to find themselves alone in the darkness. Together, they represent the sole constant within the world, the observable cycle of day and night: time. Musatqyachio, the Spirit Of The Beyond, remains distinct from all deities. Formed of the energy from Ñawsayachaer, Musatqyachio ventures into the abyss beyond the world, returning every so often as omens and blessings in the sky. It represents the remaining imbalance created by Ñawsayacheaer, and how, despite the efforts of Ñawach and Sayaer, the laws of the world still remain fundamentally broken. The last fragment is not accounted for. He is thus considered the reason for why Magic is fucked. Embodiment of Irreversible Change."
