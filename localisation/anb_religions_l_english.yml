This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery.

Therefore, the Sculptors of Fate view the destruction of the remnants of the 332nd empire as a moral imperative, and believe that the 333rd empire will be self-evident: a lizardfolk state that holds the obelisks, and rules all lizardfolk is the 333rd empire - there is nothing more to it."

Because of this belief, the Kvangahga view their Xhazobkult kin as wayward souls who have given in to their most base instincts, but who are capable of being "reforged" by Kvanga’s embrace.\n\nThe faith values efficiency, innovation and pragmatism and has a philosophy of "waste-not-want-not", taking things others would see as junk and putting them to good use. While most gnolls practice endocannibalism, the act has a special reverence for the followers of Kvanga, it is seen as a way of honouring the dead while not letting anything go to waste. The values of Kvangahga are well represented by the activities of mystical artisans known as Holy-Smiths or Rram Zelags in the east, and Carrion-Shepherds or Vog Mekza in the west.

The songs work in a similar fashion to fables, since their function is to lead to a particular moral or practical lesson about how to be a hunter, an ideal shared by most Harpy societies.\n\nHarpies see the act of hunting as the pursuit of one's objective, which could be something physical like mates or riches, or more philosophical, like knowledge.\n\nWhile the Hunt doesn’t have any form of clergy, each flock has a Songster, whose duty is to remember the songs, sing in festivities and pass down their knowledge to the next generation.

After their passing, these heroes rise to become gods - provided, of course, that the Emperor does not object. The feats that allow someone to ascend to godhood vary considerably, but the most common way is through war and conflict. When one dies and does not ascend, they are instead reincarnated.\n\nWhen Taychend became united, the imperial state took great pains to centralize the Taychendi belief system. Smaller regional cults were either integrated or suppressed, their gods becoming part of a new, standardized Taychendi pantheon. The imperial cult became widespread and state-sponsored, firmly integrating itself into Taychendi religious practice."

One day there may be a cupbearer or herald or butler, the next the Seelie will question whatever you are referring to. There are a few exceptions to this, though. For instance, the Master of the Hunt is always the archfey known as the Lord of Beasts. Another is the Hatter of Grand Import or simply, the Grand Hatter.\n\nThe Grand Hatter is... well, we do not exactly know what it is. Or at least what the purpose of the position is other than it does not have much to do with hats and that it is curiously reserved for mortals. Fortunately, we do not need to know, it seems. As long as we hold this "preciously prestigious position," we will enjoy a number of boons from the Seelie. At least until they tire of us."

A grueling place, those who overcome the Gauntlet leave it more than they ever were.\n\nWhile the Unseelie fey must earn their passage, it is possible for us mortals to gain access given the right rituals and favors. Doing so will enable us to better train our soldiers and leave them an image pleasing to the King himself."

The Unseelie have under their employ a group of fey with a similar purpose, the Ironbark Oathkeepers. Short, silent, gray-skinned, these fey have the peculiar ability to detect when agreements they have witnessed are being breached. Something that the Unseelie take great advantage of.\n\nGive and take a few favors, a few such Oathkeepers could happen to be present the next time we meet with our vassals."

Unique amongst these roles is the position of Dourach. Reserved only for mortals deemed worthy by the Court, Dourachs holds the understood authority of the Unseelie within the Material Plane.\n\nFor a time, we will be seen as arbiters of the Court’s will within our domain. A boon to the legitimacy of our rule. Of course, taking on such a role will leave us with high expectations from the Unseelie and their king."

Villains such as Castan Beastbane have proven this. Millenia after his death, his name is enough to end satyr raves and cause pixies to hide amongst roses.\n\nFor these reasons came the Wild Horn. It is not so much a singular entity but a promise. A vow for those of  [Root.GetName] and the fey inhabitants to work together in common defense. The call is not something to be taken lightly as it is a stressful thing for many fey to fight. But, when called, they shall answer."

   fey_court.11.d:0 "Despite what those outside the Deepwoods might think, our fey neighbors are not all irrational or chaotic creatures. Indeed, many have developed their own societies. Pixies, for instance, have their flower clans. And satyrs have their rather infamous carousing grounds. Admittedly though, the fey tend to prefer simpler lives. Currency is a rarity if present. Agriculture and other crafts are done by hand as they have been done for thousands of years.\n\nThis works well enough for them, but it has become increasingly inefficient in this changing world we live in. Luckily, we have a chance to influence our neighbors to adopt more modern techniques. All we need to do is give a small push and call in some favors, and should see some gains in productivity. At least while the fey are willing to listen."

From the kindly Lord Blossom to the mysterious Emerald Lady, these "courtless" archfey and their agendas only add to the chaotic game of intrigue that plays out in the Feyrealm.\n\nMost of the time, [Root.GetName] is largely free from the influence of these archfey. But sometimes, given the right time and place, we can attempt to invoke their aid as we would the Courts. Such rituals can be burdensome on our people and the fey around us, but the reward can be the subtle favor of one of the Courtless."

Before them are presented two gifts from the Seelie and Unseelie Courts. The Seelie have offered a gift of delicious sweets and candies, sure to lighten up any diplomatic meeting. A sweet scented note reads, "No strings attached, promise!"\n\nThe Unseelie have offered a gift of iron, bronze, and warstags, sure to be valuable for our military. "We expect nothing in return. This is simply in the spirit of giving.", claims a crisp and clean letter.\n\nOf course, despite their claims, the choice is not so straightforward. Neither side expects anything, yes, but both would be angered if we accepted the other's gift. We should think carefully about which court we would like to align ourselves with, or alternatively, refuse both of their gifts and stay neutral."

And yet, after years of cunning diplomacy, you are now a member of that exclusive club. Pulling this task off has not been easy, and you have learned how to wear the mask of both a carefree ally of the Seelie Queen, and of a loyal servant of the Unseelie Court. One moment you will be laughing and reveling at a Seelie party, and the next you will be sparring with a stone-faced Unseelie fey.\n\nUnfortunately, somewhere you must have let that mask slip.\n\nBoth courts have invited you to the same grove just outside the capital, at the exact same time. Both have stubbornly refused to change the time or location of the meeting, or to explain what you will be doing at this grove. Neither has acknowledged the invitation of the other, but the unspoken message is clear: you must pick a side. Accepting one invitation and refusing another would be a clear signal of your loyalties, or on the other hand you could accept both and keep walking the tightrope."

From this imposing structure the Governor manages the budget, signs decrees, and enforces the nation’s laws. Or at least, that’s what the Governor would normally be doing were it not for red tape. Not the figurative kind. Literal red tape. Right now behind a tall, dark oak desk sits not the Governor of [fey_court_seelie_pranks_target.GetName], but a small roll of red tape. On the desk is a letter bearing the seal of the Seelie Court, which reads: \n\n"Sorry about our little mishap! We will immediately return the chickens to their owners, no paperwork required! After all, we wouldn’t want you to get bogged down in any… red tape!"\n\nWhen a mage entered the office to examine the scene, our fears were quickly confirmed. They could immediately sense powerful transmutation magic radiating from the tape.

They immerse themselves in common concepts like fun, humor, and joy, yes, but, what they consider funny, humorous, and joyful are not always the same as those considered under a mortal sense of propriety or reality. Yet those who join the revels of the Seelie find that leaving its raucous halls is a task far more difficult than joining, for to join the Court is to promise your heart to pursuing the light of life. That is a promise not broken easily or without consequence.\n\nNews has reached us that one of the courtiers of the Seelie’s eternal revels seeks this escape to find a life  - to return back to the mortal plane and find life outside of joy. Normally, such a choice would not be given to an attendant of the court, but, given our good graces with the Seelie, we could potentially convince them to let this reveler retire."

 desc_trial_by_combat:0 "An ancient ritual in the Xianjie, where one can settle a dispute with another Righteous Master through a trial by combat. While not strictly to the death, many of these fights end up with dead Masters due to the mastery of dangerous martial prowess. While there’s less monks to pick from to form the bulk of our armies due to such dangerous practices, one can be ensured that the monks who survive, are the cream of the crop."

Mainly it is used during meditation hours, used to assist the Yan in spiritual enhancement and health. This process is so important that nations even assign hours of the day dedicated for such a practice, although time spent meditating is also time spent not working."

 desc_vow_of_poverty:0 "A vow that every Eunuch takes during their initial examinations, where failure to properly administer their assigned region after becoming a Eunuch means to swear off all their possessions and become a wandering hobo.

 desc_kobold_house_pets:0 "Golden Kobolds have been seen as a sign of good fortune since their introduction to Haless, which has prompted many families to keep them around as pets as charms for their wealth. Many scholars seem to believe that this tradition specifically occurred after the sighting of Balris throughout Yanshen and the subsequent groups of kobolds trying to follow its path. Balris was, for many Yan, considered to be Yanhe’s return, and so by acquiring a Golden kobold one could replicate the fortune of seeing Yanshen’s dragon of old. This tradition, however, has also come at a risk for independent Golden Kobolds, as if they aren’t careful they could be kidnapped at any point to be made a pet. These problems are not uncommon enough to dismiss, and the state must make sure their citizens aren’t being kidnapped in order to be novelty prizes."
 equal_inheritance:0 "Equal Inheritance"
 desc_equal_inheritance:0 "An ancient Kai law ever since the early days of the Phonan tribes, dictates that whenever the patriarch of the family dies, their land and wealth is split equally amongst their children. This law arose from the belief that if a child becomes greedy and cheats his siblings after the passing of their parent, the father will return as a vengeful spirit and curse the family line. By mandating this age-old tradition, rulers are able to lessen the cost of governing territory, with the caveat that they have less direct control of their territories."

To the Kai, they are the product of those who came before them and eventually will live amongst their ancestors as a spirit, so maintaining respect for those who came before is paramount. These celebrations are massive in scale, with funeral rites performed such as cleaning gravestones for the dead who have no family remaining and burning spirit paper to ensure the safety of one’s ancestors to the spirit realm. A big part of these festivals are the invitation of Shamans from across the Thidinkai region, who can help communicate with the dead in order for families to gain closure, helping to bind the Kai people together during this time of peace."

Whether you are a human following the violent legacy of your ancestors, elves lamenting for days past or even gnolls bound by demonic blood - in the Black Demense, magic is the great equalizer, and those who fail to wield it are bound by those who can. The shackles of the past will be broken, and all magic initiates will be made to treat each other as brothers, united by the mysteries of the Prime Discordance."

 desc_bonds_of_tolerance:0 "The Demesne believes in the will of magic, not the gods. Nevertheless, as the Ravelians said, fragments of the universal truth can be seen in the mythologies of the world.

One and both are the same.\n\nThe gods of the old world are false, for they are merely mages masquerading as something more. But do not lament, for hope is not lost. The Doctrine teaches us that power is magic, and magic, unlike divinity, knows no master and harbours no biases or grudges. It is by this truth that the Demesne liberates the world."

 desc_good_works_of_bureaucracy:0 "The terrifying power of the acolytes and their master is nothing without an army of officials and bureaucrats to keep the state running efficiently and with order.

 desc_cult_of_personality:0 "In the days of the Witch-Kings the Corinite faiths were twisted and divided, believing that their monarchs were the paragons of Corin regardless of whatever great injustice they did. It was truly brilliant. Though the universe itself is built on nothing but chaos, having no order or justice, the common people are not capable of handling that truth. Instead, we shall supply a story of godlike Acolytes whose very power proves their divine right to rule."

 desc_the_mages_peace:0 "Anbennar was so very close to achieving the same ambitions we seek today: the Mages' Peace. In the 13th century they united the warring kingdoms of Cannor under their banner.

Masters of oratory as they are, there was not a man or woman in the hall who could look away as they sang songs of the past, each Skald using the tales of the Gerudian heroes to justify their opinions on the matter of the day. \nThe Konungr had called this conclave of the Skalds to organize them, to put them all on the same page so that Gerudia may unite as one state and one faith against the Cannorians in the south. This grew more tiring by the minute, no matter how excellent the skills of the Skalds, their bickering seemed endless, as none could agree on which of the tales deserved the greatest honors or must be performed first, or other doctrinal disputes. \nJust as the Konungr’s patience ran thin, a young Skald stood and began to speak with a powerful and vibrant voice that echoed throughout the hall, words like thunder, and with scorn like ice.\n"Brothers and sisters, we should be ashamed of ourselves. The great king has called us here not to flail at each other like children, but to sit down as a community of faith and ensure Gerudia stands as one"\nThis bold declaration received boos and hisses from many of the Skalds in attendance, but also got the Konungr’s attention.\n"Fine, ignore me if you wish. Slander my name from Revrhavn to Urviksten, for I am Radulfr, and while some of you may be content to wake Elkaesal with your arguing, I intend to do what I was called here to do."\nRadulfr turned to the Konungr sitting upon the great throne in the hall.\n"My king, you summoned this conclave of the Skalds so that our people may never be without guidance again, so that the songs of Gerudia may never fall silent even when beset by our greatest of enemies, I humbly ask you to request a tale of me, so that I may now lead this council in bringing the faithful together.""

Students and followers of Radulfr, the man who became known as the Grand Reciter of Saga, the only one to hold that now infamous title. But Radulfr is now long dead, and the Faith has expanded far beyond what he would have ever dreamed, and these Skalds who carry his legacy now appeal to the Konungr to make a choice like their ancestor did when they commanded Radulfr to sing. \nAs our realm has spread far and wide, new tales are being added to the story of our people, and the Skalds of the realm have begun to sing of the present, not just the past. A sign of Gerudia’s growing power yes, but also a sign that the throne must step in once more to guide the Skalds. One of the reformers speaks up, presenting a scroll to the Konungr.\n"Great lord, I am Signy, and my fellow Skalds have chosen me to present our findings on the faith."\nThe Konungr takes the scroll and begins to read.\n"These four tales are the ones we believe the crown should sponsor so that the people may learn from them. Firstly, the rediscovery of the making of Ebonfrost, the great metal of our ancestors. Second, the settling of Ambrströnd all those years ago, and the legacy of the Gerudians who still live in Aelantir. Third, the tales of the reavers and adventurers who conquered Cannorian realms, as you and your dynasty have done. And lastly, the tale of Olav and Urvik, the origin of our people, and the origin of our strength."\nSigny stood and bowed while the Konungr read the composed songs.\n"All of them are valuable to us today, but simply say the word and we shall begin to sing one to the far reaches of Gerudia where your people shall listen.""

But today this hero stalks the bustling streets and narrow alleys. Petty thieves have created an alliance of sorts, stealing from the rich and poor alike. Lightening the tax sheriff's pouch, and in effect the coffers of the royal treasury. While it may not be an adventure of epic proportions, the Einher will trail these miscreants to whatever lair their bosses reside in. With the heads, quite literally, of this criminal organization cut off, order and prosperity will return to this town."

While they may be small and pathetic, like mice they have easily hidden in the dark corners of the countryside from our eagre tax sheriffs. But from a lone Einher, walking the desolate road by their lonesome, they could not help but alleviate of their possessions. And soon, the bandits found themselves relieved of their gold, limbs, and heads. Their hidden camps in the woods were found and burned.

Werewolves, wereboars, and werebears - these fearsome monsters fight not just with bestial savagery, but with the anger of hatred of the cursed. Matching their prowess, the Einher met the beast in the pasture under the full moon, howling like a mad beast as they slew the leader of the pack. The Skalds say the next full moon will be red."

Gerudians have stood against this threat as far back as our history remembers, and we have driven them back to the edges of the world, but yet they still emerge for more evil! Leading an elite regiment of warriors, the Einher assaulted the troll encampment and drained their foul blood into the rivers.

Many Gerudians tolerate these creatures, for if honored are often benevolent, but some prefer their abscence and opt to slay the creature. While Húsvattir are not particularly dangerous, they are experts at remaining unnoticed, and in their anger and spite they can cause grief for years to come. One such spirit has manifested its anger for far too long, and morphed into something far worse. The Einher will meet this threat by following the ancient traditions, offering appeasing tribute in the correct order to lure it out - before striking at the right moment, mercifully ending it's miserable existence."

So too do they mimic the former occupants, terrorizing the surroundings. But compared to trolls, they are but small creatures. Ferocious but cowardly, small in stature but great in number. Even an average farmer can defeat one, but when the whole tribe attacks, villages are removed from the map. To cull such a threat, the Einher has gathered a host to battle such a threat. Striking at night, the goblin chieftain was cut down in the midst of battle. Holding the chief's crown in hand, the rest of the goblins have laid down their arms and begun following the Einher as a leader!"

It is even said that the Wendigo are born from those who are forced to cannibalism out of desperation, twisted into unrecognizable monstrosities by the lingering magical corruption of the Day of Ashen Skies. Still, these monsters can be slain, and who better than Gerudians who do not balk and grotuesquery? And with the cadaver collectors eliminated, our new homesteads in this land can thrive!"

From the bog-swallowed barrows of Haugrmyrr have truly ancient draugr emerged, claiming to serve the Frost Giants of old. Wielding corroded iron, almost as decrepit and wasted as their rotted minds, their bodies snap and shatter with the blow of axes.

Constantly challenged by duels, an old orc commander is one that should be feared. This group of Orcs has been especially problematic, refusing to assimilate into our society and routinely raiding and killing. They have also refused any negotiation, and any attacks have been for naught. The only proper response is such: a one-on-one duel with their leader, to the death! Unfearing, our Einher will battle this fearsome foe, remembering the old adage: there is no such thing as an unfair battle."

Bundled up with shawls of fur, their pallid, frozen skin and chilling aura is all but unnoticeable against the raging Gerudian gales. These hags prefer not to directly curse their victims: they instead simply intensify the cold weather and deliver invasive thoughts of despair. To them, nothing is sweeter than causing happy communities to turn against each other in desperation for survival, cackling from their frigid caves. Bundled in furs blessed by the Skalds, the Einher sets forth through the many hamlets of the realm, searching for Bheurs to terminate."

Claiming to speak for long-forgotten deities, unseen forces, and even the yet-slumbering Elkaesal the White, cultist leaders have enthralled an entire town with their nonsensical rituals. Worse still, some of these cults have taken to extreme practices, such as offering sacrifices to their patron. Enough! Under cloaked disguise, our Einher will infiltrate the vile cult and offer themselves as the latest sacrifice. When the ceremony is to commence, they will cut the head off the serpent, ending their lies!"

Shorter growing periods, unpredictable, often cold weather, and poor soil all limit what can be grown to feed the population. So too is fishing limited by tumultous seas and frigid ice floes. In the dark months of winter, it is necessary for hunts to procure meat for sustenance.\n\nThis tradition has been modified greatly: the greatest of jarls, the most daring of warriors, and most inventive of Skalds all gather to track down the most fearsome of beasts! Unlike the southerners who prey after stags and boars, we Gerudians hunt real game: gargantuan mammoths, slithering lindwurms, and even living elementals of ice! The pursuit and kill of such prey cements your status as a powerful hunter, yet there is more to the hunt than just the kill. Hunting parties must be organized, allies and enemies assembled for the best vantage points - it is a political game in itself. One must also consider the patron of the hunt: many leaders chose to lead the hunt itself, yet some hand that honor and responsibility to their heir.\n\nWill you take it on yourself, blowing the horn of hunt? Or should your next-in-line learn their responsibilities this day?"

Our tales have begun to be told in their circles alongside the stories of their gods, with the One-Armed Skald told alongside stories of Castellos and Corin. It is clear that with time, they will begin to understand that their gods are stories of the past, not chronicles of divine beings.

While there is much deliberation over the minutiae, all agree that it states all lizardfolk must eventually be united under the 333rd Empire - Khatalashya. The Final Empire shall rule over all lizardfolk, hold all the pillars and bring about eternal prosperity. It is the duty of every follower of Anzalkatsa to work to fulfill this prophecy and be ready to sacrifice everything they may have for this goal, and this expectation is laid equally  across society. The peasantry, the merchants, the nobles and even the king must prostrate themselves to this end - it is their sole purpose.\n\nThe caretakers of this future are the naga, a rare mutation of lizardfolk set out by their appearance and great magical potential who form their own social class. They are found as advisors, scholars, priests, councilors - where there is power, and influence, so are they.\n\nDuty and competence are key virtues among Anzalkatsa, and the ordinary are expected to recognize their mediocrity and make way for rising stars. Those that cannot acknowledge their own limitations - or refuse to - are not long suffered by the nagas, who move to ensure they suffer a downfall of their own making. No right of birth grants immunity to this, and no king's throne can ever be truly stable against their machinations."

Originally it was thought that only music could relieve the blood curse, but as Ashhana society began to develop it was discovered that many forms of art could weaken the hold of the blood curse, and that creating art was a far more powerful remedy than consuming it. The first Ashhana capable of curing their fellows became the bards, and some would go on to found the earliest Ashhana noble houses. As more and more wild Ashhana were brought into society, the Zaradyrra faith truly came to exist in its modern form as a collection of practices used to manage the blood curse on a day-to-day basis. The weakest means of combating the blood curse is to simply consume the art of others which is enough to maintain normal decorum and is the lot of many of the lower classes. The next most effective is to create derivative art, not truly original or groundbreaking but not just a copy either, and this is said to give the creator a truly clear mind which is more capable. These Echoes are the lot of the nobility and the occasional privileged lower-class craftsman. The most effective means is truly original artistic creation - the sole domain of bards."

Iishkeli, Goddess of Air, is praised for providing bounteous space for the Haraf'ne of old to rule Yaih'ilhil from their Six Flying Mountains, until eventually, the envious Di'iikunail, God of Fire, who could only create through destruction, brought low the Flying Mountains and razed all the worlds from the immense force of their downfall.\n\nIt is from this destruction that Di'iikunail forged a singular world to replace all others: Keiin'ilhil, a scorching, searing land of death. However, the Good Gods of Water and Air saw fit to create and give life to Ek'elas, God of Land, to serve as the guardian of the Haraf'ne in this new world.

Other important beliefs include their unique Afterlife, in which the deads’ spirits integrate the manifestation of water the most in line with the person in life, and a shared cosmogony.\n\nIn Kooras myths, the All-World was created by the four great gods : Kseldos, god of the Water World, Dikaal, god of the Fire World, Etkal, god of the Stone World and Chkalii, goddess of the Air World. These Worlds were Good Worlds, and as such only Good could be found in them. The myths then talk about Dikaal’s treachery, where Dikaal forcibly created the Silent Watchers and corrupted his world into the Dark World. The other gods killed Dikaal in retribution, only for the Dark World to twist their hearts and a battle to break out between them. Finally, it is said that Kseldos, upon slaying his fellow gods in battle, saw the Dark World engulfing the All-World and in great sorrow decided to create the manifestations of water so the Water World could remain as a source of Good even after his inevitable death."

At the center of the religion is their belief in Eslu, a harsh creator-god who designed the cycle of souls through the physical World Above and the spiritual World Below, and the Coyote, a treacherous trickster spirit elevated and granted thought to by Eslu, before destroying the fabric of reality by trying to escape its laws. Eslu is now trapped in the unholy Void Between, hunting down and absorbing the souls that fall into his realm, and it is said they will rise once again when they have recovered the strength of all souls stained by the Coyote.\n\nA major aspect of Great Tceusluhd comes from the myriad ways Eslu and the Coyote are seen by different tribes. In 1444, the most popular opinion is that Eslu was a necessarily oppressive god, demonizing the Coyote for tearing reality apart. These tribes take great honor in becoming part of Eslu in death and consider hunting and animal sacrifices sacred activities which strengthen Eslu. However, some Chiunife worship the Coyote and strange shaman-born coyote-elves called Decuvie, taking a position similar to the Epednar in saying that Eslu was a cruel god deserving to be cast down. These cults dabble frequently in necromancy in order to steal souls from Eslu and rise to prominence when their people are threatened by outside threats."

Namely, the marks of scarification that can be found on many Silent Watcher corpses. The Silent Watchers often use natural pigments to dye their scars in an arcane form of art. This body art, if looked at for too long, can grant confusing and strange visions and cause feelings of disassociation in the observer. Many theories exist about this tradition, with the most popular school of thought suggesting it is a mere feral instinct.  But detractors of this simplification of complex behavior cite the visions as proof that an explanation for the tradition could be much deeper. Other theories include: depictions of Precursor castes or societal roles, representations of their god or gods, a set of cultural markers representing ritual or societal achievements, or even recorded visions of future events. However, the exact nature of these behaviors will likely never be understood due to the impossibility of contact with the Silent Watchers."

The Guryadagga do not believe her to be more supreme than other genies though; they hold the belief that Genies aren’t necessarily born equal, but they aren’t necessarily “above” another genie merely because of such.\n\nMuch of the practices found in the Genie Cult can be seen as progenitors to many of the practices of the Habab Zar and Rinta Seekers religions. What differentiates them is their direct belief in deities of higher power, and their use of idolatry and incense to invoke their power in prayer.\n\nMany of the Genie Cult’s practices are said to have originated from the Dim peoples, Ancient Bulwari, and smaller groups that would come to be the ancestors of the peoples living within the Jasiir Jadid and Jasiir Doog."

When they were created in the Great Imbalance, they fought off the evil of Oblivion and diced it into a thousand pieces. They then created a universe without Oblivion in it, and created a perfect world to inhabit themselves. Ultimately  they felt satisfied, and prepared to leave for the next plane. They each shed a tear; blood, flesh, mind, and soul. This gave birth to the first forms of life. Throughout the eons they’d evolve into species, including the elf.\n\nIt was with the elves where Oblivion returned. Their kings were not divine, and spewed corruption to the lands. This caused the Eye of Oblivion to set course for the world, to cause another Great Imbalance. Atop the most serene peak of the world, the Rigoti, a lone shepherd prayed for intervention from the Kings. The kings came through a rift in the sky and burst to the scene. All but one died shielding this plane from another Great Imbalance. The last True King remained with the elves, protecting the righteous of this world and letting the corruption turn to ash.\n\nThe Last True King thus gave a crown to the lone shepherd, as he became the Blessed King, and first of the Fasíri, marking his place with a white stone slab atop the peak. To be a true Fasíri king means receiving the same blessing as the lone shepherd, and taking the voyage to the top of Rigoti to receive the same spiritual blessing from the Last True King."

Yet, she descends once more, returning to the nest to nourish and grow the abilities of her children so they may yet join her.” For the Hobgoblins of the Nomsyulhan Plateau the world itself is in a never ending battle between Order and Chaos. A battle which was heavily spun to Chaos’ favour on the Day of Ashen Skies. A battle they cannot afford to lose again. Order is therefore the defining centerpiece to their faith and percolates into all aspects of life. Hobgoblins under this faith are duty-bound to reach enlightenment such that they may join in this cosmic battle, and crucially, are tasked to return from their flight and elevate those who can not yet fly."

 un_khudai_religion_desc:0 "Un Khudai can be roughly translated into the common tongue as “One Harmony.” At its core is a set of culturally entrenched ecological traditions focused on maintaining the cycle of the world through the framing of the fivefold compass. Earth reveals metal, which begets water, which feeds the forests, which in turn fuels the fire, which seeds the earth once more. The former is but a facet of the grander fivefold compass, which, in its totality, defines the movements, creation, and destruction of those elements. Un Khudai stresses that this cycle must be maintained, for should the Khudi grow beyond their means and break the Harmony of the Land, the spirits will bury their civilization, and return them to epochs long past."
 
 #Kinbond

 kinbond_religion_desc:0 "The Kinbond is the name of the telepathic link shared by the Cursed Ones, and as such is central to their spiritual beliefs.\n\nThe Cursed Ones believe that the Great Creator shaped the world and populated it with the First People, only to realize that they were flawed, and thus decided to cleanse the world in a great frost. While most of the spirits agreed with the Great Creator, one of them, known as the East Spirit, rebelled against him, and selected those most worthy of the First People to be given part of his soul in the form of the Kinbond, so they would understand each other and not fight amongst themselves. The East Spirit then sacrificed himself to the Sun to stop the frost from consuming the world, his ashes falling on the land that would become the Forest of the Cursed Ones.\n\nThe chosen of the East Spirit would go on to form the Kins, each Kin having a shared soul going back to their progenitors from the time of the frost. The members of a Kin venerate their ancestors by reciting their tales and emulating them in their own lives, resulting in each Kin having its own epic retelling their history over the centuries."
