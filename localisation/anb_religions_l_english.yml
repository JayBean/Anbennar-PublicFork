A large number of these revelations come from their research in the God Fragment, a strange shard-like device that communicates in a near-undecipherable language that claims that it is the last portion of divinity, and that the precursor elves stole God's divinity and turned it into what we know today as magic. A popular tenet in the Ravelian faith is their wish to use artificery to bring this stolen magic to all."

 giantkin_cult_desc:0 "While goblins are a more than ravenous enough folk for the liking of many, the giantkin in the dry basins of the great plains and their, somehow, even dumber kin that occupy the far north, hold appetites that are beyond reason and comprehension. Their gods are all but gone, left in scraps and pieces spread apart through all their kind, their essences shattered to pieces and sitting in the gullets of every ogre and troll. Yet even in this state, gods are difficult to kill, and there are shamans that today sense their presence, even if only partly so: their half-digested consciousnesses stretched out in a void between sentience and oblivion, referred to as a collective mass, a maw of terror that whispers into its shamans' ears sweet and terrible nothings, asking only that their chosen may eat and eat for they no longer can."

But the believers of a certain cult not only accept its existence but outright claim it is a pale underling to the true heaven of the goblins: the titular Kravi Oznad, a beyond greater than even heaven.\n\nThis coveted greater heaven is whatever one desires, an endless amount of it in a plane of plenty that stretches further beyond what one can see, the only way one can achieve invitation to this heaven beyond heavens however is to die in a most goblinlike manner, and only that way. All goblin believers of this cult are to take arms, ride upon the battlefield and slay all those who oppose the goblin way of life, by any means necessary. Whether it be dying of a misfire in the heat of battle, the explosion of an ill-timed missile, or simple slaying at the hands of a dwarf or otherwise after having killed tens of others, death is the only way to surpass the mediocre afterlife and achieve the heaven a goblin man or woman truly deserves!"

Followers of this philosophy are uninterested by spirituality; instead focusing on creating and refining a “Theory of Everything” that explains exactly how reality works. Members are driven to observe and analyse the material world, in the hopes of being able to incorporate their discoveries to the doctrine in an act known as “Being touched by The Thought”. This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery. Those who follow The Thought are usually very tolerant to other ways of thinking, as they both hold the product of other people’s intelligence in high regard, and take advantage of the opportunity to research into other cultures."

The philosophy focuses upon the role of the republican city-state as the most civilized form of governance, and the city-state as the basis of all civilization. Kheionism does not innately recognize any belief in a higher power, for it is a uniquely atheist doctrine, lacking in any kind of spirituality. Instead, Kheionists place their faith in their elected leaders to defend them and lead them into the future."

 kvangahga:0 "Kvangahga"
 kvangahga_religion_desc:0 "Kvangahga “The Way of Kvanga” in Gnollish, is an ancient religion that venerates Kvanga, a primordial earth goddess of rebirth, recycling and reforging. Kvangahga adherents believe that the goddess is the creator of the Gnolls, that when the world was young and wild she battled demonic creatures that were rampaging across Halann and reforged them, binding their reborn souls to the bodies of hyenas and making them creatures capable of virtue. Because of this belief, the Kvangahga view their Xhazobkult kin as wayward souls who have given in to their most base instincts, but who are capable of being “reforged” by Kvanga’s embrace.\n\nThe faith values efficiency, innovation and pragmatism and has a philosophy of “waste-not-want-not”, taking things others would see as junk and putting them to good use. While most gnolls practice endocannibalism, the act has a special reverence for the followers of Kvanga, it is seen as a way of honouring the dead while not letting anything go to waste. The Kvangahga’s values are well represented by the activities of the Holy-Smiths or Rram Zelags in Gnollish, mystical artisans and blacksmiths who scavenge, trade and scrap items that they can reforge into magically-imbued tools for the faithful members of their pack to make use of."

An animistic faith with elements of ancestor worship, the Hunt’s teachings are passed down to the new generations via songs, whose themes traditionally include the histories of ancient matriarchs and the actions or characteristics of certain birds, among other subjects. The songs work in a similar fashion to fables, since their function is to lead to a particular moral or practical lesson about how to be a hunter, an ideal shared by most Harpy societies.\n\nHarpies see the act of hunting as the pursuit of one's objective, which could be something physical like mates or riches, or more philosophical, like knowledge.\n\nWhile the Hunt doesn’t have any form of clergy, each flock has a Songster, whose duty is to remember the songs, sing in festivities and pass down their knowledge to the next generation.

The feats that allow someone to ascend to godhood vary considerably, but the most common way is through war and conflict. When one dies and does not ascend, they are instead reincarnated.\n\nWhen Taychend became united, the imperial state took great pains to centralize the Taychendi belief system. Smaller regional cults were either integrated or suppressed, their gods becoming part of a new, standardized Taychendi pantheon. The imperial cult became widespread and state-sponsored, firmly integrating itself into Taychendi religious practice."

In life she wore the mask of Tsarai only when she tried to gain his counsel, opting to keep her white featureless Izhuun Mask from her times as the family shaman at most times. When the mask is not being worn by a monarch it is returned to its resting place in the Faceless temple in Zougzengom.\n\nThe mask resembles that of a type of female spirit known for haunting dreams. She is considered the patron of all Saanorgegh women and through her message of unity and strength she is likely called out when a compromise is struck or before a cavalry charge is performed. If you hear "For the Faceless Queen" in a room, be at ease, for an agreement has been struck, but if you hear it in a field, run, for a charge is coming."

When his child, who had reformed Guwaamud passed to the afterlife, the deity came to the forefront again, now joined by his child at his side. Their conquests over religiously foreign lands and the strict teachings of father Bhengudakhnar make them the patron deity of those who wish to spread the faith through the bird, not the mouth.

Many scholars seem to believe that this tradition specifically occurred after the sighting of Balris throughout Yanshen and the subsequent groups of kobolds trying to follow its path. Balris was, for many Yan, considered to be Yanhe’s return, and so by acquiring a Golden kobold one could replicate the fortune of seeing Yanshen’s dragon of old. This tradition, however, has also come at a risk for independent Golden Kobolds, as if they aren’t careful they could be kidnapped at any point to be made a pet. These problems are not uncommon enough to dismiss, and the state must make sure their citizens aren’t being kidnapped in order to be novelty prizes."

This law arose from the belief that if a child becomes greedy and cheats his siblings after the passing of their parent, the father will return as a vengeful spirit and curse the family line. By mandating this age-old tradition, rulers are able to lessen the cost of governing territory, with the caveat that they have less direct control of their territories."

To the Kai, they are the product of those who came before them and eventually will live amongst their ancestors as a spirit, so maintaining respect for those who came before is paramount. These celebrations are massive in scale, with funeral rites performed such as cleaning gravestones for the dead who have no family remaining and burning spirit paper to ensure the safety of one’s ancestors to the spirit realm. A big part of these festivals are the invitation of Shamans from across the Thidinkai region, who can help communicate with the dead in order for families to gain closure, helping to bind the Kai people together during this time of peace."

Masters of oratory as they are, there was not a man or woman in the hall who could look away as they sang songs of the past, each Skald using the tales of the Gerudian heroes to justify their opinions on the matter of the day. \nThe Konungr had called this conclave of the Skalds to organize them, to put them all on the same page so that Gerudia may unite as one state and one faith against the Cannorians in the south. This grew more tiring by the minute, no matter how excellent the skills of the Skalds, their bickering seemed endless, as none could agree on which of the tales deserved the greatest honors or must be performed first, or other doctrinal disputes. \nJust as the Konungr’s patience ran thin, a young Skald stood and began to speak with a powerful and vibrant voice that echoed throughout the hall, words like thunder, and with scorn like ice.\n“Brothers and sisters, we should be ashamed of ourselves. The great king has called us here not to flail at each other like children, but to sit down as a community of faith and ensure Gerudia stands as one”\nThis bold declaration received boos and hisses from many of the Skalds in attendance, but also got the Konungr’s attention.\n“Fine, ignore me if you wish. Slander my name from Revrhavn to Urviksten, for I am Radulfr, and while some of you may be content to wake Elkaesal with your arguing, I intend to do what I was called here to do.”\nRadulfr turned to the Konungr sitting upon the great throne in the hall.\n“My king, you summoned this conclave of the Skalds so that our people may never be without guidance again, so that the songs of Gerudia may never fall silent even when beset by our greatest of enemies, I humbly ask you to request a tale of me, so that I may now lead this council in bringing the faithful together.”"

Students and followers of Radulfr, the man who became known as the Grand Reciter of Saga, the only one to hold that now infamous title. But Radulfr is now long dead, and the Faith has expanded far beyond what he would have ever dreamed, and these Skalds who carry his legacy now appeal to the Konungr to make a choice like their ancestor did when they commanded Radulfr to sing. \nAs our realm has spread far and wide, new tales are being added to the story of our people, and the Skalds of the realm have begun to sing of the present, not just the past. A sign of Gerudia’s growing power yes, but also a sign that the throne must step in once more to guide the Skalds. One of the reformers speaks up, presenting a scroll to the Konungr.\n“Great lord, I am Signy, and my fellow Skalds have chosen me to present our findings on the faith.”\nThe Konungr takes the scroll and begins to read.\n“These four tales are the ones we believe the crown should sponsor so that the people may learn from them. Firstly, the rediscovery of the making of Ebonfrost, the great metal of our ancestors. Second, the settling of Ambrströnd all those years ago, and the legacy of the Gerudians who still live in Aelantir. Third, the tales of the reavers and adventurers who conquered Cannorian realms, as you and your dynasty have done. And lastly, the tale of Olav and Urvik, the origin of our people, and the origin of our strength.”\nSigny stood and bowed while the Konungr read the composed songs.\n“All of them are valuable to us today, but simply say the word and we shall begin to sing one to the far reaches of Gerudia where your people shall listen.”"

But today this hero stalks the bustling streets and narrow alleys. Petty thieves have created an alliance of sorts, stealing from the rich and poor alike. Lightening the tax sheriff's pouch, and in effect the coffers of the royal treasury. While it may not be an adventure of epic proportions, the Einher will trail these miscreants to whatever lair their bosses reside in. With the heads, quite literally, of this criminal organization cut off, order and prosperity will return to this town."

While they may be small and pathetic, like mice they have easily hidden in the dark corners of the countryside from our eagre tax sheriffs. But from a lone Einher, walking the desolate road by their lonesome, they could not help but alleviate of their possessions. And soon, the bandits found themselves relieved of their gold, limbs, and heads. Their hidden camps in the woods were found and burned.

Werewolves, wereboars, and werebears - these fearsome monsters fight not just with bestial savagery, but with the anger of hatred of the cursed. Matching their prowess, the Einher met the beast in the pasture under the full moon, howling like a mad beast as they slew the leader of the pack. The Skalds say the next full moon will be red."

Gerudians have stood against this threat as far back as our history remembers, and we have driven them back to the edges of the world, but yet they still emerge for more evil! Leading an elite regiment of warriors, the Einher assaulted the troll encampment and drained their foul blood into the rivers.

Many Gerudians tolerate these creatures, for if honored are often benevolent, but some prefer their abscence and opt to slay the creature. While Húsvattir are not particularly dangerous, they are experts at remaining unnoticed, and in their anger and spite they can cause grief for years to come. One such spirit has manifested its anger for far too long, and morphed into something far worse. The Einher will meet this threat by following the ancient traditions, offering appeasing tribute in the correct order to lure it out - before striking at the right moment, mercifully ending it's miserable existence."

So too do they mimic the former occupants, terrorizing the surroundings. But compared to trolls, they are but small creatures. Ferocious but cowardly, small in stature but great in number. Even an average farmer can defeat one, but when the whole tribe attacks, villages are removed from the map. To cull such a threat, the Einher has gathered a host to battle such a threat. Striking at night, the goblin chieftain was cut down in the midst of battle. Holding the chief's crown in hand, the rest of the goblins have laid down their arms and begun following the Einher as a leader!"

It is even said that the Wendigo are born from those who are forced to cannibalism out of desperation, twisted into unrecognizable monstrosities by the lingering magical corruption of the Day of Ashen Skies. Still, these monsters can be slain, and who better than Gerudians who do not balk and grotuesquery? And with the cadaver collectors eliminated, our new homesteads in this land can thrive!"

From the bog-swallowed barrows of Haugrmyrr have truly ancient draugr emerged, claiming to serve the Frost Giants of old. Wielding corroded iron, almost as decrepit and wasted as their rotted minds, their bodies snap and shatter with the blow of axes.

Constantly challenged by duels, an old orc commander is one that should be feared. This group of Orcs has been especially problematic, refusing to assimilate into our society and routinely raiding and killing. They have also refused any negotiation, and any attacks have been for naught. The only proper response is such: a one-on-one duel with their leader, to the death! Unfearing, our Einher will battle this fearsome foe, remembering the old adage: there is no such thing as an unfair battle."

Bundled up with shawls of fur, their pallid, frozen skin and chilling aura is all but unnoticeable against the raging Gerudian gales. These hags prefer not to directly curse their victims: they instead simply intensify the cold weather and deliver invasive thoughts of despair. To them, nothing is sweeter than causing happy communities to turn against each other in desperation for survival, cackling from their frigid caves. Bundled in furs blessed by the Skalds, the Einher sets forth through the many hamlets of the realm, searching for Bheurs to terminate."

Claiming to speak for long-forgotten deities, unseen forces, and even the yet-slumbering Elkaesal the White, cultist leaders have enthralled an entire town with their nonsensical rituals. Worse still, some of these cults have taken to extreme practices, such as offering sacrifices to their patron. Enough! Under cloaked disguise, our Einher will infiltrate the vile cult and offer themselves as the latest sacrifice.

Shorter growing periods, unpredictable, often cold weather, and poor soil all limit what can be grown to feed the population. So too is fishing limited by tumultous seas and frigid ice floes. In the dark months of winter, it is necessary for hunts to procure meat for sustenance.\n\nThis tradition has been modified greatly: the greatest of jarls, the most daring of warriors, and most inventive of Skalds all gather to track down the most fearsome of beasts! Unlike the southerners who prey after stags and boars, we Gerudians hunt real game: gargantuan mammoths, slithering lindwurms, and even living elementals of ice! The pursuit and kill of such prey cements your status as a powerful hunter, yet there is more to the hunt than just the kill. Hunting parties must be organized, allies and enemies assembled for the best vantage points - it is a political game in itself. One must also consider the patron of the hunt: many leaders chose to lead the hunt itself, yet some hand that honor and responsibility to their heir.\n\nWill you take it on yourself, blowing the horn of hunt? Or should your next-in-line learn their responsibilities this day?"

Iishkeli, Goddess of Air, is praised for providing bounteous space for the Haraf'ne of old to rule Yaih'ilhil from their Six Flying Mountains, until eventually, the envious Di'iikunail, God of Fire, who could only create through destruction, brought low the Flying Mountains and razed all the worlds from the immense force of their downfall.\n\nIt is from this destruction that Di'iikunail forged a singular world to replace all others: Keiin'ilhil, a scorching, searing land of death.

  jaakaiin_religion_desc:0 "Ja’akaiin, meaning the Water Song in the Kooras tongue is the faith of the Kooras Ruinborn Elves. While some beliefs of the Kooras differ from one tribe to another, the main tenets of Ja’akaiin consist of animistic notions, belief in the Water World and the Dark World—opposed Worlds that compose the universe and in which either only Good or Evil can be found—and worship of water and Damestear. Other important beliefs include their unique Afterlife, in which the deads’ spirits integrate the manifestation of water the most in line with the person in life, and a shared cosmogony.\n\nIn Kooras myths, the All-World was created by the four great gods : Kseldos, god of the Water World, Dikaal, god of the Fire World, Etkal, god of the Stone World and Chkalii, goddess of the Air World. These Worlds were Good Worlds, and as such only Good could be found in them. The myths then talk about Dikaal’s treachery, where Dikaal forcibly created the Silent Watchers and corrupted his world into the Dark World. The other gods killed Dikaal in retribution, only for the Dark World to twist their hearts and a battle to break out between them. Finally, it is said that Kseldos, upon slaying his fellow gods in battle, saw the Dark World engulfing the All-World and in great sorrow decided to create the manifestations of water so the Water World could remain as a source of Good even after his inevitable death."

Their creation myth talks about how these people, the Eotomolaque, were created alongside three other elven races by four cruel and oppressive gods. Then, it explains how three of these people, including the Eotomolaque, revolted against and killed their respective gods, absorbing their powers and becoming legendary beasts, who to this day guard their descendants. They believe the Eotomolaque became the Epednar, their totem animal being the Thunderbird. The Eotepn in turn became the Rzentur, their totem animal being the Dragon, and the Eotyr became the Chiunife and Haraf’ne, their totem animal being the Poskawa Whale. Meanwhile, it is said the people who stayed under the yolk and continued to worship their god of water became the Ynnics, who therefore don’t have a totem animal. A common Epednar practice is what they call the Thunder Dance, which consists of multiple physical and mental trials, as they sacrifice themselves for the community, in imitation of the Eotomolaque of old."

 #Skincarvers
 skincarvers:0 "Skincarvers"
 skincarvers_religion_desc:0 "While the very existence of a ‘Silent Watcher’ culture is debated amongst scholars, some Silent Watcher behaviors could represent religious beliefs or superstitions. Namely, the marks of scarification that can be found on many Silent Watcher corpses. The Silent Watchers often use natural pigments to dye their scars in an arcane form of art. This body art, if looked at for too long, can grant confusing and strange visions and cause feelings of disassociation in the observer. Many theories exist about this tradition, with the most popular school of thought suggesting it is a mere feral instinct.  But detractors of this simplification of complex behavior cite the visions as proof that an explanation for the tradition could be much deeper. Other theories include: depictions of Precursor castes or societal roles, representations of their god or gods, a set of cultural markers representing ritual or societal achievements, or even recorded visions of future events. However, the exact nature of these behaviors will likely never be understood due to the impossibility of contact with the Silent Watchers."

When they were created in the Great Imbalance, they fought off the evil of Oblivion and diced it into a thousand pieces. They then created a universe without Oblivion in it, and created a perfect world to inhabit themselves. Ultimately  they felt satisfied, and prepared to leave for the next plane. They each shed a tear; blood, flesh, mind, and soul. This gave birth to the first forms of life. Throughout the eons they’d evolve into species, including the elf.\n\nIt was with the elves where Oblivion returned. Their kings were not divine, and spewed corruption to the lands. This caused the Eye of Oblivion to set course for the world, to cause another Great Imbalance. Atop the most serene peak of the world, the Rigoti, a lone shepherd prayed for intervention from the Kings. The kings came through a rift in the sky and burst to the scene. All but one died shielding this plane from another Great Imbalance. The last True King remained with the elves, protecting the righteous of this world and letting the corruption turn to ash.\n\nThe Last True King thus gave atom the mountain of Rigoti a crown to the lone shepherd, as he became the Blessed King, and first of the Eltibhar, marking his place with a white stone slab atop the peak. To be a true Eltibhar king means receiving the same blessing as the lone shepherd, and taking the voyage to the top of Rigoti to receive the same spiritual blessing from the Last True King."
