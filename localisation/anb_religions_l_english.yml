It is said that a hall of a hundred storytellers couldn't tell the full Dwarven folklore even if they had a hundred years to do it. Their story was ancient by the time of Aul-Dwarov, and the rise and fall of that great empire only left behind more tragedies and tales of grandeur. Inspired by the heroes of old, many dwarves look towards the Dwarovar, All-Dwarves-Home, in order to reclaim the history and lands they have lost."

It was where the Dwarovkron was forged to unify all dwarfkind, and it was where the High Assembly of Holds met to advise its bearer. It was also where the surface terrace farms of the Serpent's Vale were managed, in which the High King could feed all his subjects food to sustain themselves in the dark depths of the mountain."
   HOLY_SITE_4311_DESC:0 "Grônstunad wasn’t the first hold founded after the Tree of Stone was breached, but no doubt one of the wealthiest. It grew quickly, overflowing with deposits of jade that were extracted and shipped west, creating a ‘jade rush’ composed of dwarves looking to find such a great deposit, or escape the dwarven wars of unification in the west. Eventually the west fell to the new orc menace and Grônstunad became the greatest Dwarven city in existence... for a time. By the time the surviving dwarves of the west regained the confidence to make contact with the east Grônstunad was no more, and was now the home of the hobgoblin race."
   HOLY_SITE_2931_DESC:0 "Er-Natvir was not only one of the core cities of the Dwarovar, but also the hub in which all rails sprouted from. All goods passing through to and from the capital passed through this hold, and the libraries, holding uncountable trade records, are a beautiful site to behold- a testament of Dwarven organization. Even in the final days of this city, goods were still recorded- mostly arms."
   HOLY_SITE_4078_DESC:0 "Named after Hehogrim the Diligent, Hehodovar was where many of the first holds were designed and architected. Based at the centre of the Dwarovar, it was allegedly the first capital of the dwarven peoples but by the time of unification it had become a place of the practical arts of crafting and building."
   HOLY_SITE_2963_DESC:0 "Jorkad Hall was a hold of no importance... until one day a dark scourge emerged from its depths. These beasts were named after the hold itself, but to the greater world, they were known by a simpler name: Orcs. Deadlier than the goblins that had infested the mountains, the orcish threat brought doom to upon dwarves. Since that day, dwarfkind lost their dominion over the mountains, and over the millennia more and more holds would perish under the orcish menace."
   HOLY_SITE_4093_DESC:0 "Arg-Ôrdstun was the capital of the Serpentreach, who in its day was oft unified against the High King of Aul-Dwarov.

   HOLY_SITE_4269_DESC:0 "It was said that Halanna, the Earthmother, created the first dwarves in Earthseed, and it was with their help that the fine details of the world were perfected. When she died it was said that her heart was buried in her most favourite places, in order to watch over her finest creations from beyond - indeed, she did, and now the depths that Earthseed finds itself has now earned the namesake relating to Halanna: the Tree of Stone."

Ravelianists are part-scholar, part-preacher, and believe in unraveling the secrets of the world to discover and spread its fundamental Truths. A large number of these revelations come from their research in the God Fragment, a strange shard-like device that communicates in a near-undecipherable language that claims that it is the last portion of divinity, and that the precursor elves stole God's divinity and turned it into what we know today as magic. A popular tenet in the Ravelian faith is their wish to use artificery to bring this stolen magic to all."

Furthermore, our earnest embrace of these musics, along with the incorporation of the Skalds' songs into our worship has inspired some among their number to share the secrets of their bardic magics, which inspire our people and bolster our armies."

While the elves had developed a formalized system of rituals and appeasement to keep the fey from interfering in their affairs, the goblins simply designated an unfortunate few as Feykeepers. Made to live in (comparatively) ramshackle huts outside the borders of their villages, these balefully unfortunate individuals would be made to bear the brunt of the fey's curses, and be dispatched to be on the wrong end of every tricky deal."

Their gods are all but gone, left in scraps and pieces spread apart through all their kind, their essences shattered to pieces and sitting in the gullets of every ogre and troll. Yet even in this state, gods are difficult to kill, and there are shamans that today sense their presence, even if only partly so: their half-digested consciousnesses stretched out in a void between sentience and oblivion, referred to as a collective mass, a maw of terror that whispers into its shamans' ears sweet and terrible nothings, asking only that their chosen may eat and eat for they no longer can."

But the believers of a certain cult not only accept its existence, but outright claim it is a pale underling to the true heaven of the goblins: the titular Kravi Oznad, a beyond greater than even heaven.\n\nThis coveted greater heaven is whatever one desires, an endless amount of it in a plane of plenty that stretches further beyond what one can see, the only way one can achieve invitation to this heaven beyond heavens however is to die in a most goblinlike manner, and only that way. All goblin believers of this cult are to take arms, ride upon the battlefield and slay all those who oppose the goblin way of life, any means necessary. Whether it be dying of a misfire in the heat of battle, the explosion of an ill-timed missile, or simple slaying at the hands of a dwarf or otherwise after having killed tens of others, death is the only way to surpass the mediocre afterlife and achieve the heaven a goblin man or woman truly deserves!"

Members are driven to observe and analyse the material world, in the hopes of being able to incorporate their discoveries to the doctrine in an act known as “Being touched by The Thought”. This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery. Those who follow The Thought are usually very tolerant to other ways of thinking, as they both hold the product of other people’s intelligence in high regard, and take advantage of the opportunity to research into other cultures."

Perhaps to survive we must maintain this sense of mystery and esoteric nature to safeguard our way of life."
 trial_by_combat:0 "Trial by Combat"
 desc_trial_by_combat:0 "An ancient ritual in the Xianjie, where one can settle a dispute with another Righteous Master through a trial by combat. While not strictly to the death, many of these fights end up with dead Masters due to the mastery of dangerous martial prowess. While there’s less monks to pick from to form the bulk of our armies due to such dangerous practices, one can be ensured that the monks who survive, are the cream of the crop."

 desc_temple_communities:0 "Communal life is a core part of the Xianjie, and many of its residents spend their entire lives either in or next to a temple.

 desc_matchlock_monks:0 "The new age of gunpowder warfare may be seen as an affront to traditions by some, but others have been able to the spiritual aspects of it: the ceremony of reloading, the smell of smoke akin to smelling incense, the focus of aiming and the release of the weight upon firing. Perhaps we should follow suit, and this is the path forward through history?"
 teachings_of_balris:0 "Teachings of Balris"
 desc_teachings_of_balris:0 "Balris taught the Goldscales many things, from an appreciation of the fine arts to philosophical lessons. Since His disappearance, countless of statues, temples and shrines have been built in His honour, and their maintenance is paid for by the many kobolds donating some of their shed gold scales, which are then used to pay for repairs."
 meditation_and_tea:0 "Meditation and Tea"
 desc_meditation_and_tea:0 "It is said that in Yanshen, tea is as ubiquitous in houses as water is, and while the saying is dubious in truth, it is undeniable tea is an essential part of Yanshen's culture. Mainly it is used during meditation hours, used to assist the Yan in spiritual enhancement and health. This process is so important that nations even assign hours of the day dedicated for such a practice, although time spent meditating is also time spent not working."
 vow_of_poverty:0 "Vow of Poverty"
 desc_vow_of_poverty:0 "A vow that every Eunuch takes during their initial examinations, where failure to properly administer their assigned region after becoming a Eunuch means to swear off all their possessions and become a wandering hobo. Fear of losing possessions caused eunuchs to be less corrupt, but also can cause stagnation in the nation due to said fear."
 kobold_house_pets:0 "Kobold House Pets"
 desc_kobold_house_pets:0 "Golden Kobolds have been seen as a sign of good fortune since their introduction to Haless, which has prompted many families to keep them around as pets as charms for their wealth. Many scholars seem to believe that this tradition specifically occurred after the sighting of Balris throughout Yanshen and the subsequent groups of kobolds trying to follow its path. Balris was, for many Yan, considered to be Yanhe’s return, and so by acquiring a Golden kobold one could replicate the fortune of seeing Yanshen’s dragon of old. This tradition, however, has also come at a risk for independent Golden Kobolds, as if they aren’t careful they could be kidnapped at any point to be made a pet. These problems are not uncommon enough to dismiss, and the state must make sure their citizens aren’t being kidnapped in order to be novelty prizes."
 equal_inheritance:0 "Equal Inheritance"
 desc_equal_inheritance:0 "An ancient Kai law ever since the early days of the Phonan tribes, dictates that whenever the patriarch of the family dies, their land and wealth is split equally amongst their children. This law arose from the belief that if a child becomes greedy and cheats his siblings after the passing of their parent, the father will return as a vengeful spirit and curse the family line. By mandating this age-old tradition, rulers are able to lessen the cost of governing territory, with the caveat that they have less direct control of their territories."
 remembrance_festivals:0 "Remembrance Festivals"
 desc_remembrance_festivals:0 "Thidinkai is known for its large celebrations for remembering their ancestors who live on in spirit form. To the Kai, they are the product of those who came before them and eventually will live amongst their ancestors as a spirit, so maintaining respect for those who came before is paramount. These celebrations are massive in scale, with funeral rites performed such as cleaning gravestones for the dead who have no family remaining and burning spirit paper to ensure the safety of one’s ancestors to the spirit realm. A big part of these festivals are the invitation of Shamans from across the Thidinkai region, who can help communicate with the dead in order for families to gain closure, helping to bind the Kai people together during this time of peace."
 guardians_after_death:0 "Guardians After Death"
 desc_guardians_after_death:0 "An ancient Bim Lau native ritual that had soldiers who died in battle return as phantom garrison troops, it has since then spread throughout Bomdan and is seen from Khabtei Teleni’s walls to Lot Dekkhang’s stadium thanks to ancient Bim Lau’s presence in the lands. By creating larger forts to fit these specters inside, one need not use humans for defense as long as they have spirits for protection." 
 spirit_influenced_crafts:0 "Spirit-Influenced Crafts"
 desc_spirit_influenced_crafts:0 "While many parts of Haless enjoy creating works of art about the supernatural, the Bom are considered by many to be the pioneers of spirit-related works of art. From wonderful paintings showcasing the ethereal beauty of the water nymphs along the Hukai and Telebei, to sculptures that can perfectly render any spectral beast, there is no shortage of the spiritual influence present in Bom art, which can take months to years to perfect."
 honsai_the_ghostemperor:0 "The Ghost-Emperor"
 desc_honsai_the_ghostemperor:0 "There are many rituals to pay respect and homage to the spirits that guide a life. Ensuring they are carried out on behalf of the Ghost-Emperor will bind him closer to our nation, and our nation closer to him.\n\n§GAs long as the we use the Aspect, the Ghostemperor will loose 33% less Willpower each year§!"
   
 black_doctrine:0 "Black Doctrine"
 black_doctrine_religion_desc:0 "The Black Doctrine rejects the legitimacy of all gods, casting them as evil demiurges who created this world to keep us ignorant and oppressed. They are opposed by the Black Demesne's Sorcerer-King and Acolytes, who have reshaped the fundamental chaos of the world into a new order that all can participate in."
 one_people_under_magic:0 "One People Under Magic"
 desc_one_people_under_magic:0 "All are equal under magical law. Whether you are a human following the violent legacy of your ancestors, elves lamenting for days past or even gnolls bound by demonic blood - in the Black Demense, magic is the great equalizer, and those who fail to wield it are bound by those who can. The shackles of the past will be broken, and all magic initiates will be made to treat each other as brothers, united by the mysteries of the Prime Discordance."
 bonds_of_tolerance:0 "Bonds of Tolerance"
 desc_bonds_of_tolerance:0 "The Demesne believes in the will of magic, not the gods. Nevertheless, as the Ravelians said, fragments of the universal truth can be seen in the mythologies of the world. So too do we believe that the lies of the demiurges can be made useful. Let the lesser creatures believe what they may, for as long as they serve the Skull Throne, they are serving to build a world of truth."
 no_gods_only_mages:0 "No Gods, Only Mages"
 desc_no_gods_only_mages:0 "What is a god but a being of incredible power? What is an acolyte but a being of incredible power? One and both are the same.\n\nThe gods of the old world are false, for they are merely mages masquerading as something more. But do not lament, for hope is not lost. The Doctrine teaches us that power is magic, and magic, unlike divinity, knows no master and harbours no biases or grudges. It is by this truth that the Demesne liberates the world."
 good_works_of_bureaucracy:0 "Good Works of Bureaucracy"
 desc_good_works_of_bureaucracy:0 "The terrifying power of the acolytes and their master is nothing without an army of officials and bureaucrats to keep the state running efficiently and with order. Their work must not be forgotten, no, it must be venerated as the greatest calling our mundane subjects can aspire to, given that they are without magical ability."
 morning_prostrations:0 "Midnight Prostrations"
 desc_morning_prostrations:0 "Every midnight each citizen of the realm must lie on the floor, face down and prostrate themselves in the direction of Castonath - for we must never forget that our allegiance always lies with the One whom nature itself obeys."
 cult_of_personality:0 "Cult of Personality"
 desc_cult_of_personality:0 "In the days of the Witch-Kings the Corinite faiths were twisted and divided, believing that their monarchs were the paragons of Corin regardless of whatever great injustice they did. It was truly brilliant. Though the universe itself is built on nothing but chaos, having no order or justice, the common people are not capable of handling that truth. Instead, we shall supply a story of godlike Acolytes whose very power proves their divine right to rule."
 the_mages_peace:0 "The Mages' Peace"
 desc_the_mages_peace:0 "Anbennar was so very close to achieving the same ambitions we seek today: the Mages' Peace. In the 13th century they united the warring kingdoms of Cannor under their banner. They did this not through peace or unity, but through an overwhelming threat: that any petty rulers who continued to shed meaningless blood would simply be obliterated through the cleansing power of magic."

 desc_schools_of_history:0 "The cloud of the past hangs over this world, twisting those it infects into arrogance and rebellion.

 expand_the_dark_world:0 "Expand the Dark World"
 desc_expand_the_dark_world:0 "Much of Haless is fearful of the Lefthand Path, viewing us with distrust and hatred. If we are to keep from being destroyed by close minded cravens, the ways of the Lefthand Path must dominate the land."
 gunpowder_meditation:0 "Gunpowder Meditation"
 desc_gunpowder_meditation:0 "When mixed with a variety of illegal substances, snorting gunpowder can allow warriors to enter a 'powder trance', enchancing both mind and body. Some have even entered a sort of meditative trance after comsuming gunpowder, rendering themselves unable to feel pain. Sadly, not feeling pain is not the same as not being able to die."
 demon_warriors:0 "Demon Warriors"
 desc_demon_warriors:0 "The Oni of the Demon Hills are a reclusive lot, and are often feared for their consumption of humans as ritual sacrifice and tribute from nearby human villages. Some humans, however, have been sent to the hills to train under the Oni as powerful warriors bearing masks akin to their masters."

 desc_barter_with_dark_spirits:0 "Haless is full of supernatural spirits, some good, and some most definitely bad. Our cousins in the Righteous Path see these dark spirits as something to avoid and banish, but perhaps accepting, listening and appeasing rather than fearing them may grant us greater power."
 wisdom_beyond_honor:0 "Wisdom beyond Honor"
 desc_wisdom_beyond_honor:0 ""Honour is for mountains. Unmovable, venerable, yet still. Wisdom is like wind. Moving, youthful, and free. A mind must be like wind, if they are to reach true enlightenment." -Monra Kajume"
 advocation_of_chi_stealers:0 "Advocation of Chi-Stealers"
 desc_advocation_of_chi_stealers:0 "Using and manipulating another living thing's lifeforce (chi) has always been taboo in the Righteous Path. But why is it so? Surely the strongest must become stronger, if not for the benefit of one's self, but for the country as a whole?"
 mummy_monks:0 "Mummy Monks"
 desc_mummy_monks:0 "The way to enlightenment is a long one, and often requires years upon years of meditation and contemplation. For most, death is the great inhibitor to enlightenment, but what if it was not? By invoking dark rituals and strange methods of embalming we may be able to preserve our monk's minds in meditation even when the body begins to fail."
 way_of_the_shadows:0 "Way of the Shadows"
 desc_way_of_the_shadows:0 "The threat of The Command looms across Haless and as countless villages are conquered many of the peasantry have begun to act against their hobgoblin overlords of their own accord rather than waiting for nominal powers to come to their rescue. The acceptance of 'shadow warriors', or 'ninja', against hobgoblins and even tyrannous Halessi lords in our land may be of benefit to our survival."
 organize_the_cults:0 "Organize the Cults"
 desc_organize_the_cults:0 "There are many shadowy cults and sects of the Lefthand Path. Some are hidden away in the tenets of village folk belief, some are mystery organizations in the darkest cities and others are simply wayward adherants following their own path away from the norms. If we are to solidify ourselves as a nation state we must bring these cults to our control."
 witches_and_shamans:0 "Witches and Shamans"
 desc_witches_and_shamans:0 "Those that wield magic using other sources beyond one's own natural energy (chi) are usually seen as outcasts away from mainstream society, or at best, oddities best left alone. By opening ourselves to learn from these pagan priests, wielders of what the sun elves called 'arcane magic' and hedge witches lurking in the most remote of villages, we may open ourselves to a new road on the Lefthand Path."
