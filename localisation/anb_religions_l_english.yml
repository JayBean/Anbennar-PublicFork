Members are driven to observe and analyse the material world, in the hopes of being able to incorporate their discoveries to the doctrine in an act known as “Being touched by The Thought”. This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery. Those who follow The Thought are usually very tolerant to other ways of thinking, as they both hold the product of other people’s intelligence in high regard, and take advantage of the opportunity to research into other cultures."

Their story was ancient by the time of Aul-Dwarov, and the rise and fall of that great empire only left behind more tragedies and tales of grandeur. Inspired by the heroes of old, many dwarves look towards the Dwarovar, All-Dwarves-Home, in order to reclaim the history and lands they have lost."

It was where the Dwarovkron was forged to unify all dwarfkind, and it was where the High Assembly of Holds met to advise its bearer. It was also where the surface terrace farms of the Serpent's Vale were managed, in which the High King could feed all his subjects food to sustain themselves in the dark depths of the mountain."
   HOLY_SITE_4311_DESC:0 "Grônstunad wasn’t the first hold founded after the Tree of Stone was breached, but no doubt one of the wealthiest. It grew quickly, overflowing with deposits of jade that were extracted and shipped west, creating a ‘jade rush’ composed of dwarves looking to find such a great deposit, or escape the dwarven wars of unification in the west. Eventually the west fell to the new orc menace and Grônstunad became the greatest Dwarven city in existence... for a time. By the time the surviving dwarves of the west regained the confidence to make contact with the east Grônstunad was no more, and was now the home of the hobgoblin race."
   HOLY_SITE_2931_DESC:0 "Er-Natvir was not only one of the core cities of the Dwarovar, but also the hub in which all rails sprouted from. All goods passing through to and from the capital passed through this hold, and the libraries, holding uncountable trade records, are a beautiful site to behold- a testament of Dwarven organization. Even in the final days of this city, goods were still recorded- mostly arms."
   HOLY_SITE_4078_DESC:0 "Named after Hehogrim the Diligent, Hehodovar was where many of the first holds were designed and architected. Based at the centre of the Dwarovar, it was allegedly the first capital of the dwarven peoples but by the time of unification it had become a place of the practical arts of crafting and building."
   HOLY_SITE_2963_DESC:0 "Jorkad Hall was a hold of no importance... until one day a dark scourge emerged from its depths. These beasts were named after the hold itself, but to the greater world, they were known by a simpler name: Orcs. Deadlier than the goblins that had infested the mountains, the orcish threat brought doom to upon dwarves. Since that day, dwarfkind lost their dominion over the mountains, and over the millennia more and more holds would perish under the orcish menace."
   HOLY_SITE_4093_DESC:0 "Arg-Ôrdstun was the capital of the Serpent's Reach, who in its day was oft unified against the High King of Aul-Dwarov.

When she died it was said that her heart was buried in her most favourite places, in order to watch over her finest creations from beyond - indeed, she did, and now the depths that Earthseed finds itself has now earned the namesake relating to Halanna: the Tree of Stone."

Ravelianists are part-scholar, part-preacher, and believe in unraveling the secrets of the world to discover and spread its fundamental Truths. A large number of these revelations come from their research in the God Fragment, a strange shard-like device that communicates in a near-undecipherable language that claims that it is the last portion of divinity, and that the precursor elves stole God's divinity and turned it into what we know today as magic. A popular tenet in the Ravelian faith is their wish to use artificery to bring this stolen magic to all."

This spirit in the past has taken on the form of a gentle swan, whose influences can still be felt in nations that have turned away from the Mystic Accord."

Some old Bom artifacts indicate that the Telebei before the rise of High Philosophy took on the form of a dolphin and quickly charged up and down the river, which its followers attempt to emulate with its aggressive military tactics. Those who worship the Telebei prefer sieging and fast charges instead of their enemies who hide behind their tall walls, in an attempt to finally destroy the temples of the High Gods."

To protect themselves from malevolent spirits most wear intricately carved masks, sometimes carved by themselves but often passed down through families. Their shamans, who wear black featureless masks guide the people by communicating with gods and spirits. The idea that anyone worthy enough of ascension can join the three brothers upon death makes their birdriders fight with fervor and loot with impunity."

When the mask is not being worn by a monarch it is returned to its resting place in the Tsarai temple in Zougzengom. He is considered the calmest of the three and through his logical reasoning is held responsible for preventing schisms from arising during the Husuusing. Followers of him usually pride themselves with calmth and understanding and leaders who worship him tend to attempt to rule with the same incredible finesse that he showed in his life and beyond."

The mask he carved for himself is the lavender gray mask depicting a catlike beast that the rulers of Rüng Oedek have passed down to their heirs since his passing in Kaashegaarch 27 A.A. when he ascended to godhood. When the mask is not being worn by a monarch it is returned to its resting place in the Oedek temple in Kaashegaarch. He is considered the most spiritual of the three and through his intrinsic understanding of the face-eating spirits he was able to devise the plan of crafting masks. He is thus held responsible for preventing the death of all Shuvüüsh during the Husuusing. The shamans of the Saanorgegh faith usually see him as their patron and leaders who worship him often force their faith upon the unbelievers."

When the mask is not being worn by a monarch it is returned to its resting place in the Jaal temple in Tuiinond. He is considered the most aggresive of the three and through his anger he motivated many Shuvüüsh to continue walking and fighting, even in the worst of circumstances. He is thus held responsible for instilling hope in the people when they needed it most and is the only person who ever killed a face-eating spirit. The warriors of the Saanorgegh faith often see him as their patron and leaders who worship him often try to emulate his strength, perserverance and agression."

Before her ascension to godhood she was a legendary Kusheng who united the Shuvüüsh people under one banner for the first time in over 400 years. In life she wore the mask of Tsarai but upon her passing a new mask was crafted during a weeklong grand ritual in which shamans from all across the Saanorgegh world gathered to attempt to commune with her spirit beyond the grave. When the mask is not being worn by a monarch it is returned to its resting place in the Faceless temple in Zougzengom.\n\nThe mask resembles that of a type of female spirit known for haunting dreams. She is considered the patron of all Saanorgegh women and through her message of unity and strength she is likely called out when a compromise is struck or before a cavalry charge is performed. If you hear "For the Faceless Queen" in a room, be at ease, for an agreement has been struck, but if you hear it in a field, run, for a charge is coming."

Firstly the great Bhengudak, he who first subjugated the Odheongu and formed the Kaashegate of Guwaamud. That realm stood over 800 years under his watchful gaze from the skies, but eventually fell due to infighting. In response he planted his seed to grow it once more and centuries later his seed bore fruit and a child was born with the destiny to do it again. When his child, who had reformed Guwaamud passed to the afterlife, the deity came to the forefront again, now joined by his child at his side. Their conquests over religiously foreign lands and the strict teachings of father Bhengudakhnar make them the patron deity of those who wish to spread the faith through the bird, not the mouth. As such rulers who don the mask carved according to the descriptions given by the deity themselves during communion will often attempt to bring the Saanorgegh faith to others through conquest."

 expand_the_dark_world:0 "Expand the Dark World"
 desc_expand_the_dark_world:0 "Much of Haless is fearful of the Lefthand Path, viewing us with distrust and hatred. If we are to keep from being destroyed by close minded cravens, the ways of the Lefthand Path must dominate the land."
 gunpowder_meditation:0 "Gunpowder Meditation"
 desc_gunpowder_meditation:0 "When mixed with a variety of illegal substances, snorting gunpowder can allow warriors to enter a 'powder trance', enchancing both mind and body. Some have even entered a sort of meditative trance after comsuming gunpowder, rendering themselves unable to feel pain. Sadly, not feeling pain is not the same as not being able to die."
 demon_warriors:0 "Demon Warriors"
 desc_demon_warriors:0 "The Oni of the Demon Hills are a reclusive lot, and are often feared for their consumption of humans as ritual sacrifice and tribute from nearby human villages. Some humans, however, have been sent to the hills to train under the Oni as powerful warriors bearing masks akin to their masters."
 barter_with_dark_spirits:0 "Barter with Dark Spirits"
 desc_barter_with_dark_spirits:0 "Haless is full of supernatural spirits, some good, and some most definitely bad. Our cousins in the Righteous Path see these dark spirits as something to avoid and banish, but perhaps accepting, listening and appeasing rather than fearing them may grant us greater power."
 wisdom_beyond_honor:0 "Wisdom beyond Honor"
 desc_wisdom_beyond_honor:0 ""Honour is for mountains. Unmovable, venerable, yet still. Wisdom is like wind. Moving, youthful, and free. A mind must be like wind, if they are to reach true enlightenment." -Monra Kajume"
 advocation_of_chi_stealers:0 "Advocation of Chi-Stealers"
 desc_advocation_of_chi_stealers:0 "Using and manipulating another living thing's lifeforce (chi) has always been taboo in the Righteous Path. But why is it so? Surely the strongest must become stronger, if not for the benefit of one's self, but for the country as a whole?"
 mummy_monks:0 "Mummy Monks"
 desc_mummy_monks:0 "The way to enlightenment is a long one, and often requires years upon years of meditation and contemplation. For most, death is the great inhibitor to enlightenment, but what if it was not? By invoking dark rituals and strange methods of embalming we may be able to preserve our monk's minds in meditation even when the body begins to fail."
 way_of_the_shadows:0 "Way of the Shadows"
 desc_way_of_the_shadows:0 "The threat of The Command looms across Haless and as countless villages are conquered many of the peasantry have begun to act against their hobgoblin overlords of their own accord rather than waiting for nominal powers to come to their rescue. The acceptance of 'shadow warriors', or 'ninja', against hobgoblins and even tyrannous Halessi lords in our land may be of benefit to our survival."
 organize_the_cults:0 "Organize the Cults"
 desc_organize_the_cults:0 "There are many shadowy cults and sects of the Lefthand Path. Some are hidden away in the tenets of village folk belief, some are mystery organizations in the darkest cities and others are simply wayward adherants following their own path away from the norms. If we are to solidify ourselves as a nation state we must bring these cults to our control."
 witches_and_shamans:0 "Witches and Shamans"
 desc_witches_and_shamans:0 "Those that wield magic using other sources beyond one's own natural energy (chi) are usually seen as outcasts away from mainstream society, or at best, oddities best left alone. By opening ourselves to learn from these pagan priests, wielders of what the sun elves called 'arcane magic' and hedge witches lurking in the most remote of villages, we may open ourselves to a new road on the Lefthand Path."
