 dartaxagerdim_events.2.t:0 "Reviving the Ancient Arts"
 dartaxagerdim_events.2.d:0 "The Magušim, or art of magic, has been the birthright of the Bulwari ever since Brasan the Emancipator liberated our people from the yoke of the djinn during the age of the Darkness Sultanates, when the Šedu turned from benevolent teachers to merciless slave masters. But this ancient art has suffered increasingly over the last centuries of rule by the Sun Elven usurpers, and many of the remaining practitioners have been lost during the many conflicts in the Decades of Devastation in Bahar. It is our most solemn duty to revive this ancient art.\nHowever, for the time being we can only spare the resources to restore one of the four main Ereš, or knowings, of the Magušim to its former glory. Is it the Ereš-sašur, the art of forcing order onto nature and the elements, that our war-torn lands need the most? Or should we follow the example of Brasan and support the Ereš-dirkešir, the art of binding other beings from this plane or others to the will of the mage? Ereš-malthar, the art of inscription, on the other hand might allow us to create powerful magical items and artifacts. And let us not forget that the Ereš-sar, the knowing of Light, is the magical art most favored by Surakel. Which Ereš should benefit from our efforts?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.2.a:0 "...Order!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.2.b:0 "...Binding!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.2.c:0 "...Inscription!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.2.dd:0 "...Light!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.5.t:0 "An Akali for the Akal!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.d:0 "Dartaxes began his revolt with only his nephew as his heir. Now, as the leader of a kingdom, the unmarried Akal finds himself in need of a bride, and an heir of his own to succeed should he perish."
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.a:0 "Marry the daughter of the szal-Fazil chieftain, Kišar, a powerful mage!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.b:0 "Marry the daughter of Harrum, Zaina, and secure the loyalty of the Šebhuliam."
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.c:0 "Marry the noble born sister of Dartaxes's most trusted lieutenant, Rukhiya szal-Dieshaz!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.6.t:0 "The Spear of Jaher"
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.d:0 "Taken from the Bastard Deggarion's body amidst the ruined remains of his army, the spearhead of Dinatoldir gleams like sunlight, its metal inlaid with glyphs of old and powerful magic. It is a powerful weapon, and even more powerful of a symbol. What should be done with it?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.a:0 "Give it to the szal-Fazil and let them glean what they can from it."
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.b:0 "Parade it at the head of our armies!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.7.t:0 "The Fate of Keladora"
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.d:0 "The once queen of Birzartanšes is brought before you in chains, her eyes cold and betraying nothing of her thoughts. Even at the mercy of her greatest enemy and while her city burns, Keladora shows no remorse or apology for what she has done. It was under her orders that the Jaherian Exemplars scoured the holy sites of the Old Sun Cult forcing conversions at sword-point or giving those who refused to the fire. She cannot be allowed to live for such crimes."
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.a:0 "Burn Her at the Stake."
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.b:0 "She was not alone in her crimes. Let all her nobles and retainers burn as well!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.c:0 "There is no such thing as an innocent Elf. Burn them all!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.8.t:0 "The Birzartanšesi Administrative Apparatus"
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.d:0 "The Kingdom of Birzartanšes was administered with a brutal and clinical precision, mainly in part to its expansive bureaucracy and rigorous civil examination system. This system allowed for the documentation and hunting of many Old Sun Cult worshippers, but also allowed for the prosperity of the kingdom."
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.a:0 "Utilize the Birzartanši Bureaucracy."
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.b:0 "Burn every trace of this Vile Instrument."

 dartaxagerdim_events.9.t:0 "Ornaments of the Akal"
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.d:0 "The Akal of Baharšes must be garbed as befitting his status, and must represent his people in all ways."
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.a:0 "A worthy sword to bear against the enemies of Baharšes."
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.b:0 "An ornate tapestry depicting our people's storied history."

 dartaxagerdim_events.10.t:0 "The Elven Question"
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.d:0 "Now that Baharšes has finally been unified once more under a human Akal, the time has come to decide what is to be done with the Sun Elves that still inhabit these lands."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.a:0 "Though they shall never rule over us again, Man and Elf can live side by side."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.b:0 "Four centuries of tyranny can only be answered with four centuries of service to Us."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.c:0 "You do not allow a sickness to fester, a weed to grow. It must be pulled out, root and stem!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.11.t:0 "Storming of Irrliam"
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.d:0 "Irrliam burns. The nexus of the heretical New Sun Cult is now purged and cleansed under Surakel's light. The Sun Elf has been cast down from his lofty palace. The architect of such heresy, Taelarios, is entombed at the heart of the city, within a vast and gaudy mausoleum."
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.a:0 "Scatter his and all of his kin's ashes into the Suran."
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.b:0 "Taelarios is dead. We shall not disturb his rest."

 dartaxagerdim_events.12.t:0 "Desolation of Varamhar"
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.d:0 "The Sun Elf mages proved no match for their human counterparts. Varamahr's walls were torn down, bringing to an end another usurper in Bulwar. Though its mages and priests would be put to the sword, the vast library of knowledge they have curated is innocent of their crimes. There are rumors circling about that the Elves planned to orchestrate a grand ritual on such a scale of perversity that to call it blasphemous would not be enough. Our mages say they planned to raise one of their own up as divine, as a god."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.a:0 "Glean the secrets of the Ulmis Idiqlat with the aid of the Szal-Fazil."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.b:0 "Burn the heretics and their blasphemous teachings!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.13.t:0 "Scourging of Sareyand"
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.d:0 "The Sun Elves of Sareyand had long considered themselves to be the mighty Phoenix Legions that had forged an empire which stretched from Tianlou in the east to the city of Anbenncost in the west. Their discipline was said to have been unmatched, and skill in arms without equal among even the Elves. And yet, Sareyand's walls crumble under a hail of magefire and cannonade, and the once invincible Ash Legion lose heart, throwing down their arms in the face of the relentless advance of the Šebhuliam. They receive the same mercy that had been offered to countless humans at their hand. The Ash Legions have been defeated, and Sareyand has fallen."
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.a:0 "Reform our armies with the lessons of the Ash Legions."
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.b:0 "Burn the heretics and their blasphemous teachings!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.14.t:0 "The Šebhuliam Revolt"
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.d:0 "Our efforts to curtail the Šebhuliam's influence in both our administration and military has been a successful, if difficult, endeavor. Many of their ministers have been sacked, officers reassigned to minor positions, and missionaries relegated to preaching on the fringes of our akalate. The Šebhuliam, fearing that the power they have wielded since our akalate's founding will be stripped from them once and for all, have finally risen in open revolt against our rule."
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.a:0 "Down with the Rebel!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.15.t:0 "Heir offered to join the Šebhuliam"
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.d:0 "The Šebhuliam have always been a sect shrouded in mystery. The practices of the militant order are unknown to all but the sparse few initiated into their inner ranks. They now offer our heir the chance to join their group."
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.a:0 "Accept the offer. They will make a proper warrior out of them."
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.b:0 "Princes do not need the guidance of religious fanatics."

 dartaxagerdim_events.16.t:0 "Wishcrafters of Bahar"
 dartaxagerdim_events.16.d:0 "Kurešim or Wishcrafting is an ancient magical practice that dates back to the Šedu, or djinn, and their human successors, the God-kings of ancient Bulwar. While many of the wonders described in the tales of lost Ilu-Kadišayya, the ancient center of Šedu wishcrafting, are beyond our capabilities, as the art of Genie-binding has been lost and therefore our mages no longer have command over the wish magic possessed by the djinn, the ingenuity of the disciples of Ereš-malthar, the art of inscription, has in many aspects made up for that loss of knowledge. We may not be able to craft Wishblades like they are described in our legends, but the inscripted tools of the Kurešimi can provide an immense benefit for our craftsmen. Should we turn the fallen leaves of the Bahari forests into the finest paper, the rough woolen scrapings from our herds into the most diaphanous silks or the rocky detritus from our mines into the most marvelous gems?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.16.a:0 "Paper to document our accomplishments for posterity."
 dartaxagerdim_events.16.b:0 "Silk to adorn our most noble subjects."
 dartaxagerdim_events.16.c:0 "Gems to fill our treasure chambers."

 dartaxagerdim_events.21.t:0 "Return of the Sad Natu"
 dartaxagerdim_events.21.d:0 "The Gnolls have been driven out, The Cleaver of Realms is now split in twain. The shadow of the monsters that long haunted Bulwar has been irrevocably banished beneath Surakel's fiery light. Our lost kin, The Šad Natu, once scattered to the four winds, may return home once more."
 dartaxagerdim_events.21.a:0 "Welcome Home, Brother."

 dartaxagerdim_events.22.t:0 "The Szalmusar"
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.d:0 "The descendants of Ašuru szal-Hamuranz rose to become the second family within the Akalate of Dartaxagerdim, serving as the right hand and staunch supporters of the royal family, on account of their shared kinship. The Szalmušar, as they were collectively known, were the leading religious family within the Akalate and assured the legitimacy of the House of szel-Forramaz. In addition, as hereditary lords of the Šebhuliam Order, they commanded the absolute loyalty of the thousands of shock troops that made up the Akalate's Armies."
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.a:0 "Integrate the role of the Szalmušar into the descendants of Dartaxes."
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.b:0 "Allow for the Szalmušar to ensure the stability of our regime."

 dartaxagerdim_events.30.a:0 "Let all the world quake beneath our footsteps."
 dartaxagerdim_events.30.b:0 "We are Surakel's Wrath."

 dartaxagerdim_events.50.t:0 "Šebhuliam Seize a Noble's Estate"
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.d:0 "A council of Šebhuliam-aligned clerics have found a prominent local noble guilty of heresy, of which the punishment is to burn at the stake, his lands given to the crown. Many of the noble's allies have come before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to plead for their intercession on behalf of the condemned. At the same time, representatives of the Šebhuliam have also arrived at the royal palace, urging the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to not interfere with matters of faith."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.a:0 "The Šebhuliam overstep their bounds. Clear the noble of all charges."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.b:0 "Our Faith must be kept pure. Heresy cannot be tolerated."

 dartaxagerdim_events.51.t:0 "Šebhuliam Request Land for Stronghold"
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.d:0 "The Šebhuliam have long survived against the attempts of the New Sun Cult's inquisitors, the Jaherian Exemplars, through their network of fortifications centered around the Kuzak Mountains. These remote redoubts have endured for decades and have evolved to serve as strongholds and centers of operations for the Šebhuliam as the Akalate has expanded."
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.a:0 "A strong Šebhuliam means a strong Akalate."
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.b:0 "They have enough strongholds."

 F22_reform_legions_title:0 "Establish the Dartaxian Legions"
 F22_reform_legions_desc:0 "Our rule extends from Gem Isle to the plains of the Suran. Our once-fledgling movement bloomed into a kingdom and now stands as a proud empire, the first seen in Bulwar since the days of Jaher. No matter our reservations, we will take lessons from his success and form our own armies, whose ability and power will overshadow even the infamous Phoenix Legions."

What precisely the aim of these experiments is, appears somewhat unclear to all but the most knowledgeable in arcane matters. To satisfy their insistent demands many at court suggest to secure a secure supply of it for ourselves, or at least find a reliable ally or subject willing to supply us with Damestear. Others point out that we might do well to secure the favor of the master Kurešimi residing in Kurešim-kišbar, the city of Wishcrafters nestled in the bosom of sacred Mount Lazzaward, who might provide us with access to Anniwan, an alloy of Damestear, tin and powdered lapis lazuli, which would greatly reduce our need for raw Damestear while retaining its magical potency."

While the nobility have proven their loyalty to us, the Šebhuliam's ambitions may one day rise to challenge the authority of the Akal himself, which can not be allowed for the stability of the realm. Removing them, however, will be a difficult and costly task."

 dartaxagerdim_rebuild_the_magi_desc:0 "The human mages of Bulwar have been scattered to the four winds, forced into hiding by Elven persecution. Our Akalte is a beacon of hope to them, and from far Salahad, an emissary of the Mašnsih, Kisar szal-Fazil, daughter of the clan head and a powerful mage, has offered her service to our cause in exchange for helping to restore the ranks of human mages in Baharšes."

 dartaxagerdim_new_house_wisdom_desc:0 "The Houses of Wisdom are the traditional gathering places for practitioners of Bulwari magic. Here they could impart their knowledge to their disciples, practice their art undisturbed and join together for greater magical workings. However, due to the suppression of human mages by many Sun Elven realms and the devastation wrought by the internecine wars, rebellions and invasions of the last decades, many Houses of Wisdom have closed their doors forever.  With the rise of our Akalate it is only fitting that our capital will welcome a new House of Wisdom within its walls."

 dartaxagerdim_palace_of_magi_desc:0 "Workers employed in the salt ponds along the shore of lake Garlas have reportedly made an exciting discovery. Ancient ruins that might very well date back to the semi-mythical age of the Radiant Sultanates of the Šedu have been uncovered. There is already fervent speculation among scholars of djinn lore that it might well be the ruins of Is-Kuršag, one of the four main centers of the Šedu, where the djinn experimented with the effects of the Wish on our material plane. Our mages are intent on unearthing the secrets of the djinn and have petitioned the Akal to establish a school of magic at lake Garlas to allow the excavation of the nearby ruins."

As exorcist-priests they, unlike their brethren in the other Ereš, operate under the jurisdiction of the temples and practice their art solely for the glory of Surakel and to the benefit of His people. By expanding the temple-complex of our capital to provide housing and training facilities for them, they can be convinced to lend their strength to our just cause."

They plan to return Bulwar to an age of magocratic rule, where the Magi rule absolutely over their devoted subjects. Should we nourish these vipers at our bosom so they may continue to strike at our enemies, or should we cut off the head of the snake before its venom reaches the heart of our realm?"

 dartaxagerdim_codify_religion_desc:0 "Dartaxes secured the allegiance with the Šebhuliam under the condition that his Akalte would expand the message of Harrum and his followers across all of Bulwar, a monumental task as the Old Sun Cult had always been a wide umbrella of pre-Jaherian traditions. But, with the aid of many influential Šebhuliam missionaries and ministers, the message of the Šebhuliam could be adjusted and made universal to all the worshippers of Surakel."

The royal family, the house of szal-Forramaz, would have absolute authority over all temporal matters - the nobles, the merchants, and all other secular aspects of the realm. The house of szal-Hamuranz, referred to as the Szalmušar, the Blood of the Founder, would command complete control of the state's religious apparatus as well as ensuring the loyalty of the fanatic Šebhuliam."

Borne from the increased cooperation and acceptance of the Šebhuliam's message by the Magi, the Scorch Priests are zealous, fanatic, and immensely lethal. These masters of Evocation magic bring the inferno, and leave only ash in their wake. Paired with the fearless Šebhuliam shock troops, they are a potent and nigh-unstoppable fighting force in Bulwar."

Our court mage has already expressed his vocal support and urges our Akal to accept the invitation. Other courtiers are more reticent, but even they consider a voyage to lake Garlas necessary, if only to conduct a covert investigation into the rumors of illicit activities and strange events at the academy."

During the banquet in his honor many speeches were held exhorting the wisdom of our Akal to continue to support the efforts in uncovering the lost secrets of our magical heritage and how it is the birthright of every magically gifted Bulwari to study the arcane lore of his ancestors and wield the power that stems from it. After the festivities have reached their end late in the evening and most participants have already stumbled towards their quarters, our Akal is approached by a group of senior mages who request a discreet audience with him. They reveal that they are emissaries of a hidden sorcerous cabal striving to work for the greater good of all Bulwari by uncovering the lost secrets of the Magušim art and return Bulwari magic to its rightful place. What exactly that would entail is left somewhat vague in their presentation. They explain that they have been granted permission to invite the Akal into their ranks. While the Akal is not a scholar of magic or ancient history, even he has heard tales of the followers of Hašahu, the Serpent-king, who have espoused very similar goals"
