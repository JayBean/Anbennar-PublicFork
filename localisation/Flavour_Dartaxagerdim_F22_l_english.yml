 dartaxagerdim_events.1.t:0 "Ancient site Found!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.1.d:0 "After years of searching the countryside and a dozen failed digs, our archaeologists have finally found what we were looking for: an ancient site that seems to be from the period of Djinn Sultanates! What's more, while it initially seemed to be a small site, that was only the tip of a massive palace underground complex, apparently once housing genies hiding from Brasan the Emancipator and the human genie-binders he taught. Though we have only reached the precipice, our magi have started with carefully dismantling the defensive magic of the place, and learning the long forgotten arts of genie magic along the way."
 dartaxagerdim_events.1.a:0 "Let's see what we've found!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.2.t:0 "Reviving the Ancient Arts"
 dartaxagerdim_events.2.d:0 "The study of magic is an investment of generations, and as such it has taken years to study ancient magics. Now, after some of the best minds of our college have bent themselves over the genie artifacts, they have been able to extract some spells from their depths. These spells all seem to revolve around one specific school of magic. We have been able to learn ancient Genie secrets from the great school of..."

 dartaxagerdim_events.3.t:0 "A Faithful Decision"
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.d:0 "Once, the faith was clear. Surakel had sacrificed himself for the safety of our people. But with the coming of Jaher to Brasan, the priests down in Bulwar declared him to be his divine incarnation. He did well, he freed us from the gnolls and forged Bulwar into a great empire. But he died, and his successors the 'Sun' Elves have been but pale impressions of his radiance. Now there is disagreement; many say the Sun Elves now all share the spirit of Surakel. But in the far east, a group of Sun Elves has started saying that it's not only Sun Elves that have to fulfill Surakel's duties, but that it falls to all. However, there are still those closer to home who say that Jaher was never the incarnation of Surakel and that we must still wait for the reincarnation of our Sun God. What do we believe?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.a:0 "Jaher was a fraud, we must wait longer still."
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.b:0 "After Jaher, Surakel's duties fall to us all."
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.c:0 "I guess the Sun Elves are the true successors?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.4.t:0 "Ziggurat of Surakel has been completed!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.4.d:0 "It has been slowly arising over the city of [Root.GetName], now finally it is complete. Thousands of masons, hundreds of sculptors, dozens of painters and metalworkers have laboured for ten years to complete this marvel of architecture. We have truly built one of the wonders of the world. Let the world see the glory of Surakel!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.4.a:0 "Praise the Sun!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.t:0 "An Akali for the Akal!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.d:0 "Dartaxes began his revolt with only his nephew as his heir. Now, as the leader of a kingdom, the unmarried Akal finds himself in need of a bride, and an heir of his own to succeed should he perish."
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.a:0 "Marry the daughter of the szal-Fazil chieftain, Kišar, a powerful mage!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.b:0 "Marry the daughter of Harrum, Zaina, and secure the loyalty of the Šebhuliam."
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.c:0 "Marry the noble born sister of Dartaxes's most trusted lieutenant, Rukhiya szal-Dieshaz!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.t:0 "The Spear of Jaher"
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.d:0 "Taken from the Bastard Deggarion's body amidst the ruined remains of his army, the spearhead of Dinatoldir gleams like sunlight, its metal inlaid with glyphs of old and powerful magic. It is a powerful weapon, and even more powerful of a symbol. What should be done with it?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.a:0 "Give it to the szal-Fazil and let them glean what they can from it."
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.b:0 "Parade it at the head of our armies!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.t:0 "The Fate of Keladora"
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.d:0 "The once queen of Birzartanšes is brought before you in chains, her eyes cold and betraying nothing of her thoughts. Even at the mercy of her greatest enemy and while her city burns, Keladora shows no remorse or apology for what she has done. It was under her orders that the Jaherian Exemplars scoured the holy sites of the Old Sun Cult forcing conversions at sword-point or giving those who refused to the fire. She cannot be allowed to live for such crimes."
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.a:0 "Burn Her at the Stake."
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.b:0 "She was not alone in her crimes. Let all her nobles and retainers burn as well!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.c:0 "There is no such thing as an innocent Elf. Burn them all!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.t:0 "The Birzartanšesi Administrative Apparatus"
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.d:0 "The Kingdom of Birzartanšes was administered with a brutal and clinical precision, mainly in part to its expansive bureaucracy and rigorous civil examination system. This system allowed for the documentation and hunting of many Old Sun Cult worshippers, but also allowed for the prosperity of the kingdom."
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.a:0 "Utilize the Birzartanši Bureaucracy."
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.b:0 "Burn every trace of this Vile Instrument."
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.t:0 "Ornaments of the Akal"
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.d:0 "The Akal of Baharšes must be garbed as befitting his status, and must represent his people in all ways."
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.a:0 "A worthy sword to bear against the enemies of Baharšes."
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.b:0 "An ornate tapestry depicting our people's storied history."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.t:0 "The Elven Question"
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.d:0 "Now that Baharšes has finally been unified once more under a human Akal, the time has come to decide what is to be done with the Sun Elves that still inhabit these lands."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.a:0 "Though they shall never rule over us again, Man and Elf can live side by side."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.b:0 "Four centuries of tyranny can only be answered with four centuries of service to Us."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.c:0 "You do not allow a sickness to fester, a weed to grow. It must be pulled out, root and stem!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.t:0 "Storming of Irrliam"
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.d:0 "Irrliam burns. The nexus of the heretical New Sun Cult is now purged and cleansed under Surakel's light. The Sun Elf has been cast down from his lofty palace. The architect of such heresy, Taelarios, is entombed at the heart of the city, within a vast and gaudy mausoleum."
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.a:0 "Scatter his and all of his kin's ashes into the Suran."
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.b:0 "Taelarios is dead. We shall not disturb his rest."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.t:0 "Desolation of Varamhar"
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.d:0 "The Sun Elf mages proved no match for their human counterparts. Varamahr's walls were torn down, bringing to an end another usurper in Bulwar. Though its mages and priests would be put to the sword, the vast library of knowledge they have curated is innocent of their crimes. There are rumors circling about that the Elves planned to orchestrate a grand ritual on such a scale of perversity that to call it blasphemous would not be enough. Our mages say they planned to raise one of their own up as divine, as a god."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.a:0 "Glean the secrets of the Ulmis Idiqlat with the aid of the Szal-Fazil."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.b:0 "Burn the heretics and their blasphemous teachings!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.t:0 "Scourging of Sareyand"
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.d:0 "The Sun Elves of Sareyand had long considered themselves to be the mighty Phoenix Legions that had forged an empire which stretched from Tianlou in the east to the city of Anbenncost in the west. Their discipline was said to have been unmatched, and skill in arms without equal among even the Elves. And yet, Sareyand's walls crumble under a hail of magefire and cannonade, and the once invincible Ash Legion lose heart, throwing down their arms in the face of the relentless advance of the Šebhuliam. They receive the same mercy that had been offered to countless humans at their hand. The Ash Legions have been defeated, and Sareyand has fallen."
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.a:0 "Reform our armies with the lessons of the Ash Legions."
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.b:0 "Burn the heretics and their blasphemous teachings!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.t:0 "The Šebhuliam Revolt"
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.d:0 "Our efforts to curtail the Šebhuliam's influence in both our administration and military has been a successful, if difficult, endeavor. Many of their ministers have been sacked, officers reassigned to minor positions, and missionaries relegated to preaching on the fringes of our akalate. The Šebhuliam, fearing that the power they have wielded since our akalate's founding will be stripped from them once and for all, have finally risen in open revolt against our rule."
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.a:0 "Down with the Rebel!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.t:0 "Heir offered to join the Šebhuliam"
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.d:0 "The Šebhuliam have always been a sect shrouded in mystery. The practices of the militant order are unknown to all but the sparse few initiated into their inner ranks. They now offer our heir the chance to join their group."
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.a:0 "Accept the offer. They will make a proper warrior out of them."
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.b:0 "Princes do not need the guidance of religious fanatics."

 dartaxagerdim_events.18.a:0 "Where has everyone gone?."
 dartaxagerdim_events.19.t:0 "The Lightning Legion Revolt"
 dartaxagerdim_events.19.d:0 "It begins with a crack of thunder on the horizon and fiery arcs of lightning snaking across the sky. The World burns and the Legions revolt."
 dartaxagerdim_events.19.a:0 "Ashen Skies!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.20.t:0 "A Man claiming to be God"
 dartaxagerdim_events.20.d:0 "Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Then what does the power of a god do to a mortal man? You should have learned your lessons. The God-kings all ruled and fell to their own hubris. Now, so will you."
 dartaxagerdim_events.20.a:0 "Some things aren't meant for man."
 dartaxagerdim_events.21.t:0 "Return of the Sad Natu"
 dartaxagerdim_events.21.d:0 "The Gnolls have been driven out, The Cleaver of Realms is now split in twain. The shadow of the monsters that  long haunted Bulwar has been irrevocably banished beneath Surakel's fiery light. Our lost kin, The Šad Natu, once scattered to the four winds, may return home once more."
 dartaxagerdim_events.21.a:0 "Welcome Home, Brother."
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.t:0 "The Szalmusar"
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.d:0 "The descendants of Ašuru szal-Hamuranz rose to become the second family within the Akalate of Dartaxagerdim, serving as the right hand and staunch supporters of the royal family, on account of their shared kinship. The Szalmušar, as they were collectively known, were the leading religious family within the Akalate and assured the legitimacy of the House of szel-Forramaz. In addition, as hereditary lords of the Šebhuliam Order, they commanded the absolute loyalty of the thousands of shock troops that made up the Akalate's Armies."
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.a:0 "Integrate the role of the Szalmušar into the descendants of Dartaxes."

 dartaxagerdim_events.50.d:0 "A council of Šebhuliam-aligned clerics have found a prominent local noble guilty of heresy, of which the punishment is to burn at the stake, his lands given to the crown. Many of the noble's allies have come before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to plead for their intercession on behalf of the condemned. At the same time, representatives of the Šebhuliam have also arrived at the royal palace, urging the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to not interfere with matters of faith."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.a:0 "The Šebhuliam overstep their bounds. Clear the noble of all charges."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.b:0 "Our Faith must be kept pure. Heresy cannot be tolerated."


 dartaxagerdim_events.51.t:0 "Šebhuliam Request Land for Stronghold"
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.d:0 "The Šebhuliam have long survived against the attempts of the New Sun Cult's inquisitors, the Jaherian Exemplars, through their network of fortifications centered around the Kuzak Mountains. These remote redoubts have endured for decades and have evolved to serve as strongholds and centers of operations for the Šebhuliam as the Akalate has expanded."
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.a:0 "A strong Šebhuliam means a strong Akalate."
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.b:0 "They have enough strongholds."

 dartaxagerdim_cradle_of_humanity_desc:0 "Bulwar and the life-giving Suran are where Humanity first emerged from. If we are to title ourselves as the true guardians of Bulwar, the city and the river valley must be our own."
 dartax_gnollish_revenge_title:0 "Revenge Upon the Gnolls"
 dartax_gnollish_revenge_desc:0 "After the God Kings, and before the time of Jaher, Bulwar suffered under the terror and yoke of the Gnolls, teeming packs of demon-worshipping monsters that preyed on women and children and brought many under the slaver's lash. They drove many of our kindred from their ancestral homes and even today, over four hundred years later, continue to desecrate Bulwar with their presence. They will be driven out. One and All."

 dartaxagerdim_prepare_storm_desc:0 "With Goblins to the north and west, Elves to the south and east, and all manner of Darkness lurking just out of sight, our nascent kingdom is besieged on all sides. But we will not allow the fire of our faith and freedom to gutter out quietly. Surakel's Light will guide us. To the freedom of Victory or to the liberation of His eternal embrace."

 dartaxagerdim_end_elven_yoke_desc:0 "Jaher may have arrived upon our shores as a liberator, but his descendants and fellows have shown themselves to be nothing more than petty tyrants who blaspheme our faith and use us as pawns in their games. No more. The Yoke will be cast off forevermore. Baharšes deserves an Akal of its own blood. The first Human Akal in centuries. The usurpers of Birzartanšes and Baharkand will be torn down for their crimes against Bulwar."

 dartaxagerdim_akal_baharses_desc:0 "Our land has finally been unified. Baharšes is whole once more, ruled not by tyrannous Elf or slaver Gnoll, but by its own children. Aqatbahar, Re'uyel, Azka-szel-Azka, the great cities of our homeland are in Bahari hands once more. The time has come to proclaim the rebirth of the Akalate of Baharšes, with us as its undisputed rulers."

 dartaxagerdim_wars_of_unification_desc:0 "Baharšes is now a formidable and powerful Akalate in its own right, a beacon of prosperity and freedom for all humans. Sadly, many of our brothers and sisters continue to languish under the rule of the Elven Yoke. Irrliam. Sareyand. Varamhar. Elizna. Their continued presence in Bulwar is a blight and curse to the memory of our ancestors. We shall drive them from our homes with fire and steel, and Surakel's Light will once more shine over all of Bulwar."
 dartaxagerdim_destroy_irrliam_title:0 "Destroy Irrliam"
 dartaxagerdim_destroy_irrliam_desc:0 "Taelarios was the architect of the arch-heresy, professing an Elf as the incarnation of Surakel for the sake of his and his kind's own near-sighted political gains. Our people have suffered for centuries because of this unforgivable crime. Irrliam has become the wealthiest Sun Elven state of Bulwar since then, dominating the wealthy city of Brasan. That will not save them from the punishment that we shall lay upon them. Their existence is forfeit."

 dartaxagerdim_the_jewel_of_bulwar_desc:0 "While Bulwar was often the most important city of the region, Brasan was so just as often. It is time that we take the city under our care, so that no harm might befall the jewel of Bulwar ever again."

 dartaxagerdim_rising_dawn_desc:0 "The Sun Elf usurper-Akalates have been cast down. The arch-heretics and enemies of a free Bulwar have been driven into the sea from whence they came. Now, we stand as a preeminent power in Bulwar, and yet, many of our brothers and sisters in faith and blood continue to languish under the rule of the misguided. All of Bulwar shall be brought under our guardianship, Surakel Wills It!"

 dartaxagerdim_noble_generals_desc:0 "Dartaxes was once a loyal knight and retainer to the Elven rulers of Birzartanšes, until the decades of devastation lifted the veil from his eyes and showed how much suffering the Sun Elves had brought to Bulwar. When he rose in revolt, it was his fellow human nobles and officers whose loyalty and trust he had garnered in war that joined his banner, forming a core group of followers that would ensure the survival of their rebellion."

 dartaxagerdim_humble_bastard_desc:0 "Deggarrion was the bastard son of the Elven Akal of Baharkand who was slain by the Marblehead Goblins. Since the fall of his family, he has ruled a state to our west, a land bountiful in gold and jewels, and has dreams of bringing Baharšes under his own rule.

 dartaxagerdim_bountiful_land_desc:0 "The mages of the szal-Fazil have been instrumental in the success of our cause, guiding us to victory on the battlefield with their war wizards while also helping to restore the old traditions of Bulwari magic lost to the Elves. In turn, we have offered them a haven of safety for them and their descendants to practice their magic freely - so long as they remain loyal to the Akal. In a show of faith, the greatest of their mages have come forth with a proposal to transform our lands in a blooming paradise."

 dartaxagerdim_the_sacking_of_sareyand_desc:0 "Sareyand has done well to hold out against the hordes of Zokka, but that service does not weigh up against their elven rule of rightfully human land. Sareyand will be diminished as their domination over the good Bulwari people will be disbanded."
 dartaxagerdim_curb_sebhuliam_title:0 "Curb the Šebhuliam"
 dartaxagerdim_curb_sebhuliam_desc:0 "The Šebhuliam have slowly gained a large amount of influence in our Akalate. As the forefront of our armies, their partisans have gained influential positions outside of our military, some even rising to serve as trusted ministers and confidants to the Akal themselves. However, their rivalry with the nobility has only been exacerbated with their rising star. While the nobility have proven their loyalty to us, the Šebhuliam's ambitions may one day rise to challenge the authority of the Akal himself, which can not be allowed for the stability of the realm. Removing them, however, will be a difficult and costly task."

 dartaxagerdim_rebuild_the_magi_desc:0 "The human mages of Bulwar have been scattered to the four winds, forced into hiding by Elven persecution. Our Akalte is a beacon of hope to them, and from far Salahad, an emissary of the Masnsih, Kisar szal-Fazil, daughter of the clan head and a powerful mage, has offered her service to our cause in exchange for helping to restore the ranks of human mages in Baharšes."
 dartaxagerdim_establish_magi_sanctuary_title:0 "Establish Magi Tower"
 dartaxagerdim_establish_magi_sanctuary_desc:0 "While our dedication to restoring the ranks of the magi has attracted many hedge wizards and novices, there is a growing need for the establishment of an institution where these would-be mages can be educated and taught to harness their natural talent.

 dartaxagerdim_palace_of_magi_desc:0 "After years of searching the countryside and a dozen failed digs, our archaeologists have finally found what we were looking for: an ancient site that seems to be from the period of Djinn Sultanates! What's more, while it initially seemed to be a small site, that was only the tip of a massive palace underground complex, apparently once housing genies hiding from Brasan the Emancipator and the human genie-binders he taught. Though we have only reached the precipice, our magi have started carefully dismantling the defensive magic of the place, and learning the long forgotten arts of genie magic along the way."
 dartaxagerdim_works_prayer_title:0 "Works and Prayer"
 dartaxagerdim_works_prayer_desc:0 "The combination of Šebhuliam preaching and the increasingly large presence of mages in our capital has led to a unique relationship between the two factions. Though different on the surface, both the Šebhuliam and the szal-Fazil are dedicated to the restoration of the old Bahari and Bulwari traditions lost to time and see our Akalate as the best chance for their cause. Their mutual support of our regime has energized the local populace, leading to increased prosperity in our capital."
 dartaxagerdim_secrets_title:0 "Genie Secrets"
 dartaxagerdim_secrets_desc:0 "Within the sprawling complex of the genie palace of Garlas-kel, our mages and excavators have discovered a number of powerful artifacts dating back to the age of the god kings.

 dartaxagerdim_the_wishes_desc:0 "From deep within the lowest levels of Garlas-Kel, amidst the priceless treasures lost over the millena, a lamp has been discovered. Crafted from simple bronze, its surface is inscribed with old runes that predate even our oldest sources on the Bulwari cuneiform. Held within the Akal's grip, the cool metal thrums with life, and the wind whispers into his ear. "Approach seeker, and make your wish." "
 dartaxagerdim_codify_religion_title:0 "Codifying the Religion"
 dartaxagerdim_codify_religion_desc:0 "Dartaxes secured the allegiance with the Šebhuliam under the condition that his Akalte would expand the message of Harrum and his followers across all of Bulwar, a monumental task as the Old Sun Cult had always been a wide umbrella of pre-Jaherian traditions. But, with the aid of many influential Šebhuliam missionaries and ministers, the message of the Šebhuliam could be adjusted and made universal to all the worshippers of Surakel."
 dartaxagerdim_defend_faith_title:0 "Defender of the Faith"
 dartaxagerdim_defend_faith_desc:0 "We stand all but alone as the only true Akalate in all of Bulwar that holds to the traditions untainted by Elven heresy.

 dartaxagerdim_arm_sebhuliam_desc:0 "The Šebhuliam first began as an offshoot of the Eduz-Nabari, the traditional guardians of the Old Sun Cult's temples. For years they have defended the faithful from their mountain redoubts within the Kuzak Mountain range. Now that we have united the region, it is time to reorganize the Šebhuliam into a fighting force to liberate Baharšes."
 dartaxagerdim_szalmusar_title:0 "The Szalmušar"
 dartaxagerdim_szalmusar_desc:0 "Dartaxes's marriage to the daughter of Ashuru szal-Hamuranz established a power-sharing agreement in the nascent Akalate. The royal family, the house of szal-Forramaz, would have absolute authority over all temporal matters - the nobles, the merchants, and all other secular aspects of the realm. The house of szal-Hamuranz, referred to as the Szalmušar, the Blood of the Founder, would command complete control of the state's religious apparatus as well as ensuring the loyalty of the fanatic Šebhuliam."
 dartaxagerdim_scorch_priests_title:0 "The Scorch Priests"
 dartaxagerdim_scorch_priests_desc:0 "The Scorch Priests are the living omen of Surakel's Wrath. Borne from the increased cooperation and acceptance of the Šebhuliam's message by the Magi, the Scorch Priests are zealous, fanatic, and immensely lethal. These masters of Evocation magic bring the inferno, and leave only ash in their wake. Paired with the fearless Šebhuliam shock troops, they are a potent and nigh-unstoppable fighting force in Bulwar."
