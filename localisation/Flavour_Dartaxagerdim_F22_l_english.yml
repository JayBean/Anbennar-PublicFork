Now, after some of the best minds of our college have bent themselves over the genie artifacts, they have been able to extract some spells from their depths. These spells all seem to revolve around one specific school of magic. We have been able to learn ancient Genie secrets from the great school of..."

 dartaxagerdim_events.5.d:0 "Dartaxes began his revolt with only his nephew as his heir. Now, as the leader of a kingdom, the unmarried Akal finds himself in need of a bride, and an heir of his own to succeed should he perish."
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.a:0 "Marry the daughter of the szal-Fazil chieftain, Kišar, a powerful mage!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.6.d:0 "Taken from the Bastard Deggarion's body amidst the ruined remains of his army, the spearhead of Dinatoldir gleams like sunlight, its metal inlaid with glyphs of old and powerful magic. It is a powerful weapon, and even more powerful of a symbol. What should be done with it?"

 dartaxagerdim_events.6.b:0 "Parade it at the head of our armies!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.7.t:0 "The Fate of Keladora"
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.d:0 "The once queen of Birzartanšes is brought before you in chains, her eyes cold and betraying nothing of her thoughts. Even at the mercy of her greatest enemy and while her city burns, Keladora shows no remorse or apology for what she has done. It was under her orders that the Jaherian Exemplars scoured the holy sites of the Old Sun Cult forcing conversions at sword-point or giving those who refused to the fire. She cannot be allowed to live for such crimes."

 dartaxagerdim_events.8.t:0 "The Birzartanšesi Administrative Apparatus"
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.d:0 "The Kingdom of Birzartanšes was administered with a brutal and clinical precision, mainly in part to its expansive bureaucracy and rigorous civil examination system. This system allowed for the documentation and hunting of many Old Sun Cult worshippers, but also allowed for the prosperity of the kingdom."
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.a:0 "Utilize the Birzartanši Bureaucracy."
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.b:0 "Burn every trace of this Vile Instrument."

 dartaxagerdim_events.11.t:0 "Storming of Irrliam"
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.d:0 "Irrliam burns. The nexus of the heretical New Sun Cult is now purged and cleansed under Surakel's light. The Sun Elf has been cast down from his lofty palace. The architect of such heresy, Taelarios, is entombed at the heart of the city, within a vast and gaudy mausoleum."
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.a:0 "Scatter his and all of his kin's ashes into the Suran."
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.b:0 "Taelarios is dead. We shall not disturb his rest."

 dartaxagerdim_events.12.t:0 "Desolation of Varamhar"
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.d:0 "The Sun Elf mages proved no match for their human counterparts. Varamahr's walls were torn down, bringing to an end another usurper in Bulwar. Though its mages and priests would be put to the sword, the vast library of knowledge they have curated is innocent of their crimes. There are rumors circling about that the Elves planned to orchestrate a grand ritual on such a scale of perversity that to call it blasphemous would not be enough. Our mages say they planned to raise one of their own up as divine, as a god."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.a:0 "Glean the secrets of the Ulmis Idiqlat with the aid of the Szal-Fazil."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.b:0 "Burn the heretics and their blasphemous teachings!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.13.t:0 "Scourging of Sareyand"
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.d:0 "The Sun Elves of Sareyand had long considered themselves to be the mighty Phoenix Legions that had forged an empire which stretched from Tianlou in the east to the city of Anbenncost in the west. Their discipline was said to have been unmatched, and skill in arms without equal among even the Elves. And yet, Sareyand's walls crumble under a hail of magefire and cannonade, and the once invincible Ash Legion lose heart, throwing down their arms in the face of the relentless advance of the Šebhuliam. They receive the same mercy that had been offered to countless humans at their hand. The Ash Legions have been defeated, and Sareyand has fallen."
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.a:0 "Reform our armies with the lessons of the Ash Legions."
 dartaxagerdim_events.13.b:0 "Burn the heretics and their blasphemous teachings!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.14.t:0 "The Šebhuliam Revolt"
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.d:0 "Our efforts to curtail the Šebhuliam's influence in both our administration and military has been a successful, if difficult, endeavor. Many of their ministers have been sacked, officers reassigned to minor positions, and missionaries relegated to preaching on the fringes of our akalate. The Šebhuliam, fearing that the power they have wielded since our akalate's founding will be stripped from them once and for all, have finally risen in open revolt against our rule."
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.a:0 "Down with the Rebel!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.15.t:0 "Heir offered to join the Šebhuliam"
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.d:0 "The Šebhuliam have always been a sect shrouded in mystery. The practices of the militant order are unknown to all but the sparse few initiated into their inner ranks. They now offer our heir the chance to join their group."
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.a:0 "Accept the offer. They will make a proper warrior out of them."
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.b:0 "Princes do not need the guidance of religious fanatics."

 dartaxagerdim_events.21.d:0 "The Gnolls have been driven out, The Cleaver of Realms is now split in twain. The shadow of the monsters that long haunted Bulwar has been irrevocably banished beneath Surakel's fiery light. Our lost kin, The Šad Natu, once scattered to the four winds, may return home once more."
 dartaxagerdim_events.21.a:0 "Welcome Home, Brother."

 dartaxagerdim_events.22.t:0 "The Szalmusar"
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.d:0 "The descendants of Ašuru szal-Hamuranz rose to become the second family within the Akalate of Dartaxagerdim, serving as the right hand and staunch supporters of the royal family, on account of their shared kinship. The Szalmušar, as they were collectively known, were the leading religious family within the Akalate and assured the legitimacy of the House of szel-Forramaz. In addition, as hereditary lords of the Šebhuliam Order, they commanded the absolute loyalty of the thousands of shock troops that made up the Akalate's Armies."
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.a:0 "Integrate the role of the Szalmušar into the descendants of Dartaxes."

 dartaxagerdim_events.50.t:0 "Šebhuliam Seize a Noble's Estate"
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.d:0 "A council of Šebhuliam-aligned clerics have found a prominent local noble guilty of heresy, of which the punishment is to burn at the stake, his lands given to the crown. Many of the noble's allies have come before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to plead for their intercession on behalf of the condemned. At the same time, representatives of the Šebhuliam have also arrived at the royal palace, urging the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to not interfere with matters of faith."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.a:0 "The Šebhuliam overstep their bounds. Clear the noble of all charges."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.b:0 "Our Faith must be kept pure. Heresy cannot be tolerated."

 dartaxagerdim_events.51.t:0 "Šebhuliam Request Land for Stronghold"
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.d:0 "The Šebhuliam have long survived against the attempts of the New Sun Cult's inquisitors, the Jaherian Exemplars, through their network of fortifications centered around the Kuzak Mountains. These remote redoubts have endured for decades and have evolved to serve as strongholds and centers of operations for the Šebhuliam as the Akalate has expanded."
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.a:0 "A strong Šebhuliam means a strong Akalate."
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.b:0 "They have enough strongholds."

 dartaxagerdim_arm_sebhuliam_desc:0 "The Šebhuliam first began as an offshoot of the Eduz-Nabari, the traditional guardians of the Old Sun Cult's temples. For years they have defended the faithful from their mountain redoubts within the Kuzak Mountain range. Now that we have united the region, it is time to reorganize the Šebhuliam into a fighting force to liberate Baharšes."

 dartaxagerdim_szalmusar_desc:0 "Dartaxes's marriage to the daughter of Ashuru szal-Hamuranz established a power-sharing agreement in the nascent Akalate. The royal family, the house of szal-Forramaz, would have absolute authority over all temporal matters - the nobles, the merchants, and all other secular aspects of the realm. The house of szal-Hamuranz, referred to as the Szalmušar, the Blood of the Founder, would command complete control of the state's religious apparatus as well as ensuring the loyalty of the fanatic Šebhuliam."

 dartaxagerdim_scorch_priests_desc:0 "The Scorch Priests are the living omen of Surakel's Wrath. Borne from the increased cooperation and acceptance of the Šebhuliam's message by the Magi, the Scorch Priests are zealous, fanatic, and immensely lethal. These masters of Evocation magic bring the inferno, and leave only ash in their wake. Paired with the fearless Šebhuliam shock troops, they are a potent and nigh-unstoppable fighting force in Bulwar."

We will build the greatest temple for our radiant god, a single towering Ziggurat that reaches farther towards the sun than any other building in all of the known world. Let us commission the best architects of Bulwar for this task."

Their initiative in preserving the Bulwari magical tradition has been so successful, however, that the szal-Fazil have encountered an unexpected problem: the current facilities are insufficient to handle the ever-increasing influx of students. The current headmaster of the college has come to request a royal edict to expand the college's grounds and continue the exploration of the genie palace beneath the school's foundation."
