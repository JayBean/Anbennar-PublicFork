 skewered_drake_take_west_title:0 "Take the West"
 skewered_drake_take_west_desc:0 "Thanks to our intrepid scouts, we've managed to map a course out west and to Hul-Jorkad. The logical next step is to seize it for ourselves. The first conquest of orckind shall soon be ours to pillage. And why stop there? There are always other lands to discover and conquer..."
 skewered_drake_take_west_tooltip:0 "If §YGashak§! is still ruler then he will gain:"

 skewered_drake_hills_sunlight_title:0 "Hills of Sunlight"
 skewered_drake_hills_sunlight_desc:0 "Before we took Hul-Jorkad, few of us thought our next conquest from there would be outside the Serpentspine. Yet the hold connects to the outside world, giving us a great view of the surface. From here we can see the cresting hills, casting shadows and catching light as the sun moves across the sky. We've also noticed strange winged creatures taking flight, and occasionally trying to abduct one of our orcs. A perfect place for our next conquest."

 ###2###
 skewered_drake_chieftains_hoard_title:0 "Chieftain's Hoard"
 skewered_drake_chieftains_hoard_desc:0 "Though orcs are not greedy in the same way as dwarves or goblins are, we still respect a good hoard. The value itself is irrelevant, of course- what matters is the show of strength involved in claiming such a prize. For a leader especially, a large hoard is more than an accumulation of things. It is a symbol of authority and strength, which in turn comes with respect and subservience from other orcs.\n\nYet all the strength and authority in the world is useless if one does not use it. Our chieftain understands this well. With the right focus, he can not only increase his hold over Skewered Drake, but the territories surrounding us as well."

 skewered_drake_riding_roads_title:0 "Riding the Roads"
 skewered_drake_riding_roads_desc:0 "Though our drakons are fierce beasts in battle, just as valuable is their speed and maneuverability. At the same time, the old roads of the Dwarovar offer promises of loot and conquest should we decide to follow them. Using our drakon riders, we can effectively explore large lengths of road until we discover something of value attached to them."

 skewered_drake_piles_gold_title:0 "Piles of Gold"
 skewered_drake_piles_gold_desc:0 "The decadence of the dwarves was always known to us, yet few could have imagined the sheer depth of it until they set eyes on Verkal Gulan. It seems hard to venture anywhere within this hold without finding gold, gold, and more gold. Yet all the gold they could dig did not save them from conquest in the end. Now their hold is ours to pillage and plunder, and we don't intend to stop until the entire place is barren."

 skewered_drake_obedient_trolls_title:0 "Obedient Trolls"
 skewered_drake_obedient_trolls_desc:0 "The trolls of the Greatcaverns are a curious breed, to be certain. By all accounts, their kind are brutish and confrontational, and we expected just as much resistance from them as the goblins and dwarves we've thus far conquered. Instead, they seem oddly docile, going to great lengths to pacify us and avoid conflict. While we've yet to understand this behavior, it could be used to our advantage. Perhaps if we reciprocate these gestures, we may make these trolls into loyal subjects."
 skewered_drake_obedient_trolls_tooltip:0 "Every province owned by §YGrizehûd§! except the §YGreatcaverns area§! will be transferred to us"

 skewered_drake_first_many_title:0 "First of Many"
 skewered_drake_first_many_desc:0 "As our expansion heads inexorably eastwards, our forces approach the dwarven hold of Hehodovar and Seghdihr.\n\nWhile the former has long been abandoned by the treacherous dwarves, the citrine dwarves have long managed to stand firm against threats from inside and outside the mountains. The time has come to show that we are the new hegemon of the Middle Dwarovar. We will claim Hehodovar as our own and loot its halls of anything of worth and show the rulers of Seghdihr that their dominance over the mountains is well and truly over."

 skewered_drake_learn_vanquished_title:0 "Learn from the Vanquished"
 skewered_drake_learn_vanquished_desc:0 "With the capture of Seghdihr, a new world has opened up to us. While we had heard rumors about the lands outside of our mountain homes from far traveled Orcs and our slaves, now we can see it for ourselves simply by looking out of the gates of the hold.\n\nWhile the dwarves are a weak and cowardly people, we cannot deny they have a sense for commerce, and perhaps none more than the Citrine Dwarves. The capture of their hold has not only yielded wealth and weapons, but also hundreds of maps and scrolls detailing the lands and people beyond its gates. We should study these before we push out into these new sun drenched lands. According to the prisoners we took, the locals call it Bulwar."

 skewered_drake_roads_sand_title:0 "Roads of Sand"
 skewered_drake_roads_sand_desc:0 "Just beyond the gates of Seghdihr, in the sun drenched foothills watered by the headwaters of the Suran, lie the lands of Azka-Sur. With its command of the upper Suran and the trade routes between the Bulwar and Rahen, it could be a rich and influential city. Yet years of hardship and neglect have resulted in weakness and disrepair.\n\nUnder our rule we will restore its rightful place in Bulwar and grow fat from the resulting bounty."

 skewered_drake_claim_dominion_title:0 "Claim Dominion"
 skewered_drake_claim_dominion_desc:0 "We have proven ourselves more than capable of rulership, not simply over a tribe, but over a kingdom. Where once we contented ourselves with stalking the roads and caves of the Serpentspine, we now not only stand as the undisputed lords of the Middle Dwarovar, but even claim authority beyond the mountains. Certainly claiming authority is useless if one cannot back it up, and we are more than capable of backing up our claims. So why not make those grand claims? Let the world know that we do not simply intend to build a great orcish kingdom - we already have."
 skewered_drake_claim_dominion_tooltip:0 "If we are fully §Ydemonsterized§! we will gain +§G2§! §Ystability§!"

 ###4###
 skewered_drake_out_wound_title:0 "Out of the Wound"
 skewered_drake_out_wound_desc:0 "For many centuries we have lived in the ruins of Gor Vazumbrog. The awakening of the great purple dragon, only known as the Hunter of the Deep, during the Dragonwake almost caused the collapse of the entire hold. Even to this day its lower levels are filled with the toxic vapors exhaled by the dragon during their awakening and subsequent razing of the hold.\nAfter our ancestors settled in the ruins we learned to live with and eventually tame the drakons of the area, an alliance that proved advantageous to both sides. With the numbers of orcs and drakons within the hold growing beyond what the hold and surrounding tunnels can support, the time has come to expand beyond the borders of our traditional lands. We should assemble the shamans to ask for the blessing of Dookan for this endeavor before we finalize our plans."

 skewered_drake_food_body_title:0 "Food for the Body"
 skewered_drake_food_body_desc:0 "Unlike warm blooded creatures, the growth rate of our drakons is not fixed, but largely depends on the availability of sufficient feed. In order to raise a large number of war mounts, providing a continuous stream of high quality feed is therefore of prime importance.\n\nAs our domain grows, so has the demand for drakons and in turn the demand for drakon feed.\n\nThankfully they are not particularly picky creatures, eating nearly anything they can close their jaws around. We should expand our livestock and farms in order to meet this growing demand."

 skewered_drake_alpha_breed_title:0 "The Alpha Breed"
 skewered_drake_alpha_breed_desc:0 "While severely diminished in number, the hunting parties we send into the tunnels to stalk the newly discovered alpha drakons have returned in triumph. Alongside some truly massive hunting trophies, they also managed to steal several clutches of enormous drakon eggs, all in different colors.\n\nOur trainers have taken over their care and informed us that most of the eggs have hatched into a ferocious clutch of hatchlings. We will distribute these hatchlings amongst our heirs, securing the dominance of our family over the tribe."
 skewered_drake_alpha_breed_tooltip:0 "Every §YRuler§! will now be able to §Ttrain§! one of these §YAlpha Drakons§! when they take the throne"

 ###5###
 skewered_drake_end_dreams_title:0 "End the Dreams"
 skewered_drake_end_dreams_desc:0 "When we cast out Zog Shadowdreamer and his ilk for their heretical beliefs, it was expected that this sorry band of outcasts would not last long. Surely they would end up torn apart by one of the many horrors stalking the tunnels and caves, or be dispatched by one of the other tribes. However, like the cave roaches they are, they managed to survive and multiply. Zog has sent out shamans to spread his cult to the surrounding tribes, and a steady trickle of converts is swelling the ranks of their warband.\n\nWe need to smother the risk that Zog and his zealots pose in the cradle. Only then will our dominance over the orcs of the Middle Dwarovar be fully secured."

 skewered_drake_drakedens_title:0 "The Drakedens"
 skewered_drake_drakedens_desc:0 "While Gor Vazumbrog has long been the center of our drakon taming operations, it is far from the only area where these creatures thrive.\n\nRecently, our chief drakon trainer has informed us that his apprentices have identified an area in the misty cave trail that could serve as a prime breeding and training ground for our war mounts.\n\nAll the area lacks is the necessary infrastructure to support the new drake dens. With the ever growing need for new mounts, it would be well advised to fund these expansions from our treasury."



 ###1B###
 skewered_drake_broken_alliance_title:0 "Broken Alliance"
 skewered_drake_broken_alliance_desc:0 "For centuries, the so-called Segbandal, an alliance of dwarven holds in the Middle Dwarovar, resisted orcish attempts at conquest. Yet time has not been kind to this alliance, nor have our drakon riders. Disaster after disaster whittled them down, until we were at last able to ride in and secure the remnants for ourselves. What once seemed so illusive to our ancestors is now firmly within our grasp. The Segbandal has been shattered, and so it shall remain."

 skewered_drake_picking_scraps_title:0 "Picking through Scraps"
 skewered_drake_picking_scraps_desc:0 "At long last, the holds have been bled dry. Where once stood decadent monuments to a bygone age, there now lies only rubble and our war camps. This does not mean this land has lost its utility to us, however. Indeed, much of the Middle Dwarovar shows promise for industry and production. With the resources we've pillaged from the once great holds, we can begin to make this promise a reality."
 skewered_drake_picking_scraps_tooltip:0 "This §Ymodifier§! will apply to all our §Yfuture Warcamps§! as well"

 skewered_drake_visible_dread_title:0 "Visible Dread"
 skewered_drake_visible_dread_desc:0 "In our earlier days of stalking the caves of the Serpentspine, stealth was a valuable tool. Our enemies were many, and while we were strong, we were also few. Camouflage and sneak attacks helped make up the deficit in strength and brought us to where we are today. Yet these tactics are far less effective on the surface, where the sun shines down upon all things. It is therefore time to abandon this old thinking. For all the terror our drakons can inspire, why should we hide? Let us fit them in black armor, so that our enemies will know us and fear us at a glance."

 skewered_drake_climbing_trees_title:0 "Climbing Trees"
 skewered_drake_climbing_trees_desc:0 "The Tree of Stone is a disorienting place. Caverns twist and wind about without any apparent rhyme or reason. Sometimes they loop back into themselves. Sometimes a passage is really a dead end. Sometimes a dead end really leads to five new paths. While frustrating and confusing, exploring the Tree of Stone has also proven enlightening for our scouts. They've now learned how better to navigate the cavernous terrain of the Serpentspine, as well as how to find things of value within it. We'll be able to apply these lessons well even on familiar terrain."
 skewered_drake_climbing_trees_tooltip:0 "§Y3§! expeditions will spawn in the §YMiddle Dwarovar§!"
 skewered_drake_climbing_trees_tooltip2:0 "Every owned province in the §YMiddle Dwarovar§! with a §Ymetal§! trade good will gain §G+1§! production."

 skewered_drake_one_master_another_title:0 "One Master to Another"
 skewered_drake_one_master_another_desc:0 "The Hobgoblin Command think of themselves as masters. They hold tight to the reigns of their goblin and orc subjects. They may even believe themselves to be a worthy rival to us. We must shatter that delusion. In truth, they are not worthy of the servants they hold onto so tightly. Far better that they serve us instead, and that the hobgoblins learn their place. It is Drakonshan, not the Command, which shall rule."
 skewered_drake_one_master_another_tooltip:0 "Every province will gain §R+10§! unrest"


 ###2B###
 skewered_drake_funding_future_title:0 "Funding the Future"
 skewered_drake_funding_future_desc:0 "A growing empire such as ours cannot be sustained by plunder alone. We need to find other means of obtaining gold in order to pay our warriors and administrators. Thankfully the Greatcaverns are rich in gold veins and our troll subjects are perfectly suited to digging the precious metal up. All we need to do is set up the necessary infrastructure in a central location and prod them in the right direction. Soon our hoards will be overflowing with gold to make even the decadent dwarves of Verkal Gulan blush in envy."

 skewered_drake_administering_subjects_title:0 "Administering our Subjects"
 skewered_drake_administering_subjects_desc:0 "We are not the first minority to govern the lands of Bulwar. Long before we left our mountain home, the Sun Elves had already ruled over the lands of Bulwar for centuries: A thin film of oil on top of a sea of humanity.\n\nWe can learn much from them and should endeavor to incorporate their techniques in order to ensure the long term stability of our rule over these lands. Sending observers to one of our more prosperous Sun Elven subjects would provide a good learning opportunity. Mayhaps we should even consider adding an elven advisor or two to our court."
 skewered_drake_administering_subjects_tooltip:0 "Have 3 advisors with §Yat least 2 different non-orcish races§!"
 skewered_drake_administering_subjects_tooltip2:0 "All our current and future §Ysubjects§! will gain:\nNational Tax Modifier: §G+10%§!\nProduction Efficiency: §G+10%§!"

 skewered_drake_might_right_title:0 "Might Makes Right"
 skewered_drake_might_right_desc:0 "While our control of the Middle Dwarovar is beyond any challenge, we have yet to make significant inroads into the caverns beyond Hul Jorkad.\n\nNot far from the hold, the road splits, offering two potential routes for expansion. We may either push West into the Serpentsreach or follow the Western Dwarovar to the North West towards the old capital of the dwarves. Or we just push into both. Once we have secured the subjugation and loyalty of a significant enough population in the caverns, we will be able to leave expansion and governance of these caverns to them."
 skewered_drake_might_right_tooltip:0 "If we have a subject in §Yeach region§! fulfilling the conditions then they will gain §Yclaims§! on §Yboth regions§!"

 skewered_drake_elven_spear_title:0 "Elven Spear"
 skewered_drake_elven_spear_desc:0 "When Jaher united the Phoenix Empire under his rule, he did so wielding a magical spear called Dinaltoldir. Shattered in the chaos following his death, its remains are still held in high esteem by the people of these lands. It is said that whoever restores the spear is destined to reunite the empire of the great conqueror. In order to further legitimize our rule over these lands, we should collect the pieces and reforge the weapon as a symbol of our rightful rulership over these lands. For this we will need to collect every remaining piece of the weapon as well as collect the most skilled smiths from our subjects."

 skewered_drake_symbiotic_warfare_title:0 "Symbiotic Warfare"
 skewered_drake_symbiotic_warfare_desc:0 "Dinaltoldir, the spear of Jaher, was famed for glowing like the sun whenever it was struck in combat. This process was carefully replicated during the reforging process. Once the project was completed, one of the leading craftsmen of the reforging process approached our court. They claim that in the process of restoring Dinaltoldir, they have gained a deep insight into the process by which Dinaltoldir absorbs force and converts it into light, and are confident they can translate this process into lanceheads that would be able to absorb the elemental breaths of our drakons when exposed to them. They have provided a series of prototypes that indeed prove effective. If we can find a way to mass produce them, the already earth shattering charges of our drakons will become truly unstoppable."

 skewered_drake_false_overlord_title:0 "False Overlord"
 skewered_drake_false_overlord_desc:0 "To the Southwest of Bulwar lay the lands of Kheterata, nourished by the waters of the Mother's Sorrow. The region has long suffered under the rulership of the Khet, capricious cat headed creatures stalking these lands, and their appointed governors titled as Steward of the Sorrow. Instead of bowing to these creatures, the people of Kheterata need a rightful ruler like ourselves. We will shatter the stewards' armies and break the Khets grip on these lands. Once their system of power has been dismantled, we will incorporate these lands as a rightful part of our domain."
 skewered_drake_false_overlord_tooltip:0 "The §YSeize Resources§! government power will now target up to §Y4 subjects§!"


 ###3B###
 skewered_drake_drakelords_throne_title:0 "Drakelord's Throne"
 skewered_drake_drakelords_throne_desc:0 "With our expansion, it has become increasingly untenable to administer our whole domain from the depths of Gor Vazumbrog.\n\nThe human city of Azka-Sur, right outside the hold of Seghdihr, would be the perfect surface capital, allowing us to govern our sundrenched domain of Bulwar and also easily call upon reinforcements from our heartland in the caverns, should it be necessary. Before it is up to the task of serving as a second administrative seat however, it needs to be expanded and properly fortified."

 skewered_drake_planting_seeds_title:0 "Planting the Seeds"
 skewered_drake_planting_seeds_desc:0 "For centuries, raiding and taking what we needed from our neighbors has been a core way we used to sustain our tribe and its growth. While this has worked even through our recent conquests, this method has become increasingly unsustainable.\n\nOutside of our garrison strongholds, every patrol is alone in a sea of other races. While we have so far been successful in supporting ourselves by extracting what we needed from the subjugated, this will not work forever. Even now, many farms in our domain lay fallow, torched by our warriors due to the farmers not being able to satisfy their extortionate hunger. Even more concerning, such behavior has caused several small scale uprisings. Either we will slowly bleed our own lands dry or our subjects will rise up as one and slaughter every orc outside of the mountains.\n\nInstead of treating this land as a raiding ground, to be plundered at our convenience, we need to put down roots, learning from our subjects, the ways of life necessary to thrive in these lands"

 skewered_drake_reap_sow_title:0 "Reap what you Sow"
 skewered_drake_reap_sow_desc:0 "It appears our reforms are bearing fruit. Several orcish settlers have left their cavern homes behind to take over the many farms laid fallow in the wake of our conquests, learning to raise crops in the style of the native Bulwari farmers.\n\nNot only have yields markedly improved, some farmers have begun experimenting with different types of feed and herbs to find ones beneficial to the growth and muscle gain of our drakons. Already there have been several remarkable findings in that area, serving as a proof of concept.\n\nNow that the first test farms are a success, we need to expand this system in order to ensure a sustainable farming base for our growing realm."
 skewered_drake_reap_sow_tooltip:0 "Unlock the §YLuxurious Food§! option when §TTraining your Drakon§!"

 skewered_drake_one_swoop_title:0 "One Fell Swoop"
 skewered_drake_one_swoop_desc:0 "The peoples of Bulwar are weak beyond our imagination. The humans cower meekly in their cities and temples, or under the vassalage of elves, while their overlords themselves spend more time concocting petty schemes aimed at restoring some long forgotten empire, than actually ruling their domain.\n\nIndividually we could squash any of their nations with ease, however they are many, and a horde of cornered rats can still bring down a drakon.\n\nWe will bide our time and prepare. Once we've assembled the necessary drakon riders, our subjects are pacified, and supplies are assembled, we will ride down the ruined Golden Highway, much like we do in the dwaren roads, and smash their weakling armies. Our riders will not stop until they have hit the Western sea."

 skewered_drake_draken_keep_title:0 "The Draken Keep"
 skewered_drake_draken_keep_desc:0 "While our subjugation of the Bulwari advances rapidly, controlling such a huge amount of new land and subjects has proven quite the challenge. Compared to our previous conquests in the Harpy Hills and the Far Salahad, the flood plains of Bulwar are far more densely populated.\n\nWe need a central garrison from which we can rapidly deploy forces to quash any rebellions in the cradle. After studying the local geography, it seems we have found the perfect location, the ancient city of Bulwar. Aside from our control over it serving as a symbol of legitimacy, it is also a location of prime strategic value. Should we rebuild the old channel between the Suran and Buranun, we can rapidly transfer forces along those two rivers via river boat, allowing us to hit anywhere along their course.Keeping control of this channel will be essential to control Bulwar."

 skewered_drake_only_kneel_title:0 "You can only Kneel"
 skewered_drake_only_kneel_desc:0 "For those bordering our lands, there can only be two choices: Death or submission.\n\nThe Bulwari have learned this lesson and now either bow before our drakons or serve as feed for them. Now the time has come to look further afield to the decadent lands of Rahen to the east and the Kheteratan riverlands of the West.\n\nOnce we have squashed any remaining resistance amongst our subjects, we will ride forward and show these weaklings what a true master looks like."
 skewered_drake_only_kneel_tooltip:0 "\nOur §YTributary States§! will no longer be able to make §Yalliances§! or §Yguarantee§! nations that are §Ynot our subjects§!"

 skewered_drake_master_world_title:0 "Master of the World"
 skewered_drake_master_world_desc:0 "When our drakons roar the world trembles. From the Divenhal to the Gulf of Rahen all bow their heads before the lords of Drakonshan. However, there are yet more lands to conquer to the East and West, entire continents ripe for subjugation, and so we will continue. Our drakons will ride and continue to do so until all of Halann is under our rightful overlordship."


 ###4B###
 skewered_drake_flex_muscles_title:0 "Flex our Muscles"
 skewered_drake_flex_muscles_desc:0 "Despite our recent successes, the established powers of Bulwar view us as little more than savages; upstarts barely worth their notice.\n\nThe time has come to earn their respect by crushing them beneath our drakons' claws. Let them learn to fear our drakon riders."

 skewered_drake_heat_endurace_title:0 "Heat Endurance"
 skewered_drake_heat_endurace_desc:0 "While our drakons enjoy the constant sun and warmth of our new conquests, our warriors have proven less enthusiastic.\n\nThey keep complaining about the bright sunlight hurting their sensitive eyes, long accustomed to the limited light sources of our cavern homes, and the burns caused by armor pieces getting heated up by the unrelenting rays of the sun.\n\nOne of our generals has recently come up with a potential solution. In order to thrive in these new lands, we need to immerse ourselves in this new environment, as well as learn from those that have come before us. For this he has proposed the establishment of training camps in the dunes of the Far Salahad, allowing our soldiers to acclimatize to the new environment, as well as learn the ways of the natives in order to thrive in the dunes."

 skewered_drake_king_queen_title:0 "King takes Queen"
 skewered_drake_king_queen_desc:0 "Long have the harpy queens dominated the eponymous Harpy Hills from their throne roost of Heunthume, raiding the surrounding lands and competing with the Sun Elf kingdoms.\n\nWhile we have made significant inroads into the hills, the harpies remain far from broken, and storming every roast would cost us many warriors.\n\nInstead, we should install one of our harpy vassals as a loyal ruler on the Queen's Throne, allowing us to control the hills through her as a proxy."

 skewered_drake_wet_skewer_title:0 "Wet Skewer"
 skewered_drake_wet_skewer_desc:0 "The westernmost part of Bulwar forms a spearlike peninsula, jutting out from the lands of Brasan into the Divenhal Sea. Known as Drolas by the natives, our own warriors have taken to calling it by a different name; "The Wet Skewer".\n\nThe trade of the Divenhal Sea is of utmost importance for the prosperity of our new coastal possessions. We need a fleet in order to control the trade in the Eastern Divenhal and The Wet Skewer, with its controlling position, would make for the perfect naval base."

 skewered_drake_cats_drakon_title:0 "Of Cats and Drakons"
 skewered_drake_cats_drakon_desc:0 "Despite being the descendants of powerful warriors, the harimari of Rahen have grown weak and decadent. Their raj is not a realm of soldiers marching towards a unified goal, but instead of bureaucrats, either leading lazy lives of indulgence and vice, or scheming against one another for the pettiest of reasons.\n\nThe time has come to put this old and toothless tiger down for good. We will break the raj by tearing out its decadent heart and remind the harimari what a true warrior looks like. Under our dominance Rahen will know greatness once again."


 ###5B###
 skewered_drake_bark_bite_title:0 "All Bark no Bite"
 skewered_drake_bark_bite_desc:0 "The gnoll packs of Bulwar have long believed themselves the heirs of a great Age of Monsters. They played at building their little realms for a while, but when a true challenge came, they crumbled. We are the latest, greatest proof of that weakness. These gnolls may be able to frighten and intimidate the humans and elves, but we are made of much stronger stuff. Let us reveal them for the cowardly dogs they truly are."
 skewered_drake_bark_bite_tooltip:0 "No province in either the §YFar Salahad§! or §YFar Bulwar§! regions is owned by a §Ygnoll§! that is not our subject"

 skewered_drake_blood_sports_title:0 "Blood Sports"
 skewered_drake_blood_sports_desc:0 "Work and conquest alone make for a boring existence. We crave entertainment. With our hold over Bulwar tightening, we may have found the perfect solution. Deadly competitions of strength have long been common in orcish culture, and our drakons allow for more deadly and spectacular shows than ever before. Let us make a grand arena for such fights to take place in. We even have the perfect place to locate it. It's not like there's any sense in worshiping a dead god, anyway..."

 skewered_drake_plain_sight_title:0 "In Plain Sight"
 skewered_drake_plain_sight_desc:0 "The Forbidden Plains have long proven an inhospitable land for many races. Though the centaurs who call them home seem to be doing fine for themselves, they have also proven difficult to subjugate for their neighbors. Not us, however. We have started the process of bringing the Forbidden Plains to heel, and have even subjugated the local centaurs to help us in achieving that. While the Forbidden Plains are still vast and largely untamed, they now lay open before us."

 skewered_drake_welcome_traders_title:0 "Welcome Traders"
 skewered_drake_welcome_traders_desc:0 "Our expansion has not simply yielded us new territory and loot, it seems. For everything we now hold dominion over, traders from other realms have been attracted to our lands to do business, buying and selling goods to the benefit of our economy. But we can do better. By setting up a proper trade city at the Bulwari end of the Golden Highway, we can direct all these traders to a central hub where they may do business with us, and with each other."
 skewered_drake_welcome_traders_tooltip:0 "All parts of the §YBulwari Golden Highway§! are §Yrepaired§!"

 skewered_drake_return_roots_title:0 "Return to our Roots"
 skewered_drake_return_roots_desc:0 "Gor Vazumbrog has been a worthy capital for us, but with our vision turned outward, we have neglected to do much with it. Now seems the perfect time to change this. We are not well-equipped to deal with the dwarven infrastructure of this hold ourselves, but we have subjects who are more than capable. With enough of them on hand, and enough loot at our disposal, we can put them to work toward developing the true potential of our capital."

 flavor_skewered_drake.1.t:0 "Predators of the Dwarovar"
 flavor_skewered_drake.1.d:0 "For centuries the hold of Gor Vazumbrog guarded the Western flank of the Seghbandal alliance. There it stood as an everwatchful sentinel, the titanium dwarves and their golems seeing off any danger daring to encroach on their domain. However with their eyes fixed on the caverns and tunnels to the west, they were blind to the danger slumbering beneath their very feet.\n\nDuring the Dragonwake, a massive purple Dragon burst through the lower levels of the hold, breaking open the ancient vaults that had long been the charge of the titanium dwarves, and filling the lower levels of the hold with its poisonous breath. Unable to stop the titanic creature, the hold was abandoned, the lingering toxic gasses of the dragon's breath and the magic leaking from the broken vaults interacting to create a toxic hellscape only known as the Wound. But this was not the only thing left behind in the dragon's wake.\n\nNobody knows the true origins of the large, wingless lizards known as drakons. Maybe they are the children of the Hunter or some sort of arcane evolution, causing the mutation of the vermin living within the lower level of the hold by the dragon's toxic breath and the dangerous magic of the artifacts locked away in the vaults of Gor Vazumbrog. All that is known is that the largest and meanest of their kind can be found in Gor Vazumbrog. After our ancestors settled in the ruins we learned to live with, and eventually tame those creatures, our constant companions and namesake of the tribe. These powerful quadrupedal reptiles serve as mounts for the greatest of our warriors, their rending claws and snapping jaws making short work of any foolish enough to stand against us."

 flavor_skewered_drake.2.t:0 "Lord of Sun and Stone"
 flavor_skewered_drake.2.d:0 "Since the beginning of our history, we have terrorized the small folk of the Serpentspine. Under the banner of the Skewered Drake, we have turned that terror into dominion. Much of the old Dwarovar now lies within our grasp, and we do not intend on letting go. Yet there is more to our dominion than the Serpentspine, now. Our armies have begun their march into Bulwar, asserting our will and authority over the creatures that live beneath the sky instead of the mountains. The humans may look to their dead god or their precious elves for salvation, but both are powerless to stop our march. The Serpentspine and Bulwar both shall know a new master, and its name shall be Drakonshan."

 flavor_skewered_drake.3.d:0 "Unlike the war beasts used by other tribes, our drakons are more than mere beasts, to be driven into our enemies headless of casualties. They are our allies and partners, fighting together as a unit to protect our home. Over the centuries, a symbiosis has developed, with the orcs providing food and protection for eggs and hatchlings, while the drakons serve as war mounts, their natural strength and elemental breath making them unparalleled shock troops and linebreakers.\n\nWhile personal strength and prowess still matters, the bond with their drakon, as well as its strength and power, is as important for the standing of a warrior within the tribe. While our current chieftain Gashak is far from the physically most intimidating warrior, his mount, a red scaled beast with a violent temper, named Vrak, is the strongest mount seen in recent memory. Vrak's power, combined with Gashak's talent as a war leader, have made his rise to chieftain all but inevitable."

 flavor_skewered_drake.4.t:0 "The Bigger they are"
 flavor_skewered_drake.4.d:0 "The tunnels and caves of the Dwarovar hold many secrets, even to those that spend their whole lives within them.\n\nRecently, it seems that a new secret has been discovered. When passing through an encampment in the Misty Cave Trail, our patrol has come across the hut of an old hunter, who was currently in the process of tanning the hides of two wild drakons his hunting party had slain during their last hunting trip. However, these skins were unlike any drakon we had ever seen. Compared to the size of the skin, most of our drakons look like little more than adolescent runts. The only mount comparable in recent memory would be Gashnak's own mount Vrak. The patrol leader thankfully immediately recognized the potential of this discovery and brought both any remains of these massive drakons, and the hunters, in front of the chieftain.\n\nAfter confirming that these remains are indeed real and not just some other monstrosity, the hunters were interrogated.\n\nAccording to them, there is an entire subpopulation of these monstrous drakons living in the misty caves, growing strong and powerful by hunting the large eyeless fish in the large lakes in the deepest parts of the Misty Cave Trails."
 flavor_skewered_drake.4.a:0 "We need to secure these alpha drakons for our warriors."

 flavor_skewered_drake.5.d:0 "The peaceful trolls of Grizehud are truly an odd bunch. Most people would have roared in defiance and even started rebellions when being told that they would be tasked with mining duties, however the trolls happily accepted the terms of our gold mining operations, as long as we fulfilled two requests.\n\nThey requested that we entrusted the fort we had constructed to collect the mined gold over to them in order for them to protect "their friend's shinnies". And they have asked for some new goblin and dwarven "friends" to be brought to them to help them with the mining and start new lives in their domain.\n\nWhile the former request turned a few heads, it was eventually acquiesced to, as these trolls have proven to not have a deceitful bone in their body. As for the second request, all we can say is let them have their friends."

 flavor_skewered_drake.6.d:0 "Dinatoldir, the Piercer of Shadows, few weapons have a similar reputation in the history of Halann. Forged from the famed metals of the Precursor Elves, and carried by one of the greatest conquerors in the history of all of Halann.\n\nEven long after its shattering, it was proclaimed that whoever would reforge this weapon would unite Bulwar once again. Now it has been reforged, but not by some gallant elven princeling or brave human rebel. Instead it was reforged by an orc, a creature once considered a mere beast to be hunted by the people of Bulwar. And now it is those "beasts" that rule over them. Irony truly is almost as sweet as revenge.\n\nThe rule of elves, gnolls and men in Bulwar is over.\nThe time of the orc has come."
 flavor_skewered_drake.6.a:0 "I never liked this dainty elven tooth pick anyway."

 flavor_skewered_drake.7.t:0 "Dinatoldir Repurposed"
 flavor_skewered_drake.7.d:0 "The feast thrown by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been going surprisingly well. Diplomats from all over Bulwar have come to our surface capital in order to jostle for favor with their orcish overlords. Now that all of them have arrived, a gigantic feast has been hosted in our palace's main hall, combining the finest dishes from the Dwavorar and Bulwar. As the numerous courses are brought in by comely servers from all races of the realm, lively conversation fills the hall. Many of the guests have heard rumors that the main course of tonight's feast will forever be remembered throughout Bulwar. Our guests compete with each other to come up with the most elaborate dishes imaginable. Some say it will be real dragon steak garnished with werewolf ears, others claim there would be rock omelets with a filling of sphinx meat slowly cooked with a dash of wyvern venom.\n\nThey all grow silent as the main course is brought into the hall and set down before [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Many of the humans and elves have grown pale as snow. There is a distinct clattering somewhere in the back, maybe one of the guests has fainted and taken their cutlery with them.\n\nOn the royal table sits a giant, roasted pheasant, refeathered in vermillion and gold in order to resemble a phoenix. However what truly draws everyone's eyes is the skewer used in the preparation of the dish. Dinatoldir, once wielded by the liberator of Bulwar, now drips with fat and sauce. As the spear is slammed on the table, it causes the skewered pheasant on it to glow, making it resemble even more, the noble phoenix, symbol of Jaher's empire.\nThe humiliation of his legacy is complete."
 flavor_skewered_drake.7.a:0 "I hope they enjoyed the show."

 flavor_skewered_drake.8.t:0 "More than a Chieftain"
 flavor_skewered_drake.8.d:0 "In ages past we were but one tribe out of many, a small brotherhood where everyone knew everyone and our leader's face was as well known to each member of their warband as their own mother's.\n\nAs we look out over the bustling city of Azka-Sur, we realize how much has changed. After the initial show of our conquest, the city has recovered well. The capital of our fledgling surface realm houses thousands of people from many different races, of whom only the highest officials know their ruler's face. Our realm changed a lot from the close knit group of old.\n\nMaybe the time has come to change ourselves a bit as well. The people of Bulwar do not follow mere chieftains; they are used to following Akals and Phoenix Kings. The time has come to take a royal title of our own; one that reflects our power and right to rule over these lands."
 flavor_skewered_drake.8.a:0 "Drakelord [Root.Monarch.GetName], I like the sound of that."

 flavor_skewered_drake.9.t:0 "Lord of Bulwar"
 flavor_skewered_drake.9.d:0 "The ancient city of Bulwar, lying at the center of the Suran plain, has long been the beating heart of the entire region. Through its great channel, goods have long been transferred between the mighty rivers Suran and Buranun, the city's merchants taking a handsome cut for their trouble.\n\nNot much has changed under the rule of Sun Elves or Gnolls, each overlord realizing it was better to leave the golden goose undisturbed aside from occasionally collecting the eggs.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Drakonshan is a different kind of ruler. After taking the ancient city, we have set to transform it into a new central administrative and military center for the region. Large blocks have been leveled to make space for drake pens and a new citadel, already colloquially known as the Draken Keep, is being raised next to the city's harbor. The walls are being rebuilt by our best military engineers, and the great channel is being widened and deepened in order to accommodate the heavy transport barges necessary for transporting our drakons along the river systems of Bulwar.\nThe rivers of Bulwar have become our spider net, while we control it all from our citadel at its center. Any rebellion against our rule of Bulwar will be hopeless."
 flavor_skewered_drake.9.a:0 "Bulwar is no more, in its place rises Urdak."

 flavor_skewered_drake.10.t:0 "Skewer of the World"
 flavor_skewered_drake.10.d:0 "When Dookanson was slain at Castonath, the surface races sighed in relief, thinking that orckind was shattered for good. Little did they know that Dookanson's horde was merely a precursor of what was to come.\n\nWe succeeded where he failed, our drakon riders shattering everyone that would come to stand against them, from dwarven shield walls and elven legions, to the rabble the Raheni consider soldiers. Now they all bow their heads when one of our drake riders passes by them.\n\nYet we are not without mercy. Instead of just plundering their lands and putting their cities to the torch, we have created a strong and unified state, learning and innovating from our predecessors to keep our land safe and stable, allowing trade to flows unimpeded under the watchful eyes of our garrisons and drakon mounted caravan wardens.\n\nWe have taken the shattered pieces of Bulwar and reforged them with the flame breath of our drakons.\n\nHowever our work remains unfinished. Even now our scouts are scouting along the remnants of the Golden Highway, mapping the lands beyond our domain for conquest. There are still many lands that have yet to accept our overlordship, but it is just a matter of time. Like a barbed skewer, we do not let go once we have struck true, and this particular skewer has buried itself right into the heart of Halann."

 flavor_skewered_drake.11.d:0 "In the rugged lands of the Harpy Hills, for times immemorial, the most dangerous predators have been those of the sky.\n\nFrom their throne city, the Harpy Queendoms long dominated the cliffs and high lands of this region, styling themselves in the tradition of harpy queendoms going back millenia in this region. So there they sat, in their mountain roosts, long thought to be unconquerable by the weakling humans and elves around them. That was however before we emerged from our cavern homes. For drakons trained to run along cavern ceilings, climbing up the sheer mountain sides that made the harpy roosts unassailable to others, proved a trivial challenge.\n\nPutting these roosts to the torch would be a waste of resources. The harpies have ruled over these lands for centuries and know it and its people. Instead of pillaging their homes, it is wiser to make them subservient to us.\n\nHowever, this submission needs to be more than just performative. We will turn their ancient throne city into a symbol of their servitude."
 flavor_skewered_drake.11.a:0 "This place is in dire need of some remodeling."

 flavor_skewered_drake.12.t:0 "Luster Lost"
 flavor_skewered_drake.12.d:0 "Once, the Golden Palace of Dhenijansar was the beating heart of a proud warrior kingdom, but like the realm it governed over the ages, it has become weak and decadent; the smell of the sweat of drilling soldiers and the constant hammering of the forges, replaced with the sickly sweet odor of perfume, and the useless prattle of scheming bureaucrats.\n\nHowever, under a new leadership, the palace is slowly returning to what it was supposed to be. Where once docile parade elephants were kept, now new drakon stables are prepared. \n\nThe halls, where endless hordes of nobles and bureaucrats were once scheming against one another, now echoes with ringing clashes of metal and the discussion of war plans. Pleasure gardens are turned into target ranges, and the once decorative walls are turned into a fortress, capable of withstanding the fiercest of barrages.\n\nAnd at the center, where the weak lotus throne once sat on a raised dais, this dais has been replaced with a huge drakon statue of blackened iron, it's eyes made from the two largest emeralds from the Raj's crown jewels.\n\nOur Raheni subjects may grumble that the luster of this palace has been lost, but why would the drakon concern itself with the opinion of sheep?\nThe golden decorations have been ripped off and the steel underneath has been revealed."

Every threat we make shall not simply be hollow words. We shall carry them out, detail to excruciating detail, so that our enemies know the gravity our words carry. Such a reputation will ensure our enemies tread carefully and think twice when we issue harsh words. After all, it is not the hollow posturing of a gnoll, but the grim warning of an orc.

Both mounted and unmounted drakons shall compete in brutal bloodsports, all for our entertainment.

 flavor_skewered_drake.100.d:0 "In order for a warmount to grow large and strong enough to carry a rider quickly, supplying them with a steady supply of food is essential. However, regarding the kind and quality of food provided, different opinions persist among drakon trainers and riders.\n\nSome believe that it is best to feed their hatchling basic war rations along with allowing them to hunt for themselves, believing that while the drakon will grow slower, they will be earlier accustomed to the harsh realities of an army on the march, thereby becoming tougher and more easily supplied when out on campaign.\n\nOthers think that the best approach is a well balanced diet, giving the drakon everything to grow strong at a healthy rate, as well as develop an even temper.\n\nMany young and ambitious warriors have come to spend exorbitant sums on magically enhanced feed, containing herbs and other supposedly magical components, believed to vastly accelerate drakon growth and muscle gain. While beasts fed with this special feed indeed grow faster and larger than their brethren, they also seem to exhibit lower intelligence, alongside a more violent and greedy temperament."

 flavor_skewered_drake.101.t:0 "How to train your Drakon"
 flavor_skewered_drake.101.d:0 "With the hatchling having grown into a young drakon, the time has come to start its formal training. While all hatchlings will undergo the same basic training, honing their strength, speed, battle prowess, and tracking abilities, the training of hatchlings usually places the focus on certain abilities in order to best complement the skills of their riders.\n\nOutriders and messengers especially praise endurance in their mounts, allowing them to cover many miles of cavern or road in a single day.\n\nThe guardians of our cavern camps instead prefer a focus on strength, allowing their mounts to fully explore all angles in cavern battles by skittering up cavern walls and along cavern ceilings.\n\nMeanwhile, warriors prefer the training to focus on the battle prowess of their mounts, spending hours strengthening their mounts' jaws, forelimbs, and breath weapon, knowing that in the end, their life and the life of their mounts depend on them being the more powerful."

 flavor_skewered_drake.102.d:0 "With the drakon now large enough to be ridden, the time has come for our chieftain to get on the saddle and learn how to control and command their mount in battle. During this time period, it is of utmost importance to build up rapport between rider and mount, as well as decide what style of combat works best for the pair.\n\nFor scouts and commanders, the fighting prowess of their mount is of secondary importance compared to its mobility, allowing them to get to vantage points from where they can overlook the battlefield or quickly rush to hard pressed units, bolstering their courage.\n\nSkirmishers instead utilize the mobility of their mounts to just stay out of range of the enemy, peppering them with ranged weapons, bleeding entire units slowly and methodically.\n\nOur drakon chargers instead prefer to act as shock troops, shattering enemy formations with lance, claw, and elemental breath.\n\nOther pairs prefer the thick of melee instead, laying into our enemies with cleaver, tooth, and claw."

 flavor_skewered_drake.103.d:0 "While most others mistreat their mounts, inflicting pain through whips and spurs, no true member of our tribe would think of treating their mount in such a way. Our drakons are our allies; partners as close as bloodkin. We owe much to them, and we should show our appreciation for the services they render. This is also of prime importance when building up the bond of a mount and a new rider.\n\nUnlike the docile horses and other mounts used by the surfacers, our drakons are powerful predators that can as easily rip off a warrior's arm, as a child can rip a wing off a fly. As such, they do not tolerate being mistreated. Many young warriors have forgotten to show their mounts the necessary respect and paid for it with their lives.\n\nThe way we show our appreciation is up to us though. More reserved riders prefer to show their mounts that they appreciate them through excellent care and small gestures, such as a quick pet.\n\nMore boisterous riders instead prefer being more showy with their affections, often going so far as to embrace their mounts after prolonged absence.\n\nMany of the younger warriors tend to spend much of their free time roughhousing and playing with their drakons; not only building a close connection with their mount, but also gaining a new appreciation for both their power, as well as their ability to be gentle with their smaller orcish friends."
 flavor_skewered_drake.103.a:0 "We should act distinguished. Small gestures are enough."

Renowned in our subject territories, he was unheard of by our Drakon Riders yet they bowed deeply and offered their service to Drakonshan. Presenting their list of accomplishments and feats, they have felt that aiding the nation directly would be more suitable for their skill, to strengthen the forces of Drakonshan with strategies not used by our orcs before. It seems that not only the masses have something to gain from this day, but also our commanding officers."

While its tiered setup has largely remained intact, there have been some changes at the top of the mountain city.\n\nThe Queen's Throne, long mounted on the highest tower of the city, has been moved into the largest drill hall of the former military district of the third tier. Meanwhile the fourth tier, now renamed to drakon's roost, has been turned into a drakeclaw orc fortress overlooking the mountain city, it's garrison ready to squash the slightest hint of rebellion should it arise."

 golden_palace_skewered_drake_desc:0 "--------------\nDuring the Second Harimaraj, the Golden Palace was a place of sophistication and beauty. However, its performative nature was ill suited for the purposes the new orcish occupants had in mind. They have transformed the palace into a fortress, the beating heart of their occupation of the Rahen peninsula.\n\nThe only remnant of the past splendor of this place is the original lotus throne, unoccupied unless the Drakelord resides in Bagordak. However it's original dais has been replaced with a huge drakon, forged from pure iron, its menacing eyes carved from two giant emeralds."
