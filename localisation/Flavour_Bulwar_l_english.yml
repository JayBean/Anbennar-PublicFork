 bulwar_flavour.1.d:0 "The lands that have been occupied by the gnolls for so long are now no longer in their control, which allows for the return of the Surani people to the land they fled from so long ago. Groups of them have been spotted trying to return 'home'. This has caused some stir. Should we allow them to return to their lands?"
 bulwar_flavour.1.a:0 "Welcome them back!"

 bulwar_flavour.2.t:0 "An Offer of Help"
 bulwar_flavour.2.d:0 "An elven warrior has appeared in our court. He calls himself by the name of Kamnaril of the Sands. Supposedly he claims to be a Jaddari officer, the son of a veteran of Jaher's conquests. He speaks of a different take our relationship to Surakel. While the Sun Elves would have us believe that only they can fulfill the duties of the deceased god, Kamnaril speaks of how the Jaddari see that all who are faithful can take the burden of Surakel. He proposes a world wherein we are no longer subservient to the sun elves."

 bulwar_flavour.3.t:0 "A Faith of Tolerance?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.da:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country. They speak of a new religion, one that promotes tolerance of all races. This 'Jadd' they speak of has them organise in their own communes and do work in the name of their sun god. They even have started preaching on the street to anyone who would listen, saying that the darkness in their hearts must be banished and that all are welcome within the light of 'Surael'. More and more are starting to listen to them. Can we really let this continue?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.db:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country, speaking heresy. They claim that Surael has not really entrusted the Sun Elves with his duties and that instead his duties fall to everyone who follows his light. They are encouraging the peasants to take more and more power into their own hands. This is disturbing the public order! Can we really let this continue?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.a:0 "Let them do what they want."

Several gifts have been sent and members of those groups have been invited to public gatherings. May the events there set an example to all of us."
 bulwar_flavour.4.a:0 "We welcome the faithful!"
 bulwar_flavour.5.t:0 "Minority Groups in [Root.GetName] Outmaneuvered"
 bulwar_flavour.5.d:0 "While we try to live harmoniously with other races, politics and ambition brings out the worst in people. A political rivalry in [Root.GetName] has spiraled out of control to the point where one sought to use the other's racial heritage against them, starting a slander campaign against all members of his kind. This started locally but it is likely to affect the entire country!"

 bulwar_flavour.6.t:0 "A Foreign Commander"
 bulwar_flavour.6.d:0 "We have been approached by an elf in foreign dress. His tanned skin and pale hair go combined with garb that say he is one of the Jaddari, remnants of Jaher's legions that became desert warriors and turned towards a strange faith. Shall we take him on as our commander? He might be a great help in our wars."

The people will dance in the street and sacrifices of bread and water will be offered up to his Radiance. All will work towards the great execution of this feast. How shall we deliver our contribution?"

 bulwar_flavour.9.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetName] have been misguided in their faith. A group of angry zealots have taken it upon themselves to start several attacks on the local population to punish them for the darkness in their hearts. There are reports of torture, lynching and destruction of property. The violence seems to be getting even further out of hand. What do we do?"

 bulwar_flavour.10.t:0 "The People of [target_province.GetName] See the Light!"
 bulwar_flavour.10.d:0 "The knowledge that their people will be accepted in the country does favours for their acceptance of the government. The people in [target_province.GetName] have seen the treatment of their brethren within the Jadd and accepted Surael's light. They are visiting local temples and starting to learn their daily prayers and traditions. They are well on their way to becoming good propagators of the principles of the Jadd."

 bulwar_flavour.11.d:0 "The Jadd missionaries have managed to sway the locals in [target_province.GetName] to their religion. Already new local communities are forming around the organisation of the Jadd faith. Among them are pockets of zealous warriors only all to eager to serve their faith in whatever way their leaders ask of them. If we allow this to go on they might create great instability in the country!"

Tell me, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], have the people truly seen the light and should we follow in their conversion, or are harsher measures necessary?"

 #Rebuilding the Ekluzagnu

 rebuild_the_stone_palace_desc:0 "Ekluzagnu, the Stone Palace, lies in ruins. The prestigious, ornate fortress, the center of states that have come and gone for millennia has long served as a symbol of dominance over the Šad Sur. Were we to revitalize the wonder, it would create a trophy that proves our legitimacy, and solidify our grasp on the region."
 bulwar_flavour.26.t:0 "Rebuilding the Ekluzagnu"
 bulwar_flavour.26.d:0 "A quick loop of the mountain on horseback makes clear the nature of the fortress, of all that need be done. The swift bend of the Panuzagnu river cuts beneath the sheer cliff at the mountain's end, the old gate watchful in its long vigil over cloud-kissed peaks of the mountains beyond. The depths of the first citadel remain surprisingly well preserved, still decorated with murals boasting the feats of ancient Bulwari kings, even if they've been stripped of their valuable ornaments. The reason for the fortress's abandonment, however, lies clear in the scattered bones, the potsherds, the broken stones beyond the toppled gates that litter Galuibar -- the Demonscar.\n\nA rift melted through what seems a half a league of solid mountain, by Xhazobine's fury, the blackened gulch has long supplanted the old gate. With the sun shining bright down through the open wound in the stone above, the scene is laid bare. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands amidst the vast rift, gazing down through a scar that had healed into a bustling way lined with dwellings, storefronts, temples, all the long-abandoned cogs that set a city turning. The scars of war seem fresh, even after centuries from arrows still embed in half-rotted posts, to stagnant pools of water beneath shattered aqueducts. The past weighs heavy, amidst the scattered stones of a gatehouse so laden with scars that it seemed to have been rebuilt a hundred times over. If the Ekluzagnu had fallen before, stripped from the Bulwari who first set chisel to stone, from Zehia, shattered by Xhazobine, from the Castanites, the folk of the Šad Sur... How can [Root.Monarch.GetName] hope to set the walls anew, see that their stones never crumble, as so many before?\n\nYet, the crossroad stands at a crossroads. Shall we exploit this progress to turn it to an impenetrable fortress, or stand upon the shoulders of this splendid progress to make it a palace, a monument to our glory?"

 bulwar_flavour.27.da:0 "While no city is built in a day, a mere decade seems as the blink of an eye, for how far we have come. Standing in the shattered ruin of the Galuibar gate a decade past, it seemed a hopeless task to restore a long-abandoned city crawling with squatters and monsters. And yet, the black gate stands tall. With its façade hewn from the black stone of the Demonscar, the imposing wall of stone stands in defiance of those who would consign this grand city to history. Even an experimental shot from one of our most powerful canons failed to leave an obvious proofmark in that stone gate. It looms over the sands, deep and dark as the void between the stars. Adorned in marble with fierce visages of snarling gnolls, the vigilant helms of the Bulwari, the Castanites, the Ekluzagnu displays the united will of all who have dwelt within its walls, all who ever shall, that it has stood proud two thousand years, and shall stand two thousand more.\n\nDownriver, the modest city of Suruzagnu had largely dominated the region, but the reconstruction of the Ekluzagnu has outpaced it in glory. Just as it flourished, so too blooms the 'little stone' of the stone palace. While the traders, diplomats, and sightseers are most often drawn to the now-bustling Galuibar's stone-hewn markets, the whole region grows prosperous, into an oasis in the overland route from Bulwar through the Salahad. The ancient dwellings, inhabited on and off for a thousand years now play host to shops that hawk exotic goods from the four corners of Halann, their patios draped in tapestries of elven silk that shield the market from the beating sun of the great rift above. The cries of exotic beasts, the smell of a thousand cuisines welcome weary travelers."

Standing in the shattered ruin of the Galuibar gate a decade past, it seemed a hopeless task to restore a long-abandoned city crawling with squatters and monsters. And yet, Ekluzagnu has bloomed into an oasis in every sense. An ancient spiral pipework that delves down to some hidden enclave at the river still faithfully pipes water through the citadel even after what must have been a thousand and odd years. It feeds a system of pipelike flows tucked away in the eaves of the caverns, which themselves feed crystal-clear pools of water scattered through the labyrinthine twists of the hand-hewn city. The few shafts of sunlight that peek in past the shattered crest of the mountain foster bountiful gardens, planters and hanging pots filled with topsoil from the fertile land downstream. This little Bulwar of the sands shines with ample splendor to suit an empire.\n\nDownriver, the modest city of Suruzagnu had largely dominated the region, but the reconstruction of the Ekluzagnu has outpaced it in glory.

It was in this method that she slew the akal of Zanšap, who had the gall to claim the Šad Sur as his own homeland and yet in the end found himself victim to its labyrinthine passes.\n\n Galvanized by this victory, she would soon force the remaining mountain packs to submit to her ambitions and would go on to earn the epithet 'Cleaver-of-Realms' by subjugating the city of Bulwar after besting Karodir I Varamzuir in magical combat."

 bulwar_flavour.31.d:0 "For centuries, the Zanšapi of the Sad Sur mountains have celebrated the Umaslu, the Day of the Sheep, on the winter solstice. Named after the shadow cast by the local mountains, which very much resembles such a creature, it is celebrated by a strict adherence to all the Sun Cult's tenets and prayers to give Surael strength to bring back longer days (along with big plate of spiced ovine meat).\n\nRecently, with the influx of visitors to the restored Ekluzagnu, people from across Bulwar have learned of the tradition. Towns across the land have started to host their own versions of the festival, borrowing the Zanšapi name and rituals (even if no mountains cast any animal-shaped shadows in their vicinity). The herders, hearing about this, have mostly reacted with amusement, along with delight at this new-found market for their livestock. Now that word has reached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must decide [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reaction as well: should [Root.GetName] embrace this new tradition, with a state-sponsored feast at the next solstice, or should we leave it the domain of the peasants?"

That said, it must have happened at some point in the past few decades, for that is the only possibly provenance of today's shocking scene in [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nThe treasury was undergoing a careful inventory, when suddenly it rang with a series of loud explosions. Apparently, one of the guards had put his tea down on a dusty mahogany table that languished amidst other never-used gifts — and that act must have triggered some long-forgotten contingency spell. The table was instantly transmuted into a collection of spell tablets, which date at least to the Age of God-Kings.\n\nThe mage guild is clamoring for access to these, saying it will revolutionize their craft. But the guard claims to have been imbued with some of the same magic that revealed them, and as long as we are willing to provide him with copious tea, he will be able to master their knowledge in a way none other could.

Using strategic locations such as the port city of Edešukuru, their homelands in Shimlardu, and the safety of the walls of Azka-sur, these Mašnsih prospered as guides for the trade caravans who preferred to brave the Salahad.\n\nWith our newfound control over these key cities, the Szal-Mehran are finding more and more willing customers who relish the opportunity to travel through a route under the jurisdiction of a single country, no longer fearing that patrols from differing states may impose a new tariff on their goods.

The learned men do emphasize that there must be a good reason to protect this place if the whole of the Sihrušam completely support any and all actions of the szal-Ardeth.\n\nThe skeptical in our court were quick to denounce the words of these wise men as silly fairy tales and ask [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to stand against the tribals who threaten the people of [Root.Country.GetName]."

The nomadic tribe's grudge against the gnolls led to them hunting gnoll bands ever since they were displaced, developing a set of brilliant tactics to break their organization and gain victory in the majority of conflicts between them. Their recruits were composed of former slaves who shared their deep hatred for the slavers, and they received support from the Sihrušam, or Sand Banner, the confederation of Mašnsih tribes.\n\nThough they are followers of the Jadd, which believes in the Enlightenment of monstrous races, their deep-seated hatred for gnollkind makes them care little for if a gnoll is Enlightened or not. The tribe has recently undertaken a deadly incursion against gnollish settlements near the oasis, killing indiscriminately and burning down everything in sight. The gnolls are now trying to recover from the blow, rebuilding their homes and preparing for future raids."

 bulwar_flavour.110.d:0 "Legends say that hidden within the Salahad desert is an ancient city from the time of the God-Kings: Ulmišbar. Founded by God-King Ulmiš and his bound genies along with his two sons and a thousand servants, the God-King wished to escape the constant intrigue and war of the rest of the God-Kings in Bulwar. He thus fled east, to the inhospitable Salahad desert, where he wished a great city of marble to be built and lived there in peace. After his death, his two sons fought over who would rule the city and take his immense wealth. It is said that during this brothers' war the Salahad desert then came to life and devoured the city whole.\n\nWith the unification of Bulwar, war and intrigue are less and less on people's minds, and adventurous spirits reign. There are more and more rumors circulating concerning the location of the city, which has garnered interest both from rich merchants, nobles and daring adventurers. Our advisors tell [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that we should organize an expedition to uncover the secrets hidden deep within the desert before someone else does.\n\nOne of the Mašnsih tribes of the Salahad, the szal-Fazil, are said to live among these ruins, guarding the ancient magical knowledge within and sharing it only with a spare few. They are devoted worshippers of Surakel, not recognizing Jaher as His reincarnation or Jaddar as His Herald and Prophet."

Though they are reticent to let the expedition in, they do say that they will not oppose the party with force of arms.\n\nWithin the great hill of sand is a huge depression where the szal-Fazil settled, the Buried Palace or Ekluqebru. Tents, stony homes and various buildings of human craft litter the area and many nomads are watching the expedition with clear suspicion. As the party heads deeper into this makeshift village, they notice quite a few learned men and women studying the magical craft with ancient relics and reactives and reagents that even the accompanying magi know of only due to their extensive research of exotic magical components.\n\nAs the expedition stops by an unearthed well whose supply of water is apparently unending, they are able to gather from the locals that Ulmišbar has three points of great interest that no one has yet been able to properly dig up and peer into: The Ulmiš palace, from which the God-King reigned; A great library holding untold amounts of knowledge from ancient Bulwar; And the temple of a forgotten God of old Bulwar."

Though they are reticent to let the expedition in, they do say that they will not oppose the party with force of arms.\n\nThe expedition quickly realizes that the szal-Fazil host plenty of mages. It seems they have harbored human mages who sought exile from the Empire to pursue arcane knowledge, going against the law of the Phoenix. They have developed their magical capabilities beyond the levels considered safe for the human mind. It seems there is a prominent reason as to why the mages gather here, and also as to how they were able to develop their skills so greatly in the middle of a desert: The artifacts and treasures that Ulmišbar provides them, they are imbued with knowledge of ancient Bulwar.\n\nOur armed men and archeologists have been retrieving these artifacts as the humans struggled to hide them to no avail. The few who dared defend their possessions paid dearly for their sacrilege. Soon a great pile of reagents, reactives, old relics and ancient tomes is formed in the middle of the town. The nomads, saddened, plead with you to not destroy them."

At a certain point, each member seems to spin a different tale, but all agree on the fact that the earth shook and an ominous, earpiercing roar was heard far in the distance.\n\nOur brave explorers say that they swiftly fled from the rooms they excavated and found themselves amidst a huge sandstorm, some say that they saw the shadow of a gigantic creature moving among the sands. After gathering as many artifacts as they could, the crew fled from Ulmišbar along with the panicked szal-Fazil. They heard a final bellow and the earth shook once more and when they looked back, the silhouette of Ulmišbar was gone, buried once more into the depths of the Salahad.\n\nThe crestfallen szal-Fazil tribe accompanied the expedition until they reached Saranza, their settlement which was once only used as a place to meet foreigners, now their permanent home, and stopped there while our party went on its way with the artifacts they took."
