 bulwar_flavour.1.d:0 "The lands that have been occupied by the gnolls for so long are now no longer in their control, which allows for the return of the Surani people to the land they fled from so long ago. Groups of them have been spotted trying to return 'home'. This has caused some stir. Should we allow them to return to their lands?"
 bulwar_flavour.1.a:0 "Welcome them back!"
 bulwar_flavour.1.b:0 "It will cause too much of a ruckus."
 bulwar_flavour.2.t:0 "An Offer of Help"
 bulwar_flavour.2.d:0 "An elven warrior has appeared in our court. He calls himself by the name of Camnaril of the Sands. Supposedly he claims to be a Jaddari officer, the son of a veteran of Jaher's conquests. He speaks of a different take our relationship to Surakel. While the Sun Elves would have us believe that only they can fulfill the duties of the deceased god, Camnaril speaks of how the Jaddari see that all who are faithful can take the burden of Surakel. He proposes a world wherein we are no longer subservient to the sun elves."
 bulwar_flavour.2.a:0 "A Jaddari officer huh? He should stay and tell us more!"
 bulwar_flavour.2.b:0 "Interesting. See him on his way, we have no need of this heretic."
 bulwar_flavour.3.t:0 "A Faith of Tolerance?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.da:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country. They speak of a new religion, one that promotes tolerance of all races. This 'Jadd' they speak of has them organise in their own communes and do work in the name of their sun god. They even have started preaching on the street to anyone who would listen, saying that the darkness in their hearts must be banished and that all are welcome within the light of 'Surael'. More and more are starting to listen to them. Can we really let this continue?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.db:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country, speaking heresy. They claim that Surael has not really entrusted the Sun Elves with his duties and that instead his duties fall to everyone who follows his light. They are encouraging the peasants to take more and more power into their own hands. This is disturbing the public order! Can we really let this continue?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.a:0 "Let them do what they want."
 bulwar_flavour.3.b:0 "Absolutely not! See them off!"

 bulwar_flavour.4.d:0 "The minorities in [Root.GetName] have long lived under less than ideal circumstances. However with convictions of the Jadd comes a new era. Several gifts have been sent and members of those groups have been invited to public gatherings. May the events there set an example to all of us."
 bulwar_flavour.4.a:0 "We welcome the faithful!"
 bulwar_flavour.5.t:0 "Minority Groups in [Root.GetName] Outmaneuvered"
 bulwar_flavour.5.d:0 "While we try to live harmoneously with other races, politics and ambition brings out the worst in people. A political rivalry in [Root.GetName] has spiraled out of control to the point where one sought to use the other's racial heritage against them, starting a slander campaign against all members of his kind. This started locally but it is likely to affect the entire country!"

 bulwar_flavour.5.b:0 "We won't let that happen!"
 bulwar_flavour.6.t:0 "A Foreign Commander"
 bulwar_flavour.6.d:0 "We have been approached by an elf in foreign dress. His tanned skin and pale hair go combined with garb that say he is one of the Jaddari, remnants of Jaher's legions that became beduoin warriors and turned towards a strange faith. Shall we take him on as our commander? He might be a great help in our wars."
 bulwar_flavour.6.a:0 "He could be useful, welcome him in."
 bulwar_flavour.6.b:0 "Unnecessary."
 bulwar_flavour.7.t:0 "A Festival of Surael of the Jadd"
 bulwar_flavour.7.d:0 "It is time, O [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: the weather is perfect, the water is clear, the sun is bright. A festival in the honour of our glorious god will be held. The people will dance in the street and sacrifices of bread and water will be offered up to his Radiance. All will work towards the great execution of this feast. How shall we deliver our contribution?"

[Root.Monarch.GetName] finally also attended one of his ralleys and found [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] greatly inspired. The truth is clear: Surael is behind us fully and we strike with his favour!"

 bulwar_flavour.9.t:0 "Violence against Religious Minorities in [Root.GetName]"
 bulwar_flavour.9.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetName] have been misguided in their faith. A group of angry zealots have taken it upon themselves to start several attacks on the local population to punish them for the darkness in their hearts. There are reports of torture, lynching and destruction of property. The violence seems to be getting even further out of hand. What do we do?"
 bulwar_flavour.9.a:0 "Let the faithless burn!"
 bulwar_flavour.9.b:0 "Stop this chaos immediately!"
 bulwar_flavour.10.t:0 "The People of [Root.GetName] See the Light!"
 bulwar_flavour.10.d:0 "The knowledge that their people will be accepted in the country does favours for their acceptance of the government. The people in [Root.GetName] have seen the treatment of their bretheren within the Jadd and accepted Surael's light. They are visiting local temples and starting to learn their daily prayers and traditions. They are well on their way to becoming good propagators of the pricinciples of the Jadd."
 bulwar_flavour.10.a:0 "Welcome to the arms of truth!"
 bulwar_flavour.11.t:0 "The People of [Root.GetName] embrace the Jadd"
 bulwar_flavour.11.d:0 "The Jadd missionaries have managed to sway the locals in [Root.GetName] to their religion. Already new local communities are forming around the organisation of the Jadd faith. Among them are pockets of zealous warriors only all to eager to serve their faith in whatever way their leaders ask of them. If we allow this to go on they might create great instability in the country!"
 bulwar_flavour.11.a:0 "That's not what I wanted! Kick them out!"

 bulwar_flavour.11.c:0 "They're really onto something!"
 bulwar_flavour.12.t:0 "The People's Faith"
 bulwar_flavour.12.d:0 "It was a fateful decision to let that group of Jadd missionaries into our borders and to preach their faith. The people in our land now seem to all adhere to this new faith. Tell me, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], have the people truly seen the light and should we follow in their conversion, or are harsher measures necessary?"
 bulwar_flavour.12.a:0 "Let us embrace the Light of the Jadd"

 #Rebuilding the Ekluzagnu

The prestigious, ornate fortress, the center of states that have come and gone for millennia has long served as a symbol of dominance over the Šad Sur. Were we to revitalize the wonder, it would create a trophy that proves our legitimacy, and solidify our grasp on the region."
 bulwar_flavour.26.t:0 "Rebuilding the Ekluzagnu"
 bulwar_flavour.26.d:0 "A quick loop of the mountain on horseback makes clear the nature of the fortress, of all that need be done. The swift bend of the Panuzagnu river cuts beneath the sheer cliff at the mountain's end, the old gate watchful in its long vigil over cloud-kissed peaks of the mountains beyond. The depths of the first citadel remain surprisingly well preserved, still decorated with murals boasting the feats of ancient Bulwari kings, even if they've been stripped of their valuable ornaments. The reason for the fortress' abandonment, however, lies clear in the scattered bones, the potsherds, the broken stones beyond the toppled gates that litter Galuibar, the Demonscar...\n\nA rift melted through what seems a half a league of solid mountain, by Xhazobine's fury, the blackened gulch has long supplanted the old gate. With the sun shining bright down through the open wound in the stone above, the scene is laid bare. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands amidst the vast rift, gazing down through a scar that had healed into a bustling way lined with dwellings, storefronts, temples, all the long-abandoned cogs that set a city turning. The scars of war seem fresh, even after centuries from arrows still embed in half-rotted posts, to stagnant pools of water beneath shattered aqueducts. The past weighs heavy, amidst the scattered stones of a gatehouse so laden with scars that it seemed to have been rebuilt a hundred times over. If the Ekluzagnu had fallen before, stripped from the Bulwari who first set chisel to stone, from Zehia, shattered by Xhazobine, from the Castanites, the folk of the Šad Sur... How can [Root.Monarch.GetName] hope to set the walls anew, see that their stones never crumble, as so many before?\n\nYet, the crossroad stands at a crossroads. Shall we exploit this progress to turn it to an impenetrable fortress, or stand upon the shoulders of this splendid progress to make it a palace, a monument to our glory?"

 bulwar_flavour.27.da:0 "While no city is built in a day, a mere decade seems as the blink of an eye, for how far we have come. Standing in the shattered ruin of the Galuibar gate a decade past, it seemed a hopeless task to restore a long-abandoned city crawling with squatters and monsters. And yet, the black gate stands tall. With its façade hewn from the black stone of the Demonscar, the imposing wall of stone stands in defiance of those who would consign this grand city to history. Even an experimental shot from one of our most powerful canons failed to leave an obvious proofmark in that stone gate. It looms over the sands, deep and dark as the void between the stars. Adorned in marble with fierce visages of snarling gnolls, the vigilant helms of the Bulwari, the Castanites, the Ekluzagnu displays the united will of all who have dwelt within its walls, all who ever shall, that it has stood proud two thousand years, and shall stand two thousand more.\n\nDownriver, the modest city of Suruzagnu had largely dominated the region, but the reconstruction of the Ekluzagnu has outpaced it in glory. Just as it flourished, so too blooms the 'little stone' of the stone palace. While the traders, diplomats, and sightseers are most often drawn to the now-bustling Galuibar's stone-hewn markets, the whole region grows prosperous, into an oasis in the overland route from Bulwar through the Salahad. The ancient dwellings, inhabited on and off for a thousand years now play host to shops that hawk exotic goods from the four corners of Halann, their patios draped in tapestries of elven silk that shield the market from the beating sun of the great rift above. The cries of exotic beasts, the smell of a thousand cuisines welcome weary travelers."

Standing in the shattered ruin of the Galuibar gate a decade past, it seemed a hopeless task to restore a long-abandoned city crawling with squatters and monsters. And yet, Ekluzagnu has bloomed into an oasis in every sense. An ancient spiral pipework that delves down to some hidden enclave at the river still faithfully pipes water through the citadel even after what must have been a thousand and odd years. It feeds a system of pipelike flows tucked away in the eaves of the caverns, which themselves feed crystal-clear pools of water scattered through the labyrinthine twists of the hand-hewn city. The few shafts of sunlight that peek in past the shattered crest of the mountain foster bountiful gardens, planters and hanging pots filled with topsoil from the fertile bottomland downstream. This little Bulwar of the sands shines with ample splendor to suit an empire.\n\nDownriver, the modest city of Suruzagnu had largely dominated the region, but the reconstruction of the Ekluzagnu has outpaced it in glory.
