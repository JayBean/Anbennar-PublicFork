 bulwar_flavour.1.d:0 "The lands that have been occupied by the gnolls for so long are now no longer in their control, which allows for the return of the Surani people to the land they fled from so long ago. Groups of them have been spotted trying to return 'home'. This has caused some stir. Should we allow them to return to their lands?"

 bulwar_flavour.2.t:0 "An Offer of Help"
 bulwar_flavour.2.d:0 "An elven warrior has appeared in our court. He calls himself by the name of Kamnaril of the Sands. Supposedly he claims to be a Jaddari officer, the son of a veteran of Jaher's conquests. He speaks of a different take our relationship to Surakel. While the Sun Elves would have us believe that only they can fulfill the duties of the deceased god, Kamnaril speaks of how the Jaddari see that all who are faithful can take the burden of Surakel. He proposes a world wherein we are no longer subservient to the sun elves."

 bulwar_flavour.3.t:0 "A Faith of Tolerance?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.da:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country. They speak of a new religion, one that promotes tolerance of all races. This 'Jadd' they speak of has them organise in their own communes and do work in the name of their sun god. They even have started preaching on the street to anyone who would listen, saying that the darkness in their hearts must be banished and that all are welcome within the light of 'Surael'. More and more are starting to listen to them. Can we really let this continue?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.db:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country, speaking heresy. They claim that Surael has not really entrusted the Sun Elves with his duties and that instead his duties fall to everyone who follows his light. They are encouraging the peasants to take more and more power into their own hands. This is disturbing the public order! Can we really let this continue?"

 bulwar_flavour.5.d:0 "While we try to live harmoniously with other races, politics and ambition brings out the worst in people. A political rivalry in [Root.GetName] has spiraled out of control to the point where one sought to use the other's racial heritage against them, starting a slander campaign against all members of his kind. This started locally but it is likely to affect the entire country!"

 bulwar_flavour.6.d:0 "We have been approached by an elf in foreign dress. His tanned skin and pale hair go combined with garb that say he is one of the Jaddari, remnants of Jaher's legions that became desert warriors and turned towards a strange faith. Shall we take him on as our commander? He might be a great help in our wars."

The people will dance in the street and sacrifices of bread and water will be offered up to his Radiance. All will work towards the great execution of this feast.

 bulwar_flavour.9.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetName] have been misguided in their faith.

 bulwar_flavour.10.d:0 "The knowledge that their people will be accepted in the country does favours for their acceptance of the government. The people in [target_province.GetName] have seen the treatment of their brethren within the Jadd and accepted Surael's light. They are visiting local temples and starting to learn their daily prayers and traditions. They are well on their way to becoming good propagators of the principles of the Jadd."

Already new local communities are forming around the organisation of the Jadd faith. Among them are pockets of zealous warriors only all to eager to serve their faith in whatever way their leaders ask of them. If we allow this to go on they might create great instability in the country!"

Tell me, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], have the people truly seen the light and should we follow in their conversion, or are harsher measures necessary?"

 #Rebuilding the Ekluzagnu

 rebuild_the_stone_palace_desc:0 "Ekluzagnu, the Stone Palace, lies in ruins. The prestigious, ornate fortress, the center of states that have come and gone for millennia has long served as a symbol of dominance over the Šad Sur. Were we to revitalize the wonder, it would create a trophy that proves our legitimacy, and solidify our grasp on the region."
 bulwar_flavour.26.t:0 "Rebuilding the Ekluzagnu"
 bulwar_flavour.26.d:0 "A quick loop of the mountain on horseback makes clear the nature of the fortress, of all that need be done. The swift bend of the Panuzagnu river cuts beneath the sheer cliff at the mountain's end, the old gate watchful in its long vigil over cloud-kissed peaks of the mountains beyond. The depths of the first citadel remain surprisingly well preserved, still decorated with murals boasting the feats of ancient Bulwari kings, even if they've been stripped of their valuable ornaments. The reason for the fortress's abandonment, however, lies clear in the scattered bones, the potsherds, the broken stones beyond the toppled gates that litter Galuibar -- the Demonscar.\n\nA rift melted through what seems a half a league of solid mountain, by Xhazobine's fury, the blackened gulch has long supplanted the old gate. With the sun shining bright down through the open wound in the stone above, the scene is laid bare. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands amidst the vast rift, gazing down through a scar that had healed into a bustling way lined with dwellings, storefronts, temples, all the long-abandoned cogs that set a city turning. The scars of war seem fresh, even after centuries from arrows still embed in half-rotted posts, to stagnant pools of water beneath shattered aqueducts. The past weighs heavy, amidst the scattered stones of a gatehouse so laden with scars that it seemed to have been rebuilt a hundred times over. If the Ekluzagnu had fallen before, stripped from the Bulwari who first set chisel to stone, from Zehia, shattered by Xhazobine, from the Castanites, the folk of the Šad Sur... How can [Root.Monarch.GetName] hope to set the walls anew, see that their stones never crumble, as so many before?\n\nYet, the crossroad stands at a crossroads. Shall we exploit this progress to turn it to an impenetrable fortress, or stand upon the shoulders of this splendid progress to make it a palace, a monument to our glory?"

 bulwar_flavour.27.da:0 "While no city is built in a day, a mere decade seems as the blink of an eye, for how far we have come. Standing in the shattered ruin of the Galuibar gate a decade past, it seemed a hopeless task to restore a long-abandoned city crawling with squatters and monsters. And yet, the black gate stands tall. With its façade hewn from the black stone of the Demonscar, the imposing wall of stone stands in defiance of those who would consign this grand city to history. Even an experimental shot from one of our most powerful canons failed to leave an obvious proofmark in that stone gate. It looms over the sands, deep and dark as the void between the stars. Adorned in marble with fierce visages of snarling gnolls, the vigilant helms of the Bulwari, the Castanites, the Ekluzagnu displays the united will of all who have dwelt within its walls, all who ever shall, that it has stood proud two thousand years, and shall stand two thousand more.\n\nDownriver, the modest city of Suruzagnu had largely dominated the region, but the reconstruction of the Ekluzagnu has outpaced it in glory. Just as it flourished, so too blooms the 'little stone' of the stone palace. While the traders, diplomats, and sightseers are most often drawn to the now-bustling Galuibar's stone-hewn markets, the whole region grows prosperous, into an oasis in the overland route from Bulwar through the Salahad. The ancient dwellings, inhabited on and off for a thousand years now play host to shops that hawk exotic goods from the four corners of Halann, their patios draped in tapestries of elven silk that shield the market from the beating sun of the great rift above. The cries of exotic beasts, the smell of a thousand cuisines welcome weary travelers."

Standing in the shattered ruin of the Galuibar gate a decade past, it seemed a hopeless task to restore a long-abandoned city crawling with squatters and monsters. And yet, Ekluzagnu has bloomed into an oasis in every sense. An ancient spiral pipework that delves down to some hidden enclave at the river still faithfully pipes water through the citadel even after what must have been a thousand and odd years. It feeds a system of pipelike flows tucked away in the eaves of the caverns, which themselves feed crystal-clear pools of water scattered through the labyrinthine twists of the hand-hewn city. The few shafts of sunlight that peek in past the shattered crest of the mountain foster bountiful gardens, planters and hanging pots filled with topsoil from the fertile land downstream. This little Bulwar of the sands shines with ample splendor to suit an empire.\n\nDownriver, the modest city of Suruzagnu had largely dominated the region, but the reconstruction of the Ekluzagnu has outpaced it in glory.

It was in this method that she slew the akal of Zanšap, who had the gall to claim the Šad Sur as his own homeland and yet in the end found himself victim to its labyrinthine passes.\n\n Galvanized by this victory, she would soon force the remaining mountain packs to submit to her ambitions and would go on to earn the epithet 'Cleaver-of-Realms' by subjugating the city of Bulwar after besting Karodir I Varamzuir in magical combat."

Named after the shadow cast by the local mountains, which very much resembles such a creature, it is celebrated by a strict adherence to all the Sun Cult's tenets and prayers to give Surael strength to bring back longer days (along with big plate of spiced ovine meat).\n\nRecently, with the influx of visitors to the restored Ekluzagnu, people from across Bulwar have learned of the tradition. Towns across the land have started to host their own versions of the festival, borrowing the Zanšapi name and rituals (even if no mountains cast any animal-shaped shadows in their vicinity). The herders, hearing about this, have mostly reacted with amusement, along with delight at this new-found market for their livestock. Now that word has reached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must decide [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reaction as well: should [Root.GetName] embrace this new tradition, with a state-sponsored feast at the next solstice, or should we leave it the domain of the peasants?"

That said, it must have happened at some point in the past few decades, for that is the only possibly provenance of today's shocking scene in [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nThe treasury was undergoing a careful inventory, when suddenly it rang with a series of loud explosions. Apparently, one of the guards had put his tea down on a dusty mahogany table that languished amidst other never-used gifts — and that act must have triggered some long-forgotten contingency spell. The table was instantly transmuted into a collection of spell tablets, which date at least to the Age of God-Kings.\n\nThe mage guild is clamoring for access to these, saying it will revolutionize their craft. But the guard claims to have been imbued with some of the same magic that revealed them, and as long as we are willing to provide him with copious tea, he will be able to master their knowledge in a way none other could.

 bulwar_flavour.108.d:0 "A mysterious desert nomad has arrived in a newly settled hamlet in [szal_ardeth_target.GetName] with an ominous warning: Leave or die. He says he is from the szal-Ardeth tribe, wardens of Amussu's Grave, near which the hamlet settled. According to legend, Amussu's grave hosts an ancient evil that must never be awoken, and the szal-Ardeth are the respected Mašnsih custodian tribe who ensure that none enter the place and risk awakening whatever may be in there. They say that if the settlement is not abandoned, they will summon the Sihrušam, the governing body of the seven Mašnsih tribes, and call for a direct attack against [szal_ardeth_target.GetName].\n\nOur learned wise men explain that the Amussu, after whom the tomb is named, is a mythological figure of Ancient Bulwar, one of the fabled God-Kings who bound Djinn to their will and had their every wish granted, he supposedly wished to be the only one who could wish, which rendered him mute. The learned men do emphasize that there must be a good reason to protect this place if the whole of the Sihrušam completely support any and all actions of the szal-Ardeth.\n\nThe skeptical in our court were quick to denounce the words of these wise men as silly fairy tales and ask [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to stand against the tribals who threaten the people of [Root.Country.GetName]."

The nomadic tribe's grudge against the gnolls led to them hunting gnoll bands ever since they were displaced, developing a set of brilliant tactics to break their organization and gain victory in the majority of conflicts between them. Their recruits were composed of former slaves who shared their deep hatred for the slavers, and they received support from the Sihrušam, or Sand Banner, the confederation of Mašnsih tribes.\n\nThough they are followers of the Jadd, which believes in the Enlightenment of monstrous races, their deep-seated hatred for gnollkind makes them care little for if a gnoll is Enlightened or not. The tribe has recently undertaken a deadly incursion against gnollish settlements near the oasis, killing indiscriminately and burning down everything in sight. The gnolls are now trying to recover from the blow, rebuilding their homes and preparing for future raids."

 bulwar_flavour.110.d:0 "Legends say that hidden within the Salahad desert is an ancient city from the time of the God-Kings: Ulmišbar. Founded by God-King Ulmiš and his bound genies along with his two sons and a thousand servants, the God-King wished to escape the constant intrigue and war of the rest of the God-Kings in Bulwar. He thus fled east, to the inhospitable Salahad desert, where he wished a great city of marble to be built and lived there in peace. After his death, his two sons fought over who would rule the city and take his immense wealth. It is said that during this brothers' war the Salahad desert then came to life and devoured the city whole.\n\nWith the unification of Bulwar, war and intrigue are less and less on people's minds, and adventurous spirits reign. There are more and more rumors circulating concerning the location of the city, which has garnered interest both from rich merchants, nobles and daring adventurers. Our advisors tell [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that we should organize an expedition to uncover the secrets hidden deep within the desert before someone else does.\n\nOne of the Mašnsih tribes of the Salahad, the szal-Fazil, are said to live among these ruins, guarding the ancient magical knowledge within and sharing it only with a spare few. They are devoted worshippers of Surakel, not recognizing Jaher as His reincarnation or Jaddar as His Herald and Prophet."

Though they are reticent to let the expedition in, they do say that they will not oppose the party with force of arms.\n\nWithin the great hill of sand is a huge depression where the szal-Fazil settled, the Buried Palace or Ekluqebru. Tents, stony homes and various buildings of human craft litter the area and many nomads are watching the expedition with clear suspicion. As the party heads deeper into this makeshift village, they notice quite a few learned men and women studying the magical craft with ancient relics and reactives and reagents that even the accompanying magi know of only due to their extensive research of exotic magical components.\n\nAs the expedition stops by an unearthed well whose supply of water is apparently unending, they are able to gather from the locals that Ulmišbar has three points of great interest that no one has yet been able to properly dig up and peer into: The Ulmiš palace, from which the God-King reigned; A great library holding untold amounts of knowledge from ancient Bulwar; And the temple of a forgotten God of old Bulwar."

Though they are reticent to let the expedition in, they do say that they will not oppose the party with force of arms.\n\nThe expedition quickly realizes that the szal-Fazil host plenty of mages. It seems they have harbored human mages who sought exile from the Empire to pursue arcane knowledge, going against the law of the Phoenix. They have developed their magical capabilities beyond the levels considered safe for the human mind. It seems there is a prominent reason as to why the mages gather here, and also as to how they were able to develop their skills so greatly in the middle of a desert: The artifacts and treasures that Ulmišbar provides them, they are imbued with knowledge of ancient Bulwar.\n\nOur armed men and archeologists have been retrieving these artifacts as the humans struggled to hide them to no avail. The few who dared defend their possessions paid dearly for their sacrilege. Soon a great pile of reagents, reactives, old relics and ancient tomes is formed in the middle of the town.

At a certain point, each member seems to spin a different tale, but all agree on the fact that the earth shook and an ominous, earpiercing roar was heard far in the distance.\n\nOur brave explorers say that they swiftly fled from the rooms they excavated and found themselves amidst a huge sandstorm, some say that they saw the shadow of a gigantic creature moving among the sands. After gathering as many artifacts as they could, the crew fled from Ulmišbar along with the panicked szal-Fazil. They heard a final bellow and the earth shook once more and when they looked back, the silhouette of Ulmišbar was gone, buried once more into the depths of the Salahad.\n\nThe crestfallen szal-Fazil tribe accompanied the expedition until they reached Saranza, their settlement which was once only used as a place to meet foreigners, now their permanent home, and stopped there while our party went on its way with the artifacts they took."

Made from the milk of Gelkari sheep, every batch is strictly tested to make sure it has reached the perfect texture and taste, and any wheel that is considered inadequate is immediately discarded. The perfect wheels are then supplied to the Sun Elves so that they may enjoy an exquisite meal at the end of their day.\n\nKoiní Sušizuir, one of the most famous cheese masters of Bulwar, has arrived at our court carrying the latest batch of Chosen slice.

Since then, Bulwari palates have been delighted with countless cheeses.\n\nOne of those cheeses is produced by the Gelkar shepherds of Lawaššar. A creamy, slightly moist, rindless cheese, it is aged for no more than six months. According to legend, this unique cheese was created when Ukdan Manad, a poor shepherd, was smitten by a harpy journeying past the cave he rested in. Abandoning his meager lunch of ewe's milk cheese and stale bread, he ran to try and catch her. When he returned dejected some weeks later, he saw distinctive veins of blue mold throughout his forgotten lunch - these veins of the same color as lapis are the pride of Lawaššar and its many imitators today, imparting a strong tanginess and fragrance with a short maturation time of only a few weeks.\n\nWe could invest in Lawaššar to increase the production, and make the world know the virtues of its cheese."

There was a time that their influence was greater than even some of the Twelve Families, but now they are a shadow of their former glory; they are dedicated to small commercial operations, and more often, to scams.\n\nToday, a Surani merchant by the name of Nanni approached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], calling for justice. It seems that he bought Eskuz, a Kuzarami cheese said to be the color of purest white and sporting holes artificially created to better represent Kuza, from one of the EaNasir.

Currently most Betfaziya belong to the naqta Betfaziya variant, which after a first maturation period is reduced into tiny bits by passing it through a mincing machine, then subjected to a second and third maturation period, for a total of 3 months. After this, the cheese is ready to be enjoyed by the Surani and their friends in Seghdihr.\n\nAn old text from the time of the Djinn Sultanates, attributed to a cheese master known as Adhriya, has been found in the libraries of Eduz-Vacyn, containing the oldest recipe of Betfaziya known to date. The recipe details the creation of what we know as brined betfaziya, a strong cheese of fast creation that after 4-5 days is ready for consumption. However, the recipe is accompanied by incantations to keep demons away from the cheese. Some scholars believe that the incantation enhances the cheese, while others believe that is a curse.

They demand that we march north, to Cannor, in order to combat its growing influence.\n\nAs speculation over the matter grows, the scholars of Bulwar are quick to gather, and just as quick to become divided over whether it is a natural or magical phenomenon. Their discussions are fervent as they mutter a thousand and one possible explanations as to why the sky of Cannor bleeds. Yet their words amount to little, as not a single one of them has provided evidence to support their dubious claims.\n\nRegardless of the truth, we cannot deny what our eyes see: and neither can the Cannorians. They seem to take it as a sign of the struggle between their pantheon, as their gods wage war against one another. With both the land and heavens of Cannor dyed red, their priests have taken to calling this event the Crimson Deluge. The whole continent boils with anger; the nations of Cannor begin to gather their armies. War seems inevitable.\n\nWith our recent forays into Cannor proving greatly successful, our advisors are confident that we can take advantage of this chaos.

He is a god, the only living god, and he stands alone against the Malevolent Dark.\n\nBut even a god can falter.\n\nKuza, Goddess of the Moon, was Surael’s mother. And, like all other gods, she perished. Despite her death, however, the moon still lingers. Her light is lesser than it once was, but it remains a constant and painful reminder of what had once been. Each and every day Surael flees upon her approach, wandering beyond the horizon and only returning to his garden once she has passed.\n\nSometimes, he is not quick enough. Sometimes, Surael comes face to face with his greatest failure. Sometimes, Surael gazes upon the moon, and Surael mourns.\n\nIn those rare days we call Eclipses, it is said that darkness covers Bulwar. As Surael falters, his faithful must light the world in his stead. Each and every man in Bulwar is obliged to light a flame, whether that be a candle or a large pyre, in mourning. In mourning for their god’s loss. For any loved ones who have succumbed to the Malevolent Dark.\n\nHundreds of thousands (if not millions) of fires, large and small, are said to be clearly seen from high above in the sky. From where Surael struggles, these lights remind him that he is not yet truly alone – and that he will never be alone for as long as his faithful draw breath. Surael, once again, is drawn out of his mourning.\n\nAs Kuza and Surael draw near to each other, preparations are made all across Bulwar. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is expected to light the largest of all flames."

 bulwar_flavour.125.d:0 "The Bloomsdawn Equinox is well-known in Bulwar as the beginning of spring, when days grow longer than nights and Surael begins to rise to the height of his power. Known as the Umašaru, the Day of the Lion, the Bloomsdawn Equinox has been celebrated by the peoples of Bulwar for generations, although the City of Kalib has always boisterously claimed to be the origin and namesake of the tradition.\n\nOpposite the Umaslu, which calls for moderation of one’s behavior and strict adherence to all of the Sun Cult’s teachings, the Umašaru is believed to be a short reprieve from one’s duties and responsibilities. As Surael grows in power once again, he weakens the influence of the Malevolent Dark upon the world – enough so for some merriment and relaxation to be found. During a single day each year, the faithful are encouraged to enjoy themselves to the fullest, and to spend the day in revelry not only with family, neighbors, and close companions, but also with distant relatives, acquaintances, travelers, and strangers.\n\nAlthough celebrated in most cities and towns of Bulwar, the event has never truly been acknowledged and officialized by the Namensar, who consider it to be nothing more than an excuse for debauchery and lapses in one’s faith. They thus favor far more diligent and respectful celebrations.\n\nSome of our advisors say there is no need for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take a stance on the matter, but our support of such a cherished tradition would undoubtedly bolster its popularity even further."

 bulwar_flavour.126.d:0 "Word spreads from town to town and from one end of the Suran to the other. Sarnagir, the Sun’s Herald, has been sighted. Flying far above Bulwar, it splits the clouds as it passes, leaving behind a lasting trail of fire and flame. It is majestic, radiant, and beautiful in equal measure.\n\nPushed by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors and confidantes, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] heading towards Brasan. Thousands join the hasty procession, and, after many days, the march finally arrives upon the Port of Emperors: only to find it already-crowded with pilgrims.\n\nPerched upon the walls of the City, the sun at its back, the proud and unfettered Sun’s Herald looms over all. It listens to the words of the common man, noble, and priest alike. It advises and it teaches, and its words ring clearly and without error. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] joins the long line that goes from one street of Brasan to the other, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] quietly awaits [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] turn to be granted audience.\n\nWhen the time finally comes for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to stand before it, the Sarnagir does not speak. It merely gazes down upon the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], its eyes burning, its form flickering like flames, too painful to gaze upon for long. After what feels like hours of silence, as all breathlessly await, a feather is gently battered by the wind. It drifts, its course seeming uncertain, only for it to come to a rest upon the cupped hands of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Sun’s Herald inclines its head. In its gleaming, fiery eyes, only one thing remains: approval.\n\nWeeks after it has departed, word continues to spread. Massive festivals are thrown all along the Suran in celebration, and all speak of what they had seen and heard. Their thoughts, united, are but one."

 bulwar_flavour.127.d:0 "The Exemplars do exemplary work. Always seeking to be the best version of themselves and to fulfill their duties to Surael, they have little time and patience to engage in economic affairs. They are already far too busy with their current responsibilities.\n\nFunding for their continued operations occasionally comes from charitable patrons and interested parties, but it is more commonly provided by the Akals and Kings they serve. With their funding assigned on a yearly basis, exemplars often hire a magistrate or merchant to bargain with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in their name.\n\nThe time has once again come for such a meeting to take place: and, after thorough discussions, an amount is decided upon. It is a considerable sum, but not an unreasonable one. It is expected that we grant them their funding as soon as possible.\n\nWe could do so... or we could convince the Namensar, a force with considerable influence amongst the Exemplars, to pay them in our stead. They will surely be happy to contribute."
 bulwar_flavour.127.a:0 "Give them what they requested."

 bulwar_flavour.128.d:0 "\n\nAs they grow older, most elves manage to acquire a remarkable repertoire of knowledge and skills. Although most are content to merely focus their efforts upon their chosen profession, there are a few who go even further, dedicating their entire lifespans to collecting the world’s bounty. Known by some as sages, by others as scholars, and by a few as fools, these elves wander from one place to another, never staying still for long.\n\nOne such elf has found his way to our court. Having offered a generous amount of coin to peruse our library, he has scarcely interacted with other courtiers and visitors. That changed, however, when he met our heir. The two have begun to often engage in conversation with each other, and it almost appears as though the elf has taken a new student under his wing. Events have developed to such a point that he has even come before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the rest of the court, officially offering his temporary services as a tutor. His motivation, when questioned, appears to be as much a willingness to see our heir’s education furthered as it is to see his duty as one of the Chosen fulfilled by sharing his knowledge with another.\n\nAlthough learning from such a scholar could prove beneficial for our heir, the Namensar were quick to pronounce their objection to the idea. They argue that the elf’s intentions are not to be trusted, and that he could potentially seek to subvert our heir’s adherence to the Old Sun Cult’s teachings in favor of his own."
 bulwar_flavour.128.a:0 "We could use his services."

The bowl confused our scholars, because these items were normally made of clay and used by practitioners of conjuration, and this bowl is inscribed with a divination spell, written in an ancient language related to northern Raheni, not to mention their expensive materials of dwarven origin. One of the scholars thinks that the bowl was used in a submersion ritual in which the bowl was placed face down in a vessel full of water, and this, according to the scholar, would 'bind' the future to the recipient, showing it to the magi."

 form_xhurekal_title:0 "Form Xhurekal"
 form_xhurekal_desc:0 "The gnolls of Bulwar are more often than not feared as monsters of the dark, hunting, capturing and enslaving those unfortunate enough to be caught by them, or sacrificing them to their demonic masters. But in some corners of Bulwar, the legacy of the Suncrown Gnolls endure, those who sought the Light of Surakel and stood against the unholy demons of the Xhaz in his name. We have heard these tales as we’ve come to rule over so much of Bulwar. Perhaps it is time we seek a brighter future."
 form_xhurekal_tt:0 "Every owned province of §YXhazobkult§! religion and §YGnollish§! culture will spawn rebels."
 form_musaskalam_title:0 "Form the Serpent-domain"
 form_musaskalam_desc:0 "For millennia, the magi of Bulwar have been hated, persecuted, and murdered, yet the hatred of the Lamagi, the not-mages, can’t change the truth: Bulwar is a place of magic, and magic is at the heart of the Bulwari civilization. There are still some that know this truth, like the Cult of the Serpent: Magi and Lamagi who share the goal of reclaiming the true heritage of the Bulwari, and destroying those who oppose Surakel and his servants. Fifteen hundred years ago there was an empire, a magnificent country ruled by the Magi, an empire on par with the Cannorian powers of Antiquity. This empire almost brought the gift of magic to all true Bulwari.\n\nNow it is time for its return."

 #Estate Renames
 estate_kigkasil:0 "Kigkasil"
 estate_kigkasil_desc:0 "The Kigkasil are a sacred brotherhood, unique to the sun-kissed lands of Bulwar. They were founded in antiquity with the objective of exploring the dangerous Dungeon of Suhuškar, but they primarily served as adventurers, mercenaries, and everymen who completed various odd jobs which the rulers of Bulwar required. Kept in line by the Sultan who ruled the brotherhood– always a Mirzizig, an Air Planetouched– the Kigkasil adventurers have proven readily capable, thanks to their djinn relics... if they have also proven themselves quite a bit undisciplined.\n\n§TThis is integrated into the §YAdventurers Wanted!§! system. Having certain §Yprivileges§!, or §Yhigher influence§! §g(30+ and 60+ £estate_influence£)§! and §Yhigh loyalty§! §g(60+ £estate_loyalty£)§! will increase chances of resolving Adventurers Wanted! and remove unwanted province modifiers.§!"
 estate_ralkadezim:0 "Ralkadezim"
 estate_ralkadezim_desc:0 "In contrast to the trade-oriented and urban nobility of the Barktabi, the Ralkadezim find their bases of power in the fertile countryside of Bulwar. The Ralkadezim are composed of elves that were given tenancy in fertile river-lands by Sun Elven kings for their loyal service. While they may be the newest estate of Bulwar, they are rich and well-fed protectors of tradition and elven interests."
 estate_barkabti:0 "Barkabti"
 estate_barkabti_desc:0 "Constituting the urban trading nobility of Bulwar, the Barkabti are some of the oldest power players of Bulwar, with lines dating back to the aristocracy of the God-kings themselves. Compared to the Cannorian feudal nobility, the Barkabti differ in that their families are more similar to a clan structure, with many members and branches following a single family head. While of a more administrative and managerial stripe than most traditional nobility, the Barkabti are some of the most powerful players in the cities of Bulwar, controlling the vital arteries of wealth and manpower through political maneuvering, intrigue, or outright violence."
 estate_namensar:0 "Namensar"
 estate_namensar_desc:0 "Composed of priests, scribes, theologians, and members of the holy orders, the Namensar represent the interests of the Sun Cult Temples, from the great complexes of the Suran to the cliffside monasteries of Gelkalis. As a force almost as ancient as Bulwar itself, the Namensar are a force to be reckoned with. While their priorities may be divided between self-interest and care for the spiritual health of the nation, they are nevertheless an important part of all Bulwari society."
 estate_sabari:0 "Šabari"
 estate_sabari_desc:0 "The Šabari are the low urban nobility of Bulwar, composed primarily of the members of the innumerable merchant and artisan guilds, a nobility that cannot boast of ancestors as notable as the Barkabti can. While their relatively-low position in the social hierarchy may fool a ruler into disrespecting their privileges, they hold almost complete authority over the productive forces and trade winds of the Bulwari metropolises."
 estate_flocks:0 "Flock Matriarchs"
 estate_flocks_desc:0 "Flocks, the smallest unit of harpy society, are flexible collections of harpy families. Rather than being divided by ethnic or geographic lines, they are divided by their flock matriarch: and these matriarchs have pledged loyalty to our sovereign. They are now tasked by us with maintaining stability and prosperity in their lands."
 estate_songsters:0 "Riaveltor"
 estate_songsters_desc:0 "The closest approximation to clergy in a harpy society, the Riaveltor– also known as Songsters– are tasked with remembering the various songs and hymns unique to their kin. In addition to these religious duties, the Songsters also sing during festivals, and pass down their knowledge to the next generation. They are living libraries for their flock."
 estate_magi_desc:0 "Beloved and hated in equal parts, the Magi of Bulwar belong to the oldest tradition of human magic, an uninterrupted line that dates back to the Age of God-kings. The Magi are divided in 4 “knowings,” or schools: the Kiribrašin, or World-gardeners, mages of Order that bend nature to their will; the Kašipti, or Exorcist-priests, mages who are able to use Surael’s Light; the Kurešimi, or Wishcrafters, secretive craftsmen that create powerful magic objects; and the despised Haragallu, or Binding-demons, who bind other beings to their will.\n\n§TMages can §YCast Spells§! for the country, but this requires a minimum amount of §Y15%§! £estate_influence£ to do so.

 estate_wishcrafters:0 "Kurešimi Artificers"
 estate_wishcrafters_desc:0 "Since antiquity, the schools and clans of the Kurešimi Magi have produced objects of great quality and power through Inscription, a secretive form of magic inspired by the way the Djinn used to craft their relics. With the rise of global artificery and the interchange of ideas with other regions of Halaan, some groups of Kurešimi have incorporated these new ideas into Inscription (while keeping their own methods hidden from Cannorians), thereby reinvigorating the craft and its value to our nation."

 estate_vetaunyar:0 "Vetaunyar"
 estate_vetaunyar_desc:0 "The Vetaunyar, or Born from the Song, are mages of the harpies, a race that has a greater number of magically gifted individuals than humans. Due to their interaction with the Bulwari Magi, they know many of their spells and crafts, but they also possess a magic of their own: Ištarun. This type of magic, often classified as Bardic, is a collaborative art of spell-singing. Young harpy mages form lifetime groups called Sanarenni, or Songbird Sisters, who fight and work together to perform powerful magics.\n\n§TMages can §YCast Spells§! for the country, but this requires a minimum amount of §Y15%§! £estate_influence£ to do so.

 estate_harpy_merchants:0 "Velmišše Flocks"
 estate_harpy_merchants_desc:0 "Velmišše harpies are traders, diplomats, and craftswomen who follow the Doctrine of the Velmišše, or demoiselle crane. The Doctrine emphasizes the Hunt for material wealth and economic power, and harpies who follow this doctrine form their own subflocks which operate similarly to Cannorian guilds or Bulwari Šabari houses. Velmišše flocks are often composed of harpies from all the different flocks of the Matriarchy, making them a very influential force in harpy politics."
