 ynn_barges.1.t:0 "The Final Journey"
 ynn_barges.1.d1:0 "For years, $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has ruled our nation. For good or ill, they have led our people towards tomorrow. Today, however, their journey of leadership has ended, and their journey toward the afterlife, their journey along the sacred Ynn, begins. If this journey is to be successful, however, we must ensure proper transportation, so as to keep our ruler untainted from any impure floating in the River."
 ynn_barges.1.d2:0 "A previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has died. For good or ill, they have led our people towards tomorrow, and continued leading as head of their family once their term ended. Today, however, their journey of leadership has ended, and their journey toward the afterlife, their journey along the sacred Ynn, begins. If this journey is to be successful, however, we must ensure proper transportation, so as to keep our ruler untainted from any impure floating in the River."

 ynn_barges.2.d1:0 "The barge of the dead monarch of [From.GetName] has arrived at our Great Ynnic Dam of [Root.GetName]. If they are to continue their journey down the Ynn, is up to us to decide."
 ynn_barges.2.d2:0 "The barge of our dead monarch $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has arrived at our Great Ynnic Dam of [Root.GetName]. The inhabitants observe with the due reverence as the barge floats onward, nearing the dam's gates."

 ynn_barges.2.b:0 "Charge the toll"
 ynn_barges.2.c:0 "Turn them back"
 ynn_barges.2.e:0 "Let our monarch through"
 
 ynn_barges.3.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Demands a Toll"
 ynn_barges.3.d:0 "The [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName], holder of the Great Ynnic Dam of [From.GetName], demands a toll from our nation if our monarch is to pass. Though many see this as little more than extortion, if we wish to properly deliver $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ to the Divine Waterfall, we may just have to pay up. However, the option always remains to sink the barge, and have our monarch pass through with the commoners, if need be."
 ynn_barges.3.c:0 "We'll just open up the dam ourselves"
 ynn_barges.3.a:0 "Very well"
 ynn_barges.3.b:0 "Sink the barge"
 
 ynn_barges.4.t:0 "Payment Arrives"
 ynn_barges.4.d:0 "Another barge originating from [From.GetName] has arrived, sailing low in the water, due to its cargo: a massive quantity of coinage. It seems our toll has been payed for."

 ynn_barges.5.t:0 "No Reply"
 ynn_barges.5.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have sunk their own barge, allowing their monarch to float with the rest of the dead through the Commoner's Gate."
 ynn_barges.5.a:0 "That settles that then"
 
 ynn_barges.6.t:0 "Our Barge Didn't Make It"
 ynn_barges.6.d:0 "With our barge stopped, we have been forced to a last resort: to let our monarch float along the River on their own. Though they run the risk of being tainted by the evil souls who may be floating in the River, at least this way they will make it to the afterlife, for better or worse."
 ynn_barges.6.a:0 "Hopefully they have better luck in the next world"
 
 ynn_barges.7.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Prevents Passage"
 ynn_barges.7.d:0 "It seems that the [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName] has stopped our barge from continuing its holy journey, leaving us with no choice but to sink the barge, and have our ruler run the risk of being tainted. There seems to be nothing we can do, and their ruler appears to have no intention of changing their mind."
 ynn_barges.7.a:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] will pay"

 ynn_barges.9.d:0 "The barge carrying our monarch has reached the end of the Ynn, and, at the Divine Waterfall, our monarch moves on to the next life, pure of any taint of this mortal realm. With their journey ended, a new journey, the journey of [Root.Monarch.GetName], can finally begin."
 ynn_barges.9.a:0 "From yesterday to tomorrow"
 
 ynn_barges.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Forces their Way Through"
 ynn_barges.10.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have used the ongoing conflict to send troops to seize our dam, and opened up its gate to their barge."
 ynn_barges.10.a:0 "They weren't supposed to do that!"
 
 ynn_barges.11.t:0 "Ynnic Barge Lands"
 ynn_barges.11.d1:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of an ancestor has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into the lake from the Great Waterfall above.

 ynn_barges.11.d2:0 "A vessel has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above.

 ynn_barges.11.d3:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of a dead Ynnic monarch has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above.

 #Ynn Events
 ynn_events.0.t:0 "Reurbanization"
 ynn_events.0.d:0 "After centuries of decay, warfare, and abandonment in favour of the countryside, the peace brought about by our nation has allowed the hub cities along the Ynn River to know prosperity once again, reaching levels of urban sprawl unseen since the times of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nWhere once laid ruins and decayed buildings getting scavenged for materials, are now blooming metropolises whose streets draw all from Cannorian fighters to Raheni merchants, and all along the Ynn people are thanking our nation for that."
 ynn_events.0.a:0 "May this be an age of even greater prosperity"
  
 ynn_events.1.t:0 "Clearing Out the Tromseloc Way"
 ynn_events.1.d:0 "A group of three riders bearing the banners of [Root.GetName] rode through the mist, the eerie silence of Tromseloc only broken by the squishes of their steeds' hooves on the old muddy path. Riding ahead to a ruined waypost of faint red and white paint, the captain gazed between the cracked walls, and saw the movement of antlers. "Be ready everyone, it looks like we've cornered a wendigo." The captain said to his companions, before dismounting and approaching the door.\n\nWith a kick, the old door was shattered, and the captain stepped inside sword in hand, turning to the right and raising his blade to meet the claws of the incoming wendigo."
 ynn_events.1.a:0 "If the way is clear? It's clear enough for an army to march through if they're careful."

 ynn_events.6.t:0 "Iosahar Drifts Away"
 ynn_events.6.d:0 "Our Iosahar in [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] has been acting independently for quite some time now, acknowledging our Overlordship but not our authority. They've used their distance from our capital as an excuse to conveniently forget about our edicts, our missives, and - Ynn be merciful - our party invitations, hoping that we wouldn't notice their absence.\n\nIf we don't act soon, [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] may declare full independence."
 ynn_events.6.a:0 "Remind them who rules."
 ynn_events.6.b:0 "We don't need their sword; their tribute is enough."

 ynn_events.7.t:0 "Overlord Infringes on Tradition"
 ynn_events.7.d1:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has declared the Iosahar system obsolete, undoing the work our predecessors have done to establish a land of equal lords. Clearly, [From.Monarch.GetName] is seeking to restore the excesses of power that led to the fall of the Ynnic Empire! Shall someone do something about this?"
 ynn_events.7.d2:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has turned [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] back on Ynn River Worship, converting to a new foreign religion. Clearly, [From.Monarch.GetName] has gone mad, and now this madness threatens to engulf the entire realm! Shall someone do something about this?"
 ynn_events.7.a:0 "We shall rise up!"
 ynn_events.7.b:0 "Back down."

 ynn_events.8.t:0 "The Great Iosahar Insurrection"
 ynn_events.8.d1:0 "Our Oathkeeping subjects have risen up in rebellion: led by [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], they are clearly displeased with our choice to bring an end to the complacency and selfishness enabled by the Iosahar system. It is too late to back down now, all we have left to do is crush this rebellion, and our rule over the Ynn will be solidified forevermore."
 ynn_events.8.d2:0 "Our Oathkeeping subjects have risen up in rebellion: led by [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], they are clearly displeased with our choice to bring the light of a new religion to this land. It is too late to back down now, all we have left to do is crush this rebellion, and our rule over the Ynn will be solidified forevermore."

 ynn_events.9.d1:0 "We have been bested in war and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now bends the knee before [From.GetName], pledging [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] purse. We may bide our time and throw off their yoke one day, perhaps becoming Overlord ourselves. In the meantime…"
 ynn_events.9.d2:0 "We have been bested in war by one of the Antler Lords, and were forced to bend the knee. The City of Warriors and its institutions lay at the mercy of [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], to whom we will pledge our swords and coins from now on."

 ynn_events.17.t:0 "The Dragon Kingdom"
 ynn_events.17.d:0 "The Rzentur share much of the customs and lifestyle of broader Ynnic culture, however ever since the overthrowing of Lord Trantan and the rise of the Drozma Tur faith, a wedge has been driven between the River-worshipping Sarda and Dolindhans and their Dragon-worshipping Rzentur cousins, who are once again decried as "barbaric" by the other two.\n\nEvents such as the rise of the Great Heathen Host, culminating in the slaying of Drozmagog at the hands of a Ynnic knight, have further driven this wedge, resulting in a sharp turn for the still-nascent tradition of Rzentan chivalry.\n\nWhile many knights are still employed by Rzentur rulers, individualism is no longer encouraged nor are heroic deeds emphasized, and the informal code of Overlord-Vassal relationship developed during the apex of Amacimst and Amaceped - the Two Castles Period - has been put to the wayside: the strongest Rzentur Lord rules with the title of Ladr - Duke - as a superior to his other vassals and the sole enforcer of the Dragon's will."
 ynn_events.17.a:0 "It is time to bury the antlers."
 ynn_events.17.b:0 "We will conquer the Ynnics using their laws."
 ynn_17_tooltip:0 "Every Rzentur §YIosahar§! subject becomes a normal §YVassal§!, gaining §R+20%§! Liberty Desire and losing §R10§! Trust.\nYou won't be able to make new §YIosahar§!."
 ynn_17_tooltip_really_good_idea:0 "§RYour Dolindhan vassals will not like this.§!"
 
 ynn_events.18.t:0 "Oath-bending"
 ynn_events.18.d1:0 "Our distant Overlord in [From.GetName] expected us to bend the knee, pledge our sword and pay taxes to a distant capital, but no longer!\n\nThrough some careful maneuvering, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to become free in all but name, only some sending some small, modest tribute to [From.GetName] occasionally."
 ynn_events.18.d2:0 "Our distant Overlord in [From.GetName] expected us to bend the knee, pledge our sword and pay taxes to a distant capital, but no longer!\n\nThrough some careful maneuvering, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to become free not just in fact but also in name, shedding the need maintain any pretence of vassalhood."
 ynn_events.18.a:0 "Outstanding move."
 
 ynn_events.22.t:0 "Visitors from Below"
 ynn_events.22.d:0 "Having for long stood on what we considered the edge of the world, the visitors who arrive to [1133.GetName] from below are usually limited to the occasional group of Boek climbers or Cheshoshi mercenaries, but today that changed: elves with pinkish skin and rounded ears - not unlike those of a knight - came visiting the holy city, bringing with them not just weapons and pouches, but also carriages pulled by small, antlerless horses.\n\nUpon questioning, we were surprised to learn that the majority of them were not elves at all, but a variety of species: what they had in common was that they all hailed from a farawy continent known as "Krarh Nor", the New Land.\n\nTheir carriages were filled with exotic crops, quality furniture, new and unconventional weapons, garments worthy of our ladies, even a tasty tree-shaped food item called mushroom. In exchange for their gifts, they simply asked to be let into the city, where they could witness the great dam of [1133.GetName], the sight of which had drawn them from afar."
 ynn_events.22.a:0 "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to [1133.GetName]."
 ynn_events.22.b:0 "Guards! Turn these vagrants away."
 ynn_22_tooltip:0 "The visitors leave disappointed."
 
 ynn_events.24.t:0 "The Dragon Cult's Last Stand"
 ynn_events.24.d:0 ""The [Root.GetAdjective] are coming! Sound the alarm!" Erethra Dolenmach shouted, running from one bell tower to another.\n\nAs the bells rang through the streets of [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName], hundreds, thousands of followers came out out of their homes. A mob armed with torches, axes, and whatever objects they could find, also bolstered by the few elite devouts to the Drozma Tur cause still remainining, now form a barrier several rows deep between the Dragon Prince and [Root.GetName]'s approaching [Root.KnightsWarriors]. Little can be said or done, as the [Root.KnightsWarriors] grimly advance, while the cultists wave their blades and draw their bows…"

 ynn_events.26.t:0 "The Dragon Cult Vanquished"
 ynn_events.26.d1:0 "It is done. We have crushed the crazed mob of the Dragon Cult, and slashed our way through [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName]'s streets, reaching the palace of deviancy where the Dragon Prince was being raised and revered. Our [Root.KnightsWarriors] disarmed the enchanted gates and entered the palace's garden, exchanging magical blows of fire and water with the Dragon Cult's last defenders. The fighting continued on the inside, as we fought room-by-room, until every Rzentur in the building lay dead.\n\nOnce the dust settled, our mages determined that the Dragon Prince was dead, and presented us with the body of a teenaged boy in noble clothes, none other than the creature itself having taken Rzentur form."
 ynn_events.26.d2:0 "It is done. We have crushed the crazed mob of the Dragon Cult, and slashed our way through [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName]'s streets, reaching the palace of deviancy where the Dragon Prince was being raised and revered. The creature didn't wait for us any longer, and perched itself on the roof of the palace, growling at our [Root.KnightsWarriors] before spitting a cloud of flames at them, repelled by the water shields cast by our mages.\n\nOnce the dust settled, the dragon lay dead among the rubble of the now-ruined palace and countless corpses of our [Root.KnightsWarriors]. All the same, our surviving troops raise their blades to the sky and cheer, for few can say they have accomplished the deeds that transpired in [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName] today."
 ynn_events.26.d3:0 "It is done. We have crushed the crazed mob of the Dragon Cult, and slashed our way through [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName]'s streets, reaching the palace of deviancy where the Dragon Prince was being raised and revered. The creature didn't wait for us any longer, and perched itself on the roof of the palace, growling at our [Root.KnightsWarriors] before spitting a cloud of flames at them, repelled by the water shields cast by our mages. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood at the front, wielding a spear and charging at the beast.\n\nOnce the dust settled, the dragon lay dead among the rubble of the now-ruined palace and countless corpses of our [Root.KnightsWarriors]. Alas, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was among those who perished in the fight, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death the ultimate sacrifice for the Dragon Cult's final defeat. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] remains were swiftly attended to by the best embalmers that were accompanying our army, and trusted carpenters were summoned to craft a royal coffin and barge. The streets of [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName] are now filled with sorrow and celebration in equal measure as they await [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s funeral."
 ynn_events.26.d4:0 "It is done.

Our surviving troops raise their blades to the sky and cheer, to their victory today, and to the victory of their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who will be immortalized in Ynnic memory as the second coming of Artorean."

 ynn_events.106.t:0 "Devastating Floods"
 ynn_events.106.d1:0 "The province of [Root.GetName] has been brutally flooded by the Ynn River, and despite the local rescuers' valiant efforts, direct aid from our [Root.Owner.GovernmentName] is required in order to dispatch enough rescue teams to save [Root.GetName]'s population and fund their reconstruction."

The situation is especially dire in [Root.GetName], where emergency workers have been desperately reinforcing the embankments along the main stem of the Ynn, while the bravest Tide-Guards set out to rescue people and valuables from the crumbled buildings that were carried away.\n\nDespite these efforts, [Root.GetName]'s local forces are not enough, and they are requesting the [Root.Owner.GovernmentName]'s assistance. An assistance we cannot give, as our entire country is also battling the wrath the River."

 ynn_events.107.t:0 "Great Dam Requires Maintenance"
 ynn_events.107.d1:0 "Dams are powerful structures, built to endure the force of a running river - even then, they need regular controls and maintenance, and for a river as enormous as the Ynn these can become enormously costly. The Great Dam of [Root.GetName] is in need of such maintenance, as per the inspectors' report, and our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] was called to help.\n\nWhile private citizens can raise enough resources and workforce to plug the leakages and avoid a disastrous collapse of the Dam, traditionally the Ynnic Empire and its successor states have been providing the bulk of the capital needed to keep the dams fully operational and ensure they retain their true monumental grandeur."
 ynn_events.107.d2:0 "The Great Dam of [Root.GetName], powerful as it may be, has received a considerable amount of damage whether from besieging armies or prolonged neglect.

 ynn_events.110.t:0 "We Must Demand Satisfaction!"
 ynn_events.110.d:0 "A recently received supposed gesture of diplomacy from [ynn_joust_offender.GetName] turned out to be nothing more than a blatant insult. In accordance with the rules of chivalry, the words spoken can be justification for a duel of honour, traditionally in the form of a joust.\n\nWhile it may be foolhardy to risk life and limb over the gabble of some arrogant [ynn_joust_offender.Monarch.GetTitle] with a clear lack of etiquette, a lack of challenge on our part over this matter will be interpreted by many to mean the offending words were true!"

 ynn_events.112.d:0 "The two jousters meet on the assigned day. Lists have been put up in neutral territory on a piece of dry and flat land. A small crowd of nobles and gentry with their banners flying in the wind, as well as others less well-born have gathered to witness justice. Overseeing the proceedings, ensuring honourable behaviour and making an unbiased verdict, are the River-Priests. They appear inanimate and stoic next to the rest of the onlookers, who roar in support and jeer in disdain as the combatants approach.\n\nAt the sound of a bugle the jousters begin the charge. With lances levelled and vision poised they advance, dirt flying from the hooves of their massive antler horses as they gallop forward at thundering speeds despite the glamorously armoured riders.\n\n[Root.YnnEvents112Bloc0]"
 YnnEvents112Bloc0_1:0 "After several turns the winner still remains unclear. The proud antler horses pant with exertion as squires hurry to deliver the replacement lances.

 ynn_events.305.a:0 "Water destroys, but also creates. Let's start a rebuilding effort!"
 ynn_events.305.b:0 "I'm not obliged to pay for every rodent that moves a twig, am I?"

 ynn_events.306.t:0 "Pet Ynnea Pig?"
 ynn_events.306.d:0 "Covered in fur and of diminutive size, the Ynnea Pig is a popular pet among Ynnic upper classes. It is not from the same family as pigs, rather it is a rodent (in fact the 'Pig' part of the name is a Cannorian invention - among Ynnics it is known as 'Kui' after the noise it makes); all the same, this animal possesses the same voracity as pigs and highly prefers to live in groups, making its maintenance not as cheap as one would initially predict. It is also rumoured to have healing powers purifying those who are near it.\n\nToday [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has approached a pet merchant while passing the [Root.Capital.GetAdjective] markets, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eye was caught by a particularly friendly one. Is it time to purchase a pet?"
 ynn_events.306.a:0 "Why, I will take good care of this animal!"
 ynn_events.306.b:0 "Sadly I've never had a passion for small furry critters."

 ynn_events.307.t:0 "Whitetail Fox Sighted!"
 ynn_events.307.d:0 ""Fox! I've seen a fox!" has become a common shout across the province of [ynn_whitetail_prov.GetName], after a whitetail fox created its den near a local village much to the inhabitants' glee. Legend says that when the first elves wandered the land after the Ending Flood cleansed the world, everyone was uncertain on what to do until a fox approached people and taught them how to rebuild society.\n\nNow, new faces are joining the village in [ynn_whitetail_prov.GetName] and its inhabitants are working at a brisker pace than before, and who's to say whether this is the influence of the fox at work or a simple superstition acting in our favour?"
 ynn_events.307.a:0 "What does the fox say?"

 ynn_events.308.t:0 "Komenvecer"
 ynn_events.308.d:0 "Komenvecer or 'Stone Dinner' refers to a dinner or festivity where various seafoods are presented, featuring as the main course a large platter of Stone Fish which all diners are expected to take a piece from. Most typically held around the halfway point of the Stone Fish Stuir Balia, Komenvecer can also be organized when there's a big catch of fish or whenever the local lord feels a craving for it.\n\nAnd naturally, when it is someone as powerful as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] organizing a Komenvecer for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] noble Iosahar, the seafood can be expected to be both abundant and delicious!"
 ynn_events.308.a:0 "Time to dig in!"
 ynn_events.308.b:0 "I need to excuse myself."

 ynn_events.309.t:0 "A Successful Komenvecer"
 ynn_events.309.d:0 "The Iosahar laugh amiably as they bid their farewells to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] at the end of the Komenvecer, rising from the broad banquet table where only emptied plates remain. Some Iosahar are intoxicated - but not by the food, of course, rather by the wine. Everyone was impressed with the culinary skills of the chefs of [Root.GetName] and the finesse of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s hand-picked kitchen staff."
 ynn_events.309.a:0 "Let's do this again next year!"

 ynn_events.310.t:0 "A Fishy Komenvecer"
 ynn_events.310.d:0 "You could swear the Stone Fish tasted funny for a moment, but you did not want to concern the other table companions who seemed absorbed in the feast. Now, a few weeks have passed, and you have heard the news of many [Root.GetAdjective] Iosahar coming down with stomach pains and fevers. While nobody would accuse [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as the responsible of that, many suspect the food intoxication had a certain degree of correlation with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] recent feast."
 ynn_events.310.a:0 "Let's just hope nothing bad happens to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 ynn_events.311.t:0 "Rivalry Between Sky and Water"
 ynn_events.311.desc:0 "An incessant barrage of rain and thunder has been striking the province of [ynn_thunderdome_prov.GetName] over the last few weeks, in what the locals swore to be no mere rainstorm. Our agents investigated and found it to be the truth: the rainfall and thunderbolts are in fact the vicious blows of two creatures, a Thunderbird and an Underwater Lynx, locked in a bitter fight to the death judging by the severity of their attacks.\n\nWe may tell [ynn_thunderdome_prov.GetName]'s inhabitants to stay sheltered in their homes for as long as it takes for one of the fighters to beat the other, however the damage brought by the ever-worsening weather may well prove disastrous by then. To bring a swifter end to this, we are aware of rituals that can placate zodiac creatures and restore the balance, however those who perform them will be at great risk, as they'll need to approach the very eye of the storm while the creatures trade blows."
 ynn_events.311.a:0 "Best to not interfere in supernatural fights."
 ynn_events.311.b:0 "Perform a ritual to placate the creatures! It's the only way to avert disaster!"
 ynn_events.311.c:0 "Ask the Veykodan druids for advice."
 ynn_events.311.d:0 "Summon the aid of Epednar shamans."

 ynn_events.312.t:0 "Taming a Wild Antler Horse"
 ynn_events.312.d:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seemed unusually late to return from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] last hunting trip, but just as the courtesans began to worry, there [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] appears from the horizon, and on a new ride. An antler horse of a massive size - far more than your usual war steed - is trotting along the route that leads to [Root.Capital.GetName], carrying [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] on its rugged back.\n\nArriving to [Root.Capital.GetName]'s gates to a row of impressed guards and frightened peasants, the ruler deftly descends along the creature's side and bids it farewell for now, as the horse begins its walk towards a nearby grove; the gates and streets simply weren't large enough for it either way."
 ynn_events.312.a:0 "The favour of a wild antler horse is a great sign of prestige!"
 ynn_events.312.b:0 "The earth shall tremble, and so shall our enemies."

 ynn_events.313.t:0 "Mysterious Beast Sinking Canoes"
 ynn_events.313.d:0 "Odd reports have been arriving from [river_monster_prov.GetName]! While it is quite common for ships, canoes, rowboats, and any other vessel daring to traverse the ynn to be sunk by the beasts below its surface, it is uncommon for such a beast to sink several vessels consistently. Exceedingly rare is it for such a vicious beast to remain within one area, but the river serpent in [river_monster_prov.GetName], which the locals fearfully dubbed: Drelvrydal, does indeed appear to be practically blockading the province with its attacks on all vessels who leave its port. The people have turned to their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for aid in the removal of the monster."
 ynn_events.313.a:0 "Hunt the damn thing down!"
 ynn_events.313.b:0 "We don't even have any method of capturing it"

 ynn_events.314.t:0 "The Beast is Caught!"
 ynn_events.314.d:0 "Despite doubts regarding the ability of the capable men sent to kill the monster of [river_monster_prov.GetName], the dreaded 'Drelvrydal', the brave sailors managed to catch and kill the beast. Whilst they suffered major casualties, and some even deign to claim some unknown Paddleboard Knight that did all the real work rather than the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s own appointed soldiers, it is with pride we hear the tales of the carcass of the beast being paraded through the towns and villages."
 ynn_events.314.a:0 "I told you it'd be easy"

 ynn_events.315.t:0 "The Elusive Drelvrydal"
 ynn_events.315.d:0 "It rips the nets! It smashes the fishing canoes! It drags the harpooners to the depths, sometimes taking a whole ships with them! The dreaded monster of [river_monster_prov.GetName] appears to be completely uncatchable, despite the best efforts of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s men. The residents have began to mutter that this is a sign the river does not favour us, a minor inconvenience compared to the economic consequences of a stretch of river void of transport vessels."
 ynn_events.315.a:0 "Stop sinking my fucking ships!"
 
 ynn_events.991.t:0 "The Many Colours of the Ynn"
 ynn_events.991.d:0 "The Ynn is a region where lordships are largely subjugated rather than annexed. Our cartographers have come with the innovative idea that we may colour the lordships that are subjugated by others the same colour as their overlord, so that they can easily be recognized as the same entity. Others argue that it will make it harder to see the borders of lordships over time, and insist that the colours should remain seperate."
 ynn_events.991.a:0 "Make them the same colour."
 ynn_events.991.b:0 "Give every lordship a different colour."
 ynn_events.991.c:0 "Make them the same colour, unless they aren't Chosen like ourselves."

 ynn_authority_events.100.d:0 "Every two years the Great Ynn River bursts its banks due to the melting of ice and the heavy spring and summer storms further upriver. Two years later the glaciers in the hills and mountains at the source of the river freeze once more and the waters recede. All life is the spawn of the Ynn, and this regular flooding gives the River's chosen a predictable time table for our harvest seasons. We plant just after the flood recedes and then harvest just before it floods again. The Stuir Balia, the start of another one of these cycles, has finally come.\n\nThis time however the river brings with it not just the new planting season but a bountiful gift. Along with the rushing currents has come a whole new layer of silt, full of vital minerals and nutrients to make our next harvest bountiful. Our people celebrate the Great River’s kindness and eagerly await next year's harvest."

Today we thank the River for its bountiful kindness and hope for another successful cycle next time."
 ynn_authority_events.101.a:0 "All hail the Great River"

 ynn_authority_events.102.t:0 "The Stuir Balia - Middling Year"
 ynn_authority_events.102.d:0 "Every two years the Great Ynn River bursts its banks due to the melting of ice and the heavy spring and summer storms further upriver.

We plant just after the flood recedes and then harvest just before it floods again. The Stuir Balia, the start of another one of these cycles, has finally come.\n\nUnfortunately the flood waters have been lower than usual.

 ynn_authority_events.103.d:0 "Today [Root.Monarch.GetName] has attended a feast thrown by the [Root.GetNobilityName]. While some of our monarch’s more cautious confidants were wary of such a regularly uncharacteristic event, our benevolent leader was quick to assuage their fears and attend the feast. Much to those same confidants’ surprise the feast turned out a raucous merriment with much drinking done, stories told and drunken ballads belted out. Those within our leader's circle rarely saw [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as happy as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] were that day. The next morning our leader left the feast with many new friends."

 ynn_authority_events.106.d:0 "The merchants of [ynn_lawless_merchant_prov.GetName] have been purposefully avoiding our stewards and their retinues, in an all too successful attempt at skirting our laws and undermining our authority. Naturally, this can not go unpunished: even if these shrewd merchants would be able to provide large economic growth in [ynn_lawless_merchant_prov.GetName], it unacceptably paints a picture of our government as weak and unimportant, in our own lands, let alone throughout the rest of the Ynn. So the order in [ynn_lawless_merchant_prov.GetName] must be restored."

 ynn_authority_events.108.d:0 "A group of very prestigious and formerly very wealthy nobles come to you reporting that a brigand from [ynn_rhovynuc_prov.GetName] has been targeting them and their wealth. This bandit seems to believe he is Rhovynuc reborn, the 9th-century bandit king who stole from the nobility then gave his ill-gotten gains to the peasantry. The mad pretender is, unfortunately, following the same practices of his infamous predecessor and continues to thieve from the most important of our realm, intending to unload his newfound wealth onto the peasantry.. To make matters worse the local garrison is completely outmatched by "Rhovynuc'' and his large bandit cohort. So the nobles have come asking for an army to be raised and sent to [ynn_rhovynuc_prov.GetName] to stop this non-consensual wealth transfer."

 ynn_authority_events.109.d:0 "In a not so unforeseeable event Rhovynuc has taken one of our tax collectors as his mark, unfortunately, that specific tax collector had just finished running his rounds in [ynn_rhovynuc_prov.GetName]. He was making his way back to the capital carrying many gold pieces when he was robbed. The poor collector now holds not a single piece of metal, precious or otherwise.

They seem to have begun to overflow with love for our benevolent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] far-seeing policies. In what they assure us is but a faint show of the true depths of their love, they have organized a grand hunt, followed by an equally grand feast.\n\nThe hunt lasted for nearly 3 hours and by the time the group returned to the camp they had ample meat to eat. The ensuing feast was not one to be forgotten any time soon: the alcohol flowed like the mighty Ynn and all the elves who gathered drank their fill and much more. By the time the sun rose the next day our mighty ruler lay passed out surrounded by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] loyal Oathkeepers."

So [ynn_levy_iosahar.Monarch.GetSheHe] has offered us a large number of men above [ynn_levy_iosahar.Monarch.GetHerHis] normal levy obligations to bolster our ranks. Accepting them would portray [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as such a weak monarch that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] needs to rely on the generosity of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects to win [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] battles.

This would give a chance for the rest of the [Root.GovernmentName]’s many subjects to enjoy the magnificent spectacle of fully equipped knights and their antler horses charging each other in a violent test of honor. Hosting a lavish tournament has the potential to improve our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s relationship with our many subjects, and ingratiate [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] with the common people. If it goes poorly however it can be expected to reflect badly on us, as we are the hosts of this tournament."

 ynn_authority_events.156.t:0 "Mediocre Jousting Tournament"

Their respective retainers and subjects have joined in on the brawl and turned our meticulously planned tournament into a massive embarrassment for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].

It was so routine and trivial that our ruler dealt with it so quickly [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had quite some time left before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had to leave. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] spent that time speaking with them all, especially those among them who were getting particularly angry at our benevolent rule.

[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] reputation is well known, to all but [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self at least, and as such in the interest of keeping our standing we keep our gracious ruler on an unfortunately tight leash. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] never walks too far away from our diplomats on official visits lest [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] say something that would cause an incident. However during a recent meeting between [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and the Iosahar [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] seemingly slipped away from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] handler. By the time we were able to get [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] back the damage was already done. We don’t know what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] said or did, but by the anger on our loyal vassal’s faces it must’ve been bad."

 ynn_authority_events.164.t:0 "A Solid Performance"
 ynn_authority_events.164.d:0 "Today’s race was fine. The Ynn was calm, the boats well made and the teams determined enough. As the canoes cut through the Ynn and towards the finish gradually one of the teams pulled ahead and crossed the finish line with time to spare. While there was some grumbling, the feast that followed drowned away all the sorrows the losers may have had.

 ynn_authority_events.165.d:0 "It started with an argument before the race even began. One team took issue with another for some reason and heated words were exchanged. It would’ve started a fight right there had our magnanimous ruler not intervened in time to soothe tensions. We figured that was the end of it, but we have been unfortunately proven wrong. During the race one of the slighted teams pulled up next to the other and began to push at their canoe with their paddles. The other team rapidly turned from rowing to pushing their attackers as well. Before long both teams were out of the race and focused entirely on capsizing the other.\n\nFinally one of them won out and the other team tumbled into the Ynn. At that moment a horrendous beast from the mighty River savaged the team, striking at the floundering men again and again and again before being driven off by nearby warriors with spears of their own. By the time the other team was back on shore it was found that two of the team had died and the other three were seriously wounded."

 ynn_authority_events.166.d:0 "Today the great canoe race was supposed to be held. We say "supposed to" because it barely even began. First all the teams, lords and all, showed up drunk and late. They brought with them canoes that looked like they were made by children the night before and two of the canoes fell apart before even touching the River.\n\n When the race finally began, it didn't even get to last five minutes before the shoddy canoes and drunk crews led to every single one of the teams crashing their canoes and sinking them. The soggy crews were then dragged out of the river only for them all to immediately blame the other teams for their failure, almost starting a massive fight. It wasn’t long before our mighty ruler, annoyed beyond compare, sent everybody home and canceled the feast. Hopefully the next race will be better."

 ynn_authority_events.225.t:0 "The Dam Pilgrims"
 ynn_authority_events.225.d:0 "Today a large group of pilgrims has gathered to meet with our ruler. They are asking for rights to set out on a pilgrimage towards a Great Ynnic Dam located outside our borders. These great structures, built by our ancestors long ago, help calm the Great Ynn and divert water to our fields and mills. As a vessel through which the Ynn passes, all of them attract a great many religious pilgrims.\n\nThis group seems well provisioned to get through our land, but who knows what will happen to them outside our borders. The dams are extremely important to our culture and letting a pilgrimage get robbed or worse may paint us in a negligent light among our vassals and people."
 ynn_authority_events.225.a:0 "Wish them a safe journey"

 ynn_authority_events.226.t:0 "Pilgrims Go Missing"
 ynn_authority_events.226.d:0 "It seems our group of pilgrims never made it. We have lost what little contact we maintained with the pilgrim caravan, and news have stopped coming about their journey. Long-distance travel across the Ynnic lands is a perilous endeavor even for experienced adventurers and it's not uncommon for pilgrims, usually not trained in the finer aspects of self-defense, to go missing.\n\nHowever their disappearance could hurt our ties to their hometown. Not only that, but assuming they were eaten by a Wendigo or fell victim to banditry, that makes the woodlands even less safe, and is a problem we may have to deal with in the future."
 ynn_authority_events.226.a:0 "May the Ynn bring their souls peace…"

 ynn_authority_events.227.t:0 "A Pilgrimage Arrives!"
 ynn_authority_events.227.d:0 "Our lands are fortunate enough to host one of the Great Ynnic Dams of the Ynnic Empire. These Dams not only divert water to our fields and help manage the Ynn when possible, they serve as religious sites for our people. Few proud Ynnics would die happy if they hadn’t seen at least one of the Great Dams at least once. That is what makes our control of one so profitable.\n\nMarket towns frequently pop up near the dams to serve the pilgrims and they are a valuable source of income. Not only that but the prestige from having one within our borders is also immense. In the end it's assumed that we will welcome these wandering souls from [From.GetName] with open arms so that all will know of our kindness and generosity. However, as important as they are, these dams are also valuable targets for military campaigns. What if these ‘pilgrims’ are simply spies in disguise?"
 ynn_authority_events.227.a:0 "Welcome one and all!"
 ynn_authority_events.227.b:0 "Send these saboteurs away!"

 ynn_authority_events.229.t:0 "The Failed Pilgrimage"
 ynn_authority_events.229.d:0 "Today a pilgrimage that recently set out from our lands to reach one of the Great Ynnic Dams has returned to us. However they return not in joy and religious ecstasy from seeing such a monumental sight, but in frustration, anger and sadness. It seems that the local ruler of [From.GetName] has decided to turn our poor pilgrims away at [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] gates. [From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] might suspect them to be spies or some other such nonsense.\n\nWhile the less religious among our courtiers have simply shrugged and moved on, a powerful force within our court urges our glorious ruler to not let this stand. If [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] did this once, [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] may do it again and no true ruler could ever allow such dishonor to stand!"

 ynn_authority_events.228.d:0 "Today a pilgrimage that recently set out from our lands has returned to us safe and sound. They come bearing stories of visiting the Great Dam and basking in its glory. They drank from the Dam’s massive reservoir, gawked in its shadow and felt the spirit of the Great Ynn pass through them as they visited the nearby town. They had especially good things to say about the local noble that rules the lands the Dam is on. They tell of [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] graciousness in allowing them through [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] lands and the safety that they felt on their travels through them."

 ynn_authority_events.300.d:0 "The rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been greatly appreciated by our Iosahar, and they have come to present their feelings of loyalty and gratitude. However, within their compliments lies a veiled message, for such a well liked ruler would be unwise to potentially elect out of office when the oaths of your subjects are bound to him, who can say if these bonds won't break if he is not re-elected? Can we afford to let disloyalty foster among our Iosahar by electing a different [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"

 ynn_authority_events.302.d:0 "The clergy approach you with documents and theological interpretations that claim republicanism cannot be overlord to Iosahar, as the constant inconsistency in rulership twists the purpose of the Iosahar's holy oath."
 ynn_authority_events.302.a:0 "Let them complain, surely few will listen"

It seems clear they either fled servitude, turned to banditry, or both. Regardless, they explained they are no longer welcome in their homeland and intend to stay here, but are more than willing to fight for us if we would accept them."
 ynnsman_events.1.a:0 "You're in the army now."
 ynnsman_events.1.b:0 "We have standards."

 ynnsman_events.2.t:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Diaspora"
 ynnsman_events.2.d:0 "Our nation was built with backbreaking labor and an unrelenting spirit, but it isn't for everyone. Many [Root.GetAdjective], rather than live a harsh life on the frontier, have entered the service of various feudal lords in the valley. They have established small communities here and there, and now many among our youth are considering joining them for better opportunities. They will send money back home, of course, but they are our best and brightest, and our country would suffer without them."
 ynnsman_events.2.a:0 "Wish them good luck!"
 ynnsman_events.2.b:0 "Maybe they could be convinced to stay?"

 ynnsman_events.3.t:0 "River-Priest Asks for Hospitality"
 ynnsman_events.3.d:0 "Our integration in the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] feudal system has been smooth so far. Only two parts of our contract with them are non-negotiable: we are to recognize them as the rightful ruler of the Ynn, and to give hospitality to any priest of the sacred river who asks for it.\n\nToday, [Root.Overlord.GetName] has informed us one such priest intends to travel through our lands. Any proselytism happening, they claim, would be on the priest's own volition. Our acceptance is a mere formality that they hope will be swift."
 ynnsman_events.3.a:0 "Tell them we accept, of course."
 ynnsman_events.3.b:0 "Tell them we accept, of course, but join a few glass coins to the letter."

 ynnsman_events.4.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Knighted!"
 ynnsman_events.4.d:0 "The first Cannorians to work for Ynnic lords were mercenaries; war is a universal language, after all. The practice expanded to include not only free companies, but also Cannorian auxiliaries, bodyguards and military advisors. Today one such person of [Root.GetAdjective] origin distinguished themselves and was awarded a minor title by their lord in thanks for an outstanding service.\n\nThis unusual event surprised Ynnic and Cannorian alike, but [Root.GetName] was talked about with respect in the ceremony, and our standing in the valley has improved as a result!"

 ynnsman_events.5.d:0 "A group of Ynnic knights riding their iconic antler horses has reached our border, claiming they are hunting down a group of outlaws and that they finally found their hideout, which is on our territory. They are demanding we let them enact justice, with thinly veiled accusations of us willingly harboring the bandits. Not only are these implications baseless - we can't control the actions of everyone on the frontier, after all - letting foreign soldiers hunt down no-gooders in our own land would greatly undermine our authority."

By technicality, they aren’t breaking any laws, as our edicts forbid the unlicensed production of guns on the land and on the Ynn, but say nothing about the production of guns in caves. However, this minutia of the law matters little to the nobility, who are demanding the kobolds be stopped from this underground activity, as any reasonable noble knows that an armed peasant is a recipe for disaster."

 ynnsman_events.103.d:0 "Many members of our court thought the inclusion of [Root.GetEventAdvisorName] among them was just an amusing experiment by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] at first, but [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHis] adaptation of Cannorian ideas to our Ynnic reality has brought great benefits to [Root.GetName].\n\nNeedless to say, our noble houses are not keen on questioning what they consider to be prestigious traditions dating back generations and have called [Root.GetEventAdvisorName] a foreign barbarian hell-bent on destroying our culture.\n\n[Root.GetEventAdvisorName]'s proposals are actually quite small in scope, and this is clearly a ploy of the [Root.GetNobilityName] to see [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHim] replaced by one of their own. Nevertheless, [Root.Monarch.GetName] will have to settle the situation. Do we favor skill or status?"

 ynnsman_events.107.t:0 "Company Captains Raise Issue With Equipment!"
 ynnsman_events.107.d:0 "The Cannorian mercenaries working under our government have been grumbling over our policy regarding weapon choice; they say that forcing them to drop their guns in favor of "medieval weapons" is causing the death of many more men than if they were fighting with the Cannorian style, which relies on wide-scale usage of firearms. Some of our most prominent generals have stated that allowing these men the use of guns would cause a general decrease in unit cohesion across the board, resulting from the use of two vastly different methods of war within the same army. It can be expected that this will not be a popular decision with the Cannorians which will make recruiting costlier and more difficult, however we will be left with the most orderly of the bunch. Other distinguished generals have argued that allowing the Cannorians to fight in their traditional style would drive more men to enlist, allowing us to pay much a lower rate than if we were to force our ways onto them."

Using the technniques of the Riverblades they form shimmering shields of water to cover their bodies. Then, they charge the enemy lines carrying explosives, which explode in the face of their opponents in blasts of fabulous confusion, shattering enemy ranks whilst the aquatic shields keep the Kobolds from harm. This tactic has given the Kobold company a bit of fame, with soldiers even dubbing them the "Riverscales", after the Riverblades who inspired their tactic. Some question the validity of a form of combat based on running at enemies with bombs, but for the moment none can doubt it functions."

It is certainly no place suitable for a knight, and yet they have petitioned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as they were beyond impressed by the local rodeo champion, a man going by the name of Auroch Aucyn.\n\nAccording to them, they saw him with their very eyes exhaust several wild Epednar horses, one of those bizarre purple horses with the explosive temper from the southern Expanse, and even a Veykodan wooly rhino, and made it look like it wasn't even a challenge. They claim no one can match his skill on a saddle in the entire Ynn and that he would make an amazing if very unconventional riding instructor."

 ynnsman_events.241.d:0 "The dining hall's festivities are interrupted by a sudden knocking. A human enters the (already open) door and confidently introduces himself as Walbert With, "the best alchemist you'll ever see north of the Cliffs". Then another human, raggedly dressed and with thuggish manners, reluctantly steps into the hall and is introduced as Iessíl Pírkmóine, younger companion of Walbert With and "trading associate" of his.\n\nSome in our court sneer at the unlikely contrast between the alchemist's grim seriousness and the trader's lowly ways, and our guards ready their weapons as precaution. Normally we wouldn’t even consider inviting such individuals anywhere near our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], however our currently-employed Natural Scientist, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName], has gone to great lengths to sing the praises of Walbert With and vouch for him. Unfortunately for our Natural Scientist, no one else in the court has heard of "Walbert With" before.\n\nOnce the sneering subsided [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] nervously explained that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has brought these two here because he believes Master With to be very knowledgeable when it comes to alchemy and wishes to learn the trade [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim]self. "Master With" then piped up, as if someone asked, and said that he refuses to work in [Root.Capital.GetName] without his companion Pírkmóine, who he assures us is as renowned. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] then stares at the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] pleadingly, obviously looking for a way out of this humiliation. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] then says:"

Through Walbert With’s death in a street brawl over territory, it was discovered that he was the alchemist in charge of brewing the "Diohúis" plum moonshine. Iessíl Pírkmóine was responsible for organizing the distribution of the product, and as an advisor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] he used his credentials to avoid goods transport inspections, allowing them to operate unhindered.\n\nBut with the death of Walbert With, the whole thing fell apart and in some kind of odd retribution Iessíl Pírkmóine killed Walbert's predecessor, the reason is still unknown. This killing caused Pírkmóine’s involvement to be exposed, forcing him to flee: he was last seen heading northwest past the Ekyunimoy Mountains to serve some mythical "Winter Court". This situation has left the [Root.GovernmentName] in a bind, our people are blaming humans as a whole for this incident and demanding their persecution. However, members of our administration are pointing out the lack of oversight over senior officials as the source of the problem and suggesting reforms to reduce corruption."

It’s no literal battle but instead one of contracts, and we have been given the opportunity to take a side, as a band of Half-Orc mercenaries have requested a contract for service and settlement rights in [ynn_horc_mercs_prov.GetName].

Rune enchanting, practiced by Veykodans, and spell enchanting, brought by Moon Elves. Rune enchanting is a less intricate craft, cheaper to apply but requiring maintenance more often, making it the more appealing option for use in massed warfare, whereas spell enchanting focuses on providing long-lasting enchants which require minimal maintenance but an elaborate process to create, making it the favourite choice of our mounted nobility."

 ynn_buycev_events.1.d:0 "Today the Buycev, the warlike nomads who inhabit the fringes of the Ynn River yet refuse to acknowledge Ynnic civilization and religion, have launched another of their incessant raids into our lands. They struck fast and hard, aiming for a small village near the border. However they got so caught up looting our lands that they failed to notice the nearby garrison marching out to meet them in battle.\n\nThe fight was hard and there were casualties on both sides but in the end the Buycev were forced into a retreat, leaving much of their stolen goods behind. While the victory will not bring back those we were too late to save, it will ensure the Buycev stay away. From here at least, and just for a while."

He has apparently heard that we are rivals with the rulers he intends to soon raid, and has offered us a cut of the spoils if we contributed some gold to his cause.\n\nWhile some advisors have suggested we take them up on this offer, others are less than excited. Firstly and most importantly, it's a nearly savage thing to do. Not only to use such an underhanded method to undercut a rival, but to rely on Buycev to do the dirty work as well only makes it worse. One of the few things that unites all the Ynnic peoples is the hatred of the Buycev. To sick them on a rival for a momentary leg up is a low move."

I stared from the parapets as a decrepit Veykodan, covered head to toe in tattoos, glowing red with pulses of blue, hobbled into the town square on a cane and waited. He took a deep breath, and his tattoos started glowing. At first, it was one beam of energy: the people around him looked on in astonishment and got closer. But more came from the Veykodan, and these ones were blazing hot, dozens of twisting streams of red and blue emanated from that vile Veykodan, spreading out in all directions and making terrible crackling sounds as the air itself boiled from the heat.\n\nThe town and its panicked residents were enveloped by this creeping barrage. The lucky ones, the ones directly touched, were turned to ash in an instant, the others perished in the ensuing fire. My own clothes were set ablaze in the chaos, but I remembered the stream close to the parapets, below a small bluff. I ran for it and dove, passing out. I was awoken by the sound of howling wind and blazing fire, and raised my head above the bluff to see that the whole town had been consumed by flames, with that decrepit Veykodan hobbling around on his cane, admiring his handiwork as he checked for survivors! Thankfully the bluff hid the stream from his sight. Sometime later he left with some Veykodan woman supporting him in his hobble."\n\nThe governor’s account of what happened was chronicled and spread. Now our citizens are demanding we find this Veykodan, dubbed "the Scourge of [Root.Province.GetName]", and have him tortured to death for his crimes.

He was already gravely ill before he went to [rune_mage_raid_prov.Province.GetName]. He would have been dead within 2 months, but your despicable act made my father's blood boil. He made it his mission to see your people pay, so they would feel tenfold the suffering we went through.

The commander requests ten thousand strong able-bodied men to find the vicious Wendigo and see it slain. The young knight, Sir Galindan, suggests our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should hunt the wendigo on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own. Galindan then unprompted, presumably to accentuate his point, begins amusing the congregation with Ynnic legends of yore:\n\nHe tells the tale of the Malacnari Battleking Vatrevid Roosgevit, who tired of his subjects being slain by Wendigos and so he gathered his warriors and slew countless numbers of the beasts, so much so that the monsters did not dare approach Malacnar for a hundred years! Not to be outdone, the Antler-Lord Privyldha of Stantirvare had his guards strip bare, carrying just their swords, single-handedly slay a wendigo to prove their worth to him and become full-fledged riders! And of course, the half-mad knight Yanobnik Stretocvytrie, who when returning home from a jousting tournament spotted a pack of wendigo attacking a band of travelers, couched his lance and charged, skewering three of the beasts in a single stroke!\n\nEven if Galindan’s tales are most likely apocryphal, they do hold some truth, the people respect a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who will fight for them."

The sight made many of the general’s men retch, the mutilated body stared at them lifelessly with a single eye, full of terror.\n\nAfter the men composed themselves they attempted to sneak up on the beast. A twig was snapped before the men could form up around the animal. The wendigo turned its head away from its meal in a fluid motion and screamed in a guttural howl, less than a second later the three soldiers closest to the beast were slain. A mad dash ensued as the beast sprinted through the forest, realizing it was outnumbered; our soldiers chased it with reckless abandon. The wendigo turned many times to strike its pursuers, leaving them grasping at the gaping holes in their necks.\n\nEventually, some organization was restored, and luckily the beast had run itself up against the side of a sheer cliff. The general quickly capitalized on this and had his men form a large circle around the beast trapping it. With much thrashing, many broken pikes, the death of an officer and a few soldiers who had not kept their distance, the beast was finally slain, dead from a thousand cuts. There was no celebration, however, for no glory was won, the only thing forged here in the woods around [Root.Province.GetName] was nightmares for these soldiers who would never forget this horror, they would eternally thank their predecessors for making these beasts a rarity within the Ynn."

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] regaled the congregation assembled at [Root.Capital.GetName] with how [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] tracked down the beast and interrupted its feeding. How it then set upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in a lightning-fast attack for interrupting it, leaving a large dent in [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s helmet, which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] proudly presented to the congregation as a badge of honor.\n\nThen in fine detail how [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] traded blow for blow with the wendigo crippling its leg and being ferociously struck in the chest in return for maiming it. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sliced a digit off of a claw, hurting it to the quick and causing the beast to spurt blood and yowl in agony. Eventually the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] won the battle as the wendigo swiped at [Root.Monarch.GetName] it was left open, they each struck each other, however, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s heavy armor protected [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] from the worst of the wendigo’s savage blow, allowing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to slip [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword under the beast’s rib cage and finally put it down for good. \n\nNow that the beast was dead [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] collected the claw and made a pendant from it. Never to miss a good opportunity our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] ensured that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] account of the battle would be distributed through every town in the realm, artist rendition of the dented helmet and claw pendant included of course."

 ynn_buycev_events.183.d:0 "The hunt has failed, it's been over a month and the only thing we have found is the bleached white bones of our citizens and our dead soldiers, no wendigo in sight. However the beast remains at large in the province and our colony is seeing dozens of its residents vanish, only to be found later, their carcasses picked clean, the only thing remaining being their scratched bones."
 ynn_buycev_events.183.a:0 "I’m sure it’ll leave eventually."


 ynn_buycev_events.184.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] Found Dead"
 ynn_buycev_events.184.d:0 "After two weeks without word from our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a search party was formed to look for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. It took a week of combing through the woods the wendigo has been plaguing to find the refined set of armor our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was wearing when they set off, now battered and soaked in blood. It was found many meters from [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s bones, picked clean by the wendigo. The only thing clearly identifying the body as specifically [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s was the gilded and gem-studded ring found among the finger bones bearing the blood-splattered lettering reading "[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]". The [Root.GovernmentName]’s citizens feel no sympathy for their previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], if anything they feel resentment, for their supposedly wise leader went off on a suicide mission which ended predictably poorly, leaving the [Root.GovernmentName] in a state of disarray."

 ynn_buycev_events.185.d:0 "A Veykodan with a set of glowing magical tattoos, unaccustomed to Cannorian gambling games, was convinced by the proprietor of the [veykodan_tavern_brawl.Province.GetName] colony's bar to partake in a game of shell. The Veykodan was soon distraught, as he had lost every play except the first one, leaving him with empty pockets. Someone more well versed in Cannorian gambling tapped the Veykodan on the shoulder and informed him that he was being cheated. The Veykodan’s tattoos started to glow, as he threatened the peddler and claimed that the entire town would be leveled if his money was not returned to him.\n\nThe peddler, obviously unaware of the threat posed by Veykodan magic, ignored him and started to argue. The proprietor attempted to diffuse the situation but it was too late, as our colony was blessed with a new bar-sized smoking crater, with an unamused Veykodan standing alone in the center of it, holding a heavy coin purse. The Veykodan was allowed to leave the city, as no member of the garrison dared to challenge him after that display. In the aftermath of this peculiar event, we are left with a frontier town lacking a bar, which is a recipe for disaster, as many of [veykodan_tavern_brawl.Province.GetName]’s residents, citizens or otherwise, have come to rely on drink, without which they can be expected to get quite rowdy."

If the "murderer" is not turned over within 3 months, he has promised that a great war host will descend upon our colony in [Root.Province.GetName], seeking their retribution through blood. The citizen accused has denied all responsibility claiming instead that the [buycev_site_from.Culture.GetName] chieftain killed his own father in a bid for power, then blamed him for it to avoid being seen as a kinslayer."
 ynn_buycev_events.188.a:0 "Like I need more problems. Just hand him over!"

We will send parties to clear out ruined waystations before our engineers can repair them or build new ones from scratch, paths will need to be beaten again, and communities will need plenty of encouragement to move in; we will no doubt face stiff resistance from Veykodan tribes, or worse still, ambushes by Wendigos hiding among the trees and ruins, which is why our efforts must be carried out with the maximum alert."
