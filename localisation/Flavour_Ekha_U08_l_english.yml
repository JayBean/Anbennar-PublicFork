 flavour_ekha.0.t:0 "The Silver Tarnish"
 flavour_ekha.0.d:0 "It was two years ago when $MONARCH$’s predecessor, Amsakas (insert name) opened the gates of the city to Viakkoc and pledged servitude to them, two years since we began sending our own to die in the pyres of the kult, two eternal, soul wrenching years, seeing our kin in Khasa being worked to their deaths and shipped off as slaves; in the midst of this situation the republic finds itself in a state of utter chaos unlike any we’ve experienced before, factionalism is rampant and our state is in no way prepared to face the turmoil of these last years.\n\nWith the ongoing civil war in Kheterata raging in the east we have heard whispers of a possible betrayal from the gnolls in Brrtekuh and the recent moves by our overlord seem to corroborate this story, this may be our last chance to throw off the gnollish yoke and regain our freedom, we have little time to act in any meaningful way.\n\nSeeing the dire situation the republic is in and fearing the worst should the gnolls perceive further weakness in our states, the various holy orders remaining in Ekha have united in a push, led by the Maddakas, they’ve invoked one of their ancient rights to force a re-election, this is a highly unorthodox move and the Shukkhan, Bhiahan and Akrohan will no doubt try to repel their attempts of reform. $MONARCH$ is working with borrowed time, but that is all we can ask for now."
 flavour_ekha.0.a:0 "The Silver Republic still hasn’t drawn its last breath!"
 flavour_ekha.1.t:0 "A Planar Offer"
 flavour_ekha.1.d:0 "The leader of one of the holy orders of the coalition has come before $MONARCH$ with an interesting proposition, she will lend the full strenght of the Desati Sisterhood to the state in exchange for future privileges, and she insist on a preemptive strike against Viakkoc. This is gainst the laws that have maintained impartialty among the holy orders for a century, and would be in direct contradiction with the aspect of resilience, but considering the situation and the grat boon this could be all doubts are cleared from $MONARCH$'s mind, only one question remains, one they know the answer to"
 flavour_ekha.1.a:0 "What is one more broken oath?"
 flavour_ekha.2.t:0 "The Broken And The Defiant"
 flavour_ekha.2.d:0 "Today one of our spies has managed to contact a member of the Khasani resistence in Viakkoc, we were pleased to discover that it was none other than the governor of Khasa, supposedly a puppet under gnollish control, though that seems to be far from the truth considering the transcription our spy has send us\n\n I can still hear her screams sir, she was a girl so full of life just 8 years of age, ready to spread her wings, and they took it from her, in front of my eyes, in front of the Mother’s eyes. The thing that came out of her… It cackled, Sir, it asked them to let me live, said that I was little more than a broken puppet ready to be propped up as a scapegoat and sacrificed. Now I must return to my post as “governor” and play my part in this demonic dance; they see us as little more than puppets, but we still have our teeth and talons, soon this farce will come to an end."
 flavour_ekha.2.a:0 "Storms Take Them"
 flavour_ekha.3.t:0 "The Lion Offers Aid"
 flavour_ekha.3.d:0 "A diplomat from the kingsom of Busilar has decided to “grace” us with their pressence today, the disdain in his says is clear and yet his words are soft and measured, he says that Busilar may grant Ekha a chance for redemption in exchange for some comercial privileges; the conditions of the deal are outrageous and would certainly eliminate our grasp over the flow of commerce in the Divenhal, and yet, are we in a possition to deny aid and bite the hand that feeds us?"
 flavour_ekha.3.a:0 "In times like these one must swallow their pride"
 flavour_ekha.3.b:0 "We won't change gnollish chains for Cannorian ones"
 flavour_ekha.4.t:0 "Plunge the knife"
 flavour_ekha.4.d:0 "The day has come; the moment of our final vengance is near and the curs of Viakkoc will learn that we are no pushovers, an overwhelming attack at our darkest hour is what it took to break us, we will strike these demons down in their apex"
 flavour_ekha.4.a:0 "And we won't even break a sweat"
 flavour_ekha.5.t:0 "Free From Demonflame At Last"
 flavour_ekha.5.d:0 "It is done, the curs of Viakkoc have been driven back and akasik has been reclaimed, now the little princeling of Khasa knocks at our door, asking for his birthright back, he is young and ambitious and could prove to be a liability in the future, should we keep him despite the risks?"
 flavour_ekha.5.a:0 "The throne is lawfully his"
 flavour_ekha.5.b:0 "His family was unworthy of this title, the Khasani deserve better"
 flavour_ekha.6.t:0 "Sins Of The Kult"
 flavour_ekha.6.d:0 "even if the leaders of the kult have been killed some warlord upstarts still roam our lands, it only takes one crazed kultist to strat yet another catastophe, we lost everything once and we will not suffer to loose it again, we cannot let any demonic stench linger under the Mother’s shadow, chase them to the blasted desert they came from and kill any who fall behind; the few that flee and scape from our grasp..."

 flavour_ekha.7.c:0 "to the colonies with the lot of you"
 flavour_ekha.8.t:0 "Demands Of The Prince"
 flavour_ekha.8.d:0 "Aur-Kes-Akasik, the pride of our people and one of, if not the most important placein all of Akasik religiously, the Khekhasa dynasty has historically held the palace in recent memory and before the colapse of the kingdom Bhasal was the rightfull heir to the palace, however the deshaki have seized it ever since Viakkoc invaded and now claim dominion over it, arguing that they were the ones that kept it safe"
 flavour_ekha.8.a:0 "The Deshaki managed to defend it against the scourge, they've earned it"
 flavour_ekha.8.b:0 "It is righfully his after all"
 flavour_ekha.8.c:0 "Who better to hold the palace than the restores of Akasik?"

 flavour_ekha.13.a:0 "We need to take care of the nobles"
 flavour_ekha.14.t:0 "Reform Merchants"
 flavour_ekha.14.d:0 "Only the merchants remain, with their actions they have sullied the republic's honour, they forget that the council is more than something they can puppeteer, no matter, we'll bring them remembrance"
 flavour_ekha.14.a:0 "We'll bring them justice"
 flavour_ekha.15.t:0 "Reform Rich"
 flavour_ekha.15.d:0 "With the nobles and the merchants dealt with only the urbanites remain, arguably the most bening of the 3 factions, but be it as it may a tumor is still something to be excised"
 flavour_ekha.15.a:0 "And excise it we will"
 flavour_ekha.16.t:0 "Cross Examination, Nobles"
 flavour_ekha.16.d:0 "What to say of the Shukkhan, the nobility of Akasik, most presume of their Crodamic origins, they have grown decadent and petty. Fond of their privileges granted to them by Sedoric I himself, they shield themselves with these priviliges while plunging our state into turmoil because of their petty conflicts; but they are not untuchable, no one is"
 flavour_ekha.16.a:0 "It is a leason we must teach them"
 flavour_ekha.17.t:0 "Objection, Rich"
 flavour_ekha.17.d:0 "The Akrohan are perhaps the least noticable but most insiduous element of the tarnish we are suffering, they are like vultures, flying up above any trouble aloof in their own world, only coming down to feed on the works of better men. They leech on the hard work of our people and leech off of the systems ideated to help them to grow their riches"
 flavour_ekha.17.a:0 "bring them down to earth, and show them what they get for thinking themselves better"
 flavour_ekha.18.t:0 "Pursuit, Merchants"
 flavour_ekha.18.d:0 "The Bhiahan are little more than traitors, of the worse kind; they shield themselves arguing that they did everything for the republic and for a good cause, their excuses are weak, and every Ekhasi sees them for what they truly are, monsters, sending their own to die to gain even a modicum of attention from their masters, they have almost been our doom."
 flavour_ekha.18.a:0 "and we do not forgive easily"
 flavour_ekha.19.t:0 "Free of rot"
 flavour_ekha.19.d:0 "The three factions have been thrown out of power and the republic is restored to its previous glory, a new balance of power has been set and new measures have been taken to avoid the erros we commited on the past."
