 escanni_wars.1.t:0 "The Escanni Wars of Consolidation"
 escanni_wars.1.d:0 "War has come to Escann. These are not the scattered skirmishes to which the Escanni have grown accustomed, but war as was practiced before the Greentide. The sound of town criers and haggling merchants will soon be replaced by the gruesome, destructive cacophony of cannonfire.\n\nFor some Escanni, the horrors of war offer financial opportunity: the number of adventurer captains offering themselves to the highest bidder has risen dramatically, and there is no shortage of veteran soldiers willing to join these mercenary armies."
 escanni_wars.1.a:0 "War is a grizzly affair."
 escanni_wars_tt:0 "§YCombatants in major Escanni wars will gain access to mercenaries from beyond Escann.§!\n\nThe §YWar of Consolidation§! Casus Belli becomes §Gavailable.§!"
 
 escanni_wars.2.t:0 "The Wars of Consolidation End"
 escanni_wars.2.d:0 "The wars that ravaged Escann saw a great increase in adventurer captains selling the services of their mercenary armies. As the conflict has evolved into a broader Cannorian struggle, these mercenaries have become less relevant to the military strategies of great powers. The era of private armies in Escann is coming to an end."
 escanni_wars.2.a:0 "Fight not for gold, but for experience."
 escanni_wars_end_tt:0 "§YMercenaries from beyond Escann will no longer be available.§!\n\nThe §YWar of Consolidation§! Casus Belli will be §Rdisabled.§!"

 castonath_wonders.1.t:0 "Imperial Apartments Finished"
 castonath_wonders.1.d:0 "While much of the Imperial Palace is usable, if we are to base our center of power around Castonath the Splendid Court considerable renovations have to be done across the palace grounds itself and nearby buildings in the Upper City. The Imperial Apartments will eventually house the majority of the nobility of the realm and any who wish to gain the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s favour."
 castonath_wonders.1.a:0 "Your new home awaits!"
 
 castonath_wonders.2.t:0 "All Roads Lead to the Splendid Court"
 castonath_wonders.2.d:0 "Castonath was once the heart of humanity, and the heart of all civilization.

 castonath_wonders.3.t:0 "Old Bazaar Tenements Dismantled"
 castonath_wonders.3.d:0 "For much of recent history the Grand Bazaar was known as the 'Old Bazaar', one of the roughest slums in Castonath. Through a combination of bribes, incentives to move out and military force, we have managed to clear much of the old tenants, as well as dismantle any new addition they had to the complex. Now the real work begins, renovating and repairing the ancient structure itself."
 castonath_wonders.3.a:0 "Get out of here!"

 castonath_wonders.4.d:0 "Fanfare and crowds gather as [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] cuts the ribbon to re-open the Grand Bazaar.\nCustomers from across the world have come to regale at the renovated structure: a massive complex that can house over a hundred shops and stores, all inside and safe from the elements. While only the core of the Grand Bazaar has been filled by an initial set of businesses, many more commercial suites will soon become available to rent and hold commerce."
 castonath_wonders.4.a:0 "Business is Booming."
 
 castonath_wonders.5.t:0 "Dragonforge Ruins Cleared"
 castonath_wonders.5.d:0 "When the Greentide struck down the gates of Castonath the Balgarsmiths held out for over a year atop the Dragonforge and its adjacent crenellations. Eventually, however, the orcish threat was too great and the Balgarsmiths set the Dragonforge, destroying much of the original foundry and structure to prevent it from being used by the orcs.\nNow that we have cleared the destruction and rubble from its wake, we can finally get around to restoring the inner workings of the forge."
 castonath_wonders.5.a:0 "They really did a number on this one."

 castonath_wonders.6.d:0 "Combined with the latest innovations in metallurgy whilst still respecting the original dwarven design, the flames of the Dragonforge can once again be seen across the Castonath skyline. Thousands of smiths, crafters and even artificers flock to the forge and its surrounding neighbourhoods. One of the first production lines in the Dragonforge has already sent out its first batch of mass-produced weapons, ready for use by the armies of [Root.Owner.GetName]."

 castonath_wonders.10.d:0 "Castonath is a large city. A city built for a continent-spanning empire, and as such many parts have still yet to be fully excavated and resettled to this day. In [Root.GetName], we came across an undiscovered tribe of orcs squatting in them. Upon being discovered, they killed the work crew and have begun to rampage across the district!"

 build_splendid_court_desc:0 "In 1670s the Kingdom of Núrcestir renovated the crumbing Imperial Palace of Castonath and in under a year it became the seat of government. Eventually, the vastly influential royal household moved in and opened its doors to any courtier and noble willing to enjoy the grace of the crown. This allowed Núrcestir to consolidate the state while the nobility were distracted with splendid balls and parlour games."

 build_grand_bazaar_desc:0 "The Grand Bazaar was a huge indoor marketplace at the centre of the Lower District of Castonath. At the height of Castan's Empire it was filled with vendors peddling goods from the farthest reaches of empire and beyond - to a point that many goods hailing as far as Yanshen could be found there. By the Late Castan's Empire much of the Bazaar was repurposed into a sprawling slum - but a few patricians still have the old schematics ready for use if we should be in a position to restore it to its original glory."

 castonath_dragonforge:0 "The Dragonforge"
 desc_castonath_dragonforge:0 "One of Balgar the Builder's wonders, the Dragonforge once produced the arms for the legions of Castanor. The Dragonforge is a massive foundry that sits on one of the natural hills of Castonath (long covered by stone). At the top of the forge itself is a massive dragon's head that can be seen spewing fire when large shipments of metal are melted."
