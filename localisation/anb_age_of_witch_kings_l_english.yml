 escanni_wars.1.t:0 "The Escanni Wars of Consolidation"
 escanni_wars.1.d:0 "Escann has known many forms of war over the millennia, which have left its land well-watered with blood. There was Castan II Beastbane's crusade against the Deepwoods, which turned vast forests into ash and slew countless centaurs, satyrs, and other Fey creatures. There was the War of the Sorcerer-King, when new elven might clashed against the powerful magics of Nichmer and his acolytes. And of course there was the Greentide, which crushed historic nations into rubble, proud peoples into refugees, and great cities into ruins. But it has never known war like this.\n\nThis will be no crusade, no fight of 'good' against 'evil'. This is war of brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor. There is no war more violent, no war more vicious.\n\nSoon, a land which only recently began to again hear the sound of Tellum town criers will find it replaced by the gruesome, destructive cacophony of cannonfire. The engineers responsible for rebuilding Castonath and cities across the land shall turn to the design of new fortifications and artillery.\n\nNot all Escanni dread the horrors of war, however. In tall towers and great palaces, Witch-Kings imagine themselves rivals to Nichmer himself, soon to ascend over all Escann, nay, all Cannor (but of course, any such conquest must begin with §RCastonath§!). Vertesker and Nathalairey merchants are already delivering the latest weaponry from Telgeir and the Dragon Coast as they come to pick up Orcish slaves. And, of course, the number of adventurer captains offering themselves to the highest bidder has risen dramatically, with no shortage of veteran soldiers willing to join these mercenary armies."

 escanni_wars.2.t:0 "The Wars of Consolidation End"
 escanni_wars.2.d:0 "The War of the Sorcerer-King ended with the climactic Battle of Trialmount. It was a ritual appropriate to the times: a tournament of men and elves selected a handful of the most prominent figures in Cannor to ascend the mountain, take its trials, and slay Nichmer. A few died in the tournament, many more died in the ascent — but ultimately, taking up §OCalindal, the Gleaming Blade§!, Clarimonde of Oldhaven slew the dark mage and ended his reign.\n\nBut these are not those times. Honor, chivalry — these are all words whose meaning has decayed in the centuries since those great deeds. The Escanni Wars of Consolidation do not end with a tournament, indeed, they do not end with any particular event at all. That may be how history used to go, but it is not the nature of our present chaos.\n\nPerhaps the land finally is saturated with blood, and can take no more. Perhaps the soldiers are spent, generations left on the battlefield. Perhaps it is just the sight of [escanni_wars_victor.GetName]'s [escanni_wars_victor.Monarch.GetName] standing in Castonath's tallest spire, proclaiming to all the start of a new era. Whatever it is that future historians point to, right now, we know only this: the Wars of Consolidation are over. And, at least for the briefest moment, there will be peace."

 escanni_wars.3.t:0 "A New Power in Escann"
 escanni_wars.3.d:0 "Castanor began as a small power, centered on the fledgling city of Castonath. Castan the Progenitor was a local warlord at best, even if he had The Wayguide seer to help him, and was sufficiently talented to unite the Castanites behind him. And then, within a generation, Castan II 'Beastbane' was leading a crusade against the Deepwoods. A few more generations, and Castanor stood dominant in Cannor, only rivaled by the Gnomish Hierarchy and the Damerian Republic.\n\nIt seems another power in Escann has followed that path: [Root.GetName]. Rising from the ashes of the Greentide, by diplomatic dealings and military might they have rapidly secured control over a vast swathe of the region. Their rule over Escann is now incontestable, even if some pockets still resist them.\n\nOne question remains: what shall they do next. Shall they follow the footsteps of wise Castan IV 'Realmbuilder'? Bloodthirsty Castan IX 'the Quarreler'? Or will they be inspired more by Nichmer, the Sorcerer-King? Only time shall tell."

Out of petty adventuring bands and relic-kingdoms we have created a power that dominates all Escann, and those few corners of the realm which still resist our rule shall fall soon enough. The Wars of Consolidation are over, and we have won.\n\nNow it is time for us to expand our gaze, our ambition. Where shall we look next?"

That the people of the Dameshead might unite, might choose peace over war, prosperity over bloodshed.\n\nBut even from the beginning, that peace was laced with lies. Held together only by mages' might, it quickly devolved into the Wars of Rule. And then the Lilac Wars, first, second, third and fourth. Now, it seems, one more such war has ended. A new Emperor takes the Dove Throne, a new dynasty to add to all those who have contested it over the centuries.\n\nIn Anbenncóst, [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is presented with crown and scepter, the same once held by Riannón Silmuna, the same once held by Lothane síl Wex III. The Electors look on; they all know their fate if they would object. The Emperor's first order of business is to declare the Emperorship hereditary, never to leave the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] line. [Root.UsurpEmperorDynasty]\n\nAnd so a new chapter in the history of Anbennar, the history of all Halann, dawns."

Joyous tedium, of course, for under [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule, [Root.GetName] now stood atop all of Escann, but tedium nonetheless. No more sleepless nights, obsessing over army movements and frontlines. No more stressful meals, wondering whether an enemy mage would carve through the magical defenses and burst into the room in a lightning bolt of destruction. With a mind free to wander, [Root.Monarch.GetName] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] thinking about Castanor, the greatest and first human empire on Cannor, often. How could anyone live up to its legacy?\n\nWithout the responsibilities of war, [Root.Monarch.GetName] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] spending more and more time strolling between the marble busts and stone statues of Castonath's Pantheonway. The relative silence of the district, employed by many as a refuge from the constant shouts of merchants and low murmur of conversation of the rest of the city, was instead deafening to [Root.Monarch.GetName], letting untoward thoughts and doubts rush in unimpeded. Doubts, of the nature of rulership, of the direction of [Root.GetName], amongst others. And so, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sought wisdom and insight while walking between forever-frozen scenes of Castans past.\n\nHow did these near-mythical figures forge Castanor into a continent spanning empire?

 escanni_wars.21.t:0 "The Abandoned Trials of Castan"
 escanni_wars.21.desc:0 "The answer to the greatness and longevity of Castanor, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had come to obsessively believe, were the mysterious Trials of Castan. Many specific details are vague, perhaps lost to the vagrancies of time, but accounts do agree on a few points. The Trials were a tradition started by Castan II 'Beastbane', seeking to follow in the Progenitor's footsteps. After summiting the Trialmount as Castan the Progenitor did, Beastbane added his own trial for every future Castan to complete, and so the tradition continued, with each successive Castan adding their own challenge to the mix. Only by proving one's worth in the ever more complicated Trials could one prove oneself worth of becoming the next Castan.\n\nAll this ended with War of the Sorcerer-King and the final Battle of Trialmount. It is said by many that the magical energies and destructive forces wrought by the battle forever tainted the Trialmount. At the very least, the battle rendered the mountain inaccessible for years after the battle. Stories of still-active magical traps, pockets of dark energy, and even echoes of ghostly appearances of the Sorcerer-King himself kept most out of the area, even as Castellyr and Escann started to consolidate and prosper in the centuries after the war. For the average person, the Trialmount and the Trials of Castan have long faded into history, banished from the public conscience by events since such as the Greentide and Wars of Escanni Consolidation.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] was not satisfied. Surely, some of the Trials would have survived. Surely, centuries of time would have dissipated the worst of the remaining dangers of the Trialmount. And most importantly, experiencing the Trials would surely open [Root.Monarch.GetName] up to the insight and wisdom of the greatest Castans, just by following in their steps!\n\nIn the meantime, Trialmount was overgrown. Glory Road was in disrepair, many of the paths leading from and to the disparate Trials had been swallowed by the hungry roots of trees, and the North Citadel was still a shadow of its former self without the old aqueduct feeding it. Before any could attempt the Trials of Castan again, they needed to be reclaimed from time and the wilds. While this was happening, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could devote all of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time to pouring over ever last detail of each of the Castans and preparing for the trials."

Before [Root.Monarch.GetName] could get too excited, however, a small contingent from the Castonath patricians, having gotten wind of the completion of the restoration, approaches. Certain patrician factions and families are more protective of Castanorian history and legacy than others, and this was clearly from one such family that took enormous pride in tracing their line directly from the very first Castanites. Proud and haughty as always, they quickly make their intentions known: they wish to dissuade [Root.Monarch.GetName] from attempting the Trials. They warn [Root.Monarch.GetName] of the dangers posed by the Trials, of the consequences of reigniting such a tradition in modern times, and above all, of soiling the legacy of Castanor. According to them, only those descending from Old Castanorian blood can rule, meaning that only those who share the blood of the original Castanites can become Castan. They cite the Proclamations of Castan, which states the following:\n"Henceforth all those that have followed and endured with me shall be known as MY people: Castanites - and our realm's successors will be of your blood and your blood alone."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] dismisses this out of hand of course, for had not the proclamation been broken by Castan Ebonfrost and his successors, who were all Gerudian?"

First, it was Castan the Progenitor and his campaign against the gnolls, after which he went on to unify Escann for the first time. Then, later came other Castans, which all kept expanding the borders of Castanor outside of Escann. Years of peace and stability followed the expansions, but they did not last forever. First came the several Wars of Dominion, where the Gnomish Hierarchy, the Damerian Republic, and Castanor, fought several wars amongst themselves. Then at 470 AA came the Dragonwake, wherein dragons awoke and Escann fractured for the first time since it was united under the flag of Castanor. In the year 978 AA, Nichmer the Sorcerer-King enthralled the last emperor of Late Castan’s Empire, which during the time under Gerudian rule came to be known as Black Castanor, and following the ensuing War of the Sorcerer-King, Escann was shattered into many different polities.\n\nThe complete collapse of Escann came under the banner of Dookanson and an endless mass of orcs swarming down from the Serpentspine which ravaged the few states of Escann that remained. Only the death of Korgus Dookanson at the hand of Corin managed to break the tide and give Escann another chance. The fighting did not cease though, and instead of conflict with the orcs, the adventurers now also fought amidst each other to carve out new nation-states for themselves and their bands.

Eventually, the vastly influential royal household moved in and opened its doors to any courtier and noble willing to enjoy the grace of the crown. This allowed Núrcestir to consolidate the state while the nobility were distracted with splendid balls and parlour games."

 build_grand_bazaar_desc:0 "The Grand Bazaar was a huge indoor marketplace at the centre of the Lower District of Castonath. At the height of Castan's Empire it was filled with vendors peddling goods from the farthest reaches of empire and beyond - to a point that many goods hailing as far as Yanshen could be found there. By the Late Castan's Empire much of the Bazaar was repurposed into a sprawling slum - but a few patricians still have the old schematics ready for use if we should be in a position to restore it to its original glory."

After the fall of Castanor the Order of Balgarsmiths, the crafter-priests who worshipped Balgar made it their home until the Greentide when the order destroyed much of the forge to prevent it being used by Korgus Dookanson's war machine."

The Dragonforge is a massive foundry that sits on one of the natural hills of Castonath (long covered by stone).
