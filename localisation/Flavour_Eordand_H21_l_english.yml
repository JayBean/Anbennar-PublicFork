 eord_1_vanbury_guild_title:0 "Protecting Nature's Sanctity"
 eord_1_vanbury_guild_desc:0 "Even from beyond the horizon, the stench of soot irritates us. Defiling Tor Nayyi, the Vanbury Guild has torn down the forests and burned them for fuel for belching furnaces. Worse so, the seasons themselves buckle at their wasteful ways, being perverted into unnatural events.\n\nNo more! Their wanton destruction will end, by our blade and arrow and magic!"
 eord_1_rezankand_title:0 "Extinguish Burning Crusade"
 eord_1_rezankand_desc:0 "Far to the south in South Aelantir, the Dawn Elves of Rezankand have carved a blazing path through Taychend and beyond. Our Ruinborn cousins have been robbed and murdered, all in the name of their all-mighty Sun God! Surael, the false god, will be torn down for his mockery of the comforting warmth of Summer!"
 eord_1_herbs_pixie_dust_title:0 "Herbs and Pixie Dust"
 eord_1_herbs_pixie_dust_desc:0 "Eordand has long been saturated in magic even from before the tumultous events that destroyed the Precursors long ago. Wondrous flora and fauna are found throughout the land, varying wildly even between hill and dell.\n\nDruids and mages have long prospered from these bountiful reagents, often casting magical spells to wage ware against each other. But now Eordand is united - where once our resources were spent fighting amongst ourselves, now the blessings of the Fey Lords can be used for our prosperity!"
 eord_1_secure_sarmadfar_title:0 "Secure the Sarmadfar"
 eord_1_secure_sarmadfar_desc:0 "Gouging into North Aelantir, the Sarmadfar has always glimmered brightly in the Summer's sun and moonlight. A sea of prosperity, sailed by opportunistic merchants, but sought by jealous lords and plundered by the independent Caamasi Merchant Lords.\n\nBy Ealar the Mariner, the sea shall be ridden of these dregs so that commerce may be truly free - under our control!"
 eord_1_stargazers_title:0 "Stargazers"
 eord_1_stargazers_desc:0 "Beyond the glare of the Sarmadfar to the south lies a land always seen, but yet never known by Eordan civilization. An arid and hilly land, far from the Domandrod, there has been little reason for the Caamasi to travel to such a location when they could simply sail to thriving ports elsewhere.\n\nDespite this, these lands show promise to Eordand: a great vantage point to watch for greedy foreigners. Unlike how the native Fograc watch the stars of the night sky for reasoning in their meagre lives, we shall bring meaning to this land as a first defense of Eordand from the south."
 eord_1_edge_of_world_title:0 "Over the Edge of the World"
 eord_1_edge_of_world_desc:0 "While Caamasi merchants have sailed south to Alecand for centuries, the western seas have always been a dangerous mystery. Known to us as Murdfaibh, these frothing seas seemed to extend in an endless expanse of blue towards the horizon, until now.\n\nBeyond Lismel, the archipelago of Farsenn and Sardach extend further west than was previously thought. But before searching for where the sun sets, Farsenn and Sardach must be made ours, for with them we find our way back home."
 eord_1_what_lies_beyond_title:0 "What Lies Beyond"
 eord_1_what_lies_beyond_desc:0 "Sailing past Farsenn and Sardach is a world beyond! At first a few small islands, soon a great maelstrom of storms obscuring our path in one direction, and a great land even further past. Met with hostility at first, due to our elven resemblence, our explorers can glean little information from this exotic land.\n\nFinding themselves in the tropical clime of Arawkelin, a city with many half-elves, the Eordan are met with a warmer reception. They tell of lands even farther west and south! What wonders will be found even still?"
 eord_1_restrain_artificers_title:0 "Restrain the Artificers"
 eord_1_restrain_artificers_desc:0 "The Artificers of the Haraf, be they goblin, gnome, or kobold, all have one thing in common: an intellectual ambition that is contrary to the teachings of the Fey Lords. The proper way of Artificery is to respect the art of magic and the laws of nature, working with it instead of bending it to a purpose.\n\nWe cannot allow them to continue their destructive arts: we must teach them our wise ways, by force!"
 eord_1_explore_deserts_title:0 "Exploring the Haraf Desert"
 eord_1_explore_deserts_desc:0 "A dreaded landscape hardly better than the desert to the north, inland Haraf at first glance offers little of value. Were it not for the Precursor relics that are scattered throughout Aelantir, this land would be of little use to Eordand. But search it we must, for the teachings of our ancestors must be retrieved from their earthern vault!\n\nThe Ruinborn of these lands, the Haraf'ne named after their land, cling to ancient waterworks of the Precursors that once brought life to these lands. Only with our expertise can they be restored."
 eord_1_restore_flow_title:0 "Restoring the Lifeflow"
 eord_1_restore_flow_desc:0 "Covered in wind-blown sands, the irrigation canals of the Precursors are in long disrepair. Only a few carry but trickles of water that the Haraf'ne treasure more than gold.\n\nBut as we have done so before, so can we do so now: we will bring life back to this land! Comprised of highly complex enchantments, Precursor mechanisms may be understood by our Druids who have long since mastered the ways of nature and artifice. It only takes an investment to bring life back to this dying land."
 eord_1_ruined_circle_title:0 "Into the Ruined Circle"
 eord_1_ruined_circle_desc:0 "An eternal reminder of the demise of the Ruinborn, and consequently our introduction to the Fey Lords, the great Ruined Circle is edged by sheer cliffs. Within the Ruin relics are sparse and often deep buried beneath the earth, as if all of the Precursors was demolished and buried. Nevertheless, this land is both cursed and blessed: powerful and terrible magic permeates this land.\n\nMany colonies of the eastern invaders are found within the Ruin, founding island and coastal communities from where they fell the woods and steal our legacy. If we are to drive off these invaders, Eordand must establish itself a point of strength from which to gather. Jutting into the sea, a mighty spit weathers the Ruined waves, guarding a harbor within. We must not squander this opportunity that Fate has given us!"
 eord_1_bloodstained_altars_title:0 "Bloodstained Altars"
 eord_1_bloodstained_altars_desc:0 "While Eordand is sworn to defend Aelantir and the Ruinborn, some have tempted their salvation. Namely, the Cheshoshi of the Reapers Coast have performed barbaric acts in name of their Death Cult. Sacrificing en masse, they have even managed to waste the lives of those slain, not even using their soul or body for magical use, simply left to rot!\n\nThe Reapers Coast must be seized and shown the wisdom of the Fey, for we cannot afford this stain on the reputation of the Ruinborn to persevere!"
 eord_1_center_of_ruin_title:0 "Center of the Ruin"
 eord_1_center_of_ruin_desc:0 "The heart of the Ruined Circle lies deep beneath the ocean, with only rocky islands as the blasted remains of the grand capital of the Precursors. Perched on the rocks like scavengers, but ignorant of what is buried beneath, all manner of thieving pirates and demon-worshipping gnolls desecrate the living tombs of the Precursors.\n\nNo more! Their graves will be guarded by our fleets and protected with our magic, and if they recognize our authority over the Ruined Sea then they may be given a chance to correct the error of their ways."
 eord_1_apprehend_thieves_title:0 "Apprehend the Thieves"
 eord_1_apprehend_thieves_desc:0 "Endralliande, strangely deserted of Ruinborn, has become a hive of the foreigners and a springboard for their theft of Aelantir. While the interior woodlands are mostly untouched, it is too late to end their settlements and plantations and the trade that they have established across the seas.\n\nIn our position of strength we must seize the gateway to Aelantir and assert our jurisdiction over Aelantir!"
 eord_1_cousins_sun_moon_title:0 "Cousins of Sun, Moon, and Elm"
 eord_1_cousins_sun_moon_desc:0 "During our reclamation of Aelantir, many denizens claiming to be descendants of the Precursors were found, slender of frame and with pointed ear but from seas apart. Before the appearance of the eastern thieves, the Eordan thought of ourselves as the only survivors of the Precursors, with the other Ruinborn being of further decay from our gloried past. But now - doubt strikes us, for these people live for many times our lifetime and have maintained magical traditions despite the teachings of the Fey!\n\nA wispy peace hangs over Noruin, and many have discussed the true nature of these foreign elves and their relation with us. Divergent theories clash in the lecture halls and symposiums across Eordand, with some declaring friendship with the elves, and others dismissing them as mere pretenders. Calling themselves Venaanists and Aldanists, after great figures of the Precursor Empire, these debates have manifested themselves into ever-feuding political parties. Perhaps it is time to reach out to the Elves from across the sea to learn what they may reveal about our home, so that our home may decide a path instead of bickering."
 eord_1_venaan_title:0 "Venaan's Teachings"
 eord_1_venaan_desc:0 "Ages ago, Venaan founded the first Precursor Empire, breaking free from the crushing grasp of the dragons. The elven race was free at last, and built the wonders and majesty of Aelantir. Spectacular art, floating cities, even rumours of venturing to the stars!\n\nAs the Sons of Venaan, we are all siblings, despite our divergent history after the fall of his empire. Let us work together with our family, and let them home if they wish."
 eord_1_aelathraithe_title:0 "Aelathraithe"
 eord_1_aelathraithe_desc:0 "A paradise on Halann, but still only a faint glimmer compared to what once was. The Sons of Venaan have embraced together, Ruinborn and Elf, working together to rebuild what once was. Laying brick by brick, nurturing seedlings into great trees, restoring ruined arts - only with the children of the Ruin and with the undying ones may we bring back what made our home perfect...\n\nIn the pale moonlight dancing across the parapets, reciting ancient poems to melancholy harp strings until the sun rises again - one can almost dream that our goal is complete..."
 eord_1_valley_of_thousand_lights_title:0 "Valley of a Thousand Lights"
 eord_1_valley_of_thousand_lights_desc:0 "Bathed in everchanging lights - pure awe fills your heart! Shimmering, flickering, shining off the perfectly warm water! The lights reflect off the uncountable leaves, mystifying flowers fill the air! One could stay forever, floating on one of many giant lily pads. Fairies dart in the sky, a wonderful sight!\n\nOne might worry they may be here for malice not pleasure, but everyone knows that in the Valley of a Thousand Lights all are friends!"
 eord_1_bliss_unending_title:0 "Bliss Unending"
 eord_1_bliss_unending_desc:0 "Basking in the warmth of the sun, cooled by a scented breeze, the glades touched by Summer are forever the perfect day. Feeling warm, you jump off your canoe into the water, diving deep into the clear waters and swimming between iridescent schools of fish. Breathing in the water comes naturally to you - Summer is as much the depths of the ocean as it is the warmth of the sun!"
 eord_2_istranar_title:0 "Misguided Paladins"
 eord_2_istranar_desc:0 "While their intentions may have been noble, the paladins of Istranar threaten all of the Ruinborn. Straying from the true intentions of their firey-haired goddess, they sought to extinguish evil in Aelantir, namely the Dragon Cult of the Rzentur. But they are gravely mistaken, for they only murder and cause misery when all should be diligent to the Fey Lord's will."
 eord_2_neratica_title:0 "Legions of Death"
 eord_2_neratica_desc:0 "A stark contrast to the knights of Istranar, Neratica's legions have always been blackened by evil. Truly outcast from their noble brethren across the seas, these so-called holy warriors have brought battle to the Cheshosh Death Cult.\n\nWhile that faith is detestable, Neratica goes beyond merely defeating evil: they have always disregarded our kind as scum! Should their lord of death exist, they will regret following him, for there is no noble afterlife for the sins they have committed!"
 eord_2_alchemical_security_title:0 "Alchemical Security"
 eord_2_alchemical_security_desc:0 "While having a nearly endless supply of reagents is a great boon to the alchemical arts, a standard way of practicing the art is lacking. What good are experiments if each alchemist may prepare theirs with vastly different tools, altering the results of the process?\n\nInspired by a classical spell used to clean food from poisons and toxins, glass and woodenware have been enchanted to be sterile and unreactive. However, only the highest quality materials will do - rare wood from the Domandrod, Frozenglass from Egstrel - with these, we can achieve much to relearn the knowledge of our ancestors!"
 eord_2_glorelthir_title:0 "Glorelthir Unity"
 eord_2_glorelthir_desc:0 "Perhaps the best preserved of Precursor Eordand, the Glorelthir coastline has long been a center of rebirth. Cradling the Spring Court, they have done much to relearn the lost magical and scientific arts of the past, but in their pursuit of knowledge the clerics of Arakeprun became obsessed with their studies.\n\nThe Glorelthir was ripped apart in civil war, with those in Elchos rejecting the all-demanding authority of the Arakepruni scholars. And long have the Kairncalan boasted of their part in the victory against Pelodan the First. If we are to truly let Eordand bring the past to the future, the Glorelthir must be united and quarrels ended."
 eord_2_past_haraf_title:0 "Past Haraf"
 eord_2_past_haraf_desc:0 "South past the great desert of Haraf is a vast land studded with humid jungles and vast expanses of warm grassland, filled with Ruinborn who sadly have not sought the wisdom of the Fey and remain ignorant of their Precursor legacy. Rivers flow from the desert deep inland, draining the land of precious water.\n\nWater in great excess fuels abundant growth by the coasts, which invaders from across the seas wish to exploit! Eordand must protect our legacy and our Ruinborn brethren: Haraf must be secured!"
 eord_2_silence_cacophony_title:0 "Silence and Cacophony"
 eord_2_silence_cacophony_desc:0 "A twisted mockery of true magic! Belching smoke and spewing forth acids and pollutants, the coasts of Haraf have been claimed by so-called Artificers. All small, some green, some scaled, and others with a supreme ego - they all have stolen lands from the Precursors and have tainted it with their experiments. End their boisterous clanking, so that the woods may be as silent as the Watchers before!"
 eord_2_urdea_samrad_title:0 "[GetEordandUrdeaSamradMissionTitle]"
 eord_2_urdea_samrad_desc:0 "[GetEordandUrdeaSamradMissionDesc]"
 eord_2_urdea_samrad_title_a:0 "Urdea Samrad"
 eord_2_urdea_samrad_desc_a:0 "Where the Haraf rivers empty into the sea, a great city will be built, a beacon of Eordan civilization bringing light to this tainted land. Buried beneath the sands of the coastline, an ancient Precursor artifact tarnished by the sea has granted us this vision. But something is different about this, unlike what we have found before: it is unmistakable that the sea had dragged it onto these shores from beyond...\n\nLong ago the Caamas had intended to settle this land, honoring the Sun and Summer, but their foundations have been torn down for the squalid huts of the artificers. Urdea Samrad will be restored, not only to restore natural balance, but also as a grand capital for the southern marches of Eordand."
 eord_2_urdea_samrad_title_b:0 "Strengthen Urdea Samrad"
 eord_2_urdea_samrad_desc_b:0 "Where the Haraf rivers empty into the sea, a great city will rise, a beacon of Eordan civilization bringing light to this tainted land. Buried beneath the sands of the coastline, an ancient Precursor artifact tarnished by the sea has granted us this vision. But something is different about this, unlike what we have found before: it is unmistakable that the sea had dragged it onto these shores from beyond...\n\nUrdea Samrad, once our greatest pride, has regrettably fallen into neglect after the unification of Eordand. Urdea Samrad will be restored, not only to restore natural balance, but also as a grand capital for the southern marches of Eordand."
 eord_2_urdea_samrad_title_c:0 "Strengthen Deagran"
 eord_2_urdea_samrad_desc_c:0 "Where the Haraf rivers empty into the sea, a great city will rise, a beacon of Eordan civilization bringing light to this tainted land. Buried beneath the sands of the coastline, an ancient Precursor artifact tarnished by the sea has granted us this vision. But something is different about this, unlike what we have found before: it is unmistakable that the sea had dragged it onto these shores from beyond...\n\nDeagran, once our greatest pride, has regrettably fallen into neglect after the unification of Eordand. Deagran will be restored, not only to restore natural balance, but also as a grand capital for the southern marches of Eordand."
 eord_2_watching_lovers_title:0 "Watching the Lovers"
 eord_2_watching_lovers_desc:0 "As far as the eye scans, churning seas separate us from the lands to the south: to the east is naught but desolate deserts and wild jungles. These lands will certainly be reclaimed for Eordand and the Precursors, but of far more importance are the seas themselves.\n\nFor on the eastern seas is the Ruined Sea, heart of Aelantir and locus of the foreign thievery. And to the south has been revealed a darkened isle of soot, the artificers of Haraf but children compared to the Vanbury Guild who squat on Tor Nayyi. We must guard our lands against these threats: our ships will patrol the Lovers' Pass, watched by the garrison on lonely Arpoláil."
 eord_2_isle_steel_smoke_title:0 "Isle of Steel and Smoke"
 eord_2_isle_steel_smoke_desc:0 "Marring the horizon with black smog from their furnaces, the Vanbury Guild has despoiled Tor Nayyi in their quest to steal the Precursors' knowledge. They stop at nothing to uncover their secrets, tormenting our Ruinborn brethren, tearing down the forests for fuel, and even have forayed into our realm to steal from us!\n\nThere are few who disgust us more, nay few more evil than these men of steel and smoke. We will not abide this destruction of Aelantir - tear their forges and laboratories down, until the coal piles are reclaimed by nature."
 eord_2_promises_prosperity_title:0 "Promises of Prosperity"
 eord_2_promises_prosperity_desc:0 "Bathed in the nourishing warmth of the Sun, the islands of the Ruined Sea show great promise. Steeped in latent magical energy, often manifested as corruption, with our power we can reverse this, using the folly of our ancestors to fuel the growth of the flora.\n\nImagine - vast fields of crops so dense as to be a forest, granting us such prosperity! Seeking such, many Eordan have sought to live on these islands, becoming one with Summer's warmth."
 eord_2_aldan_title:0 "Aldan's Path"
 eord_2_aldan_desc:0 "The Precursor Empire was plagued with war, and Aldan its last king fought to the bitter end to protect it. While the true reasons for the war have been lost to time, it is known that once the Precursor Elves had left Aelantir to settle the world beyond. Seeing the folly in this plan, upon Aldan's ascension to the throne he had called all Elves back home, declaring that Aelantir is their true and only home.\n\nFollowing Aldan's path, many have urged that Eordand should not only reclaim Aelantir, but that we are the only true Elves! The impostors from across the seas have lost their claim, having fled from their own disaster and leaving us behind to rebuild!"
 eord_2_foranaela_title:0 "Foranaela"
 eord_2_foranaela_desc:0 "War is but a spoke of the wheel of life, bringing death so that others may live. Eordand naturally is rightful in waging war, bringing death to the invaders and impostors who have stolen our birthright!\n\nAs Aldan once ruled all of Aelantir, so shall we. It shall be Elven once more, and where our ancestors once walked we will retake.\n\nWhether it be the cruel ice sheets of the north, or the endless jungles of the south, all of Aelantir is ours. When the day comes that our homeland is reclaimed, we may rest, but until then may our enemies know our wrath."
 eord_2_warmth_growth_title:0 "Warmth and Growth"
 eord_2_warmth_growth_desc:0 "Infused with the seasons of Spring and Summer, the Arragglac and Sarmadglac fill our hearts with anticipation and glee! A veritable paradise, promised to us by the Fey Lords, that we can return to. From sweet bogs filled with buoyant giant flowers, to dazzlingly dancing lights that illuminate a valley of blossoms and crystals, to warm amber fields lit by magnificent light-beams that pierce through the canopy - where else would you live?"
 eordconq_4_obscuring_shadows_title:0 "Obscuring Shadows"
 eordconq_4_obscuring_shadows_desc:0 "Truly the darkest corner of the Deepwoods, where scarcely does the Sun even glance the canopy of the forest, the glade of Ghul hosts shadows darker than what can be seen. The elves of Ghul have long been known to be secretive and practice macabre rituals in secret to the Unseelie, who have granted them dark boons.\n\nBut now, the forest of Ghul lies under orcish hands, who skulk in the dark with the same ease as they did within the great mountains around. The Fey Lords of the Domandrod, from each of the courts, urge us to reclaim the shadowed woods so that the orcs may not inherit the dark boons of their Elven predecessors."
 eordconq_2_green_squatters_title:0 "Green Squatters"
 eordconq_2_green_squatters_desc:0 "Having invaded both the Domandrod and the Deepwoods, the vile orcs and goblins have shown their hand as true enemies of the Seasons. They have no place in Aelantir or the Deepwoods.\n\nLet us be rid of them, out of sight and out of mind, whichever way possible. Let them return to their caves from which they came - especially the twisted Emerald Orcs who have made progeny with heretic Fey!"
 eordconq_2_eye_to_eye_title:0 "Eye to Eye"
 eordconq_2_eye_to_eye_desc:0 "A stunted people like ourselves, but in stature as opposed to longevity, the dwarves of the Serpentspine Mountains have endured a similar history to ourselves regarding the Orcs and Goblins. They too have long fought them, and have lost many holds to them, ever ready for a fight to reclaim what is theirs.\n\nAlthough they hold little regard to the Wood Elves, their pernicious neighbours, some have acknowledged our campaigns against the brutish invaders with appreciation. Besides, their caves and underground realms are not compatible with our nature, being far from the winds and nourishing sunlight. Perhaps an agreement may be made with our underground compatriots, to further combat our mutual foes?"
 eordally_2_secure_outskirts_title:0 "Securing the Forest's Edge"
 eordally_2_secure_outskirts_desc:0 "The outskirts of the Deepwoods may be thick and uninviting to the point of deterring entrance to most, but there are a few paths to gain entrance. These Gladeways have long been patrolled by the Wood Elves, but now they are vulnerable to attack from outside.\n\nWithout our aid they will surely be defeated once again by any number of enemy, be it orc again or the upstart humans. Eordand will restore their natural borders if they cannot do so for themselves."
 eord_3_aelnar_title:0 "Ultimate Evil"
 eord_3_aelnar_desc:0 "There are many foes who have invaded Aelantir, some intent on stealing the riches of the Precursors and others on a self-righteous mission to conquer in the name of their god or ideological mission. But none are as depraved as Aelnar, their bright star a dark void. They claim they are the true inheritors of Aelantir, the only true elves - the Ruinborn not even a stain on their promised legacy, murdering our people with zeal and even fueling their incantations with our souls!\n\nOf all the invaders, Aelnar is the true evil. If only one can be defeated, let it be the Aelnar and all the lesser evils prevail!"
 eord_3_marrliande_title:0 "Illuminating the Shadows"
 eord_3_marrliande_desc:0 "Within the Trollsbay whispers of dark magic spread from town to town, of individuals drained of blood to the point of death. The stately manors of Marlliande oversee great plantations, with the planters shaded well beneath their spacious porches.\n\nWhile others are hesitant to investigate into this vampiric threat, to Eordand it is clear that they are hiding a dark secret. We do not fear the night - we will plunge our blades into their cursed flesh with no fear!"
 eord_3_ironhunger_title:0 "End the Ironhunger"
 eord_3_ironhunger_desc:0 "For all of recorded history, Eordand has long suffered from a lack of iron ore, relying on copper and tin for bronze tools and arms. While it is servicable, and has indeed helped us rebuild our homes since the fall of our ancestors, the qualities of iron and steel have always outshone bronze. From time to time, warriors outfitted with rare iron have seemed nearly gifted with magical advantage, enduring blow after blow of bronze sword and spear \n\nBut Eordand is now beset with invaders who fight equipped with iron and steel. We cannot afford to be stuck in the past."
 eord_3_break_copperlords_title:0 "Break the Copperlords"
 eord_3_break_copperlords_desc:0 "A relic of when copper and bronze reigned supreme as the preferred metal, the Copperlords have still maintained their economic and political power, still plagueing us with monopolies and economic sabotage.\n\nWe still have great need of these resources, especially with the production of modern artillery. There is no place for wasting infighting: the Copperlords' influence must be crushed once and for all!"
 eord_3_eordan_artificery_title:0 "Eordan Artificery"
 eord_3_eordan_artificery_desc:0 "While the rest of the world has begun to view magic as simply a tool, Eordand knows that the mystical properties of magic are not to be underestimated. For our Precursor ancestors built a great empire and many wonders with purely magic!\n\nOthers simplify magic into artificial rulings as if it were a subsection of engineering, a fatal flaw. Our artificers are mages as well, skilled in its applications by understanding the nature of magic, not a codebook of applications. For Artificery is magic, not a science."
 eordspring_3_gardening_title:0 "Gardening"
 eordspring_3_gardening_desc:0 "To prepare for the future, you must sow the seeds yesterday. For centuries the Spring Court has followed this doctrine, ever investing in the future, not just in crops but in mago-scientific research in Precursor artifacts and great works gleaned from this knowledge.\n\nWe must not slack in our preparations, for another age dawns upon us. Let us plant the seeds of the future now while we still can."
 eordspring_3_full_blossom_title:0 "Full Blossom"
 eordspring_3_full_blossom_desc:0 "Our efforts in the past have brought great reward, but the true value of wealth is in how you use it. Like the mighty city of Arakeprun, rebuilt from the ruins of the past, we must use the fruits of our harvest to provide for future prosperity, not hoard over our riches in stagnation."
 eordspring_3_dawnfire_academy_title:0 "Dawnfire Academy of Botanical and Precursor Studies"
 eordspring_3_dawnfire_academy_desc:0 "The hero of Arakeprun who saved the city from the Goldtree Rebellion, Filnar Dawnfire was not primarily a warrior but a scholar. Skilled in many fields, from magical to botanical and archeological studies, Filnar Dawnfire guided Arakeprun into a new age of scholarship and learning following his ascension as Scarbag. Known for his experiments with Conjuration, he successfully summoned forth damestear meteors and established a center of research to understand this magical substance.\n\nIt is only fitting that his name be remembered for all ages in the name of the Filnar Dawnfire of Botanical and Precursor Studies."
 eordsummer_3_secure_shores_title:0 "Plying the Waves"
 eordsummer_3_secure_shores_desc:0 "A relaxing day, sailing the Sarmadfar bathed in the warming sunlight. Like Ealar the Mariner, we sail across the seas of the world, searching for new lands and new opportunities. But not all of Eordand shares our love of the seas - many have only trod beneath the land-bound trees. Let us introduce them to our beloved pasttime, so they may see the glory and beauty that is Summer."
 eordsummer_3_deal_with_merchant_lords_title:0 "Deal with the Merchant Lords"
 eordsummer_3_deal_with_merchant_lords_desc:0 "We have grown much since our early days as competing city-states. In our early days we relied upon ocean-bound vagabonds as mercenaries, known as the Merchant Lords.\n\nBut now our coastlines stretch across Eordand, with many ports and shipyards from which to supply from, and most of all unity of Eordand. In these times, is it necessary to still have these outlaws who flaunt our authority?"
 eordsummer_3_solstice_title:0 "Institute the Solstice Navy"
 eordsummer_3_solstice_desc:0 "While the Sun at high summit warms us, it always sets, but even at night the Moon illuminates us in her pale light. But for the darkest of nights, there is always light in the world to guide us forth.\n\nSo too shall Eordand be present across all of Aelantir and beyond, with ships sailing the coastlines so that the light of the Sun and Moon may both be guiding our way forward. The Solstice Navy will ensure that forever the Sun and Moon are ever aligned."
 eordautumn_3_eternal_discipline_title:0 "Eternal Discipline"
 eordautumn_3_eternal_discipline_desc:0 "The march of rows of boots and gleaming of copper-clad warriors have ever been the way of the Autumn Court. War has always beset us - the heretics of the other seasons have ever threatened our existence. There has never been a time that we could afford to rest. But now Eordand is united under our leadership, there are naught but partisans who only break the monotony of peace... \n\nNonsense! Get back to the march, I want your footsteps in unison, your armor perfectly shining, and your spears sharpened! You can rest once the leaves have fallen and Winter is upon us!"
 eordautumn_3_preparation_long_winter_title:0 "Preparation for the Long Winter"
 eordautumn_3_preparation_long_winter_desc:0 "Winter - our oldest and most hated enemy - still yet threatens us, despite the Snecboth heretics having been pacified! Frozen lands are wasteland, forcing us to huddle for warmth inside our homes. It deprives us of wealth, and starves us of sustenance. But these ills are not exclusive to Winter - from beyond the seas invaders have plundered our land and murdered our people!\n\nIt is clear that like Winter, this is a threat that will never cease - we will weather this threat until the end and beyond!"
 eordautumn_3_centralize_legions_title:0 "Centralize the Tuathak Legions"
 eordautumn_3_centralize_legions_desc:0 "While our legions have fared well against the Cannorian invaders, our greatest flaw is our prideful, but archaic, organization. Competing against each other for glory and fame, and even rewarded with bountiful gifts from the lower ranking legions, this tradition has soured into pointless infighting that has weakened the cooperation of our legions.

Along our eastern border the Armonadh mountains have long separated us from the East - where the enemy comes from - where a jagged and rocky coastline stretches along their base to the north.

But for traditional warfare, it is not very practical, being more brittle than common bronze.\n\nThrough our studies on Precursor metalcrafting, we have gleaned a small portion of how they smelted and cast metal in the past. One such process may reshape the mineral ore, after which they melt it with extreme force. But our mages have discovered a new technique: the mineral ore can be arranged into the desired shape, and from there repeatedly transmuted and quenched in leaden solution.

But they are fractured, split due to each desiring the great privilege and power of raising the great dragon Varlengeilt from infancy.\n\nThe Rzentur realms are our first real test in uniting Aelantir: our Ruinborn brethren do not all wish our protection.

But so too are others drawn to the cold wasteland and the milder lands, drawn by both lures of Precursor riches and the rumors of gold in the mountains.\n\nWe cannot afford to let an expedition set forth while we cannot guarantee their safety against rival bands: the borders of Dalaire must be secured for a forward camp."

 eordand.3.t:0 "Demands of the Domandrod"
 eordand.3.d:0 "With the conquest and destruction of Pelodard, the Domandrod Fey have lost their most loyal subjects. A message arrived in your palace in the midst of the night upon your table, written on a curious silky paper and with gracefully curving script. Despite the beautiful penmanship and sweet words, they are outraged by your actions, demanding your presence and explanation for your actions. Their call is not one to be denied. \n\nYou travel from Arakeprun with a small entourage, ready for the long journey to the Domandrod. You pass from the grandeur of Spring Court cities to the hinterlands in the east. Here the trees grow thick, and civilization sparse. Watching from above on the treetops, the Peitar look at you accusingly. Your loyal guards look around suspiciously with polearm and bow ready in hand, primed for threat to your person. But harm never comes to you, and before long even the homes of the Peitar dissapear into the deep forest of the Domandrod. The air is still and the glades calm, but all feels as tense as a drawn bowstring. Your journey is not over yet, but in this moment you hesitate and ponder over yourself. What is it you truly want, what is guiding your actions? It cannot be a mere whim that you wake every day, every day that you command the fates of countless souls? \n\nYou command your caravan to stop for a rest by a small spring glistening from the sunlight that has pierced through the twilight of the Domandrod. While the camp is set up you walk over to the pond with your personal guard Nestrin. You gaze into the still but clear water disturbed only by placid butterflies, you gaze into your reflection and truly realize who you are. \n\nThen you see in the reflections of the water an enchantingly beautiful woman draped in vines and a crown of rose thorn. Turning around, you see a monstrously huge man with a grotesquely horned mask, like a mass of antlers in every direction. The woman speaks to you with an unnerving smile. \n\n"What have you seen in the pool? Not all who enter the forest come here, but those who do always have a guilty conscience. I know that you are a leader most powerful, that your every word is one that carries great weight. So tell me, O great leader, what words will you say today? What will you say to justify your crimes?"

Clutched in its tenebrous hands you see a small but wickedly shaped dagger. \n\n"Are you prepared to answer for your crimes?," a graven, solemn voice utters.

Along the coast of Letih, fishermen found tiny glimmering clasts of some mineral compound among the sands some hundred years back. In my silken nightrobe I roused the court, and ordered an investigation into this legend. True enough, after extensive dredging of sand, more of these substance was found: none other than Damestear itself. But most importantly, the source was found, a buried ruin beneath the sands. Inside a long forgotten chamber was used by the Precursors to summon forth Damestear into our very own land. Although the art long defunct, the latent power of this facility can still be utilized to extract some Damestear, as long as energy still remains."

 eordand.9.d:0 "Dating back centuries ago to Pelodan the First, the Oathsworn dynasty has been beholden to reunite the Eordan peoples and end the seasonal heretics. Swearing an oath to bring back the heretics to the Fey Lords, Pelodan the First lead the united Peitar people on a holy crusade. He failed in his mission, and confidence was forever lost in the Oathsworn, leading to even the Peitar peoples splitting off into different states. Since then, Pelodan's descendants have clung to the past glory and infamy attached to their name, nostalgic of a victory that could have been.

Sidpar has struggled against the Summer Court realms, and would do well to gain an advantage against them. Should we offer them a deal, offering them support in eradicating the Summer heretics of Dearktir? Or should we simply demand the land, in their weakness they may not be willing to turn down any alliance with us."

 eordand.11.d:0 "Colltin is a ruined forest beset with rot and hated abominations from continued warfare in previous years between Pelomar and Sidpar. There is one quality that lifts it above worthlessness: the Colltin is the last area of land before entering the forbidden Domandrod. All Peitar feel a deep connection with the Domandrod and the Fey; Sidpar enjoys this connection, but our cousins in Pelomar have been long severed from the Domandrod. Now that our wars have ended and we are now allies, and we realize the pain that we have caused on our cousins, we should consider our ownership of the land. Pelomar offers us acknowledgement of our supremacy over the realms of the south along the Sarmadfar, including support in war against the heretic Caamasi, in exchange for Colltin. Should we accept this offer?"
 eordand.11.a:0 "Their terms are favorable: hopefully they will honor our claims."

 eordand.15.d:0 "At last, we are connected to the beating heart of our people, the Domandrod! Sidpar made the wise decision by entrusting us with our rightful land, and most generously asked nothing of us in return!"

 eordand.16.t:0 "Colltin Purchase - Demand Refused!"

 eordand.17.d:0 "With the surprising arrival of the foreign ships from the far east, many have discussed what should be done. There are those who suggested that we invite these foreigners to a banquet, hold a traditional autumn feast for them to gauge their intentions. Still, some are more interested in their advanced ships and tools, and suggested that we acquire some of their knowledge. There are even some who suggest that they are a threat to us, and must be dealt with. They turn to you for your decision."

 eordand.18.t:0 "A Most Unfortunate Feast"
 eordand.18.d:0 "Our explorers have traveled far and wide across Aelantir, discovering lands that would never have been believable before. On a recent expedition, the lands to far west have been discovered past the Broken Isles, inhabited by Ruinborn more advanced than others before. These Ruinborn approached our ships with advanced vessels of their own craft, and hailed our explorer captain to stop and rest at their fine home. The Ruinborn were quickly understood, as our shipboard scholar on Elven language was able to interpret them well enough. Calling themselves the 'Tuathak,' and the land 'Eordand,' they welcomed us to a banquet held in our honour. More alike the familiar elves than the other Ruinborn, we were quick to trust them. How wrong we were. It appears that we must have slighted them somehow, as our food was poisoned, and our ships seized. It is only by my own luck was I able to escape such a place and return to tell of this treachery, m'lord."
 eordand.18.a:0 "Treachery across the seas, are you sure our rivals aren't behind it?"
 eordand.19.t:0 "Fate of the Fograc"
 eordand.19.d:0 "The south coast of the Sarmadfar, once desolate but for the migrative Fograc, is now studded with Eordan colonies scraping the arid land. Despite our efforts, it is clear that the land will never be fully developed without considering the status of the Fograc. Having left us long ago before the schism of the seasons, the Fograc have abandoned the values taught by the Fey Lords and instead foolishly revere the stars. Some of the faithful have declared that the Fograc should be forced to repent for their transgressions, while others have stated that there is no reason to antagonize them."
 eordand.19.a:0 "Let us welcome the Fograc as equals."
 eordand.19.b:0 "They have abandoned the teachings of the Fey Lords before: that must not happen again."
 eordand.19.c:0 "For they are few in number, let us not concern ourselves with them."
 eordand.20.t:0 "Ancient Lifeblood of the Haraf"
 eordand.20.d:0 "After many years of excavation, research, and repair, the ancient Precursor qanats of Haraf have been repaired to a functional state. Where once was a bone-dry valley with nary a hint of greenery poking through the gravel, fresh water flows from one of the many channels, growing a verdant oasis. Pleased with the results, work was to begin to irrigate the rest of Haraf were it not for a particular concern: once activated, research on the Precursor machinery would halt. \n\nWith chambers flooded and complex enchantments activated, the facility becomes too dangerous to experiment with, and the risk of breaking the technology looms overhead. The chief mages and druids of the project wish to keep the facility in an experimental state, promising that the knowledge gleaned will be invaluable and far exceed that of restoring flow to the Haraf."
 eordand.20.a:0 "Haraf shall be reborn with water flowing once more!"

 eordand.21.t:0 "Discourse with Distant Family"
 eordand.21.d:0 "From across the sea they arrived, representatives of Moon and Sun and Wood. The representatives of Star have sent no delegation and no response, thinking themselves above any interaction with Ruinborn or their cousins. Arriving in Endralliande, the elves returned home to Aelantir at long last, a contrast to their flight long ago during what they call the 'Day of Ashen Skies.' Situated around a table outside with the salty breeze of the sea all around them, the Eordan and Elves discuss matters of their worlds: past, present, and future. They tell of their history, of the Day of Ashen Skies and the Remnant Fleet and the arrival to Cannor and Bulwar and beyond. Of wars and peace, of marriages and betrayal, and a longing to return home.\n\nWe tell them of the perils of Aelantir after the disastrous events, of the rebirth of Eordand and its long struggle to unite. The Eordan knew of other people in Aelantir, but did not know of the Elves who had sailed eastward. While the Ruinborn live short lives, the Elves live many centuries. Our accomplishments seemed small at first compared to their centuries of struggle against men, orcs, and even their own brethren, but we realized that we have rebuilt Eordand despite our short lives and polluted homeland.\n\nSome Elves look at us in envy and even hatred, such as the Star Elves of Aelnar. From the isle of Venáil as far west as they could sail, they dreamed of their homeland for generations, and at long last rediscovered Aelantir. But what they found was their home twisted from the heaven they dreamed of, and the Ruinborn mockeries to what they imagined were left behind of the Elven people. Driving themselves mad with this revelation, Aelnar has foresook their Moon Elven brethren and looks to us as savages who squat on their birthright.\n\nArriving late, the representative of Dawn proudly announced their presence to the council, attracting various degrees of distrust and disgust. Hailing from Rezankand in South Aelantir, the Dawn Elves have looted and ransacked the Ruinborn realms of Taychend, Effelai, and beyond. Championing the Bulwari Sun Cult, they have no tolerance for unbelievers. The Dawn Elf gloats and prides themselves on their accomplishments, but offers little of help.\n\nFinally, a letter is delivered at the port by the Sea Elves, explaining their interest in recent developments but that they have no intention of living on Aelantir oncemore. For them, their Arks are forever their home, only landing to resupply. For them, Aelantir is gone, for they have no desire to dwell on its tainted soil.\n\nMoon, Sun, and Wood all come from different worlds, and often may disagree and clash. But they see Eordand restoring control of Aelantir to the Ruinborn, and ask us if there may be room for their wayward cousins."
 eordand.21.a:0 "They are our siblings of Venaan. Aelantir shall be their home as well as ours."
 eordand.21.b:0 "The Elves have broken Aldan's order and have fled Aelantir. They have no place here."
 eordand.22.t:0 "Twilight of the Merchant Lords"
 eordand.22.d:0 "For centuries the so-called 'Merchant Lords' have plied the waves around Eordand, glorified pirates who have disrupted our trade and rule. But now that Eordand is united, they can no longer prey on us. Their fleets are an insignifant threat to us now that all under Summer's light may be utilized to sail the seas. But should they be removed? Our elders remember when the Merchant Lords were hired to turn the tide of battle, celebrated as heroes. Their skills as navigators and with unscrupulous matters, such as smuggling, have inspired countless victories and tales.\n\nThe decision is yours: will we offer the Merchant Lords service within our navy, or will we squash their troublesome thievery once and for all?"
 eordand.22.a:0 "The skills they know well, legitimate or not, will make them fine captains for our navy."
 eordand.22.b:0 "They can no longer harry us: let us be gone of their piracy!"

 eordand.23.d:0 "While the grand city of Svemel is under Eordan control, there is still an influential figure who holds sway over the Rzentur: Varlengeilt, the Dragon Prince. A young green dragon born of the previous Dragon-God Drozmagog, Varlengeilt holds great sway over the hearts of the Drozma Tur faithful, and should he wish could agitate them further against us. However, for now he remains silent within his lair, a heavily guarded palace in Svemel, watching the city from its pinnacle.\n\nShould the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wish, the palace and halls of worship may be looted for whatever may be found. But Varlengeilt's hoard is small, for after the death of Drozmagog it was split between the feuding Rzentur who each wished to raise the infant dragon. It would be wise to consider offering a donation instead, as the Rzentur do, to demonstrate your goodwill. Gifts of all kinds, from lowly vegetables to priceless gems to even willingly-offered brides are given to Varlengeilt, to be used to his discretion. Should it be known that Eordand recognizes Varlengeilt's spiritual authority, perhaps all of Rzenta will soon forget of our conquest?"
 eordand.23.a:0 "His hoard, however meagre, is ours to claim!"
 eordand.23.b:0 "Let us make a gift to Varlengeilt to appease his adherents."

But from above the Sarda have ever watched the Ynn flow over the cliff walls at Venaan's Tears, wondering where their beloved dead flowed.\n\nAll three claim ownership of the Trollsbay, but it is clear that only one can be satisfied. Will we confiscate the stolen lands from the colonists, returning them to the Boek who may walk their forest paths once more? Or will the Sarda be given ownership from Venaan's Tears to the Ynnsmouth, protecting the riverborne voyage of their dead to their afterlife?"
 eordand.26.a:0 "The Sarda have long watched Venaan's Tears from atop the Ruined Cliffs. It is natural that they inherit the lands below."
 eordand.26.b:0 "The Boek dwelt in these woods for far longer than they have struggled against the colonizers. It is only natural that they shall keep their land."
 eordand.26.c:0 "Although they come from across the sea to the east, these colonizers are no less entrenched in these lands than the Boek. They may stay, if they are loyal to us."
 eordand.27.t:0 "Deep Beneath the Armonadh"
 eordand.27.d:0 "Investigations into the subsurface of the Armonadh mountains have found vast quantities of iron ore, as well as lesser amounts of copper, gold, precious gems and other minerals. Utilizing innovative rituals that detect quantities of iron, the druids have crafted a report of where excavations should begin. But the iron ore veins do not often coincide with other mineral deposits, leading some to suggest that the need for iron is not as great as acquiring a wealth of precious materials.\n\nRegardless of the focus, the expeditions into the Armonadh should be an incredible boon to our economy. A new and plentiful source of iron will end our eternal dependence on copper and bronze. But this is not without cost: establishing infrastructure, hiring miners and professionals, disposing of rock waste, and even the usage of mages to protect the safety of the mine will all add up to an exorbitant cost. Is it worth it?"
 eordand.27.a:0 "The formations rich in Iron are our primary concern!"
 eordand.27.b:0 "Riches other than iron should be focused on."
 eordand.27.c:0 "Perhaps it is not worth it searching for a few useful rocks?"
 eordand.28.t:0 "Transformation of the Gardens of Grebniesth"
 eordand.28.d:0 "Far from their homeland, the Gardens of Grebniesth are a stark contrast to the cold northern woods of the Ynnic Valley and beyond. Like a long-lost twin of Darhan, the Grebniesther have grown an elaborate and bountiful collection of Aelantiran botany. It is with no doubt that their land is blessed with Spring, the season of regrowth! Every few years new seedlings are planted, showing new displays of dazzling flowers and fruits. With channeling the power of Spring, what shall we promote at the Gardens of Grebniesth this cycle?"
 eordand.28.a:0 "Tulips: the sheer variety of shape and hue!"

 eordand.28.l:0 "Requiring little water, Succulents are beloved houseplants."
 eordand.29.t:0 "Treasures of the Sunken City"
 eordand.29.d:0 "Behind the northernmost dam of the Ynn lies Mocvare, the once-great city of Vareped that slowly sinks into marsh before the dam. Desperate to contain the flooding of the river, the Ynnic built great dams, but did not always perform the correct amount of research into their worksites. The dam at Mocbarja, east of Mocvare, began collecting vast amounts of water behind the newly constructed dam, and now laps at the edges of the city. Many priceless artifacts and tremendous works of architecture were lost to the rising lake, and the rest of the city has not been spared from flooding and subsidence. \n\nDolindhan divers have attempted to retrieve lost treasures from beneath the lake, but to little avail. However, with our expertise in the arts of Summer druidcraft, we can breathe underwater and possibly reclaim what was lost. But Mocvare has persevered and prospered using the waters, being a great trade hub along the Ynn. Like our ports on the Sarmadfar, Mocvare has the potential to control the trade along the northern Ynn."
 eordand.29.a:0 "What is drowned may rest there: let us focus on the riches that float on the Ynn instead."
 eordand.29.b:0 "Ignore the naysayers, there is wealth to be found in Mocvare!"
 eordand.29.c:0 "The Ynn is not our concern: our navy is in dire need of reform!"
 eordand.29.dd:0 "Reforms can wait: our enemy steals our birthright from before us!"
 eordand.30.t:0 "Dracball, Sword of Legend"
 eordand.30.d:0 "A sight to behold - Dracball, Slayer of Drozmagog, Sword of Legends - before me, all mine! It calls to me, a tangible sensation of eagerness and anticipation to wield it in one's hand. The metal of the deep-red blade, fashioned from a secret alloy by the Monkriok bladesmiths, is indistinguishable from bloodstains of its previous victims. With a clap of thunder, Dracball becomes encased with bolts of lightning. Heroes have wielded it, legends that are sung today - I can be one as well!"
 eordand.30.a:0 "Dracball is mine alone to wield! All shall fall before me!"
 eordand.30.b:0 "The temptation worries me... let Dracball rest."
 eordand.30.c:0 "A worthy champion must be found to wield Dracball!"
 eordand.31.t:0 "Sharing Winter's Clemency"
 eordand.31.d:0 "Having long dwelt in northern Eordand, the Snecboth of the Winter Court are used to hardship. But in the forests and bleak iceberg-studded seas to the east, we have been reminded that other peoples are not so fortunate as us to channel the power of Winter. While it is a time of scarcity, it is important that the community is insured food and warmth. Let us extend our generosity to our greater realm, to the unfortunate Rzentur and others who shiver and freeze.\n\nA classic, the Midwinter Solstice invites the Snecboth to a great celebration in the midst of winter when the nights become long. Or Collath, the celebrated game of strategy and patience, could be hosted and taught to our subjects. But perhaps this year the celebrations should remain silent and watchmen observant, for the enemies of Winter threaten us and will meet their end in a cold embrace."
 eordand.31.a:0 "At Midwinter Solstice we shall reconnect with friends old and yet to be."
 eordand.31.b:0 "Organize the Collath tournament!"
 eordand.31.c:0 "Many who are not attuned to Winter suffer in the cold months: we must aid them."
 eordand.31.dd:0 "In Winter the snow piles and water freezes. Should they come to us, Winter shall greet our enemy."
 eordand.32.t:0 "The Antlered King"
 eordand.32.d:0 "On the outskirts of the Drevonsred forest, the great tree Amatrvo beckons once more. Akin to the fey of the Domandrod, the Amatrvo seems to speak to those who recite to it poems spoken from the heart. Naturally, the Peitar are experts of poetry due to our Eordellon heritage, allowing us to listen to its words. Amatrvo's hollows are large enough for an entire palace, which is what it served for the Drevkenuco before us. From the heart of the tree a throne has been carved, where one worthy may sit and be one with the tree, feeling with its roots and branches across the Ynn.\n\nWhile seated on the throne, one commands immense power and respect. When the Antlered King commands, so named after the majestic antlered horses of the Drevonsred forest, all listen and obey. For all know that there is no betraying the primeval forest."
 eordand.32.a:0 "The Antlered King shall listen to all in a grand audience."
 eordand.32.b:0 "It is time our subjects are reminded of their oaths of loyalty!"
 eordand.32.c:0 "Majestic beasts crowned with antlers, my how they charge and trample!"
 eordand.33.t:0 "The Dalairey Expedition: Help Wanted"
 eordand.33.d:0 "Searching the Dalairey Wastes is no task for the faint hearted: blistering cold, wild and tainted magical storms, acidic lakes, and worse are known to be the fates of those who have tried before. Despite these dangers, two groups have volunteered: a veteran company of Eordan Expeditionaries, and a group of plucky foreign adventurers.\n\nThe Eordan Expeditionaries claim they are suited for this task, having explored the shadowy corners of Aelantir for Precursor Relics, facing all manner of danger and emerging victorious. They accomplish this through their professionalism and arcane knowledge, each member of the expedition proficient with survival skills and able to recite solutions to innumerable situations. Meanwhile, the adventurers sell their services for gold. They make boasts of adventures, many misadventures for sure, and claim that where they're going will need their intuition and impeccable good luck."
 eordand.33.a:0 "The Expeditionaries have abundant experience with exploring Precursor ruins."
 eordand.33.b:0 "Some gold will pay for the loyalty of these adventurers."
 eordand.33.c:0 "The Dalairey Wastes have been abandoned for good reason. Let us leave them alone."
 eordand.34.t:0 "The Dalairey Expedition: A Disappointing Discovery"
 eordand.34.d:0 "An almost empty chamber. After all this time, some barely salvageable artifacts and a load of ice? Eordand cannot afford to be financing such a dissapointment: give me some reason to continue this expedition!"
 eordand.34.a:0 "This cannot be all there is. Dig beneath the ice and rubble until you find more!"
 eordand.34.b:0 "This site may be a dissapointment, but there may be else to discover further in the wastes."
 eordand.34.c:0 "Unacceptable. This is all you have found? Return home immediately!"
 eordand.35.t:0 "The Dalairey Expedition: Under the Ice"
 eordand.35.d:0 "After months of excavation, a tunnel has been opened up into further ruins below. The ruins above appear to be part of an old tower, the pinnacle of some Precursor site long lost beneath the Dalairey ice sheets. Ancient flagstones wonderfully crafted of unknown material poke through the ice, forming a wall to some structure beyond. Could it be the Dalaire of old, Ducaniel's cursed city? What is for certain is that the way forward is unclear. An open but warded gate has been found, sealed against intruders with magical spells that our mages fear to tamper with. The passage ahead quickly dims, but it is clear that the long-abandoned ruin was once something great, with tarnished riches lying wrecked amongst ancient debris.\n\nAnticipation and fear is tangible in the air: beyond this gate may lie the fruits of our labor, that has cost countless lives to reach. The dissapointment of the previous ruin caused great distress amongst the expedition, causing tension to spark and doubts to fester. But now our goal is certain: artifacts and riches and power lie ahead, beyond our very gaze!\n\nScratching, screeching, dripping, creaking... the noises do not stop! The diggers grow impatient, some claiming that they can hear something beyond the walls, insisting that they can dig straight through the wall! Why go through the warded gate when we can dig through the masonry? We would get there sooner too - no more nights in this shivering cold wasteland, no more nightmares!"
 eordand.35.a:0 "We must trust in our mages to undo the magical wards."
 eordand.35.b:0 "The wards may lash out if not dispelled properly, let us excavate a tunnel instead."
 eordand.36.t:0 "The Dalairey Expedition: Facing a Cold Death"
 eordand.36.d:0 "White snow, in front of me, behind, around, above, below, everywhere - forever! When will it end! \n\nThe expedition soon found itself beset by a terrible ceaseless blizzard, lost deep within the Dalairey Wastes. Curse whoever thought we should head further in! Huddling beside fires, the expeditionaries spit bitter curses at each other, blaming each other for their fate. The only thing certain: an impossible decision must be made if the expedition is to survive another day."
 eordand.36.a:0 "Proceeding forth into the blizzard is a dangerous mistake. We must wait, or we will die."
 eordand.36.b:0 "Waiting here will surely be our doom! The blizzard may yet never end!"
 eordand.36.c:0 "Our Wintry druids claim they can manipulate the blizzard."
 eordand.37.t:0 "The Dalairey Expedition: A Disquieting Return"
 eordand.37.1:0 "At long last, word has returned from the Dalairey Expedition... all dead, save one who returned fully mad and clutching a brazen sculpture. Speaking gibberish and in constant fear, the survivor will not recall what happened to the expedition, save that none should look for them.\n\nThe Precursor ruin discovered in the ice is long gone, save for a few scraps of debris and frozen droplets of blood. The statue, depicting a proud elf of old, is covered in scratches and pits and is eternally cold to the touch. Looking upon it, you think of the lives lost to find - this! You find yourself staring at it in melancholy for hours, before realizing that no time has elapsed at all - you are still in your office, learning of the cursed expedition and looking upon the statue for the first time!"
 eordand.37.2:0 "At long last, word has returned from the Dalairey Expedition... all dead, save one who returned fully mad and clutching a chest full of Precursor riches. Bedraggled, wounded, and melancholic, the survivor claims that they buried the rest of it out in the wastes to keep it safe... alas, they have passed from this world. As for the rest of the treasure, it was not found, but what was found was a massacre in the wastes. Brothers turned on each other, possibly slaying each other for a chance at the treasure. What could have driven them to do such an action - surely they could have all arrived back home and lived comfortably forevermore?"
 eordand.37.a:0 "Let us at least study and understand it so their sacrifice was not in vain."
 eordand.37.b:0 "We must ensure that it is put to good use, so their sacrifice was not in vain."
 eordand.38.t:0 "The Dalairey Expedition: Tragedy..."
 eordand.38.d:0 "Silence, for months no word has arrived from the expedition. Fearing the worst, a search party has been sent for them, finding undescribable tragedy. Scattered bones, gnawed and teared and worse litter the entrance to the Precursor ruin beneath the ice. Bloodied knives and hacked bones... nonsensical writings on the walls. The passage beneath to the deeper ruins was caved in by the strike of a pick, a skeletal hand still clutching at its hilt. Let us never return to this cursed place."
 eordand.38.a:0 "All dead? By the seasons, we should have never gone to Dalaire!"
 eordand.39.t:0 "Across the Portal, a Familiar Forest"
 eordand.39.d:0 "Worlds apart, yet so close - the Domandrod and the Deepwoods are so alike. Walking through the Feyrealm, one can reach the other at ease. From the Deepwoods the Wood Elves have been stewards of the forest, yet they do not follow the Fey Lords. They preserve the harmony of nature, yet know no allegiance to season or balance of season. \n\nAcross the world, the Deepwoods are threatened by invaders and ruin at every turn. The trees cut and burned, squatted by Green men known as Orcs and Goblins, the Wood Elves need assistance to protect nature, imploring we aid them. But did the Fey Lords not promise us stewardship of the Domandrod and the fey-touched lands beyond? The Wood Elves know no greater allegiance. In Aelantir and the lands beyond, we will protect what is ours!"
 eordand.39.a:0 "The Fey Lords promised us the Domandrod, and with their grace the Deepwoods are ours!"
 eordand.39.b:0 "Let us work with the Wood Elves to protect our forests from the outside world."
 eordand.40.t:0 "Domandrod over Deepwoods"
 eordand.40.d:0 "At last, the borders of the Deepwoods rest easy, for the enemies of the forest have been driven off. The Wood Elves once more dwell in each glade, ever-grateful for our assistance - for without us, this would never have happened. The alliance between Eordand and the Wood Elves remains strong, but it is clear that the faithful fo the Fey Lords hold a stronger position. The Evergreen Pact holds true for now, but we can shape the future of the Deepwoods to something greater!"
 eordand.40.a:0 "It is time to unify the Deepwoods under Cyranvar, for they cannot protect it themselves."
 eordand.40.b:0 "Despite their flaws, the clan hierarchy should be maintained to ensure loyalty and security."
 eordand.40.c:0 "The Evergreen Pact has been fulfilled, but it need not end. Let this only be the beginning of the cooperation between the Deepwoods and Domandrod!"
 eordand.40.dd:0 "It is clear to us - The Wood Elves depend on us, they cannot stand on their own. They must answer to us, not just listen."
 eordand.41.t:0 "Frozenglass of Egstrel"
 eordand.41.d:0 "The isle of Egstrel has always been a desolate place, as far north as one can go in Eordand. Few have dwelt here, and those who do live a quiet life of fishing the frigid waters. But recently, these fishermen have discovered something quite curious: a smooth and clear substance upon the beaches after a storm. Melted by the intense heat of lightning, sheets of curious one-sided glass are produced from the sand of the beaches, quickly decorating houses in Marathmas. From the inside of one's home, one can view outside, while the Frozenglass prohibits outsiders from viewing inside. The sleepy island of Egstrel has become known across Eordand for Frozenglass, a true gem of the north."
 eordand.41.a:0 "I want my studio to be outfitted with Frozenglass - immediately!"
 eordand.44.t:0 "Treasures from the Hoard"
 eordand.44.d:0 "A great success! Slowly dragging their loot from Svemel, the burglar assigned to steal from Varlengeilt's hoard has returned with riches aplenty. No doubt the thief retained the best for themselves, but you cannot discount the great chest of gold and jewels!"
 eordand.44.a:0 "Thank the Fey Lords for their boon of shadow!"
 eordand.45.t:0 "Burnt Remains"
 eordand.45.d:0 "On prominent display outside of Varlengeilt's lair, a burnt body atop a pile of attempted plunder is shown for obvious meaning. It appears our burglar was caught in the act. It is probably for the best not to draw further ire."
 eordand.45.a:0 "At least we are anonymous?"
 eordand.47.t:0 "Draconic Scion"
 eordand.47.d:0 "It appears that the great dragon has valued our gifted bride. Swaddled in fine cloth, a babe with a curious few green scales has been delivered by a Rzentur servant of Varlengeilt. It is clear that the child is quite intelligent, already displaying aptitude for understanding language, and the dradh say that their magical powers are unmatched!"
 eordand.47.a:0 "Barrsac seems a fitting name."
 eordand.48.t:0 "Rejection"
 eordand.48.d:0 "It seems we have insulted the mighty dragon. Our bride that we had sent to it has returned teary-eyed and with a singed blouse. Moreover, Varlengeilt has requested that we do not bother him with courtship proposals in the future."
 eordand.48.a:0 "It seems that the bachelor dragon is not interested in Eordan..."
 eordand.55.t:0 "Ancient Treasury of Cadcimn"
 eordand.55.d:0 "Our explorers have uncovered an incredible find: a seemingly endless treasury of ancient Precursor treasures! Cavernous and full of half-buried chambers, this section of Cadcimn appears to have been a treasure vault of a Precursor lord of old. Not just filled with gold and jewels, but also half-working artifacts of wondrous origin. With time and patience, these valuables can be an incredible boon for our researchers! The only question that remains is: where do we start?"
 eordand.55.a:0 "I could almost swim in it!"
 eordand.56.t:0 "Archives of Cadcimn"
 eordand.56.d:0 "Behind piles of rubble and ancient locked doors, a seemingly humble hallway reveals itself to be the artery of a vast archive of knowledge. Magical enchantments upon walls inscribed with ancient runes reveal text from our ancestors. If there were any books or tomes, they have long since rotted. However, while this repository is exciting, many of the enchanted logs are incomprehensible with age, their enchantments fading."
 eordand.56.a:0 "Our researchers will enjoy this!"
 eordand.57.t:0 "Armory of Cadcimn"
 eordand.57.d:0 "The pride of an ancient warrior: a roughly oval-shaped cavernous chamber with tiered floors houses rows and rows of Precursor weapons and armor. Maces and spears still spark with magic at the touch, while protective wards have burned those tempted beyond caution. While most of the enchanted armory has faded with age, there are still some that are mighty weapons."
 eordand.57.a:0 "We shall be the pride of Eordand!"
 eordand.58.t:0 "What is the Shade of Victory?"
 eordand.58.d:0 "With the unification of Eordand under one state, it has been a topic of much discussion on the color scheme of our new banners. Some claim that a new state needs a new unifying symbol - something in gold, the most luxurious and lordly of all. The old guard are affronted with this, claiming that it is abandoning the traditions of the hard-won victors. They leave the answer to you alone."
 eordand.58.a:0 "Gold - wealth, the setting sun, and pride itself."
 eordand.58.b:0 "We shall take pride in our ancestral hues!"

 eordand_disaster.1.d:0 "At last, the druids and mages have sent word that their investigation into the magical anomaly within the Domancadh ruin has borne fruit: it appears that the unstable veil is a dormant portal, waiting to be opened. To where it leads is unknown, but the druids insist that the magic is stable and permanent, without risk of closing. From a safe distance you watch as the druids form a circle around the portal, beckoning and uttering arcane incantations, causing it to tear apart, leaving a jagged opening. Within moments a surface appears between the portal’s edges, wavy like a lakes surface at first but soon flattening out. An image of somewhere else soon appears, vibrant purples and oranges against sodden black stone… mesmerized by the vision, you hardly notice that two figures step out of the portal, one short and wearing a skull of an avian creature and the other tall and strong. \n\nStooped over and still looking at a scrap of moss-like paper, the avian skulled creature asks: "We seriously back in the Deepwoods again? I told’ya all that wandering around would lead us right back in a circle, didn’t I?" \n\n"Nah this doesn’t look too familiar, these ain’t the same woods," the large tusked figure slowly utters after peering around, not noticing you and the druids. "Least there ain’t any of them pointy-eared leaf eaters ‘round here."\n\nThe feathered skull looks up from the map, revealing beady red eyes. "This might be the first time you were ever useful, Mûg, if you weren’t saying the complete obvious facts. Come on now, make it up to me and get us some firew… hol’ on," he points with a sharp, yellow nail towards a low wall. "Looks like someone’s stacked here some stones."\n\n"Right, they don’t stack themselves," shouldering his jagged axe, the big one ambles towards the wall, "lemme take a look…" \n\nThe massive figure looks at the ancient bricks, pulls one out of the ancient mortar, and throws it in the distance. An audible thud and a gasp causes the large figure's eyes to open up and look for his little companion. "Somethink not right Zyt, hear that? Sounded like them pointy ears when they break a nail." \n\n"Well I never! I don’t care if this ain’t the Deepwoods, them elves are still here!

Will Summer be honored by returning the dead to the depths of the sea? Will Autumn's role of death in the circle of life be honored with the rot of the body? Or will Winter take precedence, with the body frozen in ice, honoring the stillness and stability of the deep winter?\n\nThere is another option, that of a funeral done in the style of the Precursor ancestors.
