 R38_break_bim_lau_title:0 "Break Bim Lau" 
 R38_break_bim_lau_desc:0 "While our conquest of our hated rival Bim Lau had to be put on hold by the Great Cyclone, it is high time to finish what we started. Now that we have reformed our standing army, all that remains is to give them some much-needed experience by cutting off this loose end." 

 R38_eliminate_title:0 "Eliminate the Competition" 
 R38_eliminate_desc:0 "The mercenary kingdom of Lot Dekkhang has begrudgingly earned our respect for administration and ensuring loyalty of large groups of diverse and often-feuding peoples within its army. If we could convince some of the surviving Daulophs of these mercenary armies of the benefits of a mutual agreement of cooperation, sweetened by some patronage and inclusion in stately matters, then our Adasa armies could experience a newly-invigorated flow of troops with a much-needed increase of effectiveness." 

 R38_soldiers_hire_title:0 "Soldiers for Hire" 
 R38_soldiers_hire_desc:0 "With the destruction of the Mercenary kingdom, nothing now stands in our way of monopolizing the mercenary and personal protection business in the south of Haless. We must use this, and leverage the reputation of our soldiers as perfectly loyal disciplined hirelings to expand our hegenomy and influence far beyond our borders" 

 R38_fleet_of_teak_title:0 "Fleet of Teak" 
 R38_fleet_of_teak_desc:0 "Teak is a wood endemic to the Rahen Coast. Its wood is durable, resistant to rot, and it shrinks relatively little from exposure to unpredictable environmental factors, making it well-suited for the purpose of boat-building and carpentry alike. Let us ensure our boatwrights and builders are well-supplied by state-subsidized logging camps, so that Bhuvauri will have the means to repair its battered infrastructure as well as reliably fuel its naval influence across the Gulf." 
 
 R38_capture_cape_title:0 "Capturing the Cape" 
 R38_capture_cape_desc:0 "Our neighbors in Iyarhashar have remained a thorn in our side for as long as our histories were intertwined. By eliminating them once and for all we will finally achieve dominance over the Raheni slave trade, not to mention the ability to use Sardika as a suitable springboard to facilitate our future expansions along the coast." 
 
 R38_last_free_title:0 "Last of the Free" 
 R38_last_free_desc:0 "The Boyebariti have been a constant source of squabbling as a result of their refusal to fall in line with the rest of the native Ofehebi kingdoms under the Raghimideshi, and their proclivity for taking every possible chance to disrupt our slave trade has forced our hand. We must make an example of them, to show exactly how dangerous it can be to get between our nation and our potential Adasa recruits." 
 
 R38_trade_twilight_title:0 "Trade and Twilight" 
 R38_trade_twilight_desc:0 "Countless solutions have been presented in regards to the question of piracy in the Gulf of Rahen, especially now that it has come increasingly apparent with the growth of our trading territory that so, too, will the profit losses incurred by unchecked buccaneering ventures.\n\nAfter much deliberation, it was decided to destroy the akalate of Dasmatuš entirely in order to send a message to any upstart pirate-lords who would wish to piggyback off our success. The Pirate Republic of Pinghoi, while more difficult to pacify, must have their holdings in Lupulan taken from them, that they will be unable to conduct further raids upon our coasts and merchant fleets.\n\nThe Naléni, however, present an altogether different opportunity. A not-insignificant number of their merchants and buccaneers have seen firsthand the great riches provided by our commercial enterprise and desire a cut of the action. In return for inclusion in our ventures, the harpies will act as auctioneers in our markets as well as overseers in the transportation of our merchandise." 
 
 R38_fetters_sarhal_title:0 "Fetters of Sarhal" 
 R38_fetters_sarhal_desc:0 "If there is anything we have learned from the Great Cyclone and our conquest of our surrounding lands, it is that fortune is fickle and fleeting. It is imperative, then, to ensure that the foundations of our merchant empire aren’t built atop pillars of sand, but on immovable stone. By fortifying and garrisoning our trading hubs, we will show our determination to stand any test that the fates would deign to throw at us, with our venerable and indomitable city of Ishudhen serving as its crown jewel."

 R38_mouth_cotton_title:0 "Mouth of the Cotton River" 
 R38_mouth_cotton_desc:0 "Placeholder" 
 
 R38_relock_the_gate_title:0 "Relock the Gate" 
 R38_relock_the_gate_desc:0 "Whilst the worst of the storm has come to pass, there still remains the fact that we remain a shadow of what we were prior to its arrival. Our command of the surrounding region remains weakened. We must conscript a new army, that we may be up to the task of finishing what we started with Bim Lau, as well as shoring up our defenses to ensure that we will be able to withstand any onslaughts blowing our way." 
 
 R38_hunting_the_headhunters_title:0 "Hunting the Headhunters" 
 R38_hunting_the_headhunters_desc:0 "Our quest for the control and stabilization of our immediate surroundings has made us acutely aware of the spirit-worshippers of Riskebo, with their penchant for allying with our rivals and slaughtering our traders, not to mention their dreadful habits of decapitating our dead for ritualistic purposes. More importantly, they also possess some of the most lush forests filled with quality wood in the region, which would benefit our fleet to no end.\n\nBy breaking their armies with our Adasa and breaking their foolish preconceptions of spirits with our High Philosophy, we will ensure access to the timber necessary to fuel our ever-expanding commercial navy." 
 
 R38_prosecute_the_pirate_title:0 "Prosecute the Pirates" 
 R38_prosecute_the_pirate_desc:0 "Now that we have negated the damage to our navy after dealing with the turmoil resulting from the Great Cyclone, it is crucial that we use it to rid ourselves of the meddlesome pirates in the Gulf of Rahen and the Ringlet Sea, who see our commercial ships floating sources of gold and new recruits into their crews.\n\nWe will send a message for all to see what happens to those who would are to come between Bhuvauri and our merchandise!" 
 
 R38_the_gulf_wars_title:0 "The Gulf Wars" 
 R38_the_gulf_wars_desc:0 "While it would previously behoove us to use Raghamideshi middle men to facilitate our commercial enterprises, the time has come where its efficiency is in clear doubt in comparison to if it were under our direct control. If we are to grow our ever-expanding market influence, we have no choice but to cut these middle-men out entirely, allowing us to deal with our suppliers directly with increased ease of access." 
 
 R38_shackle_maker_mountains_title:0 "Shackle-Maker Mountains" 
 R38_shackle_maker_mountains_desc:0 "The rapid expansion of our trade empire has led to the arisal of previously-unforeseen predicaments, one of the most immediately-pressing of which being that our shackles-producers are unable to cope with the ever-increasing demands of our slavers. The great mountains of Telekenid, rich in iron, could potentially solve this discrepancy between supply and demand, while also bolstering our supply of raw materials to fuel our expanding military." 
 
 R38_suhans_speech_title:0 "Suhan's Speech" 
 R38_suhans_speech_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Suhan’s speech in Sramaya, there has been an ever-stifling tension in the air.\n\nWhilst Suhan's exaltation of our system has been a great source of prestige for us, it has produced a great quandary. Increasing numbers of riots have sprung up, perpetrated largely by members of lower castes roused to demands of increased social mobility and resulting in many already-established members of the upper castes concerned that their current positions in the hierarchy are in jeopardy.\n\nRegardless to whether these worries are warranted or not, the time has come to make a choice; will we embrace the traditional rigidity of the caste structure as enforced by High Philosophy teachings, or will we follow Suhan’s vision of social mobility?" 
 
 R38_sugar_spice_title:0 "Sugar and Spice" 
 R38_sugar_spice_desc:0 "The merchants of the middle castes have repeatedly reminded the upper castes of the folly brought about by focusing on the sole export of chattel whilst simultaneously attempting to subtly shift our gaze to the fertile lands along the Kharunyana Delta. Although it pains us to admit, the lands could indeed make suitable spice and sugar plantations with a bit of time and effort, and it would be best to set up this venture sooner rather than later. We are, after all, in no short supply of laborers." 
 
 R38_brass_bombards_title:0 "Brass Bombards" 
 R38_brass_bombards_desc:0 "The influx of ideas and technologies introduced to us as a result of our continued partnership with the Baashidi has proven to be greatly beneficial to us. Alongside the trade of merchandise, so too has their distinct brand of curiosity been introduced to our keen administrators, recently focused upon the usage of artillery. While we had previously thought of cannons as little more than a means of battering and breaking fortified positions, the Baashidi's natural inquisitiveness has -- I can’t do this one Edward, there is so little Baashidi lore that I don’t know how to do it yet" 
 
 R38_business_as_usual_title:0 "Business as Usual" 
 R38_business_as_usual_desc:0 "Now that we have largely repaired the damage wrought by the Grat Ishudhen Cyclone as well as regained our control over our trading territory, it is time to show Rahen that that Sramaya is back in business. For now and forever, let it be known that nothing, not the great winds nor the inexorable spirits themselves, stop us Bhuvauri in our quest for dominance in all things commercial." 
 
 R38_befriend_the_baashidi_title:0 "Befriend the Baashidi" 
 R38_befriend_the_baashidi_desc:0 "It is a common misconception among our customers that slaves seem to grow on trees in Bhuvauri. This is obviously untrue, for while we do contribute somewhat to the overall production of slaves in all of Halann, we would prefer to sell slaves rather than create them.\n\nThe burden of supplying our ever-expansive markets with fresh chattel largely falls to the hands of the South-Sarhali peoples of the Bashidi, whose mark was made on the slave trade long before slaves from Bashidi markets ever had a chance to overthrow the Raj and proclaim the founding of our great nation. Even now our ties to the Bashidi remain strong, with our Adasa modeled after their own Adeen armies.\n\nIt would directly benefit us to seek mutual relations and cooperation with the suppliers of our lifeblood, and along with it, the sizable boons it would doubtlessly provide." 
 
 R38_adasa_academies_title:0 "Adasa Academies" 
 R38_adasa_academies_desc:0 "In its current state, our Adasa are the private armies of the various merchant families in the middle castes of Bhuvauri society who, whether in necessary circumstances or in exchange for some bargaining power among the upper castes, grant their usage to the government.\n\nThis system is untenable and inefficient, as it has led to discrepancies in training and outfitting, as well as facilitating a reliance that our enemies could reliably exploit. By creating a more robust and uniform system, with dedicated training academies located in Sramaya and Ishudhen as well as localized offshoot facilities for housing and further training, we can ensure that this possibility should never come to pass." 
 
 R38_old_soldiers_title:0 "Old Soldiers Administrate" 
 R38_old_soldiers_desc:0 "It would seem that, as a direct result of our recent conquests, we have encountered some difficulty in the administration of our new borderlands. While our current administrators are by no means wanting in skill, the growing phenomenon of klanti, or administrative fatigue, is raising questions of how to survive our own success.\n\nThe proposed remedy to this problem, the Jhuna Parakha, is a battery of exams administered to veteran Adasa. Upon reaching forty years of age, they will return to the academies, where it will be determined if they have the wisdom and experience required to bear the burden of bureaucracy. This will no doubt alleviate our need for skilled bureaucrats, as well as provide an incentive for Adasa to remain loyal to our cause." 
 
 R38_purchase_phangban_title:0 "Purchase of Phangban" 
 R38_purchase_phangban_desc:0 "For decades we have exerted our control over the (government) of Phangban both commercially and politically, carefully fostering a reliance upon Bhuvauri for everything from merchandise to raw materials. It is high time we formalized this relationship. We will give them an offer they cannot refuse in the form of an extravagant display of wealth, and in return they will act simultaneously as our march and as our own personal supplier of porcelain."

# Events
 flavor_bhuvauri.1.t:0 "The Great Ishudhen Typhoon"
 flavor_bhuvauri.1.desc:0 "When great white clouds were first spotted off the coasts of Ishuden, few paid them more than a passing glance. The war against Bim Lau was going well, the city of Bieng Phang had fallen, and trade was good. When it was clear that what had previously looked like telltale signs of a mild seasonal squall was in truth the herald of the most vicious storm to ever ravage the coast of Rahen, it was too late.\n\nLasting just over a week and striking across the Kharunyana delta with a brutality the never before seen, the Great Ishuden Cyclone mercilessly swept anyone and anything it grasped out to see. With hundreds of thousands going missing, and drowned bodies continuing to wash ashore from the shattered remains of the delta, we had no choice but to recall our forces and settle merely for Bieng Phang and a jungle swarming with recalcitrant heathens. The battered and broken silk and spice plantations now lay silent.\n\nThe storm has finally passed, but the recovery will be a long and hard process. We must persevere as our fathers did under the Raja’s yoke. For if we do not, we shall be swept away, not by a storm, but by the tides of history."
 flavor_bhuvauri.1.a:0 "We Remain!"
 flavor_bhuvauri.2.t:0 "The Great Ishudhen Typhoon"
 flavor_bhuvauri.2.desc:0 "In 1444, Ishuden and its surrounding area was devastated by great hurricanes and flooding unlike the seasonal monsoons of years prior, a disaster far greater  than any seen since the Day of Ashen Skies itself, though it mercifully passed by the rest of the Kharaunyana Coast with little distinction. Were it not for the horrific sight of debris and bodies washing ashore, we would have assumed that the storms were no different from its predecessors. Now that the worst has some to pass, it is time for the survivors to repair the damage and grant the dead a proper burial."
 flavor_bhuvauri.2.a:0 "This is going to hurt"
 flavor_bhuvauri.3.t:0 "The Three Families Rotate Power"
 flavor_bhuvauri.3.desc:0 "The previous Adasedata's term draws to a close, and the time has come to select a new leader for Bhuvauri's armies. This works by selecting a candidate from one of the three houses of Bhuvauri. There is the Dakinshi house of Sky-Eyes, spiritual and mysterious. The Bulwari house of Szel-Arcus, pragmatic and tolerant. And the Fangaulan house of Sanukelborlan, militaristic and belligerent. Power rotates between the three families; who shall come next?"
 flavor_bhuvauri.3.a:0 "They shall be from the house of Dakinshi"
 flavor_bhuvauri.3.b:0 "He shall be from the house of Bulwar"
 flavor_bhuvauri.3.c:0 "He shall be from the house of Fangaula"
 flavor_bhuvauri.6.t:0 "Blood Market of Prukakhin"
 flavor_bhuvauri.6.desc:0 "Despite the ongoing tension between the Bhuvauri foreign cultured elite, and the native populace, they are united in one thing; Their loathing of Piracy.\n\n As such, it is no mystery as to why the red haired evils Prukkahin are considered the most wicked of men. Not only to they raid and plunder, but it was they who drove the elephants of Bomdam extinct, a crime the house of Sky-Eyes found especially appalling due to believing the animal to be one of the most sacred.\n\nAs such, they have taken a great deal of righteous joy in showing the men of Prukkahin the error of their ways.Suffice to say, the floating city of Prukakhin was devastated, and the the sight of the former lord of Prukakhin being tossed between execution elephants both natural and shape-shifted brought tears of mirth and happiness to the cheeks of many of those present."
 flavor_bhuvauri.6.a:0 "Mercy is Earned, not given."
 flavor_bhuvauri.7.t:0 "West to the Sunset"
 flavor_bhuvauri.7.desc:0 "With the loss of the mainland, the people of Dasmatuš, isolated on their island, turned to piracy and raiding. They hoped to gain wealth, enough to retake their lost home or at least protect their last bastion of power. However, as they attacked our ships, stealing the cargo destined for the academies. They signed their own death warrant.\n\nTheir island burns, their homes are ransacked and looted, and their people are huddled in chains. And with the plunging of the last old sun below the waves, we will no longer have ships we send west be bothered by such parasites. At the end of the day, slaves are slaves, and the Academies will have its due."
 flavor_bhuvauri.7.a:0 "Trade slaves with the gnolls"
 flavor_bhuvauri.8.t:0 "Silence the Sirens?"
 flavor_bhuvauri.8.desc:0 "Yet another group of pirates, the fearsome harpies of the Naylani have long since raided the seas around their mountains, until now. With our subjugation of them, however, comes a rather unique conundrum. Usually we would just add their children to the Academies, but their ability to fly makes it difficult to enslave them. As such, we have come up with three possible solutions. We could drive them off, of course, but that would take resources and be distasteful for many of us. Or we could make a deal with them, that in exchange for letting them keep their mountains, we will have the coast to ensure no pirate will harm our ships."

 flavor_bhuvauri.9.desc:0 "With the rise of the Great Command and their totalitarian regime, many hobgoblins have been exiled or fled for various reasons, with the majority finding their way to the city of Lot Dekkhang, employed by the Daulophs in their mercenary armies. Despite this, they stand apart and are distrusted by their fellows. With the recent conquest and subjugation of the city of discipline, many hobgoblins have been orphaned due to the wars, and would make excellent candidates for the Academies."

 flavor_bhuvauri.16.desc:0 "At noon-time in the city centre of Sramaya, the beating heart of hearts, an aging harimari stood, red silk robes flowing in the wind, grey whiskers twitching in the humid air. He was flocked by followers, a raheni woman at his side, a hand on her blade. As a crowd gathered, either curious or wary, Suhan spoke. He gave a speech, similar to many others he had given in his long life of philosophy and debate within the halls of Rahen, woes against the stagnation of one’s place in life, despite their deed or character.\n\n"And yet," he said, a glimmer of hope in those old eyes of his, "In this city of slaves and slavers, I see promise. The Academies, the Three Families, through these even the lowest can rise high, enlightened and educated via their own merits. I dare say that this is the only place in Rahen where this is so."\n\nAs his speech ended, and silence drew over the crowd, there was a pause. And then the riots began, dissent emboldened by Suhan’s words, a spark had been lit within Sramaya that couldn’t be halted even as the streets were brought back under order at spearpoint. Something has changed in Bhuvauri, and there is only the question of if we embrace or reject it."

For some who they visited, the promised coin in exchange for their ‘support’ in these trying and turbulent times, for others… They would be removed from the equation, weeds being rooted out of this great garden we build to span the river. At dawn, these strings of pearls shall become one under the Brass Dragon."

 flavor_bhuvauri.19.t:0 "Response to Coup"
 flavor_bhuvauri.19.desc:0 "Our activities in the Porcelain Cities have not gone unnoticed. West amongst the lords of the Raj, and east with the Kai, word spreads of the Kharunaya, now dominated by one power: Bhuvauri. Needless to say, they are not pleased, and have already denounced us for this, multiple times even."
 flavor_bhuvauri.19.a:0 "Well what are they going to do about it?"
 flavor_bhuvauri.20.t:0 "Origins of the Adasa"
 flavor_bhuvauri.20.desc:0 "The Adasa Academies were born of desperation. When the rebellion had won, and Bhuvauri had been born, the Raj and Bom scorned the slaves, and threatened invasion and subjugation. With this great threat, our forefathers reestablished the slave trade to gain soldiers from Fangaula, Bulwar, and Bwa Dakinshi, so that they may defend what they had fought so hard to win. Within this system it was decreed that no native born of Rahen or Bomdan would be able to partake in the Academies and therefore get a chance to rise through the ranks of state.\n\nNow, with our independence and security more certain, and the growing numbers of Raheni and Bom within our state, calls for opening this system up to the masses have grown louder and louder.
