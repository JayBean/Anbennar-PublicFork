 R38_break_bim_lau_title:0 "Break Bim Lau"
 R38_break_bim_lau_desc:0 "While the conquest of our hated rival Bim Lau had to be put on hold due to the... unfortunate timing of the Great Cyclone, it is high time to finish what we started. Now that we have reformed our standing army, all that remains is to bleed them and tie up loose ends, as though one were applying a tourniquet."

 R38_eliminate_title:0 "Eliminate the Competition"
 R38_eliminate_desc:0 "The mercenary kingdom of Lot Dekkhang has long fascinated us. Our money doesn't speak as well as it ought, when it comes to the armies-for-hire of Rahen, yet here is a nation founded entirely by those groups. They have earned our begrudging respect—it is not easy to keep so many diverse interest groups employed in the army without them tearing the state apart. If we could convince some of the surviving Daulophs of these companies to cooperate with us (sweetened by some patronage and inclusion in stately matters), then our Adasa armies could experience a newly-invigorated flow of troops with a much-needed increase of effectiveness."

 R38_soldiers_hire_title:0 "Soldiers for Hire"
 R38_soldiers_hire_desc:0 "With the destruction of the Merchant Kingdoms of the Raghamidesh and the Mercenary State of Lot Dekkhang, nothing stands in our way of monopolizing the mercenary and personal protection business in Rahen. In particular, opportunities abound with regards to the Porcelain Guild, whose valuable trade goods are of great interest to us. If we could leverage the reputation of our soldiers as perfectly disciplined hirelings and throw our money around a little, our hegemony and influence could expand far beyond our borders."

 R38_fleet_of_teak_title:0 "Fleet of Teak"
 R38_fleet_of_teak_desc:0 "Teak is a wood endemic to the Rahen Coast. It is durable, resistant to rot, and it shrinks relatively little from exposure to unpredictable environmental factors, making it well-suited for the purpose of ships and buildings alike. Let us ensure our shipwrights and carpenters are well-supplied by state-subsidized logging camps, so that Bhuvauri will have the means to repair its battered infrastructure and reliably fuel its naval influence across the Gulf."
 
 R38_capture_cape_title:0 "Capturing the Cape"
 R38_capture_cape_desc:0 "Our neighbors in Iyarhashar are something much worse than our rivals—they are our competition. Buyers of Sarhali slaves, their involvement has continually driven up prices, not to mention their morally bankrupt participation in the act of slavery. By eliminating them once and for all, we will finally achieve dominance over the Raheni side of the slave trade, and gain the ability to use Sardika as a suitable springboard for our future expansions along the coast."
 
 R38_last_free_title:0 "Last of the Free"
 R38_last_free_desc:0 "Boyebareti, where to begin. They are a nuisance, for one. They refuse to fall in line with the rest of the native Ofehebi kingdoms under the Raghimideshi, and their proclivity for taking every possible chance to disrupt our slave trade has forced our hand. We must make an example of them, to show exactly how dangerous of a mistake they have made. The Adasa system demands more recruits."
 
 R38_trade_twilight_title:0 "Trade and Twilight"
 R38_trade_twilight_desc:0 "Piracy in the Gulf of Rahen has become increasingly rampant with the growth of trade, to the point where they are making a dent on our balance sheets. After much deliberation, it has been decided to destroy the Akalate of Dasmatuš as a warning, and have the Pirate Republic of Pinghoi stripped of their Lupulan ports, depriving them of their ability to conduct further raids upon our coasts and merchant fleets.\n\nThe Naléni, however, present an altogether different opportunity. A not-insignificant number of their merchants and buccaneers have seen firsthand the great riches provided by our commercial enterprise and desire a cut of the action. In return for inclusion in our ventures, the harpies will act as auctioneers in our markets as well as overseers in the transportation of our merchandise."
 
 R38_fetters_sarhal_title:0 "Fetters of Sarhal"
 R38_fetters_sarhal_desc:0 "If there is anything we have learned from the Great Cyclone and our conquest of our surrounding lands, it is that fortune is fickle and fleeting. It is imperative, then, to ensure that the foundations of our merchant empire aren’t built atop pillars of sand, but on immovable stone. From this day forward, we proclaim the inviobility of our empire, with our venerable and indomitable city of Ishudhen serving as its crown jewel: everywhere the trade in slaves shall increase tenfold, and the trading hubs shall be fortified and garrisoned. We shall withstand any test that the Oracle would deign to throw at us."
 
 R38_silken_tongues_title:0 "Silken Tongues"
 R38_silken_tongues_desc:0 "With the growth of wealth from commerce over the years, perhaps it's time to use this to ‘convince’ neighbours of our way of things. Those along the Dhenbasana, a sister river to our own great Kharunyana, would be a great place to begin. A few kind words here and there, and with a large supply of coins, we could come to an arrangement giving us immense military and economic influence over them."
 
 R38_mouth_cotton_title:0 "Mouth of the Cotton River"
 R38_mouth_cotton_desc:0 "With influence over the river, it's time to bring it fully under our brass wing. While the Raj is rotten to the core, a rotting tree can still crush its neighbours as it falls. As such, we would need fortifications and barracks to ward off their incursions. Instead of lush, open farmlands, they will face the stone walls and steel spears of our Adasa Guard."
 
 R38_relock_the_gate_title:0 "Relock the Gate"
 R38_relock_the_gate_desc:0 "The storm has passed, and we are left a shadow in its wake. If we do not act soon, our enemies will gnaw at our bones like the vultures they are. We need to secure the Gate and garrison both it and our capital, unless we want invasions from both sea and land to follow this calamity."
 
 R38_end_the_red_devils_title:0 "End the Red Devils"
 R38_end_the_red_devils_desc:0 "There is not a name more accursed than that of Prukakhin, the scourge of all who have known them. They are a mockery of man, making women and children into widows and orphans, and always delighting in the grim, sickening spectacle of their existence. It is high time someone shows them the error of their ways, every excruciating second of it."
 
 R38_prosecute_the_pirate_title:0 "Prosecute the Pirates"
 R38_prosecute_the_pirate_desc:0 "Now that we have blunted the damage to our navy resulting from the Great Cyclone and its aftermath, it is crucial that we use it to see to the meddlesome pirates in the Gulf of Rahen and the Ringlet Sea, who see our commercial ships as floating sources of gold and new recruits into their crews.\n\nWe will show them what happens when you mess with our business!"
 
 R38_the_gulf_wars_title:0 "The Gulf Wars"
 R38_the_gulf_wars_desc:0 "While it would previously behoove us to use Raghamideshi middle men to facilitate our commercial enterprises, our need for efficiency outweighs idle nostalgia. If we are to grow our ever-expanding market influence, we have no choice but to cut them out entirely, dealing with our suppliers directly with increased ease of access."
 
 R38_shackle_maker_mountains_title:0 "Shackle-Maker Mountains"
 R38_shackle_maker_mountains_desc:0 "The rapid expansion of our trade empire has set off an all consuming need for more recruits for the Adasa Academies, and that has run into a slight problem: we do not have enough iron to make the shackles we need. The great mountains of Telekenid could be our solution, however. If we were able to bolster their production and transport, we could fix this bottleneck, and ensure our Adasa are well fed."
 
 R38_suhans_speech_title:0 "Suhan's Speech"
 R38_suhans_speech_desc:0 "Suhan may have spoken with a whisper in his old age, but his words have rippled across the continent.\n\nWhilst his exaltation of our system has been a great source of prestige for us, it has raised questions. Increasing numbers of riots have broken out, perpetrated largely by members of lower castes with demands of increased social mobility, and resulting in many members of the upper castes concerned that their positions are in jeopardy.\n\nRegardless of whether these worries are warranted or not, the time has come to make a choice; will we stick with the rigid ways of the High Philosophy, or embrace Suhan’s Praxis as one of its greatest champions?"
 
 R38_sugar_spice_title:0 "Sugar and Spice"
 R38_sugar_spice_desc:0 "With our ties with the Baashidi increasing more and more every day, the middle castes are reminding us that our export does not solely have to be chattel, gesturing to the fertile plains of the Kharunyana, perfect for growing cash crops. While slaves are the most infamous good of the Baashidi, demand for sugar and spices are booming along their trade routes. If we were to be the supplier of this demand, we could line our pockets with our product being sold across Haless and Sarhal."
 
 R38_brass_bombards_title:0 "Brass Bombards"
 R38_brass_bombards_desc:0 "The influx of ideas and technologies introduced to us as a result of our continued partnership with the Baashidi has proven to be incredibly beneficial to us. Alongside the trade of merchandise, so too has their distinct brand of curiosity been introduced to our keen administrators, recently focused upon the usage of artillery. While we had previously thought of cannons as little more than a means of battering and breaking fortified positions, the Baashidi's love of arithmetic and geometry have enabled us to use our cannons in the field of combat, battering the enemy positions as well as bringing fortresses to heel."
 
 R38_business_as_usual_title:0 "Business as Usual"
 R38_business_as_usual_desc:0 "After long last, we have finally repaired most of the damage wrought by the Grat Ishudhen Cyclone. As well as regaining control over our trading territory, it is time to show Rahen that Sramaya is back in business. For now and forever, let it be known that nothing, not the great winds nor the inexorable spirits themselves, stop Bhuvauri in our domination over all things commerce and trade."
 
 R38_befriend_the_baashidi_title:0 "Befriend the Baashidi"
 R38_befriend_the_baashidi_desc:0 "It is a common misconception among our customers that slaves grow on trees in Bhuvauri. Obviously untrue, for while we do contribute to the overall production of slaves in all of Halann, we would prefer to buy and sell slaves rather than create our own.\n\nThe burden of supplying our ever-expansive markets with fresh ‘recruits’ largely falls to the hands of our industrious partners, the Baashidi, whose mark was made on the slave trade long before some of their slaves ever had a chance to overthrow the Raj and proclaim the founding of our great nation.\n\nEven now our ties to them remain strong, with our Adasa modeled after their own Adeen armies. It is high time we seek closer relations with them, for both more slaves and a boon to commerce."
  
 R38_integrate_the_bhoorakama_title:0 "Integrate the Bhoorakama" 
 R38_integrate_the_bhoorakama_desc:0 "Placeholder" 
 
 R38_adasa_academies_title:0 "Adasa Academies"
 R38_adasa_academies_desc:0 "Founded in the earliest days following our revolt, the Adasa are the private armies of various merchant families in Bhuvauri, who lend them to the government in exchange for either coin or political bargains from the upper castes. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this system is untenable and inefficient, as it both leads to vast discrepancies between Adasa, and a loyalty to the merchants rather than the state, sowing division that we cannot afford..\n\nBy centralizing the system within our own Academies in Sramaya and Ishuden, as well as providing uniform equipment and training, we can both bolster the quality and quantity of Adasa, as well as ensure their loyalty to Bhuvauri above all else. No more half measures; sons and daughters, raised by the State to serve the State and none other."
 
 R38_old_soldiers_title:0 "Old Soldiers Administrate"
 R38_old_soldiers_desc:0 "With our conquests ramping up considerably, we are beginning to run into problems with keeping what we have gained. Our current administrators are by no means wanting in skill, it is the growing phenomenon of klanti, administrative fatigue, that is the problem.\n\nThe proposed remedy to this, the Jhuna Parakha, is a battery of exams administered to veteran Adasa. Upon reaching forty, they will return to the academies, where it will be determined if they have the wisdom and experience required to bear the burden of bureaucracy. Not only will this provide a steady stream of administrators for our realm, but it will be a strong incentive for loyalty within the ranks of the Guard."
 
 R38_purchase_phangban_title:0 "Purchase of Phangban"
 R38_purchase_phangban_desc:0 "For decades we have exerted our control over the city of Phangban both commercially and politically, carefully fostering a reliance upon Bhuvauri for everything from merchandise to raw materials. It is high time we formalized this relationship. We will give them an offer they cannot refuse: wealth beyond measure, and in return they will act simultaneously as both an extension of our might and as our own personal supplier of porcelain."
 
 R38_smoke_water_title:0 "Smoke on the Water...."
 R38_smoke_water_desc:0 "Phangban is now under our control, and yet we are not done. The rest of the Porcelain Cities are to come under our control, though we must use more… underhanded methods. Nevertheless this plan must start via economic influence."
 
 R38_fire_sky_title:0 "...Fire in the Sky"
 R38_fire_sky_desc:0 "And now we push our claim, whether that be by coin or cannon. Our Adasa Guard must be bolstered with the addition of artillery, as well as our spies be within the walls of those who resist us. If they will not join us, we will make them."
 
 R38_all_vases_title:0 "All your Vases Belong to Us"
 R38_all_vases_desc:0 "We cannot simply stop once the cities of the Kharunyana are under our command, of course. We must show the world that we are not simply the latest custodians of the Porcelain Cities: We are the greatest, and they will never forget that when we are done here."
 
 R38_spreading_prosperity_title:0 "Spreading Prosperity"
 R38_spreading_prosperity_desc:0 "We are not conquerors. We do not seek thrones and idle riches seized from our subjects: We are uplifters, innovators who seek to bring the old and decayed lands we touch into the light of prosperity. We will build mills and farms and renovate the Golden Highway to connect them, and they will divide the history of Haless into two portions: Before and After Bhuvauri."
 
 R38_branching_mission_2a_title:0 "Branching Mission"
 R38_branching_mission_2a_desc:0 "This mission will be revealed later, and its contents will change depending on whether we are §YHigh Philosophy§! or §YSuhan's Praxis§!"

 R38_far_wide_title:0 "...Far and Wide"
 R38_far_wide_desc:0 "Across sea and land the Praxis must spead, from the walled cities of the Bom to the warm seas of the Coffee Coast, people will know the truth of enlightened liberation, and they will be happy. We shall too bring the knowledge of the printing press, so the words of the Great Suhan can be immortalized!"

 R38_four_men_elephant_title:0 "Four Men and an Elefante"
 R38_four_men_elephant_desc:0 "It has become evident that as it stands, we cannot quell the Praxis, you cannot kill these ideas of their’s, but that does not simply mean we must submit to them. We should instead gather our advisors and print, print pamphlets urging a… reconciliation between our two peoples, and bind together the Philosophy."
 
 R38_artificial_fabrics_title:0 "Artificial Fabrics"
 R38_artificial_fabrics_desc:0 "Silk and cotton has long been a staple of Rahen, with the land being known for its great array of colors and styles which dot both palaces and abodes. But even this venerable profession is not one we cannot uplift into its true potential. It will take a great deal of manpower, capital, and willpower, but nothing we cannot provide. They will refer to the production now as a trickle compared to the torrent of fabric we are to unleash."
 
 R38_eastern_anbenncost_title:0 "The Eastern Anbenncóst"
 R38_eastern_anbenncost_desc:0 "In the westward travels of Mashama Sanukelborlan, he mentions the great city that lay at the heart of Cannor’s great Raj, Anbenncóst, a place of boundless possibility that has captured the minds of many a Halessi artist, writer, or philosopher. Many have said that Sarisung is the rival to this Anbenncóst, but no more, for they shall speak of only one city in Haless to earn such a title: Sramaya, the great city of opportunity, where anyone with enough blood, sweat, and tears, can rise high and mightily."

 R38_branching_mission_3a_title:0 "Branching Mission"
 R38_branching_mission_3a_desc:0 "This mission will be revealed later, and its contents will change depending on whether we are §YHigh Philosophy§! or §YSuhan's Praxis§!"

 R38_spread_the_word_title:0 "Spread the Word..."
 R38_spread_the_word_desc:0 "With our acceptance of Suhan’s truth, it is time to bring it to the masses. We shall gather with our fellows and debate them as Suhan would, show them the light of Praxis and banish the old darkness from their minds."
 
 R38_an_inconvenient_truth_title:0 "An Inconvenient Truth"
 R38_an_inconvenient_truth_desc:0 "The doddering old fool, Suhan, speaks to the masses of ‘truth’, forsaking ancient wisdom of our ancestors in exchange for the chaos and bedlam he seeks to bring upon us all. No, we shall take a stand against this madness, whatever it takes, we will not give in to such ideas."

 R38_in_search_better_branching_title:0 "In Search of a Better Life"
 R38_in_search_better_branching_desc:0 "In light of Suhan's speech and the recent introduction of the J. Perakha exams, our nation has experienced a surge of recruits volunteering for induction into the Adasa Academies. Swayed by the prospect of social advancement afforded by association with being Adasa, our reliance upon slavery to fill our regiments has been somewhat alleviated. In time the upper castes will come around to the idea of supporting such a system, especially considering the significant boosts to recruitment and reduced hostility to our rule."

 R38_perfect_praxis_title:0 "Perfect Praxis"
 R38_perfect_praxis_desc:0 "Through both our debates and the mass printing of pamphlets across Haless, we have finally spread the Praxis to all corners of the land, from Rahen to Yanshen, all can readily read the words of Guru Suhan and likeminded thinkers, understand that they need not restrict themselves by heritage, that they should instead rise to their abilities, for that is the truth of our nation, that service guarantees reward."

 R38_political_philosophy_title:0 "Political Philosophy"
 R38_political_philosophy_desc:0 "Through both negotiating with the moderates and cracking down on those zealous firebrands, we have finally suppressed the spread of Guru Suhan’s aberration of the Philosophy and brought things back to normalcy. No more will the ancient order be threatened by radicals and fools, and we can go back to cultivating harmony in our castes."
 
 R38_open_the_gate_title:0 "Open the Gate"
 R38_open_the_gate_desc:0 "Every day, more and more travelers arrive from the distant lands of Cannor, and while this is mostly just new trade partners or explorers, some bring interesting new advancements, namely that of Artificery. Most of the Cannorian Artificers we’ve met are strange fellows called Gnomes, but many are humans, elves, or half elves. If we embrace these newcomers, it would greatly bolster our own Artificery, while providing trade routes across the world."
 
 R38_modern_metallurgy_title:0 "Model Metallurgy"
 R38_modern_metallurgy_desc:0 "The mountains and hills of our lands are full of ores and metals that our state hungers for deeply. Iron for swords and shackles, gold and silver for coinage, and copper for our cannons. We shall delve ever deeper, mine ever further, and extract ever more than our predecessors could. The markets shall want for nothing!"
 
 R38_luna_eclipsed_title:0 "Luna Eclipsed"
 R38_luna_eclipsed_desc:0 "In centuries past they have spoken of many great routes of commerce: the Alen, the Yanhe, and the Luna. But we have surpassed them all, turned a crew of escaped slaves into an empire that not only conquers, but creates, uplifts, brings hope and prosperity to its subject according to each of their merits.\n\n We are the greatest nation on Halann, who everyone looks to in awe, respect, and terror. Now and forevermore, they shall speak of the children of the great brass dragon: Bhuvauri"
 
 R38_accommodate_new_students_title:0 "Accommodate New Students"
 R38_accommodate_new_students_desc:0 "Every day, more and more students arrive at our schools, and for the first time ever, we are running out of places to put them in. This obviously cannot stand, so we must construct more places of learning and pass reforms to streamline this process. Whether labor or knowledge, any who can and want to serve Bhuvauri must be able to do so unimpeded."
 
 R38_meritorious_ministries_title:0 "Meritorious Ministries"
 R38_meritorious_ministries_desc:0 "With Rhamitra, we now have the Ministries of the Harimraj, though it could use much needed reform to reach its peak. Not only should we build new facilities along its ancient halls, but we should also seek to add our streak of meritocracy to it, to ensure the ministries are stocked with only the best of the best."
 
 R38_raheni_regiments_title:0 "Raheni Regiments"
 R38_raheni_regiments_desc:0 "As we reign over such an expansive territory, it is time to better make use of the manpower potential. The lower castes must be let into the Adasa Academies, with investments into new campuses to handle the influx. While no doubt the upper castes will rail against such actions, we are prepared to deal with them."
 
 R38_other_half_title:0 "The Other Half"
 R38_other_half_desc:0 "For untold millenia, it has been the men who fight and rule, while women relegated to motherhood and other such roles. But we are a state of Merit, where anyone can rise to their abilities, why should we limit ourselves? By uplifting women to the same status, we could double our manpower pools, while also ensuring exceptional individuals of all origins are not wasted by foolish tradition."
 
 R38_representative_government_title:0 "Representative Government"
 R38_representative_government_desc:0 "In the early days, it was easy for our state to govern the meagre lands we held around the Kharunyana Delta, now it is a lot more difficult. Not only is our territory vast, it is extremely diverse, with dozens of cultures all with their own needs and traditions, and as we impose ourselves upon them, they push back. The solution, it is determined, is to allow locals to rise through the ranks and administrate their home territories. Not only would they make more efficient bureaucrats, they would also be able to better ensure the loyalty of their fellows."
 
 R38_advance_the_administration_title:0 "Advance the Administration"
 R38_advance_the_administration_desc:0 "It is time to go one step further. Not only will we ensure locals can represent themselves in government, we will allow other races to enter the Upper Castes, in accordance with their ability. Can an orc not administrate? Can a Hobgoblin not pray? While many in the Upper Castes of course bemoan such an idea, they cannot hold us back."
 
 R38_cinnabar_bridge_system_title:0 "Cinnabar Bridge System"
 R38_cinnabar_bridge_system_desc:0 "With the success of our recent reform in abandoning seniority, it is also time we create a better system for the Adasa Academies, the actual content of which has become rather old as of late. By convening with both the Lower Castes and the cities of Endhuvi and Phangban, we should be able to create a better system for training recruits. Our administration will have to work for it, but the rewards of empowering our populace cannot be understated."
 
 R38_safe_last_title:0 "Safe at Last"
 R38_safe_last_desc:0 "Once, we were a small, scared group of former slaves at the edge of Rahen, clinging to life in the midst of war via enslaving others to fill our ranks. No more. We stand as a hegemon, remade the world with us at its centre, and it is time to do away with the concept of slavery. No longer is there a need for it, for all serve the state now, not via the whip and the chain, but via the academy and the meritocracy. No one is a slave. Everyone is a servant."
 
 R38_clean_the_stain_title:0 "Clean the Stain"
 R38_clean_the_stain_desc:0 "To truly right our past wrongs, we must ensure no one is left without recompense for the system we have now reformed. Reperations in great sums to ensure no one goes unwanting, and to wipe away our inconvenient reputation as the greatest slave market on Halann. It drives away many of our best customers, of course."

 flavor_bhuvauri.1.t:0 "The Great Ishudhen Typhoon"
 flavor_bhuvauri.1.desc:0 "When great white clouds were first spotted off the coasts of Ishuden, few paid them more than a passing glance. The war against Bim Lau was going well, the city of Bieng Phang had fallen, and trade was good. When it was clear that what had previously looked like telltale signs of a mild seasonal squall was in truth the herald of the most vicious storm to ever ravage the coast of Rahen, it was too late.\n\nLasting just over a week and striking across the Kharunyana delta with a brutality the never before seen, the Great Ishuden Cyclone mercilessly swept anyone and anything it grasped out to sea. With hundreds of thousands going missing, and drowned bodies continuing to wash ashore from the shattered remains of the delta, we had no choice but to recall our forces and settle merely for Bieng Phang and a jungle swarming with recalcitrant heathens. The battered and broken silk and spice plantations now lay silent.\n\nThe storm has finally passed, but the recovery will be a long and hard process. We must persevere as our fathers did under the Raja’s yoke. For if we do not, we shall be swept away, not by a storm, but by the tides of history."

 flavor_bhuvauri.2.t:0 "The Great Ishudhen Typhoon"
 flavor_bhuvauri.2.desc:0 "In 1444, Ishuden and its surrounding area was devastated by great hurricanes and flooding unlike the seasonal monsoons of years prior, a disaster far greater  than any seen since the Day of Ashen Skies itself, though it mercifully passed by the rest of the Kharaunyana Coast with little distinction. Were it not for the horrific sight of debris and bodies washing ashore, we would have assumed that the storms were no different from its predecessors. Now that the worst has some to pass, it is time for the survivors to repair the damage and grant the dead a proper burial."

 flavor_bhuvauri.3.desc:0 "The previous Adesadata's term draws to a close, and the time has come to select a new leader for Bhuvauri's armies. This works by selecting a candidate from one of the three houses of Bhuvauri. There is the Dakinshi house of Sky-Eyes, spiritual and mysterious. The Bulwari house of Szel-Azka, pragmatic and tolerant. And the Fangaulan house of Sanukelborlan, militaristic and belligerent. Power rotates between the three families; who shall come next?"

 flavor_bhuvauri.6.desc:0 "Despite the ongoing tension between the Bhuvauri foreign cultured elite, and the native populace, they are united in one thing; Their loathing of Piracy.\n\n As such, it is no mystery as to why the red haired evils Prukakhin are considered the most wicked of men. Not only to they raid and plunder, but it was they who drove the elephants of Bomdam extinct, a crime the house of Sky-Eyes found especially appalling due to believing the animal to be one of the most sacred.\n\nAs such, they have taken a great deal of righteous joy in showing the men of Prukakhin the error of their ways. Suffice to say, the floating city of Prukakhin was devastated, and the sight of the former lord of Prukakhin being tossed between execution elephants both natural and shape-shifted brought tears of mirth and happiness to the cheeks of many of those present."

They hoped to gain wealth, enough to retake their lost home or at least protect their last bastion of power. However, as they attacked our ships, stealing the cargo destined for the academies. They signed their own death warrant.\n\nTheir island burns, their homes are ransacked and looted, and their people are huddled in chains. And with the plunging of the last old sun below the waves, we will no longer have ships we send west be bothered by such parasites. At the end of the day, slaves are slaves, and the Academies will have its due."

With our subjigation of them, however, comes a rather unique conundrum. Usually we would just add their children to the Academies, but their ability to fly makes it difficult to enslave them. As such, we have come up with three possible solutions. We could drive them off, of course, but that would take resources and be distasteful for many of us. Or we could make a deal with them, that in exchange for letting them keep their mountains, we will have the coast to ensure no pirate will harm our ships."

He was flocked by followers, a raheni woman at his side, a hand on her blade. As a crowd gathered, either curious or wary, Suhan spoke. He gave a speech, similar to many others he had given in his long life of philosophy and debate within the halls of Rahen, woes against the stagnation of one’s place in life, despite their deed or character.\n\n"And yet," he said, a glimmer of hope in those old eyes of his, "In this city of slaves and slavers, I see promise. The Academies, the Three Families, through these even the lowest can rise high, enlightened and educated via their own merits. I dare say that this is the only place in Rahen where this is so."\n\nAs his speech ended, and silence drew over the crowd, there was a pause. And then the riots began, dissent emboldened by Suhan’s words, a spark had been lit within Sramaya that couldn’t be halted even as the streets were brought back under order at spearpoint. Something has changed in Bhuvauri, and there is only the question of if we embrace or reject it."

 flavor_bhuvauri.20.desc:0 "The Adasa Academies were born of desperation. When the rebellion had won, and Bhuvauri had been born, the Raj and Bom scorned the slaves, and threatened invasion and subjugation. With this great threat, our forefathers reestablished the slave trade to gain soldiers from Fangaula, Bulwar, and Bwa Dakinshi, so that they may defend what they had fought so hard to win. Within this system it was decreed that no native born of Rahen or Bomdan would be able to partake in the Academies and therefore get a chance to rise through the ranks of state.\n\nNow, with our independence and security more certain, and the growing numbers of Raheni and Bom within our state, calls for opening this system up to the masses have grown louder and louder. And increasingly from within the Three Families themselves, some have seen the benefit to introducing large supplies of manpower to the Adasa. After all, why should we limit ourselves based on the circumstances of forebearers?"
