  #Column 1
  Y72_hidden_gems_title:0 "Hidden Gems"
  Y72_hidden_gems_desc:0 "We have heard rumours of gemstones that can be grown within the Lupulan Rainforest.  While the likelihood of there being a similar deposit of precious rocks to our own is small, it is still worth learning more about.  Let us seed spies among merchants of great influence to find these gems."
  Y72_curio_expedition_title:0 "The Curio Expedition"
  Y72_curio_expedition_desc:0 "With the recent completion of several military outposts on the outskirts of the Lupulan, we can begin to send out larger exploration teams in our search for these mysterious gems.  Using a system of quadranting, we can comb the jungle carefully and avoid missing anything."
  Y72_military_expedition_title:0 "The Military Expedition"
  Y72_military_expedition_desc:0 "Armed with the intelligence gathered by our exploration teams, the time has come for us to assert our dominance over the rainforest and the tribes who live there. Let us depose their so-called "Kings" and bring their misguided followers into our nation."
  Y72_offer_amongst_forest_title:0 "Offer Amongst the Forest"
  Y72_offer_amongst_forest_desc:0 "With the rebellion crushed our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should be rejoicing, but all they can think about is the whispers they have been hearing within the forest. "Endless power I shall bestow to thee, in exchange for aid you give unto me…" "
  Y72_hidden_1_title:0 "Hidden Mission"
  Y72_hidden_1_desc:0 "Our path has yet to be determined."
  Y72_hidden_2_title:0 "Hidden Mission"
  Y72_hidden_2_desc:0 "Our path has yet to be determined."
  Y72_hidden_3_title:0 "Hidden Mission"
  Y72_hidden_3_desc:0 "Our path has yet to be determined."
  Y72_tradition_power_title:0 "Tradition over Power"
  Y72_tradition_power_desc:0 "While our Anroang is not convinced the so-called "spirit" wasn't a trick of the mind, they have announced a number of new festivals in celebration of our rich and unique cultural heritage. The Festival of the Stranger, traditionally celebrated only in rural areas, was always a festival of propitiation and fear, aimed to prevent hostile spirits from taking offence at a poor welcome. The Night of Hungry Winds, though less at odds with spirits, also betrays a note of fear. Let us turn these occasions into joyous feasts, and invite our spirit brethren in from the cold."
  Y72_matter_chi_title:0 "The Matter of Chi"
  Y72_matter_chi_desc:0 "The recent communication between our state and the many spirits has led to the clergy to question the true nature of chi, and how it relates to the spirit plane and the philosophies of a good human life.  Normally such thought would be kept within the monasteries, however the Anroang has taken a newfound interest in theology since her encounter with the spirit in the forest, so let this public debate be funded and known!"
  Y72_oppressors_servants_title:0 "Planar Equality"
  Y72_oppressors_servants_desc:0 "Let it be known that from this day forth, by order of our great Anroang, both humans and spirits are equals in our great nation! Let these spirits come and walk among us, manifesting themselves once more on this physical plane!"
  Y72_learn_from_locals_title:0 "Learn from the Locals"
  Y72_learn_from_locals_desc:0 "While many in our state have begun to adopt the traditions of the Mystic Accord, our understanding of many practices is lacking. We should seek to understand how other followers of the faith in the Lupulan revere the Great Spirits and learn from them."
  Y72_queens_decree_title:0 "The Queen's Decree"
  Y72_queens_decree_desc:0 "With a greater knowledge and understanding of the great spirits, it is time our Anroang proclaims the worship of these spirits the official religion of our nation state. It is time for us to publicly embrace the ways of the Mystic Accord."
  Y72_temple_throne_title:0 "Not a Temple, A Throne"
  Y72_temple_throne_desc:0 "With our conversion to the Mystic Accord underway, it is time we shatter the temple wards holding back our beloved spirits in Nha Nuhoanha. We will transform this temple into a glorious new palace for our Anroangs and welcome the spirits into it!"
  
  #Column 2
  Y72_sharpen_boars_tusks_title:0 "Sharpen the Boar's Tusks"
  Y72_sharpen_boars_tusks_desc:0 "A segment of our military known as ‘The Boars of Dinh’ have proven themselves time and time again in honor of our Anroang.  Devoting their lives to be a stalwart troop of melee prowess, they deserve to be placed separate from the rest of the army as an elite company."
  Y72_end_raiders_title:0 "End the Raiders"
  Y72_end_raiders_desc:0 "The desert raiders of Sirtan have long been a thorn in our great nation's side. Sirtani pillagers tear through the Binhrung countryside, setting fire to villages within the Binhrunghin valley and ripping love ones from each other's arms.  It is time we rid ourselves of this nuisance."
  Y72_drive_elf_lovers_out_title:0 "Drive the Elf-Lovers Out!"
  Y72_drive_elf_lovers_out_desc:0 "Arawkelin rises in power in the south, burning down the great rainforests as they do so. We should check their growth so they will not become a threat, and help preserve the rainforest in the process."
  Y72_help_from_beyond_title:0 "Help from Beyond"
  Y72_help_from_beyond_desc:0 "While we have stopped Arawkelin's immediate rise to power, the rainforests they own still burn. The spirits of the rainforest call for our aid, and we will answer."
  Y72_seize_coastline_title:0 "Seize the Coastline"
  Y72_seize_coastline_desc:0 "With the rainforests secured, it is time we seize the coastline and the cities located there. In doing so, we shall cement our claim as rulers of the Lupulan, and secure our southern border once and for all."
  Y72_reconnect_heritage_title:0 "Reconnect our Heritage"
  Y72_reconnect_heritage_desc:0 "The beast of industrialisation rages in our lands, and maintaining a balance between it and nature is a fine line we walk. In the midst of this, our people have begun returning to our ancestral home on the jungle's fringes."

  #Column 3
  Y72_avenge_our_queen_title:0 "Avenge Our Queen"
  Y72_avenge_our_queen_desc:0 "One war ends, and with it the Unkillable Kai lies beaten and bleeding. The Anroang has ensured that our people's memory shall endure, but she looks now to her environs. The ethereal emperor of Hon Sai yet lingers, but the court whispers that his presence ebbs by the day. The Kai remain divided, and the Mountain King sneers from a throne built on the backs of the Hinphat. Their time will come. For now, we will recover."
  Y72_unite_old_kingdom_title:0 "Unite the Old Kingdom"
  Y72_unite_old_kingdom_desc:0 "Duyen is avenged. We have routed the last of Kudet Kai's forces. While this loathsome state has proven time and time again to be capable of naught but destruction, its people can be redeemed. The Binhrung shall accept them as our rightful subjects, and soon Kudet Kai will be nothing more than a memory to Haless."
  Y72_mountain_kings_servants_title:0 "The Mountain King's Servants"
  Y72_mountain_kings_servants_desc:0 "The Mountain King trembles before the Anroang, surrounded by swaths of his Hinphat sycophants. As she lifts her arms to bring her warhammer down, they gasp in horror, held back by our soldiers - but it is his nephrite crown that is broken. She stretches a hand out to the crownless dwarf, and he rises shakily. The disbelief of the Hinphat turns, slowly, to awe. Perhaps even the lowliest people can be shown the way, in time. With our guidance, master and servant become equals."
  Y72_laid_to_rest_title:0 "Laid to Rest"
  Y72_laid_to_rest_desc:0 "The tides of change have shifted. The Khom Civil War is past us now. As the Ghostly Emperor fades, so too does his state; we shall give it a proper burial. With this threat to our hegemony dispelled, we stand poised to unify the Kai under the guidance of our noble and righteous Anroang."
  Y72_rein_in_townships_title:0 "Rein in the Townships"
  Y72_rein_in_townships_desc:0 "While the Kai townships boast great political freedom, they are incapable of protecting themselves from the chaos and instability that freedom brings. As protectors of the Kai, we must intervene and bring them stability and security."
  Y72_rulers_yanglam_kai_title:0 "Rulers of the Yanglam & Kai"
  Y72_rulers_yanglam_kai_desc:0 "We have achieved our goals and are now the defenders of the Kai and Langlam peoples. We are united and prosperous, and yet our Anroang feels…unsatisfied. Now still the look with hungry eyes beyond our borders, an Imperial dream, and a voice relentlessly whispering "an endless desire power is, more of it we always need."."
  Y72_reforged_crown_title:0 "The Reforged Crown"
  Y72_reforged_crown_desc:0 "The Anroang arrives in the great palace to meet with her ancestors. Taken in by the scent of low-cooked beef, stirred with spinach and savory fish sauce, it is a glorious day of festivities and mirth. Our people, protected and content, celebrate our great empire and all its achievements, and the great Anroangs of old celebrate with us, for at long last, both spirit and mortal have a place to live in unity."
  
  #Column 4
  Y72_reopen_gem_caves_title:0 "Reopen the Gem Caves"
  Y72_reopen_gem_caves_desc:0 "The recent earthquake in Keoaden has closed off many of the lower tunnels and caves in our mines. With the Khom Civil War over, it is time we turn our focus on reopening these levels."
  Y72_eyes_open_trade_title:0 "Eyes over Open Trade"
  Y72_eyes_open_trade_desc:0 "With the discovery of gemstones with significant magical potential, our Anroang has decreed that there will be additional oversight of the gem trade in our major cities."
  Y72_untouched_hillsides_title:0 "Untouched Hillsides"
  Y72_untouched_hillsides_desc:0 "Historicially, precious rocks have held all sorts of symbolism for Chien Binhrung; They are a sign of nobility, a material used for burial, and a lucrative trade export.  If we want to fuel the latter use for gems in our kingdom, we need to discover more deposits of precious rocks throughout our realm."
  Y72_precious_rocks_title:0 "Around Haless in 80 Months"
  Y72_precious_rocks_desc:0 "The discovery of gems laced with magic has led to a surge of curiosity within the Binhrung court. Could there be other gem deposits in Haless that boost magic potential?  Could other arcane gems be used to better commune with the Spitirual Anroangs?  To learn more, we should fund a daring continent-wide expedition across the region in search of other rumored deposits of ‘Magic Gems."
  Y72_hold_within_mine_title:0 "A Hold within a Mine"
  Y72_hold_within_mine_desc:0 "With Verkal Ozovar taken, we are presented a unique opportunity. While we have no use for a hold, we do have use for the vast minerals in the mountain. With the help of the local Dwarven clans, we shall convert Verkal Ozovar into the largest mine in all Haless."
  Y72_incorporate_ozovar_weapons_title:0 "Unbreakable Steel"
  Y72_incorporate_ozovar_weapons_desc:0 "Recent insights from expeditions in Verkal Ozovar have yielded us breakthroughs in armoursmithing. These combined with our renowned gem-encrusted armour has culminated with our soldiers being protected with some of the best armour in Haless!"
  Y72_invulnerable_hearts_title:0 "Invulnerable Hearts"
  Y72_invulnerable_hearts_desc:0 "Born from the fires of war, military leaders have always held great influence in our court. We have thrived best when the military is integrated into the core of our policies and doctrines. This integration has begun to manifest in our generals becoming the face of our armies. Let us work with them to cultivate our ideals in our military tactics and strategies."
  Y72_new_interrogation_title:0 "Interrogation Tactics"
  Y72_new_interrogation_desc:0 "We have long crystalised our Anroangs when they die to tie their spirits to the physical realm, in hopes they will aid us in times of crisis.  The precious Jade stone has, however, long been a stained gem after the infamous ‘Foul Speared’ Anroang was crystalised with it. We can use this process as a great deterrent against rebellious elements. Nobody wants a hand made of Jade after all…"
  Y72_heirs_thindikai_title:0 "True Heirs to Thindikai"
  Y72_heirs_thindikai_desc:0 "From humble beginnings we have flourished, and we now stand as the successors of Thidinkai. Our court is ecstatic, yet hungry for more, and ambitions fester in shadowed corners. Our people rejoice, for we have brought them peace, security, and prosperity, and so they are happy. And our Spirit Queens are proud, for we have realised their dreams and ambitions, and they walk amongst us, with smiles of pride on their hallowed faces."
  
  #Column 5
  Y72_coronation_title:0 "$MONARCH$'s Coronation"
  Y72_coronation_desc:0 "With the Khom Civil War over, it is time for us to focus on our internal affairs, beginning with the coronation of our Anroang! A coronation of the grandest proportions is in order, given that our people have dealt a crushing blow to our hated enemies in Kudet Kai."
  Y72_visit_temple_title:0 "A Visit to the Temple"
  Y72_visit_temple_desc:0 "Chien Binhrung is in an interesting position. While we may have bested our enemies in the Khom Civil War, our position as a regional power is still tenuous. Falter but a little, and all may come undone. Searching for counsel on how to proceed, our Anroang will visit the Nha Nuhoanha temple, seeking out the wisdom of rulers past."
  Y72_meeting_with_knives_title:0 "A Meeting with the Knives"
  Y72_meeting_with_knives_desc:0 "Our Anroang sits in the council chamber surrounded by master spymasters and assassins, gained from the dismantling of many of the estates' former networks. Now these networks should be utilised by the state to subvert the power of the nobles and dispel independence movements through propaganda."
  Y72_nrpd_title:0 "The NRPD Overseers"
  Y72_nrpd_desc:0 "With our increasing oversight of the trading activities within our state, some are beginning to question how open and free our trade is. We must invoke some creative tactics in order to maintain our facade of open trade. Thus, the Anroang has founded the National Resource Protection Division."
  Y72_end_noble_merchant_title:0 "End the Estate's Feuds"
  Y72_end_noble_merchant_desc:0 "The clergy have long been loyal to the crown, with their power having been broken after a failed attempt to create a Eunuch state akin to those in Yanshen. The nobility and merchants, however, are not so loyal, often using the turmoil of succession to further their own agendas, press old rivalries and consolidate power. While our spys have allowed us to check their power, perhaps it is time the status quo became more to our liking…"
  Y72_sapphire_declaration_title:0 "The Sapphire Declaration"
  Y72_sapphire_declaration_desc:0 "We have been taking steps to limit the estates' influence recently, but now it is time we end this charade. Let us break the power of the estates so they can never again presume to have authority. There is only one authority in our nation, and it is our Anroang."
  Y72_bejeweled_city_title:0 "A Bejeweled City"
  Y72_bejeweled_city_desc:0 "Keoaden started with humble roots, founded after gems were discovered in the Northern hills, nestled in the shadows of the Nha Nohoanha temple complex. After dwarven migrants to the town helped establish the mines, gemstones have dominated both the city’s culture and its exports. Thanks to clever manoeuvering, strong leadership, and aid from the spirit queens, Chien Binhrung has ascended to its rightful place holding dominion over all of South Haless, gathering a crown of great cities in the process. However, none shine brighter than Keoaden, the crown jewel of our Empire, and the place where it all began."
  
##Events (Hey if your reading this, remind me not to ever write MT loc again, thanks ~Everest)
  flavor_chien.1.t:0 "Ending the Blood Feud"
  flavor_chien.1.d:0 "To Kudet Kai, Anroang Duyen has long served as a trophy. She was first slain, then ridiculed, then confined to a funerary urn. With the disgrace of her erstwhile captors, we prepared to welcome her body to its rightful place in Nha Nuhoanha Temple. As our soldiers breached the walls of Nirakvondikai accompanied by our Anroang herself, they sang songs of vengeance and triumph. The city's mortuary sanctum, once proud, now ran red with the blood of the so-called Unkillable Kai. In victory, however, came a crushing revelation.\n\nDuyen's urn is not here.\n\nPanic turned to terrible purpose. Nirakvondikai burned bright that night."
  flavor_chien.1.a:0 "...A query for later.  For now, we must rest."
  flavor_chien.2.t:0 "A Pointless Chase"
  flavor_chien.2.d:0 "The Binhrung soldiers were having a difficult time, navigating the many halls and corners of the Nephrite Hold.  Not only was the underground city a labyrinthine complex of alleyways and structures, but the local population wasn’t exactly keen on assisting their recent conquerors.\n\nThe Soldiers were not just patrolling Verkal Ozovar, however.  Anroang [Root.Monarch.GetName] had assigned multiple contingents of troops on one of many leads related to Duyen’s Urn, which was so silently ripped from our nation’s grasp during the Razing of Nirakvondikai.  Rumors abound that a few loyal remnants of Kudet Kai entrusted the Urn to be taken through the hold, though the direction they went, or the building they hid, remained a mystery.\n\nThe longer Duyen’s Urn was left undiscovered, the more time these ruffians had to whisk away into the shadows.  Though the reason for this expansive search was not abundantly clear, the Urn had become the Anroang’s highest priority."
  flavor_chien.2.a:0 "Time is of the Essence"
  flavor_chien.3.t:0 "Phasmophobia"
  flavor_chien.3.d:0 "Of course.\n\nThe Ghostly visage of Sang Caoban, who had so selfishly clung to power, had been the mastermind behind Duyen’s disappearance all this time.  It was he who had people sneak into Nirakvondikai in the night, robbing us of the remains of our beloved ruler.  It was he who tried to deceive our soldiers through the halls of Verkal Ozovar, throwing false leads and rumors to throw us off.  Now the urn rests in his palace, mere steps away from where his incorporeal form stands hauntingly before Anroang [Root.Monarch.GetName] now.\n\nTo [Root.Monarch.GetName], it did not matter what the purpose behind this thievery was.  It did not matter how the Ghost Emperor planned to desecrate Duyen with his foul magic.  All that mattered was that the urn would shortly be returned to the royal palace in Keoaden, and that Caoban’s corrupted unlife was put to an end."
  flavor_chien.3.d1:0 "Of course.\n\nThe Ghostly visage of Sang Caoban, who had so selfishly clung to power, had been the mastermind behind Duyen’s disappearance all this time.  It was he who had people sneak into Nirakvondikai in the night, robbing us of the remains of our beloved ruler.  It was he who tried to deceive our soldiers through the halls of Verkal Ozovar, throwing false leads and rumors to throw us off.  Now the urn rests in his palace, discarded among many other trinkets and baubles, its prior purpose lost when the Ghost Emperor passed on.\n\nAnroang [Root.Monarch.GetName] had ordered the Boars of Dinh to carefully sweep the palace for any other loyalists to the deceased emperor’s cause, while she proceeded to grab the urn so delicately, caressing it in a full embrace.\n\n"Beloved Ancestor", Anroang [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared, "You will be home soon.""
  flavor_chien.3.a:0 "The Hunt is Over."
  flavor_chien.4.t:0 "A Curious Find"
  flavor_chien.4.d:0 "The hills north of Keoaden are dotted with an intricate network of mineshafts, excavating the precious rocks that fill both the caverns below the earth and the pockets of Binhrung merchants.  Normally, the mines would be rife with activity, however, as if coinciding with the Khom Civil War, a massive cave-in caused much of the mining system to shut down.\n\nLuckily, that time is behind us, and a fine mix of garnets, topazes, and rubies are being mined out of the system once again.  Our fine [Root.Monarch.GetName] was visiting one of the more prominent mines when the manager of the complex, a Dwarven merchant sporting a brown beard laced with sapphires, approached our Anroang.\n\n"Esteemed Ruler, we bring astonishing news; Some of the gems found deep in the earth seem to house a strange energy to them!  A hired mage seems to believe that this ruby is holding a faint trace of the arcane!"\n\nIf this is true, it could be a great conduit for our ruler, or a good way to raise prices on gems…"
  flavor_chien.4.a:0 "Magic is value, let's find some bidding merchants!"
  flavor_chien.4.b:0 "Only our Queen shall know of this."
  flavor_chien.5.t:0 "Not a Plea, Nor a Demand"
  flavor_chien.5.d:0 "It’s a quiet voice, one that utters barely a whisper in the dense jungles of the Lupulan.\n\nIt calls to our ruler, as if the voice knows her importance.\n\nAs the royal guard marches through the stormy day, the Anroang stops, listening to a sequence  of sounds forming a few phrases of common.\n\nThe sounds echo a fire, raging through the rainforest in the south\n\nThe fire roars with malice, that of a thousand souls writhing in pain\n\nThe souls dissolve into a whisper once more.\n\nThey afford an accord."
  flavor_chien.5.a:0 "I Accept."
  flavor_chien.5.b:0 "I Refuse."
  flavor_chien.6.t:0 "Coronation of the Anroang"
  flavor_chien.6.d:0 "Everything was in order.  The crowd, composed of citizens from the lowliest peasant to a distant noble, all eagerly awaited the Anroang’s entrance.  Now that the kingdom was at peace, the long-awaited formal ascension of [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the top priority of the Binhrung court and people.  Old and young alike gathered within the courtroom of the Royal Palace, waiting for their ruler.\n\nFrom the adjoining room behind the throne, the [Root.Monarch.GetName] appeared.  Adorning a red Yansheni-silk garb, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] positioned herself to the front of the gem-encrusted throne.  All in attendance bowed their heads as the Anroang made her declaration:\n\n"My loyal subjects, it has been a long journey to reach today's events.  I inherited the honor of ruling our kingdom in a time of war and strife.  I have fought side-by-side with our soldiers as we put an end to the scheming Pulutan in Kudet Kai and the unruly son of the Caoban dynasty.  I have learned the chaotic force that rips through the Kai people, and intend to not let this lawlessness infect our great society!"\n\n"It is thanks to the women and men of our army that today I shall stand before you properly.  Not as an incumbent, nor as a general.  With our greatest enemy defeated, I may now officially call you my brave subjects, and you may call me Anroang [Root.Monarch.GetName]!""
  flavor_chien.6.a:0 "Long Live Anroang [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
  flavor_chien.7.t:0 "Where the Crystal Stares Back"
  flavor_chien.7.d:0 "One year after the Day of Ashen Skies, our first ruler, Jinmari, had nearly finished a campaign of conquest that saw the Binhrung people flee the Lupulan rainforest and settle a home in the lands we rule today.  An aggressive and militant ruler, Jinmari marched onto a sleepy village at midday, expecting the settlement to submit to her rule once she put the village head at the end of a sword.  Instead, she was approached by a lowly shaman, wearing tattered cloth and a few necklaces of small gems.  Jinmari demanded that the shaman move out of her way, but instead, a quiet hum began to reverberate around the area.  Jinmari tried to step forward to slice the head of her adversary clean off, but found she couldn’t move.  Her legs morphed from flesh and armor to a reflective, clean stone with a red hue.  Within seconds, the leader of the Binhrung people was transmuted into a ruby statue, unmoving.\n\nSince then, all Anroangs at the end of their life volunteer their body and soul to be ‘crystalized’ into statues, in honor of the first ruler of our kingdom.  The statues are displayed at the front of the Nha Nuhoanha temple, symbolizing the past rulers of our kingdom never ceasing their watch over us.\n\nBut there’s an old fairytale about Chien Binhrung’s former Anroangs; that one day, the spirits of Chien Binhrung’s last rulers will rise from their petrified cages and save the kingdom in its hour of need.  [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not believe in this fairytale initially.  But after weeks of hearing strange, regal voices in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dreams, all directing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] to the Nha Nuhoanha temple, the Anroang has thrown superstitious disbelief to the wind, and marched [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] to the front of the temple in the dead of night.  [Root.Monarch.GetName] moves in between numerous Anroang’s, before stopping right before the entrance, with Jinmari’s statue on the left of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].  [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looks at her millennia-old ancestor, and utters a soft few words before walking inside;"
  flavor_chien.7.a:0 ""If you are speaking to me now... then our kingdom needs your help.""
  flavor_chien.8.t:0 "A Restful Reign"
  flavor_chien.8.d:0 ""Is that really it?"  Anroang [Root.Monarch.GetName] exclaims.\n\n"Yes, Anroang."  Knife Tuan replies in a matter-of-fact tone, "There have only been 2 instances of attempted assassinations by nobility since you ascended the throne.  One of which was orchestrated by you, I might add."\n\nThe ruler of Chien Binhrung gives a small sigh of relief, before straightening her expression and enunciating her voice to the other figures in the room, "And you are certain that there have been no high-profile bribes within the court?  None at all?"\n\nOne of the figures steps forward, "Your advisors and retainers have remained clean, Anroang." Knife Duy Dieu replies calmly, "The Merchants Guild holds as much sway in the court as you allow them."\n\n"We believe that the internal factions within our kingdom are not confident in forming any schemes that directly conflict with you." Knife Tuan interjects, "Your recent anti-corruption push, and a few silenced agitators worry them."\n\nPart of [Root.Monarch.GetName] believed this was too good to be true.  Since the days of Jaher’s invasion of Haless, the estates of Chien Binhrung have always vied against the Anroangs for further control over the kingdom.  Many of her ancestors have been victims of devious plots against the throne.  But maybe [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] doesn't have to worry about that."
  flavor_chien.8.a:0 ""Maybe I'm just doing a good job.""
  flavor_chien.9.t:0 "Jewel of Haless"
  flavor_chien.9.d:0 "The city of Keoaden held a small murmur in the wind.  The day had yet to rouse many of the denizens of the city to their daily routines, with the sky still yielding the pale blue that sunrise always brings.  In time, the people will take leave of their homes, their families, and meet and mingle across the sprawling city.  Once a small port in between Yanshen and the Ringlet Sea, Keoaden now spans throughout the coast, hugging the land between the imposing hills inland and the Ringlet Sea nearly to the horizon.  Scholars flock to the city’s university, and laborers process the many gems throughout the mining complex up north in the mills.  Perhaps in time, historians will consider this city to be a highlight of Halessi society, if they do not already."
  flavor_chien.9.a:0 "A Crystaline metropolis, and a Haven for our people."
  flavor_chien.10.t:0 "A Beautiful Morning"
  flavor_chien.10.d:0 "It was early morning when [Root.Monarch.GetName] woke up.  The last night was a joyous occasion, a great celebration of what has been accomplished by all Anroangs in the past few centuries.  All ambitions were complete; We had cemented our rule over the Yanglam and Kai people, we had monopolized the gem market with arcane gemstones, and we had ensure the Binhrung state would be secured from internal opposition.  [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood looking out into the morning sky, wondering what could be next for Chien Binhrung.\n\nIt was then when a sudden chill swept past [Root.Monarch.GetName], blowing into her room. Recognizing the meaning of this, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] turned around to greet her ancestor.  Only this time, it was not just one.  Nhitrac, Duyen, Ngoc, Suong, Huyen, and Jinmari all apparated around [Root.Monarch.GetName].  The living Anroang stared at each and every one of them, shocked to see all of them outside of the temple.  [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was even more shocked when they all bowed in front of her.  In unison, all six of the legendary Anroangs of Chien Binhrung said a phrase all subjects of the state utter:\n\n"Long Live Anroang [Root.Monarch.GetName]!""
  flavor_chien.10.a:0 "Thank you, Jinmari"
  flavor_chien.10.b:0 "Thank you, Ngoc"

  flavor_chien.10.g:0 "Thank you, Duyen"
  flavor_chien.11.t:0 "Around Haless in 80 Months"
  flavor_chien.11.d:0 "Keoaden, usually, was a quiet port compared to many large cities in Haless.  It did not have the sprawling infrastructure of Tianlou or Feiten, or the key geography of Arawkelin and Cây Cam Sinh.  Instead, it was a place in between ports where merchants could rest at while embarking to one of those aforementioned cities.\n\nToday, however, the port was bustling with activity.  A royal standard was perched atop a small fleet of ships, destined for lands far from home.  The Anroang, curious on the nature of the arcane gemstones found within the local mineshafts, has funded an expedition across Haless to learn about other gemstones known for strange properties.  Captain Triêu Thinh has been charged as the leader of the expedition, and it is up to her to decide which direction the fleet travels; Northward to Yanshen, or Southward to the Gulf of Rahen."

  flavor_chien.12.d:0 "The process for Spiritual Lapidary is simple.\n\nThe first stage involves entering the Nha Nuhoanha Temple alone, with a piece of jewelry that holds a precious rock imbued with some arcane power.  You approach an open, empty room, arms across your chest, hoping in your mind for a guiding voice.  If the call is received, then shut your eyes.  Your body will be led down a staircase once blind to your eye, and the smell of burning incense will engulf your senses.  Once you know it is time, open your eyes.\n\nBefore you lie the ghostly visages of the Great Queens of Chien Binhrung, heeding your call for help.  You will have the choice to commune with one of the heroes of the nation.  Each of them specializes in some form of nation-building, be it conquest, development, or internal affairs.  Once the choice is made, place the jewelry down. The chosen spirit will seem to envelop the jewel for a time.  Before long, the jewel will glow with a dim violet light, and the process will be complete.  The spirit will be able to lend you  consistent advice and mystical power, regardless of distance from the temple complex.\n\nAs the nation seems to rise in power, so too does the spirit queen’s ability to imbue clear knowledge and project greater power.\n\nNow, who will you choose to commune with?"

  flavor_chien.14.d:0 "Captain’s log, [GetDate].\n\nOur fleet found itself cautiously trending through the mouth of the Gulf of Rahen, weary of the many pirate fleets that roamed the area.  Unfortunately, we were not cautious enough, as one of our front ships blared the horn for being attacked.  Fortunately, however, these pirate were not in the business of ransaking us.\n\nThe commotion of a large fleet of Binhrung ships had not gone unnoticed, it seems.  The Naleni harpies of the Sarhaly Coast, known for their expertise in their ‘hostile acquiring’ of goods over sea, offered an interesting treatise to me; They’ll allow us, and future chien fleets, safe passage through the gulf, and in exchange we let them in on some of the goods we plan to grab for our Anroang.  As trying to bluff ignorance would likely lead to a sword at my throat, I could only accept.\n\nAs a token of good will (or a reminder of the deal we had to make), the Harpies handed us a small crate.  Inside were some amethysts from their homeland.  After our expedition’s appasier took a look, the gems were determined to house small illusion magic, making them look far shiner and more refined than they truly were.  Whether this was intended to scam us or to show interest in our expedition is unknown, but we accepted the crate regardless."

Our client was somewhere near the market, in an abandoned shop alongside the Telebei River.  This meeting had been planned by the Anroang for months, though the reasons why were kept secret from the expedition.\n\nI entered the abandoned shop with four guards accompanying me.  The locale was not ideal, however, our business had to be discreet.  We weren’t entirely sure how our Anroang came to know of an underground dealer selling ‘Life-sapping Opals’, but if our ruler was confident in the trade, then all we needed to do was carry it out.\n\nSurprisingly, the transaction was simple enough.  The client showed us the product, we handed the gold, and the exchange was made.  What wasn’t simple was the fatigue that all four guards and myself experienced as we moved back toward the ships.  At one point, a guard just collapsed on the ground with little warning.  I’m ordering the opals to be kept in a marked box at the end of one of the ships’ lower decks, but after feeling what they could do, I wonder what our Anroang would want to do with them."

The Kharunyana can be perilous, and we made frequent stops to survey the expedition for any damage to our ships.  By the time we reached the port nearest to Tughayasa, we had stopped by Sramaya and all of the porcelain cities before reaching the Rayavhatimana, our last stop before making the journey to Mount Tughayaasa.\n\nThe journey up the mountain took a few days, so when we arrived I was quick to seek an audience.  As we were sent to receive a prophecy on behalf of our kingdom, we considered ourselves to have a far more urgent matter than most.  The three days we had to wait argued otherwise.  When we finally managed to receive an audience with an augur, I prepared to ask them the many things I was requested to bring up, only for the augur to stop me before I could speak, hand me a stone wrapped in cloth, and say, "This holds the answers you seek."\n\n…As the augur walked away, I stood there, speechless.  I remained speechless as we walked away, and didn’t say a word when our appraiser confirmed that the augur handed me a diamond containing divination magic.  It wasn’t until one of my guards asked me what our next course was that I defeatedly replied;"

  flavor_chien.17.d:0 "Captain’s log, [GetDate].\n\nIt was not my original intent to have to send such a sizable contingent of the expedition inland, however, the promising letters related to the House of Fire & Water warranted we take a look.  For centuries, these individuals have claimed numerous inventions that have forwarded military society, from a ‘sticky’ fire that can bend metal to the discovery of charcoal.  Recently, we heard word that they may have discovered a way to ‘Cast fire and ice through stone’.  Sounded familiar enough to warrant a look.\n\nArriving at one of the guild’s more renowned houses, I went to speak with one of the members of the House as soon as possible.  While a bit alarmed at first, given the large group of armed guards behind me, I believe he calmed down significantly when he gazed upon the small box of gold I presented in my hand.\n\nThe guild member allowed us in, introducing us to their fellow members, who were frivolously writing notes on things I dared not try to understand.  After we inquired about their claims of a stone, they showed off a small collection of delicately refined sapphires.  The guild member who invited us in grabbed one, walked outside, and aimed the base of the sapphire at a small target.  To our amazement, a small crystal of ice appeared out of the stone and slammed at the target.  It seems the House of Fire & Water had found another gem with arcane abilities, this time evocation."

Legend has it that wearing one of these rubies grants the wearer the valor of a ‘Grown Jiantsang Harimari’, which I presume is supposed to imply significance.\n\nFinding a merchant selling the rubies was easy enough; We had merely to show our gold around to find a decent audience.  The difficult part was the payment.  The merchants we found would constantly demand outrageous prices for one ruby.  One even had the gall to offer to trade their ruby for one of the ships in our fleet!  Eventually, though, we found a seller with a relatively amicable price.\n\nThe ruby glistened a magnificent red in the sunlight, with fine edges shaped all around the piece.  Just holding onto it, I swore I felt… stronger, or more confident at the very least.  I may have just been imagining things, but the appraiser is studying it now, so maybe it hosts mild enchantment magic."

To say I was not enthused by the changing of weather throughout the year would be an understatement.  However, when we arrived at the shores of the Odheongun people, my spirits quickly shifted.  While noticeably different in terms of culture, seeing proper civilization after months of treacherous waters was a welcome sight.\n\nWe landed at the port of Buogoj and settled in, after receiving an audience with the local leader and explaining our presence, they mentioned how many of their shamans utilize emeralds as a catalyst for abjuration magic against the terrorizing Shuvüüsh raiders from the west.  I expressed interest, and before long we had arranged an agreement between our expedition and the Jongsoeta shamans; We would receive a small number of these abjuring emeralds, and in turn, the shamans requested payment and insight into anything we learned about other arcane gemstones.
