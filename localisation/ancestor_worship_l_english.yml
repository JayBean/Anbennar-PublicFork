 ancestor_worship_religion_desc:0 "The Dwarves have a great semi-mythologized history of various heroes, kings, and ancestors dating back to their creation by Halanna the Earth-Mother in the Tree of Stone caves. It is said that a hall of a hundred storytellers couldn't tell the full Dwarven folklore even if they had a hundred years to do it, and every hold has their own stories that are kept in carefully kept records. At one point, these stories were part of a wider belief in a dwarven pantheon, but most dwarves have lost their faith in the gods long ago as Aul-Dwarov fell, while the fall of that great empire only left behind more tragedies and tales of grandeur. While the great ancestors are worshipped and revered, they are not gods; they are reminders of what simple dwarven ingenuity, bravery and wisdom can achieve. Inspired by the heroes of old, many dwarves look towards the Dwarovar, All-Dwarves-Home, in order to reclaim the history and lands they have lost."

 ancestor_worship.1.d:0 "After rediscovering Gor Vazumbrog, tales have reached our ears of a great dwarf. Known as Krummul Orcslayer, he held the line against the orcish invasions into the Segbandal, and even ventured onto the surface world to aid the humans of Bulwar against an orcish incursion from Hul-Jorkad. After his passing, the dwarves of the old Segbandal raised him to a position of great honour on their shrines, as one of the Great Ancestors."

 ancestor_worship.2.d:0 "It has been a very long time since we have had proper contact with the humans of Cannor. Now that the way to Escann is open once more, we have heard amazing tales of the wonders a dwarf there has wrought. Balgar, in service to the Empire of Castanor, designed several wondrous castles and an impressive wall that stretches all around the inner parts of Castanor. The dwarves of Cannor have accepted him as one of the Great Ancestors on their shrines."

It had ever been a distant thing, however, and we had not heard about the great tales that were forged in that conflict. Greatest among these by far are the tales of Murri Giantbreaker, who is said to have killed dozens of giants by his own blade. After his passing, he was given a place on the shrines as a new Great Ancestor."

 ancestor_worship.100.t:0 "A New Ancestor Revered"
 ancestor_worship.100.d:0 "Our previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was a great person in life, and with their passing the histories of their life are now being written. Some dwarves have already added them to their house shrines, but were they worthy enough in life to be added to the public shrines?"
 ancestor_worship.100.1:0 "They shall be added into the ancestral annals."
 ancestor_worship.100.2:0 "Good, but not good enough."

 ancestor_worship.101.t:0 "Unearthed Records"
 ancestor_worship.101.d:0 "Our ongoing efforts to deepen [Root.Province.GetName] have by chance dug up some old records from the days of Aul-Dwarov. Our Stone Keepers have been enthusiastically copying the decaying pages, and updating some of our own records."
 ancestor_worship.101.1:0 "Another piece of our history recovered!"
 ancestor_worship.101.2:0 "Time to set some records straight."

 ancestor_worship.102.t:0 "Conflicting Records"
 ancestor_worship.102.d:0 "It has recently been found that different historiographical records of a revered ancestor conflict with each other, leading to heated debate between different factions of the Stone Keepers. While it isn’t really our business to interfere, the debate is starting to interfere with their other duties."
 ancestor_worship.102.1:0 "We must make the decision for them."
 ancestor_worship.102.2:0 "Let them argue, they’ll tire themselves out."
 ancestor_worship.102.3:0 "Fascinating, and where did you say they diverge?"

 ancestor_worship.103.t:0 "Inspired Warriors"
 ancestor_worship.103.d:0 "There are plenty of stories of dwarves fighting on despite facing impossible odds and certain doom. They are solemn and beautiful, we honour those ancestors who fell in defence of their holds and clans. But Krummul’s story was different. Krummul shows us that sometimes, despite seemingly impossible odds, we can win. Krummul’s stories inspire hope."
 ancestor_worship.103.1:0 "We aspire to his strength."
 ancestor_worship.103.2:0 "We are honoured to have inherited his strength."

 ancestor_worship.104.t:0 "Inspired Building"
 ancestor_worship.104.d:0 "Every single hold is a marvel of engineering, a testament to dwarven ingenuity and craftsmanship. But most dwarves will grudgingly accept that some of the most impressive achievements of dwarven engineering lie outside of the mountains. Balgar’s wonders are an inspiration to many, and his styles are even emulated in the holds of the Dwarovar."
 ancestor_worship.104.1:0 "May our walls be as sturdy as his."
 ancestor_worship.104.2:0 "We who remain remember the Builder."

 ancestor_worship.105.t:0 "Inspired Farming"
 ancestor_worship.105.d:0 "Some foolish dwarves think Quila the Harvester is out of place amongst the Great Ancestors, deriding her as ‘just a farmer’. Any dwarf who knows their history, however, knows just how fundamentally her work changed the Dwarovar. After Quila’s irrigation works were implemented, the Serpent’s Vale went from being able to feed Amldihr to being able to feed every single hold with heaps to spare. Quila heralded in an age of plenty and prosperity for Aul-Dwarov that was never before seen."
 ancestor_worship.105.1:0 "Grow and prosper!"
 ancestor_worship.105.2:0 "By lift and lock, water to the shelves."

 ancestor_worship.106.t:0 "Inspired Spelunking"
 ancestor_worship.106.d:0 "When Urist the Spelunker was born, Grozumdihr and Ovdal Kanzad were the easternmost holds in the Dwarovar. It was Urist who discovered the entryway towards the eastern Tree of Stone region, and later in life he travelled over the surface to explore the caverns of the mountain range that would eventually become known as the Jade Mines. No less than five holds would eventually be built based on the detailed maps that Urist drew on his adventures, and his drive to explore has always inspired dwarvenkind since."
 ancestor_worship.106.1:0 "Delve further, find every secret."
 ancestor_worship.106.2:0 "Bring light where none has ever been."

 ancestor_worship.107.t:0 "Inspired Invention"
 ancestor_worship.107.d:0 "Of all the Great Ancestors, Mellegar the Inventor was without a doubt the most controversial during his own time, drawing criticism for his outlandish claims and strange designs even in his home hold of Orlghelovar. Over time, however, as science proved his claims one by one and his designs, while not always practical, worked flawlessly, he was instituted as a Great Ancestor long after his death. A good reminder that sometimes, established knowledge is simply wrong, and the madman breaking sacred convention is exactly what was needed."
 ancestor_worship.107.1:0 "Dwarven Innovation!"
 ancestor_worship.107.2:0 "Take dwarven science to new heights... err depths."

 ancestor_worship.108.t:0 "Inspired Drinking"
 ancestor_worship.108.d:0 "Hehogrim the Diligent is most famous for his inventions and hold designs, but his aptitude for feasting and drinking is not far behind. In life, he was a shining example of how a dwarf can drink and be merry and still achieve great things. Raise a tankard to Hehogrim!"
 ancestor_worship.108.1:0 "hshhooo whaddid I sayy ishnt thish a fiine brreww?"
 ancestor_worship.108.2:0 "aannyonneoyou whanaa go shwimm ijnna fhountjain?"

 ancestor_worship.109.t:0 "Inspired Legislation"
 ancestor_worship.109.d:0 "Gimron Lawgiver does not have any exciting stories written about him. Still, he is remembered with great reverence all the same. Gimron led the rewriting of the Foundational Laws of the Dwarovar in the wake of the War of the Bloody Gem, in an effort to mend the deep wounds that civil war had wrought. Every dwarf has duties and rights that no king or clanhead can take away from them in pursuit of pride or glory. Real justice is not just punishment. It is healing."
 ancestor_worship.109.1:0 "A solid precedent for our laws."
 ancestor_worship.109.2:0 "Words must sometimes bind hard as stone."

 ancestor_worship.110.t:0 "Inspired Slaying"
 ancestor_worship.110.d:0 "Dwarves are short of stature compared to most of the races of the world, but our size belies a strength and constitution few can match. Dwarves are respected members of adventuring parties and guilds across Halann, be it as warriors or rune-mages: every dwarf is more than their size. No dwarf has ever embodied this more than Murri Giantbreaker, and it is no wonder that his stories ever remain popular among our population."
 ancestor_worship.110.1:0 "To the next generation of giant-slayers."
 ancestor_worship.110.2:0 "By work like theirs the Dwarovar is a brighter place."

 ancestor_worship.111.t:0 "Inspired zeal"
 ancestor_worship.111.d:0 "Dagrin Everbeard is considered the greatest among the ancestors, his stories measuring in the dozens. He is considered the founding father of the dwarven race, and the dagrite that connects all of the Dwarovar through the rails is named in his honour. It is he who made us a people of stories."
 ancestor_worship.111.1:0 "And his stories we shall tell!"
 ancestor_worship.111.2:0 "As our rails, like roots the stories spread!"

 ancestor_worship.112.t:0 "Other Stories"
 ancestor_worship.112.d:0 "Storytellers have always been the primary way that young dwarves are introduced to our history, and gain respect for their ancestors. Recently, however, more and more storytellers are also including stories from outside the Dwarovar, telling about the heroics of humans, elves, and more. Our Stone Keepers are less than pleased about this, and are requesting that we pay the storytellers of the realm to focus on our own history."
 ancestor_worship.112.1:0 "Storytellers have always been free to choose their stories."
 ancestor_worship.112.2:0 "Our people must not be deprived of their history."

 ancestor_worship.113.t:0 "Old Mausoleum"
 ancestor_worship.113.d:0 "Clearing out an old collapsed tunnel has revealed the lost mausoleum of a locally revered ancestor, which has reinvigorated interest in stories about them. The Stone Keepers have jumped at the chance to capitalise on this, funding the restoration of the mausoleum out of pocket."
 ancestor_worship.113.1:0 "Marvellous!"

 ancestor_worship.114.t:0 "Ruler's ancestor celebrated"
 ancestor_worship.114.d:0 "Each clan has their own venerated ancestors with their own holiday. One of these holidays is today, and it happens to be the holiday of an ancestor of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. While the celebrations were planned to be private, the Stone Keepers suggest we use some of our funds for a large celebration that all of our subjects might participate in."
 ancestor_worship.114.1:0 "A good excuse for a good feast!"
 ancestor_worship.114.2:0 "I’m sure they don’t really care about this obscure ancestor of ours."

 ancestor_worship.115.t:0 "Clan head builds shrine"
 ancestor_worship.115.d:0 "An influential clan head is funding a public shrine dedicated to himself. This has proven quite controversial amongst our Stone Keepers, partially because he has not starred in any stories of note, but mostly because he is not even dead yet. They are petitioning us to put a stop to the construction."
 ancestor_worship.115.1:0 "I suppose we can be motivated to ignore this"
 ancestor_worship.115.2:0 "Cease your sacrilege or I'll make an ancestor of you now!"

 ancestor_worship.116.t:0 "A Worthy Outsider"
 ancestor_worship.116.d:0 "Tales of a great person from [noble_ancestor_border_prov.GetName] have spread amongst our people, as they have lived alongside us and achieved great deeds. Since their passing, some dwarves have even added them to their home shrines. This has led to some dispute amongst our Stone Keepers. Almost every shrine also honours dwarves who are not actually ancestors, so a lack of direct lineage should not be prohibitive for veneration. But should the veneration of a non-dwarf be incorporated into the scriptures?"
 ancestor_worship.116.1:0 "They were no dwarf, but they were noble as one."
 ancestor_worship.116.2:0 "Only dwarves may be venerated."
 ancestor_worship.116.3:0 "To be dwarven is not beard or blood, it is a way of life."

 ancestor_worship.117.t:0 "All Ancestors' Day"
 ancestor_worship.117.d:0 "All Ancestors’ Day happens every year, but some years there are more funds for a greater celebration, or simply more need to remember the recently passed. All dwarves who are able to come together with their clans or families to pay respects to the ancestors, whether they died long ago or recently. This is done by lighting candles at the shrines and tombs, and exchanging stories about the ancestors. All Ancestors’ Day is a day of mourning and ritual storytelling, but also a day to meet old friends, mend rivalries, and assure every dwarf that they, too, will be remembered."
 ancestor_worship.117.1:0 "And for once nobody will end the night in the gutter."

 ancestor_worship.118.t:0 "Ancestor's tomb destroyed"
 ancestor_worship.118.d:0 "Tombs are more often than not built outside of holds, in order to save space for the living. This does have the drawback that it is not easy to keep them all safe. The Dwarovar has never been safe outside of the gates of a hold, and recently, some rampaging monsters have gravely defaced the grave of our ancestors. Whether it was ettins, minotaurs or some other large creature, the result is the same, and a lot of carefully crafted dwarven stonework lies in ruin."
 ancestor_worship.118.1:0 "Accursed beasts!"
 ancestor_worship.118.2:0 "We’ll rebuild it then."
 ancestor_worship.118.3:0 "A good opportunity to make it far grander."

 HOLY_SITE_4119_DESC:0 "Amldihr, meaning Gates of the Assembly, was where the united empire of Aul-Dwarov was founded. It was where the Dwarovkron was forged to unify all dwarfkind, and its district of Amlharaz was where the High Assembly of Holds met to advise its bearer. It also laid at the centre of the great surface terrace farms of the Serpent's Vale, giving the High King the ability to feed all his subjects food to sustain themselves in the dark depths of the mountain."
 HOLY_SITE_4311_DESC:0 "Grônstunad was a much younger hold than many of the prestigious holds of the west, but it would eclipse many in wealth and prestige. Far removed as it was from the imperial centre of Aul-Dwarov, it was relatively untouched in the War of the Bloody Gem. When Amldihr and much of the west fell to the orcish invasion, Grônstunad was poised to become the new dwarven capital. To this end, the Jade Empire was founded, aimed at safeguarding the eastern realms of Aul-Dwarov and eventually reclaiming the west. It would not last. Yet more infighting amongst the remaining holds opened the door for a devastating hobgoblin invasion, and all of the Jade Mines would soon come under the control of the hobgoblin Command."
 HOLY_SITE_2931_DESC:0 "Er-Natvir was not only one of the core holds of the Dwarovar, but also the hub in which all rails sprouted from. All goods passing through to and from the capital passed through this hold, and the trade archives - a testament of Dwarven organisation - held information about goods passing through the hold from before even the rails were laid. Er-Natvir’s fall early into the orcish invasion would prove a catalyst for the collapse of the rest of Aul-Dwarov, as the rails going without upkeep severely hampered movement between holds."
 HOLY_SITE_4078_DESC:0 "Named after the dwarf Hehogrim the Diligent who designed it, Hehodovar is known as the first hold. Although dwarfkind was created in the Tree of Stone, Hehodovar is where dwarven civilization truly begun. Based squarely in the middle of the Dwarovar, it would serve as an early de facto capital of dwarfkind, from where efforts were made to build other holds in the Middle Dwarovar and beyond. Its role as a cultural centre would diminish over time, and by the time of the unification of Aul-Dwarov it had become a place of the practical arts of crafting and building."
 HOLY_SITE_2963_DESC:0 "Hul-Jorkad was a hold of no great importance... until one day a dark scourge emerged from its depths. These beasts were named after the hold itself, but to the greater world, they were known by a simpler name: Orcs. Deadlier than the goblins that had infested the mountains, the orcish threat brought doom to upon dwarves. Dwarfkind lost their dominion over the mountains, and hold after hold would perish under the orcish menace."
 HOLY_SITE_4093_DESC:0 "Arg-Ôrdstun was ever one of the wealthiest, most prestigious, and most powerful holds of the Serpentspine, and while its monarch officially did not have a higher rank than any other, Arg-Ôrdstun effectively ruled all of the Serpentreach in all but name. The source of this wealth and power were the most productive diamond mines in all of the Serpentspine, which were instrumental in both ornamentation and toolmaking. In the War of the Bloody Gem, Arg-Ôrdstun would lead the rebellious holds against the High King of Aul-Dwarov, in order to maintain its prestige over the perceived slight of the Ruby gem being added to the Dwarovkron."
 HOLY_SITE_4269_DESC:0 "Worship of the old Dwarven Pantheon was largely abandoned with the fall of Aul-Dwarov, but reverence for Halanna still remained among many dwarves. Halanna is said to have created the first dwarves in Earthseed, and perfected Halann for the noble races of the world to live upon and in. It is said that Halanna eventually retreated into the Plane of Earth from the very same place where she created dwarfkind, and Earthseed’s caverns are still among the most beautiful in the entire Serpentspine because of this."
