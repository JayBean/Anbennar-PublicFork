 flavor_lodhum.1.t:0 "The Reign of Gerin Orcrend"
 flavor_lodhum.1.d:0 "Once, Gerin Orcrend was a Castellyrian adventurer. Once, he awoke to hundreds of Orcs dead at his hand, and a dead friend beside him. Once, he decided to single-handedly purge the Dwarovar of orcs. Once, he saw the Greentide march, and he slew what he could but trusted in the White Walls of Castellyr to hold off the rest. (Once, he was wrong). Once, he saw the potential of the Dwarovar unfurl before him, a whisper of the greatness that was and that could be again.\n\nOnce, he met a dwarf named Dwalra. Once, he failed to hold off the Orcish assault that saw her husband killed, her son Balgar made fatherless. Once, Dwalra fell in love with him. Once, married, they returned to the Hold of her birth. And once, Gerin's possession of the sapphire gem of the Dwarovkron and the sword that had won him the name Orcrend saw him elected as King, to lead the Hold's rebirth.\n\nBut that was long ago. Now, he walks with the support of a cane, and leaves his sword at home. Now, the scars blur together, as the details of their woundings fade from view. Now, he rests easy, sleeps at night without fear of being set upon by Orcs, surrounded by walls he has inspected and guards he has trained. And now he can sit, and watch his son learn to lead.\n\nAnd soon he shall sleep, knowing Ovdal Lodhum shall lead the Dwarovar's reclamation. But as long as dwarves inhabit the Dwarovar, there shall be legends of the one they call Trickster, the one they call Orcrend, the faceless figure who had slain hundreds of thousands of orcs, a number matched by none before or since."
 flavor_lodhum.1.a:0 "Long may he reign!"

 flavor_lodhum.3.t:0 "The Third and Last Death of Gerin Orcrend"
 flavor_lodhum.3.d:0 "Gerin Orcrend knew many deaths.\n\nThere was the death of a Castellyrian adventurer, a man who saw the open sky and beaming sun, who left them both behind for the Serpentspine's depths. There was the death of a trickster, the death of a nightmare, when he put down his sword and took up a wife and a son and a cane.\n\nNow, he has faced another death. More pleasant than the rest - surrounded by loved ones, a funeral attended by all the dwarves of Ovdal Lodhum - and also more final."
 flavor_lodhum.3.a:0 "Ovdal Lodhum mourns a man, and a legend."

 flavor_lodhum.4.t:0 "In Mourning"
 flavor_lodhum.4.d:0 "Ovdal Lodhum has spent millennia thinking on the order of centuries. That is the natural timescale for mountains, and for dwarves. And within it, Gerin Orcrend is - was - a spark amidst a vast cavern of darkness, or perhaps a flash of lightning.\n\nBalgar knew this day would come. He knew it the first time he called his father 'father'. But nonetheless, it's not a moment he, or any dwarf, is well-trained for. How do you return to a life of centuries, when your existence has been forever reshaped in a span of decades?"
 flavor_lodhum.4.a:0 "One day at a time?"

 flavor_lodhum.5.t:0 "A Woman Weeps, and Acts"
 flavor_lodhum.5.d:0 "Dwalra spent a time mourning beside the tomb of the man she loved. A week in total, sitting in silence, eating only the water and plain bread a few close friends brought her. A week of reflection and reassessment and grief.\n\nAnd then she left, having completed only a twentieth of the standard mourning period, a fiftieth of the time customary for a hero or other great figure. Dwarven eyes watched her as she proceeded back to her home, brows furrowed, a glare or two levelled. But, like Orcrend through orcflesh, she did not stop.\n\nAt the doorway to the house she had lived in for decades, which no longer quite felt like a home, she stopped. Turned. Gave the crowd that had trailed her a withering look, let out a soft sigh. Squeezed her nails into her palm, wishing there was a calloused hand she could squeeze instead.\n\nBut instead she went inside, down the steps. "None of them knew him, not all of him. None of them know how to honour him. That's something only I know."\n\nThen she looked up, saw her son standing in his childhood bedroom, tears still dripping down his face. "Something only we know.""
 flavor_lodhum.5.a:0 "But maybe they will learn it, in time."

 flavor_lodhum.6.t:0 "Like Father, Like Son"
 flavor_lodhum.6.d:0 "The sword knows what it is doing. Balgar does not.\n\nIt knows every move a dwarf or Castellyrian would be trained in, and a thousand learned the hard way. It knows every slice, every block, every parry. Balgar was taught these, yes, practiced them under his father's eye, but it doesn't seem to work the same when that gentle, gruff, voice isn't there to shout "Keep up that guard!" or "Faster!" or "That's my boy!".\n\nThe sword fits awkwardly in a hand not calloused over decades, a bit long for a man who reaches only four feet. But as he lifts it above his head in Ovdal Lodhum's main hall, neither his arm nor his resolve wavers.\n\nHe speaks, and by a magic Dwalra learned and forgot a century ago, then learned again yesterday, his voice fills the space. "My father is dead. Gerin is dead. But Orcrend is not. And neither are we!""
 flavor_lodhum.6.a:0 "Under Orcrend, we fight!"
 flavor_lodhum.6.tooltip:0 "We will gain the §YOrcrend§! modifier whenever we are at war with §Yorcs§!"

 flavor_lodhum.7.t:0 "Rend the Orcs"
 flavor_lodhum.7.d:0 "The sword knows what it's doing. Balgar, still, does not quite feel comfortable with it in his hand. But a blade that has slain a hundred thousand orcs can add more to that total even in an uncertain hand.\n\nThat, of course, is what Balgar is trying to convince himself of as he takes his first steps outside Ovdal Lodhum's walls since the fateful expedition which saw his father slain and a human encountered. The rest of that story was history... but today Ovdal Lodhum's future is written."
 flavor_lodhum.7.a:0 "With a pen of steel, and orcish blood as ink."
 flavor_lodhum.7.tooltip:0 "Unlock the §YSlaughter the Orcs§! decision"

 flavor_lodhum.8.t:0 "A Monument to a Man, and More"
 flavor_lodhum.8.d:0 "To the orcs, Orcrend was known as Trickster, a shadow in the night whose traps and ambushes were as important to his deadliness as his proficiency with the sword. Many saw him as a shadow, a nightmare, the Serpentspine's deadly darkness embodied.\n\nThe orcs might be surprised to see the monument we have built to Gerin in Orcsfall - though the only orcs to be found anywhere in the vicinity are corpses. The statue is carved of bright marble, carved and polished to the point it sparkles in the torchlight. Gerin's gaze looks towards the distance, just as the man himself always looked beyond.\n\nHe gestures Orcrend almost absent-mindedly, it was always an extension of his body after all, and accurately conveying that took the sculptor team as long as the rest of the work combined. We did take one liberty, only one - the pommel is adorned in garnets. He was ours at the end, after all, and we are his."
 flavor_lodhum.8.a:0 "Now, and forever more"

 flavor_lodhum.9.t:0 "Onwards with Orcrend"
 flavor_lodhum.9.d:0 "Step. Lunge. Block. Step. Cut. Half-twirl. Slash.\n\nBalgar is still using the motions he learned from his father, though he has picked up some of the improvisation necessary when a black orc's tusks aim to gouge out your throat. Battle, ambush, slaughter; the days and weeks and months have already begun to blur together, and Balgar has lost count of the number of deaths added to Orcrend's toll. He can't help but shudder when he thinks that this was his father's life, the sum total of it, for decades."
 flavor_lodhum.9.a:0 "This… this is life?"



 flavor_lodhum.30.t:0 "Orcrend Rests"
 flavor_lodhum.30.d:0 "What is a sword? The will and testament of a man you called father? A tool, to make a better world? A relic, long since rendered obsolete?\n\nThese questions could be asked of any weapon, but today, Balgar Gerinsson asks them of Orcrend. Most of Ovdal Lodhum know the weapon as their symbol, as his symbol, the symbol of the war that the Garnet Dwarves chose when they opened their gates and went out into the dark. But that is not all of it. It just isn't. Because Balgar also remembers his father, remembers Gerin leaning on the scabbard as if it was his cane. Remembers him using it to cut fungus as well as cut orcflesh. Maybe Orcrend can't be more, but Gerin? Gerin was. And the Garnet Dwarves can be too.\n\nOrcrend has written its chapter, in blood and bone and corpses. And in lives saved, tragedies averted, slaughter stopped in its tracks. Gerin fought for decades before his rest; his blade took a little longer. But now, Gerin's son knows, hopes, dreams, Ovdal Lodhum can turn to the next chapter, honouring Gerin but leaving one piece of his legacy behind, seeking more civilized weapons for a more civilized age."
 flavor_lodhum.30.d2:0 "What is a sword? An edge, gleaming in the dark? A tool, to make a better world? A relic, long since rendered obsolete?\n\nThese questions could be asked of any weapon, but today, [Root.Monarch.GetName] asks them of Orcrend. It is a sword that has known the sheath of scabbard, but never the sheath of peace. It is a sword that has grown dull from use, but never grown dull from disuse. Or perhaps it did, for a span of decades, barely a drop in an aquifer, before that dream faded and Ovdal Lodhum pursued another.\n\nOrcrend has written its chapter, in blood and bone and corpses. And in lives saved, tragedies averted, slaughter stopped in its tracks. Gerin fought for decades before his rest; his blade took a little longer. But now, [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows, hopes, dreams, Ovdal Lodhum can turn to the next chapter, with more civilized weapons for a more civilized age."
 flavor_lodhum.30.a:0 "Thank you, Orcrend, for your service."

 flavor_lodhum.10.d:0 "Our patrols just beyond the labyrinths of Verkal Skomdihr do not tend to be all that eventful, save the encounter with the occasional goblin or orc raider. This time, however, they came across a badly wounded elf, leaning against a tree, who was passing in and out of consciousness.\n\nAfter he was brought into the hold to recover, we tried to find out what happened to him. We could not understand him, but after he was handed a piece of chalk he drew a figure that every dwarf in the room recognized. Angry grumbling and cursing filled the room, and the elf recoiled in fear before he realized that not he, but the orc he had drawn, was the target of our rage.\n\nWhen the dwarves had calmed down after every last one of them had personally sworn vengeance, the elf managed to explain through gestures and further drawings that his clan still survived, but was hard-pressed by the wars with the orcs and goblins."

 flavor_lodhum.11.t:0 "A Land in Turmoil"
 flavor_lodhum.11.d:0 "We have just begun to receive comprehensive reports from our scouts out of the Serpentreach to re-establish contact with the lands to our south. In doing so, we have encountered someone in the territory outside of Glogund Cave, an injured human from the lands of Bulwar, a realm of hills, rivers, and sand baked by the heat of the sun. This is not the first time in our memory that we have found a human seeking sanctuary and respite.\n\nWe have learned he is a Gelkali, from the lands often known as Gelkalis - and of that realm's plight. His homeland struggles - or suffers? The grasp we hold of his language is poor, so it is difficult to make out one from the other, but we have learned goblins came in hordes into his people's lands - a tide of goblins spawned by Dookanson's war to unite the orc clans no doubt, and that elves of another kind have essentially made humanity second-class citizens in their own realms.  A species of winged women-birds our records indicate to be called harpies have also harassed this land for centuries, abducting males of many species in order to mate and propagate their own kind. Bulwar is a land torn by struggle and strife, and...."
 flavor_lodhum.11.a:0 "...it seems orcs aren't the only evil out there"

 flavor_lodhum.12.t:0 "Another Grudge"
 flavor_lodhum.12.d:0 "Love can come in many forms, many pleasant, some dark and others twisted. In this case, it is not even one of those forms. Our delegation to Arg-Ôrdstun has returned, battered and evidently unwelcome. They were met at the gates and their case heard, but what came next was unexpected and unacceptable.\n\nThey called us love-blind fools, insinuating relations with orcs and goblins to pass the days in our hold, and say that if we truly love dwarfkind, we will kneel to Arg-Ôrdstun and perhaps after we have proven our worth, we could be treated as if we were a favoured pet or tool. They even threw rock dust to hasten their departure.\n\nThis insult to us cannot go unanswered. The leadership of Arg-Ôrdstun must pay."
 flavor_lodhum.12.a:0 "We offer love and friendship and they mock us?"

 flavor_lodhum.13.t:0 "In the Halls of the Mountain King"
 flavor_lodhum.13.d:0 "A dwarven hold is nothing less than an architectural marvel. An example would be the Warding Gate of Verkal Skomdihr. While the wards themselves broke during the Day of Ashen Skies, the physical structure itself is an example of lasting dwarven engineering.\n\nBut to the average Dwarf, these miracles are commonplace. As they live in these holds for their whole lives, their grand and ancient halls are all that they know. So when the first visitors started arriving, we were unprepared for the feelings of wonder and awe.\n\nThus we are reminded of why we carry on the legacy of our ancestors and why we remember their names. It is because they built the world in which we stand. It is through the eyes of our foreign friends and allies that we see our home for what it truly is, and take pride once more in our heritage."

 flavor_lodhum.18.t:0 "The Hold where Love Lives"
 flavor_lodhum.18.d:0 "Around a table, four women sit with cups of tea, the leaves brought from Moonhaven, with a book in front of each of them. In the next room, their partners chat about the long work day yesterday, about how they are glad to be here. It's a special day, after all. Today is the day the King renews his vows with his royal consort, and the entire realm is in celebration.\n\nOloris looks to his friends, and pours a glass of Lodhum Red, grown in the very caves nearby the hold. He raises a toast, having to keep his glass low so the gnome and the halfling at the table can clink their glasses. “To the health of the King, and his beloved!” they cry, as they all take a drink. The carousing and merriment carries on into the night, until eventually it is time to go home. The couples eventually come together and begin to say their goodbyes. The Gnomish artificer and his wife say goodbye in their familiar, if foreign, Giberdi accent. Next comes the Imperial Halfling and his fiance, a Redfoot, as he had learned. They came to say their vows, but stayed - much like himself, when he met his beloved. The last to leave is his human friend and their dwarven wife. Many had commented he had 'pulled a Gerin', always in jest of course. The two were happy together, and in love. Who was he to judge?\n\nEventually, it was simply himself, and his wife. She still, of course, looked as beautiful as the day they had met, half a decade ago now. Her eyes shone the same colour as the garnet gemstone that hung around her neck, the love stone he had given her. If his father had learned he had married a harpy, he would have likely died in an apopleptic fit. But that is why he came here, to find a spouse that he would truly love, not some arranged political farce made by two families.\n\n“They'll be lighting the celebration lanterns now,” she said, as she curled herself into his embrace, and pulled him onto the sofa. “The whole hold will be glowing pink soon. Maybe we ought to take an evening walk.” she kicked off her shoes, and nestled in on top of him, making no effort to act on her proposal. “Let's just stay in,” said Oloris, knowing perfectly well what she actually wanted. His wife smiled, and closed her eyes. “Good answer,” she said. “Good answer.” "

A harpy belonging to an influential clan related to the rulers of Harpylen has recently been harassing a prominent dwarven individual, attempting to bribe and now outright kidnap the individual in question. The harpy's position in her home society means that outright throwing her out might make some problems, but a discreet solution will likely be a headache on our end."
 flavor_lodhum.108.a:0 "This requires a delicate touch…"

 flavor_lodhum.109.d:0 "It is a lesser known fact that harpies, much like birds, moult.

We can set aside funds and hire people to clean it up now, but it's also likely that eventually the citizenry will make their own attempts, although it will likely be a long time on the scale of a hold before it happens at that rate."
 flavor_lodhum.109.a:0 "Hire some dedicated cleaners."

 flavor_lodhum.110.d:0 "Harpies have many ways to get what they want, and in this case it's without a fight. A harpy matriarch has brought her flock of daughters into [Root.lodhum_target.GetName], establishing a temporary nest and brothel, which has become quite popular both between the locals and visitors to the area.\n\nWhile this is generally not of our notice, the matriarch herself has offered to have her and her daughters stay for a longer span of time, retaining their 'services' in the region for longer than intended if the right arrangement can be struck."

 flavor_lodhum.111.d:0 "Grudges are everywhere in dwarven society, but we have our ways of working around them. The average dwarf knows it is far healthier to let grudges fester and worsen over time than to actually act on them, or we would be at each other's throats at all times. So long as we meticulously avoid one another, we can hate each other from a distance, and keep the peace.\n\nHowever, when surface dwarves with a grudge meet each other abroad, though, they don't tend to have the restraint to stop themselves from starting a fight. Such a fight between surface dwarves seems to have broken out today."

Now, however, it has gotten truly out of hand, as the partygoers are spilling out into the neighbourhood, and causing severe damages."

The reason behind their arrival quickly becomes apparent when a bundle begins to cry, the child's human mother trying to quiet the child.\n\nAfter our declaration of equality between man and elf, it seems a number of younger Sun Elves took to it wholeheartedly, if in secret. These individuals have made the long trek, abandoned by their families, and now seek refuge here. The matter of helping them is obvious, to what extent is the question."

This has been achieved by a number of rather cutthroat practises, such as buying out failing competitors, artificially restricting the markets by buying product before it can arrive in our borders, and there are even accusations of direct sabotage of their competitors.\n\nThe individual in question, however, has presented an exquisite collection of scents and smells collected from Aelantir to Rahen and all the lands in between as a gift to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the court at a recent royal function.

 flavor_lodhum.119.d:0 "Halflings are known to excel at enjoying themselves, particularly when it comes to good food. Because of this, the halfling quarter has become a popular location for any denizens of the hold looking to dine outside of their own home.\n\nToday, however, everyone in the hold, rich or poor, can get a taste of good halfling cooking, as several of the largest families of the quarter are cooperating to organize a grand feast, with no invitations required. As the families engage in friendly competition with one another, each part of the banquet is more rich and elaborate than the last, resulting in a feast that won't soon be forgotten."

 lodhum_respite_desc:0 "The elves of the Deepwood have become very adept at living alongside the fey. However, this is an arduous existence, and some elves have started to seek out the quiet and the solitude of the caverns around Verkal Skomdihr to rest and meditate before returning to the woods. Some have even chosen to stay there, setting up small sanctuaries for those seeking a respite from the fey."

 lodhum_wooden_horsies_desc:0 "The abundance of high-quality wood that we now have access to from Cyranvar has inspired a lot of new uses by enterprising artisans in Verkal Skomdihr.

But more than that, many a dwarven soldier now has an elven brother in arms, whom they have fought alongside for many battles."

 lodhum_mountain_love_desc:0 "The Serpentreach has seen many centuries of conflict and turmoil, but those have come to an end. Through our efforts, we have reclaimed it and made it safe again and free of any orcish taint. But we could not have made such strides alone.\n\nWith help from the Gelkali and harpies of Bulwar, and the Wood Elves of Cyranvar to protect us from the dangers of the surface, we have acted in turn to defend them from the dangers of the Dwarovar that spilled forth as consequences of the Greentide as well as from each other.\n\nIt is only right, then, that they too are able to experience the wonders of the Dwarovar like we do. Let us throw wide our gates to our surface-dwelling allies and show them what love has wrought."

Composting orc corpses can only do so much, and after a time you run out of orc corpses.\n\nA more long term solution can be found in Bulwar. The land is rich, its farmland fed by rivers which collect the silt of a dozen lands. Let us make an offer to various individuals throughout Bulwar - dwarven yellow gold for their Bulwari rich and loamy gold.\n\nIt will take some time for the caverns we have chosen for this project to be completely overhauled as we supplant the existing industries, but it will be well worth it."
 lodhum_vineyards_title:0 "Vineyards in the Caves"
 lodhum_vineyards_desc:0 "Wine, regardless of its origins and those who drink it, has been a symbol of love and romance. Thus, it is only fitting that we turn these new cave-farms of ours into places where a unique vintage unlike any other in the world can be grown. However, we are not farmers by trade or heritage, so it will take time for our workers in these vineyards to really begin accumulating the experience necessary. Regardless, however, this labour of love will be seen through so the lovers of our hold may drink a wine that is truly made from love."

However, the harpies we have encountered through Gelkalis seem to be more intelligent, and more amicable to words than an orc or a goblin. We should strive towards an understanding with these harpies more, and protect them from extinction.\n\nThey are, ultimately, only driven to their actions by the need to find a partner and that is something any dwarf of Ovdal Lodhum can understand."
 lodhum_monsters_title:0 "Monsters no More"
 lodhum_monsters_desc:0 "The harpies of Harpylen have begun to take towards our guidance, but it will take a dedicated core of individuals beyond the occasional diplomatic mission or trade caravan.\n\nWe need to gather a group of skilled advisors in our employ, and send them to Harpylen to aid them in matters of state and moving forward as a society.

Harpylen is now a proper state, standing tall as members of modern society, but there are those who still cling to old views.\n\nThe harpies therefore need a protector on the surface, for we in our mountains cannot be there to deter the nations of Bulwar from attacking out of misguided and old hatreds. We shall therefore contact Gelkalis and Harpylen, negotiating an arrangement for their mutual benefit."
 lodhum_todays_friend_title:0 "Is Today's Friend"
 lodhum_todays_friend_desc:0 "We have forged a diplomatic arrangement like none other. Human, dwarf, and harpy work together in mutual love and unity towards a brighter future for all.\n\nAs the face of warfare changes with the proliferation of firearms, we will need to constantly be adapting with our allies, and must make use of all of our races' unique skills. Taking this opportunity to work together, we shall practice strategies and exchange ideas to ensure that we remain up to date on all sorts of military tactics for when our armies need to leave our mountain homes."

 lodhum_proper_entrance_desc:0 "Glogund Cave is, unfortunately, exactly that - a cave. One that happens to connect to the surface, but a cave nonetheless.\n\nTo facilitate proper, high volume trade and entry into the Serpentspine from Bulwar, we will need to secure the hold of Shazstundihr, which was once famed for its marble and will be once again. Repairs to the old markets in the hold will be necessary however, and since it opens up to outside the Serpentreach, we will have to ensure there is adequate defences in order to protect from threats beyond our halls."
 lodhum_proper_path_title:0 "A Proper Path"
 lodhum_proper_path_desc:0 "The way from Ovdal Tûngr to Shazstundihr is a beautiful sight to behold, of towering peaks, breathtaking clifftop views, and stunning sights from the shore of the Divenhal Sea. It is a shame, then, that most travellers must make their way along winding paths, through deep ravines, or otherwise risk the chance of being ambushed by less savory individuals.\n\nLet us fund the construction of a great dwarven built road, something to bring those who wish to see the beauty of the Dwarovar with their own two eyes to us in safety and comfort."

Whatever the reality is, they make very good cannons and they are very close to us, unlike the Lords of Amber.\n\nLet us outsource some of our cannon production and acquire us some of the Copper Dwarves' finest guns. We get cannons, the Copper Dwarves get gold, and our enemies will get dwarven-delivered death in a hail of cannonfire."
 lodhum_tourism_benefits_title:0 "Tourism Has Its Benefits"
 lodhum_tourism_benefits_desc:0 "Opening the Serpentreach has been seen by many of our elders as the boldest move in dwarven history, allowing the surface dwellers entry to our hallowed halls. All while, of course, wearing tunics made from Gelkali fabrics and woollens, enjoying bread baked from grain bought from Bulwar and other goods imported from Cannor.\n\nOpening our hold and home up has turned Shazstundihr into a cosmopolitan hold unlike any other seen before. Elf, dwarf, harpy and human live side by side in a society unlike any before. Ideas flow as freely as the wine and ale in the taverns which discuss them, from Ravelian science to Corinite and Sun Cult philosophies. We shall make the most and best of this, and as more travellers arrive from afar, it is no doubt only going to improve."

But no matter, they are dwarves and still our kin, their ancestors coming from the fall of the various holds that didn't weather the fall of the Dwarovar.\n\nWe should reach out to our brothers upon the surface, and aid them in any way we can; how can one truly love another if they cannot love and aid their kin, no matter how distant? Not to mention, in their gratitude we are certain they will let us make use of their port to receive shipments and guests from far away realms."

The only issue with this is the matter that between Ovdal Tûngr and Shazstundihr is a mess of coastal cliffs and rocky hills and mountains, plagued by the chaos of other powers.\n\nTherefore we should secure these territories on behalf of Ovdal Tûngr and therefore ensure that all guests arriving through Shazstundihr are safe."
 lodhum_safe_harbor_title:0 "A Safe Harbor"
 lodhum_safe_harbor_desc:0 "Ovdal Tûngr is a naval hold, unique in its design and construction, meaning it has to overcome some unique and specific problems on top of the ones traditionally associated with holds - primarily pirates.\n\nLet us send our friends some help in both expanding the hold's port facilities to defend against pirate attacks and renovating existing infrastructure. In addition, some materials to help put a few new ships to sea as well couldn't hurt."

The hold's rulership is complaining that our far-away guests are beginning to interfere with the hold's own traffic It is clear that something must be done; we must expand the port facilities even further, a whole new district of the port carved out of the rock, dedicated utterly to ships with guests or goods bound for Ovdal Lodhum.\n\nThis new district will become a melting pot of individuals and couples from far off lands, and no doubt allow Ovdal Tûngr to reclaim a number of docks and ship berths that we had built on our behalf."
 lodhum_controlling_trade_title:0 "Controlling our Trade"
 lodhum_controlling_trade_desc:0 "It is said more wealth leaves the Serpentreach than remains, and in a manner of speaking that is true. The bounty of the Serpentreach is exported not only by our own merchants, but foreigners using the opportunities of us opening the Serpentreach to enrich themselves, buying low cost gemstones and metals and then selling them for triple or even quadruple the prices just outside our gates in Bulwar and Cannor, all while profiting off our craftsdwarfship of the highest quality.\n\nEnough is enough. We will work out an arrangement with our friends in Ovdal Tûngr to prevent foreign, non-dwarven merchants who have registered in their borders from making off with the bounty of our home."

The printing press allows us to produce pamphlets and books in massive quantities, but our methods of distributing them are limited. In order to widen our reach, we need to tap into the trade routes to the Divenhal.\n\nThe Copper Dwarves are in a unique position, being situated on trade routes that reach out like a net across the Divenhal and Dameshead. We can make ready use of this by simply distributing the literature in Ovdal Tûngr and let visiting merchants take care of the rest.\n\nOne of the latest books printed, '50 Hues of Garnet', is already quite popular despite some of the risqué material within - no doubt the surface world will take to it just as readily as we have."

It would also be perfect for the chill that the caverns outside our holds can bring.\n\nGoats and sheep are tough animals, and with some clever engineering we could perhaps bring some underground.

Some now wish to, however, call our mountain halls their home as well, moving wholesale into Ovdal Lodhum.
