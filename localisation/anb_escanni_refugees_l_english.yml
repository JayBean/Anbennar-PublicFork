 #The final flight of the Escanni
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.t:0 "The Final Flight of the Escanni"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.d:0 "Twenty years ago, one of the great catastrophes of History befell Escann, a seemingly endless tide of green pouring out of the Serpentspine to lay waste to the kingdoms on the surface. One by one the kingdoms of Escann fell, and in the confusion and chaos countless denizens lost their lives. Many fled west to seek a safe haven, scattering across the continent towards havens from Bayvic to Nathalaire, but only the lucky few made it.\nFor twenty years, wave after wave of refugees have arrived at the edge of our realms, one torn family at a time.\nBut today, at last, the final group of refugees has reached us. Today the flight of the Escanni comes to an end.\n\nNow is the time to look onwards and build a future alongside our newfound denizens. The path may be rocky, as we have witnessed already in the past, but the only way now is forward."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.d2:0 "During the Greentide many denizens of Escann fled westwards. Through the combined efforts of Gawed, Arbaran and Damescrown, these refugees were welcomed across western Cannor and distributed around the Dameshead. This refugee crisis brought with it a wave of new ideas, as among those that fled Escann were nobles, scholars and knights. But it also strained nations that were busy fighting in the fourth Lilac War, leading to some nations refusing refugees.\nOur realm wasn’t able or willing to partake in the effort to help the refugees until recently; some refugees now seek shelter in our lands, and it is up to us to accommodate them until they settle down or hopefully reclaim Escann."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.a:0 "Only time will tell whether this is a boon or not."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.b:0 "We'll try to help them settle in."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.c:0 "Great, more dependents, they will have to take care of themselves."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.e:0 "Let's help them go back to Escann swiftly."
 escanni_refugees_settlement_100_tt:0 "Moving forwards we will have to deal with the refugees in our lands.\n"
 
 #Escann Stands
 escanni_refugees_settlement.101.t:0 "Escann Stands"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.101.d:0 "“Escann Stands”\nThose words are on the lips of town criers and merchants alike, to the exclusion of all else. Even from the window of the meeting room in [This.Capital.GetCapitalName], many common folk and refugees can be seen gathering around one such crier and listening to their tales, enraptured.\nInside the meeting room a different scene plays out, but the matter at hand is the same. An emissary from the [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName] stands opposite of [This.Monarch.GetTitle] [This.Monarch.GetName]. His charge is simple; he carries with him the following message:\n“Escann Stands, the Greentide is at an end and all those that wish to go to the [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName] are welcome to do so!”."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.101.a:0 "The age of the Greentide might be near its end."
 
 #The call of Home
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.t:0 "The Call of Home"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.d:0 "“Home”. To the Escanni refugees this word has a different connotation than for our people. To them “Home” is something lost, something that was destroyed and taken away from them. So when the Escanni say that “they are going home”, they do not say it lightly.\nThe reclamation of Escann has now begun in earnest, fledgling states establishing themselves in the smouldering ruins of Escann. Even though most are former adventurer bands that took the opportunity of claiming the riches of an abandoned land, they now seek to call home the former inhabitants of Escann.\nMost of these new nations have now dispatched messengers across western Cannor, spreading the word that the Escanni now have a homeland to come back to. And many refugees are heeding this call, leaving one group at a time towards the East.\n\nWe cannot stop them by force, but we can choose to help their venture; after all, Escann is still a dangerous place. What say you my [This.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.a:0 "They can call this land “Home” too if they want."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.b:0 "Good riddance."
 escanni_refugees_settlement_102_b_tt:0 "They do not reach Escann."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.c:0 "We will provide an escort, to protect their convoy."
 escanni_refugees_settlement_102_c_tt:0 "They reach Escann."

 escanni_not_migrating_tt:0 "The refugees will remain in our care."
 escanni_migrating_tt:0 "The refugees will leave for Escann."

 #Result of our refugee policy
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.t:0 "Result of our Refugee Policy"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.d:0 "It is a small thing, to hear children laugh together while playing, but it is a newfound peace for the Escanni. The parents in Escanni households tell stories where local folklore reinterpreted from their point of view, and Escanni staple dishes reimagined with local meats and legumes are being served to their children. No longer is there a divide between them and us. We now see each other as we truly are. We both share these lands, and they are welcome here."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.d2:0 "Indifference and fatigue: this is how most of our citizens would describe their feelings about refugees in our lands. This isn't necessarily for the worse; we tolerate each other, and that's a minimum if we desire to live in the same lands.\nIn the past few years the situation in the refugee communities has evolved in accordance with this policy. While we can still try to influence proceedings and results of this evolution it might prove costly.\n\nWhat shall be our direction?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.d3:0 "Our relationship with the refugees has soured greatly in the last few years. Some policies we have enacted have greatly upset them, and now the repercussions can be felt in any refugee settlement. They aren't hostile to us, but they have clearly closed ranks and do not desire to stay here.\nThey very much welcome our support for their return to Escann, and thank us for enabling them to return “Home”. Still, they do not know the dangers that still roam Escann; should we warn them or provide an escort? They might not make it if we stay idle."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.a:0 "We shall escort them safely to their new home."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.b:0 "They are free to go, but we will not help them."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.c:0 "Try to better their situation."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.e:0 "We welcome our new citizens with open arms."

 #Infamous robbers
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.t:0 "Infamous Robbers turn out to be Escanni refugees"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.d:0 "Robberies have skyrocketed across [This.GetName] in the past few years; after an investigation, it has been revealed that a group of refugees turned thieves were the culprits. The band have been stealing from people of all walks of life, looting everything from food to precious items, but they have never turned to outright violence.\nThey have been brought to [This.Capital.GetCapitalName] to be judged. Our people demand justice be brought to them at a sword’s edge. There are no questions of whether or not they are guilty; damning proof has been procured.\nYet the robbers claim that they had no choice but to turn to banditry because of their living conditions. As they deem their cause just, they demand a trial by combat as their traditions dictate.\n\nShould we abide by their ridiculous request or deal with them as we would for any other robbers?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.a:0 "The law shall take care of this accordingly."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.b:0 "Maybe our treatment of the refugees is wrong, we are to blame."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.c:0 "Let them have a trial by chivalry as their tradition dictates."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.e:0 "They are naught but thieves anyway, seize their assets and banish them."
 
 #Artisans complain
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.t:0 "Artisans Complain over Unregulated Competition"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.d:0 "A new popular good has spread in [This.GetName]: small trinkets carved out of wood and fashioned with straw, depicting foreign cavaliers and knights. While this is not something completely novel in itself, the origin of these trinkets is new. They are manufactured by Escanni refugees as a means to earn money, these symbols of a foreign culture very popular amongst our nobles and now even competing directly with some local toy makers.\nIn itself this is not an issue, to us anyway. But the local artisans are complaining that the refugees operate outside of any guilds, thus presenting unfair competition. As such the guilds have come forward and asked us to step in, as they do not want to bear any responsibility regarding this.\n\nWhat should be our approach?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.a:0 "Make the guild hire those Escanni artisans, they too have to operate under our regulations."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.b:0 "We can't have our artisans outcompeted by refugees and vagrants."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.c:0 "Nothing is as sweet as free labour."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.e:0 "Good craftsmen are always welcome in Esmaria."
 
 #Stories of the Greentide rouse our people
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.t:0 "Stories of the Greentide Rouse our People"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.d:0 "The refugees in our lands fled the Greentide and the chaos of war brought by the orcish hordes, and they have witnessed many horrors in Escann: from the soldier that survived the frontlines, seeing his brethren torn apart as their entrails splashed upon him, to the father unable to save his wife and son from the horror of starvation during their exodus.\nSuch gruelling stories and tales are often shared with the denizens of the towns and villages that live close to their settlements, riling them up and agitating the masses.\nFear and anger are spreading within our populace, all directed at the orcs and goblins of the Greentide for the horrors they have wrought. Panic could spread if left unchecked; this could be a problem, but it could also be leveraged to our benefit.\n\nWhat will be our course of action?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.a:0 "I too have heard the stories, and their anger is justified."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.b:0 "Appease the masses, our people do not need to be agitated so."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.c:0 "They are threatening the peace in our lands, crack down on the storytellers."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.e:0 "They should try to be more open minded."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.f:0 "They will be avenged, this I swear."
 
 #Distinguished refugees wish to join our court
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.t:0 "Distinguished Refugees Wish to Join our Court"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.d:0 "Those who fled Escann were not all peasants or artisans; some were more distinguished. Skilled traders, nobles and even renowned commanders fled when their kingdoms fell at the hand of the Orcs.\nSuch figures have found their way to our lands and they have now come forward seeking to join our ranks - for an appropriate reward, of course.\nHiring such talented individuals would be wise and could provide us with valuable assets in our court, but not everyone will appreciate their presence. Our own nobles and scholars might feel slighted by our decision, and as such we must exercise caution.\n\nMy [This.Monarch.GetTitle], what is your wisdom?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.a:0 "Trade knows no borders."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.b:0 "Recruit the commander, have them teach us the Escanni way of the sword."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.c:0 "We needed to refurbish the decoration of our halls, this is a good opportunity."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.e:0 "They are refugees, not migrants. They shall remain as such."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.f:0 "All that wish to join us shall, hire all of them."
 
 #Exiled soldiers wish to join the reclamation of Escann
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.t:0 "Exiled Soldiers Wish to Join the Reclamation of Escann"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.d:0 "Rumours of the budding success that adventurer companies are achieving in Escann has spread in the refugee communities and some seem to desire to join up with the adventurers to fight for their lands. The first official request to be trained for battle and then guided back to Escann has been delivered to us this morning.\nThese men and women seem hardy enough, but most of them have yet to see battle; sending them to Escann directly would probably be sending them to their death. We could respect their wishes and train them before they join the reclamation of Escann.\nThe other option is to use their desire for battle to our own ends, as we always need more men for our armies.\n\nWhat will we do with them?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.a:0 "Draft them into our army, they will be useful."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.b:0 "They have a right to fight for their lands; direct them to adventuring companies."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.c:0 "They shouldn't waste their lives on misguided desires."
 
 #Food supplies strained by overpopulation
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.t:0 "Food Supplies Strained by Overpopulation"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.d:0 "What we feared has come to pass, the granaries in multiple towns are almost empty. There are simply too many mouths to feed, the supplies and infrastructure of our nation unable to handle both the refugee population and our citizens. Something has to be done and we might have to choose who to feed. Famine is on the horizon if we do not act; not even the mice can find sustenance, the ravens and the crows have begun fleeing to other regions and are being hunted as subsistence fowl.\nSo far our planning and rationing have proved inefficient and after a harsh winter and a dry summer we have almost nothing left. Some of our allies might be able to help, if our purse doesn't do the trick of course.\nBut if we do not want our people to go hungry we must make a decision, one that might be hard; noone should starve, but do we value the refugees’ lives as much as we do our own people’s?\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.a:0 "Import all we need, no one will starve in our lands."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.b:0 "Implement rationning of the supplies we have, let us hope that suffices."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.c:0 "Our hands are tied, brace for the worst."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.e:0 "Our allies have our back, we will ask a favour from them."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.f:0 "Divert our exports to aid to the refugees."
 
 #Escanni Hedge-Mages run rampant!
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.t:0 "Escanni Hedge-Mages Run Rampant!"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.d:0 "Escanni wizards and witches have travelled and settled down in our lands with the refugees. With the chaos of the Greentide, many have turned against the dogma of the Magisterium and operate without licence. They are referred to as "Hedge-Wizards" or “Hedge-Mages”, and by practising their magic illegally, they pose a threat to our rule and the Magisterium's grip on wizarding.\nNo incident has occurred yet but the risk grows as time goes on. There are multiple solutions we could employ: on paper it is the duty of the Magisterium to deal with this, but whether or not they are up to the task is another question. We could also have our own wizards fill in, as they are more than eager to do so. Or, as no issues have arisen as of yet, we could leave the Hedge-Mages to do their thing, they might be harmless.\nWhat shall we do regarding these Hedge-Mages?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.a:0 "Send in our own wizards, they will do the job."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.b:0 "The Magisterium knows how best to deal with this."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.c:0 "Whatever, the Magisterium should stay out of our business."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.e:0 "The Magisterium is clearly not doing its job properly, recruit these wild mages."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.f:0 "They are quite bold to try this here."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.g:0 "I'll deal with this myself."

 #Escanni scholars seek refuge
 escanni_refugees_settlement.308.t:0 "Escanni Scholars Seek Refuge"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.308.d:0 "Many scholars and artists have fled Escann and dispersed across Cannor. They seek refuge in our court, and say that they will share with us what they have managed to save from Escann. They have brought with them some of the great art of the Escanni courts and a few secrets hidden in Castellyrian libraries.\nIf we were to accommodate them, it would surely bring forth a cultural renewal, possibly even a rebirth of chivalric ideals in our society, especially if we were to give them funds to spread their ways.\nSome among the court think that such Escanni thought is useless to us and might prefer if we were to do without these scholars.\n\nShall we fund this endeavour or keep to ourselves?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.308.a:0 "They will have money and recognition!"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.308.b:0 "We can spread their ideas, but we do not have the funds to hire them."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.308.c:0 "Escanni thought is a thing of the past, we don't need fossils in our court."
 
 #Sickness strikes the refugee camps
 escanni_refugees_settlement.309.t:0 "Sickness Strikes the Refugee Camps"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.309.d:0 "It all began in a crooked alleyway between two haphazard shacks, a minor chesty cough. Such a simple thing really, maybe even just a common sickness brought from abroad. But with the living conditions in the refugee settlements being what they are, this sickness has spread like a wildfire in their communities. Now the refugee camps are riddled with disease. The only thing spreading faster than the affliction is fear and all kinds of rumours are being circulated; some even say this might be the second coming of the White Pestilence, a baseless claim.\n\nNow the sickness threatens to spread to nearby villages and settlements of our own denizens. If we don't get this under control soon, our whole territory might be engulfed by this disease. Our officials suggest quarantining the refugees and sending them help; this would be costly, but if we don't help the refugees, their fate is likely sealed. We can also prioritise the safety of our own people, at the cost of the refugees’ wellbeing.\n\nWe have to act fast and decisively, what will be our course of action?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.309.a:0 "Quarantine the settlement and send teams of doctors inside to help."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.309.b:0 "Send goods to the refugees, but no one comes in or leave that place."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.309.c:0 "What's a little sickness going to do? We have faced worse before."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.309.e:0 "Cut off the camp from the exterior, we won't take any risks."
 
 #Refugees spread Corinite ideas
 escanni_refugees_settlement.310.t:0 "Refugees Spread Corinite Ideas"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.310.d:0 "When Corin joined the pantheon in 1445, many Escanni refugees devoted themselves to her, seeing Corin as their heroine and the one that put an end to the Greentide. Decades later with the Corinite Proclamation, a majority of refugees remaining in Wescann converted and some of our people are seemingly being influenced by them.\nIf we do not act, they might convince some of our own people to turn to Corinism. It isn’t necessarily a concern, but keeping things under control while we still can might be preferable, as these heretic beliefs could spread even further.\n\nWe can leave them be, but such autonomy could be a threat to us long term.

 escanni_refugees_settlement.401.d:0 "A group of migrants has been spotted on our borders. They seek to come to our lands and settle in what they call “Home”. They are the former inhabitants of these lands; most are happy with what we have achieved, but some are demanding we return some of their lands and homes, citing old property deeds that are near-unverifiable.\nWe are the ones in a position of power and whether we return their lands or not, they won’t have grounds to protest. But to secure our hold on the depopulated lands we are reclaiming, more people are more than welcome, and the price of their presence is accommodating these folk who lived here before. Our courtiers argue that this is a small price to pay for the stability and legitimacy they give us.\n\nWhat shall we do, my [This.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
