 cl_bonds_bluetusk_desc:0 "When Corin’s Circle came to the Counts League, the prior leadership had Lothane Bluetusk imprisoned for the nature of his birth, of being a half-orc. This foolish suspicion was the inciting incident after months of passivity that prompted Carleon to launch his coup and give support to the Circle on their way to Castonath. Since, Carleon has endevaoured to keep up in his letters with the Corintari leader and maintain good relations."

 cl_dragon_cannot_hear_desc:0 "The tide of the world turns and in this darkness the Silver Dragon remains silent. Truly felled by Zaamalot, we are alone and bereft. Our thoughts and prayers must then become action, to restore the realm that Castellos’ avatar gave his life to protect. This sacrifice and all the sacrifice in the wars of Chivalric Escann, of those who fell in the Greentide must not be flitted away. Even if he cannot hear us in the beyond of The White Citadel then we must still strive by his example."

 cl_centre_holds_title:0 "The Centre Holds"
 cl_centre_holds_desc:0 "We have expanded our dominion, the dream of that which was lost is something that still holds fealty from the adventurers and more besides within the White Walls. The dream of Castellyr is that of the feudal continuation of the power of antiquity that was Castanor and we have kept this alive and kept it well. We are the core that remains of that idea. So just as we survive, the centre holds."

 cl_delineating_borders_desc:0 "The Southern White walls, those on the Eastern side of Inner Castanor are the buildings into which we have made our home as part of making our stand. To this end with how the adventurers have scattered in the wake of the Battle of Castonath we must limit the potential for chaos by doing our best to establish our sovereignty over some of the old borders and by doing so lay greater claim to our providence over the whole of former Castellyr."

With kindness, with grace and through establishing greater relations we shall acquire their fealty in full."

 cl_first_steps_title:0 "The First Steps Back"
 cl_first_steps_desc:0 "The old leadership hid, too concerned with surviving only for themselves and not in reclaiming the homes of all the refugees and displaced peoples that have found themselves in our sanctum. It's time we cower no longer, we must stride and go forth and take steps to rebuild what was lost rather than just preserving what little remains."

 cl_costly_efforts_title:0 "Costly Efforts"
 cl_costly_efforts_desc:0 "We have defeated the Dogeater clan, but the cost is great. With so many who died and were displaced, scattered across Cannor, there are only so many Castellyrians who can wield arms  when so many must be designated for the repopulation of our lands and ensuring that there are people left to inherit when we are gone. To that end even strange bedfellows must be made and drastic action taken."

 cl_up_the_river_desc:0 "The Nath river was one of the lifebloods of Inner Castanor, so its security is vital to our ability to project power and also, crucially, to be able to supply the needs of the great stone city of Castonath. These lands are empty and so must be retaken, the Flung Head clan of goblins conquered so that they can be put to work for our sake just as the orcs did unto them."

And within too is a story of resilience, the Patricians who run the city had been able to survive through various means and it is time we great them as fellow legacies of the Escann that was; and shall be once again."

 cl_old_estates_desc:0 "Ebonmarck is a disputed area but is also the land our forebears found themselves in after the fall of Black Castanor, the disgraced descendants of one of the darkest figures in Cannorian history. Left with less and less land as it was hardly an illustrious legacy, the Blacktower family was moved around this region, across the borders of Vrorenmarch and Castellyr. Never having much in the way of prestige, they still learnt a lot from being cast out and moved about such that over the four centuries since the whole Ebonmarck has become familiar in how to administer it."

 cl_ascending_mount_title:0 "Ascending the Mount"
 cl_ascending_mount_desc:0 "The Trialmount is a storied place, for here is where the old trials of the Castans were partaken in, here the Ebonfrosts kept the hill under strong supervision and blocked the entrance of those outside the dynasty and in the wake of that history and four centuries of neglect the mountain is positively serene. The North Citadel sits here, its time has come to be restored in resplendent glory once more."

 cl_forcing_atonement_title:0 "Forcing Atonement"
 cl_forcing_atonement_desc:0 "The orcs came to Escann, driven by Korgus Dookanson, the Son of God to the vile purpose of the Greentide and the destruction of Chivalric Escann as we knew it. Over the last twenty years the realms that had been here were destroyed by organised campaigns with the intent that only the Orc would remain with all others enslaved or put to flight. Lothane Bluetusk and other half orcs remind us that the orcs are not inherently evil, but for what they have done they must atone."

 cl_sundering_society_title:0 "Sundering Their Society"
 cl_sundering_society_desc:0 "We have no intent to exterminate the orcs, nor send them on to Corin knows where. But it becomes clearer and clearer that for long term coexistence that they cannot be allowed to remain segregated from the general population. Their clans shall be destroyed as social entities and to this end we shall move them around our nation. It may result in friction but such is the best path forward for long term stability and an ability for us to move on from the past, as part of the Castellyr that will be."

 cl_blacktower_legacy_title:0 "Blacktower Legacy"
 cl_blacktower_legacy_desc:0 "House Blacktower was named after the dark citadel of Bal Vertesk, compared to many of the other houses of Escann there is little to be proud of. Venac’s son and first heir was Carleon the Inadequate for his lack of magical talent. Yet the Carleon Blacktower who leads us now is far from inadequate. His story is the start of a new legacy, one where the past exists as a challenge for us to overcome and we shall not disappoint."

 cl_stony_sleep_title:0 "Stony Sleep, Disturbed"
 cl_stony_sleep_desc:0 "The White Walls were onced locked after by the Wardens, an institution upheld by Castellyr so that this symbol of our resolve and history might never be lost. Yet the walls are silent, still as the night. Asleep, we hope for them to be dead would be too much to bear. The stone itself will wake as our garrisons march along its battlements one more and crenelations see use as the devastation passes and their resilience endures eternal."

Far from the cursed land that Oldhaven seems to be, the land is well equipped to handle many people and the ruins of the old buildings still provide solid foundations for us to rebuild from. We should invest in this place and move all we can from where dark dealings have been enacted. The Keep is a much safer redoubt and will benefit more from this investment, it will repay us in kind for what we put in."

 cl_ahead_of_you_title:0 "What is Ahead of You"
 cl_ahead_of_you_desc:0 "Our steps move with increasing confidence, where once we were on the brink now we can see something approaching the end in sight, where we can claim the mantle of what was lost in full and not be laughed at as pretenders by the other Cannorian powers and engage in full diplomacy as the de jure rulers of the greater part of Escann. All we need is to continue what we have done and bring those we give some autonomy more and more in line as things progress."

 cl_kindness_entrusted_title:0 "Kindness Entrusted"
 cl_kindness_entrusted_desc:0 "Carleon is gone. For someone who took us from strength to strength it seems hard to continue without him. Yet he and his confidants made sure that we would inherit his mantle in a fit state and that which began with him would be continued to fruition. Whatever lies ahead of us, the road may be long, its challenges fierce but the Counts League that strides forth to meet them and more will be one that owes itself to the education that Carleon passed on. For he was one who saw the good and bad of the old feudal order of Castellyr, what is to come will champion what made it great and discard what died with calamity."

 flavour_counts_league.1.t:0 "New Beginnings"
 flavour_counts_league.1.d:0 "As the sun entered its descent, Carleon Blacktower continued to trot around his recently attained estate. Their palatial nature would have allowed many to be distracted, the previous bickering owners for one. Those who had all but destroyed the last hope of Castellyr with petty disputes even as the kingdom lay in ruin. But for him the air of the place tasted strange in his lungs and prevented finding such peace here. The deal that they had made to keep this place suffered weighed on him, the truth of why they had always been so ‘patient’ hiding in this sanctuary amid the ruins of what had been all their homes.\n\nHe remembered the flight across from Ebonmarck, all the members lost along the way as they fought to join the nascent beginnings of this resistance where the minor nobility had gathered after the greatest died first. Carleon looked back to a time when his only worries were the sordid history of his forebears, the disrespect of Chivalric Escann. When he could breathe and smell the apples they grew back home. A place all but unknown to his daughter Kalista, somewhere he might never see again if he failed in leading the people of their redout.\n\nLarrien had saved him, his constant bulwark, she kept him from joining the ranks of the sour and dour among those who survived the Greentide only in that they remained breathing with all that made someone alive drained by harrowing experience. Larrien and Kalista kept him from feeling that same pull. The arrival of Corin’s Circle had revitalised his friends, moreso when he came to them with the plan to remove the incompetent and scared prior hegemon of the League. Rescuing Lothane had been a welcome bonus, Carleon taking a liking to the half-orc, finding in Lothane’s normalcy hope for all their future.\n\nThe messenger pigeon had come with the news of the previous day. Its contents why he had taken time to consider by his lonesome. A newcomer to the Court she would be, but like the Silver Dragon she had not stayed long. She had redeemed Agrados off all beings, there’d be hope yet for those inheriting a loathsome pact.\n\nHe wheeled about and cantered home. He still lived and he still had a beautiful daughter. Old he might be, he’d see Castellyr restored in full yet."

The new generations like Kalista and beyond represent the chance for a new history and story to be told.

The old white dragon flag sees more and more use as people do not feel they might be cursing us by bad luck or that our survival is premature. The task remains ahead but to see the old flags flutter in the wind is a source of pride for those who remember the old kingdom.\n\nIt may only be a physical item, but to see them mended and put up is something that is a reminder of what had been lost in this interregnum and what can be restored if we are fully successful. Our banner will expand and soon the internal flags of our vassals shall be replaced as they are integrated into our whole."

This was the land where the Blacktowers lived for the past four centuries and it was only with the coming of the Greentide that we were sent packing.\n\nThis land was where our lives were made and where Carleon among others was raised, it is a bittersweet to return when the entire other side of Castellyr has been our home for twenty years and more now.

Across the different eras, this empire survived with Escann as its imperial metropole. Till the Gerudians came in a time of weakness and the Ebonfrosts seized the empire for their own, Black Castanor being born and the trials that made one the next leader now put under guard to only allow Ebonfrost dynasts to attempt them.\n\nThis bastardisation would end with Castan the Enthralled and the final death of Nichmer on the mount, the devastation so terrible that the trials were destroyed and marred. Castanor itself was rent asunder, its constituent parts split into the kingdoms of Cast and Anor along feudal instead of imperial lines. The idea seemed gone, but then they united into Castellyr, a continuation of Castanor’s demsense, fully reunited behind the White Walls. It was a beautiful dream, cut short by the horrors of the Greentide before it had time to flourish in full when compared to the older realms of the Blademarches, Adenica and lost realms besides those.\n\nBut now Castellyr is back at hand, and perhaps in time Castan’s Empire too. It is much to ponder on as the current state of the Trialmount is taken in and then finally descended from."

People have already begun to go missing. Not many for now, but enough and with never a trace of orcs that we can be sure this is the price of the deal. We still cannot break it from our end and so the price is more anguish and toying torment from that creature. It isn’t enough to truly be felt in terms of an impediment, but that only makes it worse that the individual lives of people are being snuffed out and lost and that we are able to move on.\n\nThe tales come back in similar pattern, carried in whispered rooms of taverns as they begin to pile up. A distant voice lures away one person and they don’t come back that night. The next that same person’s voice calls out another, a wife or a husband and they’re gone too. In some cases then the children vanish the next night again and then once more. It seems the Hag of Oldhaven delights in the slow torment, in having people cower at night unable to graph the shape of the wicked thing that comes their way. \n\nThe only reason we even know any of this is due to the kindness of some neighbours who take in the children once they realise both parents are missing. Such simple kindness breaking whatever spell is brought upon the home and yet so many are paralysed and unable to be helped in this way even with ample warning."

The way in which it has come and gone has only added to the shock and ominous nature of these occurrences. It might not be devastating but the people are unsettled everywhere by how wide reaching this nightmare is, occurring wherever we plan our banner.\n\nThe idea that the Hag of Oldhaven’s power has grown with our expansion and that we have given her strength to perform this gives our inner circle pause.
