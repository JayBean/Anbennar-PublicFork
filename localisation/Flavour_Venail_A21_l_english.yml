 venail.1.d:0 "Alariandel is an old woman, who, legend tells, was born aboard a ship crossing a storm. She is recognized throughout the country, by virtue of her venerable age and experience, as one the best captains of the nation (alongside Calasandur). While the country is filled with a feeling of greatness and the desire to return to our origins, it is Alariandel who, after leaving retirement, will guide the effort of exploration with an iron hand and an unshakable will."

 venail.2.t:0 "Damescrown Loan"
 venail.2.d:0 "Although all of our people have a strong desire for reconquest, reclaiming Aelantir will be a long, arduous and difficult task. An option proposed by one of our advisors would be to ask the rich city of Damescrown to finance our colonial ventures through an exceptional loan. If we fulfill our duty by occupying Aelantir again, they will be sure to enjoy it more than anyone on Cannor."
 venail.2.a:0 "Send them the proposal!"
 venail.2.b:0 "We will accomplish our destiny alone."
 
 venail.3.t:0 "An Envoy from Venáil"
 venail.3.d:0 "Early in the morning, an elf envoy came to the doors of the Damescrown Town Hall, as a representative of Venáil, asking for an audience. He brings with him a most intriguing proposition. Venáil seem to have embarked on a massive colonization effort of the ancient world of Aelantir, and came to ask us to help them in their task through a huge loan. It's a gamble, but if they are successful in their ventures the benefits it could bring us are unimaginable."

Every meadow will be cultivated, every river exploited, every mountain explored, every secret discovered. And if, inadvertently, any entity comes to challenge our hegemony, we will make them understand that they have come to the wrong neighborhood, and knocked on the wrong door."

 venail.10.t:0 "The Harvest Begins" # Revitalize Economy
 venail.10.d:0 "For decades, or perhaps for centuries, our people have focused almost-exclusively on the migration. From the 100-year Damescrown Loan to the massive resource extraction projects in Venáil and Endralliande, our economy was geared towards one purpose: the return home.\n\nNow that we have achieved that great dream, we have lost that clear-cut focus. And we are left with the loans to pay — and already, the campaign plans drawn up by the strategist Sicrheior, and the great cathedral at Aelnar the priest-orator Dahvar is clamoring for, seem to demand we take more.\n\nEliendel, close advisor to [Root.Monarch.GetName], instructs us in a more fruitful direction: immediate investment in the facilities necessary to harvest the many fruits of this untapped land. All of Aelantir, a land bursting at the seams with ores to mine and flora to pluck is at our fingertips.\n\nFor years, we have sown..."
 venail.10.a:0 "...and now let us reap"
 
 venail.11.t:0 "The Coin Must Flow" # Trading Hub
 venail.11.d:0 "We mined out ten seams of ore, and yet the land still offers riches aplenty. We cut down a hundred trees in the Bloodgroves, and hardly seemed to make a dent. We caught a thousand fish, and the Ruined Sea still teemed with more.\n\nAelantir is ours, and ours alone. But the land has wealth beyond our imagining, and we can hardly use — or even store —  all we harvest. While the glass-worker (and trouble-maker) Aelthanas is advocating we give this surplus directly to the people, there is a better idea: selling it. Even sending a small amount back east would be enough to finance even the expansionist Sicrheior's wildest dreams."
 venail.11.a:0 "All the coin of Cannor shall be ours"
 
 venail.12.t:0 "A Steady Hand at the Tiller" # Stabilize
 venail.12.d:0 "The first returning Moon Elf to set foot in the land that would become our capital Aelnar was Lithiel Oathkeeper, Lieutenant-at-Arms (and subsequently, Pathfinder) of the Cothaadael. The second was the ship's first mate, the third the ship's captain. For each, it seemed momentous, their first steps in the land of their fathers' and their fathers' fathers, the land of their ancestors.\n\nBut somewhere around the hundredth returnee, while the momentousness did not lessen, the pressing needs of building homes against the wind and fires against the chill took on a more salient import. And while we have long-devoted our entire state to this migration, and readied the capital for our arrival, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s close advisor Eliendel has made clear not every piece of Aelnar is ready the same way. Though any elf would die happy knowing they were to be buried in Aelantir (indeed if one believes Dahvar's theology it would mean they were eternally blessed), we cannot afford to waste a single life in our colonization.\n\nWe have become experienced sailors, capable of keeping ships afloat even in the stormy waters of Uelos' Lament, but now we must make calm the realm itself."
 venail.12.a:0 "We cannot falter now!"
 
 venail.13.t:0 "Forging a Crown" # Renovate Political System
 venail.13.d:0 "At sea, the Migrant Fleet was nigh-anarchic, every ship for itself. On the island of Venáil, we organized into a vaguely-republican council, drawing upon the Moon Elves' best in pursuit of our singular vision. Now that we have returned to Aelantir, we must reimagine ourselves once more.\n\nAelthanas, the glass-worker turned philosopher-advocate, is calling on [Root.Monarch.GetName] to step down, and open the leadership up to a complete democracy. Ever-charismatic, and ever-scheming, Dahvar, whispers of theocratic rule, replacing our previous unity of vision with a unity of faith. There are even some fools — blinded by ideas of 'heroism' — who speak of elevating Lithiel, anointing her 'Heroine of the Reconquest' and placing a crown on her head.\n\nThere shall be a crown, forged of Aelantiri iron, set with Aelantiri rubies and sapphires and diamonds. But it shall be placed on the head of [Root.Monarch.GetName], and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] alone."
 venail.13.a:0 "Hail to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 
 venail.14.t:0 "Review the Troops" # New Elven Legion
 venail.14.d:0 "On Venáil, we only mustered a token force, knowing every piece of metal was better used in ship-building than armor-smithing, and trusting in the Seawatcher's wooden wall to keep us safe. Our already-skeletal forces only dwindled when the great migration began, as many soldiers were inspired by Lithiel to head west as Pathfinders. During those last few years, it seemed the 'army' consisted of a handful of young recruits, a few elderly blademasters, and of course the steadfast warrior Kayd, about as easily dislodged from his Sergeant rank as a mountain.\n\nBut our days on Venáil are gone now, and never shall we return to them. Today, [Root.Monarch.GetName] reviews the new legions mustered in crisp ranks in the fields outside Aelnar. Even as Eliendel's ink-stained hands go through the various papers outlining their disposition, whispering details to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the gleaming steel and row upon row of Elven might speak a much louder story.\n\nKayd steps forward from the first rank,  drawing his blade. As he salutes, every one of the thousands of soldiers assembled behind him does the same."
 venail.14.a:0 "The blade itself incites to deeds of violence."
 
 venail.15.t:0 "A Teal Ocean" # The Teal Armada
 venail.15.d:0 "For century upon century upon century, we wandered the waves. But we wander no longer. And as [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazes upon the Teal Armada, docked in Aelnar harbour, dyed sails mounted on Bloodgroves wood, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows the truth: our domain shall extent beyond the lands of Aelantir to include the seas as well.\n\nSicrheior is already advocating we use the fleet for island-hopping, multi-directional, expansion; Kayd's deep voice tells the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it should ferry expeditionary forces to claim new regions with blood and steel; Lithiel would commandeer at least one ship to just explore our home — and revel in the fact we have finally returned to it.\n\nToday, the Armada shall be put to use deterring pirates. But tomorrow?"
