 U11_the_first_goblin_navy_title:0 "The First Goblin Navy"
 U11_the_first_goblin_navy_desc:0 "Every child who shivers around a hearthfire in early Nerament begs grandmother to tell once more the Deed of the Crossing. In our moment of misery, driven from our home in the Serpentspine by the orcish scourge and pinned outside the great fortress of Bal Ouord, we could have given in. The Landshark clan could have dispersed to the winds, begging for shelter, merging into the nations of others. Instead we moved west to hard lands on a windswept coast, and with ingenuity and tenacity built, seized and mastered a half-wrecked flotilla of rafts, fishing dinghies, caulked galleys and old merchant’s hulks. Taking to the waters, we have carved out a clandom on both sides of the gulf, and survived against the odds. If we truly wish to rule this sea, though, we cannot settle for a tinkerer’s fleet forever under repair. We must build a modern navy that can go toe-to-toe with the merchantmen of Katrano and the pirates of Nathalaire, and turn this gulf from obstacle into causeway."
 U11_naval_stronghold_title:0 "Naval Stronghold"
 U11_naval_stronghold_desc:0 "We may have sundered the great fortress of the Ourdi, but we more than most respect its commanding position over our home waters. The land stoops jealously over this place, the very tip of the gulf, now the heart of our country. We will make a cove of it, a place for our sharks to circle and brood before the next terror raid. Wavebreaks, a walled harbour, emplacements for our cannon; when we are finished, Bal Ouord will be as impregnable by sea as we found it by land."
 U11_control_the_trade_title:0 "Control the Trade"
 U11_control_the_trade_desc:0 "Our scrabbling and clawing for purchase is over; this land is ours, and we may finally lift our eyes to the western horizon. There we see the levy-ports of the Crathánori, bleeding our traders dry and denying us the freedom of the sea, to say nothing of the piracy that these feckless and decadent trade guilds allow to run rampant in their waters. If we are to do more than simply live - if we are to thrive - we must trade on our own terms, and tighten our grip on sea traffic in and out of the Gulf. Important above all else is Gemisle, a wealthy port and strategic position from which to defend our shipping lanes. We see a time not long from now where every Landshark trader will know this; he is guarded by a predator more fearsome than any petty raider."
 U11_security_through_force_title:0 "Security Through Force"
 U11_security_through_force_desc:0 "The tradesmen of these waters have drawn back from all-out war on piracy, fearing as merchants do the cost of blood. But sharks do not fear blood. As long as the raiders have their dens, they will return again and again, perhaps weakened but never truly defeated. The path ahead of us is simple - drown these rats in saltwater and take their city for our own, turning their shadowed refuge into a base for our purge. Our children will never again fear a sail on the horizon."
 U11_blood_in_the_water_mission_title:0 "Blood in the Water"
 U11_blood_in_the_water_mission_desc:0 "Just as the Gulf of Ouord thrusts like a fang into the flesh of the Overmarch, so must we strike, now and hard and fast. We cling to the bays and inlets of the Ourdi coast, our grip tenacious, but we are surrounded by old enemies and much hated. We have yet to make right our grudge against the witch-goblins to the north, who took our exodus as an opportunity for plunder and daughter-stealing, and the King in Ourdia will never leave us be until his castle at Bal Ouord falls. The clan-speakers are rare in their unanimity; if we are to preserve our lives and our honour, we must raise a general levy and finally avenge these feuds. Our weapons are the toothed crags of our new home, and a people who are finished with running."
 U11_hour_of_devastation_title:0 "Hour of Devastation"
 U11_hour_of_devastation_desc:0 "In our time of desperation, none we met offered mercy. Chased west by the endless stinging raids of Oubblig’s accursed heirs, our long migrant column collided with the armies of humanity. Since they could not best us on the battlefield, they hid in their dwarf-built fortress and called themselves victors, while our babes starved on the teat. Now we rise from the depths as the white death of the frothing surf. Let the Ourdi continue to cower, clothed in the crumbling mantle of history - they will drown in the same tide that throws over their walls."
 U11_victors_of_the_decade_title:0 "Victors of the Decade"
 U11_victors_of_the_decade_desc:0 "Triumph is not the moment the blood runs from a enemy’s flank. It is the day when a clanman, taking the coast road from Bal Ouord to Madiroud, can greet every fellow he sees with an open smile. The shipwrecks he spots from his vantage on the bluff are ancient and long stripped clean, the farmsteads fresh-plastered, trailing fat columns of woodsmoke into the sky. The fences are a little crooked, yes, but mended and loved, and the clanman leaves a few coins in the honesty box, takes a few eggs for the road. An entire generation is being born who will catch a ferry across the gulf and find themselves utterly bored, scarcely imagining that their boredom is the sweetest fulfillment of their parents' dreams."
 U11_securing_bahari_import_title:0 "Securing Bahari Import"
 U11_securing_bahari_import_desc:0 "The Bahari have long traded directly with their human counterparts to the west, bypassing our home waters as pirate-infested wastelands. Their ships went as far as Gemisle or Katrano, and no further. In response to our mastery of the Flooded Coast, they spurn us once more, travelling directly from Re’uyel to the Isle of Tef and starving us of commerce. It is clear that we must force the Bahari to the table, leaving them no ports but ours in the northern Divenhal. Ringed by our teeth, the human traders will have no choice but to venture into the shark’s maw."
 U11_coveted_lands_title:0 "Coveted Lands"
 U11_coveted_lands_desc:0 "The dream of the great Clanboss Jenthib was simple - forge for the people of Landshark a home of our own, unthreatened by the whim of orc or human or dwarf. The people of this world look on us as savages for demanding those things which they see as their natural due - a warm bed, a life lived free of siege, for our children to grow up unscarred by war. This is what we have carved out for ourselves, our gift to our descendants. We invest the trading wealth of Bahar in the security of every village, our clan councils mediate disputes with impartiality and fairness, and even those who hate us can no longer simply swat at us unthinkingly. We have become masters of the northern Divenhal, a country of thriving homesteads."
 U11_call_to_the_scattered_title:0 "Call to the Scattered"
 U11_call_to_the_scattered_desc:0 "We recount the Exodus as a lonely time, our struggling migrant caravan wandering west with scarce allies and many enemies, and yet the few friends forged in such a time are never forgotten. Hard choices forced clans away from us, or stranded them in the Deepwoods, or left them scattered across mountain, highland, wasteland. With troubles at every border, it is easy to forget that we are among the luckiest and most successful of the goblin exodites - we should share the wealth, and invite these small bands and stragglers back to our hearth."
 U11_debt_unpaid_title:0 "Debt Unpaid"
 U11_debt_unpaid_desc:0 "We would still be slaves were it not for the intervention of the forest goblins far to our northeast, who broke the orcish yoke around our necks and made our Exodus possible at all. What a contrast they are in their nobility and honour to the children of Oubblig, those fey-cursed witchfolk who harassed us all the way west, forcing us up against the walls of Bal Ouord. How sweet it is, then, that a feud owed and a debt owed can be repaid in the same moment. We will push from the south in concert with our friends from the east, and we will end Oubblig’s legacy for good."
 U11_elite_green_marines_title:0 "Elite Green Marines"
 U11_elite_green_marines_desc:0 "A great strength of our country is the vastness of its levy - our ranks now swell with shore goblins who know the sea intimately, and come to us familiar with the discipline of the boat. Yet there is a real difference between the fierce fisher boy and the soldier, a change only time or effort can effect. We don’t seek to abandon our navy for land - quite the opposite. We seek to take fishermen and make marines of them, create a soldiering elite as comfortable on land as at sea, capable of rising with the tide, striking hard and then retreating unscathed. In doing so, we can make up some of the distance between us and our neighbours. Our pledge is to master the waves in fifty years as the humans have in a thousand."
 U11_cypress_shipwrights_title:0 "Dedicated Shipyard"
 U11_cypress_shipwrights_desc:0 "Now that trade flows west to us from the great cities of Bulwar, we take on a new mantle - protector of the northern Divenhal and true naval power. Up to now, our navy has operated under a requisition system, under which each local clan and coastal village contributes to overall naval production. If we want to build a true grand fleet, maintain exacting building standards and effect swift repairs, we will need to centralise our boatbuilding. The strip of land chasing the coast south from Aqatbar is famous for the finest timber in the Divenhal, felled from immense stands of tall, sturdy cypress. Let us bring together these superior materials and our wide base of skilled shipwright labour into dedicated shipyards, capable of supporting a Divenhal-spanning navy."
 U11_gnoll_migrants_title:0 "Gnoll Migrants"
 U11_gnoll_migrants_desc:0 "We hear that the gnolls of Daravan’s Folly are a savage and benighted folk, lacking civilisation or decency, rightly hated by all they come into contact with. Well, the same has been said of us. It is a noble thing to offer a rejected people a place by the fire, and the gnolls bring with them a fierce tradition of battle, with warlords who have earned their place at the head of the column. They also suffer under a great burden - the utter hostility of the blighted Dreadmire, whose ancient curse still relentlessly harries those who try to settle there permanently. We will make overtures to some of the closer tribes, offering them and their leaders a place by our side. Their strength and tenacity can only aid our efforts."
 U11_accursed_lands_title:0 "Accursed Lands"
 U11_accursed_lands_desc:0 "We have been accustomed to feel that the world ends in the north where the great fens begin; the Dreadmire is a vast natural barrier, long ago lost to its eroding curse. Since we have begun to settle here we have been hunted and haunted, our efforts at construction stymied by a miasma which eats at the works of sentient beings, undermines foundations, fells cottages and subsumes them into the acid stink of this ancient bog. We have set ourselves upon ending this curse. To do so, we will require a magic we have generally put aside in our pursuit of wind and wave. Our forest goblin friends are familiar with the nature of curses that shift and spread in the environment, accustomed as they are to a constant struggle with the Deepwoods. We will call upon their expertise, and together finally undo the folly of Daravan."
 U11_coastal_reclamation_title:0 "Coastal Reclamation"
 U11_coastal_reclamation_desc:0 "It is human wastefulness which leaves potentially useable land fallow, and we goblins have lived through much which would have undone others. We are under no illusions; the Dreadmire is a treacherous, stark terrain. But we goblins are tenacious, and there is good, fertile land to be drawn up from the water. We will offer stipends, materials, low wooden punts to navigate the shallow waters. We will grant land and authorise the settlement of new clans and homesteads, and of yet another hostile land make a home."
 U11_flamemarked_warriors_title:0 "Flamemarked Warriors"
 U11_flamemarked_warriors_desc:0 "For some time now we have welcomed the Flamemarked Gnolls into our military and clan-structure, recognising their settlements on an ad hoc basis the same way we would with any goblin clan. In such a way the gnolls of Landshark may retain self-governance and make independent petitions to the crown. As time goes on, though, more and more gnolls leave their clans and work or live among ours, as we do theirs. The idea of the gnolls as an entirely separate people is becoming increasingly outdated, and yet it would be a great loss to lose their ferocious fighting style and experience. Our logisticians have made an interesting proposal - they argue we should create a professional Hogxobit, a ''deep pack'', drawn from our entire gnollish population and rewarded with great honour, and reprieve the gnoll clans from our general levy altogether. Our enemies will quake at the sight of such a vanguard."
 U11_folly_no_more_title:0 "Folly No More"
 U11_folly_no_more_desc:0 "The northwest of our country is a unique place. Travelling by punt from Ciernhibin, one comes upon the timber frame of a new farmhouse. Gnoll labourers carry great logs of timber, split and treat them, and heave them up into new walls, while a few yards away a small work team of goblins shingles the roof of an outbuilding, antlike and precise. Move a little further into the fen and one passes a gorgeous stand of pear trees raised on a small hillock-island - their forester dozes in the afternoon sun, one of the happy few who moved here from the Deepwoods to cleanse the place, then stayed. The villages of the Dreadmire are practically ports, drawing up land in narrow reinforced strips to plant great marrows and oilseed, and yet the yields returned on even these small plots are astonishing. It is an idyll, one built by us; each hectare of this place cleared by our craft and our will. The new Dreadmire is a testament to goblin ingenuity and adaptability. Soon, its name will denote only a dark history, a tale to give children a thrill."
 U11_develope_tradegoods_title:0 "Sharks Seeking Seafood"
 U11_develope_tradegoods_desc:0 "Of the many great changes we have withstood during our exodus, it is a new life by the sea which is the strangest. Our land is marginal in many places, and we would not survive without fishing, opportunistic seaweed farming or oyster-picking. We can do more with the bounty of the Gulf than just feed ourselves, though. Whitefish spawning grounds in our coastal shoals promise a succulent roe, no less delicious than that sold in Crathánor, and the eastern coast of the Gulf forms miles and miles of shallow flats, perfect for saltpans. We will channel our growing expertise into a burgeoning food economy and bring prosperity to the clans."
 U11_imitate_human_trade_title:0 "Imitate Human Trade"
 U11_imitate_human_trade_desc:0 "The contempt of human kings does not often move us. They think us little better than animals, and so we know we must be ready for war - it is as simple as that. We have little hope of convincing these higher majesties that we are worth speaking to. Their traders, though - they are motivated by different instincts: less bound to rigid honour, less easily shocked, more curious, more adventurous. We can move a little to accommodate these people, organise ourselves in ways they begin to recognise, adopt certain guarantees they find palatable. In return, they can give us information and serve as hosts in cities otherwise hostile to us. Our greatest asset is our adaptability; we intend to learn everything useful we can from humans, and discard the rest."
 U11_establish_civil_trade_title:0 "Establish Civil Trade"
 U11_establish_civil_trade_desc:0 "We may still be unpalatable diplomatically to the many human kingdoms of the west, but even they have eyes to see our staunch opposition to piracy. If only to set the shark against the sea snakes, they will humour us, and allow our traders access to their ports. In the Divenhal, all commerce eventually finds its way to the Isle of Tef, and so must we. We will expand our fleets, set up clanhouses and reliable, impartial weighing services, make ourselves a part of the settled landscape of trade. There will come a time soon when the flag of Landshark and the sight of a civilised goblin will be a familiar thing across the northern Divenhal, barely worthy of comment."
 U11_display_of_connections_title:0 "Display of Connections"
 U11_display_of_connections_desc:0 "Largely barred from royal courts and long looked upon with hatred, we have been forced to build relations from the bottom up, wherever we can find a way in. A glazier in Brasan, a mine-owner in Azka-Evran, a provisioner in Birsartansbar, a clothier in Doveswall, a brewer in Port Jaher, a jeweller in Eborthíl - every Kartel-clan has cultivated a constellation of friendly contacts in ports throughout the Divenhal, and in so doing achieved the odd invitation, the odd chance to make real diplomatic connections. It is time to pull on these ties, leverage them for the good of Landshark, and finally arrive in the halls of the wealthy and powerful."
 U11_to_stand_equal_title:0 "To Stand Equal"
 U11_to_stand_equal_desc:0 "It happens slowly, and requires great patience. A human merchant loses everything in a shipwreck, and his generous goblin creditor forgives the debt, if only he will talk to his brother the magistrate about some trifling harbour rights. Seeing the burnt ruin of a tavern, a goblin kartelman buys the plot, rebuilds the tavern and allows the human owner to keep running it rent-free, so long as Kartel goblins may stay for free and go unmolested. Moments like these are weapons no less powerful than a musket, and our traders have engineered many such moments over the years, completed thousands of honourable trades across a sea kept tranquil by our circling sharks. Our last step is to meet Kings as equals, and finally emerge as a respected power on the world stage."
 
 #Events
 exodus_goblin_flavour.19.t:0 "Fall of Bal Ouord"
 exodus_goblin_flavour.19.d:0 "They worked in shifts. It was the only way to keep the kneading going over so many hours, and it could not be slackened for even a moment, or they would do more damage to themselves than the Ourdi. Tanglit trudged abovedeck just as the sun sank under the horizon - a horizon flanked by the twin arms of Landshark territory, soon to be united. He was happy to be working the night; the twilight sea air refreshed him, kept him awake through the monotony and the sway back and forth of the siege-galley in the water, like a mother’s cradling.\n\nThe shamans who were coming off-duty released their grip one-by-one. They stood at sundial positions around the weapon; as they let go, their shift partners took over. The white-blue orb shook only slightly, not losing any of its compression. They all took a breath. It was such an insignificant thing - a child’s marble, suspended in the air.\n\n"We’re close," said Tanglit, mostly to himself. Everyone was concentrating too much to chat. They had been kneading the weapon for weeks now, pouring their magic into this single place, forcing all the spare energy of forty-or-so mortal wills into a single deliberate catastrophe. He took up his post, and felt the immense strain of the thing they had created together, an animal god desperately pulling at her reins. The five hours until the moment of victory passed as a second.\n\nIn the years to come, Tanglit was asked many times to tell the story of the Ouordsundering; by his brothers, by fellow courtiers in the clanhall of the new King, by men in the pub who’d heard a rumour or two, by his nephews and nieces and eventually their children. He told them about sounds; the immense crack as though the world was splitting open eighteen times - once for each galley - and the slow, dreadful heave of collapsing battlement. With a crooked smile he told of the drinking, of sneering humanity brought low, of the satisfaction of knowing that we sea-rats had won.\n\nHe did not say other things, especially to his grandnephews, who had grown up indoors and feared nothing at all. He did not talk about the seventeenth galley, splintered and bobbing in the oil-black water. There were a few sounds he did not mention, that went on long after the walls were overrun, and which he still heard in his sleep. He did not talk about the morning, a few days after the wall fell, when he came upon a tiny corpse in the courtyard of the Arkwrights Guild, and could not say whether it was a goblin woman or a human child. He did not admit that by then, he did not care.\n\nInstead he gathered the children together in the unhurried, indulgent way of the uncle, and held the hand of the most timorous, and let them argue over where to go and what to eat, in the city that was theirs."
 exodus_goblin_flavour.19.a:0 "Never again will our people be homeless."
 exodus_goblin_flavour.20.t:0 "To Cleanse the Land"
 exodus_goblin_flavour.20.d:0 "A second delegation arrived as the night drew in, their torches pinpricks in the gloom, spotted from the walls of Bal Ouord long before their final approach. The speakers considered not allowing them entry at all, and stood muttering in small groups in the great stone hallways of the clan-hall, yawning and dithering in their night-robes. In the end, though, they relented. In dealings with the fey it paid to be polite, even or perhaps especially when one intended to turn them down.\n\nThis oddball group of charlatans, warlocks and outcast goblins came unbidden - how they came to know of the summit remained distressingly vague. The shamans, both those of Landshark and those of her forest allies, were up in arms immediately. They argued that even to meet with the warlocks was to invite disaster, that such work as needed doing in the cursed lands was an act of patience, of communion with the land. Tempting, yes, to entrust a little of yourself to the fey to avoid a hardship, to avoid waiting, but there is always a cost. Sometimes to do something right is to accept that it will take time.\n\nIt wasn’t that the clanspeakers did not listen. They feared and respected their shamans, and knew that such a spirited intervention was rare enough to be worth taking into account. The feytalkers did not hide the cost of such a pact, either; sailor-mages given to the forest for a time, so that the fey would forever know a few of Landshark’s secrets. Tribute and sacrifice, both as part of the ritual itself and as part of thankful deference towards the fey. And a lot of will, a lot of energy. It was hard to see how the fey would agree to an exchange that did not balance in their favour, and this made the clanspeakers wary.\n\nAnd yet… Landshark was not alone in its ambitions towards the Flooded Coast. Goblins more than most knew how to make use of marginal terrain, and drained wetland made for good farming, good homesteading and bird-fishing. Properly claimed, the Dreadmire could form a vast march through which enemies would have to squelch for weeks, and it would not be left alone forever. If Landshark did not act now, others would act in their absence. In the lonely, ancient towers of Bal Ouord, the clanspeakers brooded over what to do."
 exodus_goblin_flavour.20.a:0 "We will strike a bargain with the fey."
 exodus_goblin_flavour.20.b:0 "It's not worth it - our shamans counsel wisdom, and we follow their guidance."
 exodus_goblin_flavour.21.t:0 "Coastal Reclamation"
 exodus_goblin_flavour.21.d:0 "A small fleet of punts crowds the riverdock upstream of Ciernhibin, ready to venture into the Dreadmire. The families who gather here will seed a new clan in the shallow waters of Daravan’s Folly. There are a few shamans among them to aid with earthshaping, but mostly it is simple people: the unlucky looking for a fresh start, the bold in search of adventure, the broke gambling on prosperity. They will go and turn small cleansing outposts into settlements, raise townships and eventually cities from the shallow waters. The only question that remains is where to direct them."

 exodus_goblin_flavour.22.t:0 "The Banquet"
 exodus_goblin_flavour.22.d:0 "Tanchi led her servers back down the service corridor, stopping before the east entrance of the Big Hall. She watched her ducklings form up behind her, her beady eyes flickering down the column for lapses in uniform, but her people knew tonight was important. Eventually, she nodded. "Big smiles, everyone," she said, and pushed open the door.\n\nThe hall's immensity still shocked newer arrivals, little cousins of the royal clan too far from succession to be anything but royal staff. They couldn’t resist the urge to stare straight upwards, lost in the maze of stone vaults and spans, the ancient, faded carvings so far off the ground that it seemed absurd they had been built for mortal eyes. It had been necessary to bring the scale of the space down, and so each table had been set in its own temporary little room, walled on three sides by richly curtained barriers. The only exception was the royal table in the dead centre, where the leaders sat. All the other tables in the room faced this central table, and so from above they formed a great flower blossom. The barriered tables made for deep conversation, encouraged a feeling of privacy, of disinhibition and closeness. Every now and then Tanchi could hear a burst of laughter from one enclosure or another, as if from the window of a tavern.\n\nHer team carefully handed some of their ceramic dishes to the group who were waiting on the royal table - they would be glued there all night, ready to serve immediately. Truthfully, Tanchi barely thought about being only a few feet from so much power. To her, everyone here might as well have been interchangeable stomachs; it wasn’t her job to care about anything else.\n\nTanchi had come up from the scullery maids, and she was not too proud to get stuck in with her team. Soon she found herself by a table of willowy, teak-skinned elves. She waited for a lull and approached, placing the great dish and lifting its lid as the elves watched. Steam billowed into the air as it had at every other table, a village of chimneys on a cold night. The elves leant forward to inspect the main course - shark, naturally.\n\n"I can serve it for you, if you prefer." She still felt a little awkward in the presence of elves; felt their age, wondered about all they had seen in their time, the breadth of their world. Hers was this place - this fortress she knew like her own heartbeat - and nowhere else. \n\nOne of the women waved her off, the light from the table lamp glinting on her rings, on the silver brocade in her gown sleeve. "No no, darling, we want to get into the spirit of things."\n\n"Gosh, say what you want, but these gobbos know how to steam a fish." Tanchi was already leaving, and only barely heard her say it, and yet a quiet smile danced on her lips."
 exodus_goblin_flavour.22.a:0 "We've truly arrived."
 exodus_goblin_flavour.23.t:0 "A Complex, A Capital"
 exodus_goblin_flavour.23.d:0 "Since the time of the great western Exodus we have been accustomed to peripatetic rule, largely defined by the military need of the moment. As we assert ourselves as an equal to our neighbours, the clanspeakers increasingly counsel [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]  [Root.Monarch.GetName] to establish a formal court and palace for Landshark, an extended clan complex that can deal with the complicated bureaucracy of a growing and prosperous state. Though [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has established itself as a gathering place for our quartermasters and logisticians, there is no overwhelming consensus that it should be our capital or the site of our ruling complex, and this has become a source of intense debate.\n\nSpeaker Makcha’s Shark tendency is arguing for the complex to be built at Bal Ouord, the traditional centre of authority in the Overmarch and a key strategic fortress and port. She argues that invoking the legacy of Bal Ouord is a good way to legitimise the state and impress envoys, as well as keeping the extended family of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] safe. It is a place with ancient history, visually impressive, and a symbol of our successes on land and at sea. It also already has a significant goblin minority, who know the city and its byways intimately.\n\nThe Open Trade tendency led by Speaker Adgak is arguing for Katrano, a city and canton surrounded on three sides by water, the old capital of the Crathánori. They view a Katrano capital as a chance to stamp Landshark identity on a city not quite as long-lived as Bal Ouord. Katrano is also the country’s economic heart, sitting along every major sea route in the northern Divenhal and gazing across the water at the trading hub of Gemisle. It is a green and pleasant land, perfect for construction and expansion, which favours no existing clan and allows for a city truly in our image.\n\nOf course, there is always the choice to formalise and expand our court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] - it has the weight of tradition, and represents our pride in the Exodus, of making do with the resources available to us. It is also a place firmly under the control of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Regardless of where we hang our cloaks, this is a clear sign that we are no longer a straggling band but a country, ready to formalise our state bureaucracy."

 landshark_goblin_sailors_desc:0 "Every crag and promontory of the Gulf of Ouord hosts a goblin fishing village, and each of these villages considers itself a small part of the navy, one of the shark’s teeth. They know which knots to tie, how to pack the hold efficiently, which households have sons ready to fight. To defend the water is to defend the hearth, and the people of Landshark volunteer freely and ferociously."
 landshark_goblin_sailors_upgraded:0 "Sharpened Teeth"
 landshark_goblin_sailors_upgraded_desc:0 "As our technology has improved and our cities have become more sophisticated, the young goblins who come aboard for their traditional years at sea bring new expertise - engineering, bookkeeping, construction and increasingly artificiery, which we have embraced like few others in our region. We blur the line between navy and standing army, and practically every ship in the fleet can refit itself for siege in short order." 

 #Government Reform
 landshark_adoptive_kartel_clans:0 "Adoptive Kartel-Clans"
 landshark_adoptive_kartel_clans_desc:0 "Initial attempts to trade with the humans to our west were stymied by their misunderstanding of clan structure and our rules of common property; they walked away from individual clans believing they had negotiated trade deals with the entire country, or were entirely rebuffed, not yet having earned the trust necessary for a deal based on pledges. To deal with this we have created kartel-clans with jurisdiction over specific industries, backed and funded by the crown; this is the closest we can get to a guild-like institution without rupturing our clan structure. These clans will mass-adopt fluent speakers of Crathánori, maintain their own networks of contacts in cities around the northern Divenhal, deal with disputes, and negotiate lodging for foreign merchants in our major settlements."
