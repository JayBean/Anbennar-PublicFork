 B50_a_seed_sown_title:0 "A Seed, Sown"
 B50_a_seed_sown_desc:0 "Once, we found ourselves strangers in this strange land. At every turn, we saw the unfamiliar - things foreign to our Small Country upbringings. And yet, we have fought for our place here. We have started to tame the forests and fields, setting down roots with which to establish ourselves. Now, we proclaim a new banner; one of a new halfling nation, where we may finally throw off the yoke of our taller oppressors. No longer are we strangers here! These lands shall be ours to grow!"
 B50_out_of_the_frying_pan_title:0 "Out Of The Frying Pan"
 B50_out_of_the_frying_pan_desc:0 "We have done our part to repel the Greentide, but we did not do it alone. Dotted across Escann, between orcs, goblins, and rivals alike, are potential allies waiting to be brought to our tables. Let us reach out to them once more, to secure our place in these lands; only then can we ensure that they prosper."
 newshire_frying_pan_tooltip:0 " countries with their capital in Escann have at least 120 opinion of Newshire."
 B50_into_the_fire_title:0 "Into The Fire"
 B50_into_the_fire_desc:0 "Although the reach of Newshire has already grown from our humble adventurer beginnings, our borders must continue to expand before we can truly be safe in our position. Our original home in Upcreek, alongside the fertile provinces to its west, would be a perfect starting point for our fledgling nation. Once we control the area, we can call in fellow halflings from across Cannor, eager to settle a new homeland - it might upset the natives, but the future of our people depends on it!"
 displacement_tooltip:0 "The culture and religion of the area will change to match our primary culture and religion."
 displacement_escin_tooltip:0 "The culture and religion of the province the headquarters is based in will change to match our primary culture and religion."
 B50_our_fellow_small_fellows_title:0 "Our Fellow Small Fellows"
 B50_our_fellow_small_fellows_desc:0 "This new home of ours may be enticing, but we shouldn't forget the places we came from. Indeed, we would do well to establish ties with some of our fellow halfling nations, that we might weather our troubles together. Let us set up safe routes of travel for our diplomats back to the western side of the Dameshead, to make these ties a bit easier to bind."
 B50_riddles_in_the_dark_title:0 "Riddles In The Dark"
 B50_riddles_in_the_dark_desc:0 "They're definitely not halflings, but our people and the dwarves of Halann ought to stick together. We might be small, but by combining our attitudes with their artificery, we can become greater than the sum of our parts. By inviting a few to settle in our capital, we can begin that process sooner rather than later."
 B50_buzzing_sounds_title:0 "Buzzing Sounds"
 B50_buzzing_sounds_desc:0 "Though the bees of Escann are capable of doing their jobs, they simply don't compare with our old, carefully-bred bees from our origins. Successfully acclimatising some of them to these lands would be a very worthwhile investment. If we're friendly enough with the owners of The Largest Small City, we should be able to arrange for an introduction. If not... well, halflings are known for being sneaky, if nothing else."
 B50_blessed_be_our_bees_title:0 "Blessed Be Our Bees"
 B50_blessed_be_our_bees_desc:0 "Our new bees have finally settled down, and we've already begun to see results. However, many of our farmers, having never even seen the Small Country, lack the knowledge to properly care for them. If we were to distribute some apiaries to the most learned members of our clergy, we could finally utilise the insects on a nationwide scale."
 B50_knights_of_black_and_yellow_title:0 "Stinging Lancers"
 B50_knights_of_black_and_yellow_desc:0 "'High in the hive wherein she rests her wings,\nThe Queen is loved by all her underlings.\nHer robes are long, and hide her deadly sting;\nBeware! She has no need for Knight or King.\nBut hold no fear within your halfling heart,\nShe has no wish to pierce you with her dart.\nShe simply wants the plants, with no delay,\nTo grow up strong and seize the Newshire day!'\n\nExcerpt from 'The Honey And The Hives', a children's book by Conrad Kettlebrook."
 transmutation_2_tooltip:0 "Our Ruler must be Renowned in Transmutation."
 B50_a_gentlefolk_title:0 "A Gentlefolk"
 B50_a_gentlefolk_desc:0 "Despite the trials and tribulations our people have faced as we settled in Escann, many have refused to give up their peaceful, cheerful ways. Newshiremen appear broadly content with their lot in life; happy, so long as they have land to farm and food in their bellies. Even the ex-adventurers of the Small Fellows have begun settling down, taking much more mundane and relaxing requests in place of the death-defying feats of glory they used to prefer."
 B50_setting_ourselves_apart_title:0 "Setting Ourselves Apart"
 B50_setting_ourselves_apart_desc:0 "The longer we spend away from the Small Country, the more different our culture becomes. In recent times, we have even begun to refer to ourselves entirely separately to our old halfling loyalties. No longer are we Redfoot, Bluefoot, Visfoot, or Imperial - we are the Newfoot of Newshire! Now, let's see about a nice cup of tea..."
 crimson_deluge_started_tooltip:0 "The §RCrimson Deluge§! has begun."
 affected_by_deluge_tooltip:0 "Province is affected by the §RCrimson Deluge§!."
 crimson_deluge_ended_tooltip:0 "A cure for the §RCrimson Deluge§! has been found."
 B50_born_of_the_blood_title:0 "Born Of The Blood"
 B50_born_of_the_blood_desc:0 "A letter. Carefully penned, despite the chaos."
 B50_made_by_the_blood_title:0 "Made By The Blood"
 B50_made_by_the_blood_desc:0 "A solution. One that must be investigated further."
 B50_undone_by_the_blood_title:0 "Undone By The Blood"
 B50_undone_by_the_blood_desc:0 "A difficulty. Something that comes with consequences."
 newshire_devastation_tooltip:0 "All owned provinces will lose 25 devastation."
 B50_our_eyes_are_yet_to_open_title:0 "Our Eyes Are Yet To Open"
 B50_our_eyes_are_yet_to_open_desc:0 "We have unlocked a door that we should not have opened."
 B50_fill_the_kettles_title:0 "Fill The Kettles"
 B50_fill_the_kettles_desc:0 "Newshire's domestic tea industry has really taken off, and the Newshiremen, along with interested foreigners, are clamouring for more. With a little elbow grease, we can expand our existing efforts; maybe we can even grow some new ones. Steaming pots of Newshire brew will soon fill Halann's kitchens!"
 B50_cultural_exports_title:0 "Cultural Exports"
 B50_cultural_exports_desc:0 "We halflings lack a distinct language of our own, regional dialects notwithstanding. Moving to Escann and developing our own culture hasn't changed that... but, all across polite society, a new method of discussion seems to have taken off..."
 B50_loamy_soil_title:0 "Loamy Soil"
 B50_loamy_soil_desc:0 "It's easy to get caught up on the negatives of these lands, but we halflings are rather used to looking towards the future. Instead of lamenting the harsh wilds, let us ruminate on the fresh, arable soil we now live on. We came here with a vision; before it can be created, we must adapt."
 B50_the_northern_farthing_title:0 "The Northern Farthing"
 B50_the_northern_farthing_desc:0 "Fighting is hardly in the halfling nature... but we need to look away from our old beliefs and ways, if only for a moment. If we fail to grow, to match the rising powers of Escann, then we will die just like the Small Country before us.\n\nWe must not be like them."
 B50_the_eastern_farthing_title:0 "The Eastern Farthing"
 B50_the_eastern_farthing_desc:0 "We have more than a few halfling immigrants in our lands, celebrating our recent conquest of the lands north of our realm. Already, they rush to fill the fertile lands of the people who came before them. Using this as a model, alongside our advancing farming techniques, we can provide for even more immigration into our nation - the woods of Merescker could prove a promising start..."
 B50_the_western_farthing_title:0 "The Western Farthing"
 B50_the_western_farthing_desc:0 "With Dustinwall and Second Turnwell serving as symbols of our growing strength in Escann, our people are brimming with nationalistic zeal! Luckily for them, we have yet to secure the lands to the west..."
 B50_the_southern_farthing_title:0 "The Southern Farthing"
 B50_the_southern_farthing_desc:0 "...and to the south."
 B50_till_the_land_title:0 "Till The Land"
 B50_till_the_land_desc:0 "Our ancestors have left us with many valuable lessons, but one stands above the rest; 'Giveth to Halann, and Halann giveth back.' To this end, we have Four Great Tasks ahead of us.\n\nFirst, we must fertilise and prepare our soil, readying it to receive our verdant blessing."
 B50_cut_the_trees_title:0 "Cut The Trees"
 B50_cut_the_trees_desc:0 "Second, we must face the forests, carving new fields and pastures from the root-cursed earth."
 grain_production_tooltip:0 "Provinces that are not producing valuable trade goods or livestock will now produce grain."
 B50_divert_the_waters_title:0 "Divert The Waters"
 B50_divert_the_waters_desc:0 "Third, we must create new irrigation canals, feeding them into our farmlands to provide fuel for our crops. Water is the blood of Halann, as we know well - let us dig her some new veins."
 B50_break_the_rocks_title:0 "Break The Rocks"
 B50_break_the_rocks_desc:0 "Fourth, we must use our newly-fueled labourers to work the less arable lands of our realm. Thus, the cycle shall continue forever."
 B50_queer_lodgings_title:0 "Queer Lodgings"
 B50_queer_lodgings_desc:0 "Across Newshire, halflings have taken to building their homes into the rolling hills and dales that make up much of the local terrain. Many of these halfling holes are surrounded by beautiful gardens and expansive farms, and since our home is more a collection of countless villages rather than large cities, there's more than enough room to go around. These holes ought to be constructed in our largest population centres, and their design marked down as official government policy!"
 B50_the_first_free_fair_title:0 "The First Free Fair"
 B50_the_first_free_fair_desc:0 "As it stands, Newshire is a loose republic made up of provincial rulers, who have taken to calling themselves 'Stewards'. Though this has worked for a time, if we wish to stand on the same level as the myriad other nations in Halann, we should choose one of these Stewards to serve as a figurehead of our country. Let us gather them at Dustinwall to decide who shall represent us!"
 B50_things_every_halfling_needs_title:0 "Things Every Halfling Needs"
 B50_things_every_halfling_needs_desc:0 "It's hard not to miss the little things from the Small Country - things that we couldn't bring with us. The bright dyes of Viswall. The fine cloth of Newcobble. The rich tobacco of Tipney. That said, we have the land and the resources to import some supplies. Maybe we could bring a taste of our old home to Escann?"
 B50_not_at_home_title:0 "Not At Home"
 B50_not_at_home_desc:0 "Tea is wonderful. Clean coloured silk makes for a rather fetching outfit. A calming puff on a pipe is enough to brighten any bad day. But something is still missing..."
 B50_remembering_smallknight_title:0 "Remembering Smallknight"
 B50_remembering_smallknight_desc:0 "Though we might not be much for adventure, we never stopped venerating those whose great deeds came before us. Of these heroes, none stand quite as short as Dustin Smallknight, who led us to Escann, fought back the Greentide alongside Corin herself, and established the Small Fellows - the predecessor to our grand nation. He may have been small of stature, but we shall build him a monument that is larger than life!"
 B50_why_we_fight_title:0 "Why We Fight"
 B50_why_we_fight_desc:0 "With our monument complete, and with fresh ale in our bellies, we have arrived back at a common issue since our arrival in this region: we are no longer at home, and we must fight harder than any halfling has fought before! Let us strike whilst the iron is hot, and begin massively reorganising our army. We will show all Halann that, under our rainbow, even the shortest halfling can defeat a giant!"
 B50_the_heft_of_the_toolbox_title:0 "The Heft Of The Toolbox"
 B50_the_heft_of_the_toolbox_desc:0 "Our people might not be fighters, but that doesn't mean they aren't strong. Their talents simply lay in different places than the rest of the world.\n\nBesides, a toolbox to the head is as effective a weapon as any..."
 B50_the_cleave_of_the_hoe_title:0 "The Cleave Of The Hoe"
 B50_the_cleave_of_the_hoe_desc:0 "Giveth to Halann, and Halann giveth back."
 B50_the_last_lines_title:0 "The Last Lines"
 B50_the_last_lines_desc:0 "Perhaps the sedentary Newshireman lifestyle might not be such a bad thing. Mind games are awfully popular, especially amongst older halflings, and all are adept at gleaning insights from even the smallest of phrases. It shouldn't be too difficult to train them up, and the top brass of our army would benefit greatly."
 B50_mean_green_fighting_machines_title:0 "The Meaner, The Greener"
 B50_mean_green_fighting_machines_desc:0 "We pushed the orcs back alongside Corin herself, but even now a few communities stubbornly persist in our lands, much like dirt under one's fingernail or jam in one's foot hair. But perhaps they could prove useful after all. If we ask them nicely, we could offer them a home inside the fortified towns of Freetower and Valefort - in return, they would serve in our armies, giving us the extra brawn we sorely need! If they refuse... well, I suppose we're not actually 'asking'."
 newshire_nice_orcs_tooltip:0 "We must not be expelling or purging orcs."
 newshire_orcs_tooltip:0 "We will direct our orcish minorities to the provinces of Valefort and Freetower."
 newshire_modifier_loss_tooltip:0 "We will lose the effects of Handyhalfling Might, Greenhalfling Thumbs, and Gentlehalfling Viciousness."
 B50_fortify_the_reaches_title:0 "Fortify The Reaches"
 B50_fortify_the_reaches_desc:0 "To the southeast and west of our realm lies lands beyond our reach, for now. With a little elbow grease, we could fortify the Newshire Reaches, until such a time we are able to push past them. Any leftover resources can go into fortifications elsewhere - waste not, want not, after all!"
 B50_enshrine_the_farthings_title:0 "Enshrine The Farthings"
 B50_enshrine_the_farthings_desc:0 "Upcreek. The Taran Plains. Adenica. These three historical areas have long served as the core of our growing nation. As time has passed, we have incorporated four more distinct territories into a realm - the Farthings of the North, East, South, and West. Now that we have the administrative ability to do so, we will incorporate the Farthings eternally into our country: Newshire shall forever hold the domains of the northern Godshield!"
 B50_growing_strong_title:0 "Growing Strong"
 B50_growing_strong_desc:0 "A letter. A difficulty. A door we should not have opened.\n\nA solution, beyond our ability to refuse."
 B50_burst_into_bloom_title:0 "Burst Into Bloom"
 B50_burst_into_bloom_desc:0 "We could not stop the Chloromancers. This is, hopefully, not the worst thing in the world. Halann giveth back, after all."
 newshire_headquarters_tooltip:0 "The Chloromancers will establish a grander base of operations, subverting the Mages estate and unlocking a new estate privilege."
 newshire_consequences_tooltip:0 "§g-the door swings wide the hinges are roused-§"
 B50_peas_of_mind_title:0 "Peas Of Mind"
 B50_peas_of_mind_desc:0 "The Chloromancers look to the west - at the legendary Cursewood, known for being a region of intense arcane interest. Currently, it serves as one of the Newshire Reaches; with a few drops of magic, and room to experiment, the Guild believes they can make it something more..."
 B50_uncrackable_nuts_title:0 "Uncrackable Nuts"
 B50_uncrackable_nuts_desc:0 "The protection of our nation is always in the forefront of our minds, and the Chloromancers intend to help us in that endeavour. Now that they have the freedom to experiment, several radical military proposals have reached the table of our First Steward. Some are more practical than others (exploding aubergines? Really?), whilst some... well..."
 B50_the_squashkin_arrive_title:0 "The Squashkin Arrive!"
 B50_the_squashkin_arrive_desc:0 "...accidents happen."
 B50_mobilise_the_pods_title:0 "Mobilise The Pods"
 B50_mobilise_the_pods_desc:0 "Some of the Chloromancers have observed a rather strange phenomenon. It appears that, in specific, replicable circumstances, the previously static peapod defences are able to uproot themselves and travel incredibly quickly. If we were to fully mobilise these plants, we could have an incredibly effective fighting force on our side!"
 B50_increditable_vegetable_title:0 "Increditable Vegetable"
 B50_increditable_vegetable_desc:0 "The Free Fair at Freshcobble, where we choose our leader, continues to be an important tradition amongst the Newshiremen, serving as a fun event where our people can §Rforget§! their troubles. With the addition of absolutely gargantuan fruits and vegetables, grown with a little help from transmutation magic, a novel idea has reached the ears of the First Steward."
 B50_there_and_back_again_title:0 "There And Back Again"
 B50_there_and_back_again_desc:0 "After centuries of oppression, our old homeland has finally broken free! Though our people have no desire to leave Newshire, many can trace their lineage back to the Small Country or have other connections there, and we would be doing them a great disservice if we didn't help in some way. Luckily, we've come into the ownership of some unique resources that may allow them to turn the tide of their war!"
 B50_on_the_offensive_title:0 "On The Offensive"
 B50_on_the_offensive_desc:0 "Once more, Newshire must defend itself! Patriotic fervor has swept through the Newshiremen, and thousands rise to protect their homes and families! This shall be our decisive strike against the tallfolk!"
 newshire_escann_wars_tooltip:0 "The Escanni Wars of Consolidation have begun."
 B50_just_around_the_riverbend_title:0 "Just Around The Riverbend"
 B50_just_around_the_riverbend_desc:0 "Across the Alen, beyond the Northern Farthing, the verdant farmlands of Nortmere and the Lower Nath wait for us to claim them!"
 B50_garden_warfare_title:0 "Garden Warfare"
 B50_garden_warfare_desc:0 "The lands east of Silvermere are inhabited by necromancers, stemming from the old influence of the Order of the Iron Sceptre. Their vile undead armies shall crash against our walls, but will find themselves unable to tear them down before our flourishing plant armies collapse on them!"
 B50_vernhamward_march_title:0 "Vernhamward March"
 B50_vernhamward_march_desc:0 "'The Muster marches through the trees,\nTo claim their rightful prize.\nThe lands of Vernham, fresh and green,\nHide just beyond their eyes.\nTheir guns shall crack! Their foes shall howl!\nThe Muster shall give chase!\nBehind them, wielding wand and trowel,\nThe Chloromancers wait!\nOh! South! Vernhamward on!\nThey'll fight until the day is done!\nOh! South! Vernhamward on!\nThey'll fight until the battle's won!'\n\n'Vernhamward March' by Sergeant Samwise Greenhill."
 B50_a_city_of_dreams_title:0 "A City Of Dreams"
 B50_a_city_of_dreams_desc:0 "All nations born from the fires of the Greentide dream of controlling Castonath, once the greatest city of Halann. Though we don't particularly care for restoring the city to its old lofty heights, the Stewards can surely find some other use for it. After all, we've dreams of our own."
 newshire_scheming_tooltip:0 "§gVoices whisper behind closed doors...§!"
 B50_the_last_free_fair_title:0 "The Last Free Fair"
 B50_the_last_free_fair_desc:0 "§ROnce again, closed doors swing open.§!"
 newshire_won_consolidation_tooltip:0 "Newshire has won the Escanni Wars of Consolidation! §YThere are still more missions to be completed. If you plan to form Castanor or the Black Demesne, remember to complete the Newshire mission tree before activating the decision.§!"
 B50_tear_down_the_walls_title:0 "Tear Down The Walls"
 B50_tear_down_the_walls_desc:0 "Castonath is unlike any other part of Newshire - urbanised, closed off, and covered with stone instead of farmlands.\n\nWe own the city, now. We can change that."
 newshire_castonath_thirteen_tooltip:0 "All Castonath provinces have at least §Y13§! base tax, base production, and base manpower."
 B50_no_longer_dreaming_title:0 "No Longer Dreaming"
 B50_no_longer_dreaming_desc:0 "With the walls gone, it will be much easier to move the resources (and people) of Castonath to other areas of Newshire. We'll leave a skeleton crew of loyal Newshiremen in their place, keeping the city from being completely abandoned. It might be of further use in the future."
 newshire_castonath_nine_tooltip:0 "All Castonath provinces have at least §Y9§! base tax, base production, and base manpower."
 B50_let_the_wild_take_over_title:0 "Let The Wild Take Over"
 B50_let_the_wild_take_over_desc:0 "The Verdancy was born from a failed experiment in Castonath, and, try as we might, we have been unable to destroy the cause of the catastrophe. Even today, the seed in the middle of the city requires constant monitoring, in case of another outbreak. Instead of trying to destroy it... it may be more prudent to contain it within Castonath, and to allow the Chloromancers free access to the area for their experiments."
 B50_step_into_the_sun_title:0 "Step Into The Sun"
 B50_step_into_the_sun_desc:0 "Blood is, in the literal sense, life. Plenty of creatures in Newshire - in particular, those taller than us - have blood to spare.\n\nWe shall see how much life they can offer us."
 B50_the_festival_of_bounty_title:0 "The Festival Of Bounty"
 B50_the_festival_of_bounty_desc:0 "Despite our shift away from the Stewardship of old, the Newshiremen still enjoy celebrating at Freshcobble. It just so happens that, as it turns out, no amount of magic can prevent a marrow from rotting forever."

 B50_seeds_of_stone_title:0 "Seeds Of Stone"
 B50_seeds_of_stone_desc:0 "Escann is, slowly but surely, falling under our complete control. Despite this, terrorist elements remain, plotting against the success of Newshire at every turn. They must be stopped.\n\nIf we were to construct a series of Mage Towers across our new territories, we would be able to use them as eyes - similar to a lighthouse. Being able to see our new subjects would go a long way towards encouraging them to accept our rule."
 B50_spring_eternal_title:0 "Spring Eternal"
 B50_spring_eternal_desc:0 "One of our finest advisors has an interesting proposal - one which could dramatically increase the effectiveness of our current methods of vivomancy.\n\n§gTake care not to give too much.§!"

 # Events
 flavor_newshire.2.t:0 "A Cultivation, Of Sorts"
 flavor_newshire.2.d:0 "Blood is, in the literal sense, life. Osman Kettlebrook, an elderly halfling of one-and-seventy, ponders these words as he works his tobacco pipe. The air is fresh and clean, tainted only by the smoke from his briar. Somewhere beyond his vision, he can hear the muffled laughing of his neighbour's children, just waking up for the day. How nice, he thinks, to be young; to have been born after the wars old halflings like Osman had fought here. How wonderful, to laugh at nothing; to forget the old, rusting ankle-cutters still hanging from the walls of every hurriedly-built home in this corner of Halann. But still, despite his cynicism, he is thankful - for those of his blood continue to walk these lands, free from oppression... for now.\n\nAustin Kettlebrook, a labourer of nine-and-thirty, sits beneath an open window in his home, built directly into the hillside. He carefully slices another sliver of wood from his creation - a toy orc, slowly taking shape, reminiscent of the beasts his father warned him about. The beasts he himself had faced, all in the name of carving out a home in these wild, untamed lands. Of course, the remnants of the Greentide still exist in East Cannor, but even now, sprouts dance across the once-dead land. Truly, the old adage holds firm: Giveth to Halann, and Halann giveth back.\n\nHaree Kettlebrook, a sweet child of barely two-and-ten, sits on the roof of her hill home. The grass is damp and fresh beneath her. Her mother is resting one room over, and her father works on a toy for her in their quaint little kitchen. As for her, she gazes at the horizon as the sun rises overhead. Her parents like to scare her with stories of Escann's dangers... but here, in the peace of morning, she finds it hard to believe them.\n\nIn truth, as the old company gives way for a new nation, only one thing can be certain - this is merely the beginning."
 flavor_newshire.2.a:0 "A new sun dawns over a New Shire!"
 flavor_newshire.3.t:0 "An Unexpected Party"
 flavor_newshire.3.d:0 "'...and so, my dear Conrad, the honey flowed freely in the valley once again, and all the happy halflings never went hungry, spending the rest of their quiet lives with their bellies full and sated.' Haree Kettlebrook, a well-to-do halfling of two-and-fifty, placed the well worn book down, despite the pleas and begs of her grandson.\n\n'One more, please, granny!' He hollered, chin barely peeking out from the thick covers he was wrapped in.\n\n'Perhaps tomorrow, little one. Your grandma has a steaming cup of tea waiting for her before bed; not to mention that growing halflings need all the sleep they can get! How else do you think we get the hair on our feet, hm?' Smiling kindly, she watched as little Conrad Kettlebrook's eyes widened comically, before he leaned over to blow out the candle and burrow himself impossibly deeper into the warm blankets.\n\nIn the kitchen of the little house in the hillside, Haree watched the freshly brewed tea swirl in her cup, frowning thoughtfully. It was ever so expensive to import into Escann, but the small pleasure a mug would bring was unmatched. As she glanced out her window, at the dimming sunlight shining over the half-ploughed fields she'd spent her life caring for, a thought flashed across her mind. The soil wasn't perfect, but she was nothing if not Newfoot through and through. Teasing Halann's bounty from her white-knuckled grip was their specialty.\n\n'My dear,' she called, looking to the doorway where her husband's head appeared, 'do you still keep in touch with those Port Munas fellows? It might be time to try a different crop...'"
 flavor_newshire.3.a:0 "Fresh tea has come to Newshire!"
 flavor_newshire.3.b:0 "We'll just import more instead."
 flavor_newshire.4.t:0 "The Red Days"
 flavor_newshire.4.d:0 "It started with a drop.\n\nWithin days, the Deluge had spread across all of Newshire. As our crops were drowned in blood and gore, the soil withered and died beneath them. Our harvests failed. Our people began to starve, panic, and riot.\n\nOur nation wasn't prepared for this. Was any? Did any need to be as badly as we did, with so many livelihoods dependent on good rains?\n\nPerhaps it was a message. Of course we know of the war over the Court... but maybe we erred somewhere, too.\n\nSome go as far as to whisper even worse... that, maybe, this was how it was supposed to end all along."
 flavor_newshire.4.a:0 "No... There must be a way!"

The organisation was small, but had been very helpful with growing bigger, better crops - at least, they were, until all of the crops died.\n\nAs it happens, all of the plants being dead had caused them a rather lot of trouble.\n\n'My name is Layton Kettlebrook,' the page read, 'Grandmaster of the Chloromancy Guild of Newshire. To be direct; we believe that we have a way to end the Red Days.'\n\nThe explanation was concise, and all the Chloromancers requested was the necessary facilities and freedom to continue their research, should it turn dramatic, difficult, or... controversial."

Layton Kettlebrook, Grandmaster of the Chloromancy Guild of Newshire, scoffed at this assertion,as the fields shifted from green to rust-red.

Can one not bolster the other?\n\nDays passed. Weeks. Months. The Deluge continued to fall.

Across the nation, they are heralded as heroes, cheered into every village they enter. Their potions and magics appear ever more potent, and our crop yields have never been this high.\n\nOne wonders how far they plan to go to unearth Halann's bounty."

Truly, a wondrous celebration of the halfling appetite.\n\nIn an interesting combination of circumstances, our people have opted to hold a similar celebration at Dustinwall, on the same date the Stewards planned to announce their new organisational structure.

 flavor_newshire.13.d:0 "Alder Kettlebrook, a middle-aged halfling of thirty-and-three, was hardly anything special. He rose every morning at the crack of dawn, padding his way to his kitchen to make breakfast for his family. He watered his plants, smoked his pipe, saw his partner to work, and soaked up the morning sun before second breakfast. Some days he would read, either on his little bench by his door or, if it was raining, in his armchair by his favourite window. Occasionally, he would try his hand at authorship, although he knew he would never find the same success as great-grandfather Conrad. Rarely, he'd visit one of his brothers.\n\nThe only remarkable thing about Alder Kettlebrook was his ability to make the perfect pumpkin pie.\n\nIt defied all logic. With just a heap of fresh flour, a sliced gourd, and a few other ingredients he kept to hand, he could create a desert beyond all comprehension. He would get visitors - perhaps three a month - seeking him out for a slice, such was the quality of the dish. And at the Dustinwall Pie Festival (or, as it came to be known, the First Free Fair), the crowd flocked to his table, sniffing out his pastries and devouring them in a matter of minutes.\n\nIt just so happened that, at the First Free Fair, little Belladonna Underhill made a mistake. You see, she was supposed to bring the box of votes for the election to the Stewards, and the box for the Sampling to the judges, but she was awfully distracted by the colours and crowds that she may have... mixed them up.\n\nAlder Kettlebrook was not a Steward. It was rather surprising, then, that Alder Kettlebrook became the First Steward."

All bear the Chloromancer's mark; Cora's adorned with the symbols of the Guildmaster. She smiles tightly - a thorn, hidden amongst a bushel of roses.\n\n'[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName],' she begins, lowering herself into the chair opposite, 'I come with a business opportunity - one which would greatly benefit our darling Shire.'\n\nHer suggestion is simple - an enshrined position in government, protected from the stifling oversight of the Magisterium, in exchange for the continued support of the Chloromancer's Guild. It is not phrased as a suggestion.\n\nEven now, years after the Deluge, the heroism of the Guild is remembered. Their magic is potent, and many a farmer has made her fortune using their elixirs and spells. To refuse them would, implicitly, cost the Stewards their careers.\n\nCora Kettlebrook leaves the office with a declaration in hand.\n\nThe door does not close behind her."

Even now, with the moon hanging overhead, the streets were filled with people going about their business, making a light hum of activity fill the air around them.\n\nIt was unlike anywhere else in Newshire.\n\nInterestingly, Devin Kettlebrook had never liked the quiet. He always worked best with a little background noise. And the buzz of Castonath was giving him plenty to think about.\n\nHow much blood had Newshire spilt, to reach this point? How many lives had been lost? Was this hegemony worth that price? Would even more need to be done, to achieve greatness for the halfling people?\n\nIt was strange. Even here, above the greatest city in all Halann, Devin felt like he had so much further to climb."

Allegedly.\n\nHere's what is known for sure: one day, the castle in Rohiboos stood tall. There was a strange, unseasonal earthquake overnight, and in the morning the fort had completely disappeared.\n\nHere's what may have happened: If, and this is just an example, a fledgling member of the Chloromancers were to, perhaps, accidentally cast a growth spell through a particularly-intense arcane focus, instead of a flavouring spell, then the target plant could grow rather large. Such a plant (a squash, maybe) would most certainly be strong enough to completely destroy the fort, if it were summoned nearby.\n\nI suppose we'll never know.

Command of the military. Control of agrarian reform. Foreign affairs.\n\nWhen was the last time a Steward wasn't a Chloromancer? Fifteen years ago? Thirty? More?\n\nIn the chaos of the Consolidation Wars, nobody even noticed as the barriers between government and mage were fully stripped away - dissolved like sugar in hot water.\n\nAt the Dustinwall Free Fair, there was only one dish presented - a mouthwateringly-delicious pumpkin pie, baked by Devin Kettlebrook, Guildmaster of the Newshire Chloromancers, following a recipe left by some great-great-great-grandfather.\n\nMost didn't even realise his relation.

The Verdancy was behind them - the worst that could happen would be the death of his garden, and the potential payoff was simply too high to turn down. If this worked for him and Micah, it could work for Poppy and Adeline (who faced the very same dilemma), or Erel (who simply preferred his own company, but still fervently hoped for a child), or Brandon and Isabella (who had tried so hard, for so long, but seemed stymied at every turn).\n\nFrom underneath the ground, pushed up on a bed of bright green leaves, a squalling halfling baby emerged."
