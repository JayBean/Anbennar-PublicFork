 melakmengi_nation_title: "The True Successor"
 melakmengi_nation_desc: "In 936, the Empire of Melakmengi came to an end in a violent explosion, killing the dragon Zenidir Zentirizar along with the infamous damestear dragon he fought against. From that day onwards, the land of Madriamilak became divided between hundreds of feuding kings, each seeking to be the true successor to the old empire. Through diplomacy and warfare, we have managed to bring most of Amilak’s domain under our rule, finally proving that we are the true heirs of Melakmengi. It is time we revive the old empire."

 #Aspect Titles
 organize_a_great_prayer: "Organize a Great Prayer"
 desc_organize_a_great_prayer: "Mengi rulers will often call for a call of inner reflection and week-long prayer during political crises. These great prayers will stabilize the realm, but usually lead to a loss of income."
 repel_interlopers: "Repel Interlopers"
 desc_repel_interlopers: "The holy land of Madriamilak is sacred, and in the Sky Domain faith, should only be ruled by Mengi alone. It is rather easy for Mengi kings to gain legitimate claims upon parts of Madriamilak owned by outsiders, with the local populations actively assisting these kings against their foreign rulers."
 construct_a_great_temple: "Construct a Great Temple"
 desc_construct_a_great_temple: "Temples to Amilak are built regularly in Madriamilak. Most can only be considered mere shrines, and the cities may have a temple. Yet only in the most stable of kingdoms will a king decide to build a great temple, attempting to surpass any temple to Amilak built before."
 cleanse_the_sins_of_the_riyitewag: "Cleanse the Sins of the Riyitewag"
 desc_cleanse_the_sins_of_the_riyitewag: "The Riyitewag, or free warriors, are an everpresent source of manpower across Madriamilak. With the support of the priestly class, Mengi kings were able to recruit them to their cause."
 guide_the_rains: "Guide The Rains"
 desc_guide_the_rains: "The role of a rain-priest is of prime importance. Through their spells, Amilak and his divine servants send rain to fall across the land, causing the agricultural provinces to become much more productive for a few years."
 denounce_yrilaks_followers: "Denounce Yrilak's Followers"
 desc_denounce_yrilaks_followers: "The Mengi political scene is chaotic and violent, rivals seeking any advantage against each other. A Mengi king that has a great reputation and the support of the priests will be able to use this clout to their advantage, usually by calling their rival a follower of Yrilak, causing the rival to be reviled across Madriamilak. The rival will then become more open to attack, as none will care about the villainously ruled state's subjugation by a truly righteous Mengi kingdom."

 #events
 sky_domain.1.t: "The Great Prayers"
 sky_domain.1.d: "A week of ritual celebration and prayer, ending with a mighty feast has been called for by the Semayebaka all across our nation. The celebrations will be dedicated to Amilak, offering up excess bounty to be enjoyed in the Heavens and on Halann. The greatest of these rituals will be held - and funded by, our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who shall ascend the highest point in the realm and offer their personal submission to almighty Amilak."
 sky_domain.1.a: "Praise Amilak!"
 
 sky_domain.2.t: "The Outsider Problem"
 sky_domain.2.d: "The loyal and zealous Sky Domain Semayebaka of [sky_domain_repel_interlopers_core_prov.GetName] wail and roil against the authorities of the oppressors, of the injustices brought down upon the heads of Amilak's children and seek one of the Mezhi to rise up and lead them in revolt against the occupiers. A conclave of more down-to-earth priests however have approached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] in a great ceremony, promising to aid them in the conquest of [sky_domain_repel_interlopers_core_prov.GetName] in exchange for driving out their foreign overlords. Whether or not the people of [sky_domain_repel_interlopers_core_prov.GetName] were once our enemies, the sacred duty of protecting the holy land of Amilak cannot be ignored."
 sky_domain.2.a: "Prepare For War!"
 
 sky_domain.3.t: "A Great Endeavor"
 sky_domain.3.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] watches as the priest makes the ceremonial first strike on the ground, as immediately following after come teams of workers and oxen to begin moving the great amount of earth and stone that will be required to create an edifice to Amilak's glory. The main chambers of worship like many temples will be open to the skies, so Amilak may receive prayer and sacrifice unobstructed. Radiating outwards from the heart of the temple will be all sorts of lesser buildings and complexes, including housing for the priests and scribes, houses of healing, and soup kitchens to aid the needy. While humble, it will become a great place of prayer and reverence in the years to come."
 sky_domain.3.a: "May this garner Amilak's favor."

 sky_domain.4.t: "To Bless The Blooded"
 sky_domain.4.d: "The Riyitewag are free soldiers, unbound to a Mezhi; They roam the holy land, seeking gold and glory in the hire of any who pay for their services. From time to time, a particularly influential priest will gather large numbers of them in service of their Mezhi in exchange for an absolution of their many blood-stained sins against their fellow Mengi, accumulated over long lives of war. The High Priest of [Root.GetName] has done so for us, gathering a loyal host of motivated and zealous warriors to meld into our armies as generous examples of Amilak's Mercy."
 sky_domain.4.a: "May these holy warriors be my sword!"

 sky_domain.5.t: "The Miracle Of The Cloud-Priests"
 sky_domain.5.d: "The cloud-priest steps onto the top of the hill, the small cloud of dust drifting in the breeze to join the dozens created by those behind him. The conclave of cloud-priests begin to form a circle on the hill, each raising their staff to the sky as they begin to channel their own power into a great spell. The winds begin to blow, circling the conclave and creating a great windstorm as chants and hymns to Amilak's glory resound for miles, crystal clear despite the distance. After what seems like hours, the winds and hymns die down, only to be replaced by the distant crack of thunder over parched fields and thirsty cattle."
 sky_domain.5.a: "To a full stomach and a fertile future!"

 sky_domain.6.t: "A Weed In The Garden"
 sky_domain.6.d: "The threat of Yrilak, Yezel Mora, and its dark occupants is an ever present threat in the minds of all Mengi. Thus, it should come as no surprise that any and all Mezhi wish to check the threat of the Shadow Swamp, and any who have been turned to its dark service. These Agents of Shadow infested the lands beyond our borders, our Semayebaka divine, going as far as to potentially have bent one of our neighboring enemy rulers to the will of their evil mistresses; the Hags of Yezel Mora. Thusly have the Semayebaka begun to preach a time of war against the Shadow, extolling our ruler to be the sword to burn back the darkness, as Zenidir Zentirizar did so many centuries ago. As is our duty, we must oblige."
 sky_domain.6.a: "Against evil we fight!"
