 #Formable decision
 melakmengi_nation_title: "The True Successor"
 melakmengi_nation_desc: "In 936, the Empire of Melakmengi came to an end in a violent explosion, killing the dragon Zenidir Zentirizar along with the infamous damestear dragon he fought against. From that day onwards, the land of Madriamilak became divided between hundreds of feuding kings, each seeking to be the true successor to the old empire. Through diplomacy and warfare, we have managed to bring most of Amilak’s domain under our rule, finally proving that we are the true heirs of Melakmengi. It is time we revive the old empire."

 #Aspects
 organize_a_great_prayer: "Organize a Great Prayer"
 desc_organize_a_great_prayer: "Mengi rulers will often call for a week-long period of inner reflection and prayer during political crises. These great prayers will help stabilize the realm, as people put down their tools and shutter their shops, coming together to reaffirm bonds of community."
 repel_interlopers: "Repel Interlopers"
 desc_repel_interlopers: "The holy land of Madriamilak is sacred, and in the Sky Domain faith should only be ruled by Mengi alone. It is rather easy for Mengi kings to gain legitimate claims upon parts of Madriamilak owned by outsiders, with the local populations actively assisting these reclaimer kings against their foreign rulers."
 construct_a_great_temple: "Construct a Great Temple"
 desc_construct_a_great_temple: "Temples to Amilak are built regularly in Madriamilak. Most can only be considered mere shrines, whereas cities may have a temple. Yet only in the most stable of kingdoms will a king decide to build a great temple complex, attempting to surpass any temple to Amilak built before."
 cleanse_the_sins_of_the_riyitewag: "Cleanse the Sins of the Riyitewag"
 desc_cleanse_the_sins_of_the_riyitewag: "The Riyitewag or ‘free warriors’ are an ever-present source of manpower across Madriamilak. With the support of the priestly class, Mengi kings are able to recruit these men to their cause."
 guide_the_rains: "Guide The Rains"
 desc_guide_the_rains: "The role of a rain-priest is of prime importance. Through their spells, Amilak and his divine servants send rain to fall across the land, bringing great harvests to our fields for many seasons to come."
 denounce_yrilaks_followers: "Denounce Yrilak's Followers"
 desc_denounce_yrilaks_followers: "The Mengi political scene is chaotic and violent, rivals seeking any advantage against each other. A Mengi king that has a great reputation and the support of the priests will be able to use this clout to their advantage, usually by calling their rival a follower of Yrilak, causing the rival to be reviled across Madriamilak. The rival will then become more open to attack, as none will care about the villainously-ruled state's subjugation by a truly righteous Mengi kingdom."
 expand_the_holy_realm: "Expand The Holy Realm"
 desc_expand_the_holy_realm: "The Second Melakmengi Empire was different from the first in two respects - it petitioned a more centralized version of the Sky Domain faith, and was militantly seeking to expand its borders for purposes of conquest and conversion, seeking to conquer and assimilate the peoples on their borders and their gods. As such, it would become policy for the Mezhi’Mezhi to seek endorsement of the clergy to support their actions by declaring a war holy, in order to further support."
 enforce_amilaks_supremacy: "Enforce Amilak's Supremacy"
 desc_enforce_amilaks_supremacy: "With the foundation of the Second Melakmengi Empire, the nature of the Sky Domain shifted from that of benevolent governance to feverous religious expansion. The church and state became even further intertwined, doing whatever it could to expand the lists of the faithful in newly conquered territories, from integrating gods and spiritual beliefs to mass ritual conversions, where entire towns would be inducted into the embrace of Amilak, by force if deemed absolutely necessary."

 #events
 sky_domain.1.t: "The Great Prayers"
 sky_domain.1.d: "A week of ritual celebration and prayer, ending with a mighty feast has been called for by the Semayebaka all across our nation. The celebrations will be dedicated to Amilak, offering up excess bounty to be enjoyed in the Heavens and on Halann. The greatest of these rituals will be held and funded by our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who shall ascend the highest point in the realm and offer their personal submission to almighty Amilak."
 sky_domain.1.a: "Praise Amilak!"
 
 sky_domain.2.t: "The Outsider Problem"
 sky_domain.2.d: "The loyal and zealous Sky Domain Semayebaka of [sky_domain_repel_interlopers_core_prov.GetName] wail and roil against the authorities of their oppressors, of the injustices brought down upon the heads of Amilak's children. They seek one of the Mezhi to rise up and lead them in revolt against the occupiers. A conclave of more down-to-earth priests, however, have approached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] in a great ceremony, promising to aid them in the conquest of [sky_domain_repel_interlopers_core_prov.GetName] in exchange for driving out their foreign overlords. Whether or not the people of [sky_domain_repel_interlopers_core_prov.GetName] were once our enemies, the sacred duty of protecting the holy land of Amilak cannot be ignored."
 sky_domain.2.a: "Prepare For War!"
 
 sky_domain.3.t: "A Great Endeavor"
 sky_domain.3.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] watches as the priest makes the ceremonial first strike on the ground; immediately after come teams of workers and oxen to begin moving the great amount of earth and stone that will be required to create an edifice to Amilak's glory. The main chambers of worship, like many temples, will be open to the skies, so Amilak may receive prayer and sacrifice unobstructed. Radiating outwards from the heart of the temple will be all sorts of lesser buildings and complexes, including housing for the priests and scribes, houses of healing, and soup kitchens to aid the needy. While humble, it will become a great place of prayer and reverence in the years to come."
 sky_domain.3.a: "May this garner Amilak's favor."

 sky_domain.4.t: "To Bless The Blooded"
 sky_domain.4.d: "The Riyitewag are free soldiers, unbound to a Mezhi; They roam the holy land, seeking gold and glory in the hire of any who pay for their services. From time to time, a particularly influential priest will gather large numbers of them in service of their Mezhi in exchange for an absolution of their many blood-stained sins against their fellow Mengi, accumulated over long lives of war. The High Priest of [Root.GetName] has done so for us, gathering a loyal host of motivated and zealous warriors to meld into our armies as generous examples of Amilak's Mercy."
 sky_domain.4.a: "May these holy warriors be my sword!"

 sky_domain.5.t: "The Miracle Of The Rain-Priests"
 sky_domain.5.d: "The rain-priest steps onto the top of the hill, the small cloud of dust drifting in the breeze to join the dozens created by those behind him. The conclave of rain-priests begin to form a circle on the hill, each raising their staff to the sky as they begin to channel their own power into a great spell. The winds begin to blow, circling the conclave and creating a great windstorm as chants and hymns to Amilak's glory resound for miles, crystal clear despite the distance. After what seems like hours, the winds and hymns die down, only to be replaced by the distant crack of thunder over parched fields and thirsty cattle."
 sky_domain.5.a: "To a full stomach and a fertile future!"

 sky_domain.6.t: "A Weed In The Garden"
 sky_domain.6.d: "The threat of Yrilak, Yezel Mora, and its dark occupants is an ever-present threat in the minds of all Mengi. Thus, it should come as no surprise that all Mezhi wish to check the threat of the Shadowswamp, and any who have been turned to its dark service. These Agents of Shadow infested the lands beyond our borders, our Semayebaka divine, going as far as to bend the ear of one of our neighboring enemy rulers to the will of their evil mistresses, the Hags of Yezel Mora. Thusly have the Semayebaka begun to preach a time of war against the Shadow, extolling our ruler to be the sword to burn back the darkness, as Zenidir Zentirizar did so many centuries ago. As is our duty, we must oblige."
 sky_domain.6.a: "Against evil we fight!"

 sky_domain.7.t: "Divine War"
 sky_domain.7.d: "The firebrand Semayebaka reached his arms to the sky in front of the crowd, his priestly robes spattered with dust and mud of the road. But his eyes, his eyes contained the passion and rage of a divine legion as he stood on a chicken crate, arms stretched.\n\n"I have seen the impiety of our enemies! I have seen the horrors that lay beyond our borders. Men who lay with beasts! Demon-summoning devils from the deserts! Strange Nagide who bring their foreign ways, seeking to bribe them into enslaving our men and abduct our women for their foreign tastes!"\n\nThe crowd gasped and roared in rage.\n\n"The peoples of [sky_domain_expand_holy_realm_tag_target.GetName] are Yrilak's kith and kin! They must be brought to heel! Their souls saved by Amilak's grace and our Mezhi'Mezhi's steel! Go! Spread the truth! Our Mezhi'mezhi must see the truth!"\n\nWhen the priest lets his arms fall, the apparent sound of a distant rumble of thunder echoes agreement. [sky_domain_expand_holy_realm_tag_target.GetName] must burn."
 sky_domain.7.a: "March thy faithful!"

 sky_domain.8.t: "By The Sword"
 sky_domain.8.d: "Armed soldiers move through another village in [sky_domain_enforce_amilaks_supremacy_prov_target.GetName], dragging all but the bedridden elderly from their homes under a cloudy, almost stormy sky. Those who resist meet the spear and sword, whilst the remainder are brought to the village circle, where a congregation of priests are chanting while a team of slaves has begun dismantling the local shrine dedicated to [sky_domain_enforce_amilaks_supremacy_prov_target.Religion.GetName]. The head priest watches, a sense of guilt mixed with a sense of duty. He knows that he does this to save the souls of all those he can, but the mixed loathing and fear in the eyes of so many still drill into his soul. All he can hope for, as the ritual his comrades finalize where the the heavens begin to pour as he initates the crowd into Amilak's graces, is His acknowledgement that he did what was right, what was necessary."
 sky_domain.8.a: "To save one's soul..."
