 #events
 sky_domain.1.t: "The Great Prayers"
 sky_domain.1.d: "A week of ritual celebration and prayer, ending with a mighty feast has been called for by the Semayebaka all across our nation. The celebrations will be dedicated to Amilak, offering up excess bounty to be enjoyed in the Heavens and on Halann. The greatest of these rituals will be held - and funded by, our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who shall ascend the highest point in the realm and offer their personal submission to almighty Amilak."
 sky_domain.1.a: "Praise Amilak!"
 
 sky_domain.2.t: "The Outsider Problem"
 sky_domain.2.d: "The loyal and zealous Sky Domain Semayebaka of [sky_domain_repel_interlopers_core_prov.GetName] wail and roil against the authorities of the oppressors, of the injustices brought down upon the heads of Amilak's children and seek one of the Mezhi to rise up and lead them in revolt against the occupiers. A conclave of more down-to-earth priests however have approached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] in a great ceremony, promising to aid them in the conquest of [sky_domain_repel_interlopers_core_prov.GetName] in exchange for driving out their foreign overlords. Whether or not the people of [sky_domain_repel_interlopers_core_prov.GetName] were once our enemies, the sacred duty of protecting the holy land of Amilak cannot be ignored."
 sky_domain.2.a: "Prepare For War!"
 
 sky_domain.3.t: "A Great Endeavor"
 sky_domain.3.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] watches as the priest makes the ceremonial first strike on the ground, as immediately following after come teams of workers and oxen to begin moving the great amount of earth and stone that will be required to create an edifice to Amilak's glory. The main chambers of worship like many temples will be open to the skies, so Amilak may receive prayer and sacrifice unobstructed. Radiating outwards from the heart of the temple will be all sorts of lesser buildings and complexes, including housing for the priests and scribes, houses of healing, and soup kitchens to aid the needy. While humble, it will become a great place of prayer and reverence in the years to come."
 sky_domain.3.a: "May this garner Amilak's favor."

 sky_domain.4.t: "To Bless The Blooded"
 sky_domain.4.d: "The Riyitewag are free soldiers, unbound to a Mezhi; They roam the holy land, seeking gold and glory in the hire of any who pay for their services. From time to time, a particularly influential priest will gather large numbers of them in service of their Mezhi in exchange for an absolution of their many blood-stained sins against their fellow Mengi, accumulated over long lives of war. The High Priest of [Root.GetName] has done so for us, gathering a loyal host of motivated and zealous warriors to meld into our armies as generous examples of Amilak's Mercy."
 sky_domain.4.a: "May these holy warriors be my sword!"

 sky_domain.5.t: "The Miracle Of The Cloud-Priests"
 sky_domain.5.d: "The cloud-priest steps onto the top of the hill, the small cloud of dust drifting in the breeze to join the dozens created by those behind him. The conclave of cloud-priests begin to form a circle on the hill, each raising their staff to the sky as they begin to channel their own power into a great spell. The winds begin to blow, circling the conclave and creating a great windstorm as chants and hymns to Amilak's glory resound for miles, crystal clear despite the distance. After what seems like hours, the winds and hymns die down, only to be replaced by the distant crack of thunder over parched fields and thirsty cattle."
 sky_domain.5.a: "To a full stomach and a fertile future!"

 sky_domain.6.t: "A Weed In The Garden"
 sky_domain.6.d: "The threat of Yrilak, Yezel Mora, and its dark occupants is an ever present threat in the minds of all Mengi. Thus, it should come as no surprise that any and all Mezhi wish to check the threat of the Shadowswamp, and any who have been turned to its dark service. These Agents of Shadow infested the lands beyond our borders, our Semayebaka divine, going as far as to potentially have bent one of our neighboring enemy rulers to the will of their evil mistresses; the Hags of Yezel Mora. Thusly have the Semayebaka begun to preach a time of war against the Shadow, extolling our ruler to be the sword to burn back the darkness, as Zenidir Zentirizar did so many centuries ago. As is our duty, we must oblige."
 sky_domain.6.a: "Against evil we fight!"
