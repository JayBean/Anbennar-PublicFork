 G62_pirate_talk_title:0 "Pirate Talk"
 G62_pirate_talk_desc:0 "Our port is lost, reduced to a hub for pirates to gather. Townsfolk cower helplessly as the pirates enrich themselves by stealing from the Andic Trade, and we have neither forces nor funds sufficient to expel them. Then again, the pirates haven’t harmed the civilians or raided the village itself, and they make more money than mere wood could ever bring us.\n\nMaybe… maybe we can negotiate."
 G62_andic_navy_title:0 "Andic Navy"
 G62_andic_navy_desc:0 "Our deal has brought great benefits. Amgremos prospers as her former occupants loot ship after ship.\n\nUnfortunately, while the negotiations were successful, our new allies are still pirates. The more of them there are, the more they raid, occasionally even hitting friendly forces. Apologies and reparation notwithstanding, they must be controlled.\n\nWe must hoist the black flag ourselves to be efficient and profit without losing ships on a daily basis."
 G62_clash_of_seas_title:0 "Clash Of Seas"
 G62_clash_of_seas_desc:0 "The nightmare of war is very different from the short raids and sacks familiar to pirates, and the crews are nervous as the Anisikheian ships draw ever closer. Admiral Amarien Bonná stands on the quarter deck and screams to her crew.\n\n'It is us they fear, mateys! Summon the courage that drove you to conquer the seas, and taste the freedom they would take from you! Today we fight, so tomorrow we can sack their palaces, hang those who hung us, and tear down their damned tyrants' statues!\n\nHoist the colors! To hell and back with gold!'"
 G62_great_pirate_empire_title:0 "Great Pirate Empire"
 G62_great_pirate_empire_desc:0 "Amgremós has been transformed from a backwater port dominated by pirates, to the home of a grand corsair fleet.\n\nAll in our reach, from hamlet to cities, have been plundered mercilessly. The pirates have grown from a ramshackle flotilla to a glorious armada of pirates, golden ships decorated with the finest silk, with each clan’s banner waving just below the great purple ensign of the first independent nekheis. Anisikheion has fallen, and Amgremós rules the Cleaved Sea. Just as a shark follows blood, we seek gold.\n\nBe careful in what waters you tread.\n\nYou just might get bit."
 G62_wood_for_everyone_title:0 "Wood For Everyone"
 G62_wood_for_everyone_desc:0 "Amgremos’ terrain is rough, ragged, and not suited for large-scale farming. The trees of Amgremos, however, are large and durable to withstand the harsh environment, and provide the Amgremosi a reliable source of building materials. Amgremos was built on the wood from these forests, but the grain from our overlord has stopped coming, and wood alone will not fill our bellies. Finding a market for this wood though could!"
 G62_silk_market_title:0 "Silk Market"
 G62_silk_market_desc:0 "The demand for silk grows with the city, week after week. Fortunately, so too grow the mulberry orchards. The youths that brought the silk to us are now landed Amgremosi gentry carrying the Kimabhen sericulture tradition, but if we want to expand this industry beyond decentralized village orchards, we should alot them more land and promote more commoners to work for and learn from them.\n\nGoods are worthless without markets, and if we are to compete with our cousins in Kimanis, we must create the infrastructure of a true empire of silk, complete with enough sailors, ports, and warehouses to grow the trade to new heights."
 G62_surf_wax_amgremos_title:0 "Surf Wax Amgremos"
 G62_surf_wax_amgremos_desc:0 "Surfing is a common pass-time of many Amgremósi, thanks to the rough waves of the southern Andic Reach. The sport is not an easy one, requiring great understanding of the water, and control of the board.\n\nSimilarly, a captain must know the waves he rides with, and a strong hand over his ship, lest he fall asunder. Thus, let us make sure we don’t lose control."
 G62_silk_ships_spinneys_title:0 "Silk, Ships and Spinneys"
 G62_silk_ships_spinneys_desc:0 "Strong wood, great ships, and merchants sailing the ocean in the name of Amgremos. \n\nWith this great fleet, the port of Amgremós has been restored, with trade now overflowing the city. Wealth and prosperity not seen since the fall of Kimanis, that could bring a tear to the most proud of the Amgremósi. \n\nIt is now time to cement the privateer fleet into the history of the Kheionai."
 G62_a_new_beginning_title:0 "A New Beginning"
 G62_a_new_beginning_desc:0 "The nekheís were always reliant on their colonial overlords. Being small city states with the threat of constant attacks from the Bashobhar peoples, they survived largely due to the food and armies supplied.\n\nAmgremos is no exception. Our poor soil meant our next meal came only thanks to our mother city Kimanis. Once they fell to Degakheion and Oktikheion though… the food halted, and Amgremos faltered. With no lifeline, the city has fallen into disrepair, and the once lively port fell into sadness.\n\nNow though, it's time to bring ourselves back from the brink."
 G62_searching_for_scraps_title:0 "Searching For Scraps"
 G62_searching_for_scraps_desc:0 "People are well aware of our relations with pirates. They believe that we are pirates ourselves, a scoundrel navy searching for bleeding waters only to get killed by a bigger fish. Unfortunately for our nearby neighbors, piracy doesn’t just mean the ocean. We can steal on the land as well!Apihoxi, our neighbors, flaunt their grain at our hungry bellies. Without proper farms, we \n\nstruggle to maintain our population. They on the other hand have miles of beautiful farmland, producing tons of grain each year. They believe themselves safe under the wise men of Lokemeion.. The pirates of Amgremós are itching to say otherwise…"
 G62_war_for_grain_title:0 "War For Grain"
 G62_war_for_grain_desc:0 "Although we have managed to expand our grain supply, we risk hunger in winter. Yet, wee can’t afford another raid. Not when Apihoxi and their overlords in Ormam have begun militarization along the border.\n\nA raid simply won’t do. What we need is a full out war. The Apihoxi forces are weaker than us, and the Ormami will take too long to cross the sea. Once they arrive, they’ll be too late.\n\nIt's time to make sure we never go hungry again."
 G62_staking_our_claim_title:0 "Staking Our Claim"
 G62_staking_our_claim_desc:0 "Ever since we have taken Apihoxi from Ormam, the Kheionai have begun to reconsider us. They realize we are no longer an orphaned, dying colony. As a result, they blockade our trade and are deliberately trying to debilitate our nation, acting as if they still hold all of the Devand with a tight grip.\n\nThe truth is that their strength is waning. Their ability to secure control of the nekheis weakens with each captured ship, and each port blockaded. They cannot keep something they cannot reach, and each day the Devand drifts further away.\n\nIt's time we take a stand for ourselves."
 G62_free_flame_title:0 "Free Flame"
 G62_free_flame_desc:0 "Amgremós freedom shines amongst the nekheis like a burning flame.\n\nSurrounding us lies their cousins, shrouded in darkness by their overlords, never to see the truth of freedom. Why should our cousins be restrained by weak rulers who do not understand the life of the Devandi nekheis?\n\nThe flame has already been lit, so before it can be put out, let us light the rest of the Devand ablaze."
 G62_the_great_labors_title:0 "The Great Labors"
 G62_the_great_labors_desc:0 "Self sufficiency was something Amgremos has strived for. Devoted ourselves to the cause of strengthening our nation against a constant tide of disaster and failure. But our own success is not enough. Not when the rest of our brethren languish, slavishly dependent on the Kheionai.\n\nTo the men, women, and children of Apihoixi! Eneion! Keyolion! Empkeios! Stand united, for today we rise as high as the heavens themselves!"
 G62_freeing_deyeion_title:0 "Freeing Deyeion"
 G62_freeing_deyeion_desc:0 "Deyeion, a prison colony to Degakheion, and a brother to Amgremos. Despite stemming from different colonizers, we’ve always had a strong relationship thanks to our shared isolation and struggles. Even when our overlords came to clash, we remained stalwart to our friendship, only ever halfheartedly opposing each other.\n\nNow though, as Degakheion seeks to rein in their colonies, Deyeion draws closer to simply becoming another province in Degakheion. If we are to save our brother from the depths, we must take up our arms against the Dega, and liberate them from the tyrants in Alecand!"
 G62_finding_peace_title:0 "Finding Peace"
 G62_finding_peace_desc:0 "Peace does not come easy.\n\nDespite our liberation of Deyeion from Degakheion there are many in Deyeion who remain loyal to their former overlords, in particular the families of respected nobles sent to govern the colony in the name of the Dega himself. These powerful families hold control over much of Deyeion, and certainly have the power to be a thorn in our sides…\n\nTo avoid any mishaps, we must deal with them. Of course, it's best not to come off as marauders slaughtering opposition, despite what a few pirates have suggested. Surely we can find a diplomatic solution to this issue instead?"
 G62_preparing_a_mission_title:0 "Preparing A Mission"
 G62_preparing_a_mission_desc:0 "Ameion is the most remote settlement of the Kheionai. Focusing more on their conquests in the Taychend, they claim to hold an empire that would make even the kheions fearful of their power. In recent times though, stagnation has plagued the once bountiful lands of Ameion.\n\nAs brothers, it is our honorable duty to assist the men of the Andic Reach in any way possible. It is time for us to certify our duty to the nekheis of the east, and to send an envoy to Ameion. With gifts and treasures, we may be able to convince the prideful to submit in unity."
 G62_gathering_army_title:0 "Gathering An Army"
 G62_gathering_army_desc:0 "We need an army.\n\nIt is the simplest concept of any state, something that everyone should know. Yet, our army was practically defunct after we gained independence. It could barely serve as a city guard.\n\nEnough! If we are to make ourselves known, a strong military force is required. One to match the other nekheis and perhaps even the Kheionai!"
 G62_uniting_mteibhar_title:0 "Uniting The Mteibhar"
 G62_uniting_mteibhar_desc:0 "The Mteibhar are a welcoming people, allowing kheionai merchants to enter their lands, sell goods, and share ideas. To Amgremos, they are great friends, for they have given us a tie to trade and goods when we needed them most. Now, facing the threat of invasion, the Mteibhar is placed in a difficult position. Forced to balance the lines of submission and independence, their position in the future of the Devand is unknown.\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, with encroaching armies from Alecand, the Mteibhar may be willing to discuss closer ties to our own nation. Better to be with an ally than an enemy, so let us gather the envoys to have a talk with their king!"
 G62_andic_union_title:0 "Andic Union"
 G62_andic_union_desc:0 "While the nekheis were always distant from their overlords in Alecand, each had their own business to take care of, and their own worries to bother with. In these tumultuous times though, what was once simply a thought has turned into reality, with Amgremós at its head. Through diplomacy and conquest, the smallest of the three ended up ruling them all.\n\nThe Echate League was never an idea set in stone, simply a figment of the imagination to many. Yet here we are. Fantasy is finally becoming reality. Let us proclaim the Echate League, and with it, the prosperity of the Andic Reach."

 G62_events.1.t:0 "Pirate Talk"
 G62_events.1.d:0 "It has been decided that the pirates and Amgremósi shall forge an alliance, one that will be mutually beneficial to all parties.\n\nFor the pirates, they will be allowed to dock at Amgremósi Ports as they please. They will be allowed to loot the seas without the Amgremósi interfering, for a cut of the profit. They will also be allowed representation in elections and will be allowed to run for presidency as long as they follow the law.\n\nFor the nation of Amgremós, along with receiving the aforementioned cut of profits from recorded, they will also be indebted to support local piracy as to make sure the pirate coalition does not collapse. They will serve as an intermediary between many rival pirates in hope that by putting down their arms and severing their grudges, that everyone may benefit.\n\nWith the signing of this paper, Amgremos shall enter a symbiotic relationship with the newly forged pirate coalition. Both shall prosper, whether under a purple or black flag.\n\nIf the deal is ever to be broken, then the pirates are entitled to raid and loot the town of Amgremos as compensation."
 G62_events.1.a:0 "Deal."
 G62_events.2.t:0 "The Refugees"
 G62_events.2.d:0 "Rowing from the shores of Kimanis they come,\nFleeing from what all the tyrants have done.\nRow, row! Here they come,\nBack to the land of the free.\nRow, row! Here they come,\nFrom tyrants they are to flee.\nThe name of the Dega is in utter shame,\nAnd the men of Okti are crying in bed,\nNo fit rulers in sight, for now…\nThus the Kimani peoples are leaving\nFor the bastion of freedom, Amgremós!\nRow, row! Here they come,\nBack to the land of the free.\nRow, row! Here they come,\nFrom tyrants they are to flee."\n\nA Kimani/Amgremósi sea shanty."
 G62_events.2.a:0 "Welcome"
 G62_events.3.t:0 "Vandals Of The Ocean"
 G62_events.3.d:0 "From the shipwrights to the open sea, our official navy finally made its presence clear through swift logistics, managing and guiding the pirates to their targets and routes. A system so efficient and well organized that it was too notorious mainly to the Anisikheian navy.\n\nSmall isolated reports soon became too many alarms at once to the ears of our admirals. Haven's set to fire in our hegemony, captains captured and hanged along with all their crews, loot that is not reaching our ports and Anisikheion's flag waving from flagships as they impose their laws on our business.\n\nBut as great sailors once said "Where others see obstacles, you must see opportunities" We see the possibility to finally assert our sovereignty in the seas.\n\nOne of our greatest surviving pirates sees this opportunity too and its profit, captain Amarien "Death Gripper" Bonná has a pirate fleet of thick numbers ready to sail and fight alongside our admirals.\n\nIt is time to teach the Anisikheian crown their place."
 G62_events.3.a:0 "To war!"
 G62_events.4.t:0 "Subjugation Of The Isles"
 G62_events.4.d:0 "Anisikheion has fallen, the last true blockade from our piracy has been sunken in glorious battle, and now is a new safe haven for our pirates. There is now no fleet able to stop our combined forces.\n\nWhat does this mean for us, exactly?\n\nWell gentlemen… If our navy is the largest, and nobody can compete with it, then what is an honest pirate bound to do to enemy coastal settlements?\n\nAs punishment for years of attacks on our fleets and armies, and the raids upon our settlements even before our independence. As revenge for constant attempts at annexation, like we were simply an extension of our overlords in Kimanis…"
 G62_events.4.a:0 "Its raiding time!"
 G62_events.5.t:0 "Opening A Lumber Yard"
 G62_events.5.d:0 "Amgremos has a large amount of forests and trees. While they do disable us from continuing further development of farmlands without having to deal with cruddy soil and expending what little money we have on cutting down trees, they do have upsides. We can sell the wood to the other nekheis for construction materials, and use it ourselves for practically no cost. One thing has also recently come up that could play a major factor: shipbuilding. Pirates of course love ships, but some of them are outdated or rotting away and desperately need repairs or are willing to buy completely new ships. Unfortunately for us, we couldn’t handle all three of these needs at once! We needed an organized way to sell our wood.\n\nThus, we would like to introduce you to the largest lumber yard in all of the Kheionai lands!"
 G62_events.5.a:0 "Perfect!"
 G62_events.6.t:0 "Sponsored Stores"
 G62_events.6.d:0 "Silk smuggles sees surplus success.\n\nA simple catchphrase for all pirates to remember. As we smuggle silk into the country, we also manage to steal a good amount of silk worms and skilled silk stewards who would rather hold loyalty to us than to cruel overlords. Funding these silk stewards is important to foster a large silk market like the ones in Kimanis. If we were to just steal silk, eventually they will notice and react. By bringing their workers to Amgremós, they will suffer a loss of skilled craftsmen, and their production will be damaged.\n\nSo for now, money will be devoted to these stores to make sure they succeed. We’ve already seen an inspiring amount of silk vendors have great success under our careful eye. Stores like Gólfos Wágnos producing stylish togas for the rich, and Odídas making cheap clothing and carpets for the masses. They all bring in plenty of profits for the state, and have allowed our dull city streets to be replaced with silk banners and designs all around. Some refugees from Kimanis say it reminds them of home."
 G62_events.6.a:0 "Look at this toga, tell me he's broke!"
 G62_events.7.t:0 "Kheion Armada"
 G62_events.7.d:0 ""Another 10 ships lost! This cannot be allowed to continue! They are bleeding us dry!"-Nauarch Elethoas Kelyphos can barely contain its anger.\n\nWhile in the beginning the kheions had largely ignored the alliance between our city and the local pirates as the strength of our alliance grew it became harder and harder for them to ignore. Under pressure from their richest merchants and ship owners the cities have set aside their differences and started working together to contain the rampant piracy within the Cleaved Sea. The leading admiral Kelodus Karcharias has employed a simple, but effective method. Destroy any ship not flying the colours of one of the kheions and particularly those that fly our colours. As a result, both our legal and illegal business has taken quite a lot of damage.\n\nWe must strike back before these brutal methods fully strangle our trade. By taking control of the isles dotted throughout the Cleaved Sea we can create a series of secure resting points for our fleets, well protected from the likes of Karcharias and his thugs."
 G62_events.7.a:0 "Let us begin!"
 G62_events.8.t:0 "Smuggling Silk"
 G62_events.8.d:0 "Those Oktibhen barbarians may control our old Kimanis and its sericulture industry, but they still have zero taste when it comes to style, especially in silk fashion. At most they can make decent handkerchiefs and tablecloths.\n\nHow can we satisfy the need of dressing in those smooth, soft, finely decorated garments of old times without spending hundreds in imports? The pirates have taken note of this.They have employed young immigrant relatives from Kimabhen silk farmers. A couple of family visits have been a good facade for some good wholesale silk \n\nsmuggling. The amount they brought has been enough for some pirates and smugglers to buy Amgremosi land and retire in farming villas... They brought some tree sprouts with them and at night a good couple of silkmoths can be seen seeking light in our ports."
 G62_events.8.a:0 "Anyways, do you like my toga?"
 G62_events.9.t:0 "The Raid"
 G62_events.9.d:0 "A young man begins to tell a tale…\n\nA silent night. The villagers lay asleep, and the Apihoxi guard stands tired at watching the endless night.\n"Hey Jim"\n"Yeah"\n"You see those bushes over there?"\n"Yeah"\n"I think they may be fake."\n"Maybe. Shoot an arrow at it."\n"Wouldn’t they shoot back?"\n"They would have done that a while ago."\n\nAs Jim goes to turn around, he sees his friend lying dead on the floor with an arrowhead directly in his skull.\n\nJim turns back around to scream for help, but he is silenced as well.\n\nThe pirates laugh at the young man’s tale. The raid was a grand, GRAND success. The rush of pirates that ran and looted the ganaries was immense. Thousands of pounds of bread and grain that we may use to sustain ourselves! We can finally maintain our people, and possibly expand our farms to be somewhat self-sustaining with all of the seeds we collected.. Unfortunately for Apihoxi, they will have to remain without food this winter.\n\nThey should have just shared from the start."
 G62_events.9.a:0 "Good story Kachilas!"
 G62_events.10.t:0 "The Great Odyssey"
 G62_events.10.d:0 "The leaders have shared a common premonition, one not without truth. The Kheionai in Alecand prepare to march upon our nation, for we have upset the balance in the region. They cannot comprehend a nekheis working towards equal grounds, much less surpassing them.\n\nThus, they have armed their colonies to the teeth, and have stationed their own armies to keep a tight grasp upon their colonies. \n\nIt seems that to truly prove ourselves, we will have to bear the weight of the rest of the nekheis upon our shoulders. What we have already accomplished may have already certified our position amongst the many in Alecand, but to truly show these foolish imperialists that we are to be taken seriously, we must pry their prized possessions, their nekheis, one by one. \n\nThen, and only then, will we see ourselves rise above the rest."
 G62_events.10.a:0 "Time to prove ourselves."
 G62_events.11.t:0 "Promethean Accomplishments"
 G62_events.11.d:0 "Our sailors land in our docks after a busy day, once again the people cheer for them as they unload their big wooden chests from their ships, that as any pirate knows, are the closest thing to a pirate’s heart: A row of merchants are lined across the harbor ready to be the first to place their bids on the stolen goods, each of them more eager than the last. \n\nItems such as silverware from the Taychend to ancient relics from Alecand are unloaded and sold on mass, suddenly one of the sailors unveils a book the keen eyed would know all too well, a second hand copy of the rights of the colonies by one of Prómetus’s followers, truly a marvel to find at this day and age as these books became rare after the decree from the mainland. Perhaps, here, this book will finally find its place as a core part of our society and guide us to a future in which we are truly free."
 G62_events.11.a:0 "He would love what we have done."
 G62_events.12.t:0 "United Nekheis"
 G62_events.12.d:0 "It was a wild berry, cherry and orange scented spring morning. The aromatic resins burnt at the central fire of the Agora gave it some wooden and floral notes. Our ruler was by it, burning some laurel leaves as the rest of the representatives were arriving. Once everyone was in places he unfolded a cloud-white scroll in front of the noblemen, merchants, admirals, commoners and servants.\n\n"As of today, these nine principles will start ruling in all of the Republic of Ammgremos, its sisters Nekheis and their colonies by unanimous decision of all representatives present here and by the good counsel of reason and inspiration that precedes us:\n\nFirst, All Kheionai are born free without exception of chaste.\nSecond, No slavery of any kind will be tolerated anymore.\nThird, No one has the right to hold absolute rule. Not even in emergency cases, all decisions are to be taken in council among the virtuous free people.\nFourth, Everyone is eligible for nobility as long as they hold virtue.\nFifth, Nobles who fall into vice will be stripped of their titles, which will be given to another virtuous candidate of "lower" chaste.\nSixth, Servants have the right to hold private property as well as land and once they hold enough property to stop being servants and employ servants they will be know as commoners.\nSeventh, The previous statement implies that the sole reason for servitude is to help those of lower status and of unfortunate circumstances to elevate themselves to the position of nobility.\nEighth, Servants are allowed to change their master employer without restriction as long as their master has enough servants to maintain his landed affairs.\nNinth, Every Nekhei with its respective colony has to abide to these statements and abolish any law that may interfere with them nor can they make laws that may interfere with them. Although they can still be considered free to exercise and manage their own laws as long they are non-harmful to the Act of the United Nekheis."\n\nOur ruler closes the scroll, everyone claps and the sun shines in the marble."
 G62_events.12.a:0 "Huzzah!"
 G62_events.13.t:0 "Liberation"
 G62_events.13.d:0 "Our Eastern neighbor Deyeion was long served as a prison colony for the proud warriors Degakheion. Enemies of the state, deserters and other scum were put into chains and shipped of into the Andic Reach to plow the fields and cultivate the tea plantations. While they have earned some self-governance after numerous rebellions, the people still yearn to break free of their oppressors shackles.\n\nIn many ways our 2 cities are kindred spirits. Are we not both outcasts of the Kheionai? We, the orphaned children of a lost kheion and they, the unwanted of our parent cities´ greatest foe. I say the time has come to liberate our brothers!"
 G62_events.13.a:0 "We have saved you!"
 G62_events.14.t:0 "Last Day Before Sendoff"
 G62_events.14.d:0 "We prepare an escort for a diplomat, a very important diplomat.\n\nHis mission? To finally unite the reach under a strong grip. Ameion has fought its own conquest and adventures in the Taychend for hundreds of years at this point. Whether they have found success there or not, their home lies in the reach, and their interests should lie there as well. Amgremós and Ameion have always had friendly relations as Deyeion, Ameion, and Amgremos have always found themselves united in distance from their Alecandi cousins. We hope that with this escort, that the Echate League may finally be one."
 G62_events.14.a:0 "Good luck."
 G62_events.17.t:0 "Ameion Says Yes"
 G62_events.17.d:0 "The deliberations in Ameion have been a long and arduous process. Groups have formed, some wanting to hold on to the memory of Laskaris, while others saw the need to adjust to the changing times.\n\nAfter days of deliberations and multiple physical altercations Ameion has wisely concluded that they need friends to brave the storms ahead. Together with Deyeion and us the spurned children of Kheios will unify into something far greater than the sums of its parts. No longer will be playthings of the decadent cities of Kheios. We will be our own power and soon eclipse those stuck up island dwellers. This day will be remembered as the birth of the United Echate League."
 G62_events.17.a:0 "Hooray!"
 G62_events.15.t:0 "A Proposition"
 G62_events.15.d:0 "An embassy from the pirate haven of Agremos has arrived in Ameion. They have come with a proposal.\n\nThe cities of the Andic Reach share many things in common. In many ways we are the spurned children of Alecand, unwanted bastards, who had to fight for everything from the time we raised the first huts on this stretch of coast line. Instead of allowing the older cities to play us against one another we should unite together, form a league that is able to stand up to the kheions.\n\nTheir proposal has inflamed a serious debate within the city. Some want to hold onto the memory of Laskaris and follow his vision, others consider this league a wise option. Should we abandon our ambitions in Taychend and throw our whole weight behind this proposed Echate league or should we hold onto our independence and the vision set up by Laskaris?"
 G62_events.15.a:0 "No"
 G62_events.15.b:0 "Yes"
 G62_events.16.t:0 "Ameion Says No"
 G62_events.16.d:0 "The deliberations in Ameion have been a long and arduous process. Groups have formed, some wanting to hold on to the memory of Laskaris, while others saw the need to adjust to the changing times.\n\nAfter days of deliberations and multiple physical altercations Ameion has foolishly decided to turn down our offer of alliance. While they value our friendship their focus continues to linger on Taychend and they have little interest in the happenings to their West."
 G62_events.16.a:0 "War it is then."
 G62_events.18.t:0 "Pirate Days"
 G62_events.18.d:0 "Amgremos has become a vast port city, with ships of all sorts constantly entering from all directions. The city has grown accustomed to it, with the population numbers see-sawing as different crews come and go. But now, the port schedules for a vast number of ships have lined up, and the city is busier than ever before. Without any real planning involved, a number of the captains have taken advantage of the situation to organize a festival of sorts: pirates, merchants, fishermen and sailors alike have gathered in large droves to drink, chat, and sing, meeting old friends and making new friends as they do."
 G62_events.18.a:0 "A good time for the economy too!"
 G62_events.19.t:0 "Pirate Duels"
 G62_events.19.d:0 "As the festival has lasted several days, more and more old rivalries are dug up, and many a pirate and sailor has challenged old enemies to duels. This has done little to lessen the revelry of the festival participants, however; they treat the duels as spectator events, cheering the fighters on and betting on the outcomes. Even musicians see their chance to profit off the spectacle, as they accompany the duels with aggressive music to the beat of the clashing steel.\n\nThe duels have quickly become so popular that many veteran fighters have started to challenge random people to duels, just to prove their skill. In order to keep order in the city, the [Monarch.GetTitle] has quickly ordered the organization of a dueling tournament."
 G62_events.19.a:0 "May the best duelist win!"
 G62_events.20.t:0 "Dueling Tournament Finals"
 G62_events.20.d:0 "It has felt like an eternity. An eternity where the whole city has been enraptured by the games, foreign sailors managed to spectate the last days and even the nobility descended to the beach. In this ecstatic maelstrom, sleep did not matter to pirates and merchants as long as wine and music kept going. Many bled, many fell and many just misstepped, as well as many were victorious. But even said victors were not able to keep further as the last two combatants.\n\nWearing predators’ furs around her armor in the midst of summer’s heat, a "giantess" -for amgremmosi stature- called Istralaniia Damasos weighs her unique tower-shield as she waits.\n\nOur ruler is approached by the frenzied merchants, who seem lost in the most indescribable excitement. They give him/her the honor of placing the first bet. Everyone astonishingly watches as the Kylakas puts his/her golden embroidered upper garment in the betting pile of:"
 G62_events.20.a:0 "Istralaniia!"
 G62_events.21.t:0 "The Duel Begins!"
 G62_events.21.d:0 "The double flutes start vibrating. The combatants start bouncing rhythmically to warm up. The flutes get quicker as drums join. The beach trembles and the sea waves get bigger. Bonfires of incense are burnt as wine drenches in every whistling mouth. Istralaniia gets her legs synced with the drums and alternates between defense and attack postures as she moves either left and right. Her opponent, Eranil, begins to follow suit. Istralaniia quickly realizes the advantage of her opponents agility, she has to finish before getting tired or defeat will await her. The flutes reach the highest pitch, the drums desynchronize intentionally making unbearable noise. The fighters no l\n\nonger need to tune their movements to music, it is the shortest moment, that in every duel, they can act freely. A treasured opportunity arises for both."
 G62_events.21.a:0 "Istralaniia strikes first!"
 G62_events.22.t:0 "First Hit"
 G62_events.22.d:0 "A dry, raw, and short noise sounds across the sand. The clanging of steel on steel, only punctuated by the gasps and screeches of the crowd. Eranil starts cutting quickly. His silk got tangled and buried along Istralaniia’s spear head when he dodged it. Now, the Kheionai giantess comes rushing towards him! Her sword is raised and the ground trembles at her feet. The musicians come back to their senses and the same initial rhythm is back at accelerated speed."
 G62_events.22.a:0 "Istralaniia patiently waits for another opening..."
 G62_events.22.b:0 "Istralaniia dives in!"
 G62_events.23.t:0 "Almost there..."
 G62_events.23.d:0 "Istralaniia lands in her hits, her sword drawn high..."
 G62_events.23.a:0 "THE END! IT COMES!"
 G62_events.24.t:0 "Victory"
 G62_events.24.d:0 "Istralaniia strikes and Eranil dodges, but she answers with a shield bash to his face. The flutes go in madness as he falls to his knees with a nosebleed. The man tries to get up quickly, but the woman releases another slash. The drums reach a crescendo as a hopeless Eranil tries to block with his sword, he knows it is useless. The strike breaks his sword in two, and slashes across his arm, drawing blood. As Eranil slumps down in defeat, spectators rush to pick up the pieces of the sword, as broken as Eranil’s spirit. Musicians, dancers and pirates rush to bathe the giantess in wine, she laughs as she walks to our ruler, who crowns her in a laurel garland."
 G62_events.24.a:0 "PERFECTION!"
 G62_events.25.t:0 "Istralaniia Was Blocked!"
 G62_events.25.d:0 "Eranil freed himself and Istralaniia’s blade is just inches away from him. Istralaniia rushes one last step to strike him down. Eranil outmaneuvers her by throwing one of his black garments to her and advances on her, graceful as a snake, and with the same lethal intent."
 G62_events.25.a:0 "Now all we can do is pray..."
 G62_events.26.t:0 "Counter!"
 G62_events.26.d:0 "Black silk is not enough to blind Istralaniia. She manages to predict Eranil’s movement and bashes his strike with bull’s strength. The man flinches. In a risky maneuver, Istralaniia releases a flurry of slashes and bashes him with her shield. Eranil defends himself, he avoids using his own steel by jumping and dodging. Istralaniia quickly turns and locks his position every time he lands one of his acrobatic jumps. The drums start to drown out the flutes while accelerating. She tries to outspeed him, and sometimes he has no choice but to block. In a few strikes his shield is gone, laying in the sand. He only has his blade now. The music gets faster as their hearts race."
 G62_events.26.a:0 "This is getting exciting!"
 G62_events.27.t:0 "Damnation!"
 G62_events.27.d:0 "Blinded by the black silk, it was too late when Istralaniia felt the burning cut under her arm, near the armpit. It was just a cut and she was used to them, but by the rules of combat, this meant her defeat and the end of the frenzied games. Quite anticlimactically, the music stopped. The crowd stood silently as Eranil walked calmly, with a satisfactory foxy grin, towards our ruler who crowned him with the laurels garland."
 G62_events.27.a:0 "Well done Eranil. Im upset about loosing my money, but at least theres a new head general!"

 thasaros_kheinisi_desc:0 "A government that represents the close ties of the pirates and government of Amgremós.\n\nPirates have representation in government and are able to take part in nationwide debate and elections. In return, the Amgremósi are granted control of pirates as subject, and are able to organize the pirates as if they were apart of their own navy.\n\nOf course, the pirates will still raid and the Amgremósi will still govern, but this system allows for organization that could have never been found if these two parties were to remain seperate. Now everyone benefits from this relationship, and instead of a small pouch of gold for one, a great ton of gold can be shared by many."
