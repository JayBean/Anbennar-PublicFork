 anb_ruler.12.t:0 "A Visit From Death"
 anb_ruler.12.d:0 "Immortal life.\n\nSuch a state can hardly be called living. It's something greater–to become one with the planes, immutable and unchanging. A presence eternal, with potential as vast as the sea of stars above. The world runs ragged in your presence, a slave to its master. As the sun in the sky, you are ever-watchful; even more, for one who is risen need not rise.\n\n"Thy time hath come."\n\nLaugh to scorn the idea. Time is a concept without substance, a vestige of consequence long rebuked. Yet hark, your soulless eye did gaze upon its figure, its form as interminable as your own. Shoddily-jointed fingers clasping a tyrant's zenith–a pretender. You are death, not the charlatan that would seek your title–a mere scythe, no less. In its reflection, you see your visage. Not a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but a geriatric fool asserting [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] as one with power over this world, over this moment.\n\nPower. In life, power was your pursuit. Beyond life, this quest has never ceased, complacency scorned with undying tenacity. Power over the immutable, the unchanging, the foes in your mind, the foe you find hovering before you, clad in a scarlet cloak and adorned with a ruby mask. Your mind's eye quivers with an unfamiliar emotion, one which you tentatively label as fear.\n\nFear. Beyond life, there is only the absolute self, fear sinking into the unfathomable mire of the past, paranoia asserting itself with due likeness, but ultimately a different emotion: one with drive, purpose. A testament. Fear had long since lost its place in your mind, supplanted by a paranoia born of resolve.\n\nResolve. Yes, the resolve to pursue life. The resolve to overcome death. The resolve to become eternal. Surely eternity is not as short as this, is it?"
 anb_ruler.12.a:0 "Resolve supercedes all."
 anb_ruler.12.b:0 "I supercede all."

 anb_ruler.13.d:0 "Otherworldly precision, incomprehensible motive, unfathomable breadth. The only way to defeat such an opponent is to become even more unfathomable, to surpass the natural and become infinite. Such power and resolve, born of paranoia, will not falter in the face of nature itself, regardless of the implement with which it intends to corrode, degrade, and erode one's sense of self. One's consciousness must become a monolith of sheer, unadulterated tenacity, clinging to the world that strives to deliver righteous deliverance.\n\nThe Reaper's scythe approached with a wide swing, promising a swift and painful end. Yet it was met with naught but air, your form now hovering behind your adversary. A single finger is laid upon the Reaper, and with a swift incantation, nature crumbles to a pile of bone ash, crowned with a marvelous cloak, now a trophy."

One's consciousness must become a monolith of sheer, unadulterated tenacity, clinging to the world that strives to deliver righteous deliverance.\n\nBut righteousness is the mantle of the deceiver, true nature hidden in the murky mire of one's own facade. You need not cling to such concepts. You see all, you know all, you are all. Conqueror of the material, one with the immaterial, and elucidator of the fathomless depths of understanding, the universe unspooled at your feet.\n\nYou command the Reaper before you to kneel. Your words carry meaning and intent, your will made sound, reverberating throughout your halls before the Reaper, goading its submission. Yet unlike all before it, your words leave it unaffected. You try again, ardently focusing every ounce of primordial power you possess into one single word: "kneel."\n\nThe Red Reaper buckles, not into a pose of submission, but rather into one of agony, as if forced to the ground by a million invisible hands, crushing the floor beneath it with each passing second. The crunch of bone is heard, then silence.\n\nA pile of cracked bone and torn crimson cloth lies before you. And thus, your day continues."
