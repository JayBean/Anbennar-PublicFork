 bianfang_fortress_with_a_state_title:0 "Fortress with a State"
 bianfang_fortress_with_a_state_desc:0 "Military scholars say that supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting. As mighty as our army is, rushing headlong into a full frontal assault of Hubao, or the Tiger Fort as the Harimari that compose the fortress’s defenders call it, would be suicide.\n\nTherefore, we must capture the fort through other means. We will sever their supply lines, raid nearby farming settlements, and lay waste to their fortifications with siege weaponry. We must break their will, all without having to shed a drop of blood, and leave them no choice but to surrender to the might of the Bianfang."
 bianfang_frontier_fortress_title:0 "The Frontier Fortress"
 bianfang_frontier_fortress_desc:0 "With the so-called Tiger Fort firmly under our control and its previous defenders sufficiently pacified, we must begin to fortify our position, lest we lose our newfound gains to the hobgoblins of the Command or the barbarous Oni to the north. Many of the fort’s previous defenders have begrudgingly, yet wisely, kneel and bow before our King and vowed to earn their place in Bianfang. Despite their oaths of loyalty, we will entrust one of our finest Marshals to oversee the building of fortifications and ensure that the Tiger Fort remains solely under our control."
 bianfang_an_iron_fortress_title:0 "A Fortress of Iron"
 bianfang_an_iron_fortress_desc:0 "Our faithful Marshal who we have placed in charge of the Tiger Fort reports that the Harimari are slowly adjusting to our rule. Even more, the previous quartermaster of the fort has revealed the location of an iron mine not far from the fort itself.\n\nIt would be foolish for us to not take advantage of this opportunity, and a team has already been dispatched to scout out the mine. Our military engineers have recommended that we use this newfound resource to aid in the ongoing building of fortifications in Hubao, further strengthening our bulwark against both any potential Oni and hobgoblin aggressors."
 bianfang_dragons_banner_title:0 "Dragon's Banner"
 bianfang_dragons_banner_desc:0 "Our army continues to grow with each passing day, and while eastern Xianjie is firmly within our grasp, we have greater aspirations than just the farmlands and monasteries we have conquered. A great military theorist once said that to know your enemy, you must become your enemy, and after poring over the endless reports about the Command’s military tactics, we have given the orders down the military chain of command to begin implementing the military model of the Command.\n\nOur warriors must fight with unmatched savagery, and be willing to die for our nation. This paradigm shift will not come without costs, however, but we have long since accepted the fact that adopting this new model will separate the wheat from the chaff."
 bianfang_an_opening_title:0 "An Opening"
 bianfang_an_opening_desc:0 "War has come to the Xianjie, and the First Master of the Xia has called upon the Righteous Masters to answer the call. In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity, and thus, we put our machinations into action. Already our agents embedded deep within eastern Xianjie begin to scout the lands and sow discontent.\n\nWe must throw the eastern fringes of the Xia into disarray and attempt to sever lines of communication between the eastern monks and the heart of the Xia, so that when it comes time for our forces to march, we march against a divided, ill-prepared foe."
 bianfang_subjugate_the_monks_title:0 "Subjugate the Monks"
 bianfang_subjugate_the_monks_desc:0 "The proud warrior monks of Xianjie perch across our border, tempting our people into disobedience, even revolt. They claim that even the lowliest peasant, through study and practice, can become as powerful as the greatest of lords.\n\nDespite all of the knowledge supposedly stored in their temples and libraries, these monks clearly need to be taught a lesson in the error of their ways. Our teaching shall not be imparted with a pen, but a sword."
 bianfang_greater_discipline_title:0 "Greater Discipline"
 bianfang_greater_discipline_desc:0 "Mighty as our army may be, many loyal soldiers have been felled by the Xia dogs during our conquest of the outer reaches of Xianjie. Though for every one soldier we lose in battle, ten loyal sons and daughters of Yanshen answer our call and take up arms to assist us in laying waste to the rest of the Xia that so desperately cling onto their so-called Righteous Path.\n\nBut we cannot achieve such a goal with sheer numbers. They say that victorious warriors win first, and then go to war. With our great army must come great discipline, and our warriors must fight as one. Weakness and hesitation must be purged from our ranks."
 bianfang_monstrous_drill_title:0 "Monstrous Drill"
 bianfang_monstrous_drill_desc:0 "The barbaric hobgoblins of the Command, as savage as they may be, have not established the position they currently hold by sheer luck. Even by our standards, the military might of the Command is something to be admired, and our effort to send scouts and spies to the region are beginning to bear fruit.\n\nCountless reports have come in over the last few weeks characterizing the Command as an entirely militaristic civilization, and every facet of their society is to strengthen, aid, and reinforce their military endeavors. Seemingly every hobgoblin is a warrior first and foremost, with everything else coming second to warfare.\n\nScouts who have watched their training exercises write home about how unified and cohesive they fight as a unit, no matter how small or large their fighting force is. As much as it pains us to admit it, there is much we can learn from their model."
 bianfang_matchlock_warfare_title:0 "Matchlock Warfare"
 bianfang_matchlock_warfare_desc:0 "Our military scientists have recently made a groundbreaking development that they claim will propel our military conquests to new heights. This new invention, which can be best described as a handheld cannon that is fired by lighting a short, twine fuse, has been proved to be incredibly effective at short ranges.\n\nIt is clear to us that we now have the upper hand on the field of battle, and pushing our advantage as much as we reasonably can would be wise. Therefore, we must quickly scramble to produce as many of these powerful weapons as we can before our foes can level the playing field."
 bianfang_increase_conscription_title:0 "Increase Conscription"
 bianfang_increase_conscription_desc:0 "While we may boast that we have the most well-equipped, disciplined, trained army in all of Yanshen, we must further bolster our numbers if we are to achieve our goal of bringing all of Yanshen under our rule. To see to this, we must conscript young, able-bodied warriors of Bianfang.\n\nAs much as some may protest, they will soon realize that the only way we will unite the Yan people is to build an unstoppable military and conquer all those who stand against us. Conquering the bordering Jingqiu provinces to the north would be an excellent first test for our newly conscripted warriors, as well as establishing a foothold for further conquests in the area."
 bianfang_down_the_yan_title:0 "Down the Yan River"
 bianfang_down_the_yan_desc:0 "As many have expected, our foes to the north have capitulated to our military might. Among our newly conquered lands is the city of Jincheng, the seat of the Jiangshi that have, until now, bestowed their wisdom upon Jingqiu for centuries.\n\nNow that the dust has settled, we must now decide what to do about the Jiangshi. Some of our more practical advisors suggest we allow their continued existence in exchange for their assistance in the continued pacification of the people of Jincheng. Others advocate that we eliminate the Jiangshi and their subjects to strengthen our grasp on the city."
 bianfang_storm_the_palaces_title:0 "Storm the Palaces"
 bianfang_storm_the_palaces_desc:0 "With our northern front secured, it is time we direct our conquest further down the Yan River, into the land of the eunuchs. While they have lorded over Yanshen as Harimar’s glorified tax collectors, Harimar is no longer here to protect these weak little men.\n\nThese uppity, opportunistic rulers think themselves safe in their little so-called League of Yanszin, but it’s time we show them what true power is and oust them from their palaces. Our advisors have reminded us that while their army is undoubtedly no match for ours, the eunuchs still wield a considerable amount of political sway in Yanshen, and we’ll need to determine their fate sooner rather than later."
 bianfang_great_cities_title:0 "Great Cities of the South"
 bianfang_great_cities_desc:0 "Through our military conquests, we have acquired large swaths of land that have unfortunately borne the burden of war. With our position as the dominant power in all of Yanshen secured, now is a time for rebuilding.\n\nGreat, prosperous cities will rise from the ashes of our newly conquered land, while settlements, towns, and cities in the heartland of our growing nation continue to grow, prosper, and thrive. When all of Yanshen is finally united under our rule, Bianfang will be home to the greatest cities in all of Haless."
 bianfang_court_of_the_eunuch_king_title:0 "Court of the Eunuch King"
 bianfang_court_of_the_eunuch_king_desc:0 "Xiyun is a strange kingdom. Nephew succeeds uncle, their power is rooted in impotence, and the king lacks more than one kind of scepter. Yet they may prove to be a valuable ally against the savage tea drinkers and press-ganging whalers to the south, as we guard Yanshen against demons and hobgoblins to the north.\n\nWe rightly backed the reigning Xi dynasty against the rebellious eunuchs in the Xiyun Civil War. To continue cultivating our alliance with Xiyun, we should send emissaries to establish a permanent embassy in the Court of the Eunuch King."
 bianfang_xiyun_reunification_title:0 "Xiyun Reunification"
 bianfang_xiyun_reunification_desc:0 "After assassinating Eunuch King Xi Juo in 1430 AA, the traitorous eunuchs and merchants fled Xiyun to the northern districts, proclaiming themselves to be the legitimate government. This upstart state of Luoyi is an affront to the rights of hereditary monarchs, and Xiyun remains vulnerable to outside threat and internal sedition.\n\nAs eunuchs, the Xi dynasty may be too weak to restore and rule their rightful territory without our strong guiding hand. A Treaty of Eternal Protection and Friendship will grant the lands to our south peace and tranquility under our benevolent guidance."
 bianfang_one_king_title:0 "One King in Yanshen"
 bianfang_one_king_desc:0 "An envoy from the Eunuch King has arrived with an ornate invitation to his nephew's Rite of Purification. While watching a young boy be ritually castrated may turn the stomachs of the virile men of Bianfang, we will nevertheless attend as his magnanimous protector and benefactor. Perhaps we should direct our officials in Xiyun to source the finest food and drink from the city’s merchants for the celebratory banquet. And, as the road between [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] and Xiyun may be unsafe, we should be sure to bring a retinue of hardened warriors..."
 bianfang_imperial_capital_title:0 "An Imperial Capital"
 bianfang_imperial_capital_desc:0 "As Yanshen falls under our dominion, Bianfang is growing beyond being the mere guardian of its borders. What was once a provincial outpost now governs an empire.\n\nThe city smells of freshly milled lumber and baking bricks, and everywhere can be heard the shouts of construction foreman mixed with the chants of drilling soldiers and spirited bartering in the newly consecrated Grand Market. Our geomancers have laid plans with auspicious precision for new districts to house the countless peasants and laborers flocking to the city, and the Marshals who will govern them. To reign over it all, construction on a magnificent imperial palace to be clad in gold and porcelain has begun on a hill overlooking the Yanhe, a palace truly fit for the Dragon King. To be an empire worthy of the name, we must first devote the resources necessary to reshape Bianfang into an imperial capital."
 bianfang_facing_zyuhungwok_title:0 "Facing Zyujyut"
 bianfang_facing_zyuhungwok_desc:0 "The forest people to the south hold themselves above all other Yan, having resisted conquest by Harimar and Jaher. Their kings lounge on the Vermillion Throne and proclaim themselves to be blessed by the spirits as the only righteous rulers in Yanshen. Obviously, nothing could be further from the truth. They are in fact little more than petty chieftans of tattooed savages, fond of tea and prostitutes, whose jungle has done far more to defend them from invaders than their magic swords.\n\nThe Zyujyut must now face the discipline and valor of Bianfang armies. The bounty from their tea gardens will fill our coffers, and their precious forests will fuel our forges."
 bianfang_imperial_shipyard_title:0 "An Imperial Shipyard"
 bianfang_imperial_shipyard_desc:0 "The locals call the muddy, bustling port town at the mouth of the Zyusipgang River 'Cuihiok' - Clear Sunrise - an ironic name to bleary-eyed sailors and stevedores as they load small junks with crates of Jyutin tea and barrels of Xiyun gunpowder after a long night at the riverside taverns.\n\nAlthough Cuihiok is for now a mere collection of shacks, sheds, and rotting planks in comparison to the towering temples and vast dockyards of Tianlou, our royal engineers tell us the deep natural harbor could provide excellent anchorage for merchant vessels and warships. Most importantly, the Zyuhungjip Jungle upstream has enough timber for an armada to match the strength of our armies and rival the fleets of our enemies. Constructing shipyards and establishing a merchants quarter will bring the port to its full potential and allow us to project our might from the Bay of Buogoj to the Ringlet Sea."
 bianfang_waypoint_metropolis_title:0 "The Waypoint Metropolis"
 bianfang_waypoint_metropolis_desc:0 "The town of Lamwun first coalesced around a High Temple, and has remained largely as a quick detour for academics and theologians on their way to the much grander High Temples of Tianlou. However, travelers on the road between [4826.GetName] and our newly expanded harbor at Szinyugang have found it to be the perfect midway point to rest and resupply. We should capitalize on Lamwun’s location by building toll roads and canals, and expand the town itself to ensure a steady flow of goods and people from the coast to the capital."

 bianfang_one_people_united_title:0 "One People, United"
 bianfang_one_people_united_desc:0 "For too long, the children of the great Yan River have been divided between squabbling warlords and corrupt eunuchs, ripe for conquest by foreign powers. With the threat of The Command looming on the horizon, we cannot allow history to repeat itself.\n\nUnder our authority and protection, the different peoples of Yanshen will be forged together into one, just as many grains of iron sand are forged into a mighty sword."
 bianfang_the_hills_have_eyes_title:0 "The Hills Have Eyes"
 bianfang_the_hills_have_eyes_desc:0 "The Oni to the North are the most feared monsters from which we have long guarded Yanshen. So long as they remain hermits, locking themselves up in their hill fortresses to study vile tomes, they are a threat only to the local peasants whom they devour. However, they remain brutal and cunning warriors, and can wield devastating magic. They must not be allowed to visit their demonic malice upon our lands."
 bianfang_all_under_the_emperor_title:0 "All Under the Emperor"
 bianfang_all_under_the_emperor_desc:0 "Since the first Dukes of Bianfang raised the citadel, we have stood guard over all the realms downriver. While the eunuchs may have looked down upon us as yokels and brigands, it was by the strength of our armies and discipline of our people that they lived their pampered lives. It is now clear that the only way to truly safeguard Yanshen is to bring it all under the authority and protection of the Dragon Throne."
 bianfang_liang_economic_boom_title:0 "The Harvest of Yanshen"
 bianfang_liang_economic_boom_desc:0 "From a dusty frontier outpost, our empire has grown to the most magnificent realm under the heavens. Everywhere, our fields blossom with grain and fruit, our farm animals multiply by the score, and our cities hum with the flourishing activity of our happy and obedient subjects. Decades of bloodshed have fertilized the lands of the Yanhe, and now our swords may serve as harvest scythes."
 bianfang_city_of_temples_title:0 "Jewel of Yanshen"
 bianfang_city_of_temples_desc:0 "The Great Temple, the Palace of the Divine Call, the Hall of the Rising Sun - Tianlou has long been the nexus of Yanshen, rightly called the Desire of Conquerors. Rising like a great diamond from the mouth of the Yanhe, this city is strategically vital to securing the realms downriver. Moreover, returning the city to its full glory would be the final signifier of our authority to rule all Yanshen."
 bianfang_cries_of_freedom_title:0 "Cries of Freedom"
 bianfang_cries_of_freedom_desc:0 "The peasants of Lanjinhui violated the natural order when they overthrew their rightful lord and proclaimed all men to be equal. This absurd idea is nevertheless dangerous in the inspiration it gives to malcontents in our own realm, just as a single shoot of a vine can grow to strangle an entire tree. Lanjinhui must be uprooted, and these so-called ‘Blue Scarves’ must be torn apart, thread by thread."
 bianfang_imperial_army_restructuring_title:0 "Imperial Army Restructuring"
 bianfang_imperial_army_restructuring_desc:0 "Centuries of frontier warfare have honed our armies into the most disciplined and effective of all Yanshen, capable of defeating individual foes of greater prowess through superior tactics and cohesion. Other Yansheni realms had not had these trials by fire, and their soldiers were all the weaker for it. While this allowed us to defeat them easily, now that they are loyal citizens expected to serve, we must restructure our armies to train these weaklings up to our exacting standards."
 bianfang_the_lawless_west_title:0 "The Lawless West"
 bianfang_the_lawless_west_desc:0 "We have taken the spiritual capital of the Xiaken, dealing them a crushing blow. The remaining monks still present a danger that cannot be ignored. So long as they practice their martial arts and spread their undermining ideals, they are a threat to our authority."
 bianfang_ramp_up_recruitment_title:0 "Ramp Up Recruitment"
 bianfang_ramp_up_recruitment_desc:0 "To the west, the Hobgoblin Command overwhelms Rahen and may soon turn its steely gaze toward us. To the north, the Bird Riders of Shuvüüshudi trample all in their path. So long as they menace our realms, our people must be ready to take up arms and defend Yanshen."
 bianfang_pathetic_barbarism_title:0 "Pathetic Barbarism"
 bianfang_pathetic_barbarism_desc:0 "The riders of the Terror Birds have struck fear into the hearts of many Yan, as the name would imply. Nevertheless, we have faced worse terrors.\n\nOur Marshals know that no matter how fearsome the bird, with a big enough blade and a hot enough fire, it can be beheaded, plucked, and roasted. Already they are devising plans to burn the steppe to deny fodder for their mounts, and trample these barbarians into submission."
 bianfang_the_jade_seal_fleet_title:0 "The Jade Seal Fleet"
 bianfang_the_jade_seal_fleet_desc:0 "Now that we command the vast coastline and great harbors and shipyards of Yanshen, we may look to the sea to project our power further than ever before. The lands of the Kai are rich, and our traders have been eager to access their markets and exploit their resources.\n\nTo protect our merchants and ensure the flow of trade, we must construct a grand fleet and recruit a navy to rival the strength of our army. Soon, the Stormcloud of the West will march over the waves as a great typhoon."
 bianfang_monuments_to_insignificance_title:0 "The Hermit Kingdom"
 bianfang_monuments_to_insignificance_desc:0 "We share much in common with the Odheongun to the North. Their skill at the bow almost matches our own at the dao and jian, their innovations in bureaucracy have inspired our administrators, and they have stood as a beacon of civilization against the rampaging hordes of the Shuvuush, just as we have stood against the demons and hobgoblins. However, their lands have long been ruled by foreign conquerors or divided by civil war. Their people cry out for a return to safety and prosperity. It is up to us to end their self-imposed isolation and division, and bring the Hermit Kingdom into the fold."
 bianfang_kudet_kai_foothold_title:0 "Foothold in Kudet Kai"
 bianfang_kudet_kai_foothold_desc:0 "The vast rice paddies of Kudet Kai and its cosmopolitan capital at Niravonkai sit a stone’s throw from our southern border. With the peaks of the Phokhao running all the way to the sea and making a land invasion impracticable, we must use our mighty fleet to launch a naval assault and secure a beachhead in these rich lands."
 bianfang_townships_and_dwarf_kings_title:0 "The King in the Mountain"
 bianfang_townships_and_dwarf_kings_desc:0 "The hold of the Nephrite Dwarves lies to the south of Yanshen across the crest of the Phokhao, filled with treasures crafted by dwarven ingenuity and magic. They lord over the native Kai, appointing their kings and diverting their wealth into their coffers. Securing Verkal Ozovar and the human lands over which it claims suzerainty is the next step in safeguarding Yanshen in all directions, and will surely fill the treasury to the brim with loot."
 bianfang_sikai_townships_title:0 "Salt, Silver, and Sun Elves"
 bianfang_sikai_townships_desc:0 "The townships of Sikai lay claim to valuable resources that could fuel our economy and armies, particularly salt and silver. They are also home to an oddity: some of the few elves who remained in Haless after Jaher’s empire was shattered. It is only fitting that they should now be brought under our dominion, given their forefather’s conquest of Yanshen."
 bianfang_our_greatest_foe_title:0 "Our Greatest Foe"
 bianfang_our_greatest_foe_desc:0 "‘Advance scouts report of strange red demons, tall in stature, clad in black enamel, marching in strict formation. Left Column arrives at Wudikmen village of Niaolin at high noon to find demons in midst of raid. Frontline archers engage, demons retreat from village in good order under covering volleys. Further investigation required.’\n-Dispatch of Marshal Xinzhu Long to Duke of Bianfang during a 1430 expedition into Wudikmen, the first record of Yan engaging the Command\n\nFor decades, the Hobgoblin Command has presented the gravest threat to all of Haless. The danger of this common enemy drove us to unify Yanshen, and our own discipline and unity was enhanced by theirs as a countermeasure. Both enemy and inspiration, the Command must be dealt a crushing blow if Yanshen is to be safe."
 bianfang_final_command_title:0 "The Final Command"
 bianfang_final_command_desc:0 "Marching in lockstep, fording the rivers and crossing the deserts of the Ruin Kingdoms without rest, obeying an unbreakable chain of command: the soldiers of Dahui grow ever more indistinguishable from their hobgoblin foes. Both enemy and example, we have learned much from them, and they us. Indeed, some hobgoblins have even taken to calling themselves the Dragon Command in our honor. It is clear that there is room for only one of us in Haless. Our stormcloud will drive them back to the caves and foothills from which they emerged, never to return."
 bianfang_restore_desecrated_temples_title:0 "Restore the Temples"
 bianfang_restore_desecrated_temples_desc:0 "After the antitheistic hobgoblins overran northern Rahen, the High Temples there were left damaged or derelict. As students of High Philosophy, it is our duty to restore these sacred sites and preserve the wisdom contained within."
 bianfang_rebuild_shamakhad_title:0 "Rebuild the Ruin Kingdoms"
 bianfang_rebuild_shamakhad_desc:0 "The Nadimraj was the first civilization to rise in Rahen, and it’s heirs, the Ruin Kingdoms, were the first to fall to the Command. While their martial weakness cannot be denied, their historical legacy deserves a modicum of respect. The people of Shamakhad will be eternally grateful to the Dragon Throne for the resources we devote to the reconstruction of their lands after so many decades of Hobgoblin domination."
 bianfang_risen_from_ruins_title:0 "Risen from Ruins"
 bianfang_risen_from_ruins_desc:0 "From Old Bianfang to the docks of Tianlou, merchants, soldiers, and commonfolk seeking to escape the crowded cities of Dahui proper flow upstream to where the Yanhe meets the Nadilavhan. Since wresting control of Sarilavhan from the Command, the old capital has served as a focal point in our efforts to renew Shamakhad. Day by day, paper lanterns and signs in Yan script adorn the utilitarian hobgoblin architecture, and tenaments sprout up where slave quarters once stood." #Rename Erjiangcheng (Two River City)?
 bianfang_no_longer_defiant_title:0 "No Longer Defiant"
 bianfang_no_longer_defiant_desc:0 "It is said that when Xinzhu Long heard of the Emperor of Baihon Xinh defying death to cling to power as a wraith, he laughed and quipped ‘Only fitting for a shade to rule that land, itself a shadow of its former radiance.’ Indeed, that ancient and mighty realm has been defying death for too long, shambling on through civil wars and foreign dominion. It is time to exorcise these ghosts, and let the Yan, so full of life, take their place."
 bianfang_push_to_the_kharunyana_title:0 "Push to the Kharunyana"
 bianfang_push_to_the_kharunyana_desc:0 "The Bom have been under the illusion that their forts, guarded by the living and the dead, will forever ensure their independence. They did not learn their lesson from Jaher when he strode triumphantly into the great Necropolis. So, they must learn from us. We shall tutor them with gunpowder and cannonballs."
 bianfang_man_the_forts_title:0 "Man the Forts"
 bianfang_man_the_forts_desc:0 "The Kharunyana is the great divider between Rahen and the rest of Haless, crossable only at a few key points. As we prepare to launch our invasion across the river, we should be sure that the rear of our armies is safeguarded."
 bianfang_monsoon_season_title:0 "Slash and Burn"
 bianfang_monsoon_season_desc:0 "Xinzhu Long’s campaigns against Zyujyut were a stroll in a lush garden compared to the jungle warfare in the Lupulan. Unceasing rain. Swarms of insects, snakes, and worse monstrosities. Mud deep enough to swallow oxen, carts, horses, and men. And local spirits eager to rip mortals apart, body and spirit. But our soldiers have faced the harsh lands of the Demon Hills and Shuvuush wastes, and our hands are used to the grip of the axe and the torch."
 bianfang_jahers_furthest_city_title:0 "Jaher's Furthest City"
 bianfang_jahers_furthest_city_desc:0 "The Kelino were barely more than tribesmen clinging to the coast when Jaher established a port of call to service his armies in Yanshen. But in the centuries since, Arawkelin has grown to be a central player, exerting influence in the sea lanes between Yanshen and Rahen. Taking the port would greatly expand our trade network, and give us a base from to counter piracy in the Ringlet Sea and spread our influence further west."
 bianfang_the_empires_servants_title:0 "The Empire's Servants"
 bianfang_the_empires_servants_desc:0 "Centuries of division into bickering statelets have left Yanshen a patchwork of administrative styles and divisions. The court eunuchs, the civil administrators of the Xingshen, and the Marshals all compete for influence in our burgeoning empire. These power struggles only serve to compromise the efficiency of Dahui’s bureaucracy, and therefore our military and security. These different administrators must be molded into one cohesive unit to properly serve the Dragon Throne."
 bianfang_military_administrative_complex_title:0 "Stratocratic Administration"
 bianfang_military_administrative_complex_desc:0 "Monstrous as they may be, the stunning success of the Command cannot be denied. Each hobgoblin knows their place in the order, and plays their part in the ensemble without deviation or dissent. All of their society is bent toward the military success of the state. Centuries of conflict have honed our subjects into a disciplined whole, but we still have much to learn from these powerful foes."
 bianfang_perfect_army_title:0 "A Perfect Army"
 bianfang_perfect_army_desc:0 "\n§OTen cracks of thunder,\nTen bursts of flame, plumes of smoke:\nThe dragon takes wing.§! \n-Sister Aja of the Flowing Claw, Jinhusi warrior-poet\n\nThe discipline of a hobgoblin, the wisdom of a harimari, the valor of a Xiaken, the ingenuity of a Goldscale, the fury of an Oni, and the unstoppable flood of the Yan: our armies have taken in the best from all we vanquish, and forged them into a unique fighting force, one unrivaled since the Jaher’s Phoenix Legions. At the crossroads of Haless, the White Dragon is poised to take flight, his shadow and flame soon to reach every corner."
 bianfang_yan_population_boom_title:0 "Grains of Rice and Salt"
 bianfang_yan_population_boom_desc:0 "The unity of Yanshen under the dragon throne has allowed for the free movement of goods and people, unhindered by borders and not wasted in pointless wars. As a result, the population has soared to unprecedented levels. Cities and towns spill beyond their historical boundaries, every scrap of land is put under cultivation, and the ranks of the army are filled with landless sons. Our people grow as numerous as grains of rice in an endless field, as grains of salt melted into the sea. Our land must grow to accommodate them."
 bianfang_our_superior_culture_title:0 "A Poem in a People"
 bianfang_our_superior_culture_desc:0 "A learned scholar of Yangchen and a hardened frontiersman of Jiantsang. A Feiten whaler stinking of oil, and a perfumed and tattooed mistress of a Flower Boat floating down the Zyusipgang. Scarred and hardened Bianfang sergeants-at-arms, savvy Beikdugang merchants, and scrappy hustlers from the streets of Tianlou. All stand above their counterparts in other nations. For no matter what task a Yansheni sets out to do, they shall accomplish it with sublime perfection, adding another verse to the epic poem of Dahui. So too shall our nation contribute to the poem of the world by bringing the magnificent light of the Yan to all corners of Haless."
 bianfang_yanification_kai_title:0 "Settlers of the South"
 bianfang_yanification_kai_desc:0 "On the other side of the Phokhao lies the rich land of Thidnikai, home to bountiful rice paddies, horse-filled plains, and prosperous townships. Jade Seal merchants have already established trading enclaves on the coast. To push further into the interior, we should grant Naamjyut settlers tracts of land, rights to local corvee labor, and other special privileges to bring their agricultural mastery and our way of life among the Kai natives."
 bianfang_yanification_lupulan_title:0 "Blood of Pirates"
 bianfang_yanification_lupulan_desc:0 "The Pinghoi pirates claim to have descended from a Zyujyut queen who absconded with a massive armada and established her own buccaneer kingdom in the south. Their silly royal pretentions aside, they are to be respected for having established a powerful Yan presence in the southern seas. Granting them mercantile and toll rights in every river of Lupulan will help bring their influence from their islands into the interior."
 bianfang_yanification_xianjie_title:0 "Foothold in the Foothills"
 bianfang_yanification_xianjie_desc:0 "According to the Szitu Yan of Xianjie, their ancestors were free thinkers who escaped the oppressive and corrupt regimes of Yanshen proper to found their monasteries devoted to the Righteous Path. In truth, they were little more than tax dodgers and army deserters fleeing into the hills. However, they did build a foothold of Yan language and culture in these lands. Mandating that all teachings and religious services be given in Szitu under penalty of hard labor would surely encourage its spread."
 bianfang_yanification_bomdan_title:0 "Yan in the Forts"
 bianfang_yanification_bomdan_desc:0 "Though the forts of the Bom could not withstand our armies, they are still of continued strategic importance. We have established permanent garrisons to rebuild and maintain them, and we should now encourage our soldiers stationed there to take native women for wives, so that we may be seen not as a foreign conqueror, but as a beloved patriarch."
 bianfang_yanification_steppes_title:0 "To Tame the North"
 bianfang_yanification_steppes_desc:0 "The great prairies of the Shuvuush have long been wasted on raising their ridiculous birds, and the valleys of the Ondeoghun have had their economic potential stunted by that people’s self-imposed isolation.

The first is an ornately carved sandalwood chest, with fine gold inlay depicting a mighty harimari warrior vanquishing a horned ogre. In the box is a scroll composed in [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s elegant calligraphy, a letter extolling the virtues of [Y03.Monarch.GetName], [Y03.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hubao, fellow guardian of the borders of Yanshen. It notes [Y03.Monarch.GetHerHis] clear martial prowess, having been chosen by [Y03.Monarch.GetHerHis] fellow soldiers to lead them, and [Y03.Monarch.GetHerHis] deft skill as an administrator and protector of the hillfolk clustered around the fort. It subtly weaves in Hubao’s history of ‘Conditional Obeisance’ to the Phoenix Empire and its successors, submitting to a greater power while retaining some autonomy. It makes clear that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is similarly courting the Tiger Fort to be an honored subject of [Root.GetName].\n\nThe second object is a simple iron dao, the symbol of authority for a Marshal leading the armies of [Root.GetName] and administering the territories they conquer. Such a force had already mustered, ready to march to the border at Szinbao.\n\nMarshal Shi finishes the kowtow and looks up at his sovereign, waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to choose."

Inside is a scroll addressed to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] from [Y03.Monarch.GetName] [Y03.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], written in sharp, clawlike characters. As in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s letter to the commander of the Tiger Fort, the [Y03.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hubao heaps praise and accolades upon [Y03.Monarch.GetHerHis] counterpart, fellow shield of Yanshen against the monsters and barbarians to the north, whose warriors are as strong and swift as the mighty Yanhe.\n\nWith gratuitous humility, [Y03.Monarch.GetTitle] [Y03.Monarch.GetName] laments that Huibao cannot reach its full defensive potential, lacking the coin to feed its soldiers, purchase weapons, and make repairs to the fortress. It poses the question of whether a generous benefactor could restore Hubao to its reputation as an impregnable fortress. Seeing through the flattery and pleasant falsehoods, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] understands perfectly what is required for Hubao’s conditional obeisance.\n\nDispatching a courtier to make arrangements with the treasury for the bribe, [Root.Monarch.GetName] turns his attention to Jianlin Shi. The Marshal has proven himself as a shrewd diplomat. Perhaps he would be more useful sipping tea with foreign dignitaries than spilling blood on the battlefield?"

The box is filled with the Cat’s Cut, putrid meat cakes made out of thin shavings scraped from animal bones, the staple of a Hubao soldier’s diet. [Y03.Monarch.GetTitle] [Y03.Monarch.GetName] [Y03.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], having clearly taken leave of [Y03.Monarch.GetHerHis] senses, has nevertheless made [Y03.Monarch.GetHerHis] answer clear: [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s offer and the might of [Root.GetName]’s armies are worth no more than mincemeat.\n\n[Y03.Monarch.GetTitle] [Y03.Monarch.GetName]’s insult will be answered shortly and severely: [Y03.Monarch.GetHerHis]’s mangled body will hang from the fortress’s battlements and [Root.GetName]’s banners will fly from its towers. Right now we must decide what to do with Jianlin Shi. His failure is a disgrace for him and all of his kin. Perhaps removing his hands, feet, and head, and those of all of his male relatives out to the fifth degree would also remove this blemish on their honor, and inspire our other Marshals to succeed where he failed. On the other hand, we could spare him to ensure his undying loyalty, and use his considerable talents in warfare to topple the Tiger Fort."

 bianfang.5.d:0 "Flutes and gongs, the smell of roasting meats and sweet wine, and the kaleidoscopic flurry dancers and acrobats fill the palace’s great hall as the eunuch lords of Xiyun feast beside intact lords of [Root.GetName]. At the high table sits [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] of [Root.GetName], eternal friend and protector of the Sceptreless Kingdom. The ostensible honoree of the lavish banquet, Eunuch King [Y21.Monarch.GetName] [Y21.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]’s nephew, lies unconscious in the royal chambers, attended to by the court physicians and herbalists, uncertain to survive this morning’s Rite of Purification. But the House of [Y21.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] always has more nephews to choose from. [Y21.Monarch.GetName] [Y21.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] laughs and drinks deeply from a silver goblet of rice wine. The drink and merriment has put out of mind the growing fear that one day [Root.GetName]’s relentless march to unify Yanshen would turn south and arrive at [Y21.Monarch.GetHerHis] gates.\n\nThe plan had required subterfuge, not the brute strength of [Root.GetName]’s armies. A bag of silver in the right hands, or a knife to the right throat. The vengeful heir of a banished merchant house financed the venture. A disgraced alchemist exiled from the House of Fire and Water supplied the poison, and the antidote for [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue. The [Root.GetName] garrison commanders embedded in Xiyun’s towns would deploy at sundown, arrest and execute the local eunuch lords, and proclaim the new ruler of these lands, just as the main course is served in the palace.\n\n[Y21.Monarch.GetName] relishes the broiled Dire Python, brought from the remote Lupulan Rainforest for the auspicious occasion. A moment later, with a rasping cough, blood spurts from [Y21.Monarch.GetHerHis] mouth, soon echoed by the gathered eunuch lords and members of the [Y21.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family. The Eunuch King’s sworn protectors, the Summer Guard, are cut down as [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s heavily armed retinue breaks through the great hall’s doors. As [Y21.Monarch.GetName] crawls toward [Y21.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne, choking on [Y21.Monarch.GetHerHis] own blood, [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes up [Root.Monarch.GetName.GetHerHis] great chui, and swings the mighty mace down on [Y21.Monarch.GetHerHis] head."

The Bianfang officials assure us that Xiyun would have absolute autonomy in its internal affairs, and that the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] would never meddle in the affairs of the Eunuch King. However, those few who oppose this treaty claim we would become little more than a puppet state of Bianfang, and they criticize the conduct of the Bianfang delegation.

They do not understand that this is what the Yan need, if they hope to survive the onslaught of the monstrous Hobgoblin Command. Yanshen needs an iron fist, unification and firm rule.\n\nHowever alien our rule may be to the locals, we must ensure their loyalty, one way or another.

On the far horizon, the Temple of the Keepers is barely visible, and within, Kongren, the Void's Edge.\n\nThe monks, with all of their Schools and Styles and mysterious martial arts, put up a fierce resistance, but our discipline and numbers eventually overcame them. Now, their temples lie open before us, filled with riches and priceless artifacts crafted by generations of monks.  We would be well within our rights to sack these temples, put them to the torch, cart the plunder back to [Root.Capital.GetName], and declare these robed ruffians outlaw, to be executed on sight. They have long labeled us tyrants and despots, inciting our people to rebel in the name of ‘freedom’ - just another word for chaos.

A cohort of guards surround the inner sanctum around the clock, keeping the sword under constant protection. The next morning, the court mages are to arrive from [Root.Capital.GetName] to discern its secrets. One of the guards hears a whisper of movement, but dismisses it as wind in the trees.\n\nLegend holds that the Keepers, creators and supreme masters of the Art of Bladedancing, are able to kill with impunity within twenty paces, their swords impossibly swift and accurate. The cunning generals of [Root.GetName] devised a counter to this style: stay far away from the blades altogether. The armies of [Root.GetName] completely encircled the temple with mortar batteries and regiments of gunmen. With shouts of ‘Storm! Storm! Storm!’ they hurled ceaseless torrents of shot and shells over the temple wall. The Keepers put up a nigh superhuman resistance. [Root.GetName] soldiers watched in awe as monks sliced a hurtling cannonball clean through, or swept aside a volley of bullets as if they were motes of dust. However, their swords eventually shattered, their chi eventually gave out, and the gates of the temple opened.\n\nWhen the mages arrive at the inner sanctum in the morning, they find the door swung open, and the guards cut to pieces. Examining the bodies in awe, they see arms severed at the shoulder in one clean stroke, and heads separated from the neck precisely between two vertebrae, as if carved up by the most sublime butcher. Soon they receive word from the local damestear mine that the trusses supporting the shafts had been similarly sliced through with delicate precision. The collapsed tunnels will take months, if not years, to repair. Entering the inner sanctum, the mages are not shocked to see the Void’s Edge gone from the altar, and the sigil of the Order neatly carved in its place."

 bianfang.13.t:0 "Fate of the Eunuchs"
 bianfang.13.d:0 "When Harimar united Yanshen under one banner for the first time in its history, he created a caste of servants to administer his conquests in his name. Made impotent by either spell or knife, these eunuchs could have no hereditary legacy of their own, and reviled by the Yansheni nobility, they were absolutely loyal to Harimar and his successors. Through their privileged positions, they amassed power and wealth, and their influence crept into every corner of the land. When the reign of the Harimari ended, the eunuchs began to rule in their own right. Their guile and ruthless self-interest ensured that any attempt by the hereditary nobility to seize power was swiftly cut short with bribery or assassination. Even the great conqueror Jaher was felled not on the field of battle, but by a eunuch’s knife.\n\nPerhaps centuries of being the puppet masters of Yanshen made them overconfident, for they did not foresee a great stormcloud rising in the west until we were at their doorstep. Now the swift sword of [Root.GetName] has cut their strings. From the cultured river port of Yanzhong to the ancient citadel of Guhe, the so-called League of Yanszin lies shattered before us. The question remains of what to do with the eunuchs. With an independent power base and a well-proven ability to assassinate any would-be conquerors, they present an undeniable threat within our own borders. On the other hand, their centuries of rule have made them superb in the arts of statecraft and administration."

In an annual rotation determined by celestial movements, peasants slash down a part of forest and char the timber, tilling it back into the soil in a ritual overseen by a local shaman. The famed tea gardens spout their bountiful harvests from this sacred burnt earth. Subjecting the locals to a strict routine of corvee labor to char more of the jungle could amplify the harvest tenfold, and conscripting and resettling their shamans could bring this technique to our other farmlands. However, this would no doubt infuriate the populace, such that we may find ourselves face yet another war in the jungle.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] raises the fine porcelain teacup to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lips, what must be done becomes clear in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind."

From the Wandaoji, their emissary bears an ornate porcelain and gold mask, fit for a ruler of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s stature, beautiful but disturbingly skull-like. The Shudiyi have sent their emissary with a sublimely sharp jian, almost crackling with unseen dark energies.\n\nThe three Rulers of the Night smile as [Root.Monarch.GetName] reaches out to take the sword, when his chief Marshal intercedes, urging the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] not to touch the weapon lest he be cursed and enthralled to the wicked Jiangshi. Knowing the man to be a zealous practitioner of the Righteous Path, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stays [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand, and turns to look at his Chancellor, who is eyeing the crate of books with envy. A student of High Philosophy, disinterested in the squabbles between the two different Paths, he advocated for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to extend the same protection and demand the same service of the Lefthand Path as their Righteous cousins.

Regardless of their history, they are reviled in every corner of Haless, from Bhuvauri to Beikdugang. Holed up in their Shirgii fortresses, practicing their dark arts and collecting forbidden knowledge, they had been inward facing and hermetic for centuries. Nevertheless, the constant threat that they would descend from their mountain strongholds, cross our borders, and fill the Yanhe with [Root.GetName] blood and bodies, demanded that the Demon Hills be subjugated. The tens of thousands of our soldiers felled by their powerful mystical warriors were well worth the tens of millions which the Oni would have devoured.\n\nOur many citizens who follow the Righteous Path, as well as the great majority of nations in Haless, call for these demons to be hunted down to the last and the Shigrii be destroyed.

Some chafed under the rigid routine of toil and training that was life in the cities and farms of [Root.GetName]. But most simply had no choice in the matter, being forcibly resettled to build roads and bridges, drain cursed swamps, and terrace the hills to plant rice and millet.\n\nThey had been told that the Oni were no longer a threat, scattered to the wind, their Shirgii shattered by the might of our armies. A lie, exposed once they entered the highlands and passed empty villages once full of pioneers like them: bodies torn to pieces, crushed with clubs, and feasted upon. As they left the wagon train and started pitching their tents, gathering firewood, and planting their first gardens, the rumors began to trickle in from their neighbors. Children devoured, brothers bewitched to turn their swords on each other, entire farmsteads vanished in a cloud of red smoke and booms of sinister laughter.\n\nStill, for each settlement the demons have wiped out, two more take its place, and for each company of soldiers massacred, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has sent a battalion. One by one the demons have been hunted down and annihilated.

In 1433, when Ziyou Longxiu lead the Blue Scarves militia to take up arms against Xinzhu Long’s fellow warlord and rival, Hao Huang of Jiangdu, the Dragon King did not envision that a decade later the Ox Banner would fly over great swathes of Eastern Yanshen. Had he known Lanjinhui would plant dangerous seeds of hope in every commoner that they had a right to govern, he would not have dismissed the Blue Scarves as merely another peasant rabble.\n\nAstonishingly, Ziyou Longxiu proved true to his word - he became not another despotic general, but a first among equals in the new peasant republic. The resulting confederation of towns and villages was an affront to the divinely-given right to rule owned by those of noble blood like the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Dynasty. Order itself called out for its destruction. By all that is right, these peasants ought to return to their station. Fifteen years of corvee labor as tribute from each household would do well to break their delusions of equality.\n\nWe must note, however, recent reports from our Marshals describe a peasantry full of a vitality and vigor lacking in our own. They appear to be equally adept at wielding a sword as a plow, and nearly all of them read, gifting us a large pool of recruits to the lowest tiers of the bureaucracy. While a full fledged peasant republic must never be allowed to exist, perhaps allowing these commoners to retain some minor trappings of self-governance at the local level would ease their transition into the rightful order of things."

Master craftsmen, tireless miners, and fearsome warriors, they have always kept to themselves in small enclaves in the larger Yansheni city states. Given enough rice wine, they will loudly trumpet tales of their once mighty empire deep in the caves of the Jade Mines. Over the ridge of the Phokhao, they have established a petty kingdom, lording over the native Kai. Their glittering hold of Verkal Ozovar provides some proof of their boastful claims.\n\nThe hold’s massive gates and abjurative wards proved to be a particular challenge for our generals. It took months of continuous cannon fire and sapping expeditions to bring them down, and waves of troops to clear each level. Eventually, wth the malachite floors of the throne room slicked with Duongjan and Dahui blood, the Wizard King bent the knee and offered his regnal axe to our Marshal. He has dispatched a messenger to the capital, requesting guidance on what is to be done with the dwarves. The Minister of Revenue notes that every hall of Verkal Ozovar contains crafts and treasures greater than a year’s output of our workshops. Carting the loot back to [Root.Capital.GetName] would be fair recompense for the lives lost taking the hold. The Chancellor counters the martial and material skills of the dwarves would enrich the whole nation. Leaving them some authority to govern their own affairs, and establishing dwarven quarters in Yanshen proper, may allow us to reap benefits over generations, rather than a shortsighted sacking."

For we have done what no Raja could accomplish: we have vanquished the hobgoblin armies, their leaders fleeing back to the hills and caves from which they emerged to wreak havoc so many years ago, their citizens at our mercy. They have left their mark on the land, settling areas which humans had fled, building their own towns and cities, spreading their language and customs. Even the most militaristic Dahui patriot would admit that years of fighting the hobgoblins have left their mark on us too. We could not have bested them had we not studied their ways, and learned from each defeat they handed us.\n\nThe hobgoblin people, though some still refuse to call them that, kneel before us. We could extend our hand to a vanquished foe, lift them up, and have them fill our vacant ranks.

These ‘brown orcs’ - tusked, frenzied, and ferocious - brought to mind feral hogs, and indeed it took half a dozen men to take one down with halberds and crossbow bolts. We learned from captured Command lieutenants, after hours and days on the rack, that the hobgoblins had enslaved the orcs generations ago, and had brought them from the Serpentspine to serve as disposable shock troops and heavy laborers. Although they had tried to break free more than once, the chains and the whips of the Command had always brought the brown orcs to heel.\n\nThe Command now lies shattered before us, and we must decide their fate. Our scholar-bureaucrats suggest that slaves or not, they bear resposibility for the ravaging of Haless as much as the hobgoblins. Ministers in the Office of Integration note that while the brown orcs have intermixed with local Raheni and over the generations a new caste of half-orcs has developed, to truly integrate them into Dahui would require breaking their clan structure, forcibly resettling them into different areas, and mandating intermarriage with pureblooded Yan to rapidly temper their savage nature. Our Marshals have pushed back, noting that their strength and numbers would be invaluable in rebuilding Rahen, and with enough drilling and discipline their fearless warriors would add a savage edge to our armies."

 bianfang.206.d:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of [Root.GetName] steps off the royal barge, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] senses are immediately overwhelmed with the sights, sounds, and smells of Sramaya. It had been many months since [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had departed from [Root.Capital.GetName] on a tour of [Root.GetName]’s new territories. Passing under the shadow of Mount Tugahyasa, with thousands of corvee laborers portaging the royal flotilla from the Yanhe to the Kharunyana, receiving the finest wares from the Porcelain Cities, and finally arriving at the mouth of the great river, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] takes in the grandest city of Rahen. Walking through the grand bazaars, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sees goods from every corner of the world - Cannorian firearms, Mithril plate from the Dwarovar, fine hardwood from the Lupulan, and exotic animals from Aelantir. At the heart of the market stand thousands of the city’s most famous wares from as many diverse origins. Nude and shackled to each other, some weep, while others stoically stare at the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nSome of the more superstitious commoners tell stories of the dragon spirit Yanhe liberating the ancient Yan, who had been enslaved by a race of evil wizards. While this myth has no basis in the historical record, Yanshen had never adopted the institution of slavery, unlike our Raheni neighbours. No matter the degree of lowliness, each Yansheni ultimately owned himself, and could expect to share at least a meager portion of the fruits of his labor. The Office of Integration has issued memoranda advocating for the manumission of these poor souls as the first step to securing the populace’s obedience. However, representatives of the Jade Seal merchants have urged caution before pursuing full abolition, with dreams of profits gleaming in their eyes."

 bianfang.207.t:0 "Fate of the Kelino Merchants"
 bianfang.207.d:0 "The Chancellor of [Root.GetName] was sitting down to his morning tea, reviewing financial reports from different departments and ministries, when a courier entered carrying a scroll with a black wax seal. He had been reviewing the month’s memorandum from the Vice Ministry of Commerce, which once again reported astonishing revenues from trade, as it had ever since [Root.GovernmentName] had secured the port of Arawkelin. This had not merely been the subject of dry missives from the imperial bureaucracy, but was reflected in the splendid panoply of exotic goods on display in the Grand Bazaar of [Root.Capital.GetName]. It would seem the Jade Seal merchants had outdone themselves.\n\nHowever, the scroll the courier bore, from the Directorate of Perpetual Happiness, told a different story. Agents and informers from withing the houses of the Jade Seal merchants attested to wide scale fraud. In an apparent effort to save time and capital in dismantling and recreating the trade routes long established by Kelino merchants, they had simply rented their Jade Seal rights to the locals for a hefty fee. According to the Directorate, there was a huge network based in Arawkelin of native traders posting as Yan magnates.\n\nThe Chancellor put down the scroll and ordered a larger, stronger pot of tea be brought to him. It went without question that the laziness and fraud of Jade Seal merchants be punished severely. Revoking their rights, seizing their property, banishing them from their cities, and crippling them and their male relatives out to the fifth degree so that they would live as beggars would be a proportionate response to their thievery. But the fate of the native Kelino traders was not so obvious to him. It would be well received among the remaining Jade Seal merchant houses to wipe out the Kelino and grant them the rights and property. However, this would surely unsettle the harmony of the record trade profits [Root.GetName] was enjoying. The Kelino merchants had shown initiative and resourcefulness, and the fruits of their labor could hardly be denied. Granting them their own Jade Seals, on the condition of adopting the Yan language and customs, would perhaps even further the reach of [Root.GetName]’s trade networks. He pondered the choice deeply before drafting a note to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] with his recommended course of action."
 bianfang.207.a:0 "Grant them the Jade Seal"
 bianfang.207.b:0 "The rights of the Yan must not be diluted"
 bianfang.299.t:0 "The Conquest of Rahen"
 bianfang.299.d:0 "Over a millennium and a half ago, a Raheni conqueror leapt out from the West and tore through Yanshen with vicious fangs and furious claws. A thousand years later, another western tyrant crossed the Kharunyana into our lands, and burned them with pitless phoenix-fire. In the centuries since then, we have rebuilt Yanshen and unified its people into the most glorious and radiant realm in all the epochs of the world.\n\nWe have marched north into the brutal steppe, where the thunder of our cannons drowned out the stampede of the terrorbirds. We have marched south into the fetid jungles, where cascades of our musketballs drenched the savages and pirates. The time for the west to feel the buffeting winds of the stormcloud and the cleansing flame of the dragon has come."

 bianfang.300.d:0 "Decades have passed since the first Yan settlers arrived in [Root.GetName], paving the way for more recent waves. Second sons, unwanted daughters, petty criminals, retired soldiers, lesser aristocrats seeking new subjects to lord over - they each had their reasons pushing them from Yanshen and pulling them to the [Root.GetAreaName] district of [Root.GetRegionName]. The natives of the region, displeased to find foreigners occupying the lands and houses of their fathers and brothers felled by [Root.Owner.GetName]’s armies, greatly outnumbered these first settlers, who had to rely on those very armies for protection.\n\nIn the years since, we have been able to compel the natives’ obedience without holding them at gunpoint. We have opened compulsory schools to teach our language and culture to their children, and given stipends to local men and women who marry into Yan families. We have banned the use of the [Root.Culture.GetName] language in commerce and religious ceremonies, and have curtailed [Root.Culture.GetName] celebrations and festivals, replacing them with Yan equivalents. Most importantly, the first Yan children born in [Root.GetName] have grown into adulthood and begun families of their own. The Office of Integration has dispatched a memorandum to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName], reporting that census records and tax rolls show these nativeborn Yan and recent arrivals from the heartland now constitute the majority of [Root.GetName]’s population."

 bianfang.301.t:0 "The Rise of the Shuokyuan"
 bianfang.301.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has set out on a Royal Tour of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Northern Territories, accompanied by an entourage of Marshals and court dignitaries eager to see the rugged steppes of Shuvüüshudi and picturesque river valleys of Odheongun. Crossing over the Black Mist Hills in the shadow of Dragon Peak, they come to the wide prairies that once hosted vast flocks of wild terrorbirds. The mounts of the Faceless Queen and her hordes, now they are nothing more than heaps of skeletons piled on the plains or curiosities corralled on the estates of Yan aristocrats. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had the pleasure of feasting on roast terrorbird at the estate of one such aristocrat on the shores of Dakilbege Núk. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] takes note that the aristocrat’s servants carving and plating the beast speak perfect Yan, with a slight rural twang.\n\nFloating down the Kongniaohe to the northern bastion of Jiantsiang, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entourage board a squadron of ships bound for the great port of Buogoj. Once the heart of the isolationist Odheongun, the city has now opened to ships from Yanshen and beyond, evidenced by the sprawling complex housing the harbormaster’s office. Touring the city’s famed schools, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is pleased to find that the instruction for budding bureaucrats is being given in the local Yan dialect. The province’s Marshal relates to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as they share a pot of tea that the local youngsters in Odheongun and the old lands Shuvüüsh have begun referring to themselves as Shuokyuan, claiming both their old heritage and a new Yan identity."

 bianfang.302.t:0 "The Growth of the Naamzau"
 bianfang.302.d:0 "A new dish has made its debut in the palace kitchens of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] - rich horseflesh from the plains of Thidnikai, layered over tender rice from that land’s bountiful paddies, seasoned with sublime Sikai salt, all wrapped up in fragrant tea leaves from the Zyujyut gardens. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has recently taken a keen interest in the vibrant culture of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] southern subjects. A tapestry depicting the ancient Bom forts, restored with Yan-style crenellations and towers, hangs prominently in the Southwest Great Hall. Minstrels sing bawdy tunes during the palace’s late night soiree’s, with lyrics from the Flower Boats of the Zyusipgang sung over traditional melodies and instruments of Kai herdsman. Even the rare Sun Elf and Nephrite Dwarf have found their place at court, now intriguing subjects of the Dragon Throne instead of enemy and foreign.\n\nThese are not just examples of a mere passing royal fad, but indicators of a genuinely new Yan culture emerging on the other side of the Phokhao. The Naamzau, the Yan of the Southlands, have sunk their roots and spread their tendrils along every branch and tributary of the Telebai, Hukai, and Khom Ma. With each one, the White Dragon roosts ever more firmly in the south."
 bianfang.302.a:0 "Splendid. Pass the horse."
 bianfang.303.t:0 "The Landing of the Pinghoi"
 bianfang.303.d:0 "For centuries, Yan merchants have maintained a presence in the Ringlet Sea, ushering trade from the Gulf of Rahen to Yanshen proper. Arawkelin’s Yan Quarter sprung up nearly as soon as Jaher’s fleeing legionnaires made the port town their bastion. These merchants were joined by their less savory brethren - pirates - when the Dread Queen of Pinghoi led her armada south after annihilating the Feiten fleet in 1438 AA, a martial feat much admired by Xinzhu Long. The Pinghoi buccaneers went on to achieve similar success against Arawkelin and Khom, from whom they seized the great harbor of Cây Cam Sinh.\n\nDe facto rule has a way of producing de jure legitimacy, so when we conquered the seas and jungles of the south, we chose to elevate these local Yan to positions of power. Their absolute loyalty would be assured through our shared language and history, and through [Root.GetName]’s armies being the only protection they had against the local populace ill inclined to see reavers become rulers.\n\nThe dao, the jian, and plenty of musket balls have indeed been needed to pacify the islanders and jungle dwellers of the far south, but less so each year as boats of settlers from Yanshen proper float up the Jantug Kala or dock in the Ringlet Islands. Away from the strictures of Yanshen proper, these now arrivals quickly adopt the old pirates’ loose dress, hodgepodge weapons, and ad hoc sense of propriety. These ‘New Pinghoi’ are barely more civilized than the natives over which they’ve come to rule, or so complains the Marshal of Arawkelin in an indignant letter to the Office of Integration. However, their efficacy in taming the interior and its inhabitants has been illustrated in the rapid decline in rebellions in the interior and booming trade from these districts. Great forests of teak have been clearcut to make way for rice paddies, the timber floated downriver to our mills and workshops. Exotic animals have found their place in the homes and kitchens of aristocrats - colorful birds, terrifying snakes, and succulent arachnids. Even five of the exquisite women of Tlagapatung arrived in the Imperial Harem, gifts from the local chieftain. Uncouth as they may be, these Pinghoi have been hard at work bringing Yanshen to the Far South, and the Far South to Yanshen."

 bianfang.304.d:0 "The imperial flotilla, decked out with a pomp and verve expected for a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], has plied its way up the Yanhe to tour the great libraries of North Rahen. [Root.Monarch.GetName]. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recently become something of a bookworm, and is eager to see the innumerable rolls of books, scrolls, manuscripts of all sorts, many dating back far before the foundations of Bianfang were rooted in the earth. A very recent addition to each library [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] visited, however, was an official chapter house administered by the Office of Integration. In them, scores of budding bureaucrats skilled in Raheni scripts and tongues spend their hours meticulously translating the texts into Yan, to be dispatched to the imperial presses in [Root.Capital.GetName] for printing and distribution to the literati (with appropriate censorship, of course). One such text, a treatise on rulership written over five centuries ago, had piqued [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s interest in the first place.\n\nOn their leisurely parade back to the pleasure boats, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s entourage is followed by joyous youths, throwing multicolored flower petals at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet. They shout words of praise and adulation in fluent Yan, with a novel lilt and trill, sprinkled with unfamiliar words. The District Chancellor informs [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that these youths are the children of Yansheni newcomers and Raheni commoners, who were liberated from the so called lower castes by right of intermarriage, and are now free to enjoy the prosperous life of corvee labor and military service of a [Root.GetName] citizen. Their dialect is called Luoxian, the Chancellor says, and is spoken by [Root.GetName]’s Raheni subjects of all stations, from cowherds to scholars of High Philosophy. Indeed, he is proven to be right several months later when [Root.Monarch.GetName] sits in on a meeting of the Cinnabar Lotus Society in Endhuvi, and finds the dialect serving as a common vernacular for the scholars hailing from all corners. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is pleased to find a contingent of Ascendant Soul scholars from Tianlou out-argue a group from the School of the Starry Eye, both sides engaging in Luoxian. Two months later, luxuriating in the Ruby Gardens of Parusad Bhola, surrounded by the Raheni elite clad in silk from the Yanhe, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ears are again graced by this new dialect, as vibrant and bright as the land from which iti came."
