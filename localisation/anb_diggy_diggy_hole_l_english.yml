  diggy.1.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Hold"
  diggy.1.d:0 "After many years of effort, we have finally finished the new districts of our Hold. This feat of architecture and engineering offers us many opportunities for expansion in the future."
  diggy.1.a:0 "[Root.strikeTheEarth] strike the [Root.swearAtTheEarth] earth!"
  
  diggy.2.t:0 "Demands of Labour"
  diggy.2.d:0 "With the construction of our Hold continuing, one cannot help but think it could be done at a faster pace. Though it may be quite an expensive undertaking, if we were to devote yet more of our nation's resources to meeting the various demands of construction, we could surely have our hold completed in record time!"
  diggy.2.a:0 "Construction is paramount, no matter the cost"
  diggy.2.b:0 "Everything seems to be fine as it is"
  
  diggy.3.t:0 "A Beautiful Hold"
  diggy.3.d:0 "With continual advancements of hold construction in [Root.GetName], several prominent members of our more artistic community: artists, stonecarvers, and various others, have brought a proposal to the forefront. As a demonstration of our culture, they say, our hold too must in and of itself be a work of art. To implement this would surely take large amounts of time and resources away from other projects, but perhaps, like all art, true beauty is worth the price?"
  diggy.3.a:0 "Let us build a beautiful hold"
  diggy.3.b:0 "Operations will continue as before"
  
  diggy.4.t:0 "Military Labourers"
  diggy.4.d:0 "Though many are willing to work to construct our great hold, there are limited numbers of those willing to work. Yet, it seems that we have a vast, untapped labour supply in the form of our army. Using military personnel for construction would certainly help the process, but our generals worry about the impact this move could have on our military readiness. So, we must choose our priorities: our hold, or our army?"
  diggy.4.a:0 "Our army is worthless if it has nothing to defend"
  diggy.4.b:0 "Our hold is worthless if there is no one to defend it"
  
  diggy.5.t:0 "Apatite Layer"
  diggy.5.d:0 "Apatite is best known for its use as an index mineral, with a hardness of 5 in the Dwohs Hardness Scale. It is usually green in color, but can be yellow, brown, blue, purple, pink, or colorless. These colors are often so vivid that apatite has frequently been cut as a gemstone. Apatite is a brittle material. It breaks by both fracture and cleavage, but the cleavage is generally indistinct.\n\nWe've faced such a mineral while digging, should we keep digging through it?"
  diggy.5.a:0 "OF COURSE!"
  diggy.5.b:0 "We can't handle the cost, let's find another way"
  
  diggy.6.t:0 "Orthoclase Layer"
  diggy.6.d:0 "Orthoclase is a feldspar mineral, one of the most abundant rock-forming minerals of the continental crust. Orthoclase is most widely encountered as the pink feldspar found in many granites and is assigned a hardness of "6" in the Dwohs hardness scale.\n\nOur brave miners have encountered such a mineral while digging, what should we do?"
  diggy.6.a:0 "We shall not slow down!"
  diggy.6.b:0 "Let's find another path"
  
  diggy.7.t:0 "Iron Pyrite Layer"
  diggy.7.d:0 "Pyrite is a brass-yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster, and is the most common sulfide mineral. It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs, usually in small quantities, in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks worldwide. Pyrite is so common that many dwarven geologists would consider it to be an ubiquitous mineral. Such a material is now in our way."
  diggy.7.a:0 "No Pyrite shall block our way!"
  diggy.7.b:0 "Try to dig through another path"
  
  diggy.8.t:0 "Spinel Layer"
  diggy.8.d:0 "Spinel is an oxide mineral (7.5 to 8 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale) and is often found in octahedral crystals. It is typically found in three geologic situations: As crystals in limestones and dolomites that have been subjected to contact metamorphism; as irregularly-shaped grains in basic igneous rocks; and as water-worn pebbles in alluvial deposits. It seems we have found a huge deposit of it in the way of our digging operations."
  diggy.8.a:0 "What's the problem? Dig through it!"
  diggy.8.b:0 "Maybe we should rethink our strategy..."
 
  diggy.9.t:0 "Corundum Layer"
  diggy.9.d:0 "Corundum is a rock-forming mineral that is found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, with a value of 9 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale. The mineral is widely known for its extreme hardness and for the fact that it is sometimes found as beautiful transparent crystals in many different colors. The extreme hardness makes corundum an excellent abrasive, and when that hardness is found in beautiful crystals, you have the perfect material for cutting gemstones.\n\nWe've encountered a massive layer of it. How should we proceed ?"
  diggy.9.a:0 "Nothing shall stop us."
  diggy.9.b:0 "Maybe if we go a little more to the left..?"
  
  diggy.10.t:0 "Carbonadwo Layer"
  diggy.10.d:0 "Carbonadwo diamonds are a rare and unusual variety of diamond. When found in the field, they look nothing like any other type of diamond. They are dark, opaque, porous, and often display a subtle luster. They are composed almost entirely of microcrystalline diamonds in random crystallographic orientations. The name "black diamond" is sometimes used for carbonadwo, however that name should technically be reserved for diamonds with a black body color caused by clouds of tiny black inclusions or by carbonization of fracture surfaces.\n\nThis is the hardest layer we've ever encountered, a 10 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale."
  diggy.10.a:0 "Finally, a worthy opponent!"
  diggy.10.b:0 "I don't want our battle to be legendary..."
  
  diggy.11.t:0 "Having a Blast"
  diggy.11.d:0 "Several mining engineers have come to us over the last few days with a single word on their minds: explosives. We aren't sure how safe these explosives are, or even how our engineers even got their hands on them, but they assure us that these will surely speed up the construction of our hold. The engineers in question do seem quite eager, perhaps a little too eager..."
  diggy.11.a:0 "How could this possibly go wrong?"
  diggy.11.b:0 "What do you mean, "technically safe"?"
  
  diggy.12.t:0 "Restoration of [Root.GetName]"
  diggy.12.d:0 "After many years of work, [Root.GetName] has been restored to its former glory! We have faced many trials and tribulations, but surely, with the hold functioning once more, we will be able to truly build our nation up, or in this case down, towards a better tomorrow!"
  diggy.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"
  
  diggy.13.t:0 "Capture of [Root.GetName]"
  diggy.13.d:0 "The battle for [Root.GetName] was long and harsh, and many noble warriors died. The fierce battle that took place has severely damaged the hold, but it's nothing that cannot be repaired in the long run."
  diggy.13.a:0 "Such is the nature of war"
  
  diggy.14.t:0 "Gas Explosion"
  diggy.14.d:0 "A spark. A single damned spark. That was all that it took for the gas pocket to ignite, and our entire shaft to explode. The tunnel has since collapsed, and our miners have, unfortunately, died, as there was nowhere near enough warning for them to evacuate."
  diggy.14.a:0 "Damn it!"
  
  diggy.15.t:0 "Ancient Treasure"
  diggy.15.d:0 "As the rock fell away, our miners saw a most wondrous sight. An ancient chamber, full to the brim with ancient Dwarven relics, dating all the way back to the time of Aul-Dwarov. But even more importantly, they seem to be made out of pure, solid gold!"
  diggy.15.a:0 "Melt them down!"
  diggy.15.b:0 "Create a Museum"
  diggy.15.c:0 "Surely this can't be it? Dig deeper!"
  diggy.15.e:0 "It may be best to leave them be..."
  
  diggy.16.t:0 "An Old Hold"
  diggy.16.d:0 "As the stone crumbles away, a sight is revealed to our miners unlike anything else. An entire abandoned Hold, deep underground, entirely lost to time! The idea of exploring this new hold is popular, especially amongst local adventurers, as it promises adventure, danger, glory, insight into the past, and most importantly, treasure! Some, however, warn against it, and worry of the dangers that this hold could present to our people."
  diggy.16.a:0 "For trea- I mean, for adventure!"
  diggy.16.b:0 "Perhaps it was abandoned for a reason..."
  
  diggy.17.t:0 "Cave Collapse!"
  diggy.17.d:0 "A single loose beam was all that it took for our mineshaft to come crashing down, with scores of miners buried alive underneath vast tonnes of rock. Our mining efforts have been set back, and their families have been informed of the loss. Though tragic, this will surely be only one accident amongst many in the name of our hold's progress."
  diggy.17.a:0 "We must continue!"
  
  diggy.18.t:0 "Soft Rock"
  diggy.18.d:0 "It seems that fortune smiles upon us, as our miners have come to a section of rock that seems to almost melt away upon striking. Our mining efforts continue well above schedule, and this will surely help with our hold's continued expansion."
  diggy.18.a:0 "Keep up the good work!"
  
  diggy.19.t:0 "Blood and Sweat"
  diggy.19.d:0 "Our miners have come across rock that, itself, breaks all but the strongest of mining equipment. And yet, our determined brethren continue. Through pain, they mine. Through sweat, they mine. Through sheer force of will, they mine."
  diggy.19.a:0 "Rise through willpower!"
  
  diggy.20.t:0 "Two Miners, One Magical Mineral"
  diggy.20.d:0 "Word has reached us of a great discovery! In one of the many tunnels that snake their way through our hold, two miners have come across a vast deposit of the magical mineral, damestear — a main ingredient in all things magic from artificery to enchantments. Up until this point they have been speaking almost in unison, but soon, the two begin bickering. Eventually, the first miner speaks, and says that the damestear must be mined and exploited for the benefit of our great nation, and would surely bring great riches. The second, however, raises her voice, and loudly proclaims that mining damestear would, rather than riches, bring great danger, and not be worth the risk to extract."
  diggy.20.a:0 "Great riches, you say?"
  diggy.20.b:0 "Safety first."
  
  diggy.21.t:0 "Damestear Explosion"
  diggy.21.d:0 "The ground trembles. Walls shake. Rubble falls loose from the cavern roof. The screams of those still in the mines reverberate across the hold. A single note sits before you. It contains but four words: 'I told you so'."
  diggy.21.a:0 "Why me?"
  
  diggy.22.t:0 "Goblin Ambush"
  diggy.22.d:0 "Miners enter a cavern. Beyond the light of their torches, there is only darkness. They tread carefully, wary of disturbing any traps that may be lying there. The cavern is silent, but for the soft crackling of their torches. Then—arrows fly. The torches clatter to the ground, and are snuffed upon the cold stone floor. For a few seconds, there is naught but darkness. And then, in an instant, the darkness is pierced by the glow of hundreds of glowing yellow eyes."
  diggy.22.a:0 "Ready your weapons!"
  
  diggy.23.t:0 "Orcish Opposition"
  diggy.23.d:0 "As the walls fall away, a fearsome sight stands to greet us: a cavern filled to the brim with hostile orcs. In an instant, battle breaks out. We immediately sent down reinforcements, but the orcs seem to somehow continue to swell in number."
  diggy.23.a:0 "Stand your ground!"
  
  diggy.24.t:0 "Beautiful Cavern"
  diggy.24.d:0 "Upon first inspection, the cavern appears to be like any other, a small opening within the mountain, filled with air rather than earth. But only upon first inspection. For once you enter the cavern, its truly wondrous properties become apparent. The walls seem to be entirely encrusted with crystals! When light is shone upon them, they reflect light in such a way as to create a complete tapestry of light, winding, twirling, and shifting as the light sources move. This may be the closest that we ever get to true beauty."
  diggy.24.a:0 "How much do you think those crystals are worth?"
  diggy.24.b:0 "Open the cavern to all! For a price, of course..."
  
  diggy.25.t:0 "Beautiful Cavern Profits"
  diggy.25.d:0 "Across our hold, people flock to see the wondrous cavern we have discovered! Commoners and elites alike are left dumbstruck by the beauty of the changing and shifting patterns of the lights. It has inspired many pieces in our hold's more artistic community, but even the artists themselves agree that they cannot truly recapture the beauty of the cavern itself."
  diggy.25.a:0 "Superb!"
  diggy.25.b:0 "Eureka!"
  spark_tooltip:0 "§G[Root.Monarch.GetName] has suddenly had a spark of genius!\nWhile some in the country don't understand and critize [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ideas, it look like great things are to come...§! "
  
  diggy.26.t:0 "Unstable Foundations"
  diggy.26.d:0 "The stone seems to split and crack, as an entire section of our hold, brand new, sinks deep into the mountain. Upon investigation, it appears that the specific structures were built upon an underground river, and with enough construction and erosion, the stone simply could not hold. Fortunately, those who were present at the time were able to be rescued, and although there were many injuries, there were thankfully no deaths."
  diggy.26.a:0 "Who approved this?"
  
  diggy.27.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Hold Specialization"
  diggy.27.d:0 "As our hold progresses ever deeper into the earth it has come to our attention that, like in the days of Aul-Dwarov, a hold must specialize to witness its true potential. From now on, [Root.GetName] must decide to focus on a certain aspect, based on what natural resources and opportunities the hold has available.\n\nWill it focus on the infrastructure of a foundry hold, full of conveyors, tracks and great forges to out-scale any other metal production? Perhaps infrastructure to maintain an even higher population? A Metropolis? Houses stacked upon houses carved upon the walls of the Dwarovar where city and commercial business can flourish alike. Maybe a hold to focus on the finer arts? A hold beautifully crafted with elegant architecture to please and inspire our master artisans and crafters. Or might it even have the infrastructure to support vast vertical farms, so that our hold will be green with plant life to feed our people? Or perhaps the hold will lean towards military matters, with large fortifications and massive roads so as to defend ourselves against outsiders, both above and below?\n\nOnly time will tell what our hold with specialize in."

  diggy.28.t:0 "News of an Orc Warband"
  diggy.28.d:0 "Armies move quickly in the mountains, but news moves quicker. Messengers come to us with a single, dire warning: an orc warband approaches our territory. With it, comes the tide of war."
  diggy.28.a:0 "We must prepare for the coming storm"
  
  diggy.29.t:0 "Warband Arrives"
  diggy.29.d:0 "Our lands have, once again, been attacked by a vast orc warband. The coming battle will be harsh, but we can, nay, we must pull through! These orcs would see us slaughtered, but it is not us who shall be dying this day!"
  diggy.29.a:0 "To arms!"
  
  diggy.30.t:0 "Serpentsmite"
  diggy.30.d:0 "Is this the end? The mountains themselves seem to roar with rage, as an earthquake unlike any seen in living memory shakes our hold to its very core. Great cracks form in the rock, swallowing buildings whole, and rubble falls from above, shattering structures and burying citizens alive. For a full hour, the quake continues, reaping ever more damage as the seconds go by. And then, just as suddenly as it began, it ceases. The damage is immense, and many of our resources are taken up simply keeping our hold in one piece. Now, however, a choice lies before us; this great quake, which split open the core of our hold, has revealed many precious minerals that were previously undiscovered. Due to the unstable nature of the fissures, access to these minerals will likely be short-lived. We could devote effort to harvesting these resources, but this would surely take away from the efforts to rescue and treat survivors."

  diggy.32.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Under Attack!"
  diggy.32.d:0 "A vast horde of Cave Goblins have attacked [Root.GetName]! Already our defenses are being put to the test, though they will not hold forever. If we are to destroy this menace, decisive action must be taken in the defence of our hold."
  diggy.32.a:0 "Kill them all!"
  
  diggy.33.t:0 "[Root.GetName] is Being Ambushed!"
  diggy.33.d:0 "A vast horde of Black Orcs have ambushed [Root.GetName]! Though we were caught off-guard, our defences are already coming through, despite some initial tactical setbacks. If we are to truly destroy this menace, however, decisive action must be taken in the defence of our hold."
  diggy.33.a:0 "Prepare our best troops!"

  CavernOfInterest_1:0 "Our miners have stumbled upon one of the most beautiful sights a Dwarf can see: a cache of gold! We cannot be sure its provenance, as any inscriptions or inventory details have faded. Perhaps this is the loot of a long-deceased raiding party, or the treasury of some abandoned Hold, or even a relic of old Aul-Dwarov itself. No matter now—it will be casted down, stamped with our coinage, and put to better use."
  CavernOfInterest_2:0 "Swords. Spears. Maces. Bows, and Crossbows. And axe-heads, the sole remnant of once-mighty arms whose handles have long-since rotted away. All those and more litter the floor of the cavern. Some bear bloodstains—so caked on it is hard to distinguish from rust - while others seem nearly pristine, and some even bear decorative inlays. It is not clear exactly who left these here, or why, but we will ensure these long-idle arms have their day once more."
  CavernOfInterest_3:0 "When our miners made their way into the cavern, it seemed nondescript. But when one of them leaned against the wall, only to recoil at its frigid touch, that illusion was quickly dispelled. Every wall of this cave seems adorned in Mithril, the mineral belying its extreme rarity with its abundance in this cave. We have never seen the like, and already there are debates over whether such a phenomenon might be the aftermath of some Precursor Relic or an old technology of Aul-Dwarov. Certainly, once our extraction facilities are set up, it is likely to usher in a never-before-seen age of mithril craftsmanship in our nation."
  CavernOfInterest_4:0 "The first mining party sent into the cavern did not return. Neither did the second, nor the third. It was only with the fourth that survivors made it back to inform us of what we had discovered: a vast horde of wild orcs, laying concealed in ambush. We must avenge our fallen miners, and teach these brutes that the Dwarovar is ours—to arms!"
  CavernOfInterest_5:0 "We have stumbled on a very strange, and very old, relic in this cavern: an abandoned rail-car from the old Dwarovar network! The inscription of Er-Natvir train inspectors attests to its suitability for service, though how such a train-car got here, when there are no rails in sight, boggles the mind. While we will have to leave that mystery to the most eccentric of our historians, one thing is clear: the train must have been part of some complex trade deal, and we will happily take the assorted minerals and resources within for our own."
  CavernOfInterest_6:0 "The cavern is vast and empty, except for at its very center, where lays a small yet ornate mausoleum. We shall not disturb whomever lays within: perhaps they are some great dwarf, perhaps they are one of the few goblins who garnered such a resting place, perhaps they are someone else entirely. We shall take it merely as a reminder of all the greatness that has passed before — greatness we may claim one day in turn."
  CavernOfInterest_7:0 "Those eyes. Those damned eyes. Like torches in the dark, like blood splattered on silver. The last survivor of our expedition may never forget them, and be haunted by their memory and by whispers in the dark until the day she dies. But we have more important matters, closer to hand—like avenging every miner who fell to this ambush!"
  CavernOfInterest_8:0 "In a corner of this cavern we have come across an abandoned caravan with a design unlike any we have seen before, and we looking closer, we discovered why—this is no ordinary transporter of goods or resources, but rather one of the many carts that would carry the latest updates from Dûr-Vazhatun out to the wider world. It is said that across the Dwarovar, and indeed across all Halann, the arrival of one of these carts would upend the lives of every local philosopher and scientist. Whether Dûr-Vazhatun was disproving an old theory, elevating a new hypothesis, or remarking on a truly extraordinary discovery, every new delivery meant another step forward in our understanding of the world. And while the pages and arguments within may be centuries old, it is clear they are having something of a similar effect on our own knowledge-seekers."
  CavernOfInterest_9:0 "We have come upon a site unlike any other in the Dwarovar. This temple, if you can call it that, bears crude pictures of the Dookan etched on the cavern walls, along with an altar either rusted or bloodstained. It is clear evidence of an organized religion, and we shudder to imagine what rituals priests may have carried out in such a domain. There is one oddity, though—why does one corner of the temple bear a set of manacles, still faintly glowing with old and powerful enchantments..?"
  CavernOfInterest_10:0 "A strange scholar has long argued that mushrooms are the greatest hope for our future—or the source of our downfall, if we do not heed his words (and fund his research). Let's make sure not to alert him to our most recent discovery: a vast cavern full of mushrooms of every shape, colour, size, and taste. That said, we should make sure to bring this to the attention of our fungi farmers, because such a cavern could very well be exactly what we need to feed our growing population."
  CavernOfInterest_11:0 "In our explorations of the Dwarovar, skeletons are not an uncommon find. Nor are weapons, of all material and make. But never before have we encountered both in the sheer quantity that litter this cavern. We must have stumbled upon some ancient, massive, battlefield. The mind can scarce imagine how much blood flowed over this cavern floor, and how many fought and died with the same stalactites looming above them as we see now. We cannot even be sure exactly who fought here—dwarf bones mix with orcish mix with goblin mix with elven—and there are also those stranger still, which bear no resemblance to any creature we know. Still, every bone bears the same reminder: though it is good to die in battle, it is better still for your enemy to do so!"
  CavernOfInterest_12:0 "We've found nothing. Absolutely nothing. The cavern is empty, extremely empty, extraordinarily empty. It feels empty even with our mining party's intrusion, as if before they entered it, it was some emptiness-beyond-empty. How strange—wait, no, nothing is less strange in Dwarovar than an empty cavern. On to the next!"
  CavernOfInterest_13:0 "The cavern was—is—unexciting. Some stalagmites and stalactites, a few promising mineral seams that led nowhere. We were about to write it off as just yet another cavern in the infinite array of such that can be found in the Dwarovar, when a miner dropped her pickaxe down a hole. And never heard a sound, though she listened for minutes on end. There doesn't seem to be any practical use to such a hole, except perhaps as waste disposal, but it is a reminder to us all of just how deep the Dwarovar goes. And how deep we may go in the years to come."
  CavernOfInterest_14:0 "All who walk the Dwarovar know of Hehogrim the Diligent, legendary architect of the Holds, but it appears that even in Hehodovar he was not always working with minds quite his equal. Or such is the only conclusion we can draw from the discovery of his 'Digging for Dummies', yellowed pages wrapped in beaten leather tucked behind a boulder in the corner of a cavern. It seems a comprehensive guide to the architecture, engineering, and artisanry necessary to dig out and expand high-quality holds. It will surely be of great use as we deepen our nation—now if only we could decipher what he is talking about towards the end, when he reverses his direction of inquiry entirely and starts rambling about ascension..."
  CavernOfInterest_15:0 "Most commanders would describe battle as an art, a dance of move and counter-move, each side vying for the lethal upper hand. But it seems one scholar in Haraz Orldhûm thought instead to prove it a science, or at least we assume such from the discovery of a thick tome entitled 'Killing Orcs: An Introduction' in a corner of the cavern. It seems to to outline every conceivable combination of terrain, soldiers, weaponry, and strategic aim, and provide the single ideal tactical path forward. We will have to have our generals study it, to see whether the nameless scholar succeeded in his goal—or if such outlandish ideas are part of what lead Aul-Dwarov to fall in the first place."
  CavernOfInterest_16:0 "Everyone who explores the Dwarovar has their own reason for doing so. Some seek relics of the past, while others seek future glory. Some seek vengeance, imagined or otherwise, while others seem to cast about for their own absolution. But the most common, and indeed perhaps the true aim of many who profess another, is wealth—and face to face with the enormous cache of gold we discovered in this cavern, one can see why it appeals!"
  CavernOfInterest_17:0 "It all just... crumbled away. The floor of the cavern, which dropped out below the exploratory team just as they were finishing setting up their equipment. The hope of the few miners who saw it happen, who felt fingers brush their own as their friends and colleagues plummeted to their doom. And perhaps some of the confidence of our nation, as we faced this grim reminder that in the Dwarovar, every step can be your last."
  CavernOfInterest_18:0 "Skulls are common in the Dwarovar. But skulls such as the one we discovered in this cavern, adorned in gold and silver, with rubies inlaid as teeth and sapphires as eyes, are not. Why an orc's head was preserved this way is far beyond our comprehension—perhaps a ritual forgotten now even by the most learned of shamans. Such a relic will make an excellent discussion piece for the audience room of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and it's not like the gems can shift as if watching you... Can they?"
  CavernOfInterest_19:0 "The Dwarovar is not an easy place to make our fortunes in, nor to make our futures in. It is blood and steel and darkness and peril, a fiend that seems to push you one step upward for every one you descend. It is enough to make one despondent—which is why it is important to appreciate caverns like the one we discovered, where a simple yet serene beauty reminds us of just what we fight for."
  CavernOfInterest_20:0 "In the cavern, there was an alcove. In the alcove, there was a shadow. In the shadow, there was a box. And in the box, there was a book.\n\nIn faded runes, it bears what must be in the sigil of Hehodovar. And inside, is enough information to make a man go mad... with ambition, for what we might forge the Dwarovar into."

If they are to be believed, they have been hiding in the deepest parts of the hold for at least a century now, using guerilla tactics to fight off goblin search parties and other predators.

In every Hold, a second flag rose to adorn proud walls, to match the great banner of Aul-Dwarov already flapping in the wind.\n\nEvery one of these flags had its own history, its own triumphs and failures. In recent centuries, it is the failures that loomed large. But now, as they unite once more, all Halann remembers the way they stood strong against the Ancient Precursor Empire, the way they invented techniques and mechanisms still beyond our comprehension.

For today, they will be discussing the one issue most near and dear to Dwarven hearts, and the bedrock of their most bitter disputes — coin.\n\nIt is time for Aul-Dwarov to decide its budgetary priority for the years to come. Some argue for a policy of economic expansion, devoting every week to come to the construction of new infrastructure, from the homes that house our people to the temples they pray in to the warehouses that store almost every good found in Halann. Others would instead focus on efficiency, ensuring that our assembly lines are operating at full capacity and minimizing waste products, to boost our output like never before. Some Holds, especially those in strategic positions along the Dwarven Rail, would have us focus not on the production of goods but their free flow throughout the Empire — they remind us that blood must be pumped through a body if it is to live. A fourth group turns their eyes not inward but outwards, and decries the way that Serpentspine gems and minerals flow across Halann as a looting of our realm, that must immediately be stopped.\n\nThe Amlharaz grants each Hold a vote — but at the day's end, it shall speak in a single voice.

Perhaps it is fitting more have brought their (ceremonial, yet sharp) axes and swords, for today the Amlharaz shall be deciding matters of blood, of steel, of fire. Today, the Amlharaz shall be discussing the Dwarven army.\n\nEach Hold has their own specialization when it comes to war, and in turn, each would see a different focus for Aul-Dwarov's forces. Some delegates hearken to the Greentide past, and would have our army grow to a size where it could match the Goblin and Orcish hordes. Others would pursue a policy of refurbishing the army's guns and improving its armour, which they promise shall forge our soldiers into a wall as unbreakable as those of any Hold. That argument almost leads to blows, however, as it faces vehement opposition from those that insist the age of basic soldiery must give way to an age of artillery. A few delegates, however, find all these arguments misguided at best, actively harmful at worst — it is not the quantity of soldiers or guns or cannons that matters, they say, but its quality.\n\nThe Amlharaz grants each Hold a vote — but at the day's end, it shall speak in a single voice.

His voice is quickly drowned out, however, by a faction who believes the bureaucracy must be expanded to properly administrate the growing Empire (and they note they have already drawn up the forms to do so). Opposing them in turn are the representative of Holds who would have our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] instead listen to those Dwarves of exceeding brilliance and skill, and grant them the authority to cut through seas of paperwork as they deem necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the Empire. Amidst the bickering, one Hold's representative sidles up to [Root.Monarch.GetName], and slyly suggests that if the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] were to devolve some taxation powers to the Holds, all this discord might just blow away.\n\nThe Amlharaz grants each Hold a vote — but at the day's end, it shall speak in a single voice.

Unfortunately in the course of his research, he deliberately infected himself with the Rot in order to view the results of his work, and though he could slow the disease, he could not halt it. Worse, besides the loss of one of our best minds, he was not able to properly explain his research before his untimely demise. His peers are already trying to decipher his notes."

  I21_nation_title:0 "Refound Tuwad-Dhûmakon"
  I21_nation_desc:0 "Known as the Second Domain, Tuwad-Dhûmakon was the child hold of the gargantuan Grônstunad. While often in the shadow of its mother, perhaps a new ruler can help this hold find its place in history."
  I22_nation_title:0 "Refound Grônstunad"
  I22_nation_desc:0 "Grônstunad, meaning the Jade Mine, served as the capital of the eastern jade dwarves, and was said to have rivaled Amldihr itself. It is said that in its early days it served as the eastern capital for Aul-Dwarov, but after the west's fall to orcish invasion Grônstunad flourished and became grander and more magnificent than Amldihr ever was. All good things must come to an end, however, and though for many years Grônstunad enjoyed its position in the world, everything changed when the hobgoblins attacked..."

  I24_nation_desc:0 "Aul-Dwarov. The Empire of the Dwarves. Literally known as All-Dwarves Home. Once the bastion of the ancient world, way before any sort of human or elf had any sort of urgency or glory.

Its inhabitants are known as Amber dwarves due to their proximity to the Tree of Stone, but in fact gain their yellowish tinge from the sulfur used in such weaponry. The cannon refineries of the hold lay quiet, until a true master of arms re-awakens them once again!"
  F47_nation_title:0 "Resurrect Verkal Gulan"
  F47_nation_desc:0 "The hold of Verkal Gulan was one of the few to survive the fall of the Segbandal. However in isolation its people became complacent and corrupt.

  H78_nation_title:0 "Resurrect Seghdihr"
  H78_nation_desc:0 "Known as Southgate, Seghdihr gained its prominence after the fall of the Dwarovar, and was the leader of the Segbandal (the Southern Alliance) which for a time maintained relative security in the Middle Dwarovar until its dissolution.

  H77_nation_desc:0 "Ovdal Lodhum was known as the Hold where Love Lives, and was known for its beautiful architecture and as a perfect honeymoon spot for newlywed dwarves of the old empire. After the fall, it was one of the few holds that survived—after all, love always prevails."

  H76_nation_desc:0 "The nominal capital of the Serpent's Reach, Arg-Ôrdstun was home to the proud and strong diamond dwarves who in their time often challenged the authority of the High King of Aul-Dwarov.

  blorc_desc_2863:0 "Khugdir's immense vaults once held enough wealth to begin one of the world's largest banks when its survivors fled from its fall, which still drives the economy of much of the far off Dameshead to this day. These vaults held artefacts and treasures beyond compare, including the legendary Gem of Asra, once belonging to the nearby and long-collapsed Asra Hold. Now the city holds no treasures but the vaults themselves and a vast gate leading out into Escann, for we have taken their many treasures and made them our own. Still it is a shame to have such vaults lie empty when they could be filled with the wealth of our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. Let us go out one more into these new lands, and fill all our lands with Orcish plunder."
  blorc_desc_2868:0 "Unlike the dwarvern forges found in other holds throughout the Serpentspine, the workshops and warehouses of Haraz Orldhum have their walls lined with shackles and chains to hold the slaves that worked them. Layer after layer, built by orc and goblin to hold their brethren in slavery to dwarven masters, as they were kept from the glory of combat and forced to labour for their master's enrichment. But they did now know how strong we are, and these slavers where gutted by orcs from within and without, those who survived being enslaved in turn to serve their true masters. Such a process must continue, with goblin and dwarf slaves now firing the ancient forges, and building the shackles we shall use to enslave all who oppose us."
  blorc_desc_4119:0 "We have fought the dwarves for so long, the days when they were actually organized together, rather than merely dying alone, are merely held in our shamans' myths. But we know this: when they were unified, they were unified under Amldihr.\n\nStill, those days are a relic now. A relic like the one we discovered in seizing Amldihr for our own: a well-worn crown, missing its gems, but made of some precious metal, enchanted with strange magics, and carved with the most ornate of runes. Whatever it once was, it shall now adorn the throne room of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName], a piece to remind all of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] dominance over the Serpentspine, and the orcs who rule it. It shall never, ever, be anything more than that."
  blorc_desc_4208:0 "The campaigns we led against the dwarves in the frigid wastes of their northernmost hold were long, arduous undertakings that brought the forces of our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to conflict with some of the most bloodthirsty and determined dwarves we've ever fought, cloaked in the almost servile cold that, at times, threatened to slow our unrelenting charge into their precious capital.\n\nThere is not much to behold of this place we have conquered, with its habitants barely more than the descendants of disgraced misfits and their meager hoards. Instead, we walk away with something infinitely more precious: the legacy of our triumph over the elements themselves."
  blorc_desc_4020:0 "The Hold of Dur-Vazhatun, once the scholarly center of the dwarves, has laid in ruins for millennia, rusting and decaying. Now, it has fallen into our hands, and within it, our armies found a vast amount of surprising discoveries. An amphitheatre, its purpose lost to time. A gigantic room, lined with shelves upon shelves of mostly useless books. Large workshops, filled with various things, contraptions of glass and tubes, various flasks, rusted machinery, gears, and cogs.  Most strange of all, at the top of the hold, a room of shattered glass and a rusted dome that opens onto the peak of the mountains. These damned dwarves have always used their books, guns, and machinery against us, and even when they are long gone, their incomprehensible machines often pose as obstacles blocking our goals. However, throughout these workshops and among the shelves of books, there are schematics and instructions, filled with helpful pictures, and not simply scratched in their cursed language. They contain information on how some of the decaying weapons and mysterious machinery found throughout the Dwarovar work. Armed with this knowledge, our glorious warband may find surviving in the detritus of this weak and demolished empire somewhat easier."
  blorc_desc_4147:0 "Plenty of dwarves would tell the stories of charges through the interior of the mountain, rams and riders clad in ramsteel and throwing back any orcish attempt at intrusion. Now with the taking of this hold we prove those tales a lie. Some of their stories still ring true though, especially those concerned with the taste of their mutton or the weight of their lambs and ewes. Whether stewed, roasted or boiled they make a fine delicacy, and help both our warriors and our young ones grow fast and strong. "
  blorc_desc_4236:0 "Honours and treasures aplenty always end up in the hands of those soldiers who first let foot inside of a newly conquered hold, whether due to ritual or circumstance. Here though the orcish vanguard was especially well rewarded as may of them claimed a set of mithril armour from the plundered remains of the captured armoury. Now as long as these orcs or their descendants serve in our armies the tip of every lance and the blade of every sword will be turned aside by our front-most troops, giving us still greater successes on the battlefield."
  blorc_desc_2931:0 "Er-Natvir, the center of the dwarovar, has long stood as an affront to the will of Dookan and the righteous mandate we hold over the dwarves. Like a failing heart, it pumped the necessary goods that kept the bleeding corpse that was Aul-Dwarov alive for as long as it did, defiant to keep itself and its vestigial holds alive, only to prolong its own suffering.\n\nHaving now conquered and are in full control of the heart and its assembly line, our forces have turned this dying heart into a working factory of orcish design, giving us the means necessary to run amok through its veins."
  blorc_desc_4056:0 "Verkal Kozenad was the first hold to fall when we burst out of Hul Jorkad and showed all the Serpentspine our might. Now we have again taken this old hold, and though our ancestors were quite successful in looting it, we have managed to find a few more trophies that they missed.\n\nIn particular is a collection of strange fluids and papers, tucked away in deep-buried alcove. Some testing by the orcs least-bloodied in its conquest showed the liquids are poisonous to drink, disgusting when used as a sauce — but priceless when used as ink for messages we would like to keep secret. We shall reserve this supply for the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s most important letters, and ensure none dare to poke their nose where it does not belong. "
  blorc_desc_2963:0 "The Dwarovar is ours, and orcs can be found across the Serpentspine. But if there is anything we share, anything that thrums through all of us, it is rooted in Hul-Jorkad. To own that hold, to ensure the dwarves are expunged from its halls, their mighty walls torn down and their deep dungeons destroyed, it somehow speaks to the very nature of every orc. And with that done, we shall be even more united in our Dookan-given purpose."
  blorc_desc_4238:0 "We had hardly held Orlghelovar a week, were still cleaning the shattered glass that littered its floors, when we spotted the first merchant caravan arriving. They did not look askance at the Hold's new occupants, and were quick to get to business.\n\nApparently, they hail from a city called Nathalaire, and consider it their god-given purpose to trade widely and freely. And they made clear to one of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s favored chieftains that whatever we had for sale, they'd be happy to take to market, no questions asked. It seems a very profitable partnership approaches!"
  blorc_desc_2942:0 "When we made our way into the marble hold of Shazstundihr, amidst broken statues and defaced marble arches we found a sight well-known to orcish eyes: the trappings of goblin residence. It was only when we first ventured outside the Hold into the blinding light of the nearby hills that we saw why: Goblins had been here, and had left, wisely leaving this abode and saving us the need to kill them for it.\n\nStill, this means we have opportunities aplenty in the surrounding lands. Perhaps the goblins have tribute they would be willing to offer to keep us away, perhaps even the humans can learn a similar relationship. And already there are whispers of even more we might learn, hints of a new purpose or meaning. Where these are coming from, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] does not know, but [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] does know that clearly there is much to be learned outside Shazstundihr's gates."
  blorc_desc_4093:0 "Amidst the heaving death of the empire of the dwarves, there was, for a time, a singular beacon of hope among the dwarves: Arg-Ordstun. Not even the most fanatical of our brethren, for a time, had the ability to break through its formidable defenses, forcing us back to retreat and rethink, time and time again. The dwarves of the place grew defiant, proud, comfortable even in the false pretense that — so long as the walls stood — Arg-Ordstun and her peoples were safe, even if it meant they were to be the last of their kind.\n\nOur defilation of this place was done with great prejudice and pleasure, the husk of this ruined hold serving as a reminder to all, orcs or otherwise, that it is not a case of if, but when we will bring all the Serpentspine to its knees"
  blorc_desc_4100:0 "Verkal Skomdihr was long tested as a fortress, facing countless attacks by the fey and so piling vaults high with powder and shot for each time they came to besiege the fortress. All that meant nothing when we arrived though, except that those same guns they were so proud of could be taken from their dead and wielded by proud orcs in our ever-growing army. Though we've taken trophies from every dwarfish band that broke before us this time we found huge warehouses piled high with ammunition, armouries stoked with spare rifles and beyond that... the Deepwoods themselves. Trees from which to carve new stocks, hunting grounds to give young ones practice and even a few pitiable orcs bleeding back in from the forest, chased from their homes and all too ready to die for us. More so than ever before, every orc in our empire shall be armed and ready to fight."
  blorc_desc_2973:0 "The conquest of Ovdal Lodhum left many a pink banner trampled in the mud. But they did fight fiercely, better-trained and with more discipline than most dwarves we had crushed before us. We forced our way through a tunnel inundated with burning pitch, savaged their forces that used strange crystal lights for tunnel fighting. They gave us no quarter, and were commendably brutal in their fighting — but they fell, like all dwarves shall before orcish blade.\n\nIt is only in seizing the Hold's deepest reaches did we begin to see the reason behind their impressive showing. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] came across, in a place of high honour, a blade blue steel stained deep with blood, a blade known to every orc, one that features in the scary stories we tell our children and even an adult's nightmares. The blade Orcrend, wielded by the one they call Trickster, who slew thousand upon thousand of orcs and never fell in turn to our axe or spear. It seems he was indeed a man, and not just a ghost or spectre, and must have settled in this hold.\n\nBut the time where orcs were killed is past, now it is time for orcs to do the killing. Orcrend shall be taken to an anvil, and hammered by the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] until it shatters. We have slain a nightmare, and all orcs shall breath easier for it."
  blorc_desc_4039:0 "The tunnels and caverns of the Serpentspine have always been hostile to orcs, the constrained spaces and desolate rock a good whetstone for our strength and fury. But never had we found a place where the land itself seemed to oppose our war as when taking Gor Burad.\n\nWe felt the heat as soon as we approached, but even then did not expect the lava moats, nor the furious dwarves. They took many orcs' lives, demanded a new approach, and for a moment [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] dispaired of conquering the Hold.\n\nBut only for a moment. Our fury and ferocity burns hotter than even molten rock; the Hold could not hold us off forever. And the lessons we learned in taking it shall ensure that all the others fall quicker as well."
  blorc_desc_4217:0 "After our capture of Gor Vazumbrog our horde were given permission to sack the hold. While such an opportunity is not rare, our warriors didn’t waste a moment in scouring the depth in hopes of finding anything of worth. What was found in the hold shocked us. The Skewered Drake clan is well known for having slain a Drake that once inhabited this hold, what was not known was they enslaved one of its children, using it’s to breed mounts and using its searing breath to fuel their furnaces.\n\nWe control Gor Vazumbrog, and with it we control this ancient drake."
  blorc_desc_4078:0 "No orc worthy of the name would ever admit to fearing a dwarf. Even the fiercest warriors among them might be respected, at most, and the nightmare of Orcbane is no dwarf at all, either a human or some haunting spectre.\n\nBut reports from the cleverest orcs, who [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] sent into the depths of Hehodovar, indicate that... perhaps... a dwarf has finally earned that designation. For in the Hold's oldest passageways, apparently, books and manuals have been found in a hand still legible, said to be the hand of the Hold's founder himself, Hehogrim. While normally we would burn any such relics, these refuse to catch alight. And from the ashen faces among the orcs who read those texts, the mind is brilliant and terrifying in its brilliance.\n\nThere is undoubtedly a lot to be learned from these works, even for us. But they must only be read by one of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors, never the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] — it would undoubtedly inspire an Ozarm'Chadash if [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] could credibly be said to fear any dwarf, and that might just happen if [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] looks upon Hehogrim's works directly."
  blorc_desc_4124:0 "Seghdihr, and the Segbandal they led, fought our ancestors to a stand-still as they tried to enter the Central Serpentspine. But we are not our ancestors: we are stronger, fiercer, tougher. We would ask the Citrine Dwarves if that has been made clear to them, but living ones are few and far between within the Hold's halls nowadays — corpses, of course, still litter the ground everywhere.\n\nWe will, however, undoubtedly see that truth in the eyes of those who deal with us, the cowardice of those would would oppose us — whatever stopped orcs before, wherever we were held back, it shall not survive the [Root.Owner.GetName] onslaught."
  blorc_desc_2914:0 "The Dwarovar is a rich land. And we have seized many riches in showing it the might of orcish fist and blade and bullet. But none compares to the treasury of Verkal Gulan, big enough that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] could be fully submerged within.\n\nIt is enough to give every soldier double the pay, fulfill the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s wildest dreams, with plenty left over. And as for that remainder's use? Well, already there are merchants at the Hero's Gates, willing to take any deal with the Hold's new conquerors for a piece of its riches. And now that we have coinage aplenty, we shall be able to do more than just bargain with them."
  blorc_desc_4218:0 "Many fortresses have fallen as we win the Serpentspine with tooth and claw and blade. This one, Gor Ozumbrog, would be just another in the list if it was not for its positioning on the eastern edge of the Serpentspine. One of our generals has remarked that it seems a halfway point, because of that: halfway through the Serpentspine, halfway to fulfilling our glorious Dookan-given destiny.\n\nIt serves as a reminder, too. So much has fallen before us — and we must not lose it in turn. So much has been taken, and must be kept. The enemies gates have fallen, ours must stand strong. Here in Gor Ozumbrog, and everywhere."
  blorc_desc_4247:0 "The guns of Ovdal Kanzad took their toll. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] knew they would went [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] sent the forces against its walls. The massive batteries that manned its gates produced booms that could be heard from leagues away, and the forces that ultimately took it had climbed over vast piles of orcish corpses to get there.\n\nBut the deed is done. Ovdal Kanzad has fallen. And we have learned a thing or two about enduring unrelenting cannonfire in the process."
  blorc_desc_4265:0 "As our armies marched into the vanquished Hold of Grozumdihr, they noticed a strange gate at its entrance, with Dwarven words inscribed in a strangely-lit green stone. It seemed not worth the effort to pry those jewels from their place, and so when one of the more learned shamans with some understanding of that strange tongue entered, she could decipher some of what it said.\n\nWhich revealed an odd discovery. Apparently our conquest was welcome? It was inevitable, of course, but the dwarves are strange to have invited it. Perhaps that is why they fell so easily.\n\nTheir seeming disposition did mean our looting was somewhat less violent than usual, which left a strange set of papers unburned, and unshredded. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has claimed them for [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], and only time will tell what [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] may learn from them."
  blorc_desc_4284:0 "Ovdal Az-An, the greatest goblin hold, has fallen. As the hold falls our orcs swarm the structure there seems to be an extra layer of savagery on top of the usual battle rage and the reason for this becomes quickly apparent. The goblins here had the audacity to keep our brethren as slaves, being forced to mine the depths of the hold.\n\nThe head of the goblin who ruled this hold is brought to our [From.Monarch.GetTitle], an immensely forgettable goblin but his head will serve as reminder to the enslaved remnants of their clan when they take our brothers' place in the mines."
  blorc_desc_4266:0 "The ale we've seized from the dwarves in our conquests has been hearty stuff, and rumor has that it is deadly to non-dwarves (and, apparently, non-orcs). But we, on the other hand, have been deadly to dwarves, and we need a brew that'll match that trait.\n\nNow that we control the distilleries of Hul-az-Krazakol, we can get to work on brewing such a drink. And if we give a sip or two to our warriors before battle (and a few more as reward if they fight well), we shall undoubtedly see a new level of fury expressed in our fighting."
  blorc_desc_4350:0 "For millennia we have forced goblins to serve orcish might, a generous reward when compared to simply slaughtering them and letting their blood water the Serpentspine's caverns. But in taking Tuwad-Dhumankon, and slaying its residents, we have seen evidence of a more concerted effort towards the enslaving of these creatures.\n\nA systematic hierarchy, detailed requirements and tribute payments, precise demands — clearly the Hobgoblins' similarity to their lesser brethren has forced them to be organized in the organization of their slavery. These should be even more effective when backed by orcish fury, ferocity, and steel, and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] will take a look over what we have found in the Hold to see what might be applied to the goblins that serve [Root.Owner.GetName]."
  blorc_desc_4311:0 "We are used to dominating the Dwarovar. Holds' wall fall before our onslaught, the dwarves are crushed into the ground they love, goblins left a green smear on cavern walls. But the hobgoblins? They reminded us why the Dwarovar is a place of blood and brutal battle, even for us orcs.\n\nTheir solid lines would not break before a mighty charge, even when most would turn and run. Their well-trained soldiers would not shatter before sword and axe and orcish might. Their discipline could withstand bloody losses, and not crumble.\n\nBut they fell, nonetheless. We have taken Gronstunad, the brightest of the Holds they rule. And all their solid forces, their impressive armies — well, it has just made an excellent whetstone on which to sharpen the blade of our troops."
  blorc_desc_4323:0 "At the easternmost end of the Serpentspine we have found the dwarves' most well-hidden hold, a bizarre place that unsettled the troops just from being inside it. Our warriors, upon storming the place, were lulled after their conquests into a sleep that was far from natural; with many warriors describing visions that ranged from the crumbling walls of structures that pierced the sky, to sandstorms of night-black sands billowing from the mountains and onto the thirsting earth.\n\nOur shamans took immediate interest in the hold and came to survey it, noting the change in behavior of the now permanent orc residents who seemed to be a more wary sort than the usual, citing their odd yet not unwelcome dreams as the source of their change. It appeared the root of the mystery, as with all things in the Dwarovar, was buried - this time in the depths of the unconscious mind. Upon rest, they came across something that would change them irreparably: a vision of an empty desolate room, and the sound of chains budging in the distance.\n\nThat vision was just the beginning however, debates of its meaning have begun to whip up the imagination of our shamans, now interested in uncovering the truths prophesized by the dreams that now live in the minds of the orcish people."

In a traditional sense it is a way for the have nots to take from the haves, a means for the strong youth to take from the decaying old. If an orc holds a title, a wife, an axe or even an entire tribe a challenger can duel them for it, risking both lives in the process. A Ozarm'Chadash (Duel For Honor in Orcish) is a fight to the death if the winner decides so, but the loser is occasionally spared by the victor, often for extra humiliation. \n\n In our case we are planning to challenge one of the minor chieftains occupying one of the decrepid holds in the periphery of our realm. These lesser chiefs who infest their holds never last long in their dog-eat-dog world, meaning they will not refuse, as that is surely the largest sign of weakness in orc society. \n\n Which chieftain do we challenge?"

As thousands of orcs gather outside the gate to see this duel between the past and the future, [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] sharpens their axe one last time."
