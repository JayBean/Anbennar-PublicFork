  diggy.12.d:0 "After many years of work, [Root.GetName] has been restored to its former glory! We have faced many trials and tribulations, but surely, with the hold functioning once more, we will be able to truly build our nation up, or in this case down, towards a better tomorrow!"
  diggy.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"

  diggy.13.t:0 "Capture of [Root.GetName]"
  diggy.13.d:0 "The battle for [Root.GetName] was long and harsh, and many noble warriors died. The fierce battle that took place has severely damaged the hold, but it's nothing that cannot be repaired in the long run."

  diggy.15.t:0 "Ancient Treasure"
  diggy.15.d:0 "As the rock fell away, our miners saw a most wondrous sight. An ancient chamber, full to the brim with ancient Dwarven relics, dating all the way back to the time of Aul-Dwarov. But even more importantly, they seem to be made out of pure, solid gold!"

  diggy.16.d:0 "As the stone crumbles away, a sight is revealed to our miners unlike anything else. An entire abandoned Hold, deep underground, entirely lost to time! The idea of exploring this new hold is popular, especially amongst local adventurers, as it promises adventure, danger, glory, insight into the past, and most importantly, treasure! Some, however, warn against it, and worry of the dangers that this hold could present to our people."
  diggy.16.a:0 "For trea- I mean, for adventure!"
  diggy.16.b:0 "Perhaps it was abandoned for a reason..."



  diggy.27.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Hold Specialization"
  diggy.27.d:0 "As our hold progresses ever deeper into the earth it has come to our attention that, like in the days of Aul-Dwarov, a hold must specialize to witness its true potential. From now on, [Root.GetName] must decide to focus on a certain aspect, based on what natural resources and opportunities the hold has available.\n\nWill it focus on the infrastructure of a foundry hold, full of conveyors, tracks and great forges to out-scale any other metal production? Perhaps infrastructure to maintain an even higher population? A Metropolis? Houses stacked upon houses carved upon the walls of the Dwarovar where city and commercial business can flourish alike. Maybe a hold to focus on the finer arts? A hold beautifully crafted with elegant architecture to please and inspire our master artisans and crafters. Or might it even have the infrastructure to support vast vertical farms, so that our hold will be green with plant life to feed our people? Or perhaps the hold will lean towards military matters, with large fortifications and massive roads so as to defend ourselves against outsiders, both above and below?\n\nOnly time will tell what our hold with specialize in."

  diggy.32.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Under Attack!"
  diggy.32.d:0 "A vast horde of Cave Goblins have attacked [Root.GetName]! Already our defenses are being put to the test, though they will not hold forever. If we are to destroy this menace, decisive action must be taken in the defence of our hold."
  diggy.32.a:0 "Kill them all!"

  diggy.33.t:0 "[Root.GetName] is Being Ambushed!"
  diggy.33.d:0 "A vast horde of Cave Goblins have ambushed [Root.GetName]! Though we were caught off-guard, our defences are already coming through, despite some initial tactical setbacks. If we are to truly destroy this menace, however, decisive action must be taken in the defence of our hold."
  diggy.33.a:0 "Prepare our best troops!"

  diggy.34.t:0 "Infested Assault"
  diggy.34.d:0 "The squatters of an Infested Hold have launched an assault against us! Once more, we must take up arms in defence of our nation, and for our very survival."

  CavernOfInterest_1:0 "Our miners have stumbled upon one of the most beautiful sights a Dwarf can see: a cache of gold! We cannot be sure its provenance, as any inscriptions or inventory details have faded. Perhaps this is the loot of a long-deceased raiding party, or the treasury of some abandoned Hold, or even a relic of old Aul-Dwarov itself. No matter now—it will be casted down, stamped with our coinage, and put to better use."
  CavernOfInterest_2:0 "Swords. Spears. Maces. Bows, and Crossbows. And axe-heads, the sole remnant of once-mighty arms whose handles have long-since rotted away. All those and more litter the floor of the cavern. Some bear bloodstains—so caked on it is hard to distinguish from rust - while others seem nearly pristine, and some even bear decorative inlays. It is not clear exactly who left these here, or why, but we will ensure these long-idle arms have their day once more."
  CavernOfInterest_3:0 "When our miners made their way into the cavern, it seemed nondescript. But when one of them leaned against the wall, only to recoil at its frigid touch, that illusion was quickly dispelled. Every wall of this cave seems adorned in Mithril, the mineral belying its extreme rarity with its abundance in this cave. We have never seen the like, and already there are debates over whether such a phenomenon might be the aftermath of some Precursor Relic or an old technology of Aul-Dwarov. Certainly, once our extraction facilities are set up, it is likely to usher in a never-before-seen age of mithril craftsmanship in our nation."
  CavernOfInterest_4:0 "The first mining party sent into the cavern did not return. Neither did the second, nor the third. It was only with the fourth that survivors made it back to inform us of what we had discovered: a vast horde of wild orcs, laying concealed in ambush. We must avenge our fallen miners, and teach these brutes that the Dwarovar is ours—to arms!"
  CavernOfInterest_5:0 "We have stumbled on a very strange, and very old, relic in this cavern: an abandoned rail-car from the old Dwarovar network! The inscription of Er-Natvir train inspectors attests to its suitability for service, though how such a train-car got here, when there are no rails in sight, boggles the mind. While we will have to leave that mystery to the most eccentric of our historians, one thing is clear: the train must have been part of some complex trade deal, and we will happily take the assorted minerals and resources within for our own."
  CavernOfInterest_6:0 "The cavern is vast and empty, except for at its very center, where lays a small yet ornate mausoleum. We shall not disturb whomever lays within: perhaps they are some great dwarf, perhaps they are one of the few goblins who garnered such a resting place, perhaps they are someone else entirely. We shall take it merely as a reminder of all the greatness that has passed before — greatness we may claim one day in turn."
  CavernOfInterest_7:0 "Those eyes. Those damned eyes. Like torches in the dark, like blood splattered on silver. The last survivor of our expedition may never forget them, and be haunted by their memory and by whispers in the dark until the day she dies. But we have more important matters, closer to hand—like avenging every miner who fell to this ambush!"
  CavernOfInterest_8:0 "In a corner of this cavern we have come across an abandoned caravan with a design unlike any we have seen before, and we looking closer, we discovered why—this is no ordinary transporter of goods or resources, but rather one of the many carts that would carry the latest updates from Dûr-Vazhatun out to the wider world. It is said that across the Dwarovar, and indeed across all Halann, the arrival of one of these carts would upend the lives of every local philosopher and scientist. Whether Dûr-Vazhatun was disproving an old theory, elevating a new hypothesis, or remarking on a truly extraordinary discovery, every new delivery meant another step forward in our understanding of the world. And while the pages and arguments within may be centuries old, it is clear they are having something of a similar effect on our own knowledge-seekers."
  CavernOfInterest_9:0 "We have come upon a site unlike any other in the Dwarovar. This temple, if you can call it that, bears crude pictures of the Dookan etched on the cavern walls, along with an altar either rusted or bloodstained. It is clear evidence of an organized religion, and we shudder to imagine what rituals priests may have carried out in such a domain. There is one oddity, though—why does one corner of the temple bear a set of manacles, still faintly glowing with old and powerful enchantments..?"
  CavernOfInterest_10:0 "A strange scholar has long argued that mushrooms are the greatest hope for our future—or the source of our downfall, if we do not heed his words (and fund his research). Let's make sure not to alert him to our most recent discovery: a vast cavern full of mushrooms of every shape, colour, size, and taste. That said, we should make sure to bring this to the attention of our fungi farmers, because such a cavern could very well be exactly what we need to feed our growing population."
  CavernOfInterest_11:0 "In our explorations of the Dwarovar, skeletons are not an uncommon find. Nor are weapons, of all material and make. But never before have we encountered both in the sheer quantity that litter this cavern. We must have stumbled upon some ancient, massive, battlefield. The mind can scarce imagine how much blood flowed over this cavern floor, and how many fought and died with the same stalactites looming above them as we see now. We cannot even be sure exactly who fought here—dwarf bones mix with orcish mix with goblin mix with elven—and there are also those stranger still, which bear no resemblance to any creature we know. Still, every bone bears the same reminder: though it is good to die in battle, it is better still for your enemy to do so!"
  CavernOfInterest_12:0 "We've found nothing. Absolutely nothing. The cavern is empty, extremely empty, extraordinarily empty. It feels empty even with our mining party's intrusion, as if before they entered it, it was some emptiness-beyond-empty. How strange—wait, no, nothing is less strange in Dwarovar than an empty cavern. On to the next!"
  CavernOfInterest_13:0 "The cavern was—is—unexciting. Some stalagmites and stalactites, a few promising mineral seams that led nowhere. We were about to write it off as just yet another cavern in the infinite array of such that can be found in the Dwarovar, when a miner dropped her pickaxe down a hole. And never heard a sound, though she listened for minutes on end. There doesn't seem to be any practical use to such a hole, except perhaps as waste disposal, but it is a reminder to us all of just how deep the Dwarovar goes. And how deep we may go in the years to come."
  CavernOfInterest_14:0 "All who walk the Dwarovar know of Hehogrim the Diligent, legendary architect of the Holds, but it appears that even in Hehodovar he was not always working with minds quite his equal. Or such is the only conclusion we can draw from the discovery of his 'Digging for Dummies', yellowed pages wrapped in beaten leather tucked behind a boulder in the corner of a cavern. It seems a comprehensive guide to the architecture, engineering, and artisanry necessary to dig out and expand high-quality holds. It will surely be of great use as we deepen our nation—now if only we could decipher what he is talking about towards the end, when he reverses his direction of inquiry entirely and starts rambling about ascension..."
  CavernOfInterest_15:0 "Most commanders would describe battle as an art, a dance of move and counter-move, each side vying for the lethal upper hand. But it seems one scholar in Haraz Orldhûm thought instead to prove it a science, or at least we assume such from the discovery of a thick tome entitled 'Killing Orcs: An Introduction' in a corner of the cavern. It seems to outline every conceivable combination of terrain, soldiers, weaponry, and strategic aim, and provide the single ideal tactical path forward. We will have to have our generals study it, to see whether the nameless scholar succeeded in his goal—or if such outlandish ideas are part of what lead Aul-Dwarov to fall in the first place."
  CavernOfInterest_16:0 "Everyone who explores the Dwarovar has their own reason for doing so. Some seek relics of the past, while others seek future glory. Some seek vengeance, imagined or otherwise, while others seem to cast about for their own absolution. But the most common, and indeed perhaps the true aim of many who profess another, is wealth—and face to face with the enormous cache of gold we discovered in this cavern, one can see why it appeals!"
  CavernOfInterest_17:0 "It all just... crumbled away. The floor of the cavern, which dropped out below the exploratory team just as they were finishing setting up their equipment. The hope of the few miners who saw it happen, who felt fingers brush their own as their friends and colleagues plummeted to their doom. And perhaps some of the confidence of our nation, as we faced this grim reminder that in the Dwarovar, every step can be your last."
  CavernOfInterest_18:0 "Skulls are common in the Dwarovar. But skulls such as the one we discovered in this cavern, adorned in gold and silver, with rubies inlaid as teeth and sapphires as eyes, are not. Why an orc's head was preserved this way is far beyond our comprehension—perhaps a ritual forgotten now even by the most learned of shamans. Such a relic will make an excellent discussion piece for the audience room of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and it's not like the gems can shift as if watching you... Can they?"
  CavernOfInterest_19:0 "The Dwarovar is not an easy place to make our fortunes in, nor to make our futures in. It is blood and steel and darkness and peril, a fiend that seems to push you one step upward for every one you descend. It is enough to make one despondent—which is why it is important to appreciate caverns like the one we discovered, where a simple yet serene beauty reminds us of just what we fight for."
  CavernOfInterest_20:0 "In the cavern, there was an alcove. In the alcove, there was a shadow. In the shadow, there was a box. And in the box, there was a book.\n\nIn faded runes, it bears what must be in the sigil of Hehodovar. And inside, is enough information to make a man go mad... with ambition, for what we might forge the Dwarovar into."
  CavernOfInterest_21:0 "We have had to call off the exploration of our caverns."

  diggy.36.d:0 "For the first time in millennia, wheels shift upon metal track, as a section of the ancient Dwarovar rail system has been restored. It has taken great effort, but now, surely, the vast flow of people, goods, and armies, will make all of the effort worth it."

  diggy.39.d.2:0 "While a few people were beginning their explorations of the cavern, a huge earthquake tore out the ceiling of the cave, causing a rockfall and completely burying the cave."

They ain't gobbos!" After a very confused conversation, the strange dwarves agreed to come to the inner hold with us. They are a small group of about a thousand Granite Dwarves, whose clans lived in this hold for millennia. If they are to be believed, they have been hiding in the deepest parts of the hold for at least a century now, using guerilla tactics to fight off goblin search parties and other predators.

In every Hold, a second flag rose to adorn proud walls, to match the great banner of Aul-Dwarov already flapping in the wind.\n\nEvery one of these flags had its own history, its own triumphs and failures. In recent centuries, it is the failures that loomed large. But now, as they unite once more, all Halann remembers the way they stood strong against the Ancient Precursor Empire, the way they invented techniques and mechanisms still beyond our comprehension.

For today, they will be discussing the one issue most near and dear to Dwarven hearts, and the bedrock of their most bitter disputes — coin.\n\nIt is time for Aul-Dwarov to decide its budgetary priority for the years to come. Some argue for a policy of economic expansion, devoting every week to come to the construction of new infrastructure, from the homes that house our people to the temples they pray in to the warehouses that store almost every good found in Halann. Others would instead focus on efficiency, ensuring that our assembly lines are operating at full capacity and minimizing waste products, to boost our output like never before. Some Holds, especially those in strategic positions along the Dwarven Rail, would have us focus not on the production of goods but their free flow throughout the Empire — they remind us that blood must be pumped through a body if it is to live. A fourth group turns their eyes not inward but outwards, and decries the way that Serpentspine gems and minerals flow across Halann as a looting of our realm, that must immediately be stopped.\n\nThe Amlharaz grants each Hold a vote — but at the day's end, it shall speak in a single voice.

  diggy.55.d:0 "It may be an illusion, but there does seem to be a difference in delegates' choice of adornment as they take their seats in the Amlharaz today. Perhaps it is fitting more have brought their (ceremonial, yet sharp) axes and swords, for today the Amlharaz shall be deciding matters of blood, of steel, of fire. Today, the Amlharaz shall be discussing the Dwarven army.\n\nEach Hold has their own specialization when it comes to war, and in turn, each would see a different focus for Aul-Dwarov's forces. Some delegates hearken to the Greentide past, and would have our army grow to a size where it could match the Goblin and Orcish hordes. Others would pursue a policy of refurbishing the army's guns and improving its armour, which they promise shall forge our soldiers into a wall as unbreakable as those of any Hold.

Opposing them in turn are the representative of Holds who would have our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] instead listen to those Dwarves of exceeding brilliance and skill, and grant them the authority to cut through seas of paperwork as they deem necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the Empire.

  diggy.510.t:0 "Unstable Foundations"
  diggy.510.d:0 "The stone seems to split and crack, as an entire section of our hold, brand new, sinks deep into the mountain. Upon investigation, it appears that the specific structures were built upon an underground river, and with enough construction and erosion, the stone simply could not hold. Fortunately, those who were present at the time were able to be rescued, and although there were many injuries, there were thankfully no deaths."
  diggy.510.a:0 "Who approved this?"


  diggy.511.t:0 "Serpentsmite"
  diggy.511.d:0 "Is this the end? The mountains themselves seem to roar with rage, as an earthquake unlike any seen in living memory shakes our hold to its very core. Great cracks form in the rock, swallowing buildings whole, and rubble falls from above, shattering structures and burying citizens alive. For a full hour, the quake continues, reaping ever more damage as the seconds go by. And then, just as suddenly as it began, it ceases. The damage is immense, and many of our resources are taken up simply keeping our hold in one piece. Now, however, a choice lies before us; this great quake, which split open the core of our hold, has revealed many precious minerals that were previously undiscovered. Due to the unstable nature of the fissures, access to these minerals will likely be short-lived. We could devote effort to harvesting these resources, but this would surely take away from the efforts to rescue and treat survivors."
  diggy.511.a:0 "We should exploit those untapped ores!"
  diggy.511.b:0 "The wounded must be cared for."

  diggy.512.t:0 "Magma Veins"
  diggy.512.d:0 "The miners and builders deepening our hold have run into several pockets of liquid hot magma while digging new tunnels. These have forced us to reroute the excavations and change the schematics to accommodate these unanticipated barriers. However, they may also present an opportunity. With some clever engineering, we could tap into them to provide heat and power for the new level's dwellings and industries."
  diggy.512.a:0 "Let's try to use them."
  diggy.512.b:0 "Just dig around them!"
  
  diggy.513.t:0 "The Bedrock"
  diggy.513.d1:0 "When constructing a hold, there are many things to consider.

  diggy.516.d:0 "With the construction of our Hold continuing, one cannot help but think it could be done at a faster pace. Though it may be quite an expensive undertaking, if we were to devote yet more of our nation's resources to meeting the various demands of construction, we could surely have our hold completed in record time!"
  diggy.516.a:0 "Construction is paramount, no matter the cost"
  diggy.516.b:0 "Everything seems to be fine as it is"

  diggy.517.t:0 "A Beautiful Hold"
  diggy.517.d:0 "With continual advancements of hold construction in [Root.GetName], several prominent members of our more artistic community: artists, stonecarvers, and various others, have brought a proposal to the forefront. As a demonstration of our culture, they say, our hold too must in and of itself be a work of art. To implement this would surely take large amounts of time and resources away from other projects, but perhaps, like all art, true beauty is worth the price?"
  diggy.517.a:0 "Let us build a beautiful hold"
  diggy.517.b:0 "Operations will continue as before"

  diggy.518.t:0 "Military Labourers"
  diggy.518.d:0 "Though many are willing to work to construct our great hold, there are limited numbers of those willing to work. Yet, it seems that we have a vast, untapped labour supply in the form of our army. Using military personnel for construction would certainly help the process, but our generals worry about the impact this move could have on our military readiness. So, we must choose our priorities: our hold, or our army?"
  diggy.518.a:0 "Our army is worthless if it has nothing to defend"
  diggy.518.b:0 "Our hold is worthless if there is no one to defend it"

  diggy.519.t:0 "Apatite Layer"
  diggy.519.d:0 "Apatite is best known for its use as an index mineral, with a hardness of 5 in the Dwohs Hardness Scale. It is usually green in color, but can be yellow, brown, blue, purple, pink, or colorless. These colors are often so vivid that apatite has frequently been cut as a gemstone. Apatite is a brittle material. It breaks by both fracture and cleavage, but the cleavage is generally indistinct.\n\nWe've faced such a mineral while digging, should we keep digging through it?"
  diggy.519.a:0 "OF COURSE!"
  diggy.519.b:0 "We can't handle the cost, let's find another way"

  diggy.520.t:0 "Orthoclase Layer"
  diggy.520.d:0 "Orthoclase is a feldspar mineral, one of the most abundant rock-forming minerals of the continental crust. Orthoclase is most widely encountered as the pink feldspar found in many granites and is assigned a hardness of "6" in the Dwohs hardness scale.\n\nOur brave miners have encountered such a mineral while digging, what should we do?"
  diggy.520.a:0 "We shall not slow down!"
  diggy.520.b:0 "Let's find another path"

  diggy.521.t:0 "Iron Pyrite Layer"
  diggy.521.d:0 "Pyrite is a brass-yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster and is the most common sulfide mineral. It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs, usually in small quantities, in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks worldwide. Pyrite is so common that many dwarven geologists would consider it to be a ubiquitous mineral. Such a material is now in our way."
  diggy.521.a:0 "No Pyrite shall block our way!"
  diggy.521.b:0 "Try to dig through another path"

  diggy.522.t:0 "Spinel Layer"
  diggy.522.d:0 "Spinel is an oxide mineral (7.5 to 8 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale) and is often found in octahedral crystals. It is typically found in three geologic situations: As crystals in limestones and dolomites that have been subjected to contact metamorphism; as irregularly-shaped grains in basic igneous rocks; and as water-worn pebbles in alluvial deposits. It seems we have found a huge deposit of it in the way of our digging operations."
  diggy.522.a:0 "What's the problem? Dig through it!"
  diggy.522.b:0 "Maybe we should rethink our strategy..."

  diggy.523.t:0 "Corundum Layer"
  diggy.523.d:0 "Corundum is a rock-forming mineral that is found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, with a value of 9 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale. The mineral is widely known for its extreme hardness and for the fact that it is sometimes found as beautiful transparent crystals in many different colors. The extreme hardness makes corundum an excellent abrasive, and when that hardness is found in beautiful crystals, you have the perfect material for cutting gemstones.\n\nWe've encountered a massive layer of it. How should we proceed ?"
  diggy.523.a:0 "Nothing shall stop us."
  diggy.523.b:0 "Maybe if we go a little more to the left..?"

  diggy.524.t:0 "Carbonadwo Layer"
  diggy.524.d:0 "Carbonadwo diamonds are a rare and unusual variety of diamond. When found in the field, they look nothing like any other type of diamond. They are dark, opaque, porous, and often display a subtle luster. They are composed almost entirely of microcrystalline diamonds in random crystallographic orientations. The name "black diamond" is sometimes used for carbonadwo, however that name should technically be reserved for diamonds with a black body color caused by clouds of tiny black inclusions or by carbonization of fracture surfaces.\n\nThis is the hardest layer we've ever encountered, a 10 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale."
  diggy.524.a:0 "Finally, a worthy opponent!"
  diggy.524.b:0 "I don't want our battle to be legendary..."

  diggy.525.t:0 "Having a Blast"
  diggy.525.d:0 "Several mining engineers have come to us over the last few days with a single word on their minds: explosives. We aren't sure how safe these explosives are, or even how our engineers even got their hands on them, but they assure us that these will surely speed up the construction of our hold. The engineers in question do seem quite eager, perhaps a little too eager..."

  diggy.526.b:0 "Use the find to bolster our treasury!"

  diggy.527.t:0 "Cave Slime Ambushes"
  diggy.527.d:0 "A message from [Root.Capital.GetName]! Our diggers report sporadic ambushes by cave slimes that are slowing down the whole deepening operation. Where they came from is a mystery, but it is clear that to make sure the dig continues apace we need to send in proper guards for the miners"
  diggy.527.a:0 "Send in the military!"
  diggy.527.b:0 "We don’t have the men to spare"

  diggy.528.t:0 "Administrative Gridlock"
  diggy.528.d:0 "Deepening a hold involves more than just digging: it is also a great administrative task to decide who gets to own the new quarters, what kind of design is used in the architecture and what plan is employed for the new level. Sometimes this leads to disagreements between leading figures in the expansion operation, and unfortunately two rival bureaucrats have gotten entangled in such a fierce gridlock that our intervention is necessary."
  diggy.528.a:0 "Send our most trusted administrators to help solve the issue."
  diggy.528.b:0 "Fire both of the fools!"

  diggy.529.t:0 "A Miner Distinguishes Themselves"
  diggy.529.d:0 "While the deepening operation continues at our hold a local miner has garnered recognition as an exceptionally skilled individual, capable of doing the work of multiple diggers by themselves. They have approached us asking for greater pay and official recognition."
  diggy.529.a:0 "Grant their request."
  diggy.529.b:0 "They deserve a more prestigious role!"

  diggy.530.t:0 "A Merchants Proposal"
  diggy.530.d:0 "A merchant from our hold has come to us with a proposal: they wish to focus the resources of the hold’s traders on helping the digging efforts. It would hamper their ability to barter in the short term, but a more magnificent hold would bring in more money for everyone."
  diggy.530.a:0 "A small price to pay."
  diggy.530.b:0 "We cannot afford this."


  diggy.550.t:0 "News of an Orc Warband"

  diggy.553.t:0 "Venombrew Surplus"
  diggy.553.d:0 "The hallucinogenic beverage known as venombrew has been produced by the goblins of the spiderlands since time immemorial. A valuable commodity to trade with other goblin tribes, it has become even more valued in modern times by those goblins who spend their time making strange art or devices. This is why it is so forunate our artisans have produced a surplus of it this year.\n\nWhat should be done with it, oh clever [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
  diggy.553.a:0 "Sell it! Money for the coffers!"
  diggy.553.b:0 "Give it to the artists."
  diggy.553.c:0 "The inventors seem like they need some."
  diggy.553.e:0 "Can we use it as a weapon?"

  diggy.554.t:0 "Railway Repairs"
  diggy.554.d:0 "The Dwarovrod in [event_province.GetName] is in serious need of repair after several sections were damaged: a cave-in buried a set of switches and signals, a band of feral bugbears ripped up rails to smelt into weapons, and a small spur line has been nearly obliterated by a lava flow. Trains carrying cargo and passengers are backed up for miles, as they take turns using one track for both directions. Repairing the track will be expensive, but not doing so will cost even more in the long term."
  diggy.554.a:0 "Fix the rails as expressly as possible!"
  diggy.554.b:0 "Unfortunately, repairs must be delayed."

  diggy.555.t:0 "Wandering Ettins"
  diggy.555.d:0 "It's hard enough for an ettin's two heads to agree with one another, let alone more than one of the beasts to act in conjunction. Both savage and stupid, they are almost always solitary creatures. However, a shortage of prey has led to a group of hungry ettins in [event_province.GetName] to band together. Now they are wreaking havoc on our settlements there, eating our subjects with glee. We will need to send a cohort of soldiers and adventurers to deal with them - but such a force will not be cheap."
  diggy.555.a:0 "Pack two guns, one for each head."
  diggy.555.b:0 "The settlers are on their own."

  diggy.556.t:0 "Antique Machine"
  diggy.556.d:0 "One of the best tinkerers in [Root.Capital.GetName] has brought us marvelous news. Through hard work, gumption, and a spark of genius, she has managed to restore an ancient dwarven machine to functioning. Inlaid with a beautiful latticework of mithril and brass, studded with gems faintly glowing with arcane energy, whirring with gears and bearings still as precise as the day they were crafted - yet we still have no earthly idea what it does and why it was built. Undoubtedly it would fetch a princely sum from a wealthy collector, but we may also discern some valuable knowledge if we choose to study the device."
  diggy.556.a:0 "Sell it."
  diggy.556.b:0 "Study it."

  diggy.557.t:0 "Halanna's Breath"
  diggy.557.d:0 "Farmers in [province.GetName] have reported a marvelous finding. Seeking new caverns to sow, they stumbled upon a dormant, cooled caldera, hosting remarkable, almost supernatural botany. Mushrooms the size of trees sprout up from the ground and hang down from the roof like stalactites. Serpentbloom wraps like vines around the stalks and caps, glowing so strongly that the cavern is lit with a dawn-like twilight. The farmers estimate that this single lush cavern could provide as much food as a dozen cultivated ones."
  diggy.557.a:0 "Splendid!"

  diggy.558.t:0 "Skittering in the Dark"
  diggy.558.d:0 "Before the townspeople of [event_province.GetName] know what's upon them, dozens eight-legged monstrosities clamber up the walls and cut the guards in two with razor-sharp pincers. Soon, the citizens are wrapped up in impenetrable webs, drained of their vital fluids, their dried husks hosts to clutches of spider eggs. We can clear the nest with torch and blade, but the damage has been done."
  diggy.558.d2:0 "A guard's keen ears luckily pick up the faint tremors of hundreds of arachnid legs skittering towards a township in [event_province.GetName]. Given enough warning, the townspeople take up positions with torches, whips, nets, and prods. Soon a massive herd of giant spiders comes stampeding toward the settlement and into the improvised corral. With luck and skill, we will tame these beasts, harvest their silk, and terrorize our enemies riding on their backs."
  diggy.558.a:0 "A dark day!"
  diggy.558.b:0 "Bring those eight legs to heel!"
  diggy.558.c:0 "More spiders? What a lovely day!"

  diggy.559.t:0 "Showin' 'Em Who's Boss"
  diggy.559.d:0 "A puny bunch of orcs have come to our camp in [event_province.GetName]. Their chief says he and his tribe want the loot and glory that comes with being part of [Root.GetName]. The [Root.GovernmentName] always needs more warriors, but we should make these runts carry our water and chop our wood before putting them on our front lines."
  diggy.559.a:0 "We're really the best!"

  diggy.560.t:0 "Tribal Wars"
  diggy.560.d:0 "A caravan of settlers in [province.GetName] has stumbled upon a grisly sight. Local orcs and goblins, skewered, dismembered, beheaded - an apparent mutual massacre. A little further down the road, they encounter the abandoned camps of the natives, the survivors having evidently fled the area. Despite their primitive status, their corpses and camps are ripe for looting. Additionally, their absence will make settling [event_province.GetName] all the easier."
  diggy.560.a:0 "Splendid!"

  diggy.561.t:0 "Treasure Trove"
  diggy.561.d:0 "A rockslide in a cave has uncovered a sprawling mine complex, possibly hundreds of years old. Although the mine itself seems to have long since been completely emptied of anything worth digging up, during our explorations we came across a massive hoard of jewellery and coinage presumably left here for safe keeping before the entrance was buried."
  diggy.561.a:0 "The mines relinquish one last haul..."

  diggy.562.t:0 "Ancient War Golem"
  diggy.562.d:0 "While digging, our miners uncovered what they believed to be a large mithril statue, but further inspection and excavation has revealed something very different; It's a dormant War Golem, buried for over a thousand years!"
  diggy.562.a:0 "It will serve us on the battlefield, as it was meant to."
  diggy.562.b:0 "Made of mithril, you say..."
  diggy.562.c:0 "It's too precious! It belongs in a museum."

  diggy.563.t:0 "Ancestral Statue"
  diggy.563.d:0 "We have discovered a small, mostly-buried shrine, possibly dating back to before the last days of the Dwarovar. It contains only one thing: An intricately carved and vibrantly painted statue of an unknown Dwarf. Although it bears no inscription, the significance is clear; this was once an object of great veneration."
  diggy.563.a:0 "Smash it. These lands are ours now."
  diggy.563.b:0 "This was a place of veneration, and so it shall be once more."
  diggy.563.c:0 "To the right bidder, this could fetch a high price..."

  diggy.564.t:0 "Lost Armory"
  diggy.564.d:0 "An expedition exploring the caverns of [event_province.GetName] have come upon a great steel door set into the mouth of one of the caves. With hours of brute force, they have managed to pry it open, discovering a massive cache of ancient dwarven weapons still in pristine condition. This armory will equip our armies well for many wars to come."
  diggy.564.a:0 "I'll have one of those axes, please!"
  diggy.564.b:0 "Give me both of those axes, now!"

  diggy.565.t:0 "From the Darkness"
  diggy.565.d:0 "The locals from [event_province.GetName] are reporting that strange creatures are emerging from the depths, causing untold havoc and fear. They are requesting that we send an expedition to clear the place out so they can sleep at night again."
  diggy.565.a:0 "Yea, yea, we'll get to it."

  diggy.566.t:0 "Bat Flu"
  diggy.566.d:0 "A strange wasting illness among the townsfolk in [event_province.GetName] has left many dying in droves with dry coughs and rattling breaths. From what we can tell, this sickness can be traced back to the province's massive population of cave bats. Our mages claim to have developed an elixir that, when sprayed into the caverns, will cause the loathsome creatures to shrivel up and blow away like dust. Our more pragmatic advisors suggest we use those resources to help to the sick and dying."
  diggy.566.a:0 "Spray and pray"
  diggy.566.b:0 "Tend to the ill"

  diggy.567.t:0 "Bugbears Attack"
  diggy.567.d:0 "Out of the dark corners and caverns of [event_province.GetName] they come: bugbears, with matted fur and frenzy in their eyes, attacking all in their path. Already several outlying settlements have been put to the torch and the colonists have been carried off. As luck would have it, one of the prisoners has escaped and tells us she can lead us back to the bugbears' hideout. We could send a company of soldiers to dispatch them and free the colonists. On the other hand, bugbears attack indiscriminately - by bribing and cajoling the leaders of the band, they may leave our [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] settlers alone and turn their savage axes on the natives of [event_province.GetName]."
  diggy.567.a:0 "Don't bother. Kill them all."

  diggy.568.t:0 "Train Wreck"
  diggy.568.d:0 "Our colonists in [event_province.GetName] have run into a roadblock, literally. A massive barricade of mining carts, bulky freight cars, and sleek engines lies in the middle of the track, studded with makeshift turrets. Strewn about are a motley array of rusting weapons and armor, and skeletons of dwarves, orcs, and goblins. Whoever built the barricade lost their battle long ago, but their works remain an obstacle to our colony's development. We could direct the colonists to stall other projects to dismantle the barricade, or to work around the barricade, leaving the wreckage for another day."

The wood of the trusses supporting the shafts rots, and the screws rust away.

They claim that for the last few months, while collecting mushrooms, strange sounds could be heard in the distance, and recently we have received reports of glowing eyes and occasional “walking mushrooms”. These rumors have been discarded until now, as yesterday it was discovered that the freshly-grown mushrooms are now protected by a large number of mushroom people. A few unfortunate and bruised farmers have already been beaten up by them, and farms in the area are now paralyzed."

  diggy.580.d:0 "Since the previous incident with our farms, the mushroom people of [Root.GetName] have slowly grown bolder. What used to be a rare sighting is now a frequent occurrence. They constantly scout the common walking routes and sometimes even settlements.. And now some of our citizens’ possessions have started to disappear, and leaving many worried that mushroom people might be getting smarter. The situation is becoming untenable and action is needed.\n\nWe could simply smoke them out, though they have grown significantly in numbers since we last considered this possibility. Or, as one young diplomat recommended, we could attempt to negotiate with them, since they have shown signs of intelligence."

  diggy.581.d:0 "Some of our senior diplomats have objected to the idea of trying to negotiate with the mushroom people, since it is known that they don’t have the ability to speak, but in the end, they turned out to be wrong. After some awkward gestures, the mushroom people of [Root.GetName] were able to somewhat understand our intent, and they even gave some of the stolen goods back.\n\nAfter nearly a week of back and forth, the negotiations resulted in a mutually beneficial agreement: our settlers and the local mushroom people will coexist, and the state will protect them in exchange for a steady supply of food… which would turn out to be mushrooms. Many are now wondering why they would send us the mushrooms they previously so valiantly defended, and it appears they are not actually as smart as we thought they were."

  diggy.583.d:0 "Although minotaurs are strong creatures, their small numbers and lack of organisation mean that, apart from a few ambushes on small caravans or on lone travellers, they pose no serious threat to our glorious nation. However, an exceptionally well-coordinated herd of minotaurs has launched a raid on the arsenal of [event_province.GetName], looting most of the weapons and causing trouble in the surrounding workshops and settlements. If we are to get rid of them before they can do any more damage to our subjects, it will be necessary to send a well equipped detachment of our soldiers and adventurers."

  diggy.751.t:0 "A Night of Blood and Fire"
  diggy.751.d:0 "The animosity between the peoples of the Serpentspine is ancient and storied, a tale written in blood and iron, scrawled on the stony halls of the Dwarovar. The generations of conflict between Dwarves, Goblins, and Orcs have created a broad and general distrust, an assumption that the Other desires nothing more than to kill and take what little each people have. Whispered tales of atrocities and glorious revenge are told in hushed voices to children at night, to make them fear the boogymen and raise them to rejoice in their ancient enemy's destruction. So the distrust between peoples is reinforced and compounded, each side believing the worst of their foes, ensuring that conflict will continue to rage whenever orcs, goblins, and dwarves come into contact with each other.\n\nIn the province of [event_province.GetName], this atmosphere of xenophobia and paranoia has boiled over into open conflict between the peoples that live there. It is uncertain how the conflict started, but it quickly escalated into mob violence, with armed gangs patrolling the streets, breaking into homes, looting shops, and killing any members of other races they laid their hands on. After a gory night of fire and blood, the grip of murderous insanity began to release the mob, and the survivors could begin to take stock of the aftermath - Houses burned, livelihoods destroyed, countless dead and even more displaced. The minority populations are particularly devastated, and it will take years for them to recover, if they ever do."

  diggy.752.d:0 "Competition in a marketplace is a driver of innovation and productivity, but it is all too common for major players in a market to institute policies that exclude new entries. The methods by which this is done vary, but often range beyond simply economics and into social control and bigotry. Such is the case that this appears to be occurring in [event_province.GetName], where local businesses have conspired to force minorities out of businesses where they have otherwise been profitable. Their tactics have included undercutting prices, leveraging municipal councils to implement unfavorable policies for their competitors, and vandalism of minority-controlled properties. While some degree of hostile competition is expected, these actions have gone far beyond simply business hostility and are targeting individuals who would otherwise be profitable businessfolk. If we step in to stop these actions it will certainly be unpopular, but we will likely strengthen the local economy by doing so."

  diggy.753.d:0 "A wealthy dwarven majority district in [event_province.getname] has recently seen an influx of orcs and goblins of means, who have used their wealth to acquire property and take up residence in the area. They have made this move despite the overwhelming dwarven population of the district being unwelcoming to them, intent on shouldering into territories that would deny them simply on the basis of the circumstance of birth, insistent on acquiring good opportunities for their children and showing that they are more than capable of living side by side in peace. While there are no rules that explicitly forbid orcs and goblins from living in the district, the populace is up in arms over this move. A group of influential business owners and local magnates have petitioned the government to force the minorities out of the district, though there is no legal standing to do so. They will certainly be upset and cause problems if we do not, however."

  diggy.754.d:0 "As important as state and family are for dwarven society, business is in many ways the heart of day-to-day civilization among the dwarves. Businesses are organized as associations of similar enterprises, often through related families, known as Cartels, and are responsible for not only private sector work but also various subcontracted governmental assignments, such as public security. As more land has been reclaimed in the Dwarovar and the number of outlying settlements and districts grows, the role of these private police forces becomes ever more important in keeping the peace. Unfortunately, there has recently been a string of problematic policing activities that has revealed major biases in the cartel police forces - they have refused to intervene in protecting minorities, failed to press legal charges against connected individuals, and have even been accused of perpetrating violent acts against individuals that some consider “undesirable” - goblins and orcs living in the districts they patrol. There is a general feeling that public security is being undermined by the cartel security forces, and some have asked us to step in more directly to ensure better trained and more morally upstanding police are in place."

  diggy.755.d:0 "The reclamation of the Dwarovar by the dwarves has been a goal for thousands of years, but it was nothing more than a remote dream until the Greentide brought the overwhelming majority of the orcs and goblins out of the mountains. Into the power vacuum left behind flowed the reclaimers - remnant holds and adventurers from the surface alike struck out to retake their ancestral halls. But for all the dwarven claims to rightful ownership, the goblins and orcs have inhabited the roads and holds of the mountains in the dwarves' absence, and have no lack of a claim to homeland. As such, conflicting claims over various pieces of land has been a constant crisis since the reclamation of the Dwarovar.\n\nNow, in [event_province.GetName], such claims are threatening to boil over into open conflict. Two different clans are asserting that they are the rightful owners of valuable land, rich in minerals and containing many old structures that date to the time of Aul Dwarov. Both are refusing to yield in their rights of property and have brought dozens of pieces of documentation and oral testimony to the courts to back their claims. As the court case rages, tensions rise and the risk of angry words turning into blows rises. Knowing the matter to be sensitive, the courts have turned to the central government and ask us to resolve the matter, as they do not seem to have a ready answer to the question."

  diggy.756.t:0 "Minority Districts"
  diggy.756.d:0 "In the province of [event_province.GetName], there has recently been an dramatic increase in racial segregation. A combination of deliberate city planning measures by our administrators and unwelcoming attitudes from the population have forced the region's minorities into rundown neighborhoods that are overpopulated and unsanitary. The suffering in these ghettos, consigned to the remote corners of the hold, is immense, but it is also easy to miss - sticking to the prosperous parts of the city, one might never know that there are such terrible areas in the town. We could ensure that infrastructure extends to those neighborhoods and force changes in some of these more xenophobic administrators, but such an operation would surely be unpopular."

  diggy.757.d:0 "A terrible accident has recently befallen one of our mining operations in [event_province.GetName] - a shaft that was believed to have been secure has collapsed and buried many miners alive. Most died immediately, while others were left to languish in the dark until they were rescued. In the aftermath of this great loss of life, the mine overseers have conducted an investigation of the likely causes and have produced a report that blames the inferior workmanship of the minority populations as the cause! Citing their many failings in intelligence, workmanship, and materials manufacturing, they have laid the blame squarely at the feet of the minorities. This has inflamed the emotions of the families and friends of the deceased miners, and has led to the mass-firings of many in mining and unrelated jobs around the province. Some of our advisors have suggested that we should likely review the report and accident site to double check the accusations of the foreman, but that would be expensive and potentially upset relations with the mining cartel."
  diggy.757.a:0 "The Cartel must have the right of it - it's the minority's fault!"

  diggy.758.d:0 "The memories of dwarves are long, the names of ancestors from 40 generations ago remembered in prayer and the loves and hatreds of their people felt longer. Among the noble houses and wealthy elites of dwarven society, who still keep relics from the time of Aul Dwarov, there is a deep-seated feeling that the whole of the Serpentspine is the rightful possession of the dwarves, that their ancestral and rightful homeland must be retaken, and that no compromise can be offered to any lesser claimants, either dwarves of other clans or the goblins and orcs that still dwell in the darkness of the Dwarovar.\n\nAs we have expanded and reclaimed more territory, ever more goblins and orcs have come to dwell within our territory. While the majority live at the fringes, many have found their way into our towns and cities, where they work as a permanent underclass. Distrusted at best by the population, there have recently been rumblings that some of the workers have reached a camaraderie with these minority populations, feeling more in common with their fellow laborers than with the wealthy, and that they have begun to argue for extending certain rights and privileges to the orc and goblin populations. As word of this has reached the elites it has provoked furor - have these foolish laborers forgotten of the glory of their ancestors, and who it was that stole the ancient empire? A group of wealthy and influential nobles have come to the government and demand that we come down hard on any troublemakers and on the minority districts as a whole, putting those repugnant creatures in their place and ensuring that our state will not go the way of Aul Dwarov."

By the time of Aul-Dwarov's fall, it had largely become a ceremonial body, though the sight of every Hold's flag hung in turn on the Amlharaz's walls remained a symbol of Dwarven unity until the end.\n\nIt is clear the Empire we have reforged through blood and steel is enough to match Aul-Dwarov at its height. But if we wish to surpass our ancestors, and make our Empire something all Dwarves can take pride in, a leader of all Halann, we must restore this ancient and sacred body.

  serpent_rot.20.a:0 "What have we done..."

  serpent_rot.21.t:0 "Healthy Carrier"
  serpent_rot.21.d:0 "Against all odds, a healthy carrier seems to have appeared! His entire family had succumbed to the disease, but he is the only one to have survived! How shall we proceed?"

  serpent_rot.21.b:0 "There is no time, Mycos Caurak must burn!"

  serpent_rot.22.t:0 "The Explosion of Mycos Caurak"
  serpent_rot.22.d:0 "As soon as the flames began to spread through the narrow passages of the collapsed path of the cavern, a huge gas explosion followed, killing our entire team on the spot, and making the cavern forever inaccessible."
  serpent_rot.22.a:0 "A small price to pay for salvation"

  serpent_rot.23.t:0 "The Healthy Carrier"
  serpent_rot.23.d:0 "After examining the body of the healthy carrier, without finding anything abnormal at home, he confessed to us his consumption in large quantities of a particular mushroom, known as Pristine Fungi.\n\nAlthough this mushroom is renowned as disgusting, it seems to be the only thing that all survivors have common, having had to consume the mushroom in order to survive after losing their livelihoods to the Rot."
  serpent_rot.23.a:0 "Run further experiments"

  serpent_rot.23.c:0 "This is a trap; burn the mushrooms!"

  serpent_rot.24.t:0 "What Kind of Spell?"

  serpent_rot.24.c:0 "Evocation"

  serpent_rot.25.t:0 "It looks like Necromancy"

  serpent_rot.25.a:0 "Look for the Caster"
  serpent_rot.25.b:0 "Study the Spell"
  serpent_rot.25.c:0 "Search for clues in Mycos Caurak"

  serpent_rot.26.a:0 "Seal the damned place."

  serpent_rot.27.t:0 "Efforts Wasted"
  serpent_rot.27.d:0 "It seems that the Rot is not magical, but rather a natural disease. Our people are in uproar, and we must find solutions quickly. There is no more time to waste."
  serpent_rot.27.a:0 "Focus on treating the sick"
  serpent_rot.27.b:0 "Burn the sick, stop the spread"

  serpent_rot.28.t:0 "The Serpent Slain"
  serpent_rot.28.d:0 "The Serpent's Rot has been totally eradicated from our country! Our people can live without fear once more. Across our nation, the people are jubilant, music fills the streets, and the nobility and commoners alike rejoice! Tomorrow, we will mourn..."
  serpent_rot.28.a:0 "... but today, we celebrate!"

  serpent_rot.29.t:0 "Local Hospital"
  serpent_rot.29.d:0 "A small group of mages and doctors are organising a medical expedition to [Root.GetName], but will need funding from us to effectively fight the disease."
  serpent_rot.29.a:0 "Send them the money"
  serpent_rot.29.b:0 "We don't have the funds to spare"

  serpent_rot.30.t:0 "Sacrificial Breakthrough"
  serpent_rot.30.d:0 "After several months of hard research, one of our most dedicated researchers seemed to have found a way to at least slow the Serpent's Rot. Unfortunately in the course of his research, he deliberately infected himself with the Rot in order to view the results of his work, and though he could slow the disease, he could not halt it. Worse, besides the loss of one of our best minds, he was not able to properly explain his research before his untimely demise. His peers are already trying to decipher his notes."
  serpent_rot.30.a:0 "His sacrifice will not be in vain"

  serpent_rot.31.t:0 "Fighting the Rot"
  serpent_rot.31.d:0 "Our researchers seem to have found a way to slow the progression of the virus among the infected, even seeming to stop it completely in some cases. It's a big step towards finding true definitive cure!"
  serpent_rot.31.a:0 "We slowly inch closer"

  serpent_rot.32.t:0 "Population Demands more Funding"
  serpent_rot.32.d:0 "Several petitioners representing the common people, despite the monumental resources we have already committed, demand that more effort be used in fighting the Serpent's rot. Though we have made it clear how much has already been put in place, they are adamant that more must be done."
  serpent_rot.32.a:0 "We will. Let us invest even more."
  serpent_rot.32.b:0 "Not fast enough they say? Use them as test subjects!"

  hoardcurse.5.d:0 "Corruption and greed dominate our country. Within our Holds, every bank, every business, every dwarf is plagued by this evil. Unable to perceive the world other than through money, it would seem that a vice that has hidden in plain sight, within the most repressed aspects of dwarf nature is now spreading across the country like rust through a sword. There is no question of morals, values or charity, only riches, and everything seems acceptable to our citizens to achieve their desires... even to kill their fellows for a single coin."

  hoardcurse.6.d:0 "At the very highest of those afflicted with the Hoardcurse are bureaucrats and officials of our great nation.

  hoardcurse.8.b:0 "Surely this shall only breed more corruption?"

  hoardcurse.9.t:0 "Overhaul the Banks"
  hoardcurse.9.d:0 "The banks are no doubt the biggest hoarders of gold of them all, all under the pretense of holding it for safe-keeping! If we want to ensure the sustainability of our economy in the years to come, we must make sure that our banks stay healthy and keep their heads cool.\n\nWe could directly bring the private banks under our control, and stabilize the systems from within. Or we could force the banks to collect on their debts, essentially reducing the amount of gold hoarded by the individuals of our country."

  hoardcurse.16.d:0 "With a huge hold on our textile industry, a single dwarf can effectively dictate the fashion and style of our fellow citizens. There would be no problem in this if they did not use the influence of his company to determine the import price of cotton, silk and other textile materials, in addition to flooding the market with mass-produced low-quality goods.

  hoardcurse.20.a:0 "Slaves no more!"

  hoardcurse.21.t:0 "Curtail the Hoardcurse"
  hoardcurse.21.d:0 "In order to sustainably combat the Hoardcurse, we must extend our reforms to the whole nation, making sure that every dwarf holding power, and every dwarf working for them is cured!

  hoardcurse.60.t:0 "Relations Break Down"
  hoardcurse.60.d:0 "The terrible Hoardcurse has struck our country to the core and the greed that glints in the eyes of every dwarf in our country has clearly taken hold of the Asra Bank officials as well! This has led to a deterioration of our relationship with the headquarters in Anbénncost, who deem us responsible for the curse-stricken employees. Preposterous, but there is no way around it: we must address this situation in one way or the other. One possibility is that we try to pay off the hoardcursed individuals and temporarily let them hold mere honorary positions in government, or we take matters into our own hands and remove the afflicted bankers from office, a decision that would surely anger the central authorities..."

  hoardcurse.61.t:0 "A Compromise"
  hoardcurse.61.d:0 "We have reached a compromise with the Asra Bank headquarters in Anbénncost about how we are to proceed with the hoardcursed bankers. They have sent a delegation of inspectors in order to reign the rogue officials in. That way these matters stay as an internal affair with the Bank, and no further conflict of interest arises."

  hoardcurse.90.t:0 "Reclaiming our Glory"
  hoardcurse.90.d:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] leaves to walk the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] today, taking a discreet inspection with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retainers, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] thinks briefly to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors -- how proud they would be to see the Hold flourishing once more!\n\nGoods come from within and without the hold's depths, invigorating its many layers with the haggling of merchants. Rowdy taverns are bright and boisterous, filled with drunken dwarves either boasting of their ancestors' feats, or snoring dwarves who have drunken themselves silly in delight.\n\nOn to the industrial sectors, where other senses take precedence over sight. The sizzle of water upon tempered steel, the clang of hammer on metal and wood, ringing across the hold as various guilds reestablish themselves. The scalding heat of the countless ravenous furnaces fed by the bellows only makes the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] smile. The sound of the hammers and bellows seem to resonate within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart, as the hold's wonder must do for every dwarf that lives within.\n\nAs the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] heads to return home after this fruitful day, one sight mars the visit's ending: homeless dwarves, thin and weak from malnourishment, something that hearkens back to more tragic days. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] retainers trace [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes and quickly note that it is inevitable for there to be dregs even in such prosperous times as the present. Even during the most glorious times of the dwarves at the height of Aul-Dwarov, there were still poor people and slums, after all!\n\nWith a hesitant nod and lingering gaze, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] moves on, attempting to remove these thoughts to focus on the pressing matters at hand. The fate of few deviants in society pale in comparison to reclaiming their homeland and riches of their ancestor. The enemy is out there, in here there is naught but joy, wonder and magnificence!"

Gold, gold, gold!\n\nThe glorious, gleaming, glowing yellow metal graces even the most downtrodden of hands, as the great celebrations are held to our traders return, and they flaunt their newly found wealth with great aplomb, happily showering our people with gilded coins. A new age, a Golden Age, descends upon our nation!"
  hoardcurse.91.a:0 "Gold, gold, gold!"

  hoardcurse.92.t:0 "An Odd Predicament"
  hoardcurse.92.d:0 "More and more trade flows into our nation, and with it comes outsider dwarves to swell our numbers. Our farms are bountiful, our breweries full, and our mines at their peak.\n\nAnd yet, our nation shows signs of struggle. Banditry has forced our traders into dour moods, and the rapid increase of guards has dampened the once celebrated return, and their gold is no longer bandied about in celebration, remaining in the traders' hands. Guild leaders have begun collaborating with production owners to line their pockets, leaving the workers voiceless. Prices are steadily rising, and all the while our people seem more and more reluctant to part with their precious coins, even at the cost of their health."
  hoardcurse.92.a:0 "Mine more gold, and that will smooth things over!"

  hoardcurse.93.t:0 "A Breaking Point"
  hoardcurse.93.d:0 "Gold, gold, gold! Thoughts of gold seem to be the only thoughts left in our holds! Dwarves work themselves to bone just for a few measly coins, and even then, production numbers are down across the board as some sit in their homes and cuddle bars of gold all day!\n\nMany of these bars are loans, and the banks are skyrocketing interest prices, and backing them up with thugs from local mob bosses. Food and goods are becoming scarce as all are loaded onto the trade carts. Our people are starving and desperate, as mountains of our most precious metal fill vaults across the nation. Even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is struggling to focus on the nation over investments, as more and more demand a solution. How to even begin addressing these myriad and inter-locking issues boggles the mind of [Root.Monarch.GetName]..."

From above, the metal bridges jutting across the Runelink at irregular angles, combined with the Link's circular shape, make it resemble a mighty maw, swallowing all that it can, and belching goods in exchange. Thus, it is named the Runemaw. Such is the Will of the Father.\n\nFrom below, fresh soldiers eager to fight in His name, raw materials, and the most powerful runescribes the Father can provide.

Around him other dwarves were sifting through bodies for any loose valuables and setting up a perimeter watch. The Cartel was a well oiled machine by now, barely needing Dwosgraegs’ input to function. He finished cleaning and looked around more closely. They had arrived in what looked to be an old hamlet built on the side of the rail track and had taken care of its previous occupiers. He surmised it was a fine place to rest a while before continuing deeper into the tunnels.\n\nIt had been at least a year since they had first set foot into the Serpentspine. When he was little Dwosgraeg was always fascinated by the mythical mountain range and its vast networks of caves and tunnels. Fighting in the dark depths like the dwarven heroes of old had always been one of his greatest dreams, and now he was living that dream and it was everything he had hoped for: close quarters, tight spaces, devilish ambush locations; fighting side-by-side as an impenetrable shield wall; enemies around every corner. He had never felt so alive while fighting under the sun in Escann or in the Empire. His enemies were also more in their element here, the goblins using their small stature to great effect. He relished the challenge.\n\nA burst of laughter erupted from behind Dwosgraeg. He turned to look and saw some of the dwarves were tossing spears at a corpse they had moved to be leaning on a wall. They were also saying something but Dwosgraeg did not care to listen. He approached the commotion and spoke up: “I thought I have been clear that corpses are not playthings?” All eyes were on him now. “Sir, this is not play, this is…” “Another word from you and I’ll cut your tongue clean off. I was thinking of resting here for a while but it seems there is enough energy to keep marching.” He saw some folks that had already taken their packs out shoot glares at the spear throwers. He knew that his imposing presence and unmatched skill was the only thing truly uniting this band of warrior dwarves. They were not here because some rich noble had paid them or because of homesickness. They were here to fight, loot and adventure.\n\nAfter a sufficiently long silence Dwosgraeg gave the order."

  diggy_spawnable.6.d:0 "The Dwarovar was rich, and everyone knew it. So when news came of the Greentide being broken at Rottenstep, many dwarves were overjoyed at the idea of venturing deep into the now orc-free caves of the Serpentspine and making themselves a fortune. One such attempt has already been made by Fognir Asra, who in 1410 AA led an expedition of his own into the Dwarovar in order to recover the Agate Gem. The success of the expedition led to the creation of the Asra Bank, and no other dwarf was in a better position than Jarmun, a member of the Asra clan and a relative of Fognir, to start an expedition of his own. This time however, the goal would be completely different: Instead of reclaiming a single gem, they would be reclaiming the whole Serpentspine.\n\nAssembling an adventurer band and getting the funds was no problem; there were many dwarves thinking that they were entitled to some share of their ancestors’ wealth, and Asra Bank was more than happy to provide funding to their brethren. The real issue was the fact that none of these “adventurers” knew what was actually happening inside the caverns. Many dwarves that fled Khugdihr after the hold was broken in 1424 AA were still alive, but even they did not know what awaited them deeper in the mountain. Despite all of this, the Second Asra Expedition was assembled and was ready to face whatever dangers were guarding their ancient homes.\n\nAfter entering Khugdihr through its broken gates, the expedition was met by a small squatter goblin tribe. They obviously stood no chance against the sheer numbers of the dwarves, and the hold was quickly liberated. But they didn’t come here for prestige or glory: they came here for riches.\n\nNow the expedition has left Khugdihr and stands at the beginning of the great Dwarovrod. Morale is high, and the Asra Bank’s funding allows them to stay in the caverns indefinitely. And despite the Asra Bank’s charter explicitly stating that “profits must take precedence over prestige or any idea of “Dwarven glory”, many in the expedition are wondering:"

From a young age he wanted to emulate his ancestors, and often fantasised about being the dwarf who would find the Ruby Gem once lost with the Dwarovkron to the orcs who now lurked in the ancestral home of all dwarves.\n\nKûrgûm was not alone in his ambition, however. Long had there been dwarves within Rubyhold who were eager to reclaim the ancient glory of Aul-Dwarov. This small group of  dwarves, known as the Ruby Reclaimers, were characterised not only by their rowdy zeal but also by their disdain for the old gods of the dwarven pantheon. Instead, they directed their worship toward their dwarven ancestors and their achievements. Kûrgûm's affinity with the Ruby Reclaimers led him to joining their ranks, and his passion for finding the Ruby Gem made him famous among them.\n\nWith the arrival of news of the Greentide, the ever vocal Ruby Reclaimers grew louder than ever before, as more and more young dwarves became eager to reclaim their ancestral homeland in the Serpentspine. News that their rivals in Silverforge had organised several expeditions to the Serpentspine, and that even the Asra Bank had funded a second expedition into the mountains only exacerbated the situation.\n\nWith his charisma and zeal Kûrgûm quickly became the most important leader of the Ruby Reclaimers who wanted to form an expedition to the Serpentspine, using the search for the Ruby Gem as a rallying point for his followers. When King Gronmar Redstone saw the problems this fervour could bring to Rubyhold, he decided to meet with Kûrgûm and after a long negotiation of terms the Ruby Company was born to find the finest ruby ever mined and reclaim their ancestors' homeland.\n\nThe Ruby Company has made a long journey from Rubyhold to the Serpentspine, and now they are here, at the gates of Verkal Kozenad, to find the Ruby Gem."

Any mithril arms and armor that was sold was carefully cataloged with the Cartel's archivists and tracked diligently to make sure as little of the precious metal was lost as possible. Even with their careful bookkeeping, however, with no new mithril flowing from the Serpentspine following the Greentide, the Cartel’s economic niche lessened as mithril was lost to the multitudes of conflicts being waged during the 15th century. But while on the one hand the Greentide threatened the end of the Mithril-Arm Cartel’s trade altogether, on the other hand it presented an opportunity like no other. Now, the ancient mines of the Dwarovar were abandoned once more and a new chance arose to prospect for new veins of mithril ore, and with new ore they could fire up the old forges and make more of the precious metal themselves.\n\nSo with the last of their money spent on supplies, the Mithril-Arm Cartel set out for the Serpentspine. Along with them they brought the tools they had used to determine the quality and purity of mithril and their well-kept manuals on mithril upkeep. Armed with this knowledge they, with their leader Bertus Mirth-Arm, fought their way into the depths. After a long and arduous expedition they have finally found what they have been looking for: a fresh vein of mithril."

Based in Rubyhold, the company operated as justice-for-hire for centuries; reclaiming lost inheritances and burying long dead hatchets - for a tidy sum, of course. \n\nWith the end of Dookanson and his Greentide came a new opportunity, however., A chance to venture back into the Serpentspine and avenge the wrongs perpetrated against Aul-Dwarov. Yet, with so many grudges,  discord soon sprang within the group as of which insult to avenge first. The list was long, with nearly ten thousand years of history buried in the rock and blood of the mountains. From petty criminal disputes to the devastation caused by those who tried to conquer the mountains, each hold was haunted by the ghost of innumerable slights and each new recruit brought with them hand-me-down tales of more. \n\nThis cycle was broken with the arrival of Belgrak Cavedelver. Belgrak, legendary warrior of Corin’s Circle, left the normally rowdy halls in silent reverence. Lifting a tankard, he threw his own suggestion into the debates - the holds of the Middle Dwarovar had a unique history. It had been devastated by orcs and goblins but it also held scars from the elves outside of the mountain, their Burned Empress once turning dwarf against dwarf inside their own homes and sacking once resplendent halls beyond recognition in their lust for the wealth of the mountains. With a final slam of the tankard on his table, the band erupted in approval of the scheme and rushed to draw up their plans for the expedition.\n\nFollowing Belgrak, the Company has arrived in the Middle Dwarovar with a list of wrongs on their minds, ready to replay each drop of blood spilled in kind."

  diggy_spawnable.10.d:0 "When Began Stormhammer was a child, his grandfather gave him a coin. It was an unassuming thing, its only defining feature being its antiquity. His grandfather's father had, apparently, made it himself, carving the face of some ancient, barely-remembered Dwarovic monarch onto one side of the copper. Once, perhaps, it had been perfectly weighted. Now, as Began idly flipped it as he gazed over the Sea of Echoes, it seemed to favour the carved edge.\n\nOvdal Tûngr was hardly the worst place to live. Though the sea air disagreed with him about as much as the boats themselves, dwarven culture still held strong. He had grown up here, and had a home for himself, taking whatever work he could find that didn't involve stepping foot onto one of those infernal ships. He'd sold fish. He'd worked to deepen the hold. He'd carried huge planks of timber down to the drydocks. When he was a boy, his mother had joked that he'd been born without sea legs. Life was calm. Peaceful.\n\nSomething unpleasant burned in his chest. Something familiar, and not. Something the sea hadn't been able to quell.\n\nShazstundihr was tauntingly close. On clear days, if he climbed the Gulangor mountains high enough to see between their peaks, the summits of the Serpentreach were visible. Even now, decades after his predecessors fled from those ancient halls, Began could feel something inexplicably drawing him back towards them. He flipped the coin once more, eyeing the face in his palm as it gazed back imperiously. When he was a child, it had been a pleasant, burnished orange. Now, in the salty, damp air of Ovdal Tûngr, it had turned a strange blueish-green.\n\nPerhaps, if Began was wholly made of copper, he'd have been able to change like his coin. Unfortunately for the squatters that remained in the Serpentreach, his blood was mixed with the colour of marble."

Many more were, characteristically, muddled by an overindulgence in ale - the same vice that led to them losing the key back inside. Some, though, remember hiding their tears of shame with their beards, bemoaning the fate that had now, finally, reached every corner of the Serpetspine. They remember the sunlight; warm and unfamiliar, as it brushed against their skin like an unwelcome friend. These sober ones amongst them had to remind the others not to look directly at it, as they made their way to Sharaja.\n\nTheir new city was a good one. Filled with precious gems, it was almost close enough to their home to become their next. The people there were sceptical, but quickly warmed to their masterful craftsmanship; especially once their kegs finally ran dry. Years passed. The dwarves gifted their new neighbours advanced medicine, delicious ale, new methods of irrigation.\n\nThe dwarves watched as the days passed; as the sunshine suffused and split apart in the gemstones of Sharaja, their colours almost seeming to glow as bright as fresh dye. But still, it wasn't home. Still, those colours would simply bleed into white. Still, the Amethyst Dwarves longed.\n\nNow, news has reached them. Far, far in the west, a grand adventure to retake the Serpentspine is underway. Already some mighty holds have been repaired, with their squatters forced out and their original citizens resettled. Although many of those who fled have passed on, a great many more see this news as a sign to retake their old home. Though Hul-az-Krakasol is still locked, Grozumdihr remains open - a door to the past, and now, the future. With Sharaja wishing them well, they step back into the mountains, bidding goodbye to the haunting light once again.\n\nThe dank darkness of the Tree of Stone had always been a more welcoming friend."

  diggy_spawnable.12.d:0 "First cousin once removed of the Lord-Elector of Silverforge, Duran Blueshield spent his youth wandering the world, from the edge of the Deepwoods to the city of Anbenncóst, from the island of Nimscodd to the Winebay and the Sorncóst. Yet as he aged, his wanderlust and fascination with ruins and history only grew; He visited the white walls of Castanor, he crossed through the flooded fields and cities of the gnoll-infested marshlands south of Corvuria, he gazed upon the infamous tower that was once the heart of Black Castanor, and yet no matter how many sights he saw or stories he uncovered, it could never truly satisfy him.\n\nHe wanted to see the Dwarovar. The orc-infested Serpentspine mountains hid a vast realm of dwarven cities larger than any human Metropolis, many-pillared halls of stone dug deeper than the mountains were tall. All he ever truly wanted to do before he died was see those ancient halls, even just once… but as long as Orcs still ruled the Serpentspine, it was only a dream.\n\n… And then, one day whilst visiting the western Dwarves of Rubyhold, he heard some news. The Orcish warlord, Korgus Dookanson, had declared war on the surface world, pouring across the subcontinent of Escann in a vengeful crusade in the name of their God, the Great Dookan. But only one detail echoed in Duran's mind, to the point of obsession. The Serpentspine mountains had been emptied of orcs.\n\nIn the Lorentish small country, in the town of Thomsbridge, he held a meeting between a number of relatives, adventurers, a wizard, and their halfling host. An agreement was made, a contract signed, and the Company of Duran Blueshield was formed. He knew that there would never be an opportunity like this, ever again. He was not going to wait for the looters to destroy everything before he could see it, and if the Gods… no… if the Ancestors willed it, he would stop at nothing to reclaim, and reforge the homelands he had never known.\n\nYears later, after a harrowing journey through the caves and roads of the Dwarovar, the company has finally reached what was once the heart of the ancient Empire of Aul-Dwarov. The quest for the Dwarven homeland has only just begun."

  diggy_spawnable.13.d:0 "A single shard.\n\nDug out from a ditch of gore and filth, but in the waning dawn light, it shined. Khuznoli Hammerfall had found that little splinter of mithril amidst the remains of an Orcish chief after a rearguard action against the Greentide, and he took it back home to the halls and taverns of Silverforge. The shard had captured something within him, and set alight a simple idea.\n\n'Think of what we lost', he told his kin. 'Think of what we could reclaim if we simply returned home'. It was not a mere delving expedition into the Dwarovar that he proposed, but the full scale resettlement and reconquest of the ancient holds - so that no dwarf might wonder at what had been lost.\n\nFirst, the young apprentices joined him. They were young, ambitious, chafing under ancient clan dogma. When Khuznoli presented the shard, they would pass it about them, their boastful grunts silent.\n\nThen the craftsmen, thrown out to starve when the demand for Dwarven weaponry started to dry up. We've longbeards on our chins, they said, but imagine a time where no dwarf might go hungry, for the workings of steel and fire.\n\nLast, veterans of the Lilac Wars, who brought the knowledge of war and the grit to hold on in the dark. They said little, but they hefted battleworn axes and knew Khuznoli's worn expression as one of a dwarf that had seen the wrong end of a fight. A trustworthy sight.\n\nThey called themselves the Forgemaster Union. Khuznoli Hammerfall vowed to lead them into the dark of their ancestral homes and find some shred of the legacies of their forefathers. As they made their way into the depths, dwarfs who had been broken were made whole again. Tortured souls were set free. Old feet took on a quickened step. All with the idea that one day, they might take back for their sons what had been ripped away from their forefathers.\n\nCornered in the dark, with goblins all about them, the Union prepares to take back what is their birthright."

As the Dwarovar burned around us, admist the chaos of orc and goblin invasions, we closed our gates, and waited. Now, however, the time for waiting has ended. We must go out, reclaim the Dwarovar, and build a great Dwarven nation once more! Out of our populace emerge three factions, the Reclaimers, the Expansionists, and the [Root.GetAdjective] Guard.\n\nThe Reclaimers share a vision of a great capital, a beautiful and magnificent hold like the stories of Aul-Dwarov mention, monumental megastructures that reach deep down into Halann, towards the very center of the world. It is their belief that only through these artistic and architectural endeavours we can ensure that our society shall not fail again.\n\nThe Expansionists advocate for a massive colonization effort into the old dwarven railways, the veins and arteries of Aul-Dwarov, and the many caverns that line these roads. By ensuring that these regions are safe, they say, we can sleep soundly again, knowing that no orc, no goblin can assault us again.\n\nThe [Root.GetAdjective] Guard stands for our military might, combat prowess, and tactical superiority. To ensure that the Last Days of the Dwarovar, the thousand-year decline of our old empire within the mountains of the Serpentspine, will never repeat we need to be better prepared for the dangers that still lurk outside of our gates. Only with a well-equipped army can we ensure the safety of our hold.\n\nAt last there are also the Beholden, a group of older dwarves who oppose this endeavour, both out of fear of the dangers ahead and outside, as well as a hatred of any and all change to our country.

Referred to as the Dwarovkron, the crown was shattered at the end of the orcish siege of Amldihr, and its gems lost in the vast darkness of the Serpentspine. Over the millenia some of these gems have been recovered, while others still lay undisturbed within deep caverns and ancient dungeons. Any who possess all seven great gems and the kronium circlet itself can attempt to reforge the fabled crown and take this ancient symbol of legitimacy and power for themselves."
