 F43_calling_on_the_faithful_title:0 "Calling on the Faithful"
 F43_calling_on_the_faithful_desc:0 "The gnollish scourge that infests our rightful homeland is not one that can be easily defeated. Only with the light of Surael can the faithful hope to triumph—but faith alone cannot win a war. Alone Zanšap is weak, and our present army is unlikely to pose a threat to the dreaded hordes of Tluukt. We must call for all true children of Surael to take up our banner and join our holy war against the darkness. It is unlikely many will answer—we have yet to prove that our cause is backed by more than words—but there will be some brave souls that do. They will have to be enough."
 
 F43_dream_of_the_sur_title:0 "Dream of the Sur"
 F43_dream_of_the_sur_desc:0 "Ages ago, the Šadnatu Akalate stretched throughout the whole of the Šad Sur. Those days are long gone. Though the east has fallen to gnollish invaders, Irrliam has kept Zanšap safe from any further incursions. But the War of the Ember Queens decades ago left Irrliam devastated, Medurubar a sea of blood, and the remaining lands of the Sur Mountains in the hands of the ruthless Eliznans. If we are to realize Bavar the Third’s dream of a unified Šad Sur, the great wrong the Eliznans have committed against us must be reversed.. Though they are not gnolls, we will expel them from our home all the same. It will not be easy, but Surael is with us, so we will triumph."
 
 F43_our_furture_title:0 "Our Future"
 F43_our_furture_desc:0 "In the year 1319, the last remnants of Šadnatu pledged loyalty to King Taelarios of Irrliam in exchange for protection from the gnollish scourge that destroyed our once great Akalate. Since then, we have served Irrliam as a loyal vassal state from the city of Zanšap, and Taelarios held to his word and kept us safe. Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever. Our trust was with Taelarios, not Irrliam—with his death, we can no longer be sure that our new liege will provide the same stability and protection that he once did. If we sit back and act indecisively, we could easily fall into ruin, nothing more than another conquest for the history books. We will ever be grateful to Taelarios for his protection, but from now on the Šadnatu will decide our own destiny!"
 
 F43_shadows_loom_title:0 "Shadows Loom"
 F43_shadows_loom_desc:0 "We have heard tales from Far Bulwar, and it seems Surael’s light has begun to flicker. To the southeast of Sareyand, a gnollish conqueror has built up a kingdom of filth and barbarity that has surpassed that of even Tluukt when she still lived, seeking dominance over the whole of the desert. Worse yet, far in the east a false prophet claiming to be the son of Jexis herself has created a growing cult, preaching a heresy that proclaims any simple devotee can be a Chosen. No matter which one stands victorious in the end, this has the potential to be the greatest threat Šad Sur has yet encountered. If we are not prepared to face the danger that lies to the east, all that we have achieved thus far could once again be lost. May Surael protect us"
 
 F43_bring_surael_light_east_title:0 "Bring Surael Light East"
 F43_bring_surael_light_east_desc:0 "For as long as gnolls and heretics terrorize the faithful of Bulwar, Šad Sur can never be safe, and Surael shall look down upon us in disappointment. We must return His light to these lands, by force if necessary. In His name, it is time to expand our crusade to the whole of the continent. Our armies have proven triumphant against the servants of the Malevolent Dark in eastern Salahad, and we now hold in our hands the stronghold of the False Prophet, cursed be his name. Let us send an unforgettable message to those who oppose His light!"
 
 F43_salahad_guides_title:0 "Salahad Guides"
 F43_salahad_guides_desc:0 "The Mašnsih are much like us, in a way. Both our peoples have suffered greatly at the hands of the gnolls, forced to flee their lands and rely on elven protection. But while we had Taelarios in all his kindness and wisdom to protect us, the Mašnsih were forced to submit to the heresy of the False Prophet. Now that we have liberated them and returned them to the light of Surael, we will give to them what He has given to us: a true homeland. All we ask of the in return is that they use their knowledge of the desert to guide our armies through the treacherous sands of the Salahad, so we can liberate yet more children of Surael."
 
 F43_state_and_sorcery_title:0 "State and Sorcery"
 F43_state_and_sorcery_desc:0 "Two problems face Šad Sur. Firstly, it is the will of Surael that His human faithful leave magic to the Chosen, so as a land run by humans we have little access to any form of magical utility. Secondly, with our recent conquest of Muhaqaar we have been left with a significant number of mages who yet deny Surael’s light, choosing to remain loyal to the Khet. It does not take Jaher himself to realize these two problems may have the same solution."
 
 F43_planting_kasyaru_title:0 "Planting Kasyaru"
 F43_planting_kasyaru_desc:0 "When one thinks of the city of Zanšap, they think of Kasiyaru. Though the Kasiyaru flower cannot be grown anywhere but the city, as Surael Himself has uniquely blessed our soil, its spice is so valued that it is known as far as Cannor and Haless. Even with its limited cultivation, Kasiyaru production still remains a cornerstone of Šad Sur’s economy. But Surael must have rewarded our cleverness in creating the Black Academy, for its mages have recently discovered a way to grow the Kasiyaru flower in virtually any farmland. If we construct plantations along the Sorrow using this new method, riches beyond imagining will no doubt flow to us."

 F43_sadnatu_birthright_title:0 "Sadnatu Birthright"
 F43_sadnatu_birthright_desc:0 "Tluukt. There are none in Zanšap who do not despise that name. While we are forced to wait here in our last city, gazing up at the mountains we once called home and pining for what was stolen, that Surael-forsaken gnoll sits in the ruins of our civilization and laughs from upon her throne of filth! We have suffered for centuries, but no more! No longer shall we sit back as vile servants of the Malevolent Dark defile our ancient lands! We shall gather every last child of the ruined Akalate of Šad Sur, every last child of Surael who is willing to fight for His light, and we shall purge the gnollish scourge from our homeland! The odds seem insurmountable, but as long as Surael is with us, we cannot fail!"
 
 F43_avenge_the_akal_title:0 "Avenge the Akal"
 F43_avenge_the_akal_desc:0 "There were some who had thought this day would never come, but Surael rewards His faithful. The gnollish scourge lies broken, driven from the lands of Šad Sur! Our soldiers cornered the vile Tluukt herself as she tried to flee south to regroup, and no amount of foul magic could save her from Surael’s judgment. With the slayer of Bavar the Third dead and the ruins of Ekluzagnu back in rightful Šadnatu hands, our future finally looks bright. Surael be praised!"
 
 F43_sad_sur_whole_again_title:0 "Sad Sur Whole Again"
 F43_sad_sur_whole_again_desc:0 "While Šad Sur is now ours, there are still a number of gnolls that skulk within the shadows of the mountains, determined to remain despite the death of their tyrant. Some say we should show them mercy, but did they show us mercy when they razed our homes and slaughtered our children? If we are to have peace, we must purge these stragglers by any means necessary. Once they are gone, only then can we rest knowing our people are finally safe. May Surael ensure that darkness never once again falls upon us. If today is the greatest day in the history of the Šadnatu, let tomorrow be even greater."
 
 F43_sad_sur_stands_bright_title:0 "Sad Sur Stands Bright"
 F43_sad_sur_stands_bright_desc:0 "For the first time in centuries, the Šadnatu have managed to push the gnolls from our homeland. We have won, but our work does not end here. If we simply rest on our laurels, it will only be a matter of time before the servants of darkness return and we are once again driven from the Sur Mountains. It is only through Surael’s grace that we have triumphed—we will prove we are worthy of His blessing. We must resettle our ancient lands, rebuild our ruined cities, and create a kingdom that will never again fall to the Malevolent Dark."
 
 F43_zeolats_in_the_akalate_title:0 "Zealots in the Akalate"
 F43_zeolats_in_the_akalate_desc:0 "The Order of the Zenith was instrumental in our victory against the gnollish scourge. It is only natural that they now expect to be rewarded for their help. With Taelarios’s death, their future is unclear, so they have come to us with a deal. They will pledge complete loyalty to Šad Sur and the Akal in exchange for a far greater level of influence over our civil and religious affairs than they ever had in Irrliam. While some are reluctant to grant the Order such power, we cannot deny the debt we owe them. We are simply in no position to refuse."
 
 F43_reclaiming_our_might_title:0 "Reclaiming our Might"
 F43_reclaiming_our_might_desc:0 "Those who look back at the history of Šad Sur and see only our defeat at the hands of the gnolls are either fools or blind. Long ago, even the great kings of Akalšes were forced to bow before us. When an unending tide of gnolls drove Bulwar to its knees, we were the last of the Akalates to fall, for the might of Surael was with us. When Jaher spread His light across the whole of Halann, we stood at his right hand, his most loyal soldiers. The strength of the Šadnatu is unquestionable, but the servants of the Malevolent Dark seem to have forgotten that. Perhaps it is time we remind them."
 
 F43_salahad_crusade_title:0 "Salahad Crusade"
 F43_salahad_crusade_desc:0 "Twice now have the barbaric gnolls overrun our lands. Twice has the great fortress-city of Ekluzagnu been brought to ruin, turned into a trophy for the forces of evil. Twice now has the Malevolent Dark tried to snuff out the Šadnatu, and twice it has failed, for the light of Surael can never be extinguished. Now, it is our turn. Šad Sur shall march south, and the whole of the Salahad shall be illuminated by His light. The gnolls will know the very same fear they once brought to us. They may have won twice, but we will only need to win once."
 
 F43_gnollsbane_title:0 "Gnollsbane"
 F43_gnollsbane_desc:0 "Millenia ago, the great Castan Beastbane freed Bulwar from the gnolls, driving them from the whole of the continent. But it is clear that he ultimately failed. In time, he passed from this plane, the empire of Castanor crumbled to dust, and the servants of the Malevolent Dark crept from their blight to terrorize the children of Surael once more. We will learn from his mistakes, and finish what he ultimately started all those years ago. Gnollkind is a stain on the whole of Halann, and it falls to us to cleanse it. After all, is it not the duty of Surael’s faithful to spread His light to every last shadow?"
 
 F43_sarhal_overseers_title:0 "Sarhal Overseers"
 F43_sarhal_overseers_desc:0 "The Mother’s Sorrow now flows along Šad Sur’s border, dividing Surael’s Garden from the gnollish scourge that lies beyond. While some may use this as an excuse to lower their guard, we know the Malevolent Dark better than that. We shall establish unbreakable fortifications along the length of the river to ensure no servant of darkness can ever cross alive. The local Khets know the threat posed by the gnolls as well as we do—no doubt they would be more than willing to help by keeping their gaze pointed west."
 
 F43_establish_the_bronze_road_title:0 "Establish the Bronze Road"
 F43_establish_the_bronze_road_desc:0 "In the time of Jaher, the great Golden Highway was built from east to west, allowing easy passage across the Far Salahad to feed his conquests in Haless. It is a shame he never marched south, as we could use a Golden Highway of our own. We do not have the wealth of the Phoenix Empire, but we do have the resources of Šad Sur—perhaps that is enough. We will build not a Golden Highway but a Bronze Road, allowing fresh supplies to easily reach our armies south of the Salahad. Jaher would be proud!"
 
 F43_call_of_the_salahad_title:0 "Call of the Salahad"
 F43_call_of_the_salahad_desc:0 "When Surael granted the Chosen knowledge of their long-lost homeland, many elves chose to leave Bulwar behind and start new lives across the sea. Our liberation of Sarhal has created large swaths of empty land, now freed from gnollish defilement. Just as the Chosen resettled Aelantir, large numbers of human settlers have begun to travel south, seeking to repopulate this new land in the name of Surael. Some claim Bulwar is our only true home…but the faithful know our true home is wherever His Light shines."
 
 F43_our_place_in_this_world_title:0 "Our Place in this World"
 F43_our_place_in_this_world_desc:0 "If Bavar the Third and Taelarios were alive to see all the Šadnatu have accomplished, no doubt they would weep with joy. It was not long ago when we lay broken and defeated within the city of Zanšap, forced to rely on Irrliam’s generosity to protect us from the darkness. How far we have come! Now Surael’s Garden has come to encompass the whole of the Salahad, the few surviving gnolls cower in fear in their crumbling packs, and Šad Sur once again stands united under our glorious Akalate. The divided rulers of Bulwar look upon us in envy, knowing we are Surael’s most devoted subjects. Now that we can be sure the Malevolent Dark will never again threaten the Garden, it is time to deal with those who care more about their petty politics than their faith in Him."
 
 F43_rally_the_order_title:0 "Rally the Order"
 F43_rally_the_order_desc:0 "Few names strike more fear into the hearts of Surael’s enemies than the Order of the Zenith. With all that we have lost, it is perhaps the one bit of pride that still remains for the Šadnatu. Though the Order is subject to none but Taelarios, they are still Zanšapi at heart. If we are to stand against the gnollish scourge, we must call upon their loyalty to their home and convince them to fight alongside us, unified under the banner of the Akal. They will surely expect great rewards if we are victorious, but we will pay any price to reclaim our homeland! May the faithful of Surael stand ever united against the Malevolent Dark!"
 
 F43_arming_the_zansapi_title:0 "Arming the Zansapi"
 F43_arming_the_zansapi_desc:0 "When Bavar the Third led his ill-fated march into the den of the beast, he brought with him the whole of Zanšap’s military strength. With his death, we were left near-defenseless, ever more dependent on the charity of Taelarios to protect us from the complete destruction of our Akalate. While we have made great progress in rebuilding our strength, we must ensure our triumph over Tluukt does not leave us complacent. If we are to spread the light of Surael to the whole of the Salahad, we will need an army that surpasses any ever seen in our history. Never again shall the Šadnatu be left defenseless!"
 
 F43_twice_destroyed_thrice_rebuild_title:0 "Twice Destroyed, Thrice Rebuilt"
 F43_twice_destroyed_thrice_rebuild_desc:0 "Ekluzagnu! The jewel of Šad Sur, capital of our people for nearly a millennium! Through its long history, the fortress-city has seen many rulers—the ancient Djinn, the vile darkness-serving Xhazobines, even the bronze dragon Aakhet—but the Šadnatu have proven to be its true suzerains. Though the gnollish scourge has razed its great stonework to the ground twice now, Ekluzagnu cannot truly be destroyed while the children of Surael yet live. It may have been little more than ruins when we reclaimed it, but there is no ruin that cannot be rebuilt with time. Soon, the Stone Palace will gleam with the pride of our people once more!"
 
 F43_sunkissed_jewel_title:0 "Sunkissed Jewel"
 F43_sunkissed_jewel_desc:0 "Less than a century ago, Ekluzagnu was little more than a pile of rubble and filth. Now, there is no more beautiful sight in the whole of Bulwar! Carved out of the mountain itself, the very rock the city is sculpted from seems to flourish with life, from the bustling streets and merchants of the Hewn Bazaar at the lowest levels to the shimmering light that reflects off the polish of Eduz-Elluzamer above. At the center of it all lies the Stone Palace, a masterwork of shining pillars and walls, with statues of our past Akals integrated directly into the structure itself. The city’s entire layout is tiered and organized in such a way that the midday sun illuminates all but the most hidden pieces of architecture, causing it to gleam as a flawless jewel to those who gaze up at it from beyond the glistening walls. All who see Ekluzagnu shall know the glory of Surael, humbled by His light!"
 
 F43_uplift_the_broken_title:0 "Uplift the Broken"
 F43_uplift_the_broken_desc:0 "We were not the only Akalate to be shattered by the gnollish scourge, imprisoned within the bounds of a single city with the Malevolent Dark at our very doorstep. Dasmatuš knows the same despair we once did, and it is our duty as Surael’s faithful to look after our fellow children. We shall offer them protection and safety for their fealty, as Taelarios once did for us. It is true that they still cling on to heretical beliefs, yet to abandon the long-outdated tenets that predated Jaher’s landing, but that is of little importance. Were we not ignorant too, before the Chosen granted us Surael’s wisdom? It is never too late to learn, and they will learn in time."
 
 F43_davharral_supplies_title:0 "Davharral Supplies"
 F43_davharral_supplies_desc:0 "Rahen and Haless hold great riches, and Jaher knew that well. It is only through the wealth of the east that Surael’s greatest empire achieved its splendor. Trying to replicate Jaher’s conquests would be a foolish endeavor, but we do not need to—it is better to leave the plundering to our merchants, rather than our armies. For now, we shall limit our expansion to Davharral, the gateway between east and west, so that we can take a cut of all trade that reaches the Salahad. Once more will eastern riches fund the spread of Surael’s light!"
 
 F43_so_called_civilized_gnolls_title:0 "So Called Civilized Gnolls"
 F43_so_called_civilized_gnolls_desc:0 "The Order of the Zenith tell us time and time again that gnollkind is nothing more than a tool of the Malevolent Dark, and yet our conquest of the hordes of Haraagtseda have revealed something intriguing. Not only do the gnolls here claim to have abandoned their worship of the demons of darkness, but they even seek to portray themselves as a civilized people! Some have even shown willing to listen to Surael’s truths, though the Elatšari assure us this is little more than a deceitful ruse. They have come to us with words rather than swords, so we will grant them the same respect, as Surael is merciful. But they are still gnolls at heart, and the great suffering they have inflicted upon the Šadnatu can not be so easily forgotten. We must be careful."
 
 F43_third_city_title:0 "Third City"
 F43_third_city_desc:0 "It is the will of Surael that Ekluzagnu be the shining jewel of Šad Sur, and Zanšap shall forever be its second. However, both of these cities lie north of the Salahad. Our Akalate now stretches far into the heartland of Sarhal, and it has become necessary to create a central location from which we can organize our administration of the region. The formerly gnollish city of Kvangraak is now in our hands, and we must admit it would serve this purpose perfectly. Let us fund its reconstruction, encourage settlers from the north to repopulate it, and turn it into a city worthy of the Šadnatu. It cannot compare to the twin prides of Šad Sur quite yet, but perhaps one day it will."
 
 F43_barsan_of_the_east_title:0 "Brasan of the East"
 F43_barsan_of_the_east_desc:0 "Under the graceful hand of Šad Sur, Dasmatuš has flourished. Ships from three continents now grace its dockyards on a regular basis, and goods from as far as Yanshen can be easily found within its markets. Some even give it the moniker ‘Brasan of the East,’ for the wealth of the city is beginning to rival that of the great ports that lie on the shores of the eastern Divenhal. With a few well placed investments, we can ensure that Dasmatuš will grow to dominate all trade within the Gulf of Rahen"

The Salahad is wide and dry, and in order to transport supplies and food to our holy vanguard, we need myriad things: pack animals, water, camp materials, and a firm foundation upon which to travel. We will create a grand route, connecting the numerous oases and urban areas to our forces. We will create a bronze road, the arteries of the righteous Salahad Crusade."
 
#Events
 flavor_zansap.1.t: "Our Future"
 flavor_zansap.1.d: "The mountains burn. The righteous fury of Surael thunders throughout the Šad Sur. The bloodthirsty gnolls have been burnt from their cowardly hideouts by our virtuous Elatšari, the instruments of the divine Surael. However, this triumph rings hollow, as so many still languish under the Malevolent Dark in Bulwar, whether it be corrupt elven bureaucrats that have forsaken Surael, traitorous heathens in the mountains, or monstrous races ruling over and abusing our brethren. However, we are still recovering from the horrid oppression of the gnollish savages. Villages are empty, and fields are left untilled and in flames. We must consolidate if we wish to ever defeat the Malevolent Dark and their agents…"
 flavor_zansap.1.a: "The trials of Surael are infinite, as is his reward."
 
 flavor_zansap.2.t: "Traitors of the Faith"
 flavor_zansap.2.d: "Oh happy day! We have seen our greatest victory since the death of the wretched Tluukt. The bastardly Jaddari have been bested entirely in the open field and we have found almost all of the heathenish leadership, and they will be put on trial in accordance to Surael’s will. However, after their gross abuses of power, idolatry, and heretical behaviour, there is certainly only one sentencing possible: death. They will be burnt at the stake, as is fit for their heresy. It is only through the cleansing flames of the all-powerful Surael that their light may ever join Surael’s great radiance.. However, we have saved one heathen for a special fate. Jaddar, the bastardous claimant to the divine throne of Jaher, Jarael, and Jexis, has done more to harm the cause of our righteous crusade than any gnoll or harpy through his claiming of divinity and misleading thousands of souls across the Salahad. He has atrociously misused his Surael-given life, and for that, he will be punished. A great pyre had already been gathered, his ashes spread upon the djinn-cursed landscape by the burning of his sinful body. Surael smiles upon the mountains."
 flavor_zansap.2.a: "The Malevolent Dark grows weaker, through our actions, through our sacrifices."
 
 flavor_zansap.3.t: "Black Academy"
 flavor_zansap.3.d: "The mage shifted in place nervously, the clanking of his chains echoing off the cold stone walls. He stared at the Elatšar in front of him with a mixture of fear and suspicion in his eyes. ‘You’re saying you’ll let me go, just like that? I don’t even have to worship that… sun god of yours?’\n\nEven with the blatant disrespect shown to Surael, the face of the Elatšar showed no emotion. ‘Yes. You will be allowed to keep your heathenry, and you will be given food, shelter, and the freedom to practice your magical arts.’\n\nIt seemed too good to be true. Just weeks earlier, he had been beaten to an inch of his life by the Order of the Zenith’s lackeys and dragged to this miserable cell for refusing to submit to that damned sun cult of theirs. This had to be some kind of trick. ‘So what’s the catch?’\n\n‘The catch is that you will pledge your loyalty to Šad Sur, and follow all orders given to you unquestionably. All you do will be for the glory of Surael, even if you refuse to follow Him. Do we have an understanding?’\n\n‘And what if I don’t want to be one of your lackeys?’\n\nThe Elatšar calmly lifted up the ledger in his hand and began to read from it. ‘Esia ges Axamosdat. Accused of consorting with known rebels and refusing to accept Surael’s light. In custody of the Order for eight days. Execution date set to—’\n\n‘NO!’ screamed the mage, futilely lurching forward against his chains. Tears filled his eyes. ‘Don’t hurt her! Please, I’ll do anything you want! She’s all I have left. Just don’t hurt her. Please….’\n\nFor the first time since entering the cell, the Elatšar showed a glint of emotion. A cruel smile spread across his lips."
 flavor_zansap.3.a: "I’m glad we could come to an agreement."
 
 flavor_zansap.4.t: "Zanšap in Disarray"
 flavor_zansap.4.d: "Ten years ago, Akal Bavar III szal-Barseen dreamt of an end to the constant gnollish raids that plagued the faithful of Bulwar. He dreamt of a unified Šad Sur, one that all Šadnatu could call home, one that would never again fall to the Malevolent Dark. And so, he gathered a great host and marched into the mountains, resolved to overthrow the vile packmistress known as Tluukt.\n\nNot a single survivor ever returned.\n\nBavar’s sole son Jareer was little more than a baby when his father was slain, leaving the Palace of Flowers in the hands of a regency that has shown no ability to solve the countless problems that face the Zanšapi. Endless waves of Šadnatu refugees poured into the city, seeking safety from the gnolls in the last remnants of our once great Akalate. Our infrastructure has been pushed to its breaking point, with thousands living on the streets in impromptu shelters, barely managing to avoid starvation. We have only just begun to fix the complete destruction of our army a decade ago, leaving us completely dependent on Irrliam to protect us from the forces of darkness on our border. As long as Taelarios lives we know we will be safe, but he is old even for an elf, and soon Surael will call him to rest.\n\nNow, Zanšap finds itself at the darkest moment in perhaps the whole of its history. If we do not act fast, the final remnant of the great Akalate of Šad Sur will crumble under the weight of the forces that surround us, and our people will lose their last chance of reclaiming their home from the gnollish scourge. But despite the odds, hope has not yet abandoned the hearts of the Zanšapi. For we are the faithful of Surael, the children of His garden, and no servants of the Malevolent Dark can keep us from our rightful homes! With His blessing, we will avenge the death of Bavar the Third and see the cowardly Tluukt face the judgment of Surael! Šad Sur will once more be united under our rule, never to be lost again! Praise Surael, and may His enemies fall before us!"
 flavor_zansap.4.a: "Surael tests us. We will prove worthy."
 
 flavor_zansap.5.t: "Celebrating Umaslu"
 flavor_zansap.5.d: "Evening has nearly arrived in the city of Zanšap, and large crowds have gathered to gaze upon Zaligalm Hill. The Akal sits leisurely with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family on the balcony of the Palace of Flowers, just as excited as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects. Something important would be happening soon; it had been close to occurring yesterday, but the angle was just barely off. Far in the distance, Surael grows tired, and the autumn sun begins to dip beneath the towering mountains of Šad Sur. The people of the city stand in the streets patiently, taking in the cool evening air with bated breath as darkness slowly creeps towards the hillside. But they do not have to wait long, as the excited murmuring slowly turns into cheering and revelry. As the shadow of the mountains rests upon the hill, it takes a familiar shape: a sheep!\n\nFor the first time since Šad Sur’s reclamation, Umašlu has arrived! Until now, the practice had been limited to the city of Zanšap, but it seems the Šadnatu who have returned to our homeland still wish to observe the event. Across the entire Akalate, the teachings of Surael are being followed to the letter, so that He may have the strength to ward away the long nights. Plans are already being made for great feasts of lamb when the winter solstice—the titular Day of the Sheep—comes next month. The whole of Šad Sur has been blessed with a mood of jollity and happiness. No amount of suffering was enough to extinguish the hope of our people, and now that our hardships have passed, it shines bright enough to warm even the coldest winter night!"

 flavor_zansap.6.t: "Salahad Cursade"
 flavor_zansap.6.d: "From Ekluzagnu to Zanšap, there is a sense of anticipation in the air.  Perhaps it is the armies that march through the cities, always heading southwards towards the Salahad. Perhaps it is the flurry of activity and messengers around the headquarters of the Order of the Zenith, though the Elatšari deny it is any more than usual. Perhaps it is the rumors and gossip that slowly drip from the Stone Palace to the lowest parts of Ekluzagnu telling tales of a great liberation, a blow in Surael’s name from which the forces of the Malevolent Dark will never recover. Whatever the cause, the whole of Šad Sur knows something is coming. They are right.\n\nNow, the time has come to announce what all these years of preparations have led up to. Already the Elatšari have stoked the flames of rebellion among the Irsmahapan. On our signal, they are prepared to rise up against their gnollish oppressors, taking up Surael’s torch alongside us in exchange for promises of freedom. It is time to proclaim a War against Darkness—a great crusade against all gnolls in the Salahad! No longer will Bulwar live in fear of the great scourge to the south! Surael’s faithful will spread His light to the whole of the desert, and all that lies beyond! For it is only when every last servant of darkness lies dead, when the lands they have pillaged and burned flourish as Šad Sur now does, when all those they have enslaved can once more revel in Surael’s light, breathing in the fresh air of freedom—it is only then we can finally have peace."

 flavor_zansap.7.d: "It seems the promises the Order of the Zenith made to the Irsmahapan to secure their support have been somewhat misinterpreted. The Elatšari told them that they would have freedom if they fought by our sides, and that was no lie. We have given them their freedom—no longer are they slaves to the vile gnolls, and they are free to devote themselves to Surael under our benevolent protection. However, it seems the greed and foolishness of the gnolls must have rubbed off on them after so many years of servitude, as they thought ‘freedom’ meant ‘self-rule’ and ‘the ability to worship false gods.’ Now, after all we have given them, they are accusing us of betraying our word. Do they not see that their ‘gods’ betrayed them, leaving them to fall under gnollish servitude? Do they not know that without our protection, they would be defenseless against the followers of the Malevolent Dark?\n\nThis disagreement seems to be reaching a boiling point in our newly-liberated land, and it now demands our immediate attention. We are under no obligation to acquiesce to their demands; in freeing them from the gnolls and showing them the light of Surael, we have done all the Elatšari promised and more. However, some of their leaders have offered a compromise. The Irsmahapan will pledge themselves to Surael and accept our suzerainty, but we must agree to let them organize themselves as an autonomous march rather than our direct subjects. If we refuse, there will be little they can do about it, but even with Surael on our side it will be much harder to exert our control over their lands. This may be the last chance we have to ensure their loyalty and prevent open rebellion from breaking out."

 flavor_zansap.9.d: "As night began to fall, our expedition chose to take refuge in a nearby mountain pass until the morning. It appears they had not been the first to make that decision. It had been the site of a large battle; the valley was strewn with an innumerable amount of skeletal corpses, human and gnollish alike. When an explorer noticed the glint of the evening sun reflecting off a bejeweled crown in the distance, everything became clear. Buried beneath a pile of gnollish bones lay the last remains of Bavar the Third, his sword still in hand, adorned in the gleaming battle-armor of an Akal.\n\nWhen the expedition returned with news of what they had found, wagons were immediately sent to recover the bodies of Bavar and his brave soldiers. They have been given proper burials, and the remains of Bavar the Third now lie alongside his family in the Mausoleum of Akals. We had always wondered how that doomed retinue had met their fate, if they had fought to the end bravely or been slaughtered while they slept. Now, we know for sure. Though they may have been overcome in the end, it seems every Šadnatu made sure to take with them as many servants of the Malevolent Dark as they could. Truly, they fought with the strength of Surael Himself."

 flavor_zansap.10.d: "At first, it looked to be any other pile of eroded rocks. However, the keen eye of one of our explorers spotted what looked like rotting wood and tattered cloth buried beneath. Though it took hours to clear away the rubble, what we found was easily worth the effort. It was an old carriage, caught in a rockslide many centuries ago, somewhat shielded from the elements by a small hollow beneath a tomb of stone. Buried beneath a pile of deprecated cloth our expedition found a small safe, hermetically sealed through magical means. When it was brought back to Ekluzagnu and cracked open after considerable effort, we could not believe our luck.\n\nIt contained countless, near perfectly-preserved documents dating back to the invasion of Šad Sur by Jix the Goldseeker over five hundred years ago. Though the dialect was old, our academics managed to easily translate them. These were vital records and intelligence held by the old Akalate, sent on an ill-fated incognito journey to the city of Zanšap following the first fall of Ekluzagnu so they would not fall into gnollish hands. If the information they provided about the historical governance of the first Akalate was not enough, one record also detailed the location of an ancient vault hidden far in the depths of the Stone Palace. Inside, we found the untouched personal collection of Bavar the First himself, who seemed to have been an avid enjoyer of art and culture. Its long-lost paintings and sculptures now line the halls of the palace for all to see."

 flavor_zansap.11.d: "Though Zanšap has been a seat of government for the Šadnatu for nearly as long as the Stone City has, it seems the Palace of Flowers still holds many secrets. Inspired by the discovery of Bavar the First’s hidden collection back in Ekluzagnu, explorers have begun to scour the palace’s basements and cellars for any long forgotten treasures. It seems Surael has smiled upon our endeavors, for we have made a discovery that puts all others to shame: a hidden trapdoor beneath a dusty carpet revealed the entrance to the personal armory of Akal Barseen, unifier of the first Šadnatu Akalate.\n\nThe explorers could hardly believe what lay in front of them. The mythical weapons used by Barseen and his generals, nearly a millennia old, sat gathering dust on ancient racks. Though most had long since been rendered unusable by rust and decay, one still shimmered brightly in its resting place. Triumph—Barseen’s legendary spear, crafted from a sharpened scale torn from the bronze dragon Aakhet himself, said to be eternally blessed by Surael’s light. Even after all these years, not a single sign of degradation was visible upon it. Lost for almost a thousand years, Triumph has now returned to its rightful place at the side of our Akal. As long as it remains within our hands, all will know we are the true successors to Barseen. Never again will the glorious history of the Šadnatu be forgotten! Never again shall we know defeat!"

Surael’s light is unable to penetrate beneath the meters upon meters of dirt, sand, and stone. However, we, His servants, are able to go where He cannot.\n\n"Fascinating… These steles have been almost perfectly preserved, despite thousands of years…" an academic murmurs, his faint lamplight illuminating an illustration of Surael’s garden, the indigo-orpiment mixture creating a verdant and bountiful landscape upon the barren stone.\n\nAn Elatšari standing guard next to him grips an icon of Surael hanging from his neck at his chest. "Along with your ‘history’, heresy is preserved all the same…" He sneers, seeing depictions of God-kings, djinn, and other images of blasphemous works.\n\n The expedition leader, an elderly captain from Surib, cuts the conversation short. "Enough fighting, the both of you." He raises his lamp, light cascading against the ancient stonework, showing a great entranceway along with yet another set of stairs descending into the depths. The captain grimly continues, "Surael has more work for us yet.""

 flavor_zansap.13.d: "By Surael! What is that?’ cries the young academic. ‘Some sort of magical vault door? I’ve never seen anything quite like it!’\n\n The expedition’s lamps are unnecessary in this grand hallway, as the turquoise glow emanating from the circular door in front of them is enough to illuminate the whole area. Strange runes stretch across the surface of the structure, gently pulsating almost as if they were alive. At the exact center of the door lies a large, metal wheel, seemingly meant to be a handle.\n\n‘Out of the way! In Surael’s name, whatever lies behind that door is the rightful property of His faithful!’ The Elatšari guard roughly shoves the academic aside, causing his bag to tumble to the floor. The clanging of the equipment inside echoes throughout the curved stone arches of the room. One hand clasped around his pendant, the Elatšar fearlessly marches to the end of the corridor and starts to reach up to the handle\n\n‘Stop! Are you mad?’ shouts the expedition’s captain, the sternness of his voice belying the sudden rush of fear he felt. The Elatšar freezes in place with his hand an inch away from the metal, recognizing the seriousness of the situation. Slowly, he brings his arm down and takes a step backward. The captain breathes a sigh of relief. ‘Don’t be foolish. We don’t know what kind of magic is on that thing. We’ll head back up to the surface and get some proper specialists to take a crack at it.’\n\nThe Elatšar grumbles, seeming to begrudgingly accept this compromise. The academic, having recovered his bag, shoots an angry glare at his assaulter before walking up to the captain. ‘Sir, it’s the general opinion of the academic community nowadays that we should keep old vaults sealed. It’s probably locked up for a reason. You know about Amussu, right?’\n\nThe captain sighs. ‘Kid, this isn’t gonna be Amussu. We’ve been sent down here for a reason, and that reason is to find something worth finding. You don’t make a magical vault like this unless you’re gonna put something worth finding inside it. Plus, as long as we have Surael on our side, we’ve got nothing to worry about, yeah?’ He clears his throat, projecting his voice loud enough for the whole of the expedition to hear. ‘Alright boys, time to head back!"

No amount of magic or well-thought out engineering can stand up to a few barrels of heavy explosives, though considering the dwarves’ track record with this kind of thing, we should probably keep a close eye on the rest of Ekluzagnu for a while.\n\nThe young academic stands at the entrance to the vault expectantly, waiting for the dust to clear. ‘There has to be an old genie relic inside,’ he thinks. ‘I’ve always wanted to see one in person!’ Could it be an ancient weapon? Some strange piece of artwork? Maybe even a magic lamp? The anticipation is killing him.\n\nAs the dust begins to settle, the vault begins to reveal itself. It is completely empty, save for a single pillar in the center. The academic excitedly stares at it, making out two words carved into its rock—not in an ancient script, but in modern Bulwari. It reads\n\n‘SORRY. PLACEHOLDER.’\n\n‘Damn it.’ says the academic."

Yet here in the Far East of the Salahad, we find ourselves at a peculiar crossroads. We are faced with not a gnollish pack, nor a heretic legion. We see before us a fellow human kingdom, resolute in their worship of Surael, though misguided and insulated from the true faith. We must take them under our wing and teach them, as Surael teaches us, and defend them from the perfidious Gnolls and mercantile kingdoms of the East, as Surael defends us.

However, they have done so through their bloody bargain with "the Order of the Zenith," slaughtering human, elf, and gnoll alike for supposed heresy. However, we have been given a puzzling offer: protection. While we are wary of outsiders, especially of the zealous and self-righteous variety, we cannot deny that we have been laid low by invasion after invasion and that a protective wing covering us may allow us to recover."

 flavor_zansap.17.t: "Humour Them"
 flavor_zansap.17.d: "What began as a simple curiosity has turned into a fiery debate that threatens to tear our Akalate apart at the very seams. The gnolls of Haraagtseda seem to be genuinely willing to embrace Surael’s light, and they have won over the hearts of many Šadnatu in their quest for recognition. The Order of the Zenith, meanwhile, retains their stance that all gnolls are inherently evil and should be indiscriminately cleansed from Surael’s Garden. Gnoll-friendly priests—many of whom hold great sway over our government—lift the Haraagtsedi up as examples of true devotion, a people who have overcome their monstrous nature through the mercy of Surael in order to serve Him. But there are still many who still feel the wounds the slaves of the Malevolent Dark once inflicted upon us, and they are not willing to trust a gnoll so easily. Across Šad Sur, people take to the streets and demand an immediate answer to this ‘gnollish question.’\n\nIn fact, we already have an answer of sorts. The Order has brought the issue up in front of the Duzešru, the religious court of Šad Sur. After weeks of debate, the Duzešru decided by a margin of only a single vote that Surael is willing to accept any convert, gnoll or otherwise. The Order is, of course, refusing to accept this verdict. They now argue that allowing a monstrous populace to reside within our borders is a matter of civil security, not a religious issue. As such, they now demand the case be retried in front of the Bittešru, the civil court, where they would almost certainly win due to the influence the Order holds over civil affairs. We could easily put a stop to this ploy, but the Elatšari have privately mentioned to the Akal that the gnolls’ expulsion would allow us to justifiably plunder the city of Haraagtseda—something that could prove a significant boon to our treasury. There is also the concern of keeping the Elatšari themselves happy; no doubt they would take our intervention in this matter as a serious insult. But is it truly Surael’s will to turn our back on those who would pledge themselves to Him?"

 flavor_zansap.18.d: "Dasmatuš has been a part of Šad Sur for many years now, but one point of tension still remains. The Old Sun Cult still holds considerable sway over the city, with its priests holding countless local administrative positions. As they are still technically devotees of Surael, our policy on this has remained lenient—we know they will inevitably accept the true Chosen given time, for it is His truth. However, the Order of the Zenith has vehemently denounced the continued presence of heretics within our Akalate. ‘If we were willing to burn the False Prophet all those years ago’, they say, ‘why have we not given these apostates the same treatment?’ They simply do not understand the nuance of the situation. We will not burn a city that has shown us nothing but loyalty, no matter how heretical their beliefs.\n\nIt started quite small. Elatšari present in Dasmatuš would get into heated arguments with the local clergy, some of which would turn violent or even deadly. The Order demanded an increased presence in the city, claiming a need to maintain stability and prevent further deaths. We agreed, as there was no reason to get on the Order’s bad side over an issue such as this. Then, powerful Old Sun Cult priests began to turn up murdered on the streets, their throats cut in the dark of night. The Order blamed this on local extremists trying to incite violence—another excuse to send more Elatšari. Soon enough, their presence in the city far outstripped that of the local militia. You could not turn a corner without seeing a pair of Order peacekeepers patrolling the streets.\n\nIn hindsight, we should have seen this coming.\n\nThis morning, without our knowledge or prior approval, armed Elatšari forcibly rounded up every single priest in the city with known ties to the Old Sun Cult. Even those that had long since embraced the true path of Surael were not spared, accused of being false converts. They were tied up, paraded to the city center, proclaimed guilty of heresy… and burned alive at the stake. The Elatšari then marched through the city, burning down every last temple that they judged heretical and slaughtering any who tried to resist. It was little more than a bloodbath. If the mayor himself—luckily a close friend of the Akal—had not threatened the Order with a charge of outright treason, we do not know how much further they would have gone. Though the fires are out, Dasmatuš lies burnt and broken, a shadow of its former self. The Order has far overstepped their bounds, and they know it.\n\nThe Akal has demanded the heads of all who were involved in plotting this conspiracy and given a personal apology to the people of Dasmatuš, but it is unlikely much more will be done. Neither we nor the Order want things to escalate further, so it is best to simply brush this matter under the rug. What is done is done, and the past cannot be changed. Regardless, the presence of the Old Sun Cult in the city has been all but eliminated, with any survivors hastily converting or fleeing north to Bulwar. If there is one silver lining to this situation, it is that we are unlikely to see any further religious tension here."

Countless caravans of workers and materials have departed Ekluzagnu already, with many more to follow.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before the Bronze Road reaches completion. Soon the Salahad will be easily navigable for the first time since Jaher, but we will go to a place not even the Conqueror managed to reach.

Vast, fertile plains once devastated by the gnollish scourge now lay empty, ready to be claimed by Šadnatu pioneers. People from across the mountains have left their old lives behind and joined up with caravans crossing the Salahad. The Bronze Road has been pushed to capacity, flooded with a tide of carriages heading southwards. Aelantir is all but forgotten—why sail the seas to find a new world when there is one at our very doorstep?\n\nAlready frontier towns have sprung up in the new lands, built off the ruined gnollish settlements. The rapid population growth has quickly exceeded the present infrastructural capacity, leaving disease and starvation commonplace. Luckily, the existence of the Bronze Road allows us to easily send additional supplies south, so these problems are already beginning to fade.

The elf-kings in the north claim to be the heirs to Jaher and Jexis, but while we fought off the forces of darkness, they did nothing but fight amongst themselves! In their petty politics, their squabbles for power, they have forgotten their duty to Surael as his Chosen! How Taelarios would weep if he saw what his kin have become! If we wish to see true peace in His garden, then our path is clear. From this day forth Bulwar shall be united, but not under a Phoenix Emperor.
