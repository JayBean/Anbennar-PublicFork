 anb_price.8.d:0 "A new technique for fabric production have begun to emerge among the clothworkers of [Root.GetName]. The so called 'New Draperies' are much thinner, lighter and cheaper than the thick woolens that used to be in demand. While demand is on the rise for these new products their productions makes use of considerably less wool and as a result prices have been declining."

 anb_price.9.d:0 "The enlistment armies of old are increasingly being replaced by more permanent national armies.

 anb_price.10.t:0 "Depletion of the Cannorian Beaver"
 anb_price.10.d:0 "The demand for furs has been constantly rising throughout the middle ages and an increasingly colder climate has not done anything to change this lately. Because of this the Cannorian beaver population is having trouble coping with the constantly growing demand for furs. It has gotten to the point that beavers are very rarely seen in Cannorian at all and furs now have to be imported at great cost from Gawed and the far north."

 anb_price.13.t:0 "Bronze Cannons"
 anb_price.13.d:0 "The bronze cannon has made its entrance on the battlefield and is here to stay. The materials needed to feed the growing cannon-making industries have led to an explosion in the demand for copper over the last few years and prices have risen as a result."
 anb_price.13.a:0 "Ok."
 
 anb_price.14.t:0 "Changing Patterns of Consumption"
 anb_price.14.d:0 "Sugar was once a rare luxury that had to be imported from the Northern Salahad or Bulwar. As the world has opened up and the purchasing power of our urban class has increased, sugar may still be considered a luxury, but quite an affordable one."

 anb_price.15.t:0 "Popularization of Silk Fabrics"
 anb_price.15.d:0 "Silk has been in high demand throughout the world since long before the middle ages and its procurement was one of the driving forces behind the mercantiles ventures to the east. With the greater availability of silk, both raw and woven, the demand for Silk cloth in Cannor is soaring ever higher."
 anb_price.15.a:0 "Ok."
 
 anb_price.16.t:0 "Development of Veneering"
 anb_price.16.d:0 "Initially many types of tropical wood would be considered too brittle by woodworkers. With the development of veneering, however, it has become possible to make use of Ebony and other tropical woods selected for their beauty rather than their strength. As a result the creation of beautiful and original cabinets and other prestige furniture from tropical woods has grown into a major business, with [Root.GetName] being the major exporter of such goods."
 anb_price.16.a:0 "Ok."
 
 anb_price.17.t:0 "Development of Ironworking"
 anb_price.17.d:0 "Various advances in the field of ironworking have meant that the iron cannon is now both more efficient and reliable than the old bronze cannons.

 anb_price.17.a:0 "Ok."
 
 anb_price.18.t:0 "Hot Chocolate"
 anb_price.18.d:0 "The use of Cocoa to create a hot beverage is a custom inherited from the Precursor Elves. While the new drink caught on quickly in some parts of Cannorian society it has taken some time, and large amounts of sugar, before it reached a larger acceptance. With that out of the way, however, the demand for chocolate is now steadily increasing in the old world."
 anb_price.18.a:0 "Ok."
 
 anb_price.19.t:0 "Growing Popularity of Tobacco"
 anb_price.19.a:0 "Ok."
 anb_price.19.d:0 "Originally marketed as a medicinal plant Tobacco has come to be increasingly popular in both the Cannorian and Bulwari world for its recreational purposes. From Anbenncóst to Bulwar the habit has grown to such an extent that the tobacco business is becoming quite lucrative."
 
 anb_price.20.t:0 "The International Bookmarket"
 anb_price.20.d:0 "While paper is superior to parchment in many ways, it has never entirely been able to displace it. However, with the popularization of the Printing Press, books, pamphlets and even playing cards have become commonplace, in a way they never have before. The art of producing paper itself has also become far more refined over the last decades and these two things now coincide to make paper much more sought after than ever before.\n\nPerhaps the most visible example of this is the bookmarket of [bookmarket_here.GetCapitalName], which seems to grow larger every year. Originally a fair for the printers of [bookmarket_here.GetAreaName], the fair now sees visitors from the entire continent."
 anb_price.20.a:0 "[bookmarket_here.GetCapitalName] truly is the greatest bookmarket in the world."
 anb_price.20.b:0 "This will benefit the entire province."
 
 anb_price.21.t:0 "The Beater"
 anb_price.21.d:0 "For centuries paper mills have relied on mechanical hammers to beat lumpen paper pulp, crushing the fiber to create the raw material needed to then create paper.\n\nUsing the local windmills for power, enterprising artisans in [hollender_beater_province.GetName] have now devised a more efficient solution. What they call the [Root.GetAdjective] Beater, is a vat with a wind-powered horizontal roller with blades. These blades can shred as much pulp in hours as the old hammers did in days."
 anb_price.21.a:0 "The Paper Market will never be the same."
 
 anb_price.22.t:0 "Administrating An Empire"
 anb_price.22.d:0 "Bureaucrats have long favored paper over parchment and other materials due to how much easier it is to work with. There are also various measures that can be taken to make official papers harder to falsify. The invention of the watermark in Seinathíl is one, the elaborate marbling techniques and calligraphy of the Raheni ministers another.\n\nAs Empires increasingly come to grow to encompass more than one continent this need for provable authenticity and ease of use has lead to Imperial Bureaucracies from Yanshen to Cannor exclusively using paper for official documents and orders."
 anb_price.22.a:0 "Paper is the future."
 
 anb_price.23.t:0 "Lending Libraries and Book Clubs"
 anb_price.23.d:0 "With literacy on the rise, the spread and dissemination of books has become an objective both for economical and, ideological reasons. Booksellers have become a much more common sight in many cities in general, and in large ones such as [lending_libraries_here.GetName] there are entire shop streets lined with boxes of books for sale.\n\nFor those that could not afford to buy books themselves there are now an increasing number of ways to lend or co-finance book purchases, such as paid lending-libraries, book buying cooperatives, or subscription societies."
 anb_price.23.a:0 "Can the masses really be trusted with the written word?"
 
 anb_price.24.t:0 "Faceting"
 anb_price.24.d:0 "Gem-cutting masters in [diamond_city.GetCapitalName] have made a breakthrough in diamond cutting by experimenting with diamond dust suspended in oil on their scaifs. This is allowing the [Root.GetAdjective] artisans to cut the rare stones in entirely new shapes and to much greater brilliance. The resulting technique, known as faceting, produces a stone of a more pleasing geometric shape and with better optical qualities. As the new stones, and the technique for making them, spread across courts and workshops the demand for jewelry, diamonds and precious stones is increasing greatly."
 anb_price.24.a:0 "Gems are truly outrageous."
 
 anb_price.25.t:0 "Serpentspine Diamonds"
 anb_price.25.d:0 "Diamonds, a type of stone so durable that it cannot even be polished, save from using its own dust, has long been the most rare of all precious stones. For centuries, some Cannorian mines have been the only known source of Diamonds in the entire world, and even there it is only found in a few well guarded mining regions.\n\nWith the discovery of large quantities of diamonds in the Serpentspine, however, diamonds have become something not only for kings and princes, but also for rich magnates, burghers or other connoisseurs of jewelry."
 anb_price.25.a:0 "Diamonds are forever."
 SERPENTSPINE_DIAMONDS:0 "Serpentspine Diamonds"
 
 anb_price.26.t:0 "Growth of the Perfume Industry"
 anb_price.26.d:0 "A growing merchant class as well as increasingly demanding social code among the nobility and upper classes has lead to an increased demand for perfume. The halls of grand palaces are now expected to have a likable scent as well as a majestic decor. This has lead to a surge in demand for products such as frankincense, myrrh and other scented products for the making of perfume and in [perfume_city_grass.GetCapitalName], the refinement of local flowers and foreign scented goods have even grown into a major industry in itself."
 anb_price.26.a:0 "They certainly have a good nose for things like this."
 
 anb_price.27.t:0 "Selective Breeding"
 anb_price.27.d:0 "Through the scientific and very aggressive breeding of horses, pigs, cows and sheep, [Root.GetAdjective] farmers have begun to create entirely new types of animals, more specialized for the various tasks they are to perform. For centuries various regions have had famous breeds of livestock but with the new methods now being pioneered it has become evident how easy it is for man to create specific improvements in the animals.\n\nAs a result the cattle trade is being revitalized, with a drastic increase in the quality of sold animals rather than just the quantity of animals sold."
 anb_price.27.a:0 "Remarkable."
 
 anb_price.28.t:0 "Improvements in Lens Making"
 anb_price.28.d:0 "Ever since the 13th century spectacles made from glass lenses have come to replace the reading stones of older eras. Through thorough optical observation these lenses have now reached a level of perfection that has allowed even the smallest of things to be enlarged.\n\nTo the delight of scholars these new lenses can also be used to create both optical microscopes, allowing them to examine what could never be seen before, and the refracting telescope, allowing study of far-away objects such as the stars. The field of optics is now at the brink of a revolution, bringing great benefits both to science, navigation and warfare."
 anb_price.28.a:0 "We can now see things far away as if they were nearby."
 
 anb_price.29.t:0 "Flint Glass & Lead Crystal"
 anb_price.29.d:0 "Glassmakers in [glass_province.GetName] have started using flintstone and sand together with lead to create a clear, easily worked and flawless product. This new method is rapidly challenging the existing major glass producing centers in the world as the markets are flooded in the new, and very popular product."
 anb_price.29.a:0 "Brilliant."
 
 anb_price.30.t:0 "Improvements in Coal Mining"
 anb_price.30.d:0 "Over time, technology has greatly increased the output of existing coal mines as well as making it possible to mine coal in many places where it would previously have been unfeasible. Our coal mines are working at an unprecedented efficiency and while the continued industrialization still means that coal is in great demand this demand can now more easily be met."
 anb_price.30.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 anb_price.31.t:0 "Coffee for the Mages"
 anb_price.31.d:0 "It has recently been discovered that coffee drastically increases the concentration of any magic student. The increased availability of coffee through the many Aelantir plantations has made it possible to meet the growing demand for this black beverage."

 MAGIC_BEVERAGE:0 "Magic Beverage"
 
 anb_price.32.t:0 "Poison for the Mind"

 anb_price.33.t:0 "Cotton Imports"

 anb_price.33.b:0 "Mercantilism is the right way."
 
 anb_price.34.t:0 "Cork Bottle Stoppers"
 anb_price.34.d:0 "Developments in bottle making have allowed Wine producers to create bottles in more standardized sizes and as a result have been able to reintroduce the use of the bottle cork. This is a much more efficient way to seal in the wine than the old cloth stoppers and has meant that wine can now be transported over much farther distances than was previously considered possible. Perhaps we are now seeing the birth of a worldwide wine trade."

In recent years, however, following the aftermath of the Greentide, the Serpentspine has slowly been resettled by the dwarven peoples. As a result, the ancient forges of the dwarven holds churn to life once more, and vast quantities of metal have begun flowing out of the mountains, and into the eager arms of the surface world."

Since days long before the Day of Ashen Skies, Halessi Silk has been produced through a painstaking process, requiring great effort to create relatively little of the much sought-after fabric. In recent years, however, new innovations have been made, allowing silk to not only be produced much more cheaply, but at a much larger scale.

The new adventurer kingdoms of Escann, settled in the aftermath of the Greentide, seem to be loving it far more than anyone else, as is the way with the newly rich.

It seems that porcelain, moreso than any other material, is strangely resistant to magic. In fact, unlike black damestear, it has been found to simply contain magic, rather than nullifying it. As such, demand for porcelain has gone through the roof, as various mages, wizards, and sorcerers all scramble to get their hands on as much porcelain as possible for their magical experimentation."

This has led many on the seemingly futile quest to recreate it on Cannorian soil, but with none successful. Until now, that is. An Escanni Artificer has been able to successfully recreate the valued substance using relatively basic materials. Their method has rapidly spread throughout Escann, and it seems that each day a new porcelain workshop opens its doors in the east."

However, with the gradual resettlement of the Dwarovar, more and more mithril mines have been found, and the price of mithril has slowly but surely decreased. Although still one of the most valuable metals in the world, it is no longer as rare as it once was, and mithril is now available to the average adventurer, though still at an incredibly steep price."

Still, whenever cloves are mentioned it is rare to not hear mention of the great port of Teramzandai in the same sentence. This port, in the south of Fahvanosy, has become a staple port of the entire clove trade, Cannorians, Vyzemby, and lizardfolk alike are heard haggling about the docks. It is no surprise then that with the influx of merchants getting their hands on these exotic goods, the price too has risen! "
