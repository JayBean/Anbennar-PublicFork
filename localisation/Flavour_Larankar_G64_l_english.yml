 G64_1_1_revenge_and_restitution_title: "Revange and Restitution"
 G64_1_1_revenge_and_restitution_desc: "The King of the Desert – home of rogues, charlatans, and above all, the last Enlarmadar. After Nanru Nakar, Sheranu and her husband-king had invaded Larankar, tried to seize Erankar’s birthright once more. Erankar won, drove them back to their den like the scurrying kotakompu they were – but the deed is not yet done, and it will not be until every last Enlarmadar is buried beneath the sand."

 G64_1_2_master_of_iron_and_sand_title: "Master of Iron and Sand"
 G64_1_2_master_of_iron_and_sand_desc: "From the mines of the Iron Hills and the sands of the Sarihaddu, the last two great empires of Taychend were born. The First and Second Gophiran Empires united Taychend, returned it to the glory of its classical era – but they could not withstand the test of time, and the ambitions of elves. If Larankar is to surpass them, then it must first master their old homelands."

 G64_1_3_see_to_the_steppe_title: "See to the Steppe"
 G64_1_3_see_to_the_steppe_desc: "The Guaraddhi, the borderlands that mark the rugged Chendhyan steppe’s eastern frontier, have long been a thorn in our side, its raiders sallying out to wreak havoc on Taychend. The recent rise of Zaernmaera, and the destruction of the slaver-city of Kannagarendi, have only exacerbated matters. If we are to forge a lasting empire, we must see to the steppe, and appoint a new guardian of the frontier."

 G64_2_2_bound_by_fear_title: "Bound By Fear"
 G64_2_2_bound_by_fear_desc: "Erankar knows what it is like to face revolt and rebellion, the very things that have broken many Taychendi empires before him. With his treasonous vassals and subject-warlords broken beneath his heel, he also knows how to best deal with them: fear. Fear of himself, of course, a fear that only grows with his glory, and fear of the enemy – the invader. The Conqueror. Perhaps it is time to remind the vassals of their situation?"

 G64_2_3_destiny_denied_title: "Destiny Denied"
 G64_2_3_destiny_denied_desc: "Laskaris the Conqueror. They called him Erankar’s equal – the other invader, the other conqueror, the other “hero”. Ameion’s phalanx marches behind Laskaris’ fate-threaded shield – a destiny that says Ameion, propelled by the will of the conqueror, will crush all who defy them.\n\nBut we will not be a slave to Laskaris nor destiny! Tens of thousands of spears lie ready to march on the invaders – it is time to see if the power of prophecy can beat the power of steel."
 
 G64_2_4_warlord_autonomous_title: "Warlord Autonomous"
 G64_2_4_warlord_autonomous_desc: "The Emperor-Defiant, the Warlord-Autonomous. Without peer, without equal, master of Taychend. Against the whims of destiny, against the tides of history, Larankar has fought and struggled – and now, it has emerged triumphant. The dawn of the final empire, the Larankarha Empire, has come."
 
 G64_2_5_settle_the_succession_title: "Settle the Succession"
 G64_2_5_settle_the_succession_desc: "Now that Taychend is secure, the Emperor can see to other matters – namely, the strife that has riven the royal family in recent years. A contested succession can spell disaster, and if we do not carefully prepare, all that we have gained may come crashing down yet."
 
 G64_3_1_unfinished_business_title: "Unfinished Business"
 G64_3_1_unfinished_business_desc: "In 1437, Erankar marched on Nanru Nakar – in the ensuing battle outside the walls, he slew King Pelozhil in single combat. He thought he’d turned the tide of a losing battle – but the current was too strong. In the following years, Erankar nearly lost his entire kingdom, as Larankar exploded into rebellion.\n\nBut while Erankar defied fate’s design, and rebuilt his shattered realm, Nanru Nakar splintered further. With Larankar united and the great city divided, the time to act is surely now – though there is no telling how the Three Brothers will react when the North marches against them once more…"
 
 G64_3_2_scholars_rats_and_traitors_title: "Scholars, Rats, and Traitors"
 G64_3_2_scholars_rats_and_traitors_desc: "With Nanru Nakar subjugated, it is time to finish the conquest of the Kalavend. The cities of the lower river are rich and strong, however, and it will surely be difficult to rule over them by ourselves.\n\nLuckily for us, there are many potential future allies in the region – the wild kotakompu-kings of Uesrennu, the wealthy merchants of Orenkoraim, the scholars of Katelperai, and, should we get them on side, even the Four Families of Royakottar. If we are to cement our rule over our new territories, one of these groups must become our agent."
 
 G64_3_3_paving_the_north_arc_title: "Paving the North Arc"
 G64_3_3_paving_the_north_arc_desc: "The New Loop, the grand trading route that circles Taychend, has been a vital golden artery of trade for centuries. Since its founding, however, it has been split into two. The North Arc, which we now control, runs through Larankar and the Kalavend, from Clemetar to Orenkoraim.\n\nDeveloping this key trade route by paving the roads and constructing caravansaries is key if we wish to become an Empire of Opulence – not to mention the military applications of such a project."
 
 G64_3_4_all_roads_lead_to_urvand_title: "All Roads Lead to Urvand"
 G64_3_4_all_roads_lead_to_urvand_desc: "With all of Taychend under our control, our grand project to breathe new life into the New Loop, Taychend’s vital trade artery, nears completion. First, we must pave the South Arc, from Sibisimra to Nagar Vyechei and from Korrimadhala to Oremvand. Then, we must ensure that the core of our empire, Taychend, and soon all Andeios – Urvand, the city of opulence – becomes the Gilded-Heart of trade we desire it to be. Soon, all roads shall lead to Urvand."
 
 G64_4_1_a_penny_for_the_cults_title: "A Penny for the Cults"
 G64_4_1_a_penny_for_the_cults_desc: "His entire life Erankar has defied fate. Why, then, should he listen to the cults and priests who espouse its power? The King of Larankar has learned time and time again that orthodoxy is stagnation and that honour in battle is a myth, that cunning and determination is the surest path to glory.\n\nFor these beliefs, some call him a heretic, while others even suggest that Laskaris is a better “hero-king” than he is – maybe they’re right, but a politically inconvenient truth is one that must be silenced. Perhaps it is time to throw a penny to the cults, and secure their loyalty once and for all?"
 
 G64_4_2_guilding_the_endioka_title: "Gilding the Endioka"
 G64_4_2_guilding_the_endioka_desc: "The cities of the Endioka river were once great, growing rich in the peaceful Larankarha Kingdoms of ages past. But as Larankar began to take on the southern ideas of glory and ambition, the cities fractured, their strength sapped by the horseriders of the countryside.\n\nAt last, only Enlarmai, Urvand and Clemetar remained as the great cities of Larankar. But with more riches flowing into Larankar than ever before, the chance to rebuild the ruined cities – to gild the Endioka – has arisen. The river’s glory will be rebuild once more."
 
 G64_4_3_bound_by_greed_title: "Bound By Greed"
 G64_4_3_bound_by_greed_desc: "Ambition, vainglory, greed. The trifecta of motivators driving the strife of civil war and rebellion. Ambition and vainglory are difficult to appease, but greed? One thing Erankar learnt is that complacency can be bought, even if loyalty cannot – and Urvand is rich indeed. Let us bring the riches of the south back to our Larankarha subjects, and enrich the vassals who rule over the rest of our empire – with the warlords bound by greed, Larankar will endure."
 
 G64_4_5_amarayana_gurhavyar_title: "Amarayana Gurhavyar"
 G64_4_5_amarayana_gurhavyar_desc: "Amarayana Gurhavyar – the Empire of Horsemen. When Larankar had been united before, some kings had dreamed of greater conquests, like Teshalazhil the Red-Eyed or Seronraha the Marauder. They all failed, their realms collapsing to treachery or entropy – but not this time. Rather than simply raiding the lands surrounding Larankar, our riders keep the peace over an empire stretching from Oremvand to Vettakaramai – and soon, they will march beyond our borders once more, and conquer the very world!"
 
 G64_5_1_city_of_opulance_title: "City of Opulance"
 G64_5_1_city_of_opulance_desc: "The gold mines of Urvand are deep, winding, unending. Slaves have toiled in their oppressive heat for a millennium and more, and still they have not nearly been exhausted. It has been this gold that has fueled Urvand’s relevance over the years, shielding it even when the other cities of Larankar faltered – it will be this gold that fuels Larankar’s burgeoning empire.\n\nBut Urvand must take on a different role in Larankar to its current economic one – it must become a symbol, a city of power and wealth and opulence, dazzling our subjects. With the Endioka and the highlands under our control, and our riches on full display, who would want to turn against us, when the promise of greatness is before their eyes?"
 
 G64_5_2_expand_the_herds_title: "Expand the Herds"
 G64_5_2_expand_the_herds_desc: "The Yodhanpir have their champions, the Kalavendhi their urban levies, the Thekvrystana their mercenaries and mages, and the Sarihaddu their horse archers. Our cavalry can best either foe on an open field! Larankarha riders, armed with spear and javelin and armoured in scale and mail, have shown their devastating efficiency over the years, equally able to both skirmish and charge, shattering the enemy’s withered lines. We must first cultivate this power – by expanding our horse herds, we can create an army that will win us an empire."
 
 G64_5_3_the_trick_and_the_spear_title: "The Trick and the Spear"
 G64_5_3_the_trick_and_the_spear_desc: "To Erankar, cunning triumphs over honour every time. His generalship has always favoured the clever tactic over the frontal assault, sophisticated manoeuvre over a forwards march. But he faces an equally innovative foe in the form of Laskaris, perhaps the greatest Kheionai military genius since Gelmonias the Brave himself – and so he must adapt further. By investigating the ideas of the Chendhyans and Sarihaddi, he will hone his own forces, and by the trick and the spear, he will overcome all odds."
 
 G64_5_4_bodyguards_of_an_empire_title: "Bodyguards of an Empire"
 G64_5_4_bodyguards_of_an_empire_desc: "As Larankar expands, the difficulty of maintaining control – both politically and militarily – expand alongside it. The sheer size of the empire has made policing local revolts and disturbances difficult, and keeping track of which parts of Larankar’s vast army are loyal is growing trickier by the year. Creating a specialised force of cavalry, picked from the Emperor’s own household, that can respond to any threat at any time will be vital to Larankar’s survival. Soon, all will grow to fear the sight of their gilded breastplates and shining lances."
 
 #Events
 larankar_events.0.t: "I, Erankar"
 larankar_events.0.d: "Erankar had spent his life defying the odds. A second son, brought into the world by the blade, cut free from his dying mother, nearly taken by fever soon after. When Enlarmai slew his father, sacked his city and slaughtered his family, his desperate and miraculous escape should have rendered him a simply disappeared child rather than a dead one. A decade later, he returned to Urvand in triumph, the leader of an accomplished mercenary company. Enlarmai fell soon after.\n\nThough he executed it’s rulers, he had spared the city itself, his ambition reaching beyond a mere regional rival. With thirty thousand elves at his back, he marched on Nanru Nakar. Even as his army collapsed around him, he had surged forwards, slew King Pelozhil – but it was not enough. History told him that should have been the end – but Erankar learned long ago that nothing is pre-ordained. His own strength of will had won him his army, his kingdom, his vengeance. When Larankar exploded into civil war, and Enlarmai rose up in revolt, it was his will that put it back together.\n\nThis time, he was not so lenient. Erankar could feel the heat even from here, as the funeral pyre of Enlarmai choked the sky with smoke. It should have been cathartic – but this was but a sideshow to the real problem. There was a new invader in the south, whose glory had risen in parallel to Erankar’s own. The bearer of a fate-threaded shield, immortal, unstoppable, destined to conquer the world: Laskaris the Conqueror.\n\nLaskaris might trust in destiny’s delusion, and the pious might cower from a fate-woven farce, but it didn’t matter. No matter what, no matter the cost, Erankar the Defiant would become Emperor of Taychend. The sabre’s edge, after all, may test all threads…"
 larankar_events.0.a: "…and Erankar’s blade shall tear fate’s own asunder!"

 larankar_events.1.t: "Duel of the Two Heroes"
 larankar_events.1.d: "“Erankar!” Laskaris called out, a cocksure grin written across his face, as the warlord surged forwards, greatsabre in hand. “I’d hoped to find you!” Steel clashed. The Taychendi pressed forwards, the Kheionai pushed back. “Your glory nearly surpasses mine,” he taunted, “but you fight against the tide!” The duel, the dance, began. “I have plans, hero-king– a fate to fulfil! I fight for a better world–!” Laskaris parried, lowered his stance, drove his sword forwards. “What do you fight for?”\n\n“A better world?” Erankar blazed white-hot. “Or one where you devour us!” the Taychendi snarled as he batted Laskaris’ thrust away. “You fight for your world, not ours!”\n\n“Your people are greater than you know!” Laskaris’ voice strained as the duel took its toll. “A glory is yours that you ignore! You have beauty! You have passion!” Erankar’s reply came with a savage strike against the Kheionai’s shield. The dance resumed. “In my dreams, I sit outside Nanru Nakar– I watch a Taychend in bloom! The river barges sailing full on the still water, the children at play in the furrowed fields! That is what I fight for! That is what destiny demands! It is my duty, my ambition! So tell me– tell me what you fight for!”\n\nIn an instant, Erankar knew why Laskaris had come so far. He could see the hope, the future. The peace. The Ambhen officer at watch, the Taychendi slaves in restful bliss. The boot on their neck invisible but ever-present. In an instant, Erankar knew what he fought against – and for. “I fight for myself!” A parry, a miss, a shattered shield, a sabre raised with sure hands. “And I fight–” Laskaris looked up, eyes wide. Disbelieving. “–so that the Taychendi can choose their own damn destiny!”\n\nThe blade fell. Steel cut steel. A bloody line appeared across Laskaris’ chest as he staggered back, shock – denial – written across his face. Blood poured freely as he collapsed. The battle came alive again, as his bodyguards rushed in. Erankar cut down elf after elf – but soon enough the Conqueror was out of reach. It didn’t matter."
 larankar_events.1.a: "Laskaris might live, but his dream dies here. His destiny denied – and fate defied!"

 larankar_events.2.t: "The Last Enlarmadar"
 larankar_events.2.d: "Erankar marched through the ruins of Marhed Rayodana’s palace, the centre of power in this den of snakes and armadillo-scaled scoundrels. After he had been thrown back from Nanru Nakar, Sheranu Enlarmadar, who had survived his capture of Enlarmai by virtue of being married to the Rayodani King, had launched an invasion of Larankar from here. He’d have preferred to storm it himself, but he was on the other side of the city when it was taken, drawn to a bigger threat. Luckily, his soldiers had taken his prize alive.\n\nSheranu kneeled next to her husband, bound and guarded. Her husband simply stared forwards, despondent, but when Sheranu noticed Erankar’s approach, she spat on the ground before him. Erankar drew his sword, executed the Rayodani warlord, and pointed the blood-stained tip at the last Enlarmadar.\n\n“Do you expect me to beg?” Her eyes blazed with hatred. “You’ve taken everything from me! My parents, my brother– and defeating me in battle wasn’t enough so you burn my home down too, kill my husband! Will you raze Rayodana now? Bathe the sand in blood?”\n\nErankar could feel the heat rising in him, a white hot rage that threatened to engulf him. “Your family did all that and more! I was only reclaiming what was rightfully mine – vengeance!”\n\n“So was I!” Sheranu spat. “I had nothing to do with my father taking Urvand– YOU had everything to do with slaughtering my family! When Urvand fell, I was only nine years old–!” Erankar’s blade flashed. Sheranu fell to the floor, lifeless.\n“So was I.”\nErankar sheathed his sabre, hand shaking. He looked back at the city behind him."
 larankar_events.2.a: "“Back to camp, and no looting. There’s been enough bloodshed today.”"
 larankar_events.2.b: "“Raze the city – give it back to the desert.”"
 larankar_events.2.c: "“Raze the city – the Sarihaddi can have its ruins.”"

 larankar_events.3.t: "Triumph in Nakar"
 larankar_events.3.d: "Erankar the Defiant, King of Larankar, Lord of Urvand, beamed as he rode down the streets of Nanru Nakar, his army at his back. He could add “Taker of Nanru Nakar” to his list of titles now – much coveted, but rarely attained. To ride amongst the soaring towers, walk the winding streets and labyrinthine slums, to sit on the throne beneath the Vanetavanem, a thousand feet of soaring steel above his head – one ambition fulfilled. A decade later than what was right, perhaps.\n\nHe was here now, though. This time, he had not lost – and he had entered the city of cities in triumph. The three Mudaliar brothers were by his side, eyes downcast, sullen in defeat – they weren’t dead, though. There was no need, no need at all. Why kill them when you can keep them in power, pit them against each other, divide and conquer? Erankar smiled wider – a rare sight indeed, but today of all days it was justified. Victory rarely tasted as sweet.\n\nFinally, he reached his throne. The one used by so many great conquerors and emperors – Varanash Mudaliar, Olhokar the Fortuitous… even Ultarlan the Decimator. As he sat down, he could feel the weight of the past on his shoulders – and the promise of the future before him.\n\nErankar called the three brothers before him – bade them to kneel. He knew the strength of Nanru Nakar would be valuable in the wars to come. That left one question: how valuable was the strength of the Mudaliars?"
 larankar_events.3.a: "They are relics of an ancient past. This city is ours."
 larankar_events.3.b: "They are masters of Nakar – but will be masters of nothing else."
 larankar_events.3.c: "A strong Nanru Nakar will be a valuable agent in our new empire."

 larankar_events.4.t: "Brother's Unite!"
 larankar_events.4.da: "Erankar sent away the herald with a wave. He stared at the map of Nanru Nakar with a grimace on his face. Apparently, the three feuding sons of King Pelozhil Mudaliar despised him more than each other. The King of Larankar could still remember the look on Pelozhil’s face as he broke through his bodyguards, a storm of determined rage.\n\nErankar’s companions had to drag him away from the battlefield. He had refused to believe the battle was lost. Nothing was ever easy for him – nothing ever fell into place. That never mattered, though. Erankar added up the numbers in his head. An ally’s aid, Kriadvai’s scavengers, Kilaiek’s slavers… not unbeatable. Difficult, but not unbeatable.\n\nIf he won, he’d take it all. If he died, so be it. And if he lost, he’d come back and fight. As many times as he needed to. He’d already killed one Mudaliar king…"
 larankar_events.4.db: "In 1437, Erankar the Defiant, King of Larankar, marched against Nanru Nakar. The battle was long and fierce, but the Nakari had the better of it – then Erankar sought out King Pelozhil Mudaliar, surged forwards, and slew him with his greatsabre. Erankar lost regardless – but Pelozhil’s sons soon found themselves at odds with each other. Soon, Nakar was divided into a three-way civil war.\n\nOne might expect that this would be the perfect time to attack Nanru Nakar, with the brothers feuding and fighting amongst themselves. For most warlords, this would be true. Unfortunately, the brothers despise their father’s killer more than each other. Larankar must face their combined forces once more.\n\nThis is not as catastrophic as one might think, however – after all, if they are united as one, then they may also be conquered as one. We have already killed one Mudaliar King..."
 larankar_events.4.a: "...what's three more?"

 larankar_events.5.t: "Bound By Fear"
 larankar_events.5.da: "The treacherous warlord screamed in pain as the Orphan King threw him to the floor. Both elves were covered in blood, though only one of them had shed it. Teshalazhil Uyasmar, the exiled scion of Imarchend, was a brutal, cruel individual – but he had his uses. Fear had its uses. The greatest warlords of Erankar’s realm were gathered under one roof, watching in grim silence as Teshalazhil brutalised the traitor who one would have stood alongside them. The rumours about the Orphaned Brotherhood and its “king” had taken on a fierce power over the years. A band of rabidly anti-Kheionai mercenaries formed from the exiles of Laskaris’ conquests – recently taken over by the dark-dealing Cennayakuta, the Dogs of Imarchend.\n\nAs Teshalazhil finally finished off his prey, sinking his sabre deep into the traitor-warlord’s back, Erankar rose to address the gathered crowd. He spoke of threats within, the rebels and rabble rousers who threatened to overturn the realm they had all fought so hard to forge – whatever side they had fought on originally. He talked of the value of unity, the value of submission. The value of keeping your troops in line and your head down – looking right at the broken, bloody corpse before them.\n\n“For there is a greater threat before us!” The rising waters that made Erankar’s barb-hooked rope enticing. Ameion – invasion, occupation and annihilation. As the warlords left with gilded words and oaths of fealty, Erankar knew they understood that deeper threat. He also knew that, if he was successful, that threat would not be around forever. The binds of fear may one day unwind.\n\nBut Erankar would be ready – he would not leave his kingdom to the fickle hands of “fate”. If he had to execute a hundred-thousand traitors and more to do so, then so be it."

 larankar_events.5.a: "The Empire of Larankar will not become the Emperor of Erankar"

 larankar_events.6.t: "The Old Master"
 larankar_events.6.d: "Erankar looked again at the gold-scaled breastplate in his hands. Haltingly, he placed it at the base of the statue. An offering, taken from a fallen enemy. Eyes still down, at the base then the floor, he turned and began to walk away. He stopped though – turned back again, this time looking the statue in the eyes – he owed him that respect.\n\nErankar did not pray often, did not give offerings often. The gods seemed to show their disfavour no matter what he did. He knew that made his choice of patron even stranger. Olhokar the Fortuitous, the Slave-King, shackled to destiny’s design. On the surface they were mismatched, but beneath, the similarities were obvious. Both needed to conquer their own people, fight those they fought to protect, in order to save Taychend itself. A divine goal, though only one had it gods-given. That was their main difference. Olhokar was moved by fate like a boat on the tide – Erankar fought hard against the current. And for what? Erankar wished he had the same divine guidance Olhokar had. That same relentless direction that now coursed through Laskaris’ blood, ichor-like.\n\nThe Heretic-King stepped towards Olhokar, looked deeper into eyes once a piercing-blue. He had no pre-ordained purpose. But when he lost, faltered, he picked himself up and drove onwards anyway. Maybe he truly believed that one day, divine purpose would be handed down to him from above, a final respite. At last a reward. Or doom. That was Olhokar’s fate. The gods tired of him, and their next demand was his demise.\n\nErankar smiled, took one of his earrings off, and placed it near the statue’s base. The old master had given him guidance after all. If the gods saw fit to deny him purpose, to make calamity his fate, so be it – he’d ignore them as he always had, and forge his own design. By his will – and his will alone – he would protect Taychend. From others, and from itself."
 larankar_events.6.a: "And neither god nor elf would stop him."

 larankar_events.7.t: "Faith and Fate"
 larankar_events.7.d: "The Fateweaver’s chambers seemed to swallow up even the Emperor of Taychend. A great diamond-jewel, whose damestear glow bathed the mammoth chamber in blood. Tendrils of gilded cords, studded with arcane light, held aloft a ward-shielded skeleton, it’s skull wrenched permanently upwards. Erankar found his body moving of its own accord, ascending the steps that led to the Fateweaver’s Corpse. Laskaris had stood at this very spot, learned the date of his demise, learned his destiny.\n\nIn his heart, Erankar knew he craved the guidance given to the Kheionai, and Olhokar before him. The certainty. He could forge his own path, he could claw and bite his way through all adversity, but he could never know what was around the corner. Olhokar had gone to the grave knowing his sacrifice would save his empire. Laskaris had died with ultimate surety, exactly when he knew he would. Erankar would die knowing nothing – unless he forced Fate to tell him the truth. Soon, he stood before the Fateweaver, his palm an inch away from her skeletal face. An inch, and he would know of his and his empire’s future. Endless possibilities ran through his mind – futures of triumph, defeat, glory, horror, disappointment. Each gave him something, anything, to give his life more meaning than he’d given it. Each a frame, a place in a wider whole. A binding. A prison.\n\nErankar yanked his hand away– willed himself to step back, until at last the full enormity of Fate was in his sight. If he had placed his hand upon her cheek – if he had seen – then he would have made his life a prisoner. A slave to history, a piece in the board of all that is not him. No, that wouldn’t do. Not after giving the Taychendi the ability to carve out their own destiny. Not after claiming that right for himself.\n\nErankar turned his back on the oracle. He was not Laskaris. He was not Olhokar. He was Erankar, Warlord of Warlords! Answerable to no elf nor god nor force of fate. Until his dying breath, he would be fight for his own legacy, a destiny of his own making…"
 larankar_events.7.a: "…the Warlord-Autonomous, and the Emperor-Defiant!"
 
 larankar_events.8.t: "The Nekheis March East"
 larankar_events.8.d: "It began with whispers – rumours of secret envoys sent between the Nekheis, Kheionai spies sneaking aboard trade vessels. Then the number of traders from the west began to dwindle, as it seemed like the Nekheis were marshalling their resources, preparing for something big. Some said they were preparing to declare independence from their Alecandi masters, or else that they were expanding their colonising efforts in the Devandic interior. Few predicted their actual designs.\n\nWhen Ameion were expelled from Taychend, many initially scoffed at the massive waste of blood and treasure, scorning the pleas for aid and denigrating those who were returning from Laskaris’ failed venture. Then reality began to set in. Tens of millions of Taychendi were now united under a single warlord, a single Emperor – and they hated the Kheionai even more than the Chendhyans.\n\nThe Nekheis apparently fear that Larankar will attempt to seek retribution for Ameion’s invasion, and so they have decided to strike first. After secretly agreeing to a general alliance against us, the Nekheis have mobilised their population and began to march their armies and fleets east, hoping to dismember our budding empire before we can pose an existential threat to them."
 larankar_events.8.a: "It is time for the Kheionai to see the true strength of Taychend."
 
 larankar_events.9.t: "Sibling Rivalry"
 larankar_events.9.d: "With Taychend now firmly under our grip, the emperor’s attention can turn to other matters – namely, the Imperial Family. While our soldiers – our heir [Root.Heir.GetName] among them – have been on campaign, marching to expand our borders and secure our rule, [Root.Heir.GetName]’s children, Narathya and Tesheladar, have been locked in a vicious sibling rivalry that has threatened to undermine the succession – and potentially our empire’s future.\n\nNarathya, the elder sister, is as confident – some say arrogant – as she is innovative and well read. Holding unpopular ideas about the nature of royal power, her steadfast belief in her right to rule, and open disdain for her younger brother, has created space for Tesheladar to build his own support base. Though some call him weak, a puppet for more domineering figures, Tesheladar figures himself a man of the people, who wishes to work alongside, rather than lord over, his subjects.\n\nThough Narathya seems to be far more competent in matters of ruling, her unpopularity is troubling – supporting Tesheladar’s claim over his sister could ensure a much easier succession. Nonetheless, sometimes the harder road is the more rewarding, and our support now for Narathya now may pay off dividends later."

 #Sibling's War Event Chain
 larankar_events.100.t: "The Heirs of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 larankar_events.100.d: "While Erankar was off on campaign, his son and heir, capable in diplomacy and war alike, accompanied him – and while Seronraha was off on campaign, his wife, a steady and valued influence, accompanied him. His children were left back in Urvand, to the best tutors around, educated to the pinnacle of what a Taychendi child could be. But with their parents and grandparents not around, it appears they have not developed necessarily as had been hoped.\n\nNarathya, the elder sister, is as confident – some say arrogant – as she is innovative and well read. But she has her issues. Holding unpopular, though innovative, ideas about the nature of royal power, her steadfast belief in her right to rule and open disdain for her younger brother has created space for him to build his own support base.\n\nTesheladar is a good person, a relatively skilled warrior, and all know he is, above all, earnest. All also know of the concerns, the murmurs of hotheadedness and ill-judgement. Tesheladar figures himself an elf of the people, who wishes to work alongside, rather than lord over, his subjects – others figure him weak, a puppet for more domineering figures.\n\nIf we do not step in, there are widespread fears that should something happen to Emperor Seronraha, the two will tear each other apart, in a civil war that would tear our realm asunder. Some say that it is inevitable, but we cannot sit still and do nothing – we must either reaffirm Narathya’s succession, or replace her with Tesheladar."

 larankar_events.101.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Assassinated!"
 larankar_events.101.d: "Lanahana held her breath as the guard walked past, silent-still. Her illusions could fool most eyes, and most of her muffled footsteps, and most of her near-but-not-quite-silent breaths could slip past most untrained ears. But most was not all. All it took was an ill-timed pluck on fate’s thread for his entire plan to fall apart. That could not do. She was a master assassin of the Na’Cailana, a Cultist-in-Shadow, a devotee of Neravali – and today she killed an [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nThe assassin crept her way through the palace. Gilded, gem-encrusted furniture, curtains and rugs of the finest silk and taffeta cloth, jungle-wood deftly stolen from the outskirts of that nightmare to the north, racks of Precursor blades, glistening and ruin-made – everything she passed was the picture of opulence. It hid the blood that had been shed to raise this building. It took Lanahana’s mind off the blood that would be shed today, and that which would be shed because of today.\n\nFinally, she arrived in the Emperor’s office. He looked to be hard at work, engrossed in some report or other, eyes skimming parchment held in one hand as he absent-mindedly scribbled something down with the other. The assassin crept close to the walls, finding whatever shadow she could grasp, mindful of the way the candlelight shimmered against her glamour. Finally, she had moved behind him. She drew her blade, slowly, carefully. Took a step forwards. Then the Emperor looked up, set aside his quill and paper. The assassin froze.\n\n“I always thought I’d have more time.” He said, as he stood, pushing his chair away. “I had such plans. Such glorious plans…” [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned towards the assassin, drew a dagger from [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] belt, and charged, war-cry bellowing against the silence."
 larankar_events.101.n: "They found [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] corpse soon after. Narathya was crowned the next day."
 larankar_events.101.te: "They found [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] corpse soon after. Tesheladar was crowned the next day."

 larankar_events.102.t: "The Siblings' War" # narathya claims the throne (so for tesheladar)
 larankar_events.102.d: "“Father chose me, sister,” Tesheladar whispered to himself, as he held his head in his hands. “Father chose me, and you still do not understand. Why could you not understand?” His friends had told him his ascent would be secured. That she was smart enough to stand aside. That she could live, so long as she did not leave whatever city he decided to give her.\n\nNot friends, Tesheladar reminded himself. Advisors. He was the Emperor now, and he had no friends. Only advisors, and allies, and rivals, and daggers in the dark. That was what Takasheran had told him, last time they’d met – and the Takasangamars were usually right.\n\nHe thought one day, when she had gotten over her anger, her envy, that Narathya could be counted alongside both his advisors and his allies. And then she’d risen up in revolt, and thrown up a third of the empire against him. His first campaign would be against his own flesh and blood. And for what? It was pointless. He’d win, he had to! He was the rightful Emperor! All the major warlords were on his side!\n\nTesheladar sighed as he rose shakily. He couldn’t stop the trembling, the worrying. But he knew it would be shed with blood and battle. Father had chosen him, despite the doubts, despite the law, despite his sister’s right. He looked down on him from above, waiting for Tesheladar to fulfil what he had seen in him. Whatever he had seen in him…"
 larankar_events.102.a: "“I will not let you down, father...”"

 larankar_events.103.t: "The Siblings' War" # tesheladar claims the throne (for narathya)
 larankar_events.103.d: "Narathya watched from atop her horse as her army gathered, a scowl on her face. She could see a city of tents and stable-pens spread out before her, her supporters gathered in one decisive force – but her brother’s supporters outnumbered hers by far. She could see her soldiers dutifully prepare for the upcoming battle, as hammer struck anvil and sparring-blade struck sparring-blade – but her brother’s soldiers did so with the confidence of victory and the love of their commander in their hearts.\n\nShe knew why this had happened. The warlords were afraid of her – they knew her power, her will. Tesheladar, that weak-willed, treacherous fool, was easily manipulated. They had nearly succeeded in engineering her disinheritance – now they would force her overthrow. To anyone else, the odds would seem impossible. The seeds of rebellion, carried by her brother’s agents and allies, were sprouting everywhere. Winning a battle would only lead to another – losing a battle would mean losing everything. The world was against her – it had been since the day she was born. The people, the warlords, even her soldiers had no love for her. But that didn’t matter.\n\nNarathya looked to the sky – to the heavens. She had the blood of the defiant coursing through her veins. She could feel Erankar watching – judging – and she would not be found wanting. Through steel, and blood, and ruthless determination, she would rise. No matter the cost, no matter the struggle, she would reclaim what was rightfully hers.\n\nAnd when she found her brother, she would send him to where he rightfully belonged."
 larankar_events.103.a: "We will defy the tide."

 larankar_events.104.t: "To Steal an Empire" # narathya escapes (for tesheladar)
 larankar_events.104.d: "Tesheladar staggered through the battlefield, disbelieving. So many broken, bloodied… so many alive! There were too many broken, living people. Crying, calling for help, for aid, for intercession. It was his fault. He couldn’t bring himself to remember details, it was all a blur of thought and decision and failure. Terrible failure. He wanted to say it was miscommunication, but it was misjudgement. He had won the battle, dispersed his sister’s army – but his mistake had killed thousands.\n\nAncient steel covered the Emperor’s body from head to toe, a suit of Precursor armour worth ten years of Urvand’s gold – but he surveyed the death around him and felt a swindler. Erankar’s blade, that had once cleaved destiny itself in two, hung on his back – but he’d cut down twenty elves with it and he still felt a thief! He looked for Narathya’s body, now, so that he could finally feel like an Emperor.\n\nHe knew what the rider would say before he opened his mouth. He had not found her in the battle, and would not amongst the dead. She escaped. More of his friends – advisors, enemies, whatever! – gathered around him. They said he should split the army, go hunting. But there were rebels, enemies elsewhere – he told them but they just… ignored him! Tesheladar looked for the Mudaliars, the Dumruktams – then remembered they were not here. This was a victory he was supposed to win on his own.\n\nHis warlords closed in, begged for direction – but he pushed them aside, found a horse. “We must go to Sthanan, to Nakar, to Clemetar,” Tesheladar told them, as he mounted. “Secure the empire!” I must go to seek advice, Tesheladar told himself. I must go to seek help from those with more wisdom than me. I must secure the Empire…"
 larankar_events.104.a: "“...and finish what I started.”"

 larankar_events.1045.t: "Truth and Glory and Fear" # tesheladar escapes (for narathya)
 larankar_events.1045.d: "Narathya took a deep breath as she walked through the remains of the battle. The dead and dying surrounded her, as shattered armour and broken blades littered the ground. She took in every horror, every terrible truth of war – and as she exhaled, she let it out, and left the air in her lungs for her glory. Terror, blood, death, and glory – such as the nature of war, and of victory. And her victory was sweet – now, she only needed to confirm whether it was absolute, or but the half-way point to securing her rule.\n\nIt was the latter. One of Narathya’s warlord underlings soon arrived bearing news, and the Empress left with him. A blur, and she was back in her camp, issuing a flurry of desperate orders, sending out search parties, splitting the army, chasing down remnants, while she rushed back to the capital. Her actions were the most important, of course – Tesheladar had escaped, and she was never going to catch him.\n\nShe was reminded, in this time, of just how isolated she was, even in victory. Tesheladar had managed to court the people, gain their love, though he had done little to earn it. He could meld back into the countryside, carried away by one “loyal” merchant or another. He had likely done just that, in fact. A part of her had believed that she might be able to turn them against him. Through victory, show them that she was, in fact, the rightful queen – make them love her. She knew now, though, that was just a farce, as delusional as believing fate or destiny could drive you to glory. They would not love her – and so they would fear her. And for them to fear her, they needed to know that no traitor, be they a prince of royal blood or a farmer of peasant stock, could get away with resisting her will."
 larankar_events.1045.a: "Our legitimacy will be paid in Tesheladar’s blood."

 larankar_events.105.t: "The Pretender Resurfaces"
 larankar_events.105.d: "Taychend is a big place. Tens of millions of people, and tens of thousands of villages, towns, city-states – basically all of which are fortified against attack, surrounded by a wooden palisade at the very least. Some wonder why it is so difficult to conquer, divided as it is – when one realises just how easy it is to hide tens of thousands of warriors within its confines, they usually cease to wonder.\n\nUnfortunately, today, we have been confronted with just that reality – after months of preparation, the scorned sibling has revealed themselves, summoning their army to their banner, and beginning their long march on the capital. No matter the outcome of the upcoming battle, there is no doubt – the Siblings’ War is about to draw to a bloody conclusion, and the Empire of Erankar will once more be united, one way or another…"
 larankar_events.105.a: "Time to end this!"

 larankar_events.106.t: "Warlord-Alone" # Sibling's War Ends (Narathya)
 larankar_events.106.d: "They’d brought his body to her after the battle. Her soldiers had fell upon Tesheladar, beheaded him, stripped his body and hacked it apart. Someone had cut his ears off to get at the gold earrings. She had wanted to spit on the traitor’s corpse. Instead, she just stared down at him, unblinking – and empty. When she retired to her tent that night, and as she rode back to the capital, the train of war-prizes miles long behind her, she could not shake that melancholy that seemed to overtake her. Nobody tried to console her, talk to her, anything.\n\nTesheladar would have had the opposite problem, she knew. Hundreds of warlords and notables constantly in his ear, trying to sway him this way and that. She sensed no disloyalty, no renewed treason, not yet. Her subjects did what they told, her advisors gave her their opinion, when asked. Maybe they were all still in shock. Maybe she was too. The odds were so against her it must have seemed a miracle that she survived – but her confidence and her genius had saw her through. And now she stood atop an empire of corpses, all opposition broken by her blade.\n\nWithin her hands – at her command – she had the power to stand against the massed desires of those beneath her, and the current of history itself. As Narathya re-entered Urvand, watched the silent faces stare at her, in awe and in fear, utterly apart, distant, she understood what she was: isolated, and in her isolation all-powerful. She did not need to rely on their love, she did not need to rely on their support – by her determined will, she could shape the world itself, one battle, one crushed revolt at a time…"
 larankar_events.106.a: "“...the Warlord-Alone, and the Warlord-Autonomous.”"

 larankar_events.107.t: "The White-Feathered Cowl" # siblings war ends (tesheladar)
 larankar_events.107.d: "He had wanted to kill her by his own hands, make it clean, a heroic end maybe, but it didn’t matter. He had not wanted to see her corpse, but the vultures told him to make his presence known. His soldiers had beheaded her, stripped her gilded armour, hacked her body apart. Someone had cut Narathya’s ears off to get at the gold earrings. Tesheladar had flown into a rage, and made Kattisangamar and Varamraya rebellious for a generation, and then he had fled to his tent. He alternated between vomiting and staring at the ground, head in his hands and eyes wide. \n\nHe hadn’t been able to sleep properly since the battle. Narathya followed him in the night. And the day was filled with worry, and he asked over and over if it was worth it and received no reply. The peasants loved him, the warlords clamoured to be by his side, and yet still he fell deeper into the abyss, and the depths were black and cold. The vultures had pulled him to and fro with their sweet words. They had fooled him into thinking he was the rightful heir, that he was better, greater, more capable and generous, that his father would see that – that he did. He knew, now, that his father had not chosen him. His father had chosen them. But his father was dead, and he would not be fooled again.\n\nThe gilded armour always tarnishes, the morals of the righteous always falter, and the soaring eagle always descends, and sheds its white-feathered cowl. They called him the Warlord-Autonomous – but he knew there was no such thing. They circled around him, trying to trick and swindle him – but now, he saw them for what they were. In that knowledge, he was truly free. Within the abyss, he would try his best. It was all he could do, after all.\n\nAnd in giving all, he would raise himself from the darkness, and into the light…"
