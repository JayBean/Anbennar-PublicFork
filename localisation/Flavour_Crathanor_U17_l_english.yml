 crathanor_embrace_the_two_principles_desc:0 "Unlike the other states around us, monarchies that seek to conquer and subjugate for glory, and theocracies that enshrine their rule based on the whims of their divines, our ideals are different; free market, and free trade.

 crathanor_mouth_of_the_river_desc:0 "The mouth of the Suran is the nexus of all trade that flows from the east, the culmination of a land filled with riches and splendour, and therefore of vital importance if we are to dominate the Divenhal. In order to ensure we can do this, we need to take precautions to make sure others do not seize it first. Specifically, our main concerns are the ashen legions of Sareyand, and the Jaddari zealots. It is time to leverage our might to make such endeavours inconvenient."

 crathanor_secure_the_shipyards_desc:0 "As we look east to the rest of Aqatbahar, we see yet more goblins infesting the great city of Aqatbar. Not only is one of the most significant cities of Bulwar, the surrounding coastline holds many important shipyards and ports, making it vital for Bahar’s merchants.

 crathanor_heartlands_of_the_sun_desc:0 "And now for the greatest prize of them all: Bulwar!

 crathanor_concurring_with_court_desc:0 "As per the Regent Courtier demands, we must build and expand their temples across Bahar, so we can assure them they will not simply be subsumed by the Sun Cult.

 crathanor_consulting_with_cult_desc:0 "Now that the Regent Court followers’ conditions are met, we must contend with the Sun Cultists’. Their demands are for us to conquer the Goblin heathens and the Old Sun Cultist heretics of Eastern Bahar, so we may purge and convert them,restoring unity to the land.

 crathanor_broken_sceptre_beautiful_sun_desc:0 "News from the west claims Castellos is dead, and Cannor has fallen into shock and disarray because of it, choosing sides over his successors. But not us, we see another truth of the matter, that Castellos is not dead, Castellos is Surael. With this new revelation washing over us like the cool waters of the Divenhal, we seek to unite our people under one faith, under one truth: The Lightfather!"
 
 crathanor_kings_conquerors_title:0 "Neither Kings nor Conquerors"
 crathanor_kings_conquerors_desc:0 "When the first Ilatani boots landed upon our ancestral shores, we could nary hold back from tears. What has been denied and lost to us for so long has now, finally, been returned. Even if it is only this piece of Itrahureš we now hold, soon enough we will regain all of our rightful lands. This time, we do not return to our ancient home as kings like Arameh, or conquerors like Jexis, we are the rightful people of this land, and we demand our due."
 
 crathanor_shores_of_sorrow_title:0 "On Shores of Sorrow"
 crathanor_shores_of_sorrow_desc:0 "Few traders in the Divenhal have not seen the majesty of the Mother’s Sorrow and marvelled at its wonders. Within the great delta, the marvellous city of Koroshesh glimmers as a light upon the shore, and upriver the great and ancient city of Kheterat lies. These waters see hundreds of ships pass every way, every port near and within the delta sees goods from every corner of Sarhal. Letting such a prime opportunity like this pass us by would be a grave mistake. We will claim these shores in the name of the Republic! Whether through coin or cannonfire!"

 crathanor_letting_mother_rest_desc:0 "The Mother's Sorrow has raged of late, both with the sound of Itrahureši cannons and artillery battering the defenders, and the water itself seemingly agitated at our transgression. In order to combat and calm this river, we must first respect it. By sending our good will and wishes along the Sorrow to the very beginning of the river at Lake Nirakhet, we should hopefully convince both the Khet and hopefully even the great mother herself of our honest intentions. Already it seems as though it has slightly calmed since the fighting ceased, but we cannot be too safe."

All have suffered the death of a friend or loved one at their hands. And yet now, the despicable upstarts of the Landshark dare to court foreign merchants with goods harvested from our shores on ships stolen from our ports! No more! For the good of all civilised people we must retake our lands and drive these monsters back into the mountains!"

 crathanor_empires_kingdoms_clans_desc:0 "Ourdia has been ruled by many states, first was the great empire of Castanor, whose will spanned the Divenhal and whose might was unmatched. Next came the Phoenix, whose brilliant light shone from the Divenhal to the far shores of the end of the world itself. Lastly the great Kingdom of Ourdia, who once stood as a beacon of civilization itself, but whose legacy now dimly glows, as ours is just beginning to shine. This land holds three great legacies, but it is evident soon a fourth, ours, must take its place."

 crathanor_rebirth_of_crathanor_desc:0 "Under our guidance, the western lands of Bahar have gone from wartorn hellscapes, battling Gnolls, Goblins, and each other, to a united and prosperous land, where the banners of our Resplendent Republic fly from the bustling cities and ports to the remote mountains and highlands. We must now renovate the marketplaces of these gemstone cities: Re-Uyel, Bal Ouord, Crathano, Ovdal Tûngr, and Gemisle, as to ensure our merchants can trade freely throughout this realm, and bind the lands together through commerce and profit."
 
 crathanor_returning_home_title:0 "Returning Home"

 crathanor_ilatani_revival_desc:0 "It is done! Finally, our home is ours once more, a wondrous occasion! The people rejoice as the realm is bound together; Bahar and Busilar, together at last. But as we do this, there are a few last things we must do. Port Jaher, the old capital of our realm, must be renovated. At the same time, the Busilari must be reintegrated with the state, to ensure our lost brothers and sisters do not become resentful of our homecoming. This is no conquest, this is a restoration of Itrahureš!"

 crathanor_control_twin_passages_desc:0 "The isle of Tef is ours, and that means the Divenhal’s gate is under our grasp, and thus we are this sea’s lords, and its many riches and opportunities are ours. But what of Akasik? That great and bountiful land whose people suffer from the cruel whip of the tyrannical, reaving Gnollish pirates of Viakkoc. Who shall save them, and who shall ensure that the galleys of those pirates never touch our shores, never plunder our cities, and never destroy our hard work? We shall."

 crathanor_spear_points_east_desc:0 "With the vital ports of Tef and Akasik secured in the hands of our new Nahišabates, it is high time to put our differences aside and band together against our common foe. For too long have the seascourge gnolls of Akasik raided our shores, enslaved our people, and condemned their souls in the hands of their demonic masters. For the good of all people this barbaric trade must end, and its practitioners put to the sword."

 crathanor_edge_of_bulwar_desc:0 "Crathano lies at the very edge of Bulwar, and has served as an important centre of commerce harkening back to the days of our ancestors of the Kingdom of Kišakur. Recently however, our war of independence and the devastation wrought by the foul goblins has destroyed large tracts of the city. Let us rebuild this place, even greater than before."

 crathanor_monopolize_sapphire_trade_desc:0 "Every Ilatani young or old has seen or heard of the magnificent “Sapphires of the Sea,” famed for their beautiful hues of seemingly infinite blue, shimmering with splendour and majesty. Mined on the aptly named Gemisle, it has for centuries served as a great source of income, financing and funding economies throughout history. Now it has been rightfully returned to the Ilatani people and the Cobalt Dwarves who call the island home. Increasing production and stabilising supply routes to and from the island would surely increase revenue, allowing us to extract and sell even more of the rare sapphires to buyers across the Divenhal!"
 
 crathanor_cursed_north_title:0 "The Cursed North"
 crathanor_cursed_north_desc:0 "North of Bahar is the infamous ‘Daravan’s Folly’, where that foolish Korbarid King cast a spell to stave off the Gnollish invaders, only for the deluge to drown half his Kingdom. While it is certainly a place many of us dread, none can deny that the Gnolls there are a threat we cannot ignore. \n\nWe shall cross Bal Ouord, and with the help of the adventurers and mages of our realm, strike back against these flamemarked foes, and bring even the cursed north through which the Dostanesck flows into our domain!"

 crathanor_crathanori_calm_desc:0 "The Folly is now ours, the Gnolls beaten back and subjugated, and thus the Dostanesck, the great lifeline that connects Escann to the Divenhal is controlled by us. Still, there is more work to do. The lands we have gained must be repaired and restored, no matter the difficulties in doing so. Bal Ouord and Nathalaire must also be bolstered with additional defences to ensure they do not fall victim to piracy or invasion."

 crathanor_renovate_old_home_desc:0 "With our home back in our grasp, we have learned of how it has changed in the many years since we were last here. In some ways it has become better, in many more it has become worse. No matter, we shall strive to make it as resplendent as our Republic! The city of Port Jaher will be expanded, renovated, and restored! As well as this, we shall fortify its harbour, to ensure that the city stays our home forevermore."
 
 crathanor_cultural_capital_title:0 "A Cultural, Modern Capital"
 crathanor_cultural_capital_desc:0 "Now that Abtanus has been refurbished and fortified, it's time to take it one step further. Ilatani architecture shall be restored across the city, taking this sunrise port from merely the best city in Businor, to one that outshines Anbenncost and its own sister Brasan in terms of sheer splendour and wonder. When they look upon Ascajar Palace, they shall wonder how it was ever anything but a wonder of the Lightfather."

 flavor_crathanor.1.d:0 "It was afternoon when all the merchants had finally arrived at the manse, an ostentatious building at the edge of Crathánor, staring off into the Divenhal. Each of these men and women were famous and renowned throughout the Divenhal for their wealth, and would be considered peerless in many other ports and cities, yet peers they had become for a single and united purpose: The Declaration of Crathánor.\n\nInside, their host, a middle aged man by the name of Arvand szal-Vasaro, began to speak. “My brothers and sisters, I gather us here today to discuss the great steps our nation and people have taken towards this bright future, and the steps we must take to keep going. Starting today, we shall begin the formation of a permanent assembly of merchants to rival any other faction in Crathánor, so we may bring about the Two Principles free from the meddling of priests and would-be nobles, and bring the new dawn of Crathánor!”\n\nAs the assembly roared in applause, the priests and ex-nobles sent their response, as violence broke out in the streets, as thugs hired and those riled up by enemies of the merchants began to clash with guards, spilling out into Crathánor and Hopespeak." 
 flavor_crathanor.1.a:0 "They forget their place. Let us remind them." 
  
 flavor_crathanor.2.t:0 "A Constitution Forged" 
 flavor_crathanor.2.d:0 "While the fighting over the past few years has been fierce indeed, it seems it is mostly behind us. While some ex-nobles and priests still shake their fists and grumble from the sidelines, most have realised they can no longer stop or subvert us. But in order to best work towards the interests of the Republic and to absorb the more moderate and agreeable opponents of ours, we have offered the opportunity to join us in forging the Constitution of Crathánor, and therefore ensure they have some say over what goes in, even if the broad strokes are immutable. With this, we will prevent most of the backlash this will create and ensure Crathánor’s new dawn is near unanimous."

 flavor_crathanor.3.d:0 "Crathánor have been our steadfast allies against the threat of Goblins and opportunistic rivals alike. For years now we have fought, bled, and died together, but today they bring us a rare, yet tempting offer. In exchange for our nominal sovereignty, they offer to finance, support, and bolster our already impressive naval capabilities. While they are our good friends, and we owe them quite a bit over the years, ultimately the decision falls to us."

They have read our offer and soundly rejected it, stating that no amount of convincing could ever hope to sway them as far as to assign away their nation’s sovereignty. While we understand this sentiment well, this is a major blow to our prestige, and indeed many across the nation hold their head in their hands at this news."

 flavor_crathanor.6.d:0 "Once the Copper Dwarves were our allies, now they are an equal partner to our Republic, but perhaps they should be even more? With Ovdal-Tûngr’s navies kept separate to our own and allowed to keep their specialties, no fleet could stand against us. We would be as two sisters, sailing to the horizon together. But perhaps instead we could integrate them fully into our realm and have them as yet another flourish in the great work of art that is Crathánor."

 flavor_crathanor.9.d:0 "The first of the debates began with fierce battles of rhetoric by both the priests of Castellos and of Surael, before progressing to arguments and bickering, and even an incident of one priest punching another. This violence, while to be expected on some level from the nature of the discussions, spiralled out of control as those in the streets outside the debate got into fights over the proceedings.\n\nThrough the chaos, however, two priests, one of each faith, came together and broke the violence with raised hands and a combined call for peace and cooperation. “Are we not neighbours, are we not kin? We need not fight when reason and debate are not yet forlorn!” While the speech did much to calm the riots, the discussion still needed to be hashed out inside. At the end of it all, the priests of Castellos had a demand: additional temples to be constructed across Crathánor, to ensure they stood as an equal to the priests of Surael.\n\nMuch of the New Sun Cult, while deeply unhappy with losing majority influence over the religion of Crathánor, were persuaded by the moderates within their faction to concede, in exchange for cooperation in the debates to come and favours from the president. While overall a victory for those seeking to truly unite the priesthoods under one banner, it was simply the first step in a long journey."

They broadly resent the lack of any mandates fulfilled on their side, and insist that in order for them to reconcile with the Court, Bahar must be brought under the Crathánori banner, so they can stomp out both the heretics who refuse to acknowledge the Council of Brasan and the foul goblin heathens. The Regent Courtiers are content with this, as long as Ourdia stays under their religion. Near the conclusion of this debate, the President attempted to speak about the need for cooperation and harmony amongst the faiths, but it seemed that until both sides had been appeased, they would be met with deaf ears."

 flavor_crathanor.11.d:0 "The Third Debate began with an air of calm over the two factions, time and compromise having dulled much of the hardline stances, whittling down the extremists so that only the most reasonable of points remained. Both the priests of the Court and Surael were pleased at our adherence to their mandates, which had done much to speed up the process and smooth over disagreements.\n\nDuring this debate, the President stood to give their speech. It spoke of the progress they had made, the harmony achieved by the debates in the past. “Over these debates, we have grown from enemies, to allies, and now friends, and soon, our stance on the Sun Cult and the Regent Court will reflect this!” They said in a crescendo, and yet as some priests began to applaud, they were cut off by the final part, “As to finish the task laid out before us, I shall propose a mandate of my own. I propose that to truly harmonise, we must consider a perspective that fits that of us all. That Castellos, the lord of the skies and ruler of the Regent Court, and Surael, the gardener and the sun, are one in the same.”\n\nHis words shocked all who heard them, and mutterings erupted in waves, murmurs of confusion, doubt, even anger. But when the words had settled in their minds, agreement was soon the common reaction. This syncretism was certainly not without flaws and issues, but it was one that had long been on the minds of many a priest, philosopher, or great thinker of Crathánor, and so the discussions, loud and quiet, raged over the coming weeks on this subject."

Let us set sail and show them what we have become! Let the world know, Dameria, Castanor, and the Hierarchy had their place in the sun, the world will know the name Itrahureš!

 #Lightfather Loc Events
 
 flavor_crathanor.15.t:0 "Favored by the Gods - Lightfather"
 flavor_crathanor.15.d:0 "Many worshippers of the Regent Court feel a close association with one member of the pantheon or another, but few live their lives as devotees of one deity before all others. Even among those that do, it is rare to find an individual whose character and deeds reflect their patron deity in their every action. Such individuals are sometimes called Emulants, and the priesthood of [Root.GetName] has noted that the great piety, justice, and majesty of [Root.Monarch.GetName] may mark them as a chosen exemplar of the Lightfather. Several clerics have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to recommend further religious devotion to specific aspects of the god, though there appears to be a split among the priests about which part of the Lightfather's portfolio that we might dedicate our time to.\n\nSpending many of your waking hours in prayer, study, and ritual would take your focus from the direct administration of the realm and require the delegation of some important responsibilities, but could yield major spiritual enlightenment. Will you pursue the wisdom of the gods further, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 flavor_crathanor.15.a:0 "I shall dedicate myself to the emulation of the Lightfather, the Lightbringer."
 flavor_crathanor.15.b:0 "I shall dedicate myself to the emulation of the Lightfather, the Guide of Man."
 flavor_crathanor.15.c:0 "I may be favored by the Lightfather, but I do not have the time for years of religious contemplation."
 
 flavor_crathanor.16.t:0 "Emulant - The Lightbringer"
 flavor_crathanor.16.d:0 "It has been five years of devotion, of spiritual search, of meditation and ritual and the dedication of your waking hours to activities that would lead you closer to understanding the Lightfather's divine nature. It has not always been easy, and the fervency of this personal quest has caused hardships, missed opportunities, and time that cannot be reclaimed. Despite this, there is no denying that your understanding of the Lightfather has deepened.\n\nOne evening, as you pour over ledgers concerning the health of your realm, you cannot help but recall the story of the world's creation, and how the Lightfather's cooperation with the other deities led to the birth of the whole of the world around you. It was in concord with Uelos, Halanna, Yshtraliana, and Agrados that the continents and oceans were formed and countless races were birthed. Truly the Lightfather is the father of this world, and thus all people who call it home. One can only strive to turn their own small corner of this vast world into a fitting replica of that first paradise - and looking around at the land you rule, you cannot help but think that the Lightfather smiles on your efforts to be as benevolent a father to your people as he is to all mortals. As you go forward, you have no doubt that your connection with the Lightfather will make you a better, fairer, and more capable ruler."
 flavor_crathanor.16.a:0 "I am as the Lightfather, and he is as I."
 
 flavor_crathanor.17.t:0 "Emulant - The Guide of Man"
 flavor_crathanor.17.d:0 "No man is an island, and among the gods this is doubly true. While the Lightfather rules the collection of deities that are bound together in the Regent Court, the king of the gods is far from all-powerful. After the Lightfather was maimed saving Adean from the dragon Malliath's maw, his time away from his throne has been minimal. Despite his lack of mobility, however, the Lightfather is still an effective and well-respected ruler, for he knows that only a fool fails to rely on the talents of those around him, and the deities of the Regent Court report to the Lightfather on the many tasks he has set forth for them. In this way, though the Lightfather may have only one hand, he can draw back the bow or raise the sword through Falah and Adean. Though he has but one leg, his will can reach as far as Munas can sail and Nathalyne can flit.\n\nIt is this last thought that strikes you as you hold court today and look upon the petitioners and courtiers who have come before you. Diplomats, businessmen, officers - what a diversity of skills exists in this room, just a small sample of that to be found in the realm. They remind you of silver tongued Minara, shrewd Ara, brave Adean - a host of great beings to govern the heavens, aiding the Lightfather in his just rule. No ruler can know every detail of a land or specialize in every topic in the world, and history is littered with examples of those who have micromanaged their realms into oblivion. No - the Lightfather is surely guiding you today, his gentle hand bringing together this collection of talented individuals. With the help of those in your court you will be well advised and ensure the just governance of your realm - just as the regent court, working together in harmony, capably administers the heavens."
