The Crathánori Merchant Class extends a hand of mercy and invites them to write a new constitution, and despite the ability to completely bully them into cooperating, the ex-nobles and clergy are surprised at the level of dignity and respect they are still showed.

In the midst of all this chaos, they shake hands, intent on making this dream a reality. For now, the Regent Court adherents demand the construction of more temples across our lands, in order to ensure the worship of the Court does not become subsumed by NSC worship, and in exchange they .

They demand we fully take all of Bahar, and allow the NSC clergy (we only took land from the RC clergy earlier on),to deal with and stomp out both the OSC heretics and the Goblinic heathens. Should we fulfill this, we will be one step closer to ensuring their further support for our dream of Religious harmony, and th.

The NSC adherents in parliament are very pleased that we kept our promise, and they will begin preparations to convert the heretics and heathens of Bahar shortly. With both the Court and Cult adherents pleased, the president themself begins their speech. Both sides listen attentively, as the president once more speaks of peace, cooperation, and above all harmony between the Court and the Cult. For the first time since the debates began, adherents to both sides quietly begin to reconsider and agree with the president. The President finally makes his last proposal, that with the newfound unity in the country, Castellos and Surael are one and the same. That Castellos, the head god of the Regent Court, is in fact Surael. Adherents to both are stunned, however with their newfound trust in the state, they do not immediately react with outrage. Slowly, people both within parliament and outside begin to see the truth in the President's words, and philosophers, priests, and every thinker low and high begin to slowly embrace this new syncretism."

 #Lightfather Loc Events
 
 flavor_crathanor.15.t:0 "Favored by the Gods - Lightfather"
 flavor_crathanor.15.d:0 "Many worshippers of the Regent Court feel a close association with one member of the pantheon or another, but few live their lives as devotees of one deity before all others. Even among those that do, it is rare to find an individual whose character and deeds reflect their patron deity in their every action. Such individuals are sometimes called Emulants, and the priesthood of [Root.GetName] has noted that the great piety, justice, and majesty of [Root.Monarch.GetName] may mark them as a chosen exemplar of the Lightfather. Several clerics have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to recommend further religious devotion to specific aspects of the god, though there appears to be a split among the priests about which part of the Lightfather's portfolio that we might dedicate our time to.\n\nSpending many of your waking hours in prayer, study, and ritual would take your focus from the direct administration of the realm and require the delegation of some important responsibilities, but could yield major spiritual enlightenment. Will you pursue the wisdom of the gods further, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 flavor_crathanor.15.a:0 "I shall dedicate myself to the emulation of the Lightfather, the Lightbringer."
 flavor_crathanor.15.b:0 "I shall dedicate myself to the emulation of the Lightfather, the Guide of Man."

 flavor_crathanor.16.t:0 "Emulant - The Lightbringer"
 flavor_crathanor.16.d:0 "It has been five years of devotion, of spiritual search, of meditation and ritual and the dedication of your waking hours to activities that would lead you closer to understanding the Lightfather's divine nature. It has not always been easy, and the fervency of this personal quest has caused hardships, missed opportunities, and time that cannot be reclaimed. Despite this, there is no denying that your understanding of the Lightfather has deepened.\n\nOne evening, as you pour over ledgers concerning the health of your realm, you cannot help but recall the story of the world's creation, and how the Lightfather's cooperation with the other deities led to the birth of the whole of the world around you. It was in concord with Uelos, Halanna, Yshtraliana, and Agrados that the continents and oceans were formed and countless races were birthed. Truly the Lightfather is the father of this world, and thus all people who call it home. One can only strive to turn their own small corner of this vast world into a fitting replica of that first paradise - and looking around at the land you rule, you cannot help but think that the Lightfather smiles on your efforts to be as benevolent a father to your people as he is to all mortals. As you go forward, you have no doubt that your connection with the Lightfather will make you a better, fairer, and more capable ruler."
 flavor_crathanor.16.a:0 "I am as the Lightfather, and he is as I."
 
 flavor_crathanor.17.t:0 "Emulant - The Guide of Man"
 flavor_crathanor.17.d:0 "No man is an island, and among the gods this is doubly true. While the Lightfather rules the collection of deities that are bound together in the Regent Court, the king of the gods is far from all-powerful. After the Lightfather was maimed saving Adean from the dragon Malliath's maw, his time away from his throne has been minimal. Despite his lack of mobility, however, the Lightfather is still an effective and well-respected ruler, for he knows that only a fool fails to rely on the talents of those around him, and the deities of the Regent Court report to the Lightfather on the many tasks he has set forth for them. In this way, though the Lightfather may have only one hand, he can draw back the bow or raise the sword through Falah and Adean. Though he has but one leg, his will can reach as far as Munas can sail and Nathalyne can flit.\n\nIt is this last thought that strikes you as you hold court today and look upon the petitioners and courtiers who have come before you. Diplomats, businessmen, officers - what a diversity of skills exists in this room, just a small sample of that to be found in the realm. They remind you of silver tongued Minara, shrewd Ara, brave Adean - a host of great beings to govern the heavens, aiding the Lightfather in his just rule. No ruler can know every detail of a land or specialize in every topic in the world, and history is littered with examples of those who have micromanaged their realms into oblivion. No - the Lightfather is surely guiding you today, his gentle hand bringing together this collection of talented individuals. With the help of those in your court you will be well advised and ensure the just governance of your realm - just as the regent court, working together in harmony, capably administers the heavens."
