 krak_clan_council_desc:0 "Our system of meritocratic recruitment means that our council is always filled with the best and brightest from our hold. It calls for frequent elections so that no ruler may gain too much power and thereby exert control over the others. Or that's how it used to work. Now the power cycles between one of the five major clans. Their hasty short-term planning has kept our country from thriving."
 krak_free_council:0 "Free Council"
 krak_free_council_desc:0 "A reformed version of the old Clan Council, the new Free Council system employs an elected council in each hold which will govern that hold itself and report to a larger council body in Krakdhûmvror. Any dwarf from a poor miner to a rich merchant will be allowed to take the exams for office and thereby put themselves up for election, which will be based purely on qualification."
 krak_monarchy:0 "Krakdhûmvroric Monarchy"
 krak_monarchy_desc:0 "We have consolidated power behind the Frozenforge clan. May they maintain the traditions of competence and meritocracy that have so shaped our people and be themselves their pinnacle! The councils of each hold will report to a larger assembly in Krakdhûmvror at the head of which will sit the King. This way the previous system can be used to manage the holds, while the king manages them and the realm."

 flavor_krak.1.t:0 "Midjurdr Kralt"
 flavor_krak.1.d:0 "The ancient fortress of Midjurdr Kralt, upon whose foundations the hold of Krakdhûmvror was built, still sits proudly. Its strong walls rest firm, but unused, in the center of our oldest district.\n\nWe should refurbish the old stronghold and find a use for it once again. We have had many proposals for its refurbishment over the years, restoring its garrison, using it as a government building, some even propose tearing it down and building something else. We should take our pick, and see it done."
 flavor_krak.1.a:0 "Our government could use the extra space."
 flavor_krak.1.b:0 "Modernize the defenses and refit the garrison!"
 flavor_krak.1.c:0 "Tear the old girl down and make way for the future."
 flavor_krak.2.t:0 "The Thundersteel Commission"
 flavor_krak.2.d:0 "One of the council members, Ugrim Thundersteel, has been doing some research into the income our expansion thus far has brought us and says we have gained much wealth from it. He has put forward a proposal which he calls the 'Thundersteel Commission'. If we follow this plan of calculated expansion across the Giant's Anvil range and into the Northern Pass, we will be able to solidify our hold rapidly and lucratively."
 flavor_krak.2.a:0 "I've always wondered what it looks like outside the mountain..."
 flavor_krak.3.t:0 "Noble Outrage"
 flavor_krak.3.d:0 "After our armies marched on the nobility to seize their lands and assets, the nobles rose up in the streets of Krakdhûmvror and rebelled against our 'acts of tyranny'. If they think that causing damage to the hold will make us see their reason, they are very mistaken."
 flavor_krak.3.a:0 "The army will get this under control, but the damage has largely been done."
 flavor_krak.4.t:0 "The Dead End Mines"
 flavor_krak.4.d:0 "Our prospecting efforts in the Dead End Tunnel have paid off! Just as we'd hoped, copious iron veins, crucial to our Ice-Steel smithing operations, have been struck all down the tunnel's length and we've found large pockets of gemstones right at the end. We need to get some mines set up right away!"
 flavor_krak.4.a:0 "The iron wealth of the Anvil is ours!"
 flavor_krak.5.t:0 "Conflicting Interests"
 flavor_krak.5.d:0 "With all the new resources coming out of the Dead End Mines, the various guilds and factories are beginning to fight over them. With the influx of resources came influx of business and without any regulation there is now a great imbalance in our hold's production."
 flavor_krak.5.a:0 "If only we'd thought of this sooner."
 flavor_krak.6.t:0 "Disunity"
 flavor_krak.6.d:0 "With our expansion efforts well under way we find ourselves torn between two major parties. One side wishes to see us claim the Northern Pass and worry over the news of strange orcs in Gerudia that could threaten our endeavours. The other believes we must focus all of our efforts on reclaiming Amldihr, the seat of the Dwarovar.\n\nWe cannot do both effectively enough to satisfy everyone and they seem to find no compromise acceptable. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] may see [Root.GetName] torn between these two unbudging forces."
 flavor_krak.6.a:0 "At least they both still want to expand."
 flavor_krak.7.t:0 "Massacre on the Dagrinrod!"
 flavor_krak.7.d:0 "The hasty push into the Dagrinrod from Dûr-Vazhatun resulted in poorly manned garrisons and unprotected colonists. The local goblins were far from exterminated, and they laid waste to the colonies, butchering its citizens, and stealing their supplies, leaving smouldering, broken ruins in their wake. The people are calling for an ousting of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and for an election to take place immediately."
 flavor_krak.7.a:0 "This tragedy could've been avoided with proper preparation."
 flavor_krak.7.tooltip:0 "§RWill be destroyed§!"
 flavor_krak.8.t:0 "Unsteady Rule"
 flavor_krak.8.d:0 "With our expansion taking us into several holds now, the people's trust in our government has begun to wane. They say that our system does not work when controlling more than one hold, that too much is at stake for such short-sighted leadership as we have recently seen.\n\nThere are those still loyal who speak on our behalf but riots in the streets of Amldihr have been wreaking havoc and ruin on its holds."
 flavor_krak.8.a:0 "The nation is falling to pieces around us!"

 #after disaster
 flavor_krak.9.t:0 "A Steady Path"
 flavor_krak.9.d:0 "Our first major surface infrastructure is finished!\n\nThe system of regularly maintained and guarded roads run from our northern expedition headquarters in Fýllstýn, past the Hardy Hole gate, across Tanning Valley, and straight to the doors of Dûr-Vazhatun. Inns and outposts are already popping up along its length and our supply caravans have no bad news to report!"
 flavor_krak.9.a:0 "Our roads will criss-cross the whole Pass before long!"
 flavor_krak.10.t:0 "The Great Expedition"
 flavor_krak.10.d:0 "Our troops are trained, our Ice-Smiths are prepared and well stocked for research, the supplies are all in place. Five thousand dwarves will march out to explore, map, and scour the wastes for secrets and treasures! The Great Expedition north can commence! We shall find out what happened to the giants and their treasures, or whatever other strange mysteries lie in wait for us out there!"
 flavor_krak.10.a:0 "Northward we go!"
 flavor_krak.11.t:0 "In the Wastes"
 flavor_krak.11.d:0 "As cold as we thought the peaks of the Giant's Anvil were, we did not realize just how truly freezing it can get up north in the Wastes. We were not prepared to face such drastic temperatures even with our Ice-Smiths serving as auxiliaries. Not to mention stumbling near-blind through a blizzard only to be attacked by a roving herd of mammoths!\n\nWe have found a few interesting objects and relics that warrant further study, but otherwise this has been more of an exercise in poor planning."
 flavor_krak.11.a:0 "Let's just hope they can get back safely."
 flavor_krak.12.t:0 "The Expedition Returns"
 flavor_krak.12.d:0 "Our explorers have returned from the north. While there was no bounty discovered, nor did all of the company survive the trip, the expedition as a whole has been a good learning experience. We can deal with colder temperatures if we are prepared, and mammoths are easy enough to avoid or deal with when one has the proper tools. We should think about sending more expeditions out there in the future!"
 flavor_krak.12.a:0 "We learned what to do, and we will return."
 flavor_krak.13.t:0 "The Krakdhûmrod"
 flavor_krak.13.d:0 "The Krakdhûmrod is done! This great series of rails is connected to the Dagrinrod in Dûr-Vazhatun and runs through Tanning Valley into the Giant's Anvil and then straight into Krakdhûmvror. For the first time in history, our far-flung hold has been connected to the Dwarovrod rail network!"
 flavor_krak.13.a:0 "Let the commuting commence!"
 flavor_krak.14.t:0 "The Second Expedition"
 flavor_krak.14.d:0 "Our explorers are ready, all kitted out in their special fur heavy winter gear, Ice-Steel equipment hanging from their packs or stored in ram-driven sleighs. More supplies, more Ice-Smiths, and more planning has gone into this endeavour and this time, we will not fail!"
 flavor_krak.14.a:0 "North comrades! Into the Wastes!"
 flavor_krak.15.t:0 "Second Time in the Wastes"
 flavor_krak.15.d:0 "This time the cold was expected and prepared for. Our explorers were unharried by the severe weather and snow, making it much further north than last time. The hunters were able to deal with the wildlife with relative ease and our Ice-Smiths found some remnants of giant bones in several remote places. Still nothing all that special though..."
 flavor_krak.15.a:0 "Our dominion over the cold takes another step forward!"
 flavor_krak.16.t:0 "The Second Expedition Returns"
 flavor_krak.16.d:0 "Our brave explorers have returned and brought some interesting things back with them this time! While there were still some lost to the cold and the beasts, it was a much smaller number, to be predicted in such extreme conditions. All in all, this trip north brought much more reward than trouble and bodes well for more expeditions in the future."
 flavor_krak.16.a:0 "I wonder what else is out there in the ice?"
 flavor_krak.17.t:0 "The Nortumrod"
 flavor_krak.17.d:0 "The Nortumrod is finally complete and ready for use. A grand highway that could fit five wagons abreast, runs from Seldizâd to Fýllstýn by way of Skordhûmad and the Giant's Anvil entrance at Hardy Hole. The highway is patrolled and has regular outpost towns set up along its length. During the winter, special Ice-Smiths enchant the road to keep the snow away from it, leaving it open and ready all year round.\n\nTruly we have completed a marvel of dwarven ingenuity."
 flavor_krak.17.a:0 "It's so much nicer to travel by road, don't you think?"
 flavor_krak.18.t:0 "Hidden in the Mountain Store"
 flavor_krak.18.d:0 "Our prospectors have returned to us with excellent news! The Lonely Mountain holds iron and copper in great abundance! We have already set up new mining operations to begin extracting the ore. Soon Seldizâd will be filled with ore-laden wagons headed for the Anvil."
 flavor_krak.18.a:0 "You can never have too much ore."
 flavor_krak.19.t:0 "The Great Ice-Warding Spell"
 flavor_krak.19.d:0 "The towers have been erected and the Ice-Smiths have prepared groups at each one. They have made special enchanted structures which will be housed within the topmost floor of each tower. These structures have harnessed the cold and moisture from the air across the Northern Pass and the mountains that border it and condensed it around the towers they are mounted in to create storm clouds which seem anchored to the towers. After a few days, the clouds spiralling around each tower should connect and the storm will be unbroken from Skordhûmad to Khugsland. This blizzard and permanent covering of the skies will create an unbearably cold winter for all those who are not hardy Quartz Dwarves or arctic animals. This is the grandest use of the Ice-Smiths' Ice-Field spell and they claim they have learned a great deal about how to apply it elsewhere from this endeavour.\n\nThey also say that there has been some very strange magical feedback coming from up north that they have since calibrated their machines for. It seems this massive use of ice magic has reacted with something hidden out in the Frozen Wastes. Perhaps this is what we went out looking for so many years ago."
 flavor_krak.19.a:0 "Our winter paradise gets better and better!"
 flavor_krak.19.tooltip:0 "The §TIce-Field§! spell will be unlocked"
 flavor_krak.20.t:0 "Harnessing the Volcano"
 flavor_krak.20.d:0 "The first few attempts resulted in absolute chaos and catastrophe. The Ice-Magic rejected the magma, resulting in massive explosions of ice shards and magma and fire, or the spells fail, and it simply melts it all to sludge.\n\nThough the hold of Gor Bûrad is now even more blackened and dilapidated than before, they have made progress. Soon they had mastered safe and steady production and the Ice-Steel they were making was the strongest we have ever seen, finer even than the mithril-steel alloy we have been using in Mithradhûm!\n\nThere is still the issue of the travel time for shipping all this Ice-Steel from Gor Bûrad to Krakdhûmvror. Not to mention that production will not meet the standards of the Icecraft Hall for many, many years. We of course cannot move the volcano and its magma north or this would be much easier, simply integrating its new production methods with those we have already established in the Icecraft Hall. Perhaps the Ice-Smiths will find a way someday."
 flavor_krak.20.a:0 "This new stuff is really something."
 flavor_krak.21.t:0 "A Spark of Genius"
 flavor_krak.21.d:0 "On a clear night in one of the upper observatories of Dûr-Vazhatun, two Ice-Smiths were enjoying a night of stargazing and drinking when one spotted a comet falling to Halann. He realized by the colour of the tail and speed of it's descent that it must be damestear, and they marvelled briefly over how little size reduction it undergoes when hurtling through the atmosphere. So many other comets and such are usually seen to burn up very quickly, with very little remaining on impact. An hour or so and a few bottles later, the Ice-Smith jumped out of his chair, "We'll encase it in damestear!" he cried, and, grabbing his papers and drink, ran out of the observatory.\n\nHis plan, now refined through sobriety, is this: damestear is incredibly heat resistant. Initial tests with small amounts show that even when engulfed in magma it does not melt, though it will heat up to match the magma's temperature on the outside. If we were to create a great sphere of Ice-Steel and then encase it in a layer of damestear, they believe we can dip it down into the heart of the magma lake and let it absorb the heat energy contained there into the Ice-Steel. They will then use this heat to temper the Ice-Steel made in Krakdhûmvror and to power the furnaces there for decades to come!"
 flavor_krak.21.a:0 "I wonder if we'll have to recharge it?"
 flavor_krak.22.t:0 "The Third Expedition"
 flavor_krak.22.d:0 "Our Ice-Smiths have pinpointed the area that the magical disturbance came from during their casting of the great Northern Pass Ice-Field spell. With the Nortumrod complete and fully functional to maintain a constant supply chain to Fýllstýn, the Grim Legion acting as the vanguard of the expedition, dealing with threats, and navigating the cold frozen wastelands, and a proper heading, we are sure to succeed in finding whatever this mysterious magic is emanating from!"
 flavor_krak.22.a:0 "Once more with feeling!"
 flavor_krak.23.t:0 "Home of the Ancient Enemy"
 flavor_krak.23.d:0 "Our teams have found ancient ruins of an immense scale buried deep in the snow in the far northern parts of the Frozen Wastes. While some of them are too big to transport back, these ruins contain some interesting artifacts which we can bring with us, and we are having drawings and sculptures made of what we cannot. The very stones themselves seem to be what was creating the disturbance, reacting even now to the Ice-Smiths' magic.\n\nSuch grand and mysterious ruins could only have been made by our ancient enemies, the Ice Giants. This is what we have been trying to find. Perhaps this place saw the final days of their kind? Perhaps it is only one of several such sites even further north? We may never know."
 flavor_krak.23.a:0 "Incredible!"
 flavor_krak.24.t:0 "The Expedition Returns"
 flavor_krak.24.d:0 "Our expedition has returned victorious! They bring with them cartfuls of huge artifacts, clearly designed in scale for giants. Our teams scoured the routes on the way there and back and have found no other significant sources of magical disturbance, but there may yet be things hidden beneath the snows and glaciers of the far north. We will certainly not stop privately funded expeditions but our own will end here with this great victory!"
 flavor_krak.24.a:0 "Now, where to put all these new things? Perhaps they belong in a museum?"
 flavor_krak.25.t:0 "A Lucrative Offer"
 flavor_krak.25.d:0 "An off group of dwarves have approached us with an offer to buy a rather staggering amount of damestear for an even more staggering amount of money. They don't seem to be willing to take no for an offer, and quite frankly, we could use the gold. Besides, we have damestear to spare."
 flavor_krak.25.a:0 "Money is very nice after all."
 flavor_krak.26.t:0 "The Lava Gem"
 flavor_krak.26.d:0 "The apparatus is complete, and the orb has been cast and encased in damestear. It hangs on a thick damestear chain which is attached to a great winching system built high above the lake, on the chamber's ceiling. Thousands are gathered on the shores of the lake (with localized Ice Fields being maintained by the Ice-Smiths to keep people cool) or from the balconies of the hold itself, watching the great orb being lowered into the lake. As the damestear touches the magma it begins to glow softly but does not give way. As it submerges more and more, the glowing gets brighter until it is fully engulfed by the lake. The blue glow can still be seen getting softer and softer as it is lowered deeper.\n\nAfter an hour or so, the damestear chain begins to glow faintly, running up from the depths toward the winching station. That was to be the sign that it has absorbed all the heat it can. The great winches grind to life once more and lift the orb back out. The glow is so strong now that it can be seen long before it breaches the surface, and once it has, the light is so strong that most avert or shade their eyes from its intensity. The center is now glowing a steady, bright, and deep red while the damestear around it glows bright blue. The combined, sparkling, purple light it briefly produces is beautiful, looking like a star being pulled from some hellscape and will likely be the subject of many paintings in the coming years, before the damestear cools and ceases to glow. All that remains is the bright red orb in the center, the molten Ice-Steel as hot as the lake's heart. It is loaded into the armoured, reinforced train which has been prepared specially to carry this precious cargo, and the train takes off for Krakdhûmvror where the great Lava Gem as people are calling it, will be set up in the new facilities there."
 flavor_krak.26.a:0 "We have accomplished the impossible!"
 flavor_krak.27.t:0 "A Frozen Empire"
 flavor_krak.27.d:0 "The Everfrost Crown is finished. The band is made from Ice-Steel forged in Mithradhûm's mithril-steel alloy furnaces and it gleams with the bright shining silver that is so characteristic of mithril. Mountain patterns are embossed around the band in obsidian from the Ghelebûr Krakdhûm in Gor Bûrad, fused on during the forging of the band itself. On the top of each mountain peak sits a different stone, each the representation of the holds which now sit within our borders. At the front a taller mountain stands with a blizzard motif surrounding it and a large Ice Gem at its peak, glowing softly.\n\nThis crown is a masterwork of craftsdwarfship. May it now, and forever, sit atop the head of the quartz dwarves who lead our nation further and further down the road to greatness!"
 flavor_krak.27.a:0 "Let the Frozen Empire be as eternal as the ice and snow!"
 flavor_krak.28.t:0 "Citadel of Dark Ice"
 flavor_krak.28.d:0 "Aeons ago, when the orcs rampaged across the Dwarovar and Northern Pass, we held back the tide at the entrance of the Giant's Anvil. Kar Durghoir stood ever defiant against the waves of orcs, its Ice-Steel walls and gates outlasting generations of orcish warriors. It was only by some twisted turn of fate and a stray projectile from an orcish catapult that its mighty gates gave way. As the projectile hit and killed a group of our Ice-Smiths in the middle of their rituals, the great blocks of ice they were conjuring collapsed onto the gatehouse and greatly weakened the gates. Now, fate is on our side once again. Kar Durghoir has been rebuilt and it shall never again fall as long as a single Quartz Dwarf draws breath."
 flavor_krak.28.a:0 "Everything they have torn down, we shall build back up."

The people are spread thin, ill-supplied, and disunified by the constant change in government focus from one project to the next without ever finishing them or seeing them through. And now, our citizens are rising up in the streets of the holds and the farms on the surface, the mines and markets full of shouting voices and violence.\n\nAs though times were not hard enough, we have heard that the five clans are grumbling and moving their power about in the background of it all.

They only ask that we continue to do what is best for the hold. Many among us would happily see one of their clan rule us in the days to come, and the new head of the clan, Gundomar, son of Garlim would make a superb ruler.

It was the last stop for those sent or coming to our hold to hear news of the empire before crossing the valley to the Anvil. The old observatories and laboratories here still remain somewhat intact, as does most of the hold.\n\nIt seems as though it was too far east for any orcs or goblins to bother settling in its ruins and that seems to have spared the hold from any real infestation. We should reoccupy and rebuild this once-great hold to use as our forward base in pushing into the empire of old."
 krak_our_gateway_title:0 "Our Gateway"
 krak_our_gateway_desc:0 "The renovations of Dûr-Vazhatun are complete, and we have added some significant fortifications to the mountain entrance as well.

It is no easy task to move supplies about the Northern Pass, especially in the winter. Even the short gap of Tanning Valley becomes treacherous and slowgoing, which is part of what caused our initial colonization disaster in the Dagrinrod.\n\nWe need to establish a solid and secure road network that will be maintained all year round along its whole length, guaranteeing that our supplies get where they need to go, when they need to get there."

 krak_krakdhumrod_title:0 "The Krakdhûmrod"
 krak_krakdhumrod_desc:0 "With so much territory now inside the Serpentspine Mountains, we are having delays in our messages and supplies from backed up convoys in the Tanning Valley, waiting in great queues at the gates on either side for passage through. If we were to connect the Anvil to the Dagrinrod rail line we would be able to bypass that traffic backup and have people travel direct to Krakdhûmvror!"
 krak_fire_ice_title:0 "Fire and Ice"
 krak_fire_ice_desc:0 "Gor Bûrad was built inside a great volcano in the Serpentreach Mountains. The dwarves of Gor Bûrad were well known for using the magma and heat of the volcano in the Ghelebûr Krakdhûm, the Fireglass Forges. These forges produced obsidian and glass at staggering rates.\n\nThough its environment is the diametric opposite of what we live in, with its lake of magma and sweltering temperatures, we should, nonetheless, reclaim this powerful hold. Our Ice-Smiths have had a thought to use the magma in their Ice-Smithing, indeed they theorize that performing the forging in such heats might temper and strengthen the Ice-Steel.\n\nLet us just hope they know what they're doing, playing with a volcano!"

 krak_molten_core_title:0 "The Molten Core"
 krak_molten_core_desc:0 "Now that the Damestear has been secured, the second thing we will need is a massive supply of iron to make the Ice-Steel we will need. We will also need to dig enough new space in Gor Bûrad for the mechanisms and workshops required to make all this happen and we will need more room in Krakdhûmvror as well to house the final product and integrate it into our foundries and Ice-Crafting apparatuses.

But with the orcs having passed and the other dwarves reduced to surface adventurers or small remnants like us, our people wish to know what is going on outside our doors.\n\nOur council has had an idea. Krakdhûmvror has been growing lately and could use the extra space. Why not push into the tunnels to the south-west, towards the surface? We could reclaim the whole of the Anvil and establish a link to the surface for new resources and information."

 krak_surroundings_desc:0 "It has been so long since any Quartz Dwarf ventured outside the Giant's Anvil. We should send out some initial scouting parties into Tanning Valley and get the lay of the land. Then we must decide where best to send our teams to get a forward outpost up and running as soon as possible.\n\nWith all that complete, we will have a base from which we can mount further expeditions into the Northern Pass and beyond."
 krak_amldihr_title:0 "To Amldihr"
 krak_amldihr_desc:0 "The easiest route into Amldihr will likely be through the northern entrance in Serpent's Vale. With our push into the Northern Pass, we can easily move our efforts south to the Vale instead. We'll be in Amldihr in no time."

 krak_old_empire_desc:0 "Amldihr, the old capital of the Dwarven Empire, is under our control. Our scouts report no more signs of orcish or goblin control on the King's Rock.\n\nWith the old seat secured, we should push out and take over the Vale that surrounds the mountain.

 krak_frozen_wastes_desc:0 "The Quartz Dwarves have lived in the Giant's Anvil mountains for millenia, since the days of the Ice Giants. We are used to being the furthest northern point in the dwarven realms though there is much land further north than ours. No one that we have ever heard of, dwarf or otherwise, has tried to journey north into the frozen wastelands, fearing that giants and monsters and ancient evil magics rule there still.\n\nBut we know better. There have been no giants for hundreds of years. We shall act accordingly.\n\nLet us clear the lands in our northernmost holdings of threats so we can set up a base of operations for expeditions into the northern wastes. Even if the giants simply went there to die, there could be unknowable treasures waiting for us at their graves."

 krak_natural_element_desc:0 "The Ice-Smiths have come to us with an interesting proposal recently. They wish to have a research station set up in our arctic holdings to study their magics in its natural element. They believe, since our people are so used to the cold anyways, that we should encourage colonization of the region.\n\nThis will give the Ice-Smiths the opportunity to observe and test their magic in the field, and they have promised to dedicate some of their research to finding ways to help our colonies."
 krak_great_expedition_title:0 "The Great Expedition"
 krak_great_expedition_desc:0 "We have the infrastructure in place now to actually begin preparations for a great expedition north into the Frozen Wastes. Who knows if we might find the graves of the last frost giants? Perhaps there will just be yet more trolls, perhaps there will be something else we've never even thought to imagine. But one thing is certain: though the cold has kept most explorers back before, with our natural tolerance to it and our Ice-Smithing we will be able to withstand it and brave its deepest secretes."

They remain there still, our old enemies, fighting amongst the human remnants and various adventuring companies.\n\nIf we are to prevent them from getting back in, we must take Khugdihr hold, the westernmost entrance to the Dwarovar, and fortify its gates so that the orcs have no chance of breaking through!"
 krak_linking_lands_title:0 "Linking our Lands"
 krak_linking_lands_desc:0 "Our nation now encompasses four entrances to the Dwarovar, from Khugdihr in the west to Dûr-Vazhatun in the east. This is a great distance to travel either through or around the Dwarovar. Since we hold Er-Natvir, we ought to begin to restore the old rail networks in on the Dwarovrod and Dagrinrod to facilitate travel between our western and eastern mountain holdings."

 krak_seal_mountain_title:0 "Seal Off our Mountain"
 krak_seal_mountain_desc:0 "If we are to ensure our future, we must secure all the entrances to the Dwarovar and fortify them so that no one shall get in or out without our say so.\n\nThere are some that we have already sealed, such as the hold at Khugdihr, but there are several passages which lead into the Deepwoods, Arg-Tunad and Vazok-Tunad leading to other parts of the mountain, and supposedly a breach in the far eastern depths of the Nest.\n\nSoon we shall be the sole inhabitants of this part of the Serpentspine!"
 krak_not_rivals_title:0 "Not our Rivals"
 krak_not_rivals_desc:0 "Arg-Ôrdstun is considered the heart of the Serpentreach Mountains and often had the Reach rallied behind it in opposition of Amldihr. While they may have been heated, bitter contestants to the power in Amldihr long ago, the Diamond Dwarves are nothing compared to its current holders: us.\n\nThough they may not want to be part of our nation, they will be, as sure as an avalanche buries all before it. We must secure their hold and put their renowned diamonds and diamond cutting skills to use in the production of our Ice Gems. With the Ôrdstunic dwarves thoroughly under heel, our craft will become the stuff of legends!"

With the capital so far away, this will give us time to receive news from the front without losing any ground. The orcs chose to leave the mountains, now they must stay out!"

 krak_secure_loyalty_desc:0 "With the Bordûz-az-Stun over, we must reinstate confidence in the government amongst the significant estates and fulfil the promises we've made to them.\n\nWith so many changes of late and concessions being made so frequently, it will do good to solidify our relationships with those who backed us in the power struggle to ensure that they continue to back us through the early stages of post-reform."
 krak_quartz_title:0 "Not Kronium but Quartz"
 krak_quartz_desc:0 "Amldihr has always been considered the jewel of the Dwarovar. Under the guidance of the Kronium Dwarves, it was one of the deepest and most advanced holds in the empire.\n\nIt has fallen from such lofty heights from centuries of neglect and orcish occupation. We should renovate the great holds of the King's Rock and build them back up finer than they've ever been. Then all will know that it was the Quartz Dwarves, so long scoffed at in our northern 'prison', and not the long-dead Kronium Dwarves, that worked such wonders in the earth!"
 krak_vrorenstun_academy_title:0 "Vrorenstun Academy"
 krak_vrorenstun_academy_desc:0 "The Rite of Cold Iron has been a very effective tool for many years, but the actual tests themselves are becoming too backed up with applicants from our ever-growing nation. Perhaps it is time we move away from the old methods and set up a proper military academy, providing education and testing for any who pass the application exam. The talent will still flow into our armies and those who come will likely be a little better now for the general military schooling they will receive."
 krak_beasts_north_title:0 "Beasts of the North"
 krak_beasts_north_desc:0 "With a need to learn how to kill the beasts which roam the northern wastes and a growing need for good furs and meat, we could send hunting parties into the Hjýrtsikki forests to hunt and practice. This will bring in good revenue from the abundance of fur in the region and train our hunters for the eventual second expedition."
 krak_second_expedition_title:0 "Second Expedition"
 krak_second_expedition_desc:0 "The time has come to prepare supplies and funds for a second great expedition north.\n\nWe have better tools and equipment planned for the colder temperatures and our hunters have experience with the animals of the arctic from all our efforts in Hjýrtsikki. Plus, our veterans from last time remember what it was like and will lose less time to overcoming those initial obstacles."
 krak_nortumrod_title:0 "The Nortumrod"
 krak_nortumrod_desc:0 "With our recent investments into the Northern Pass region, we are having increasing troubles with backed up supplies, caravans, and ore deliveries. Travelling through the Pass is difficult at the best of times with its dense forests and rocky terrain, but in the winter it becomes almost impossible with all the snow.\n\nWe need to set up some kind of advanced road system to keep a clear, open, snow free path from the Lonely Mountain Mines and our expedition outpost to the Anvil's entrance."
 krak_great_fortress_title:0 "The Great Fortress"
 krak_great_fortress_desc:0 "Hul-Jorkad sits at the crossroads of the Dwarovar. The tunnels around it lead both east to the holds of the Segbandal and beyond towards the Earth Seed and to the Serpentreach mountains to the west while its surface gate opens to the scenic Jorkad Lake, long the home of the harpies of Firanya.\n\nWe should purge the hold of whatever filth has occupied it and restore it to its original glory.

Ovdal Lodhum, unfortunately, has declined from what it once was with its Tunnels of Love and its romantic glowstone traditions.\n\nWe should secure the hold, renovate it to return it to its former glory and then begin constructing the infrastructure we need to reopen the brothels and romance attractions and start thawing the hearts of the Quartz dwarves.\n\nAfter all, even people as cold as us still need love.

Our Ice-Smithing has become more powerful than our ancestors could have dreamed of and our goods are sought after by all of the world's wealthiest and most successful.\n\nTruly, it is the Quartz Dwarves, not the Kronium Dwarves, who were meant to lead dwarfkind forward into the future!
