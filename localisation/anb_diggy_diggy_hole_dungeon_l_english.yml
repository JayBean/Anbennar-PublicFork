#Frogarsalforn, library of the ancients
 dd_frogarsalforn: "Frôgarsalforn"
 diggy_dungeons.100.t:0 "A Hidden Library?"
 diggy_dungeons.100.d:0 "Our populace celebrates the return of our most recent expedition. They are being heralded as heroes and given a proper, heroic welcome. But behind closed doors, far away from the ears of the common people, the expedition leader tells our administration something else, something more.\n\nDuring the expedition they have uncovered more than just trinkets and treasures: A crack in the wall has led them to a room with old books and strange runes. All of dwarvish make.\n\nAfter some research, the council has decided what this must be: A remnant structure from the old days of Aul-Dwarov, a library where the ancient dwarves have accumulated their knowledge."
 diggy_dungeons.100.a:0 "It is Frôgarsalforn, the Ancient Library"

 diggy_dungeons.101.t:0 "Frôgarsalforn: The Ancient Library\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.101.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rubbled walls and falling stones give way to an old entrance room, overshadowed by its ancient air. Dust has settled on the old dwarven walls, their inscriptions hidden beneath a grey mass illuminated by faint torches. Slowly the expedition steps into these halls of antiquity, tiny bones crumble under the heavily armoured soldiers' boots.\n\n''This is the place," a sage explains. "This is Frôgarsalforn!"\n\nHe walks into the centre of the room, where the broken pieces of an orrery lie scattered across the floor. The base is covered in sticky webs of arachnid origin. These strands also extend beyond the room, covering up faint exits to the side. The grandest door, however, is not covered in webs, instead, it stands slightly ajar… "
 diggy_dungeons.101.a:0 "Clear the webs"
 diggy_dungeons.101.b:0 "Open the door"

 diggy_dungeons.102.t:0 "A Trove\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.102.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The passages with webs were cleared with no problems, the silvery-white strands now an amorphous mass on the ground. Hidden behind these once-homes lies the nest and breeding ground of the spiders. Gleaming among the remnants are old coins, gold and silver, as well as trinkets of dwarvish make, amulets and other, more exotic goods."
 diggy_dungeons.102.a:0 "Loot the webs"

 diggy_dungeons.103.t:0 "The Many-Legged Menace\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.103.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the webs jitter, their reverberations send signals to those who made them in the first place. From the passages spew forth the eight-legged monstrosities who now claim these hallways their home.\n\nAxe and blade against leg and mandible, the sudden fight overwhelmed the soldiers. Quickly they threw open the big door, hoping to find a safe haven deeper in the ancient structure."
 diggy_dungeons.103.a:0 "Get away!"

 diggy_dungeons.104.t:0 "The Reading Hall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.104.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rows upon rows of bookstands designate this room as the old reading hall of the library. It is not hard to imagine the dwarves of yore pondering their scrolls and stone tablets. In the centre of the room stands an effigy of erudition, a grand statue of a dwarf, book and scroll in his hands. The stone base is carved with runes.\n\n"All those who seek knowledge must know the ways to obtain it."\n\n"A classic dwarven riddle," one of the soldiers says. "It must have an answer hidden in this room."\n\nThe explorers dispersed immediately, looking through the old rafters for clues. Eventually, an elder adventurer steps forth. "A library is a key to knowledge. What must we do to use a key? We must turn the pedestal!" he says.\n\nOthers seem more suspicious of his theory. They claim that turning over the statue itself might be the better idea."
 diggy_dungeons.104.a:0 "Turn it over - down with the statue"
 diggy_dungeons.104.b:0 "Turn the pedestal"

 diggy_dungeons.105.t:0 "The Key To Knowledge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.105.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With rope and strength the statue keeled over, breaking loose from the base. As it fell to the ground, snapping noises echo through the room, followed by a low rumbling sound. The mechanism inside the statue had broken down, releasing the winch that held the hidden door in place.\n\nThe sound of bursting stone mixed with the creaking of stone sliding on stone as a door further into the library opened. Within the rubble, however, the explorers also found  some well-hidden gold. A thoroughly successful undertaking!"
 diggy_dungeons.105.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After considerable angular momentum was laid upon the statue it finally began to turn. Stone sliding on stone, groaning grains of particulate like flour seeping out of the joint, the mechanism inside the apparatus whirred to life. From within came the sound of a winch unwinding.\n\nSuddenly a hidden door on the other end of the room opened, effortlessly sliding open. In addition to that, a secret compartment within the statue itself opened, filled with gold."
 diggy_dungeons.105.a:0 "Good job, let's continue"

 diggy_dungeons.106.t:0 "Statue of Secrets\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.106.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As soon as the soldiers touched the statue it sprang to life, leaving its pedestal. It wielded the scroll akin to a sword, the book like a shield.\n\nThe soldiers were startled at first but caught themselves soon enough to mount a defence. The stone was old, however, and could not take much. The animated statue soon crumbled, but the magic power within burst in an arcane explosion, sending our forces  flying backwards."
 diggy_dungeons.106.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As soon as the soldiers touched the statue it sprang to life, leaving its pedestal. It wielded the scroll akin to a sword, the book like a shield.\n\nThe soldiers were startled at first but caught themselves soon enough to mount the defences.

 diggy_dungeons.106.a:0 "At least the door is open now…"

 diggy_dungeons.107.t:0 "At Knowledge's Core\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.107.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Now the expedition enters the main library. High arches bend in strange ways, fractals invoking a strange feeling of familiarity in the soldiers. The fluted ceiling reaches up far above, with rows and rows of bookshelves lining the ascent.\n\nMost of the exits from this room have long been buried under the ages, but two hallways are still passable. To one side lies the old bookbinder's workshop, while the other leads to the paper mill. It is now up to the expedition leader to decide where to go next."
 diggy_dungeons.107.a:0 "To the bookbinder"
 diggy_dungeons.107.b:0 "We should try the papermill"

 diggy_dungeons.108.t:0 "Milling Goblins\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.108.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The paper mill is dominated by the gigantic axle emerging from the water wheelworks beyond the stone. Attached to it are the hammers that used to stomp on linen and rags to make the pulp that would eventually become paper.\n\nThey no longer work, instead, they are infested with a band of goblins that live in every nook and cranny of this manufactory. As soon as our soldiers entered the room the monsters descended upon them, claw, teeth and shoddy blades against our superior armaments."
 diggy_dungeons.108.a:0 "We'll show them!"

 diggy_dungeons.109.t:0 "Binder's Folly\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.109.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The bookbinder's rooms are small and cramped, with many strange turns around the furniture. It does not help that every nook and cranny seems to be stuffed with a group of orcs that have made their home here.\n\nFighting starts breaking out the moment one of our men enters the room. The orcish ferocity strikes fear into our soldiers, but they fight bravely. For now…"
 diggy_dungeons.109.a:0 "Give them no quarter!"

 diggy_dungeons.110.t:0 "Battered and Beaten\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.110.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins overwhelmed us by sheer number alone. Like a hydra, if you cut one goblin down, two are ready to take its place. Slowly we were driven back into the corners of the room, some unlucky groups circled in. Screams and warcries intermingle as both sides take losses, but it is our side who takes the brunt, and casualties mount."
 diggy_dungeons.110.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The orcs plough through our ranks, weaponizing the old tools of the trade against us. They throw the discarded equipment and turn over tables, all in their devastating offensive. Soon the front is littered with corpses. There are more of our men lying there than orcs, however, and those brutish specimens still have much fighting spirit left."
 diggy_dungeons.110.a:0 "We need to salvage this"

 diggy_dungeons.111.t:0 "Victory!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.111.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins posed no great threat, their weapons too weak to harm our armour. Soon they fled through the cracks, leaving the room to us."
 diggy_dungeons.111.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their ferocious nature the orcs were unable to keep up their offensive, and before they could organize themselves we had already cut down a majority. The rest fled the halls, nowhere to be seen."
 diggy_dungeons.111.a:0 "Onwards!"

 diggy_dungeons.112.t:0 "Emergency System\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.112.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Old dwarven structures like these, located far away from other infrastructure, usually had automated defence mechanisms to repel invaders. During the disastrous battle, one such mechanism was discovered: An emergency offensive measure. But centuries have passed since its last maintenance. Will it still work?"
 diggy_dungeons.112.a:0 "It is our last option"
 diggy_dungeons.112.b:0 "We shouldn't risk it"

 diggy_dungeons.113.t:0 "The Return\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.113.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]When the first soldiers arrive back in the main room, they are startled by what they see. Our fighting must have alerted more and more enemies who now swarm the premises. All parts of the room are filled with our foes, all entrances blocked. We only have one choice left: Fight once again for our lives."
 diggy_dungeons.113.a:0 "One last stand"

 diggy_dungeons.114.t:0 "Aid of Yore\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.114.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The emergency system sprang to life, disgorging dwarven security automata upon our enemies. The whirling constructs cut deep swathes into our enemies and obliterated them, leaving us free reign over the region."
 diggy_dungeons.114.a:0 "Those dwarves knew what was up"

 diggy_dungeons.115.t:0 "Backfire\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.115.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The system was working -- but in the worst way possible. The automatons attacked everything in sight, even our men, reducing the entire room to rubble.\n\nSoon nothing was left except a single soldier that had been straggling behind, who now had the terrible task of reporting this failure to his superiors."
 diggy_dungeons.115.a:0 "What a terrible idea"

 diggy_dungeons.116.t:0 "Retreat\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.116.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Instead of risking the old dwarven mechanism, the expedition leader signalled a retreat. Quickly the troops gathered and made their way out of the library, leaving the rooms and treasures behind with heavy hearts.\n\nBack in the capital [Root.Monarch.GetName]was not impressed either but understood what had to be done. Now we tend to our wounded and plan for the next time."
 diggy_dungeons.116.a:0 "We'll try again next time"

 diggy_dungeons.117.t:0 "Corpses upon Corpses\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.117.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The last missive reaching the capital was that a fight had begun in the main hall. Then nothing. Diviners have tried to discern what had happened. Their result: Total annihilation. The expedition has failed."
 diggy_dungeons.117.a:0 "next time"

 diggy_dungeons.118.t:0 "Towards a Bright Future\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.118.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their superior numbers we have managed to kill enough of our enemies to scare them into fleeing. As the hall clears out we survey and try to salvage what we can. Many walls are now completely broken down, but that has also revealed more chambers that were previously inaccessible. There we found old records and treasure that were still mostly intact, a great success for our expedition!"
 diggy_dungeons.118.a:0 "Take what you can"

 diggy_dungeons.119.t:0 "Glorious Return\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.119.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition returns, treasure and knowledge in hand. They are heralded as heroes and share the tales of their experiences with the eager ears of our populace."
 diggy_dungeons.119.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 diggy_dungeons.120.t:0 "Beyond the Premises\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.120.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the main rooms of the library cleared out and in various states of repair, one of the construction crews reports of a break-in that revealed a zig-zagging chasm into the dark depths of the mountain. After some first inspections we were attacked by a small fighting force of goblins, armed with weapons of higher quality than initially expected. Quickly the defences were rallied so that construction would not be hindered.\n\nAfter some fighting the goblins were either killed or fled back into the dark, but the chasm clearly posed a serious security hazard. After much discussion the decision to send another expedition into the library was deemed reasonable, and a new force of explorers were sent out to brave its halls.\n\nArriving at the point of the break-in, the expedition leader reviews and takes stock of her men and  supplies. But even as this proceeded, screams could be heard from the dark below. Faint lights appeared in the depths, quickly drawing nearer. The soldiers readied their weapons against the approaching foe, readying a defense against a tunnel in the wall."
 diggy_dungeons.120.a:0 "We will stand united"

 diggy_dungeons.121.t:0 "The Sword is Stronger Than the Claw\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.121.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins arrived in manageable waves, trickling into the room in small groups. They were mostly disoriented and confused as to what exactly was happening. This meant that our soldiers had no trouble keeping the enemy at bay, although the waves got stronger towards the end. Then, as suddenly as they appeared, the goblins stopped coming through, leaving the path ahead clear."
 diggy_dungeons.121.a:0 "A great start to our endeavour"

 diggy_dungeons.122.t:0 "Broken Wall, Broken Shields\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.122.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins crashed through the hole in the wall in an unending tidal wave, goblin after goblin disgorging from the stone wound. Our soldiers were slowly and steadily driven back, each line of defence falling almost as soon as they were erected. Then, after a bloody back and forth, the goblins retreated back into the dark. The path is clear, but the price was high."
 diggy_dungeons.122.a:0 "Not the best start, but a start nonetheless"

 diggy_dungeons.123.t:0 "Gazing Into the Abyss\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.123.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The chasm stretches deep below, its yawning dark beckons those at the precipice. Some soldiers are uneasy already, mentioning some strange force numbing their senses.\n\nBut the expedition leader must determine how to best approach the chasm.\n\nQuickly two options stand out. The chasm has repeating platforms and terraces protruding from the walls, which could be secured and made walkable, adding safe waiting spots, but at a high cost to our supplies. The other possibility is to use winches from the library construction to rope the soldiers down one by one."
 diggy_dungeons.123.a:0 "Secure the platforms"
 diggy_dungeons.123.b:0 "Just rope down"

 diggy_dungeons.124.t:0 "The Way Down\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.124.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At first the plan with the ropes worked out. One by one the soldiers touched down on the floor of the chasm, but towards the end the winches began creaking under the constant strain, and the rope itself started degrading. Then, piece by piece, the mechanism broke, sending many men falling to their deaths, destroying supplies and other important equipment."
 diggy_dungeons.124.a:0 "It all comes crashing down"

 diggy_dungeons.125.t:0 "The Abyss Gazes Back\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.125.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The terraces proved to be too unstable to safely traverse. Rocks breaking loose left and right sent equipment flying into the unknown dark, with only the sound of shattering tools reaching us. Our pitons and ropes managed to catch our men, thankfully,  so that we did not lose any of our crew. Despite the havoc, we did  all reach steady ground again, able to go on."
 diggy_dungeons.125.a:0 "Salvage what we can and continue"

 diggy_dungeons.126.t:0 "Descension\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.126.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With pitons and rope, strong pickaxes and sturdy spikes we managed to get down through the chasm with no problem whatsoever. In fact our morale improved after that first encounter with the goblins. Songs were sung, it all felt more like a stroll through the mountain instead of a dangerous descent."
 diggy_dungeons.126.a:0 "The climbing gear was worth the money"

 diggy_dungeons.127.t:0 "The Horde\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.127.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Walking along the bottom of the chasm instilled a strange mood in the explorers. Often the scouts would see something in the pitch-black dark, only for it to be a false alarm. The sound of scurrying claws dragged across stone echoed through the walls. There was something in the dark, just no one knew where it was exactly.\n\nIt all happened so quickly. From one second to the other the goblins descended upon us. Flashing teeth and claws, discarded swords and broken shields in their hands, they attacked us before the scouts could sound the alarm."
 diggy_dungeons.127.a:0 "Fight for your lives!"

 diggy_dungeons.128.t:0 "Brought Low In the Dark\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.128.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their sudden appearance our soldiers quickly rallied around our banners. Fighting from those steady formations managed to repel most of the greenskins. Some managed to get through the defences nonetheless, but reinforcements from other parts of the battle could bolster the ranks again.\n\nAs the goblins lost their superiority in numbers they started retreating up the walls from whence they came. A quick survey of the damages showed that there had been some casualties, as expected, but overall the battle was a resounding victory."
 diggy_dungeons.128.a:0 "The path is clear"

 diggy_dungeons.129.t:0 "Decimation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.129.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Just as quickly as it began it ended. After decimating our troops the goblins retreated into the dark again, seemingly content with what damage they had caused. Our medics now tend now to the wounded that can still be helped, and the surgeons patch up whatever they can. Many have fallen, far too many, but going back now is no option."
 diggy_dungeons.129.a:0 "We must go on"

 diggy_dungeons.130.t:0 "A Warband In the Deep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.130.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The past days had been quiet and fruitful. The cartographers managed to map out most of the lower levels, and our prospectors had even found some promising veins of ore, although nothing major.\n\nBut this soon changed with the echo of orcish war cries. The explorers knew immediately what would happen: A warband was roaming the chasm, and scouts soon reported that they were swiftly closing in . Our forces quickly took defensive positions, and just in time, as with unparalleled ferocity the orcs soon descended upon us."
 diggy_dungeons.130.a:0 "We will prevail"

 diggy_dungeons.131.t:0 "An Eventual Triumph\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.131.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their ferocious nature, the orcs turned out to be not quite as dangerous as we had believed. The winding paths in this chasm meant that they could not attack in a full frontal assault and had to trickle into the battlefield. In the end the drawn-out battle ended in our favour, with the warband dispatched and destroyed."
 diggy_dungeons.131.a:0 "Very good"

 diggy_dungeons.132.t:0 "Overrun\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.132.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Charging into our defences from the front and from the sides, through hidden tunnels in the walls, the orcs rushed over us like a wave, cutting down everyone and everything in their path. Terrified screams of pain could be heard echoing from the walls, the gurgling of blood, and war cries of orcs.\n\nDespite our losses, we gave as good as we got, and eventually destroyed the warband -- but at a staggering price."
 diggy_dungeons.132.a:0 "A costly victory, but a victory nonetheless"

 diggy_dungeons.133.t:0 "The Underboss\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.133.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our expedition has arrived at the end of the chasm. Over the past days goblin presence has become stronger and stronger, with many skirmishes here and there.\n\nBut now they stand in front of a rackety wooden castle clearly brimming with goblins. Floor by floor they cut themselves through until they arrive at the central chambers. There a large goblin sits on a throne of bones, wearing a shoddy crown. The soldiers have not yet been noticed, and so there is the opportunity to defeat this monster with brains, not just with brawn."
 diggy_dungeons.133.a:0 "Make a trap"

 diggy_dungeons.134.t:0 "Incarceration\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.134.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The trap is set and the expedition waits in the shadows. Eventually, the Boss leans back in his throne when the rackety cage falls down on him. This was the sign for the soldiers to come in and attack their helpless foe. Soon, all that is left of the Boss is a corpse."
 diggy_dungeons.134.a:0 "May you rot down here"

 diggy_dungeons.135.t:0 "Unhidden\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.135.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]During the construction of the trap our troops were suddenly overwhelmed by a patrol of goblins who immediately sounded the alarm. Within seconds the Boss was alerted and threateningly flourished his club at us.\n\nHis face was filled with a strange mixture of hate and glee, his teeth yellow-red against his dark green skin. We must be defensive if we wish to survive this encounter."
 diggy_dungeons.135.a:0 "The best defence is a good offence! Charge!"

 diggy_dungeons.136.t:0 "Blood and Bile\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.136.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the end all it took was a single sword plunged deep into the Boss' throat. Like a fountain of fresh springwater, blood and bile spilled out of his body, his bloated skin sagging down into a puddle of fat."
 diggy_dungeons.136.a:0 "Disgusting."

 diggy_dungeons.137.t:0 "Terror in the Deep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.137.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Goblins pour out from the walls. The Boss' club quakes the earth. One by one our men are slain. In the end only I remain. I can still hear them searching for me. They get closer. I can see the fire of their torches. Here. They. Come."
 diggy_dungeons.137.a:0 "A terrible end"

 diggy_dungeons.138.t:0 "The Home Stretch\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.138.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the threat of the Boss dealt with we can declare the chasm to be safe again. As we return to the library, however, new ideas for security measures are being drafted. Most importantly: seal off the chasm. Soon construction workers put their strengths to use and start patching up the wall, hopefully without another problem…"

 diggy_dungeons.139.t:0 "A Safe and Sound Wall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.139.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the wall sturdy and the chasm sealed off the library is once again safe from outside harm. The soldiers and construction workers rejoice and celebrate their successful journey into the depths and back up with drink and merriment. Even the expedition leader joins in on the celebration, as do the workers and foremen."
 diggy_dungeons.139.a:0 "Good job, everyone"

 diggy_dungeons.140.t:0 "Just One More Time\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.140.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Just as construction began on the wall, one last swarm of goblins came out from the chasm below. Their shrieking was made up from threats of vengeance and promises of death. They fought recklessly, until the very last one dropped dead.

 diggy_dungeons.142.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]For the past months, construction work had been going swimmingly and many parts of the library could be used by our scholars already. The workers laboured on their periphery, fixing things up here and there. Recently, however, some scribes have reported strange noises near one of the lower floors. The initial investigation had gone nowhere with the inspector saying nothing was there.\n\nComplaints did not end, however. Over the next weeks, more and more people complained about noises and even missing books. At this point, the chief librarian had heard enough. Clearly, something was amiss, and he called for a new expedition into the library.\n\nWith the force assembled the expedition leader took stock of the situation. Together with a few scouts he surveyed the perimeter and a particularly perceptive peer provoked peculiar proceedings: Behind one of the shelves could be heard the rattles of a door swinging in a draft. He pushed the shelf aside, revealing an entrance into a deeper part of the library. From the dark corridor, the sound of wood bumping against wood echoes out."

 diggy_dungeons.145.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the door safely barricaded no one can get through, and the passage should be safe to any intruders. This means, however, that in order to follow up on the strange occurrences the expedition has to find another path.\n\nAfter some time one of the scouts returned with great news: she has found another way into the deeper library! Not only that but this path must have been dug by a xorn or a similarly creature with corvidian instincts: gems and gold were laid in hoard just a few minutes walk into the tunnel."

Large limestone deposits hung menacingly above heaps and heaps of gold coins, minted all those ages ago in Aul-Dwarov. They bear the likeness of those dwarf-lords of old and there still is a glint in their age-wizened eyes.\n\nMeanwhile the eyes of our soldiers seem to be not wise at all. Their joy about this grand discovery soon turned into a lust for the riches. All over the cavern people started divvying up the gold -- despite the expedition charter specifically saying that all loot would go into the coffers, not to the individual soldier."

As he descended upon the group of infighters he bludgeoned his way towards the coins, escalating the discussions into a full-blown fight.\n\nEventually the fighting stopped as the grim realisation set in what had happened. A senseless massacre that, in the end, benefitted absolutely no one. As the explorers settle down for the night there is a long silence in the camp. Those who fought were shunned by those who had resisted the urge, creating a dark emotional barrier within the camp. In the end it was decided that this gold should be left alone, that it would be too dangerous to bring it back."

Soldiers would start babbling nonsensical stuff, quoting entire passages of books they had read once, or maybe never read at all. Some would start drawing maps of strange places, reciting poetry or arcane formulas. Then, there would be quiet for some time, then there would be outbursts again.\n\nAfter the third time a soldier quoted from "Lugnut's Treatise on the Strange Rumorations of What Lies Beyond the House of the Riddling Sun of Rubaa and How Kitling Would Not Recognize Her Mother" the expedition leader had enough. He called a large meeting to discuss what was going on.\n\nAfter some lively discussion (and one of the lieutenants telling the story of some elf in Cannor nobody had ever heard of) there was a consensus. They were haunted not by a ghost, but by a much stranger enemy: A knowledge elemental. Memory made real. But how would one even fight such an apparition?"

We hold on to the ropes, bracing for impact. Some lose grip and fall. We painfully clash with a rockwall bruising some arms and backs. No time to catch breath.

Confusion suddenly leads to disaster. Against warnings, some of our companions break their formation to help the trapped. This proves to be a big mistake, as they rapidly get surrounded by the enemy. To end this and avoid losing more men, we charge the goblins. We struggle as we clash with them. Some of them fall dead as well as some of us. Many minutes that feel eternal passes until the remaining goblins retreat to small holes around. We take this opportunity. We flee forwards, leaving the rocky chamber and our deceased behind."

An strong intoxicating odor -similar to the allure of one's partner's sweaty body- permeates the air. Serene silver-chimes notes echo; Then bronze-like trumpets join; Rusty metal flutes in lesser frequency. We realize that is the sound of bugs here.

The "ores" struggle to fit in the entrance as they growl in pure animal rage. They enter one by one, throwing us heavy blows. With endurance and patience, we block and find openings to strike them with pickaxes and hammers. And so one by one, we turn them into piles of pebbles. Sweating and hot blooded we look around.

A couple of explorers express a proposal. They ask the whole expedition to back off a bit. We take a bigger distance from the crabs. The explorers select the baits. They crouch like crabs, trying to set the creatures at ease. Little by little, they slowly and carefully approach the creatures with light crouching steps. Once close enough, they hold the baits on the ground. A crab un-shelters and gets slowly closer…. Another one follows. Then a good number of them. As they approach, the explorers take the bait a bit far away. The crabs follow and the bait gets farther. The whole group is chasing after the baits now. The once obstructed passage is clearer now. The expedition moves quickly to take advantage of the opportunity, laughing and cheering as they go. The explorers are the last to follow… and they come with a couple of newly made friends!"

 diggy_dungeons.331.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We are greeted by a burnt and rotten odor. Bone garlands hang from the ceiling. Blood paintings decorate the walls. A perceptual individual of us notices a familiar smell note from the campfire's ashes. He looks around to examine the wall decorations. He slowly wanders the cave. Crouches and removes a big rock. From the uncovered site he retrieves dusty old parchments and odd jeweled amulets."

 diggy_dungeons.333.t:0 "Into The Mist\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.333.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We row against the swells. The first ones just make the raft shake. The warm mist gets hotter. Around the fourth wave we clash against something… odd. A soft scaly turquoise bulge, which disappears under the surface the instant we make contact with it. In grim anticipation, we feel it scrape under the side of the raft. In just a couple of seconds, a long necked frog-like head emerges upon the larboard. At the same time, turquoise scaled hands claw onto the ship's borders. Its brown fat lower jaw opens, and a hot and suffocating flow of mist falls upon us."
 diggy_dungeons.333.a:0 "Get the spears now!"

 diggy_dungeons.334.t:0 "Survival Of The Fittest\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.334.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The mist still obscures our sight, and many of the spears are thrown uselessly into the water. A claw tears down an expeditionary along with a small part of the boat. The same instant, the beast extends its head to devour another. Screams and blood are splashed. With the beast's head so close, a spearman stabs it in one eye. Angered, the monster shakes the boat with its tail from the starboard, crushing two expeditionaries. We stab the tail until it bleeds, attempting to get out of the creature's grasp. Finally, it appears to give up. It launches the raft with its tail to get a distance away from us, and swims away.  Finally, we get out of the mist. That was a horrible experience, but at least most of us are alive."
 diggy_dungeons.334.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our shieldwall tries to clash them, but they scatter around the island, throwing spears as they retreat. As we pursue the retreating goblins, our formation breaks, allowing many of the goblins' throwing spears to find targets. In return, many of the goblins are chased down and slain. As the skirmish continues, however, a strange fog envelops the island. . Scattered and exhausted, we look on in horror as a long necked turquoise scaled beast, with a brown belly and throat, emerges from the water. Mist spews from its throat and engulfs the island. In the ensuing chaos, it quickly devours some goblins and expeditioners. We immediately give the order to retreat to our raft, hoping to escape while it is busy eating our enemies."

 diggy_dungeons.335.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]"Miners, tie ropes to your pickaxes!" yells the captain. They act quickly. Other members distract the creature by throwing spears at it, but to no avail. The mist still obscures much of their target. A claw tears down a man along with a small part of the boat. The same instant, the beast extends its head to devour another. Screams and blood are splashed. With the beast's head so close, a spearman stabs it in one eye. Angered, the monster shakes the boat with its tail from the starboard, crushing two of the expeditionaries. The miners are ready. The captain orders to throw the picks and harpoon the beast and its tail. It works! Even if some picks fall to water, with those ropes they still get attached to the monster. Now everyone is pulling the ropes. Our blood pumps as our faces redden. The animal is now encrusted like a hunted whale to the boat. The captain, with his unsheathed sword, cutthroats the long neck. The beast's struggle lessens. As it dies, the captain opens its stomach. The turquoise water turns crimson, but some large shiny pearls float to the surface."
 diggy_dungeons.335.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our shieldwall clashes them. Our numbers are greater, easily flanking and surrounding them. Trapped inside a spear circle, they struggle uselessly to survive. In a matter of moments, all goblins lie dead, their blood flows to the tiny island's shores. We loot their camp and leave."

 diggy_dungeons.336.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition follows the march by the shore. The once still waters become more agitated. After some walking we see how it runs faster until a portion of the lake becomes a violent river flowing downwards. We keep following this flow. Then, a big shock. Before reaching the descending level, we find a pair of six foot large footprints… The footprints can be seen going down by the same shore we plan to walk. It is difficult to see where they lead as darkness engulfs the path"

 diggy_dungeons.338.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Those slippery bastards! Although we managed to kill some, another portion of them overpowered and cutted two mates. We rush to save them. Although we killed the crabs, our mates are just corpses by now. Some small crabs even get out of their bleedings. Anyway, the shore passage is clear."
 diggy_dungeons.338.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Before we even react, the orc reaches two of our mates, crushing their skulls. As blood splatters, we answer by impaling the orc with spears. We mourn our fallen. However, we must keep going. With sad steps we go to the shore."

 diggy_dungeons.339.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we advance, things get darker. Only crystals shine now, no more shrooms glowing. We keep rowing as we initially did: with strength enough to traverse these still waters. But suddenly we start to move faster. It is at first barely noticeable, and we do not realize what is happening until it is too late.. The expeditionaries soon stop rowing, as they realize the water itself pulls us along even faster than we were going before.. The torch light illuminates a bunch of large rocks and a sudden cascade we are about to fall in."

 diggy_dungeons.340.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The "waterfall" was just a slope, but the relief does not last long. Violent water splashes reach the crew from all sides. A few torchlights extinguish. Some oars break on the rapid's rocks. Unable to coordinate our movements, we speed up further. More rocks clash with us, tearing up the out of control raft. Finally, we come to a stop in a load crash. We slowly get up from the pain. We landed into a pool on a large circular metal platform, just at the rapids' end. We look around for survivors. Three who did not get up are indeed dead, the other four are just wounded. Luckily most of us are well."
 diggy_dungeons.340.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After two hours of rest, the scouts have not returned. We keep on waiting. Our rest turns into uncertainty and worry as hours pass. We can not wait any longer. The captain commands us into following the dark shore. It is a slippery and unsteady march, which makes it slower. It is stressful to keep raising those who fall and to not fall with them. Did the scouts fall into the river? Seems unlikely. Did something eat them? I do not want to think about it. Anyway, five good scouts lost."
 diggy_dungeons.340.a:0 "Let us keep going, then."

 diggy_dungeons.341.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After two hours of rest, the scouts are back. "Captain! the tracks through the shore lead to a strange metallic construction". He pauses to organize his thoughts. "However, what I suppose to be the entrance is blocked by a fish nest". "A fish nest?" We inquire. "You would not believe it". He takes a deep breath. "There is a… big legged fish". He then explains more about its measurements and the terrain down there."
 diggy_dungeons.341.a:0 "Interesting. I have an idea."

Some oars break on the rapid's rocks. But we remain focused through this adversity. Determined and organized we row with as much grace as the situation allows for. We manage to control our track and speed. Sweaty and panting, we finally arrive at the shore. The flow turns into a pool on a large circular metal platform. In front of us there is… something weirder."

 diggy_dungeons.343.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we follow the shore, the cave's roof crystals sparkle with great intensity. Their shine reflects in both water and the metal underneath. Once more, the light of our torches has become superfluous. A thick and tall metal gate threshold is revealed under this light. Blocking it, there is a large nest made of rocks and mushrooms. Many multicolored eggs of at least five feet tall rest on top of it. From behind the nest, something pink peeks out. It is a big wide head with dark lidless eyes staring at us. It bears a smile as wide as its head, lined on both sides by stringy gills. It slowly gets up, revealing a gigantic light pink body of four legs and a tail. It keeps staring and smiling at us… A second later, it is charging towards us!"

 diggy_dungeons.344.t:0 "So Quick!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.344.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In an instant, the pink fish comes running, splashing water everywhere as it makes floor tremble. "March back to the shore!" yells the captain. But before we could turn around, a water splash reaches and our vision soaks. We stand our ground, bracing our spears. Able to see again, we se a chunk of meat sweeping our first lines. It got stabbed by some spears, however, it just makes it angrier. The fish starts stomping those who fell down. We send another line to stab the thing, but It quickly notices it. Hastily jumps, tramples our companions and engulfs one of them. Just one third of the expedition remains. "Retreat!" demands our captain. We run up the shore with him. However, the beast is quicker and tackles us all. As I lay on the ground, I can feel how it cracks my mate's bodies with its feet. I cannot feel my legs and my head burns. I hear the captain crying for help. His cries get weaker over time as my vision blurs. The last thing I see is how beautiful the crystals keep sparkling. The shine gets fainter with each passing second…" 
 diggy_dungeons.344.a:0 "I should have stayed at home."

 diggy_dungeons.345.t:0 "Brilliant Strategist\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.345.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We only have seconds to react. "At my signal, split to the sides" instructs our captain. The pink fish runs splashing water everywhere. The floor trembles. A water splash is about to reach us. "Split!" yells our captain. We do. Everything gets water-blurry. We heard an otherworldly cry and a familiar struggling voice at the same time. The voice repeats itself "Shoot the damn spears!". Recovering our sights, we throw the spears. As they fly, the beast shakes its neck in pain. The captain is nailed to the fish's chest, embracing his spear, little below its throat. The spears land on many bits of the creature's flesh. It cries in pain as frantically whips its tail. It sweeps some of us. The fish starts running. It tramples over some men. The captain -still hanging to the creature- starts stabbing the neck with his sword. We see the creature trying to run back to its nest. But it falls down to its belly. The turquoise water gets purple as blood gushes from the beast."

 diggy_dungeons.346.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We recover and treat our few wounded. Others retrieve the captain's crushed body from the pink corpse's underneath. Our scouts inspect the area. Bronze vases and decorations are found inside the nest. The eggs are still warm. The gate is the threshold to copperish downstairs, just below the nest. We should explore the structure. We believe the captain would have desired it so." 
 diggy_dungeons.346.a:0 "But first, let us rest a little."

 diggy_dungeons.347.t:0 "Hand-made\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.347.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With a couple of days passed, we are finally recuperated. We break camp, and prepare to move down the copper staircase.  Careful footsteps mark the stairs' descent. Not to maintain silence, but to make the noise more bearable. Some of the coppers steps of the stairway bend and give way as expeditioners stand on them, adding to the cacophony. Thunders resound through the surrounding rock walls. A short track made long by noise. The expedition finally reaches a small chamber at the end of the staircase, relieved to be rid of the overwhelming sound. It is surrounded by bronze "decorations" attached to rock walls. Two harmonic arches emerge by its sides."

 diggy_dungeons.348.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We pass a square hallway. Turning left there is a rusty metal door, which screeches as we open it. It appears to be a fairly sizable sleeping quarter, with three rock beds, one big adult-sized and two child-sized. Blankets and pillows are still in their places. Suddenly, as we search the room, someone screams. Startled, we look around for the source of the noise, which appears to be an oddly shaped skull. Its sockets glow blue, and it moves erratically on the table where it is placed, making awful noises. We can not understand a word and its movements are awfully stressful." 
 diggy_dungeons.348.a:0 "Everyone stay calm, please."

 diggy_dungeons.349.t:0 "Old Mess\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.349.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]An arched entrance greets us. Silverware lies scattered on the floor, between shards of broken clayware.

 diggy_dungeons.350.t:0 "Curiosity\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.350.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition manages to remain calm. Although it is bothersome and disruptive. A brave member catches the skull. It does not stop moving its jaws. Our companion examines it through the chaos. She looks underneath it. Enters his fingers. We look in awe and worry. With a struggling expression, she retrieves a shiny gem out of the skull. Satisfied, she shows us the inside of the skull: copper wires and gears"

 diggy_dungeons.351.t:0 "Fear\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.351.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In desperation, one of us jumps ahead. Screaming, he strikes the skull with his hammer. Bam! A small explosion resounds. Next, an awful burning smell disgusts us. At least the horrible voice is no more. The skull is reduced to shards of bone and dust, but oddly enough there is a strange liquid melting from the remains."

 diggy_dungeons.353.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Aside from the mess and the rot, we found curious remains: Perfectly clean-cutted bones; Old gray hair; And -the oddest of all- iridescent dry scales. The scales are more quirky than that. When put on different angles and lights, they seem to adopt certain colors of the environment… sometimes becoming invisible to the eye. Although they are quite old, maybe an animal must have dropped them long ago…."

As we advance through the chamber, the number of bones only multiplies until we find an ample gate. Is iron-made with multiple dents. Underneath it, there are a few kobold skeletons trapped. Some skulls are intact, the other bones are all crushed. The expedition unsuccessfully tries to smash the gate. It seems to be very thick. Whoever created it, made a crank -broken as for now- as the only way to open it. We could fix the crank… or blow the thing up."

Other crew members are affected too. One is on fire, another lost an arm and another one is bleeding a lot from her face. We grab and treat the wounded. Once the discord ends, we notice how a hole in the gate was made by the explosion. A larger chamber is seen to the other side. Crouching a little we can still pass through it."

The iron gate is gone. Now the passage to a much larger chamber is clear."
 diggy_dungeons.359.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our artisans start inspecting the crank and its mechanism. They test things out patiently. Even after seemingly having fixed it, they believe something more must be done. They point out some chains that hold the gate's mechanism.

We must get out and try it again after many hours."
 diggy_dungeons.360.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rusty tools, metal wheels, screws and nuts. Nothing new. Broken earthenware crafts follow in majority. Hope for profit seems lost.

As we shine light into the box, we are greeted by an array of lights shining back at us. Jewels! Sapphires, rubies, malachites, garnets, amethyst and even a bit of gold. Brute, cut, polished, it does not matter, we make space for them in our bags. We should get out before we run out of torches."

A strange bone and matter pile is a little past the center. Then we notice how the room's end is a bit… rocky. There are tons of loose bricks where the brick and mortar seems to simply transition into a cave wall. There are metal workbenches, anvils, a lot of processed metals and ores. There even is a smelter! This should have been a glorious home-forge once. Old glory, now covered in filth and dust. The inhabitants were indeed dedicated people. A shame to see all their effort dead. Leaving the awe behind, we step further… A string-like sound tips our ears. Some members trip and fall to the ground.

 diggy_dungeons.366.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The net traps the fallen members. Our front line tries to release them, but the trap appears to have been designed to account for this. Sharp wires rise quickly from underneath, slashing open their arms and heads. For those trapped it is worse. The metal wires envelop them through their skiing and flesh. They gruesomely scream in utmost pain. As they struggle, the wires' length thrust deeper in them until their body parts are severed. After several agonizing seconds, they stop screaming. The amputees moan kneeling as they bleed out of their arms. Everything smells like iron, like blood. We move quickly to tend to the wounded, cauterizing the open wounds and trying to stem the bleeding. In such discord, we notice too late a big hole from the room's end. A large "scissor" head bug struggles to get half of its body out of it."

 diggy_dungeons.367.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We take our time to inspect the sprung trap. It was really masterworkly done - as all the instruments found in this forge too - and we quickly realize how it works, we could even re-arm it. Some inspect the oven, smelter, anvils and tools out of fascination, others approach the bones and pile of matter. It smells like a buther's workshop, but only when we are close to it close to it. How is it possible to limit therange to which the odour extends? We inch closer. The pile is covered in a thick transparent slime. A brave soldier attempts to touch it, his hand is quickly stopped by something sticky and invisible above the pile. He tries to push it aside but his hand meets even more resistance. Whatever it is, it moved slightly. It shines, the shine runs through what was the strange resistance. Under the goo are scaly iridescent eggs. They are quite large, two and half feet long. Suddenly, from a big hole in the room's end we see a scissor coming out. Then a head struggles to get out. It is an glinting, ugly bug with a massive scissor maw - longer than a broadsword. This beast must be the one to cut all those bones so perfectly and leave these odd scales. It notices us, it screeches and struggles to get out quickly." 
 diggy_dungeons.367.a:0 "Let us kill it before it gets out of the hole!"
 diggy_dungeons.367.b:0 "Quick! Re-arm the trap!"

 diggy_dungeons.368.t:0 "Scissors!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.368.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The hole breaks. Stones falls out. We could not even manage to approach the bug, so quickly it left its burrow. It lands on six long legs, it's broadsword-long maw turned towards us. Then one of our expedition moves ever so slightly, which elicits a rapid answer with deafening screeches as its scales shine. Then, it disappears. Despite that we stand our ground, frightened to the very bone. Less than two seconds pass, and suddenly a crew member gets split in half by the bug's large teeths. With that the bug disappears again, leaving no time to react. This same procedure repeats itself, but now we can see a trail of red blood dripping. We know where it is and where it is going. We attempt to regroup but the bug tries to ambush us, springing forth from the darkness once again. We block the bite with a metal shield, staggering the beast, but the shield was almost cut in twain"
 diggy_dungeons.368.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The trap is quickly re-armed, the mechanism is intuitive. We just had to use our fishing net and change the trigger string's position. Then, the rockwall hole breaks, stones come falling down. The bug lands on its six long legs, but by that time we are already behind the trap. The iridescent bug's scales shine and it suddenly becomes invisible. It steps on the trap.\n\nIt all happens in seconds. The net falls. The bug struggles. The metal wires rise up. When they are about to lash the monster, it manages to free itself, but not entirely. Some wires reach the bug's lower body and some legs, stripping them from it. The bug screeches. Surprisingly, it is still surviving and moving quickly, befor it becomes invisible again. It is already dripping a lot of white blood, we know from where it will approach us. We stand in formation and await the attack."
 diggy_dungeons.368.a:0 "Time to end it!"

 diggy_dungeons.369.t:0 "Tough Guy\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.369.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The scissor bug quickly jumps to bite us. We block with a tall metal shield. Before the bug's maws slip and it flinches, some men at the sides grab its legs. The bug awfully shrieks as its legs are pulled, the shield pushes the bug to the opposite direction. It can only bite back the metal, its long fangs are bending the shield's sides. The ones who hold its legs hurry to cut them with knives like hard ropes. A long, sweaty and intense struggle begins. The men are red-faced when they cut all its six legs off. The bug is legless on its back now, it uselessly becomes invisible again. Before it tries to move we crowd-stab its thorax with spears and pickaxes. Despite the wounds, the beast struggles and bites back. It only manages to cut down a few spears. We just keep stabbing. Finally we managed to nail it to the ground through a steel spear. It still lives, but flails around like a helpless bug using its last strength. It is nailed and without strength to lift its head and bite."
 diggy_dungeons.369.a:0 "A fight worthy of legends."

 diggy_dungeons.370.t:0 "A Bloody Mess\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.370.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We prepare the tall metal shield. The scissor bug quickly jumps to bite us. We block. The beast lands on the shield. As we rise it upwards, our men on the sides extend their weapons to stab the bug. The weapon's point makes the creature jump. Its hind legs touch a wall and bounces back to us. This time, higher than the first. We raise spears to stab it as it falls. Useless, it is landing on swoop. Its hard as steel maws deflect the spears. It falls over us, cutting many heads and trampling a few members. Some manage to stab its loin. But that does not stop it. The insect keeps cutting. Legs, arms, full torsos and heads. Everyones is bleeding out. Its head was even stabbed a couple of times. Our numbers keeps dropping. I fall. My leg burns. I hear screams behind me. I raise my head to look at my body. My fear is confirmed: The damn thing cut off my right leg. I do not want to die like this… I crawl with all my strength! I need to get to the hallways, maybe there I can lose the bug. I hear screams ahead of me. My blood pumps heavily. I keep crawling. The bug is coming from the antechamber. It looks at me. From its inner mouth drops a head. The insect bites my shoulder the moment it reaches me, and starts dragging me back to its nest. I uselessly struggle. I ready myself to face a quick death like my mates… But when the bug places me on the nest it does not use its scissors. It raises them and with its inner mouth starts to bite and mangle me."  
 diggy_dungeons.370.a:0 "Please, make it stop!"

 diggy_dungeons.371.t:0 "That Is All\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.371.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The hole in the wall was closed, we do not want more of those bugs coming out. At last we may rest. Some are trying to figure out how to transport those large eggs. A possible solution would be raising the bugs. Of course it sounds profitable training and selling killing machines like that. Then they comment about the pink fish eggs too.\n\nBut what about this place? With the proper care and a good extension, it would be an amazing underground keep. Anyway, we should rest. In the next few days we will have a long journey back home. Our expedition's deeds will be remembered for long up there."
 diggy_dungeons.371.a:0 "Time to rest."

 diggy_dungeons.400.d:0 "An ancient geothermal power facility dating back to the days of Aul-Dwarov, the famed Dimlherd of the Dwarovar has been rumored to lay beneath our very feet. Lacking concrete maps or logistics, sending a party of adventurers to explore the region would be a fool's errand. Yet it seems that we are indeed fools. The caverns below are an area of particularly dense volacanic activity, known for active lava flows, fiery geysers, and all manner of ghastly horrors native to the Serpenspine. Yet we must persist, for the glory awaiting us at the end of this trek shall be worth the many lives it will take to grasp it."
 diggy_dungeons.400.a:0 "Let's start exploring!"

 diggy_dungeons.401.t:0 "The Expedition Begins\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.401.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we descend into the dark depths, the path to the fabled facility forks, revealing two ways forward. A stream of molten lava scattered with remnants of piping dictates that the most direct path is along its banks. Yet the older and wiser among the adventuring band caution the captain to choose the safer and longer path alongside the ravine's ridge, where a narrow pass can be seen."
 diggy_dungeons.401.a:0 "Follow the lava stream."
 diggy_dungeons.401.b:0 "Take the safer path."

 diggy_dungeons.402.t:0 "Lava Tides\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.402.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At first, it was a mere rumbling sound in the distance. But as it drew nearer, it became clear that the stream we had been following along would soon rise, with splotches of molten rock already covering the path to our backs. Soon enough, the rocky pathway will flood in its entirety, and if nothing is done, we will soon rest beneath the glowing waves."
 diggy_dungeons.402.a:0 "Seek higher ground!"

 diggy_dungeons.403.t:0 "The Ridge Pass\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.403.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The closer we got to the secondary path, the clearer it became that we were mistaken. There would be no safety nor quarter. The ridge offered very little in the way of freedom of movement, precariously suspended over the ravine, with the stream of lava within clear view, a constant reminder of what would come to those unable to find their footing."
 diggy_dungeons.403.a:0 "This is insane. Let's just follow the river."
 diggy_dungeons.403.b:0 "Following along the path *carefully*."

 diggy_dungeons.404.t:0 "The Floor is Lava\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.404.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the rocky cliffs began to crumble away and many men tumbled into the lava below, those that remained could only spare a fraction of a second to process the devastating loss of their comrades. There would be no solace in grief, for as quickly as the tides enveloped the thin pass, it receded, leaving not even bones behind."
 diggy_dungeons.404.a:0 "Nature is a fickle thing."

 diggy_dungeons.405.t:0 "Burned Toes\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.405.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the great rumbling subsided and the panic died down, it quickly became clear that we had gotten lucky. A false alarm. Or rather, a tide far less severe than originally anticipated. For if the scouts had been correct, there would be no men to continue the expedition."
 diggy_dungeons.405.a:0 "Rejoice, for we have been spared."

 diggy_dungeons.406.t:0 "An Unwilling Swim\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.406.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]No amount of caution could spare the party from the horrid fate that would soon follow. Walls crumbling as the ridge cleaved itself in two amidst tremors, depositing many of our comrades and pack animals into the lavaflow below."

 diggy_dungeons.408.t:0 "The Slumbering Naga\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.408.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Of the many sights to be seen beneath the surface, few are as rare as the naga. A serpent with the face of a woman, these crafty spellcasters can make quick work of an adventuring party, using strategy and cunning to outmaneuver greater enemies. Slumped over a dilapidated turbine is one of these rarities, adorned with charcoal-black scales and lighting snoring with a satisfied grin. Fortune appears to remain with us."

 diggy_dungeons.409.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Standing before the expedition is an ancient dwarven outpost, clearly a remnant from before the Final Days. Boasting a sturdy door and several deactivated turrets, the contents of the building would probably still be untouched."
 diggy_dungeons.409.a:0 "Break the door down!"

 diggy_dungeons.410.t:0 "Stirred from Sleep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.410.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the naga slowly rises from its slumber, a bit of sage wisdom runs through the captain's mind. Dark nagas, identifiable by their ebony scales, are known mind-readers. Whilst the expedition's footsteps were quiet, the racing minds of so many adventurers was enough to alert the enemy."
 diggy_dungeons.410.a:0 "Wait, why hasn't it attacked yet?"

 diggy_dungeons.411.t:0 "Flayed Serpent\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"

 diggy_dungeons.412.t:0 "Acidic Blood\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.412.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The slaughter was swift, and the spoils wonderful. The serpent was flayed with due haste, with its meat mixed into our food stores. All seemed right in the world, until our men began dropping like flied. One, two, then a dozen more. Panic ensued, until the cause became known to all. Nagas possess acidic blood, deadly to ingest. Worse than that, it appears as though a large portion of the food stock has been contaminated."

 diggy_dungeons.413.t:0 "Mission Improbable\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.413.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The naga's light slumber was clearly far deeper than it seemed. As the anxiety-riddled adventurers attempted to sneak past, a great clanging sound ensued as a clumsy paladin's shield clattered to the ground, the bone-chilling sound echoing throughout the ravine. Yet the naga did not stir."
 diggy_dungeons.413.a:0 "We need to have a conversation about proper fastenings."

 diggy_dungeons.414.t:0 "Explosives, my Beloved\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"

 diggy_dungeons.416.t:0 "The Naga's Offer\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.416.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the beast licks her lips, the captain can hear her voice permeating through his skull, rattling between the ears like a windchime in a hurricane.\n\n"It is rare to receive guests. The warmth drives away. I have little to offer. Unlike you."\n\nA sickening deal. She offers her services as a guide, offering knowledge of a secret passage that will allow us to safely bypass a great danger. In return, she requests one thing: fresh meat."
 diggy_dungeons.416.a:0 "We are not mere cattle!"
 diggy_dungeons.416.b:0 "This will save lives. It is the only way."

 diggy_dungeons.417.t:0 "Flameskulls from Above!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.417.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Flameskulls are rumored to be the souls of the deceased, incarnate in the form of floating, flaming skulls of moderate killing ability. Their bone-chilling laughter echoes throughout the cavern as a battle formation is assumed, the enemy circling overhead."
 diggy_dungeons.417.a:0 "Clerics forward!"
 diggy_dungeons.417.b:0 "Battle formation!"
 diggy_dungeons.417.c:0 "Warriors, to the front!"

 diggy_dungeons.418.t:0 "Mutiny!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"

 diggy_dungeons.419.t:0 "A Deal Sealed in Blood\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.419.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It was over in an instant, countless souls engulfed by the naga's jaws. No witnesses. They were to have died in a cave-in, a tragic but ultimately unavoidable accident."
 diggy_dungeons.419.a:0 "A necessary sacrifice."

 diggy_dungeons.420.t:0 "Banished with Steel\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.420.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A quick response combined with deadly coordination made quick work of the floating fiends, reducing them to piles of bones. Despite our best efforts, the powdered skulls continue to smolder with a dull flame."

 diggy_dungeons.421.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the skulls pass overhead, they leave deep burns in those they touch and cause chaos throughout our lines. The fight was brutal, but we eventually emerged victorious, though the cost was great."
 diggy_dungeons.421.a:0 "Let's not do that again."

 diggy_dungeons.422.t:0 "Banished with Holy Water\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.422.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the clerics chant their miracles, the flameskulls vanish into puddles of residue, coated in holy water to prevent ressurection."
 diggy_dungeons.422.a:0 "Never leave home without a cleric!"

 diggy_dungeons.423.t:0 "No Laughing Matter\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.423.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The final sounds of demonic cackling are silenced, and the cavern grows silent once more. A quick prayer for the fallen is held, then the expedition moves on."
 diggy_dungeons.423.a:0 "Let us ensure their sacrifice was not in vain."

 diggy_dungeons.424.t:0 "The Perimeter\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.424.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A welcome change from the monotonous igneous rock that dominated the landscape, a dwarven perimeter wall has come into vision. We have reached our first destination."
 diggy_dungeons.424.a:0 "Huzzah!"

 diggy_dungeons.425.t:0 "The Colossal Lavafall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.425.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]An astronomical waterfall of pure lava, crashing into a molten lake over 200 meters below. Such a sight would typically invoke a sense of awe, which was certainly present within our ranks. But this awe quickly turned to dread as the expedition realized that the destination lay at the bottom of this drop, with no side-paths to take."
 diggy_dungeons.425.a:0 "Break out the rock-climbing gear."
 diggy_dungeons.425.b:0 "Time for some extreme canoeing!"

 diggy_dungeons.426.t:0 "Stumbled, but not Fallen\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.426.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rock climbing under such volatile conditions is a tall order, yet the party managed with little trouble. A few unfortunate souls stumbled and perished in the fire below, but the bulk of us remain unscathed, less a few burns."
 diggy_dungeons.426.a:0 "All things considered, that went well."

 diggy_dungeons.427.t:0 "The Story of a Lifetime\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.427.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It is a rare thing to see genuine smiles and laughter following unfathomable danger, yet as the expedition reached the shore of the lava lake, cheers and celebration erupted. This meriment was not born out of hysteria or relief, but rather excitement. Hands shake, chests bump, and soiled greaves are cleaned and polished."
 diggy_dungeons.427.a:0 "No one will believe us."

 diggy_dungeons.428.t:0 "Quite the Fall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.428.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The great weight of our luggage combined with shoddy rock climbing has resulted in quite the wall collapse. As bodies tumble into the lava below, we must simply persevere."
 diggy_dungeons.428.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The field of lava canoeing is a largely unstudied one, unsurprisingly. And equally unsurprising was the result. Making makeshift canoes out of tarps that are definitely not lavaproof, filled to the brim with heavy and flammable cargo, then packing dozens of adventurers on each one, then hurtling this makeshift canoe off of a 200-meter tall cliff whilst lava rains from the sky. It's a miracle any of us survived."
 diggy_dungeons.428.a:0 "How could we have predicted this?"

 diggy_dungeons.429.t:0 "The Great Perimeter\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.429.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Surrounding the Geothermal Facility is a wall fortified with materials yet unknown to us. The vast surface of stone is occasionally interrupted by miniscule cracks seeping through, giving hope that the wall may yet be penetrable. Despite this, it may be best to look for a proper entrance before resorting to the direct approach."
 diggy_dungeons.429.a:0 "Today, we choose violence."
 diggy_dungeons.429.b:0 "Be safe, circle around!"

 diggy_dungeons.430.t:0 "Sturdy Beyond Measure\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.430.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite our best efforts, the wall yet stands, undeterred as if to scoff at the notion of our middling explosives leaving a scratch on it. Though this would typically be a demoralizing sight, fascination quickly sparked from the failure. Such a stone is undocumented by even our most thorough geographer's manuals."
 diggy_dungeons.430.a:0 "A marvelous discovery!"

 diggy_dungeons.431.t:0 "Explosives in a Live Volcano\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.431.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The satisfyingly ear-shattering sounds of explosives ring out throughout the cavern. Not a scratch on the wall. Moments later, eyes widen as the wall begins to rattle. Fleeting hope swiftly becomes despair as a realization is had; the entire cavern is shaking with the ferocity of an active volcano."
 diggy_dungeons.431.a:0 "Duck for cover boys!"

 diggy_dungeons.432.t:0 "The Burning Fever\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.432.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A fever is typically a sign of infection, yet this was clearly not the case within the magmatic depths. The ambient temperature of the caverns was simply high enough to induce fatigue, thirst, and even death. A particularly close pass with a stream of lava launches a new wave of heat at the party."
 diggy_dungeons.432.a:0 "Quickly, the water!"
 diggy_dungeons.432.b:0 "A little sweat never hurt anyone."

 diggy_dungeons.433.t:0 "The Eruption\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.433.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]"This is the last time we use explosives in an active volcano!"\n\nScreams echo throughout the cavern as men frantically seek shelter, begin setting for higher ground, and praying. Yet the calmer among the group manages to ralley the party, organizing them into a search party for an old dwarven failsafe."
 diggy_dungeons.433.a:0 "The dwarves of old were thorough; and so too must we be."

 diggy_dungeons.434.t:0 "Tempered Soul\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.434.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite the horrendous conditions, we stood strong amidst the wails of anguish. We are tenacity incarnate, and we will survive this danger, as we have time and time again."
 diggy_dungeons.434.a:0 "No adventurers will die this day!"

 diggy_dungeons.435.t:0 "The Silent Death\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.435.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Monsters we can deal with. Avalanches, disease, and the cold are preventable. Yet this heat felled more adventurers this day than all three of these things combined. We must pray for the fallen..."
 diggy_dungeons.435.a:0 "...and then continue moving."

 diggy_dungeons.436.t:0 "The Valve that Could.\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.436.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A single valve was all that stood between our lives and the encroaching magma. Yet a simple turn, combined with some old-fashioned elbow grease, was all it took to release the pressure from the volcano and prevent a full eruption."
 diggy_dungeons.436.a:0 "The marvels of engineering."

 diggy_dungeons.437.t:0 "Minor Eruption\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.437.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A minor eruption blasts throughout the caverns, wiping out the entirety of the advance party, and wounding a large portion of the main body. Hardly a party member was left without severe burns, even dozens of meters from the magma flow."
 diggy_dungeons.437.a:0 "Tend to your wounds swiftly, lest the lava comes back for another go."

 diggy_dungeons.438.t:0 "A Motly Camp of Kobolds\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.438.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]An unexpected sight indeed, it appears as though a group of kobolds have made their home alongside the perimeter of the facility, apparently relying on its defense mechanisms to protect themselves. Although everything down here seems to want us dead, these small creatures appear more frightened than anything, scurrying away at the slightest noise and refusing to fight us."
 diggy_dungeons.438.a:0 "Perhaps they can be reasoned with."
 diggy_dungeons.438.b:0 "Get em boys!"

 diggy_dungeons.439.t:0 "Delightful Conversation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.439.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A few words are exchanged between the party linguist and what appears to be the chief of the kobolds. Two truths were revealed. Firstly, these kobolds are legendary masters of Dragonchess, competing with nearby tribes and developing numerous strategies our men had never even dreamed of. Secondly, and probably more importantly, they are not afraid of us, but of what lies aheads."
 diggy_dungeons.439.a:0 "Thanks for the warning, friends."

 diggy_dungeons.440.t:0 "Lost in Translation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.440.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Dozens of tiny feet skitter away as the party linguist trips on his words. It appears as though the linguist had collectively insulted the entire tribe."
 diggy_dungeons.440.a:0 "At least they don't seem angry."

 diggy_dungeons.441.t:0 "Heroic Victory\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.441.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After a brilliant and hard-fought battle, the 3-foot tall kobolds scittered away, without dealing even a single casualty! As the men helped themselves to what wa sleft of the camp, we can't help but wonder why they didn't put up more of a fight."
 diggy_dungeons.441.a:0 "Eh, whatever."

 diggy_dungeons.442.t:0 "Pitfalls Abound\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.442.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the men charged foward, the ground gave way, and the entire advance party tumbled harmlessly into a shallow pit. Though nonlethal, the entire ordeal was very embarassing, and allowed the kobolds ample time to loot our belongings and be on their way."
 diggy_dungeons.442.a:0 "They took my pocketwatch!"

 diggy_dungeons.443.t:0 "Kobolds' Warning\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.443.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We have reached the fork in the road where the kobolds told us the beast would lurk. Taking a right, which is the desired destination, will bring us directly into its nest. Thankfully, we have learned of a roundabout path that should allow us to avoid the creature entirely."
 diggy_dungeons.443.a:0 "For glory!"
 diggy_dungeons.443.b:0 "Heed the kooblds' advice."

 diggy_dungeons.444.t:0 "Behir Sighted!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.444.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Among the creatures that one does not wish to see in the depths of the Dwarovar, the Behir is among the least desirable. A colossal beast, serpentine in nature but with twelve legs, blocks our way, with blue ligtning crackling at its mouth, blue eyes glistening with a sadistic delight. We have been caught wandering in its nest, and the only way out is to fight."
 diggy_dungeons.444.a:0 "For Carl!"

 diggy_dungeons.445.t:0 "The Facility Entrance\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.445.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We've finally arrived. The proper entrance of Dimlherd, the famed Geothermal Facility that powered a large portion of the ancient Dwarven Empire. Though we've reached our destination, all is not well. The clambering racketry of mechanical sentries emanates from the doorway. It is clear that, in order to pass through the door, we must handle the turrets first."
 diggy_dungeons.445.a:0 "To battle!"
 diggy_dungeons.445.b:0 "Let's try throwing some bombs."

 diggy_dungeons.446.t:0 "By Magic and Steel\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"

Down and down following what was once a spiralling stone staircase, now a smooth slope of stone worn by the passage of time and countless feet. The only sounds are the echoing of footsteps and clattering of supplies as each man concentrates on keeping his balance. So preoccupied are the men that they hardly notice it until they're mere feet away - a great gleaming set of steel doors set into the stone wall. The doors are pristine, intricately engraved and polished, so bright in the torchlight that after days of exploration in low light they are difficult to look at directly. Surrounding the doors are an intricate set of gears and levers, beautifully crafted and apparently free of debris.\n\nA cleric squints at the runes repeated across the doors, mouthing them aloud as he translates. "Grumhardhûm, it reads Grumhardhûm'' he calls out. At this, a ripple passes through the gathered expeditionaries. Many have heard stories of the legendary forge of Grumhardhûm, said to have armoured every hero and high king of Aul-Dwarov. It was often rumoured that craftsmen in Grumhardhûm lived for two lifetimes, as a lifetime of expertise was necessary to even be granted the privilege of working there. Few believed the legends referred to a real place, and of those none thought it may still be intact in any form millennia after the fall of Aul-Dwarov. Rumours and stories spread through the gathered men like wildfire, eventually forcing the leader of the expedition to intervene to restore order. Many wish to attempt to enter the forge now, or at least crack open the doors to glimpse the wonders inside. However, the men are tired and lacking supplies - as much as it pains the leader too, he knows they must return home for now. If the wonders of Grumhardhûm have survived until now, they can wait for one more expedition."

As the rest of the expedition pushes past them, it becomes clear why. Before them stands the great steel gate of Grumhardhûm, still resplendent and majestic as it was when it was abandoned, just as the previous expedition had reported. Filled with hope that the great forge had been spared the destruction that befell all else in the Serpentspine, several forward scouts attempt to push the great doors apart to gain entry. Soon there is a line of men pushing upon the doors in unison, but to no avail - the gate remains still and silent."

As the gate closes behind the last man, everyone relaxes. The finely crafted doors are still unblemished and will provide a bulwark against any creatures attempting to sneak in from the rear. Beyond the threshold, the walls of the entrance corridor are covered in pipes and more carvings, but unlike the door these are blackened by soot and grime. The floor is likewise filthy, littered with metal and bone scraps, the unmistakable signs of a goblin infestation. Grimly but resolutely, the expedition moves towards the flickering orange light that illuminates the end of the corridor."

As their spell connects a horrific grinding and shearing of metal upon metal echoes around the caverns, and the expedition instinctively covers their ears and cowers. By the time they look up the once great gates have fallen, now a bent and twisted heap of metal. As the expedition steps over the remains and moves into the forge, the mood is sombre. Each expeditionary mourns the loss of the great gates, not just for their artisanry but also for the defence from rear ambushes they would have provided. Their hopes are further crushed as they see the floor littered with metal and bone scraps and the carvings on the wall defaced by soot, the signs of a goblin infestation. Not wanting to dwell on the gates any longer, the expedition makes haste towards the flickering orange light illuminating the end of the corridor."

 diggy_dungeons.504.t:0 "The Great Forge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.504.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition approaches the end of the corridor, the temperature continues to rise. Soldiers sweat and shift in their heavy armour, looking enviously at the airy robes and simple leather armour afforded to others. Rounding a corner and entering the forge proper, a cavernous circular room bathed in the orange light opens up before them. Magma flows and drips from pipes running the length of the room, running to and from a great pit in the centre of the room. So wide is the pit that, combined with the heat haze present, nobody can see across it to the other side clearly. Some of the braver scouts venture to the edge, peering over it to see a great cauldron far below, suspended by huge chains with each link thicker than a man's torso. There are also simple metal elevators hanging haphazardly below, intended to bring workers to levels below this one, but they appear to be stuck and are out of reach for now. The floor is strewn with soot and debris - all kinds of metal, bone, cloth and food scraps lie everywhere. Looking up, a giant dome is far above, funnelling steam and other vapours into a huge hole at the apex. In the shadow cast by the dome, rusty metal scaffolding and rickety ladders lead to nooks populated with glowing unblinking eyes. Equidistant around the walls are carved stone doorways leading into miscellaneous rooms and antechambers, some with dedicated pipes serving them.\n\nAs the scouts return to report what they saw to the rest of the expedition, one steps upon a discarded sheet of pig iron. A screech of alarm rings out and a ruddy brown arm grabs their ankle - there was a feral goblin sleeping underneath it! Abandoning caution, the scouts sprint back to the main party as more goblins pour from the surrounding rooms and from around the pit. There is barely enough time for the expedition to close ranks around the scouts before the goblins crash into them."

As the remaining goblins turn tail and flee it becomes apparent that the goblins' fallen brethren have brought quite a haul.

 diggy_dungeons.506.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The relentless flood of feral goblins overwhelmed the wall of shields and the expedition scattered, fleeing back down the corridor towards the entrance. By the time the expedition leader had rallied the troops for a counterattack to drive off the goblins, many of the more unfortunate men lay dead and trampled upon the floor in exchange for a pitifully small number of feral goblin lives. The dead are dragged solemnly into the entrance corridor to be retrieved later and the expedition continues as best it can."
 diggy_dungeons.506.a:0 "What a waste of lives…"

 diggy_dungeons.507.t:0 "Beasts Everywhere\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.507.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the immediate danger past, the expedition huddles together in an antechamber near the entrance to plan their next move. The untouched levels below are tantalisingly close, but they cannot continue until all the remaining squatters have been eradicated. The mages and scouts of the expedition present the leader with options for which to deal with first.\n\nHigh above, they have identified the eyes in the shadowed nooks and occasional echoing cries as those of giant cave bats. These bats are even larger than normal and what little of them can be seen has a distinctive reddish tint, leading several mages to suggest they may have been mutated by the residual magics of the forge. If the swarm is not dealt with swiftly, a careless action could bring them down upon the expedition.\n\nSomewhere on the same level as the expedition is the lair of the feral goblins that first assailed them. The remains of the feral goblin charge will have retreated there for safety, as the strongest goblins will be lounging about in the comfort of the lair. The lair will also contain the feral goblin clanboss' choice of loot scavenged from the forge. Cleansing the feral goblins will reward the expedition with these spoils, but it is impossible to know yet just how many lurk within the lair.\n\nLastly, a platform hangs between this level and the next surrounded on all sides by pipes. Judging by the various valves, dials and levers, the area was used to control the flow of liquids through the many pipes in the forge. Most of the controls are in disrepair and those that appear serviceable are covered by magma leaking from weakened pipe junctions. If the flow of magma to the upper levels can be disabled, it will prevent further dangerous leaks from the pipes above. Again, the mages caution that the unstable magics of the forge are likely to have spawned magma oozes wherever magma leaks, but these cannot be separated from regular magma without closer inspection."
 diggy_dungeons.507.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition regroups in the antechamber, leaning against walls and pillars for a well deserved rest. In the meantime, the expedition leader is again presented with the potential options to clear the remaining beasts."
 diggy_dungeons.507.a:0 "Bring down the giant bats!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.b:0 "Cleanse the feral goblin lair!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.c:0 "Splatter the magma oozes!"

 diggy_dungeons.508.t:0 "The Bats Above\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.508.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the antechamber a debate rages among the expedition about how best to handle the bats. "One fireball and the whole swarm will be set alight" argues a trigger-happy mage, "we won't even have to fight them!" This idea is quickly vetoed by the leader of the scouts "Are you crazy? You'll bring the whole scaffold down on us!" Before the mage can snap a response, he continues "besides, this whole place is hotter than a dragon's armpit. Those bats probably eat magma for breakfast… What if your fireballs make them stronger? Then we'll be fighting giant flaming bats!" After several more minutes, the expedition leader steps in to make the final decision - no fireballs. As some of the less disciplined mages sulk, he organises a group of armoured soldiers and light archers to face the bats, leaving the rest of the expedition to hunker down in the antechamber and wait.\n\nThe plan is simplicity itself. The soldiers will stand in a loose square around the archers, ready to protect them from any swooping bats. As of now the swarm has not been alerted so the first strike is the key to the whole operation. The archers have been instructed to aim for the glowing eyes in the darkness, calling out their target's position quietly to ensure no bat is targeted twice. Once all the archers have identified a target they will fire on the lead archer's mark, hopefully killing or disabling most of the swarm before they can even get close. Even without their great numbers the remaining bats may still be dangerous, as their leathery wings have been known to deflect arrows and chip swords. Still, so long as everyone remains calm the casualties should be kept to a minimum."
 diggy_dungeons.508.a:0 "Take aim…"

 diggy_dungeons.509.t:0 "The Goblins Lair\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.509.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Following the trails of blood left by the feral goblins, the expedition's scouts have located the lair. It sits in a room almost antipodal to the entrance, hidden by the heat haze over the central pit. The entrance has been repeatedly smashed and broken, enlarging it enough for more than 6 men to walk through shoulder to shoulder. The adjoining chambers have also had their doorways battered, inner walls collapsed and windows barricaded with sheet metal, creating a rather spacious lair protected from most of the heat of the forge. As the scouts watched, several dead feral goblins were brought from the lair and unceremoniously hurled into the central pit - no doubt their clanboss was angered by their failure to crush the expedition. Unfortunately, with the windows blocked the scouts were unable to ascertain how many goblins remain in the lair or where they store their loot.\n\nDespite the lack of information on their numbers, the expedition leader decides to carry out the strike immediately. Right now the goblins will be bickering and fighting over who should take the blame for their previous attack's failure, and who should risk their life to try again. If they can be caught off guard while trapped in their lair their looted equipment and possible numeric advantage will be completely nullified.\n\nHugging the walls of the forge chamber to remain undetected, the expedition approaches from both sides of the lair simultaneously. At the front are mages escorted by a small retinue of soldiers. On the leader's mark the mages will blast fireballs into the lair, summon flashes of light and plumes of smoke, and generally attempt to disorient all the goblins inside. Any goblins rushing out of the lair for reprieve will be swiftly cut down, and once the mages are spent the main body of the army will enter the lair to mop up the remains. As the leader begins counting down with hand signals a loud belch emanates from the lair doorway. Daring not to breathe, the whole expedition watches powerlessly as a cave troll lumbers out of the doorway. It turns to the side lazily, meeting the leader's gaze uncomprehendingly. As its eyes widen and it raises the misshapen hunk of metal it carries with both hands, the leader desperately cries "Now! Attack now!""
 diggy_dungeons.509.a:0 "Quickly, aim for the eyes!"

 diggy_dungeons.510.t:0 "The Magma Below\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.510.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Unsurprisingly, none of the expedition are keen on being sent down to the magma-covered platform hanging in the pit. After a quick drawing of lots, a small group of soldiers are chosen to accompany a water mage and an engineer down to the platform to attempt to disable the flow of magma. Sending too many men risks the weakened and overheated supports breaking, and so the remainder of the expedition can do nothing but watch as the group is lowered on chains to the platform. As the first soldier touches down on one of the few magma-free spaces, two magma oozes leap at them from the surrounding magma! Only a quick burst of water from the mage above him keeps them from engulfing him, and they are visibly shaken as the oozes recoil back into the safety of the magma.\n\nThe next few minutes are much the same - the group makes painfully slow progress across the platform, clearing pools of magma and dodging magma ooze ambushes as best they can. As they reach the dense tangle of pipes with controls, the engineer suddenly cries out "I can see the emergency shutoff pipes, but the valves are broken! I can't close them!". There is little time to make a decision - the water mage is visibly exhausted and out of mana potions, and several of the group have already perished to the oozes. If the valves can be repaired and the flow of magma arrested then the magma oozes on the platform will be severely weakened, perhaps enough to save the brave men down there. Though, their situation is already pretty dire… what's the worst that could happen if the group is simply allowed to perish?"

 diggy_dungeons.511.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the surrounding beasts cleared and the expedition out of danger for now, interest in exploring the lower levels of the forge is reignited. The elevators once used to travel between floors hang below, their chains tangled and rusted. Many of the elevators are missing platforms and guardrails and some have come loose altogether, barely visible laying battered and broken deep in the pit. In this state the expedition leader would be hard pressed to find a single man willing to travel down using these, let alone a whole expedition.\n\nAfter several hours of examinations with telescopes and attempts to untangle the elevators with blasts of air, the engineers have come up with a plan. Though most of the elevators are not worth fixing, a group of larger freight elevators have been preserved in good condition and have swung free from the debris binding them thanks to the efforts of the mages. Unfortunately, the brakes are still deployed on each elevator and their chains have been greatly weakened by the friction as the elevators slipped further and further down over time. If these elevators are hauled up intact, the only major repair required is the replacement of the length of chain that hung above the elevators. However, the engineers caution that the new chain must be of sufficiently sturdy metal or the next elevator to fall may take half the expedition with it.\n\nAmid the rhythmic cries of "Heave, Ho!" as the men haul the elevators up, the expedition leader considers his options. The expedition has small stores of steel, iron and bronze reserved for mending armour and emergency structural repairs. In a pinch, these could be fashioned into remarkably sturdy chains. Alternatively, the metal scraps strewn across the forge could be used instead - after all, they were good enough for the old dwarves of Grumhardhûm."

The remaining bats shriek and swoop, their fangs sharper and hide tougher than expected, but with their numbers so thin casualties from the expedition are left few and far between.

 diggy_dungeons.521.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition once again passes over the threshold of Grumhardhûm, the familiar heat of the forge hits them. This time, most of the expedition members have stowed the heavy armour they wore through the caves in favour of lighter leather and hide armour. Some mages have even procured magical armour engraved with temperature controlling runes, much to the jealousy of the other members. Many survivors of the last expedition have returned as expected, eager to see what hides in the lower levels that were made accessible by their previous efforts.\n\nSince the last expedition some small exploratory parties have braved the journey to the lower levels to scout ahead. All turned back quickly from the heat, unsettled by the unnatural emptiness of the cavernous forge. Their efforts were not in vain, however, as the last party noticed a peculiar stack of engraved metal plates on the lower levels near an elevator. Some of these plates were scattered around as well and they appear to have all originally been identical. The plates are all melted, dented, torn or scratched in different places - no fully intact plate exists. The engraving is clearly some form of runic script, but deciphering the whole message is difficult. Additionally, the back of some of the plates holds a different engraving.

The message on the rear is a notice to workers, reminding them what they should do if the great furnace beneath the forge was to ever go out.

 diggy_dungeons.525.t:0 "Beneath The Cauldron\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.525.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition travels slowly down the repaired freight elevators, they take in the sights surrounding the huge cauldron of the great forge. Metal rings of flooring similar to the top level surround the cauldron at different heights. Great pipes lead to and from the cauldron and smaller vats, forges, smithing stations and carved chambers on each floor. These floors are much better preserved and have not been infested by squatters, owing to the difficulty of reaching them. Still, the squatters managed to despoil the lower floors with rotting bodies and trash left lying near the edges of the floors and piled up in the great cauldron, thrown into the central pit with no care for the destination. Soot blankets the floors and walls of each level, crunching underfoot and leaving ugly black stains behind. Below the huge cauldron on the bottom floor lies a fine mesh, still smouldering and belching strange vapours. The great furnace below has not completely extinguished even after millenia of disuse, leaving the whole of Grumhardhûm swelteringly hot. Some engineers of the expedition shudder, imagining working here when the furnace was still at full blast.\n\nOnce the repaired elevators touch the bottom floor for the first time, the expedition's scouts dart off to explore the depths of Grumhardhûm. A ring of engraved steel surrounds the mesh on the bottom floor, though it is difficult to see through the ankle-high piles of dust, bones, soot and metal scraps that have collected over time. A rough stone tunnel is the only exit in the walls of the bottom floor, in line with the entrance gate far above. The scouts who entered the tunnel return blackened with soot and panting for breath. They descended in a gentle sloping spiral, approaching the smouldering furnace beneath the mesh. Their exploration was halted by magma pouring lazily from cracks above and in the walls, covering the huge steel bridge in front of them. As far as they could tell the bridge is still intact but the magma must be cleared to gain access to the furnace.\n\nAfter reviewing the structure and pipeworks of the forge, the engineers of the expedition have determined the magma blocking the bridge should be flowing into the furnace below. Something is blocking the pipes into the furnace and causing an overflow of magma. How the forge is still smouldering without the heat from the magma is unknown, but irrelevant for now. Judging by the inscriptions that remain on each level the penultimate level is the best bet to clear the magma. Somewhere on that floor are the controls to manage the flow of magma, and water used to generate steam, into the furnace below. The scouts look to the expedition leader, wondering where to search first."
 diggy_dungeons.525.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition exits the chamber, returning to the soot-strewn penultimate level of the forge. Everyone settles down, leaning against walls and pipes to catch their breath as best they can in the sweltering heat of the forge.

 diggy_dungeons.526.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The left side of the penultimate level is home to a series of small control chambers. All these chambers were once almost identical, containing pipes rising up from the floor and into the ceiling of each, adorned with various valves and levers. Now the control chambers are a spectrum from almost untouched to no more than a pile of rubble in a doorway. Unfortunately the inscriptions above each room have long since worn away, making it difficult to tell what purpose even the intact control rooms serve. After a fruitless search for any more clues to each room's purpose, the expedition leader dispatches an engineer and a mage to the bottom floor. With a combination of divination and mechanical knowledge, they locate the pipes buried in the rock that run to the furnace and follow them back up into the chamber that controls them.\n\nAt first it appeared that the expedition was out of luck - the chamber the engineer pointed to was one full of rubble. After a little excavation, however, it was clear that the rubble was from the partial collapse of only one wall. With some improved braces a further collapse is prevented, and once the rubble is cleared out the expedition leader can walk through the open path into the control chamber. Mercifully, the pipes and controls were not touched by the collapse and are still mostly intact.\n\nThere are only three controls on the pipes, a pair of iron valves surrounding a strange reddish lever. The valves were once coloured too - there are small flecks of paint still stuck to the rear of them. It seems that the left valve was once a peculiar light green, while the right valve was a deep yellow colour. Aside from the pipes running up the back wall and these controls, the room is an empty uniform cube only large enough for a handful of people. Alone in the room for now, the expedition leader ponders his options."

Unusually, there's a large carved stone tunnel as well. It's long but narrow, with smoothly curving walls and tipped with a simple stone staircase leading upwards. Curiously the air in the tunnel is comparatively cooler and pleasantly humid, more akin to a beach holiday than a desert trek. The scouts sent into the tunnel are forced to return soon, however. The flickering orange light from above the staircase and the chaotic magic energies swirling in the tunnel can only mean one thing - an infestation of magma oozes.\n\nThe cool air means there is very little magma in the tunnel, so each ooze should be comparatively weaker than the ones experienced on the first floor. Still, the tunnel is far too narrow for a large force to enter, whereas the amorphous oozes will have no problem utilising their numbers.

It engulfs that section of the bridge, and the unfortunate scouts, in a single movement. The scouts never even had a chance to scream. Breaking free from his stupor, the expedition leader has only seconds to decide on a course of action before the ooze engulfs them too."

As one scout scrapes at the magma with his sword, an ooze leaps out and engulfs his arm! As he stumbles back, more oozes appear from the magma all around the expedition. Luckily their numbers aren't overwhelming, but with so much magma around they'll be far more dangerous than the ones encountered earlier. The men group up as best they can, shoulder to shoulder, ready to meet any oncoming oozes."

 diggy_dungeons.537.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition advances towards the location of the furnace, the tunnel becomes rougher and less uniform. This was clearly once part of a natural cave system and was left mostly untouched by the dwarves constructing the forge. Light flickers strangely off ore seams and the walls seem to close in as they keep advancing. The heat grows and grows until the expedition is walking through a visible heat haze, with many mages reporting visible magical distortions as well. Finally, a huge pair of doors are illuminated before them. These are similar to the doors at the entrance of the Grumhardhûm, but they show signs of being hastily barricaded from this side. Steel bars, sheets of iron and other makeshift materials have been bolted and welded to the gates and hastily carved inscriptions and wards cover the whole door. Evidently, despite the forge being abandoned in a hurry, the inhabitants were gravely concerned about whatever was behind that door.\n\nThis is the last straw for the expedition leader. Many of the expedition are at risk of passing out from the heat, with mages reporting nausea and dizziness from the chaotic magical energies swirling before the doors. He knows that in this state even a flock of bats would pose a serious challenge, let alone whatever is sealed behind those doors. The expedition retreats back across the steel bridge for now, resolving to return better prepared to face whatever lies inside."

 diggy_dungeons.538.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The cause of the pleasant climate in the tunnel is revealed as the expedition emerges into a naturally formed underground cavern. The difference between the work of nature and of man is striking after so long spent in the painstakingly carved rooms of the forge. It appears that once a great underground river flowed through the cavern, slowly carving peculiar channels into the rock. The sound of flowing water still echoes down the cavern, but a bronze dam blocks the river. The dam stretches most of the way up to the cavern ceiling, with four great gates lined along the base. These four gates are open, but clogged with debris from upstream, leaving the underground riverbed bone dry. Scouts sent to climb the dam report that there's a bubbling stream on the other side, not quite large enough to fill the whole cavern even with the dam open. At the other end of the underground riverbed, the floor suddenly drops and huge pipes snake off in different directions to deliver water to the forge.\n\nIt seems that the dam gates were once controlled mechanically, as they are far too heavy to be operated by hand. They also had retractable grates, presumably to prevent them being clogged as they are now, but they were either torn from the dam or left up. The valves and levers on the dam itself do nothing now, so the debris will need to be cleared another way."

 diggy_dungeons.539.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Surviving members of the expedition lay sprawled across the ground on the other side of the bridge, panting and heaving for breath. The great ooze took many expedition members as it surged down the bridge, but it was reluctant to step off the bridge and away from the pool of magma. This moment of hesitation was just barely enough to allow the men time to counter attack. They fought desperately, even throwing their shields and armour at the ooze to try and delay it. After a truly herculean effort from every member the ooze suddenly broke apart, returning to an inert pool of magma and slipping from the bridge. Now, as the expedition leader takes stock of those who have survived, he notices a battered steel chest covered in weakly glowing runes left behind on the bridge. The magma must have swallowed this chest long ago but thanks to the protective runes carved upon it the contents are still intact. Inside are a cache of ancient dwarven scriptures and engravings. Such well preserved artefacts are vanishingly rare, worth their weight in gold."

Weapons sank into the great ooze and spells bounced off ineffectually while it continued its inexorable advance. As the expedition was nearing complete defeat, the last survivors retreated beyond the threshold of the steel bridge. Opting not to leave the vicinity of the magma pool, the ooze instead slipped away over the bridge and disappeared. It took several hours before a scout braved the bridge again, reporting that the ooze appears to have left the expedition alone for now."

Not allowing the oozes any time to group up, each new ooze is quickly set upon and crushed into a magmatic paste. Nevertheless the oozes reappear almost as quickly as they're destroyed. As new oozes spawn the flow of magma from above slows, and the oozes slow too. Eventually, having used most of the pooled magma, the last oozes are destroyed by the expedition. With the magma gone the bridge is much easier to traverse, making the job of the clerics tasked with collecting the oozes dropped loot much simpler."

These pieces must be carefully manoeuvred and pulled forwards out of the blockages. The pressure of the water behind the debris is both a blessing and a curse, necessitating extra safety precautions. Each expedition member is tied to ropes ready to catch them when the blockage has been weakened enough and decides to suddenly break free. After several close calls with rushing water and flying debris, and a little extra help from water mages standing on top of the dam, the blockages are cleared and water once again flows through the riverbed."

The sound of the explosion booms through the tunnel, echoing off the curved walls countless times and shaking dust loose from the ceiling.

As the other expedition members drop their tools to help, the debris at the other gates breaks free as well! In a flash, everyone who was clearing the debris is now scrambling to escape the growing river.

The wards on the doors were powerful, still weakly flickering after so long, but have been nullified. The inscriptions hastily scrawled across the door are an epithet, repeated in several ancient scripts including old dwarven. "They all roughly mean Old Fire Lord, Aldorlbûr in the forge's native dwarven", explains a linguist brought along to examine the doors. A noble with such a title doesn't appear in any ancient chronology, though it hardly matters as any living being would have perished after so long locked inside the furnace. As the last bars are torn from the doors they swing open eerily of their own accord, revealing the top of a scorched steel staircase.\n\nA blast of hot stale air from inside the doors washes over the waiting expedition members. The heat throughout the forge has worsened since the previous expedition cleared the magma from the bridge into the furnace, but this extra heat is the final straw. Everyone stumbles back from the doors hoping to escape the dry heat licking at their bodies. Ignoring the orders of the expedition leader, most of the men continue to retreat back as far as they can from the doors and towards the comparatively cooler forge.\n\nWith the whole expedition gathered before the bridge again, the mood is low and many wish to turn back before even entering the furnace.

This situation certainly qualifies, but the system of levers and pulleys that once held the chains have been left a twisted wreck. The expedition leader has no choice but to send men to hold the bare chains, with naught for leverage but their muscles. They will need to hold the floodgates up for as long as possible to maximise the amount of water to the emergency pipes.

The other floodgate soon follows, leaving the volunteers gasping on the slick cavern floor.

Having men manning these cannons from such a vantage point would be invaluable.

As the expedition members cry out and lunge for safety, it pauses rather than pressing on and instead circles around. Is it toying with the expedition, or genuinely wary of them? It matters not, as the torn pipes open a new escape route for the expedition.

Able to inspect the cage closely for the first time, the expedition's mages determine that aside from some minor scratches and burns, the runes are pristine but nevertheless mostly inactive. The floor surrounding the cage is much different, bearing deep scorch marks and gouges. Discarded pieces of armour have been welded to the floor by the heat and are surrounded by piles of ash, the remains of whatever unfortunate souls surrounded Aldorlbûr when it escaped. The wards must have been tremendously powerful to keep the elemental imprisoned for so long and to sustain such little damage as it ravaged the area as revenge. If the mages can repair the minor damage and provide enough mana to the wards again, the cage should be capable of suppressing the fire elemental even when it is at nearly full power.

Though each of Aldorlbûr's attacks are blindingly quick they also open the fire elemental to counterattack while their fiery body is stabilising again. It is difficult to ignore the desperate cries of those Aldorlbûr has left badly burned but there is nothing the expedition's medics can do until the fire elemental is clear. Wary of overextending, both the expedition and Aldorlbûr circle each other, making occasional probing attacks. If physical attacks do any lasting damage to Aldorlbûr is unknown, so instead these serve as a distraction for mages to strike. It has been struck with various spells and projectiles by now, but unfortunately very little water. The elemental dances and dodges around even a drop of water, evaporating it or hurling pipes at it rather than meeting it with its body. This fear is easily exploited to create openings, but the unlucky person who sent the water is usually targeted and incinerated by the elemental soon after. After what feels like hours, the fire elemental is finally beginning to show signs of weakness. Its body no longer burns so painfully bright and its attack range and speed have lowered noticeably.\n\nIn a stroke of luck, a brave mage blasts a jet of icy water at Aldorlbûr right as it rears up for another attack. Unable to dodge, the water strikes its centre mass and this time it visibly recoils with a horrible shriek. The mage is reduced to ashes soon after, but the damage has been done. Clearly rattled by such a hit, Aldorlbûr is now squarely on the defensive. It no longer initiates attacks, opting instead to slip and weave away from all projectiles, waiting for men to overcommit. Focusing entirely on defence makes the elemental near untouchable - after some time of this with precious few hits it begins to regain confidence, apparently unaware of the expedition's true plan. Hoping to corral it back towards the cage to seal it back for good by utilising its newfound wariness, the expedition have been carefully guiding Aldorlbûr with their attacks. With each casual dodge, the fire elemental approaches the cage inch by inch."

 diggy_dungeons.561.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Waves of fire crash into the expedition, roasting and burning indiscriminately. They fight valiantly, but the fury of Aldorlbûr is simply too raw, too powerful. The expedition leader watches helplessly from the cavern floor as the last of his men run aflame back into the maze of piping, hoping desperately to escape. Aldorlbûr waits cruelly, letting them exhaust themselves and those around him burn to death in agony. Hoping to distract it long enough for even one man to flee, the expedition leader lunges for Aldorlbûr. For a moment he swears he can see the ghost of a smile on the fire elemental's smooth head, and then…\n\nThe small guard left outside the steel doors to the furnace are playing cards, bored and sweaty. An agonised wail echoes out from the furnace entrance, jolting the guards from their game. They rush in, finding a half-burnt engineer collapsed at the base of the entrance staircase. They carry him out and lay him on their makeshift table, but it is too late. So terrible was the heat he endured that his clothes have fused with his body and his eyes have melted shut. Barely audible, all he murmurs is "Aldorlbûr… Aldorlbûr…" until he finally dies minutes later. The guards wait and wait, but no more survivors ever appear."

 diggy_dungeons.562.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Before the expedition could flee, Aldorlbûr suddenly leapt forward and encircled a portion of the expedition in towering flames. With the fire elemental distracted with its new playthings, the rest of the expedition slipped away with the screams of their fellows echoing in their ears. Wracked with guilt, they distract themselves with the mindless task of navigating the cavern."

 diggy_dungeons.563.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Resting for a moment near a group of crumbling stone pillars, the expedition lets out a collective sigh of relief after escaping from Aldorlbûr again. Using the hole in the pipes the fire elemental created, they were able to slip around it as it circled them and once again flee from it practically unscathed. Though most are overjoyed, some can't help but wonder if Aldorlbûr is simply savouring the chase…"

 diggy_dungeons.564.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The last mage stumbles back, drained, as the wards hum back to life. Even the non magical members of the expedition can feel the wards tugging at them, yearning to imprison and stifle them. The cage emits a steady, comforting hum as well. The strength of the cage is not in doubt to anyone - if Aldorlbûr can be brought here then it will certainly be defeated and imprisoned once more. The only problem is it is equally aware of this, likely preferring to die fighting than end up in there for another eternity. Stiil, the newly powered up cage provides more than a measure of comfort."

Frozen in the throes of a desperate defence, these are clearly abandoned security golems. Many appear to have survived Aldorlbûr's wrath in good condition, but closer inspection reveals that their joints have fused from the heat. Their mana batteries are still serviceable but they will need to be carefully repaired before being recharged to be of any use. An army of unflinching golems mostly immune to the heat will be the perfect distraction, so long as they can actually fight. As engineers and mages try to co-operate on the golems, men keep a nervous watch on them. The golems should recognise the fire elemental as the bigger threat and assist the expedition, but who knows what time and decay has done to their programming."

 diggy_dungeons.566.t:0 "The Final Push\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.566.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Aldorlbûr is beginning to tire of fighting. All the while it was trapped in that horrible prison it had yearned to burn and scorch with impunity. Outside, no being should be equal to it! Pure fire reduces all to ashes, nothing should be able to quench it! Yet the accursed mortals that invaded its cavern stubbornly defy its flames, refusing to submit. At first Aldorlbûr was glad to have new playthings, but they now behave more like an insect buzzing incessantly about its head. Hounded by the expedition, as much as Aldorlbûr does not want to admit it, they are beginning to wound it deeply. Occupied with hate and visions of sending the expedition to a fiery demise, Aldorlbûr doesn't feel the tugging on its very being until it is too late - it stands before its most hated cage with the expedition to its back. No escape.\n\nThe expedition watches as the fire elemental freezes in place before the runic cage, finally understanding their plan. It sends tendrils of flames to the walls and cage, but they suddenly recoil before even halfway. Its prideful demeanour has collapsed and its fear of the cage is palpable, but with the exit blocked by the expedition Aldorlbûr has no choice but to attack them once more. This time, it won't be holding back."
 diggy_dungeons.566.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Aldorlbûr is deceptively close to the runic cage, but by no means is the final stretch the simplest. Many have perished to it already, as it has turned into a flaming bulwark with the last of its strength. Denying the expedition the satisfaction of victory, Aldorlbûr would clearly rather be reduced to cinders than return to the cage. Nevertheless, to come this far and fail here is unacceptable. "It is worse off than we are! Look, its desperation is clear. It needs only one more push, just one strong strike! Just once more!" cries the expedition leader as the exhausted elemental rears up for another wave of fire."

Raining water down on the elemental would be an excellent assistance, if only it was that simple. The pipes invite flashbacks of the forges control rooms, covered in valves and levers of obscure purpose. The expedition leader has no choice but to assign volunteers to follow each pipe junction and determine what it carries and where. Painstakingly slowly, the engineers construct a mental map of the pipes in the cavern, turning valves and pulling levers to try and fill the sprinklers above once more."

Waves and waves of blue fire roll off of the elemental, forcing the expedition to take cover wherever they can. Finally, the waves of fire stop and men step out to finish the exhausted elemental. They are met with another wall of flames - it was a trap! Those at the front absorb most of the heat leaving those at the back physically unharmed, but the shock of seeing their fellows burn to death under their noses stuns them completely. With the expedition routed temporarily, Aldorlbûr sags again - this time, it really is exhausted. So painfully close to victory, the expedition leader picks himself up and rallies the expedition for another push."

 diggy_dungeons.570.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Step by step, the expedition closes in on Aldorlbûr. No longer can it incinerate them lazily as it had so many of their fellows, its paltry blasts of fire easily blocked by mages and shields. It is clear that Aldorlbûr is now the hunted rather than the hunter. Within touching distance now, a barrage of arrows, magical projectiles and even canteens of water are hurled at the fire elemental as it desperately hangs on to the rocky floor. Losing purchase, the gravity of the cage finally exceeds its strength and it begins to slip further and further back towards it. Desperate otherworldly shrieks and cries unlike anything the expedition have heard echo around the cavern. As a last ditch effort, Aldorlbûr abandons its form and looses fiery tendrils to all corners of the room and ceiling searching desperately for an escape. Hacking at the living fire with swords and dousing it with water weakens the tendrils, which flicker, then disappear completely. Reduced to nothing more than a fist sized orb of fire, Aldorlbûr is jerked back into the runic cage as the front swings shut with a conclusive crash.\n\nThe triumphant expedition still lays upon the floor hours later, completely exhausted from their efforts. Before them Aldorlbûr seethes inside the runic cage, trapped again for the foreseeable future. With the whole of the Grumhardhûm cleared and free of danger and the ancient source of heat sealed once again the complete reconstruction of the forge can begin in earnest. Well, another group can head down to the furnace to do the repairs in earnest - the expedition members will be looking forward to their pay and a nice long vacation somewhere cool after this harrowing experience."

 diggy_dungeons.628.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The elementals are tough enemies to fight as their magic-infused bodies seldom allow for attacks to penetrate them.

Nevertheless your experience wins out once again and aimed strikes at their weak points quickly cause them to collapse. As you inspect the remnants of the attackers afterwards you notice a few small tracks that were left by the faster, more dangerous security automatons and follow them to their source - a small storage and maintenance area well-hidden behind a small side shaft that houses not only spare parts galore but a large amount of gems that were seemingly used to power the spheres!"

Many of your less experienced men thus take blade wounds as they are not used to the swift switches, parries and formations of the humming objects.

The scholars in your expedition in the meantime found out that a reboot of the entire pump station is necessary for the rest of the systems to function properly again and provide the rest of the workshop with sufficient electricity. You gather everyone and venture towards the pump station near the bottom of the complex. You barely even reach the entrance of the corresponding area when your scouts warn you about the sighting of a giant water elemental roaming the mostly flooded corridors."

Suddenly, one of them has an epiphany - how about they try to reroute the cords attached to the entire system and attempt to rewire another axle as a substitute system? The second engineer agrees - brilliant suggestions! They get to work immediately, remove one of the main wires and… trigger the security system. One row of the spherical objects surrounding the big transmitter suddenly springs to life and charges at you with what seems to be sharp knives."

 diggy_dungeons.637.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The broken axle turns out to be a bigger problem than imagined and two of your best engineers spend a good hour on it. Thankfully, though, they have a reputation as the best not without reasons. A quick rewiring of the security system allows for a rash replacement of a few axles, tubes and cords to ensure the transmission can work as intended again. As a bonus, the now disabled security system allows the rest of the group access to previously locked rooms containing various crates of rare metals, currency and valuable belongings of past workers."

Its lunges are fast, its attacks come without any hint and thus leave barely time to evade. You lose many men, but manage to parry most of its devastating attacks, eventually driving it into a corner. In this moment the elemental contracts and starts pulsing in unusual ways.. most curious and most deadly, too. In what can only be described as a steam explosion the creature lets loose a grand last attack, which kills half a dozen men instantly, gravely wounds another dozen and decimates parts of the station entirely. Thankfully no critical infrastructure was hit and while it seemed as though the entire station might collapse at any point in time now, the beams hold and you breathe a sigh of relief as you restart the pumps. Some of your men also discover a large deposit of gold a clever worker decades ago must have hidden in a small alcove that now lays bare thanks to the elemental's brute force attack."

From surprisingly lavish furniture dotting the corners to astutely put together walkways leading to other rooms, you just now begin to notice how gifted the workforce in this workshop really was. Several, previously locked doors are now open to you and your gaze lingers on two options, neatly displayed by a sign above two peculiar doorways: "The Forge", with a promise of uncovering the technological marvels that may lie dormant in this complex; or the "Gem Storage", which makes many in your groups ecstatic with its allure of endless riches."

You all grab as much as you can carry and move on, there must be more to uncover!"

And sure enough, once you enter the Forge itself you see several large smelting furnaces that are now powered up and ready to continue producing raw materials for the smithies ahead. However, it also seems the decades of abandonment have led to deterioration of a few key components as one of the furnaces near the middle of the forge halls is spewing out flames, with plenty of nearby equipment being ignited by it as well."

And true enough, you enter a workshop full of filigrane tools, smaller workstations and a few truly large gems that truly defy all expectations you had for this place. They are so enormous that their height tops the largest men in your force and their worth is beyond mortal comprehension. You immediately try to search for ways to split and transport them away from this place, when you suddenly notice something strange… the stones seem to have moved. And not only that, the air in this place seems to be filled with a strange vibrato.. Now highly alert, you begin to ready your weapons, but it is already too late. The giant gemstones suddenly morph into something akin to a golem and attack instantly. One swing of their newly formed diamond-hard claws is enough to rip through armor and send your troops flying…"

 diggy_dungeons.702.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The puzzle was, relatively speaking, actually quite simple in execution after we figured out what to do. Upon closer inspection there was a groove in the floor where the largest disc was meant to lay, but the smallest was there instead. Each disc also had runes carved in such a way that the discs would interlock and "stack" with each other, but only from bottom to top. Eventually, we managed to stack them, creating a five disc tower. When completed, it and the poles sank into the floor, and the vault. With that the way is now clear and now… "
 diggy_dungeons.702.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We've managed to open the way beyond the gateway by using our mages to overload the warding runes, done so by effectively supercharging them and turning them against the door itself.

It promptly began to assault the expedition, killing three score individuals before being brought down by a carefully timed blast from a mage. The door did not close behind the golem however, and the way is now open."
 diggy_dungeons.703.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our attempt to blast open the vault was sound, and indeed if it was even slightly less well made, we're sure it would have worked.

Runes covered the walls, the ceiling, and the floor, and though hesitant, we continued forward until one of our forward mages signaled the expedition to halt. Tossing a rock down the hallway, where it skipped across the floor. Seemingly relieved when nothing happened, they looked at their feet, and then promptly were thrown back by an explosion. Scorched but alive, they state that someone, followed by a string of curses, has filled the hallway with explosive runes. They state that it's purely runes that are activated by sight, and that simply not looking would suffice. One of the medics tending them said that they could probably spare bandages to use as blindfolds, though that it would also cut into the expedition's supplies."

However, after some time this began to devolve into conflicting commands, and eventually someone finally caved and opened their eyes to see where they were going, only to turn and face an explosive rune.\n\nThe resulting explosions killed a number of our expeditionaries, and those not killed outright set off other explosions, until the hall was empty.

A lot of effort, in all… "
 diggy_dungeons.706.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The bandages made sufficient blindfolds, obstructing vision but not blocking it completely.

In the scramble to assemble battle lines, some more of our greedy expeditionaries, laden down with loot, were promptly cleaved in two by a greatsword the size of an ogre.

Of course, the golem also began to approach the moment the door opened, but just as it raised its greatsword to cleave the mage in two, its runes glowed blue and its arms slackened, greatsword clattering to the ground just footsteps away from our mage.

In a panic, one mage nearby channels more energy into a spell than they should have, throwing it at the golem. A blinding light, the cracking of steel and the screaming of our troops closest to the golem followed, as when the light faded, the golem's torso was bent, and melting. Numerous expeditionaries were on the floor, writhing in pain either from the molten slag that had splashed them, or from the blinding light.

Of course, they also state that without fresh material, the spiders may be at this for some time. A hesitant debate about whether or not risking the golem remaining a ticking disaster or being dealt with immediately was held, but in the end the expedition decided to agree with the mages' plan.\n\nIt was a careful, cautious thing. Everyone was on edge until the very last moment, when the spell was cast just as the golem was reactivating. It stood, reached for its sword… and did nothing.

Set in front of these are steel cargo conveyors; a fixture of ancient dwarven mines to move excavated materials out of pits which, in a labyrinthine system, cross the entire hall where it seems that the material travels from point to point.

Its features were jagged, with crude artistic carvings of animals and things none were familiar with. Accompanying these features are runes not of a dwarven make, but something utterly alien. Glowing with a faint purple energy, they almost draw the observer in, body and soul.

The runes in the archway aren't dwarven, but possess a vague resemblance to examples of certain goblin script variations. But we can say it definitely leads somewhere on this world, and it is not an interplanar portal." Many of their fellows agreed, saying that the insights alone would be valuable once returned with. However, the investigation ended there as one of their number shouted that the portal was activating, seemingly on its own. Quickly, they retreated to a safe distance as a chaotic vortex of purple energy formed, as many could feel the air pressure in the room drop as a powerful gust of wind headed towards the portal.

 diggy_dungeons.803.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After a few days of search the scouts have found a clear path into the chasm. An underground river has carved a steady decline into the rock that we can follow without a problem.\n\nAs we continue on downwards the carved rock reveals gold and gems in the walls. Without much debating, the men get out some pickaxes and start excavating the treasure. With a song on their lips and their coffers already noticeably heavier they continue down in the best of spirits."
 diggy_dungeons.803.a:0 "Let us sing a hiker's song!"

 diggy_dungeons.804.t:0 "Snaking the Wall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.804.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Carefully the soldiers apply and reapply the rope where needed. In small groups, we descend into the pit, but every step is safe and secure. The slow climb has people on the lookout for other things, which has born us riches: It would seem others have tried our approach as well, trying to get down here, but they did not fare so well. Some of their backpacks are still hanging on the spikes, we just need to grab them and what's inside is ours."
 diggy_dungeons.804.a:0 "This went remarkably well"

 diggy_dungeons.805.t:0 "The Fingers of Death\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.805.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The rope's promise of safety is as alluring as it is misleading. The spikes are slippery, the rope has nowhere to be fastened to, and every once in a while a climber falls to their death: That is the reality of our endeavour. At some point, it became useless to count how many had fallen and the soldiers just agreed to ignore it. Everyone for themselves.\n\nFinally on the ground we can see the terrible toll the wall has taken on us. At least one hundred corpses piled just here, with more dispersed around the area. The expedition leader looks away and into the chasm stretching out next to us, eager to continue and let this small disaster behind him."
 diggy_dungeons.805.a:0 "Let's see what else this damnable pit has to offer"

 diggy_dungeons.806.t:0 "Rope Bridge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.806.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The chasm had offered us two paths a few days ago, one down and one keeping level. After some deliberation, the expedition chose to go onward on their current level. This has yielded tentative agreement from the explorers as they did not want to go down much further for now.\n\nThe path turned out to be interesting enough in its own right. It snakes along the walls of the chasm and at some point, we could make out a similar path on the other side. Some were discussing how we might get over there, but even before they could come to a conclusion, the scouts reported they had sighted a rope bridge just ahead.\n\nThe rackety structure is made of thick rope and sturdy wood, but it does show signs of wear and tear. The question it poses is simple: Do we need to secure it? Or will it hold the weight of our expedition on its own? "
 diggy_dungeons.806.a:0 "It'll hold"
 diggy_dungeons.806.b:0 "Secure it"

 diggy_dungeons.807.t:0 "Fungal Flats\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.807.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Following our adventure down the rope has led us to another point of interest: In the distant dark the scouts have made out some kind of terraces along the side of the wall. After arriving there, we noticed that these are old terrace farms, now entirely overgrown by a strange kind of fungus. It looks like nothing we had seen before and there was some interest in sampling it. The cooks were especially fascinated by its unique sweet-savoury odour."
 diggy_dungeons.807.a:0 "A few fungi? What's the worst that can happen"
 diggy_dungeons.807.b:0 "Don't eat that, who knows what this could be?"

 diggy_dungeons.808.t:0 "Across the Dark\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.808.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the end the bridge did hold our weight. Without much problem (but a considerable amount of swinging) the expedition could cross the chasm in small groups. On the other side was a small campsite with long abandoned tents showing signs of animal attacks. Inside a few skeletons could be found, still clutching their belongings."
 diggy_dungeons.808.a:0 "They won't need those anymore"

 diggy_dungeons.809.t:0 "Oh Snap!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.809.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It is strange how a single sound can absolutely devastate a person.After most of the expedition had crossed the bridge the rope gave up. With an audible snap the bridge broke apart, sending the men in free fall into the dark below."
 diggy_dungeons.809.a:0 "How horrible"

 diggy_dungeons.810.t:0 "Old Campsite\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.810.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the old bridge behind us we have stumbled across a large abandoned campsite, almost constituting a small village. This sparked immediate interest in what might be possible to uncover here, since all the occupants seem to have abandoned it long ago."
 diggy_dungeons.810.a:0 "Investigate"

 diggy_dungeons.811.t:0 "A Hearty Meal\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.811.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The cooks prepared a mighty meal with the mushrooms which invigorated the soldiers. With this newfound elan some decided to start planting more mushrooms, should they return via this way again. What they didn't think was finding buried chests in the ground. With a few ropes and muscles put to work seven chests filled with gold and gems could be unearthed."
 diggy_dungeons.811.a:0 "Food and loot? What a great place!"

 diggy_dungeons.812.t:0 "POISON!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.812.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Well, who would have thought that. The eating spree yesterday turned out to be a stupid idea. This morning many people have started complaining about strong abdominal pain and vomiting. As the day went on the fever came. Then the hallucinations. And finally, death. The cooks try to find some, any excuses, but there are none. Still, we need to eat so they are spared. For now."
 diggy_dungeons.812.a:0 "Stop just putting things in your mouths!"

 diggy_dungeons.813.t:0 "Waterfall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.813.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The thundering clash and hammering of water against the beaten rock echoes through the chasm. The rushing masses have carved their own way deep into the rock, their source hidden somewhere far above, their destination deep below. It poses an almost impassable obstacle since the crushing stream of water would turn us into flat sheets without hesitation."
 diggy_dungeons.813.a:0 "We need to get around"

 diggy_dungeons.814.t:0 "Empty Promises\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.814.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Much to our dismay whoever left this campsite took everything with them. Only the ragged tents remain now. Nothing could be found, even turning the rocks around and digging under the tents could reveal anything. Gruntled, the soldiers got back into formation and marched onwards, complaining about the fruitless search for days."
 diggy_dungeons.814.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Upon further inspection a pathway revealed itself behind the waterfall, leading around it towards a small cave filled with crates and chests. This immediately got our senses for treasure tingling and without much ado, the crates and chests were opened. Much to our dismay, however, they were all empty. All except one which housed the skeletal remains of a rat. After the initial euphoria of the promise of loot, this result was not well received by the expedition and with low spirits, they continued their journey."
 diggy_dungeons.814.a:0 "Unfortunate, but we need to go on"

 diggy_dungeons.815.t:0 "Hidden Riches\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.815.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Luckily for us the waterfall posed not only an obstacle, but also concealed its own demise: A ledge behind the water leads under and around, and, even better, reveals a stash of crates and chests that eagerly wait to be opened. Without much ado the soldiers take out their crowbars and burst them open, revealing glittering gold and gems. They throw their arms into the air upon seeing the successful result of their discovery and quickly fill our coffers with the acquired loot."
 diggy_dungeons.815.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Whoever left the tents also left their belongings here. Bags with coins, riches hidden beneath the tents, a great display of treasure. This find immediately invigorated our soldiers who long to get paid for their services with the very gold they had just found lying around here."
 diggy_dungeons.815.a:0 "This is great!"

 diggy_dungeons.816.t:0 "Structures, Taken By Time\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.816.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At last we have reached the bottom of the chasm. For months we have scaled the walls, and rested on ledges and terraces, but now we have solid ground under our feet again. We can feel the heat emanating from the very stone here, it is hot and wet, steam blowing from tiny vents into the chasm. After a short break, the expedition leader assesses the situation. Scouts report that there seem to be some man-made structures ahead, rubble and broken walls.\n\nWhen we arrived we could see the full extent of the ruins. In what must have once been a temple complex of some kind with broken columns and scattered windows lies old artefacts of old, strange trinkets and provenance that might give a hint as to what has happened down here."
 diggy_dungeons.816.a:0 "Temple complex? I find it rather simple…"

 diggy_dungeons.817.t:0 "Ancient Remnants\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.817.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the centre of the temple, hidden under stone and dust, lies the coffers of those who once directed believers. The priests must have collected liberal tithes because the gold amassed under the altar is a considerable amount. Strange faces and figures adorn the coins, with the most valuable having a worm or slug-like creature with an oversized head on its face."
 diggy_dungeons.817.a:0 "Weird, but okay"

 diggy_dungeons.818.t:0 "An Unwelcome Surprise\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.818.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we search through the temple we are suddenly surprised by a group of ghostly apparitions hovering menacingly towards us. Their faceless heads scream without mouths, their wailing cry penetrates flesh and bone."
 diggy_dungeons.818.a:0 "They have no voice to cry suffering"

 diggy_dungeons.819.t:0 "In The Depths\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.819.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]So we have arrived at the deepest point we could find. A barren place, yet still, someone - or something - had built a livelihood here. The temple shows signs of sophisticated craftsmanship. Whatever might be here, it will take more time to discover it. For now we must return what we have found and chart a safe way down for the future."
 diggy_dungeons.819.a:0 "This is just the beginning"

 diggy_dungeons.820.t:0 "An Icy Cache\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.820.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The ghastly apparitions flew towards us, their icy breath taking us by surprise. Yet they seem to be weak, their influence upon us barely noticeable. Through some they passed their ethereal bodies, creating a faint layer of ice on the skin through which they went. Those who had multiple ghosts go through them would not stand up again, but in the end, the wraiths disappeared. In their place lay now icy crystals glittering in the torchlight. They are cold to the touch and don't seem to warm up and don't melt, a fascinating and, most likely, valuable discovery."
 diggy_dungeons.820.a:0 "Be banished, foul fiends"

 diggy_dungeons.821.t:0 "The Wraiths Wrath\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.821.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The wraiths descended upon the men, their icy bodies passing through us like a hot knife through butter. Many fell to the ground, their breathing hard and staggered, their skin blue and cold. The apparitions would make some more passes over and through us but then disperse again. Some of those who fell stood up once more, their flesh returning to normal, but others had gone too far into the ice, their eyes of horror frozen in place for eternity."
 diggy_dungeons.821.a:0 "May they rest in peace"

 diggy_dungeons.822.t:0 "At Rock Bottom\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.822.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After an adventurous descent the time has come to understand what this chasm has to offer for us. Its promises are grand, and the allure of forgotten treasure drives the soldiers ever forward through the winding branches of this monument to nature's ingenuity. But even here the shaping hand is drawing its tracks through the dust of time. An ancient temple had been uncovered, an unmistakable sign that even down here there once were beings of sapience. What this means for us now is uncertain: Will we encounter whoever has made these structures or will the teeth of time have consumed everything and everyone by now?"
 diggy_dungeons.822.a:0 "Then let us go"

 diggy_dungeons.823.t:0 "Slimy Roots\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.823.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Walking along the paths carved out by time and nature yields many different sights into the very structure of what surrounds us, what we live in. Here we can see the sediments of ages past, relics of times immemorial, from before any life walked the surface of Halann.\n\nBesides rock, however, there is also some plant life to be found down here. One of the most extraordinary specimens is a slimy root that pulses with a violet glow. Many are wary of it at first, but after one daring cook has tried it his mood lightens up. He plucks more out of the ground and distributes it, soon most of the expedition has their hands on the nourishing and invigorating plant."
 diggy_dungeons.823.a:0 "How tasty!"

 diggy_dungeons.824.t:0 "Rush to the Rocks\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.824.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The hostile environment of the chasm is by now well documented. Nobody questions anymore whether we would be able to safely traverse this region - the answer is no. Even now the very rock pitches itself against us, throwing whatever is at nature's hand against us. In a manic rush, the soldiers dash out of the way of an avalanche, falling rocks that would crush our very bones to pieces if we were to be subject to its thundering descent. Still, not everyone managed to outrun the rocks, some were buried under their grey uniformity. A tragic loss, a terrible omen to the beginning of our journey in the dark."
 diggy_dungeons.824.a:0 "We must not stop"

 diggy_dungeons.825.t:0 "Labyrinth\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.825.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We were ready for many things down here in the dark, but not this.\n\nBefore us are walls. Walls shaped by a knowing hand into the confines of a labyrinth. Its yawning opening beckons us inside, but fear has us stay out for now. Stories of fiendish presence in labyrinths are not unknown to us, and if there be any labyrinth that could house such a hellish abomination, why it would be this one, wouldn't it?\n\nBut there is another possibility. The walls reach high, yes, but not too high for our grappling hooks to reach the edge. We could, possibly, climb up the walls and traverse the labyrinth outside of its many walls."
 diggy_dungeons.825.a:0 "Try to climb up the wall"
 diggy_dungeons.825.b:0 "Enter the accursed structure"

 diggy_dungeons.826.t:0 "Crossing\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.826.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We have entered the labyrinth and are soon confronted with our first of many terrible decisions. The path before us divides itself in twain, one going onwards, the other going to the right. Where shall we proceed?"
 diggy_dungeons.826.a:0 "Straightforward"
 diggy_dungeons.826.b:0 "Right is right"

 diggy_dungeons.827.t:0 "On The Wall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.827.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With rope, grappling hook and climbing claws we have managed to secure a way up the wall and now stand on its top. From here we can see how impossibly far the labyrinth reaches into the dark, a gigantic structure of mesmerizing complexity."
 diggy_dungeons.827.a:0 "Look at the few from up here!"

 diggy_dungeons.828.t:0 "Smooth Walls\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.828.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]No matter how often we try, the grappling hooks just won't stay on the wall. Even with pitons, we can not make any progress, the wall resists all of our efforts to scale it. This means that, unfortunately, we have to submit to the labyrinth itself and hope that we will emerge again on the other side…"
 diggy_dungeons.828.a:0 "Terrifying"

 diggy_dungeons.829.t:0 "Waining Walls\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.829.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The path ahead was clear and straight, without any major problems. Only after some time did the walls of the labyrinth reveal cracks, and after the next corner, the passage was closed.\n\nThis did not stop us, with pickaxes we started demolishing the wall next to us. With the wall removed, we continued onwards into the next corridor. Strangely enough, some kind of hoarding creature must have made its lair here, for gold and gems lay strewn across the floor."
 diggy_dungeons.829.a:0 "You're sure this isn't a dragon, right?"

 diggy_dungeons.830.t:0 "Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.830.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The path straight ahead turned into a snaking mess, with rounded corners everywhere. Soon none of the soldiers had any idea anymore where they were when suddenly Peebles started raining from above. A quick glance upwards revealed the terrifying fate that was coming for theme: Rocks and boulders have dislodged themselves from the ceiling, now in free fall headed for us."
 diggy_dungeons.830.a:0 "Duck! Run!"

 diggy_dungeons.831.t:0 "Empty Halls\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.831.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Thanks to our scouts we noticed the cluster of ghosts before we ran into their lair. With the danger identified we could prepare a proper answer to it, which resulted in just taking another path away from them. While some were aching for a fight, it was generally accepted as a good idea to just evade."
 diggy_dungeons.831.a:0 "Very good"

 diggy_dungeons.832.t:0 "Who Are We Going to Call?\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.832.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The path to the right had shown no particularly interesting features until a cold breeze, like an icy storm, made its way into the corridor. With the air came a torrent of ghosts, a threatening display of grim morbidity, their ethereal visages display a hatred for the living and breathing. Their airborne nature assists them in their endeavour - they move through the airways and freeze us over until they suddenly vanish into the darkness again."
 diggy_dungeons.832.a:0 "Ghostbusters!"

 diggy_dungeons.833.t:0 "On The Walls\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.833.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We followed the walls for a long time. At some point we became aware that we had not escaped the labyrinth - we had entered an inverted facsimile of it. The only advantage was that it was laid out plain in front of us.\n\nEventually a strange sight offered itself to us. In the distance stood a tower built atop the walls of the labyrinth, a rounded structure with a crooked roof. Spiderwebs filled the window frames and a hefty door sealed its insides off from us with nothing but a rusty lock preventing us from opening the door. With these two ways of entrance laid out before us, which should we choose?"
 diggy_dungeons.833.a:0 "Through the window"
 diggy_dungeons.833.b:0 "Pick the lock"

 diggy_dungeons.834.t:0 "Runic Plinth\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.834.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The cave-like structure we have found contains a stone altar, a grey slab of uncaring stone topped with remnants of woven cloth, its colour long departed and its weave on the verge of ruin. At its base, however, chiselled runes have survived the test of time and seem to be waiting for a learned mind to decipher them\n\nOn the other hand, there are stairs leading out of the chamber and further along our path of adventure."
 diggy_dungeons.834.a:0 "Go up the stairs"
 diggy_dungeons.834.b:0 "Translate"

 diggy_dungeons.835.t:0 "Diocese of the Deep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.835.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It seems as if all paths led to this place. Arranged in an almost star-shaped pattern many corridors and paths from the labyrinth end up here, at this temple structure. The first building is some kind of chapel, a high arching structure with stained glass window, but the inside is less promising. Although clearly connected to the other buildings around, the chapel has no obvious way to get deeper into the structure, the only door is locked and barred from the other side.\n\nAnother option, however, would be to drill a hole into the wall and try to get access to other parts that way, which could, potentially, be safer if we use the right tools. The door would require brute strength and the structural integrity of the doorframe and surrounding wall seems strange"
 diggy_dungeons.835.a:0 "Break the door open"
 diggy_dungeons.835.b:0 "Drill through the wall"

 diggy_dungeons.836.t:0 "Down, Down, Down\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.836.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The rusted window gave us no quarter, and in a desperate attempt to break it open some of the men fell down into the labyrinth. Then the window itself broke out of the tower, sending the very rocks that made up that part of the wall flying to the ground. In that torrent of material many more got swept down into the labyrinth until it was unfeasible to go on above the walls. At last, the remaining soldiers climbed down into the labyrinthian confines and the expedition continued onwards."
 diggy_dungeons.836.a:0 "Oh well…"

 diggy_dungeons.837.t:0 "Locked Out\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.837.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Neither door nor lock give way to our expedition. No matter how often we try, how many lockpicks sacrifice themselves, the lock is too rusted over to gain entry. The door itself is also too strong for us, behind a layer of wood is solid iron. Frustrated, the expedition discusses what to do next. It seems that the only possible solution is to go down into the labyrinth and continue the journey there."
 diggy_dungeons.837.a:0 "Urgh, I wanted to avoid that"

 diggy_dungeons.838.t:0 "Innards, Golden and Glittering\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.838.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the window open we can enter the tower. There two things become immediately apparent: There is gold in here, and no other exit. The gold excites the soldiers, but the prospect of having to climb into the labyrinth is a sobering truth following the auric rush. But, in the end, everyone agrees it is the best (or, to be truthful, the only) option for us."
 diggy_dungeons.838.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The lock turns, the door opens. Behind the threshold lies the treasures of past inhabitants: Jewellery and exotic tools, all of significant value to the interested buyer.\n\nIn a more depressing matter: the tower leads nowhere, the only path is down into the labyrinth. But, in the end, everyone agrees it is the best (or, to be truthful, the only) option for us."
 diggy_dungeons.838.a:0 "Continuation is paramount"

 diggy_dungeons.839.t:0 "Lingthusiasm\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.839.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The runes tell a strange tale of a mythical creature called Gorub, who has founded a settlement deep in this chasm. Following its death, followers of this being have erected temples and churches in its name, praying to it as a local god. Only one passage poses difficulty to our linguist: A verb, the sentence of which can only be translated as "And then he, high and grand, gorbed us in his great image"."
 diggy_dungeons.839.a:0 "Fascinating"

 diggy_dungeons.840.t:0 "Gibberish\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.840.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After a few hours the linguist surrenders. She stands up and looks around. "This is absolute nonsense, nothing about this makes any sense. The entire thing is gibberish, at some point the text claims of people being 'gorbed', whatever that is supposed to mean.""

 diggy_dungeons.841.t:0 "The Path Ahead\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.841.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Thanks to our strength and efficient application of force the door soon yields and the threshold opens up before us. Within the dark we see a room of untapped potential, untapped golden treasures and strange pieces of artwork, indescribable, but valuable."
 diggy_dungeons.841.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The supporting pillars erected to keep the wall from falling seem to do their job well. Soon there is a decently sized hole in the wall, through which our expedition can continue. Even better, the rock concealed a stash of gold laid in a hoard by ancient priests. Presumably."
 diggy_dungeons.841.a:0 "Brilliant!"

 diggy_dungeons.842.t:0 "Structural Un-Integrity\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.842.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The door flew wide open, but without the supporting structure, the wall itself gave in and broke apart, burying some of our men with it. The thunderous boulders smashed through other parts of the structure as well, creating a gaping hole in the floor. Through this hole, however, we can gleam a hidden stash of treasure amidst the rubble."
 diggy_dungeons.842.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite our best efforts the wall crumbled to pieces and broke down. In the torrent of rocks, many soldiers and workers got buried or smashed to pieces. The end, when the dust settles, reveals the true extent of the damage The path is clear, yes, but at what price? In other news, the rocks have revealed a stash of gold hidden behind the wall"
 diggy_dungeons.842.a:0 "At least it is some recompensation"

 diggy_dungeons.843.t:0 "A Church?\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.843.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Following our adventure at the tower we have come to a high-spired building that seems to be part of a church or some similar place of worship. It feels strangely out of place in the labyrinth, but the explorers are eager for the new challenge ahead.\n\nThe interior of the building is in a state of disrepair, parts of the ceiling had broken away and buried the room in rubble, which makes advancing through it a difficult task. Eventually, the rubble becomes too obnoxious to just pass over it, and it has to be carried away."
 diggy_dungeons.843.a:0 "Well, then get to it"

 diggy_dungeons.844.t:0 "Grand Hall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.844.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]This room is large and circular, a great banquet hall with old tables. One can imagine the livelihood of this place, but something feels amiss. The tables, the chairs, the walls, there is a strange air to them all.\n\nThe path ahead is blocked by another barricaded door, this time large boulders are keeping us away from continuing our journey. They are the size of horses or rothé, which will make this an arduous task to put them away."

 diggy_dungeons.845.t:0 "Rubble: Removed\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.845.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The work with the rubble continues surprisingly fast and soon most of the boulders are away. The floor revealed is beautiful, intricate tile work hidden beneath the crude rock."

 diggy_dungeons.846.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The soldiers were initially high-spirited, but after hours and hours of work, they start getting annoyed. It seems as if they are making no progress at all, that they are mindlessly toiling away at a never-ending task."

 diggy_dungeons.847.t:0 "Door Unhinged\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.847.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The door and the barricades proved no big problem to us, the only thing it took us was a bit of time and strength, but nothing we can't make up again. In fact, now that we are approaching the centre of this structure the soldiers get more and more excited for what is to come, what secrets they might unveil next."

 diggy_dungeons.848.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we were working on removing the barricades, suddenly the statues lining the walls began moving. Their eyes gleamed deep red, their granite weapons bent on removing the intruders, us, from the premises in one way or another. They approach us, their steps echoing through the hall and point spear and blade towards us.\n\nIn any other situation we would have easily defeated the golems, but for the work most people have laid down their weaponry, not expecting an attack. In the rough scramble to arms many were already cut down by the enemy, and only after some time did we manage to gain an advantage.\n\nEventually the golems were all destroyed, their rocks now the rubble preventing us from going further…"

 diggy_dungeons.849.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At last we have reached the centre of this place, the locus from where the strange presence we have felt emanates. The inner sanctum of the church is furnished with exquisite pillars of intricate design, the altar is a true mason's beauty and the statue behind is large, imposing, yet aloof and oddly spiritual.\n\nIt depicts a worm-like creature surrounded by two fluted columns that curl inwards. At the worm's end lies the head, the shape of a broad cake slice, two small, beady eyes at the lower corner and elegantly snaking patterns growing to the edges. At the base, it tells its name: "The Ascended One", an oddly fitting title since where else would one go from here? It is not possible to go deeper, up is the only direction.\n\nThen, suddenly, a laugh echoes through the chamber. From the statue exits a laughing ghost in the very image of the eidolon it was contained in. It yells "Ascend! Ascend! Ascend!", before grabbing, or rather, incorporating the treasures piled high on the altar and flies away into the dark. "

 diggy_dungeons.851.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the secrets of the chasm mostly uncovered it is now time to finish our business here. The ghost is still at large, harassing our soldiers here and there. We need to deal with it properly, or it might haunt other places as well. A new force was assembled to follow its ectoplasmic footsteps up the wall. "It is imperative," the officials say, "that this nuisance is dealt with!""

 diggy_dungeons.853.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In an erratic dash towards the ghost flying up the wall the soldiers start slipping on small stones and pebbles, stumbling along the slopes, all in all slowing down the entire expedition.

 diggy_dungeons.854.t:0 "Cutting It Close?\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.854.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A decision suddenly manifests itself in front of us. The ghost, in his dastardly annoyance, flies along a manyfold edge that rises and falls along the wall. At the same time, there is another way along the wall that looks to be much more direct, a shortcut with which we could gain on him, but it is uncertain how the path will continue later."
 diggy_dungeons.854.a:0 "Let's be safe and follow him directly"
 diggy_dungeons.854.b:0 "We need every advantage we can get - take the shortcut"

 diggy_dungeons.856.t:0 "Cutting it Close: Cut Off\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.856.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The ghost has a distinct advantage, that being his ability to fly. While we have to take strange, winding paths through the rock, it can just fly up ahead, unbothered by the surrounding geology.\n\nOnly sometimes do we get a nice stretch where we can start gaining on him, but he is slowly slipping away, his laughter fading into the dark and stale air. At some point, this is the only thing we have left of him to follow, a difficult trace as echo and wall try to confuse us."

 diggy_dungeons.858.t:0 "Cutting It Close: Clear Paths\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.858.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We run around the corner and there is nothing. The shortcut has led to a big, gaping hole with the ghost nowhere to be seen. Just as the soldier's desperation almost got the better of them, the mocking laughter could be heard again, echoing around the chasm.

 diggy_dungeons.859.t:0 "The Chase Continues\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.859.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The ghost is visible in the middle distance, making its way to a passage in the rocks. While we could simply run after it, we also have the option of bombing the support beams in order to collapse the ceiling and cut off the passage."

 diggy_dungeons.860.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we follow the ghost on its noncorporeal heels, we come upon a deep cliff. The ghost simply floats across the depths, but we will have to make use of the ancient-looking rope bridge spanning between the two sides."
 diggy_dungeons.860.a:0 "Walk carefully… but quickly."

 diggy_dungeons.861.t:0 "Lookout\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.861.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Having lost sight of the ghost, we quickly send some scouts to some higher places, hoping to still catch a glimpse of the thing. If we don't find it soon, we might not find it again, as it doesn't exactly leave tracks."

 diggy_dungeons.863.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With several successful explosions, a part of the ceiling collapses, closing off the passageway the ghost was approaching. It is forced to turn back to a different exit, allowing us to make up some of the distance in the meantime. As we go after it, though, the ceiling continues to crumble. As we reach the passageway, the rest of the ceiling collapses, killing the last few expedition members who had fallen behind."

 diggy_dungeons.864.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we try our best to keep pace with the ghost, our stamina is starting to give out. As we reach the passageway, panting and gasping for breath, the ghost is already nowhere to be seen anymore. We appear to have lost it."

 diggy_dungeons.865.t:0 "Across the Chasm\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.865.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With swift but careful steps, we quickly make it across the rope bridge. While certainly not as fast as the ghost, it was fast enough to keep it in sight, and continue the pursuit."
 diggy_dungeons.865.a:0 "Onwards!"

 diggy_dungeons.866.t:0 "Old Infrastructure\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.866.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With swift but careful steps, we quickly make it across the rope bridge. As the final few attempt to cross, however, the old ropes begin to snap. Several expeditionaries fall into the depths screaming, but we do not have time to look back lest the ghost gets away."

 diggy_dungeons.867.t:0 "Without a Trace\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"

 diggy_dungeons.868.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]To our great surprise, in front of us is a stairway that leads just up and ahead. An easy situation for our tired explorers, the stairs promise ease of use and a quick pursuit, a welcome exception to the arduous hunt so far. The rock itself is sturdy, the wall serves as a safe railing against which to hold, and the slopes are just good enough to promise safe steps."
 diggy_dungeons.868.a:0 "How convenient"

 diggy_dungeons.869.t:0 "At Road's Fork\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.869.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the cliff well behind us and the guest well before us we come to a crossroads.

Disheartened, but not willing to give up, the expeditionairies run for their lives to maybe catch the last glimpse of where the ghost might be headed next. Then, suddenly, the stairs stop. The expedition has reached the top."
 diggy_dungeons.870.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]During the hard climb we start to lose sight of the ghost, its ethereal form vanishing into unknown territory. Without much choice, we continue onwards, up and up, until suddenly the wall stops. In its place is a wide cavern. We have reached the top"
 diggy_dungeons.870.a:0 "Quick, we can't lose him now!"

 diggy_dungeons.871.t:0 "Ghost Ahead\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.871.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we had wished, the stairs have not forsaken us. After a calm yet urgent walk, we can see the top of the chasm coming up ahead of us. After months in the deep, the promise of a return to ground level has the expedition excited, a grand prospect of victory.\n\nWith the cliff crested and conquered we can see the ghost just ahead of us, pestering others for a change. But it means that our business is close to ending, the enemy is in plain sight."
 diggy_dungeons.871.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The climb was hard, but at last, we have crested the cliff and emerged on top of the chasm. Whether it be true or just a tick of the mind, the air seems fresher and more invigorating here.

 diggy_dungeons.872.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At last we reach the summit, the highest point in the wall.

 diggy_dungeons.873.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Spells, swords, shields, and awards are readied against the ghost as it dives down and conjures spikes of silvery-white energy that he launches in circular patterns around it. These spikes pierce body and plate, they skewer us in many ways, but the ghost, Gorub, is not invincible. Slowly his form fades away and his voice grows weaker. In an act of desperation, it launches more and more spikes, but eventually, it runs out. With a last, desperate "aaascend…" it vanishes into thin air and leaves the package of gold behind."

 diggy_dungeons.874.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our weapons are no match against the power of this ghost.

 diggy_dungeons.900.d:0 "After months of relentless exploration, our expedition finally reached what seemed to be the end of their current endeavor. However, perhaps based on a whim or some sort of deeply honed intuition, the expedition's leader decided to push forward through one last unassuming tunnel. As they pressed forward, the tunnel widened, revealing a massive cave network, with tunnels spreading to all directions. And at the center of this network, an awe-inspiring sight: the entrance to a massive cave, a solemn cathedral in the belly of the earth, glistening stalactites hanging like chandeliers.\n\nYet, the grandeur was juxtaposed by a sense of unease. A thick shroud of cobwebs draped the entrance, a testament to time's passage and nature's reclamation. Yet a faint, acrid scent, akin to bile rising from a stomach, implied some life still remained in this desolate space. Like gossamer veils, the cobwebs hinted at the perils within..."

And hiding behind these webs, creeping through the floors and walls, the flickering torch light reveals swarms of spiders. These arachnids, ranging from the smallest pin-head sized crawlies to cat sized beasts quickly flee the luminance, but the knowledge of their presence causes many members of our expedition severe discomfort\n\nUpon the chamber itself, a path forward is clear through a tunnel in the far cave wall. However, some slight clues like unusual cobweb patterns seem to hint that previous expeditions may have been here in the far past.

While their appearance causes revulsion in many of our explorers, who immediately reach for their weapons, these beasts don't seem to be immediately aggressive towards us. In fact, they even seem interested in our presence, cautiously - and even gently - reaching out their feelers towards our food supplies.

 diggy_dungeons.923.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Clearing the webbing to clear our path hasn't been easy, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Or rather, in the middle of it. While removing some of the cobwebs closest to the walls, the gleam of our torchlight reflected on something shiny, and looking into it, it seems like someone left a small pile of treasure inside a nook in the wall."

 diggy_dungeons.924.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Burning the webbing has proven to be very effective. A bit too effective perhaps. While the fumes from the burning silk was something we already sort of expected, we did not foresee that some of the webbing would take such a long time to flare up. So now that we're traversing the tunnel, several several pockets of web are spontaneously catching fire and grievously wounding our men."

 diggy_dungeons.925.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Trusting the silk to bear our weight, the expedition began heading over the chasm on the web. However, about halfway through, the worst happens: Rather than the rope itself snapping, the web seems to unstick itself from the places it was anchored. All those on the bridge at the time fall to their death screaming. And as if that wasn't enough, it seems like the screaming has called something up from the chasm, and now shuffling and scraping noises are being heard coming from the depths."

 diggy_dungeons.926.t:0 "Crossing the Chasm\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.926.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Trusting the webbing to take our weight, we head over the chasm. Part-way over the crevasse, we find a few valuables - possibly remains from previous expeditions - embedded into the rope. Thankfully taking them out doesn't affect the stability of the web, so we're able to get the valuables and get to safety"
 diggy_dungeons.926.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Building our own bridge to cross the chasm takes a while, but with the additional security of a sure footing, we're able to pay better attention to our surroundings. Thus, during the crossing, we're able to spot plenty of valuables stuck within the silk of the webbing across the chasm. Once we cross the chasm on our safe bridge, it's trivially easy to chop the web and drag it to one side to collect the valuables."

However, as work progresses we hear more and more sounds coming from below. We first think we're hearing echoes, but as we draw closer to finishing the bridge, we realize the noises aren't like anything we're doing. By the time we finish the bridge and start ferrying the expedition through, we realize our noise while building the bridge attracted... something from the depths. Calling them spiders would be misleading to say the least, but we're lucky to make it through the tunnel on the other end with minimal casualties."

However, our way forwards is blocked off: A solid curtain of silk cuts the cavern in half, preventing our progress and stopping us from viewing the other side. Our blades don't seem to be enough to cut through this white wall, so our options to go onwards are limited, however this seems like a good spot to set up camp and think of the next steps of our expedition"

 diggy_dungeons.929.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay] Our expedition finds itself in a cavern of truly staggering scale. Despite the immensity of the cave, what catches the eye is not the high shadows of the cavern roof above, but a colossal wall of woven spiderweb spanning the entirety of the cave. After some hasty experimentation, it appears that the silken barrier is strong enough to repel most of our attempts to cut a way through. Using a combination of magic and enchanted weapons, we were able to—after much effort—make the beginnings of an opening, but some of our explorers believe that a well-stoked flame could provide a quicker way through the wall."

The first few minutes of burning go on without much issue, but after a while many expeditionaries seem to be getting dizzy and short of breath. By the time we realize the fumes from the webs are causing us harm, a significant portion of the expeditionary party has passed out or gone into coughing fits, several among our number even left completely incapacitated by the damage to our lungs."

The burning goes on mostly without issue; though the fumes seem to cause coughing and lightheadedness in some of our explorers, we're able to keep the fire in check enough to limit the smoke. When the way is cleared, we can see some mostly destroyed trinkets scattered amongst the ashes, probably the remains of previous expeditions not as fortunate as our own. Whatever their origin, they may still be worth something."

Progress has been slow, and we are finding all manner of things hidden within the webbing, most of them harmful. From sacs of spider eggs being breached and covering our cutters with hatchlings to pockets of acid containing half—or fully—dissolved prey, cutting our way through is proving itself a more dangerous task than expected. Thankfully, the way forward seems to be almost clear."

 diggy_dungeons.933.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Though the process of cutting through the webbing is nothing if not slow, we've found plenty of reasons to keep going.

By the time we emerge on the other side of the web our bags are weighed down with our plunder."

 diggy_dungeons.934.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the wall of web no longer blocking our path, we're able to proceed onwards into the mouth of a winding tunnel. As soon as we enter the tunnel however, we're attacked from behind, ambushed by a group of massive spiders. Each arachnid is taller than a dwarf in its own right, their spiked carapaces gleaming with an almost metallic sheen."

 diggy_dungeons.935.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Cutting our way through the wall of web reveals a tunnel at the other end of the cavern. It is seemingly not the only path forward however, for our sharp-eyed scouts point out a smaller tunnel near the roof of the cave, the entrance near a rocky protrusion connected to the remnants of the silken wall. Climbing up to it using the webbing should be possible, but the entrance we cut may have weakened its structure to a breaking point."

Though our losses were not insignificant, perhaps we could avoid further casualties if we made use of the spiders' odd metallic exoskeletons..."

It's simply there one moment, swaying slightly as our forces make their careful ascent, then gone the next. The web wall snaps, tearing free in a shower of silk and flailing bodies. It seems our cut in the web must have weakened it on a structural level, not that knowing that is any consolation to those dead from the collapse."

Something still seems off, however, and our worries are vindicated when one of the scouts comes forward with a concerned look on his face. He tells us that behavior like this for the kind of spiders they caught is far from normal, and the only thing that would cause them to move en masse like that is fear.

Then, following it around the bend in the tunnel, the storm arrives. Hundreds of thousands of chittering black bodies barrel down the tunnel towards us, a living arachnid tide thundering at our ranks with the force of a tidal wave. The roaring returns all at once, crashing down upon our eardrums with all the force of sudden thunder, accompanied by the eerie rushing of stale air as it's shunted in front of the wall of spiders like a bow wave before a great ship.

 diggy_dungeons.1015.d.3:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Beaten, bruised, and exhausted, with neither magic nor sheer force proving useful in taming the beast, we decide to turn to a different strategy: Not subduing or forcing Yidab to work with us, but convince her of how we may help each other. Armed then not with weapons, but with the remains of our dwindling supplies, we attempt to coax the giant spider into an alliance. \n\n The air is thick with weariness on both sides, and the soldiers, as battered as Yidab, understand the necessity of forging an unconventional bond. The scent of provisions mingles with the acrid remnants of venom as the soldiers extend an olive branch in the form of sustenance. Yidab, weakened and no longer solely driven by aggression, tentatively accepts the offering. As the soldiers continue to share their meager supplies, a fragile understanding emerges. The once-hostile creature, now satiated and somewhat appeased, contemplates an unforeseen alliance. In this weary truce, the soldiers find a glimmer of hope, turning the cavern from a battleground into a peculiar sanctuary where the aroma of shared meals replaces the lingering stench of conflict.\n\nThough the path here was hard, we truly believe we've been able to find a compromise and bring Yidab into our control." #food

Though we're not sure what exactly she may do as she wraps herself in her webs, we will keep alert to what is certainly some sort of ploy.\n\nAs more and more time passes, we begin to wonder if Yidab is not just taking a rest, but the possibility of this being some sort of trick to get us to lower our guard or attack is too high, so we keep alert\n\nFinally, after what seems like minutes, Yidab comes out of her cocoon. While we were ready for anything she might throw our way, we were not expecting her to yawn and continue the fight as if nothing had happened. She WAS just taking a rest!"

However, we quickly realize the webbing around her is a lot more protective than we had expected, and actually poses us a fairly large risk in the form of sticking. Despite this, thinking back to our previous encounters with webs, we found a way to turn this situation to our advantage...\n\nUsing some of the oil we had in stock, we douse the webs in flammable material and light it on fire. Yidab desperately crawls her way out of her cocoon, and though we had to waste some resources, her rage proves we were able to hurt her."

Acting quickly, we're able to fashion out some improvised earplugs out of some of our supplies, and just in time for Yidab to release a massive sound wave through her string, shaking even our organs, but mostly keeping our eardrums safe.\n\nWe should probably remove these earplugs from our ears before returning to battle"

Worse still, our proximity to Yidab means that the string she had stretched, which turned out to be her attempt at using sound to harm us, ended up being much more effective, actively causing internal damage to some of our soldiers."
