 high_philosophy_events.0.d:0 "We have recently seen the wisdom of the philosophers of Rahen. Their insight in the best way to live our lives and society, so that we might ascend to the heights of the high gods, is clearly of vital importance. However now that we have joined their ranks of philosophers, it's clear that, among their ways of thought, they are also quite divided as to what certain key reliefs and friezes mean that have been found in the High Temples. Several different schools of learning have appeared at our court. To whom should we turn for their wisdom?"

Once the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would have gone years between visits, but ever since the scholar from the Ascendant Soul school arrived in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court this had become a regular journey. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] disembarked and entered the temple complex. Its central tower rose high into the sky, and it was surrounded by sturdy walls which sheltered various smaller structures.\n\nThe scholar interrupted the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s marveling and bid them welcome. They brought [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the entrance of what appeared to be a small stone cellar. Inside, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was met with a large pit constructed like an old stepwell. The scholar lit a lantern and began to descend the stairs while beckoning [Root.Monarch.GetName] to follow. As they proceeded, the scholar spoke.\n\n“We have already spoken at length about the necessity of improving all aspects of yourself: the physical, mental, magical, and of course spiritual… but I fear you have not fully taken to heart the need to master power and have the wisdom to use it well. True you may command $COUNTRY$, but you do not yet control yourself. To truly achieve Purtara you must have the power to shape the world and the wisdom of the High Gods.”\n\nFinally the scholar reached the bottom, and moved the lantern to illuminate the southern wall. A carving took up the entirety of the wall, and depicted a scene of massive construction. Mountains were leveled, and the temple itself built from the remains of the former. All of this done by the High God Pathim with seemingly little effort, and massive fanfare of those below her. The scholar spoke once more.\n\n“Let us now sit in this old holy place, and meditate on this wisdom I speak of.”"

They danced precisely with the movement of the curtains, which in turn fluttered in accordance with the breeze. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was still asleep as the light began to creep towards their bed. As if on cue, the moment the light reached [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s face, a knock came upon the door, and the scholar cracked it open while facing away from the room.\n\nHe apologized, “Ah, I did not realize you were still asleep. However, it is the mathematically perfect time for another of my lessons.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] groaned, but gathered themself and donned a robe before bidding the scholar entrance. He walked into the room and motioned towards the silk curtains at the eastern end which separated the bedroom from the outdoor space. Moving the curtains aside, both walked out onto the circular balcony and looked upon $CAPITAL_CITY$.\n\nThe scholar began to lecture, “Below you are the people of your city. They move in accordance with their place, do they not? The bread maker brings his goods to the markets just as they open. The fires of the forge lit by the blacksmith as the sun first touches his brow. Even the traders move to and fro with the clockwork of the world. All in their place. All at their greatest potential. Even the city itself reflects the precise geometry of the High Temples through the route of its streets, and the angles of its structures.”\n\nThe scholar paused. “It is this that the temples speak most highly of: Order. To perpetuate it is the purest form of Kartya.” There was a longer pause as the two of them watched the city in motion. Finally, the scholar asked, “What do you believe your place is in the mechanism of the world?”"

 high_philosophy_events.6.d:0 "It was petition day within the court of $COUNTRY$. Peoples from all walks of life were allowed to come forth and speak to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. This often meant that [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat through petty squabbles over land markers, or who owned a particular goat. Today was not all that different. The next in line was a man of the lower caste, his hands covered in calluses, and his clothes barely held together. He knelt before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], and began to speak with trembling in his voice,\n\n“[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], I do not ask much of my superiors, but today I must beg for yours. My eldest boy is ill, but I cannot afford his medicine. I am only a simple farmer, and my wife has long since parted this world. Please, can you find it in your heart to help me?”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] considered waving the man aside, but decided against it. Maybe the Orange Sash school scholar really was having an impact upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] remembered the scholar speaking almost daily on the importance of familial harmony; on the significance of mirroring the High Gods and following your place in the family structure. Elders must provide for their offspring, who in turn should be obedient to their parents and grand-parents. Only once a family has achieved internal harmony can they begin to connect with other families in external harmony, and achieve Purtara.\n\nA tap on the shoulder brought [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] out of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reverie. An advisor leaned over and whispered, “Would you like me to get rid of him?”"

[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] eyes roamed across the golden lettering upon the page and darted from one exquisite marginalia to another. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] finished reading and, perplexed, requested an escort to the public bath house.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] recollected the events of the past couple months. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had invited a Silk Turban school scholar to $COUNTRY$ and given them free reign to roam the streets. Within weeks this decision seemed to achieve its ends exquisitely. The markets were full with previously unseen goods brought in by merchants from afar (who of course were obliged to pay a tax on imports). The newfound revenue quickly solved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s problems, and soon they turned their attention to other issues. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] thought that would be the end of the matter, but as they rounded the corner to the bath house, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] realized there was more to this scholar than a desire for wealth.\n\nThe baths were normally a quiet place, but today a swarm of workers enveloped the site. Masons worked to remove sections of old mud brick walls and replaced them with freshly cut granite. Artisans worked to refurbish frescos and tile mosaics, while drapers brought in smooth silk curtains and hung them in the windows. A smith placed gemstones and fine metals within the floor, while another man brought in golden hanging candelabras to place into new ceiling fixtures. The scholar emerged from the commotion with a merchant beside him and quickly approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The scholar spoke,\n\n“I see you received my companion’s missive. Good! Soon the baths of $CAPITAL_CITY$ will be the most magnificent emulation of the golden temple’s aesthetics! This man has embraced my teachings full heartedly and donated a significant portion of the funds for this project himself! It would seem your subjects are finally beginning to understand the importance of utilizing their wealth to enrich and uplift their community.”\n\nThe scholar smiled, “Purtara may finally be within their grasp.”\n\nWith jubilation, the merchant and the scholar departed. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood in shock. The scholar’s teachings truly seemed to be taking hold. What would this mean? This very well might… A page ran up beside the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]  and produced a letter with a golden seal. [Root.Monarch.GetName] began to read,"

 high_philosophy_events.8.d:0 "It was a rainy afternoon within $CAPITAL_CITY$ as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] entered the temple to join the session. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] faced the western window, in line with the others, and unfurled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rug. For a few moments silence washed over [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Then the Radiant Sun scholar began to lead the temple in ritual penance.\n\n“Unfortunately the sun does not grace us with its presence this afternoon. Yet let us not be lost in the darkness, but instead pay reverence to Digatha so she may lead us out of the storm. For while the rains fall about us, and thunder rolls in the distance, each of us is lost in our own storm - one of our own making.”\n\nThe scholar continued as the thunder grew ever closer to the city.\n\n“We have all strayed from our Nitikamarja. The nature of daily life ensures this. Yet, we can, as always, return to it once again. As the High Gods once worshiped, so shall we. Their ceremonies are our ceremonies, and through our faith and fervor we will be set upon the true path to Purtara. May the High Gods’ guidance touch all of you.”\n\nLightning came down in the distance as he exclaimed, “With the proclamation complete, it is time to do as the High Gods did once before. Present your offering to the flame, and cleanse yourself through its destruction.”\n\nOne by one people walked to the altar and brought objects to be devoured by the flaming basin. An elderly woman brought forth a fragment of pottery, and her husband brought a hammer. Each person here presented something to be absolved of, a mistaken deviation from their Nitikamarja that they wished to correct. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the last to make an offering and presented a spear tip, taken from a soldier who fell in battle against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] army. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] placed it in the flame a great bolt of lightning crashed to the ground a few meters from the temple grounds. The scholar grinned like a child and spoke once more,\n\n“The High Gods seem to be quite pleased with your offering.”"

All echelons of the court were present, from servants to administrators, and some of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s own family. Once [Root.Monarch.GetName] was sat within the circle, scholar Aahan produced a number of silk wrappings from his cloak and began to distribute them. The scholar then entered the center of the ring and spoke,\n\n"We have come far in our lessons. We have observed the celestial bodies, and I have shared knowledge of their hidden truths. We partook in herbal teas and debated our collective truths under the lamp-light. Yet those are only two of the three paths you must tread... I will now light the incense. I ask you to look upon it, fall into its swirling form, and when ready, don your blindfold." Then there was a pause. "Let us begin."\n\nAfter the Starry Eye Scholar arrived, caste agnostic events like this sprang up throughout [Root.Country.GetName]. Cities that had previously seen few devotees became hotspots overnight as the scholar taught new pupils of the hidden signs within celestial bodies and emphasized the three-fold path to enlightenment. He encouraged debate, discussion, and meditation, such that all could find the inner, group, and outer knowledge that are the core of the three-fold path.\n\nAs the last candles began to sputter, the incense cones finally died out. One by one people removed their blindfolds - having finished their meditation - and waited for all to look upon the dim wicks. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] opened [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes the scholar moved about the ring and asked everyone to share what they had learned over the past week. A page spoke fondly of the first lesson and a newfound understanding of the stars and their meanings. A diplomat enthusiastically described her experience partaking in debate and collective growth during the second lesson. Then a blacksmith remarked on the newfound self realization they have discovered in this third lesson. Other spoke of various truths, until finally, the scholar turned to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and asked,\n\n"What is it that you have learned?”"

It is through those facets that the High Gods made war - their greatest accomplishment - and ensured peace, prosperity, and monumentality - their second greatest accomplishment. One must strive to be strict yet generous with their clients, hawkishly protect their charges, and subsume their enemies. This is the Kartya most truthfully espoused by the High Gods and their temples.” - Sarika Mrudaya al Kamtarhid of the Unbroken Claw School\n\nThe scholar from the Unbroken Claw school read that passage inside [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s chambers, but it had resonated through the halls of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] home ever since. The reverberations passed into the countryside, to the petty lords and the army officers. Provincial governors cracked down on detractors and recruited local power holders into their patron-client relations. Mayors encouraged normal drilling of local militias, and the cities and towns under this new stricter rule prospered.\n\nToday a group of generals and lower ranking officers came before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They proclaimed that the banners swelled with new recruits and that it was time for war. At first [Root.Monarch.GetName] hesitated, and the gathered crowd grew rowdy. Some soldiers whispered complaints. Some spoke openly that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cared little for Pichka and only paid it lip service.  One irate general shouted that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] wished to prevent them from achieving Nitikamarja. At this claim, the Unbroken Claw Scholar, who stood beside them, held up a hand and interjected,\n\n“It is the will of the High Gods that these men display their prowess of arms, discipline, and of course strength, through battle. They are willing and ready to face your enemies and emerge victorious. One should not deny them the opportunity to achieve Purtara. What is your command?”\n\nThe military advisors and soldiers of the court looked to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] with stern faces; they nervously awaited [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] proclamation."

The hall was completely silent, but then a single attendant stood up and fearlessly asked: "If [debate_province.Religion.GetName] is so superior, why hasn't it produced anything as magnificent as the High Temples?" The professor opened his mouth, but found no words with which to answer. His face turned pale, his hands started shaking, and then he finally ran out of the hall, head buried in his palms in a desperate attempt to hold back his tears.
