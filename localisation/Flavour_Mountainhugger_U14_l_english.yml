  U14_secure_the_mountain_title:0 "Secure the Mountain"
  U14_secure_the_mountain_desc:0 "Dwarves, just like the ones our ancestors slew in Serpentspine from where we came, have existed in Bahar for a very long time. They are a greedy and frustrating race of smallfolk that lack our inherent ingenuity and sense of honor. It's time to drive them back into the depths where they belong."
  U14_dig_hole_title:0 "Digging a Hole"
  U14_dig_hole_desc:0 "The longbeards are conquered, and their hold is yet another fort left a pile of rubble in our wake. The copper walls the few remaining dwarves once treasured will be made into cannons, and their hole-obsessed selves will find great use in the mines that dot our great clan! The remaining dwarves of the hold can rest easy however, knowing their lives are now in our overseer's gnarled and warty hands."
  U14_two_races_one_hold_title:0 "Two Races, One Hold"
  U14_two_races_one_hold_desc:0 "Weeks have gone by since our conquest of the dwarves, and little has changed in the behavior of their kind towards our rule. They are rowdy, unaccommodating, and generally rude when forced to interact with our kinfolk. They have been relegated to their own little pockets of the hold by our overseers where they may mine in peace. The more patient ones have been given the freedom of serving as liaisons, traders, and freemen, allowed to operate within goblin depths.\n\nThe program has been a resounding success, and today marks the first instance of a goblin and dwarf not erupting into physical violence from a minor disagreement."
  U14_bahar_new_bankers_title:0 "Bahar's New Bankers"
  U14_bahar_new_bankers_desc:0 "Bahar banks have been dominated by our rivals, the insidious and greedy longbeards, ever since they arrived here. Their infrastructure was built to last the ages, and made in such a way that it masked their underhanded methods of generating wealth from the savings of their clientele. It all ends now. Today dawns the reign of a new Bahar, ruled by us, where dwarves no longer steal from the people of Bahar… we will!"
  U14_vilify_our_rivals_title:0 "Vilify Our Rivals"
  U14_vilify_our_rivals_desc:0 "Goblin promises are doubtful at best, and those made by our old clanboss were no different. Promises broke like our people when they stormed the walls of Bahar, and like his promises he was broken as well. His skull was crushed by Jenthib, and when he took power he made no promises to our kind detailing glorious victories or lands taken, he promised revenge."
  U14_across_the_fortress_title:0 "Across the Fortress"
  U14_across_the_fortress_desc:0 "Failure, oh how that word stings. We failed once in taking Azka-Szel-Azka, and now it remains as a disgusting monument to our miscalculations. Seeing the thing makes our troops shake and our generals tremble, but not in fear-no… rage. Seething, lava courses through veins, and drives our men to break stone with their bare fists. This pitiful bastion, this mortar reminder and its kin WILL fall by our hands, even if it takes a thousand goblins surging into its defenses to take it!"
  U14_old_fort_new_invaders_title:0 "Old Fort, New Invaders"
  U14_old_fort_new_invaders_desc:0 "Mountainhugger goblins do not get scared, they simply retreat tactically until an enemy is assessed in a way it can be dealt with (usually with shanks,) but several goblins stationed at a retaken fortress in the west have been made into scaredy little elves from some kind of threat. We must find whatever threat lies within and see if it needs a good shanking or not."
  U14_consolidate_west_bahar_title:0 "Consolidate West Bahar"
  U14_consolidate_west_bahar_desc:0 "Our victory was always meant to be, the first rung of losses were just a minor setback, a setback that never would’ve happened if our good-for-nothing kin had helped us out in the first place! They just think they're so superior just because they took sweet, shiny Aqatbar on their first try, pfeh!\n\nIt’s time to humble our dearest kinfolk, and show them who the real siegemasters are!"
  U14_true_newcomers_title:0 "True Newcomers"
  U14_true_newcomers_desc:0 "The petty fops that lived in Bahar before we arrived scoffed at our existence, saying that we are nothing but usurpers - newcomers that bear no right to rule the land. They are wrong. The true newest state is that of Crathanor, existing to do nothing but reign over their foolish people behind cowardly walls while stealing our distinction!\n\nIt will not be the case for long.”
  U14_reunite_west_title:0 "Reunite the Western Group"
  U14_reunite_west_desc:0 "Landsharkers were part of the same group as us when we invaded Bahar all those years ago. Which essentially means that we are the same, so why do they need someone else ruling them? Exactly. It's time for a little family reunion."
  U14_hugs:0 "Make Them Hug"
  U14_hugs_desc:0 "A venomous rivalry apparently exists between two cities in our borders called Crathaknob and Ru… Ryu… Roo- Whatever. They’re both petty, they’re both ugly, and they’re both going to learn that ceasing hostility between themselves is the only way they can guarantee ceased hostility FROM US."
  U14_from_rags_to_better_rags_title:0 "From Rags to Better Rags"
  U14_from_rags_to_better_rags_desc:0 "Decades ago our leaders were stationed at the precipice of our capital, living in humble huts and having to live with stinking, unwashed rags that shined beneath the purple light of violet gemstones. Now with our conquests, we have finally attained enough wealth to wash them!\n\nUnfortunately, those royal rags were somehow lost when handed over to the Greysheep clansmen we entrusted them with, and replaced with some rather gaudy looking things. They say it’s a fashion statement but, personally, I don’t get it."
  U14_back_to_ourdia_title:0 "Back to Ourdia
  U14_back_to_ourdia_desc:0 "Ourdia… Ourdia… Ourdia, OURDIA, OURDIA. OURDIA WILL BREAK BY OUR MIGHT, ITS WALLS WILL FALL, ITS BRICKS WILL TURN INTO POWDER, AND ITS PEOPLE WILL BE SLAUGHTERED!"
  U14_siege_weapons_title:0 "Siege Weapons?" #Suggestion: Iron Siren
  U14_siege_weapons_desc:0 "While sailing the waves off the coast of Bahar’s seas, our sailors were exposed to the wonders of the big water: sea sickness, monstrous creatures, and pirate raids. But greatest among those wonders lured them with a voice of beauty, coming in puffs and blasts from the side of a great wooden raft. Goblin eyes flocked from all sectors of the rudimentary raft we’d used on the voyage to gawk at the iron marvel that glared at them from across the waves, watching with glee as it sang a song of lead and gunpowder.\n\nThe only survivor from the expedition washed ashore on a log, the widest of smiles on his face and eyes wide as the sky above. And he spoke, with love, of an iron siren.“
  U14_reenact_the_siege_title:0 "Reenact the Siege"
  U14_reenact_the_siege_desc:0 "Though shakier than ever before, and painted with the colors of delinquents and spiteful soldiers alike, Ourdia - that giant, STUPID hunk of rock - is now ours.Taken by our men in droves, with thousands sacrificing themselves just to see it done… Something that would have been MUCH easier if we had guns like the ones we had now. Many in our ranks have suggested re-enacting the siege with modern technology, some have regarded this idea as stupid and a waste of money, everyone else who had a say in the decision was a goblin."
  U14_bane_of_forts_title:0 "Bane of Forts"
  U14_bane_of_forts_desc:0 "Years of literally crashing ourselves on stone walls and iron gates really teaches you a thing or twenty about the forts in the area. Sandstone walls are thick, but are as good as sand to a goblin sapper and his explosives. Iron gates with bars usually don’t account for goblin sizes, and when they do it’s as easy as pulling a few unnecessary ribs out to squeeze yourself through. And when all else fails - and even when successful - get a goblin engineer, give him a pile of gunpowder and see what he comes up with!"
  U14_finish_the_navy_title"0 "Finish the Navy"
  U14_finish_the_navy_desc:0 "The term ‘goblin navy’ is synonymous with ‘impossible dream’ in many provinces throughout Bahar, both owned by us and not. And it’s understandable why. What we have made, frankly, wouldn’t be worth chucking at a centaur’s tent. It’s embarrassing, and a wasted opportunity to apply our signature ingenuity. It might just be time to settle down for a bit and turn an impossible dream into reality."
  U14_green_privateers_title:0 "Green Privateer"
  U14_green_privateers_desc:0 "Ho - all to the beaches, Huggers, come down,\n\n
  With your rags made of sheepskin with patches of brown.\n\n
  With your ironclad caps and your ragskin boots come,\n\n
  To the gathering summons of Bahar-shore drum!\n\n\n\n
  
  Come down with your sling now; ‘cept those with the pox\n\n
  To what was once splinters of primitive docks.\n\n
  Let self rest in crewside, til your captain does call,\n\n
  ‘Thar’s two-legged game for your powder and ball!’\n\n\n\n
  
  And cheer, cheer, the Green Privateer!\n\n
  And cheer, cheer, the Green Privateer!"
  U14_gnollish_expertise_title:0 "Gnollish Expertise"
  U14_gnollish_expertise_desc:0 "It is with great effort and planning that we, after years of perfecting the art of the siege, have managed to finally create something that not only floats, but can actually sail without oars. This triumph however was quickly dashed when on our first voyage out into the big water, we were accosted by Gnolls that taught us quickly that our sailors were neither ship-shape, nor anywhere even close. If we are to get any sort of progress in cementing our rule of ALL of Bahar, we are going to need help from an unlikely ally."
  U14_the_glass_bid_title:0 "The Glass Bid"
  U14_the_glass_bid_desc:0 "The glass isles were host to a kingdom built around the figure of a grand reaver and his crew - a state built on plunder and pillage, two things that we can get behind. If it was possible in the past - established no doubt by kin that weren’t as inherently greedy as ours, who knows just what we could do with those isles in the hands of goblin greed?"
  U14_terror_of_divenhal_title:0 "Terror of the Divenhal"
  U14_terror_of_divenhal_desc:0 "For years uncountable the dogmen were the most reviled raiders in all the places that touched the seas. Their raids were legendary as they were brutal and unstoppable. And while they are formidable, with our combined efforts sailors have begun singing of a new threat - one that swims and crawls into your ship as your crewmates sleep and your captain has finally let weary eyes shut, one that finds that captain and sets them into a permanent slumber before their crew can wake up to a barrage of cannons on a rickety ship piloted by raiders brown and green alike.\n\nThe green privateer."

  #Events
  exodus_goblin_flavour.9.t:0 “Azka-szel-Azka”
  exodus_goblin_flavour.9.d:0 “Men with cloaked in hoods were found cornered within the tunnels of Azka-szel-Azka, no doubt the source of the weird noises and strange disappearances reported by our men in recent months. While most are clearly man-sized, some of the shorter ones are unmistakably goblin, and some match one-to-one with the reported ‘missing persons’ reports brought up to our governors.\n\nThey were huddled together in silence, some clutching what were clearly children when a wizened figure - as was apparent in his hunched posture and husky voice - came forward and dictated their plea. They were followers of a religion not too dissimilar from those we conquered from up above, and they asked if they could go free for a tithe and practice the faith they were forced to hide away from the world.\n\nThe tithe is not an insignificant amount, what do you say boss, do we give them the signature ‘goblin guarantee’?”
  exodus_goblin_flavour.9.a:0 “Good deal”
  exodus_goblin_flavour.9.b:0 “cross my fingers and hope you…”

  exodus_goblin_flavour.17.t:0 “Ourdia”
  exodus_goblin_flavour.17.d:0 “For goblins, there are few things that unite a people like great and joyous destruction. And while the landsharkers certainly share our love of seeing things get blown into smithereens, the human defenders and citizens nearby don’t much appreciate our intention to re-enact our great and valiant victory over their former masters - citing such drivel like ‘structural security’ and ‘collateral damage’ as concerns we should care about./n/nThat said, there may be a point in reminding our rather zealous, and drooling, soldiers slobbering all over their shiny new toys that the fort of Ourdia might be better off standing now that we own it.”
  exodus_goblin_flavour.17.a:0 “Stop them before too much damage”
  exodus_goblin_flavour.17.b:0 “Boys will be boys”

  exodus_goblin_flavour.11.t:0 “Glass Isles”
  exodus_goblin_flavour.11.d:0 “It seemed like it was only a few decades ago that goblins were woeful and hopeless in their venture to conquer the seas of Bahar. But now a sight thought impossible by our ancestors burst through the great doors of the capitol tent: a goblin of unmistakable repute, who bore a symbol of a skull stabbed by two shanks at the front of a black cap perched atop her head, its sides stretching further than the span of her own shoulders and its peak reaching the foaming chin of her gnoll escort./n/nShe struts towards [Root.Monarch.GetName], a parchment in both her hands, clutching a great knife between teeth that were almost as sharp as it was. With no regard for the nearby guards or retainers, who were already on edge, she takes the parchment and spreads it bare at the feet of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] before stabbing it at the site of a few islands off the coast of the Bahar subcontinent, her eyes shining up at the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] expectantly, despite the sudden surging of spears coming from every direction, hovering inches off her skin./n/n’Here’s the deal,’  she starts, with a troubling nonchalance. ‘You help me get these isles into my hands, you take a cut of the loot. Fair’s fair, right?’ the corsair says, gesturing towards her page with the beckoning of a hand, causing the gnoll to throw a chest, full of gems and loot onto the floor./n/n’So, what do you say, we got a deal boss?’ she asks, lowering a nearby offending spear with a light touch before stretching her hand forward in a friendly gesture.”
  exodus_goblin_flavour.11.a:0 “Too risky.”
  exodus_goblin_flavour.11.b:0 “It’s a deal!”
