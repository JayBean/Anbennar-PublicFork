  vazhatun_discovery_of_the_survivors_title:0 "Discovery of the Survivors"
  vazhatun_discovery_of_the_survivors_desc:0 "The fall of Aul-Dwarov was one of the greatest tragedies of all time. Our people, the dwarves, nay, the entire world has lost so much knowledge, so much cultural ingenuity and industrial genius that it is almost impossible to bear. Now, however, we have a glimmer of hope, a faint star in the dark firmament that heralds a discovery so profound, so important to our cause, that few dare to hope.\n\nThere were survivors. There are survivors."

  vazhatun_records_of_the_fall_title:0 "Records of the Fall"
  vazhatun_records_of_the_fall_desc:0 "Amldihr was, in its time, the greatest of all holds in the Dwarovar. Here sat the High-Kings themselves, presiding over their vast subterranean domain. While it is far away from the light of the night-sky, there the dwarves of yore had their libraries, their large archives, and maybe there we will find a glimpse into what had happened all those centuries ago. The truth is what we seek - hopefully we'll find it."

  vazhatun_securing_the_vale_title:0 "Securing the Vale"
  vazhatun_securing_the_vale_desc:0 "The Serpent's Vale, also known as the Granary of the Dwarovar, is both an economically and strategically important location. We should make sure that our control over the vale is secure and that it will remain so."

  vazhatun_western_connections_title:0 "Western Connections"
  vazhatun_western_connections_desc:0 "Though we once came as settlers from Cannor, by now we've lived isolated in the Serpentspine and Northern Pass for so long that most of us have never even stepped foot in Cannor before. With the western woods secured, however, the potential of a link to the dwarves and humans back in Cannor has appeared. New settlers, trade routes, and scientific cooperation all await us, if we can only clear the way through."

  vazhatun_the_western_port_title:0 "The Western Port"
  vazhatun_the_western_port_desc:0 "The City of World's Desire, arguably the centre of the surfacer's world, is Anbénncost. Home to the Order of Chroniclers, with great contacts to the Imperial Archives and in direct neighbourhood to the Magisterium, it is this city where we should make our gambit. Our path there is long and through many other peoples; in order to create a direct contact, we must build a sea route."

  vazhatun_experts_of_magic_title:0 "Experts of Magic"
  vazhatun_experts_of_magic_desc:0 "The mages of the Magisterium, the magisters, as they are called, are wise in the ways of the arcane. They possess the knowledge of the ages, and in their deepest archives there might be the formula, the equation, the translation of the runes that our great mages can not decipher yet. With their help, this might be possible at last."

  vazhatun_the_new_science_title:0 "The New Science"
  vazhatun_the_new_science_desc:0 "For centuries, science and the ability to cast spells were almost synonymous. True advancement was always made by mages, they had the time and the education to dedicate themselves to the wonders of the world. Now, however, a new path opens itself up. Suddenly we no longer need to cast spells, the spells are cast for us. Is it possible to use this new technology to improve our telescope?"

  vazhatun_the_ravelian_church_title:0 "The Ravelian Church"
  vazhatun_the_ravelian_church_desc:0 "[Root.GetVazhatunRavelianMissionDesc]"
  vazhatun_the_ravelian_church_desc_a:0 "The Ravelian Church is a strange institution, a mixture of religious dogma and the scientific method. What we cannot deny, however, is that their artificers do know what they are talking about. Maybe we can get their help if we ask them for an exchange of knowledge?"
  vazhatun_the_ravelian_church_desc_b:0 "The Rectorate is renowned not only in their knowledge of the One God, but also in their knowledge of how to spread His divine gifts through artificery. Surely they would help their brethren in faith in our mutual quest to unravel the secrets of the world."

  vazhatun_fresh_air_title:0 "Fresh Air"
  vazhatun_fresh_air_desc:0 "It is in the nature of the dwarf that he needs no sunlight, that he can dwell underground for his entire life. While that is true, we do need to breathe from time to time, and the miasmic wafts of gas that fill the tunnels and caves and call themselves 'air' are laughable compared to the fresh mountain air that we can now sample once again, hunting and frolicking in the Northern Pass, without fear of the many monsters that stalk the caverns below."
  
  vazhatun_proper_equipment_title:0 "Proper Equipment"
  vazhatun_proper_equipment_desc:0 "Permafrost is a treacherous thing, its harsh surface and cracking grounds are not to be scoffed at. To be able to traverse such locations safely is of paramount importance. To do so, we have theorized, we could use the knowledge of the Ramsteel Dwarves, experts at travelling across the frozen ground. Their ancient hold might still contain some of the equipment they were using."

  vazhatun_records_of_the_refugees_title:0 "Records of the Refugees"
  vazhatun_records_of_the_refugees_desc:0 "The stubborn dwarves of Krakdhûmvror have the knowledge we need hidden away in their frozen hold. If they are not willing to share it with us out of their own accord, we must make them share it against their own volition."

  vazhatun_sequester_the_insane_title:0 "Sequester the Insane"
  vazhatun_sequester_the_insane_desc:0 "It is watching us. It waits. It lurks within the mind and the soul, it eats its way through all that we are, were, and will be - but we cannot let this knowledge become public yet. All those afflicted with the terror must be removed from the public. The best place for that are the Lonely Mountains to the north; there we can keep the insane safely away from the others."

  vazhatun_study_the_terror_title:0 "Study the Terror"
  vazhatun_study_the_terror_desc:0 "The dreams are uncertain, the babble-seizures rarely reveal much about the nature of this strange terror. We must dedicate ourselves to figuring out what is happening with our people."

  vazhatun_fortifying_the_pass_title:0 "Fortifying the Pass"
  vazhatun_fortifying_the_pass_desc:0 "While the eastern edge of the Northern Pass is bound to the Giant's Anvil by only a small, naturally defensible passage between the Forbidden Plains and the Serpentspine, the west is not that fortunate. We must fortify the wide forests if we wish to keep ourselves safe from harm."

  vazhatun_back_to_school_title:0 "Back to School"
  vazhatun_back_to_school_desc:0 "Dûr-Vazhatun was always known as a center of learning, and the knowledge we can gain from our Setzunkhûpa would give any academy in Dûr-Vazhatun an edge over the rest of Halann. But a truly world-class institution for teaching and scholarship requires more than just access to exclusive information. Our isolation has made it hard for us to appraise how our fledgling institutions truly compare to the outside world, until now that is. Among the Triunics it seems that one academy is held in regard over all others: the Kovtalzar Academy. Let us visit this institute, and see what we can adapt from it for a world-class academy of our own."

  vazhatun_the_knowledge_of_the_dame_title:0 "Damish Knowledge"
  vazhatun_the_knowledge_of_the_dame_desc:0 "The Damish Temple is one of the great Cannorian centers of learning. In devotion to their goddess they've assembled a library of texts from all over Halann, and their Moonmount observatory is a match for anything but the Setzunkhûpa itself. We undoubtedly have a lot we could learn from them, but maybe they could learn from us as well?"

  vazhatun_disseminate_the_knowledge_title:0 "Disseminate the Knowledge"
  vazhatun_disseminate_the_knowledge_desc:0 "What use is knowledge if you can't share it? It's not enough for our scholars to make groundbreaking discoveries, their discoveries need to be spread across our entire nation! The printers in Konwell have precisely what we need to mass-produce our writings, and once the rails are repaired we can easily spread those writings between all of our holds."
  
  vazhatun_clearing_our_home_title:0 "Clearing our Home"
  vazhatun_clearing_our_home_desc:0 "The gate to the Dagrinrod was among the very first things we repaired when we settled in Dûr-Vazhatun, so that the countless hordes that infest the caves beyond can't sneak inside and exterminate us. Even so, the idea of a goblin or orc warband amassing right outside our walls is hardly a pleasant one. We would all sleep safer if we could set up garrisons and patrols along the most immediate stretch of the Dagrinrod so that no monsters may as much as lay their eyes upon our walls."

  vazhatun_securing_our_backs_title:0 "Securing our Backs"
  vazhatun_securing_our_backs_desc:0 "The fall of Aul-Dwarov, the mightiest empire to ever rest beneath the earth, is the greatest tragedy ever to befall our venerable race. Springing fully formed from mud and filth in the dark corners of the Serpentspine, the Orcs multiplied like rats, biting and clawing and working their way into the cracks of the holds until they spilled forth and drowned our ancient halls in ruby-blood. The quantity of knowledge lost in these darkest of days is incalculable.\n\nNow that Dur-Vazhatun has been reclaimed for dwarfkind, it cannot be permitted to fall again. The great fortress homes of Dur-Vazhatun and Orlazam-az-Dihr must be secured, and the Northeastern Serpentspine purged of these invaders, that they may never set foot in our halls again."

  vazhatun_eastern_connections_title:0 "Eastern Connections"
  vazhatun_eastern_connections_desc:0 "Driven from the fertile fields of Escann millenia ago by the Great Cleansings of Castan Beastbane, the barbarous and savage centaurs are the only inhabitants of the Forbidden Plains. Every few centuries, they would surge through the Northern Pass in great herds, seeking to pillage the Serpent's Vale and beyond. Now that we have reoccupied Dûr-Vazhatun, we will be the first line of defense against the centaurs: a terrifying prospect.\n\nImagine our surprise then, to learn of a land beyond the plains, of humans that withstood the hooved horde's migration. This land of lakes contains a people both skilled at arms and cultured in knowledge - a people who could prove valuable friends."

  vazhatun_the_city_reaching_for_the_sky_title:0 "The City of the Horizon"
  vazhatun_the_city_reaching_for_the_sky_desc:0 "Ever since we first met these Triunics we've been enquiring about laws, governance, military tactics, diet, art, literature, science, and, of course, astronomy. It was when the study of the stars was brought up that we first heard the name: Yikashlay, City of the Horizon. Stories of a magically raised plateau, upon which sits a city of massive interconnected towers, atop which one can observe the stars like nowhere else in the three lakes. As fellow observers of the heavens, we should make contact with them, so that we may study the secrets of the heavens together."

  vazhatun_board_the_treasure_fleet_title:0 "Board the Treasure Fleet"
  vazhatun_board_the_treasure_fleet_desc:0 "The people of the Triunic Lakes border the Forbidden Plains to their South, and a cold and bitter sea to the North, but they're not completely cut off from the outside world. Our delegates have heard tales of a great fleet that sails from their ports every ten years, rounding the coast and reaching the ports of Haless to trade spices, silks and knowledge of distant lands. We must secure a spot on this mighty fleet, for who knows what secrets are known by the scholars of the Far East? "

  vazhatun_the_yangcheng_academy_title:0 "The Yangcheng Academy"
  vazhatun_the_yangcheng_academy_desc:0 "While our main specialty lies in astronomy, our scholars work in all fields that help us understand the world around us. One place that has caught their interest in these pursuits is the academy in Yangcheng. While their astronomical knowledge is nothing of note, their wide expertise in multiple scientific fields still makes them a valuable partner for our natural scientists."

  vazhatun_center_of_learning_title:0 "Centre of Learning"
  vazhatun_center_of_learning_desc:0 "This hold was once the center of knowledge for Aul-Dwarov, but that is not us. Instead of merely attracting dwarven scholarships, our net stretches far wider. Our libraries contain manuscripts from Cannor to Haless, our findings are spread as far as our printed books can travel, and astronomers from all over Halann gather for a chance to use our Setzunkhûpa. We are not mere pretenders, we are the Sapphire Dwarves of Dûr-Vazhatun reborn, greater than ever before!"

  vazhatun_a_message_from_the_stars_title:0 "A Message from the Stars"
  vazhatun_a_message_from_the_stars_desc:0 "Our prosperity was limitless. Our renown in the scholarly arts was unmatched. Our knowledge of the universe beyond anything in the history of Halann. Even the astral terror, while unfortunate, had proved to be manageable.\n\nThat's when it happened."

  vazhatun_improving_the_lens_title:0 "Improving the Lens"
  vazhatun_improving_the_lens_desc:0 "Repeated cycles of heat and cold have begun to warp the lens of our beautiful telescope; the picture it projects is no longer focused correctly and the aberrant pictures yield little usable data. We can't replace it, at least not without help from the glass masters of Orlghelovar, but we can correct it a bit."

  vazhatun_reclaim_the_research_stations_title:0 "Reclaim the Stations"
  vazhatun_reclaim_the_research_stations_desc:0 "The map we found seems to show the location of various research stations that the Sapphire Dwarves of old set up all throughout the seemingly endless wastelands that surrounded them. It's doubtful anything besides their foundations remain, but if we find and restore them, it could let us resume whatever research was being done out there."

  vazhatun_contact_with_the_kukatodic_tribes_title:0 "Contact the Local Tribes"
  vazhatun_contact_with_the_kukatodic_tribes_desc:0 "The wilds surrounding our holds are mainly inhabited by our ancient enemies: the goblins, orcs and giantkin. To the east, the vast plains are instead home to innumerable clans of centaurs, with whom we have no historical grudge. Sadly these clans appear to be very hostile to outsiders, and seem to consider us mainly an opportunity to acquire loot and show off their martial prowess. But in the forests north of the centaurs we've found tribes of humans, wary but accepting of our kind. If we could make a formal contact with them, it's likely that their knowledge of their homeland could aid us greatly as we explore further into the east."

  vazhatun_the_damestear_expedition_title:0 "The Damestear Expedition"
  vazhatun_the_damestear_expedition_desc:0 "Among the texts we found were charts trying to predict future meteor impacts. Of special note was a predicted meteor, potentially damestear, that was projected to fall not too far from Dûr-Vazhatun sometime around this millennium. We should establish a base near the projected impact area so we can catch it when it finally falls. And if our wait becomes too long, our mages believe they can shorten the time until impact with just a little extra nudging."

  vazhatun_damestear_research_title:0 "Research Damestear"
  vazhatun_damestear_research_desc:0 "Such a sizable source of damestear is an opportunity we must not squander; instead of selling it all away or using it all up for our magic we should take it to our labs, where our scientists may figure out the secrets behind the massive power of this ore."

  vazhatun_the_eastern_port_title:0 "The Eastern Port"
  vazhatun_the_eastern_port_desc:0 "Of all the ports that the Treasure Fleet visits, Tianlou is by far the richest. Sadly, we can so far only visit it by using the city of Zurkanrek as a middleman. If we could create our own sea route to the city, we could leverage the fame and success of our scholars in order to tie ourselves directly to Tianlou's wealthy elite."

  vazhatun_repairing_the_setzunkhupa_title:0 "Repairing the Setzunkhûpa"
  vazhatun_repairing_the_setzunkhupa_desc:0 "The great lens of the Setzunkhûpa, the greatest observatory from Lorent to Yanshen, was spared the ravages of the Orcs, who in plundering the deepest depths never reached the highest peaks. However, exposure to the elements has warped and scratched it over the millennia. The lens must be repaired along with the great elevator that conveyed the astronomers to the peak, burned in the madness that consumed the hold in its final hours."

  vazhatun_what_they_left_behind_title:0 "What They Left Behind"
  vazhatun_what_they_left_behind_desc:0 "This hold was once the center of knowledge for Aul-Dwarov, but that is not us. We are mere pretenders, sitting in the ruins of the Sapphire Dwarves brilliance. But we shall search through every nook and cranny of this hold for any remains of said brilliance, that it may one day be restored."

  vazhatun_excavating_the_secrets_title:0 "Excavating the Secrets"
  vazhatun_excavating_the_secrets_desc:0 "Thus far, we have only scratched the surface of the knowledge contained within our ancient hold. Antique maps show entire library wings cut off by collapsing ceilings, subsiding floors and makeshift yet sturdy barricades. To claw out the knowledge contained within, we must dig."

  vazhatun_secrets_applied_title:0 "Secrets Applied"
  vazhatun_secrets_applied_desc:0 "The secrets of the Astronomers Sanctum have shed light on many of the mysteries of the Setzunkhûpa - first and foremost, we have gained a foothold in translating the archaic runes that decorate the gleaming brass casing. With this rediscovered knowledge, we can understand the purpose of many of the more obscure controls of the telescope, and even gain an inkling of the purpose of the enchantments alloyed into its housing. As our understanding of the device grows, so too does our knowledge of the stars it observes."

  vazhatun_journey_to_the_oracle_title:0 "Journey to the Oracle"
  vazhatun_journey_to_the_oracle_desc:0 "As we've mingled with the trade ports of Haless, there is one word that we keep hearing: "Oracle". Apparently there is a holy sect deep inland so skilled at divining the future that they receive pilgrims and dignitaries from all over Haless. Taking such a long journey would be hard, and we would need to be well prepared, but the potential of what could be accomplished if we knew how the heavens would move before even laying our eyes upon them cannot be ignored."

  flavor_vazhatun.1.d:0 "The gigantic, blue dome is dotted with shining gems, facsimiles of the stars that the centerpiece, a grand runic telescope, is pointed towards. Rails to the side let the structure slide open, revealing the beautiful night sky over the northern pass. On clear nights, it is said, the whole universe presents itself from here.\n\nThe telescope itself is a grand structure, long and lined with ancient runes, now refurbished and restored to give the metal hull its purpose again: to catch the very light of the stars, the faint rays of blue and yellow and red shimmer that fascinated our ancestors in Dûr-Vazhatun so long ago.\n\nAt its base, the telescope sports a large observation platform, a single chair tilted slightly to the back in front of the ocular wheel, where the different eyepieces reside. To the left and the right are panels with more runic inscriptions, spell-like contraptions that control everything within this room, from the dome-doors to the focuser, the lens assembly, the filter and the ocular wheel.\n\nA single view through the telescope makes all the time and money we poured into it worth it. A thousand stars dotting the sky suddenly become a hundred thousand, the light magnified to a scale incomprehensible to simpler minds. The true beauty of the sky is not hidden within equations and blueprints but right here, in plain sight: The sight of the stars themselves.\n\nA single sign hangs from the back of the chair."
  flavor_vazhatun.1.a:0 ""Do not use telescope to look directly at sun.""

  flavor_vazhatun.2.t:0 "Contact with Krakdhûmvror"
  flavor_vazhatun.2.d:0 "We went to the meeting with the Quartz Dwarves with many questions, how they'd survived all alone for over 7000 years, whether they still followed the old gods, but most of all we wanted to learn the true story behind the fall of Dûr-Vazhatun. We had all heard the fanciful stories of the hold collapsing of a magical mania from beyond the stars, but the dwarves of Krakdhûmvror would have the knowledge needed to dispel these wives' tales and establish the true history of the hold.\n\nThis was not what happened.\n\nTo our surprise and dismay, the Quartz Dwarves not only confirmed legend, but their account was if anything even more terrifying than the stories we were familiar with. The sudden brutality, the chaos, the panic, the desperate struggle to flee, and the constant fear of looking over your shoulder. It was said that the madmen and their victims were impossible to tell apart, for they both had the same terror in their eyes. Maybe in truth the victims were all afflicted as well.\n\nKrakdhûmvror took in what refugees they could -panicked civilians, deserting soldiers, scholars bearing what ancient texts they could carry with them. The latter piqued our interest and we asked the Quartz Dwarves if we could see these texts for ourselves. In response we were called "upstart intruders" and told that the Quartz Dwarves were the rightful owners of the records. Our emissaries of course did not expect such a response, and the meeting ended soon after."

  flavor_vazhatun.3.t:0 "The Fall of Dûr-Vazhatun"
  flavor_vazhatun.3.d:0 "It has been hard work piecing together a coherent story from what remains of the royal archives, but some details are getting clearer. It seems that during the final days of Dûr-Vazhatun, all of Aul-Dwarov was embroiled in conflict with a powerful enemy which was believed to be present not only on Halann but also on other worlds. Some have theorized this could be related to the ancient war between Aul-Dwarov and the Precursor Empire, though no conclusive proof can yet be found. The Sapphire Dwarves seem to have been interested in gaining preemptive knowledge of their enemy's actions, and one document even brings up the possibility of the enemy constructing weapons out in the stars pointed towards Halann. These fears and curiosities seem to have led to increased use of the Setzunkhûpa beyond the "recommended usage", despite several high-ranking astronomers seemingly being against it. These fears appear to have been well-founded, as one day the entire hold seems to have suddenly collapsed. The details are sparse, but the archives talk of terrified refugees and even more terrified attackers, all refusing to look up at the sky. While much is still unclear, it seems the historical fall of Dûr-Vazhatun indeed aligns very closely with the old legends.\n\nWhile some questions have been answered, a new one stands starkly before us. Did this ancient enemy civilization really span across the stars? The archives are too sparse to give us any evidence, but one fact is clear. If the Sapphire Dwarves believed themselves able to spot their constructs with only the Setzunkhûpa…."

  flavor_vazhatun.4.d:0 "Dûr-Vazhatun runs deep, countless layers dug into the mountain like an ant hive. Over the past few months our scouting parties have scoured every accessible part of the hold, searching not only for the usual troves of forgotten treasure but also for any scrap of knowledge left behind by the original inhabitants. Unlike most ancestral holds, Dûr-Vazhatun proceeds not only down into the mountain's heart, but up towards the lofty peaks of the Serpentspine. Whilst the ground levels are comprised largely of armories and convoluted fortifications, and the lower levels contain the vaults and living quarters (for every dwarf desires the cozy security provided deep in the earth), the upper levels seem to have been used for the hold's administration and scholarly pursuits.\n\nThe scouts have encountered crumbling archives where roof collapses have crushed the ancient tablets beyond recognition; libraries blackened by ash or by rot, with the scrolls within reduced to dust, and laboratories paved with broken glass. Any hope for even a scrap of forgotten knowledge had seemed futile, until in a forgotten annex, behind a sturdy stone door which rendered the room airtight and free of decay, was discovered a set of notes, and a map of what seem to be research stations in the vicinity of Dûr-Vazhatun. They describe a series of increasingly common disturbances amongst the hold's astronomers. Apparently overstressed by their work, several talented telescope operators had a number of violent outbursts. Nearly a dozen victims were killed, and the perpetrators confined to cells. They refused to even consider the possibility of returning to their work. One quote in particular stood out:"

  flavor_vazhatun.5.t:0 "Dealing with the Terror"
  flavor_vazhatun.5.d:0 "There's no bigger threat than the astral terror. History shows that if underestimated, this plague could drag our entire [Root.GovernmentName] screaming into the abyss. Our caretakers have worked tirelessly to figure out its root cause. The work has been hard, as many aspects of the disease defy common explanation, yet with time and diligence, some conclusions can now be drawn.\n\nAstral terror manifests mainly as paranoia, or a fear of being watched, particularly by beings from the sky. But to the severely affected these observers seem to be everywhere, emerging from every angle. In extreme cases, this even results in violence, whether due to suspicions of affiliation with these watchers, attempts of "appeasement", or simply acts of pure desperation.\n\nFiguring out the exact cause is surprisingly difficult. The simple answer is that it's caused by looking into space, but why the act of seeing the night sky causes such madness remains a mystery. A common theory is that seeing firsthand how tiny we are compared to the full size of the cosmos is enough to cause anxiety. And the dark of the night sky could potentially obscure any number of unseen things, which explains why this anxiety so often manifests as fear of something from above. This theory, however, is unsatisfying to many. They say these fears are too intense and specific to stem from just seeing the void of space. Another theory thus suggests an inherent magical or psychological property to space itself that causes these symptoms. Some go even further, proposing an active instigator of the disease. As mentioned, the dark of the night sky could potentially obscure any number of unseen things, and nothing says that the fears of being watched have to be wrong.\n\nYet the theories of evil magic or aberrations out in space don't explain how the madness spreads to those who've never even gazed at the stars. While the proponents of a supernatural cause are quick to suggest supernatural transmission as well, they have difficulty explaining why it only seems to spread to those who are aware of the terror in the first place. There have, for example, been no incidents of an affected astronomer spreading terror to their family without exposing their condition to them first. While magic that spreads through knowledge alone isn't unthinkable, the simpler explanation is that people simply latch onto the fear once they know there is something to be fearful of. Seeing others live in fear of unseen watchers can make oneself fear them too, and the fear of your neighbour having contagious madness easily leads to the same violent paranoia seen in astral terror victims. While compelling, this explanation is still insufficient to some, as these "secondary infectees" still exhibit identical symptoms to those who've stared directly into the void. It thus seems impossible to draw an exact line between supernatural disease and mundane social panic.\n\nAs for mitigation, the most effective method would be simply not using the Setzunkhûpa. Yet this is highly unpopular with our rulers and scholars, who refuse to give up our ancestors' knowledge. Luckily, we have found other techniques to alleviate the madness, such as limiting public knowledge, shielding the affected from the sky, secluding them from the uninfected while avoiding total isolation, as well as calming treatments meant to soothe the minds of those struck by the terror. While we do not yet understand the astral terror, we may be able to manage it."

  flavor_vazhatun.6.d:0 "It was in a dark forest clearing, with the light of the moon shining through the opening in the trees, where we met them. A gathering of the largest chieftains in this region, and some from further beyond as well. It seems that this area has long served as a meeting ground for the Kukatodic people. Our languages were foreign to each other, but work on mutual translation had already been underway for some time, and our mages could remove the rough edges that were left in our communication. Once everyone had gathered, and the introductions and pleasantries were concluded, the feast began. We told them of our great civilization, its fall, and how we had retaken our home. They told us of their history, how they had come to this land long ago from the west, how their southern kin in the plains had fallen before the centaurs, and how they had survived in their forests. We told them of the Setzunkhûpa and of the wonders we could see in the sky, they told us of their crones and how they could talk with the spirits of the forest. We gave them a gift in gems and metals from the mountains, they agreed to let their guides show us the way to the sea, and the people who lived beyond it.\n\nWhen we asked them about these peoples beyond the sea, they clearly expected their descriptions to shock us, and they did. But not because their descriptions were new and unthinkable to us, but rather because they were so familiar. As we heard more about these eastern Triunics, it became increasingly clear that we were dealing with an urban society not too unlike our own and the one we left behind in Cannor, miraculously located half a world away from the rest of civilization. This has renewed our determination to push east until we reach the eastern shores and can speak to this alien civilization ourselves.\n\nAs for the Kukatodics, despite their less civilized nature they haven't avoided our curiosity either. Their name means "hill watchers", a name which combined with their western origins have caused some of their scholars to suggest that they may have lived near or even interacted with the Setzunkhûpa in the distant past. These theories, however, will have to remain pure conjecture for now."

  flavor_vazhatun.7.d:0 "The key was unassuming. Well-wrought, from high grade steel, smooth and angular, yet undecorated. Such a key could open any number of ancient doors or chests, untouched since the Hold first fell, but the metal's quality implied its former owner was a dwarf of considerable means. Yet thus far, every door remained unopened, every chest unplundered. This was not in itself unusual - every dwarven hold had its share of secret rooms, of mysterious passages, of hidden mysteries beyond number. Such was part of the joy of delving the halls of one's ancestors. It was practically considered a mark of good fortune to have a mysterious key, for it promised great riches should one be the dwarf holding the right key at the right time. Thus, when Fjalki Stonecarver happened to stop to lace his boot in the Second Annex of the Third Corridor, a shiver of anticipation rushed down his spine when he came to eye level with what could only be, disguised as it was, a keyhole.\n\nThe key, which he kept on a cord about his neck for luck, was removed with care, and with an intake of breath, Fjalki pushed it inside. He braced himself for the jarring sensation of it catching as he began to turn, but his heart leapt as it turned as though it were slipping through water. With the gentlest push against the wall, seams appeared in the stone where none had existed previously, and the wall became, unmistakable, a door. It swung open without a sound, soft as silk. \n\nFjalki stepped through, onto the first step of a staircase. Turning clockwise, it went down. The chamber was shaped like a great well, with steps ringing its wall ever downwards. The walls were bare, without carvings, or rails, or even sconces for lamps. Fjalki ducked back into the corridor and grabbed a torch from the wall, quickly checking to ensure nobody else would stumble on his discovery. Returning to the well, he held the torch out into the void, and dropped it.\n\nThe torch tumbled down, and down, and down, shadows flickering from the steps in brilliant patterns. Fjalki watched as the torch fell into a hole as deep as the sky."

An effort was made to construct a crane at the summit to lower material to the base, but the ceiling of the otherwise smooth chamber is battered and broken. It is likely an elevator of some kind existed here when the hold was new, but whatever catastrophe befell Dûr-Vazhatun seems to have ripped it from its housing. We have transported wood, rope and tools down on foot, like mountain goats scaling a cliff, and more than one dwarf has lost his footing. The screams of the falling dwarves echo for longer than seems possible.\n\nFinally, with great effort we reached the Tower's foot. The mechanisms of the fallen elevator are battered and broken, topped with the crumpled bodies of the now unrecognisable fallen. A door at the base leads into a series of exquisitely decorated rooms. The ceilings are perfect hemispheres, still painted in midnight blue and speckled with garnets, diamonds and rubies in mimicry of the night sky. One room seems to be a council chamber, with a circular table carved of granite topped by a magnificent brass armillary sphere. Another is a small library - most of the books have long since rotted, yet some etched plates and stone carvings still remain. The etchings contain many of the same runes that decorate the Setzunkhûpa, and our technicians believe they will be a great boon to understanding the telescope's workings.The knowledge contained here was evidently too valuable to be left to the lesser scholars of the hold, hence the secrecy of the Archive's entrance.

Once we got closer we could make out the shape of a plateau, 30 feet high, walls as steep as a building, topped by massive towers. Our guide told us the story of the mad mage who had raised the platform and constructed the first towers. We went up a narrow stair carved from the walls of the plateau and reached the top, which was flat as a marble floor, and dotted with buildings more normal than the towers we had seen previously. The towers themselves were often lined with hanging gardens, which we were told had fed the city during a siege, and connected by a dizzying network of bridges through which one could apparently walk from one end of the city to the other without ever touching the ground.\n\nOur guide led us through an underground market built inside of the plateau, like a cruder version of our own work in the Dwarovar, and then up through the many towers and bridges themselves. After a tour through various important vertical gardens, temples, exhibitions and government offices high above the ground, we finally reached the tallest of the towers, atop which the city's astronomers had their observatory. From this peak, we could see the entire city of Yikashlay, the vast grasslands surrounding it, and other settlements far in the distance.\n\nAs impressive as the view downwards was, our own astronomers found the view upwards less than impressive. As high as it was, this observatory could not nearly match the altitude of our own mountain peak, and as grand as their observatory was, it could not hold a candle to the sophistication of our Setzunkhûpa. Still, Yikashlay's long astronomical traditions had given them a wealth of material with which we could speed up our own understanding of the heavens. A deal was struck where our astronomers would gain access to these documents in exchange for letting a delegation of astronomers set up permanent residence in Dûr-Vazhatun where they could study the stars together with us. Just as we've been shown the wonders of Yikashlay, it was time for us to show off the wonders of Dûr-Vazhatun."

  flavor_vazhatun.11.d:0 "Everyone knows that damestear is a blue crystal, usually found at meteor impacts, that can store magic for later use, though the stored magic will slowly dissipate over time. If pulverized, this crystal can then be mixed with liquid to create mana potions or forged into alloys for creating magical items. Inhaling damestear powder without any liquid is known to cause internal hemorrhaging. One theory says that the majority of damestear meteorites are actually shards of the great Oracle's Eye comet.\n\nThis common knowledge is not enough for us, and we have endeavored to figure out everything we can about this important ore. This starts with understanding its more mundane properties; like how heavy it is compared to other rocks, how dense and brittle it is, and the way it reflects light passing through it. Similar studies are naturally also performed on the various damestear alloys our metallurgists have been able to produce. But of course our scientists are just as interested in the more mystical aspects of damestear; how much magic can it store, what is the dissipation rate of its stored magic, how much magical energy gets lost in the conversion from magic to crystal to magic again? Why does powderization seem to reduce damestear's ability to store magic, yet not its ability to transfer magic in materials like damestear alloys?\n\nThe questions are many, and we still haven't answered all of them, but our experiments on its crystalline and magical properties have made us able to create finer and more potent damestear powder than ever before, allowing us to create notably more powerful mana potions, and expanding the number of damestear alloys we have been able to produce. This has expanded both the strength and versatility of our magic."

Access to the library's contents is controlled by the priests of the Dame, who oversee everyone entering the building or picking a book from its shelves and archives, and permit few to view the records at all.\n\nBut we have an advantage that scholars from other realms lack. While the Damish priests eagerly collect all the knowledge they can get their hands on, they take special pride in their knowledge of the night sky, where their goddess makes her home. The Moonmount observatory is one of the oldest and most advanced observatories in human lands, but it still can't at all compare to the views we get from the Setzunkhûpa. By sharing some of our astral knowledge with the Damish Temple, we negotiated ourselves privileged access to their archives, and even managed to take a few interesting texts home with us.

We should copy their designs to set up printing presses across all of our holds, which is significantly easier to do now that we've gotten the Dwarovar railways up and running again. These same railways will then spread our texts all over the country and to lands beyond as well.

Their home, they claim, has an observatory on the top of a sky-high mountain, which uses staggeringly advanced magic and engineering to bring the stars closer than anyone thought possible.

In particular, with regards to our nearest celestial neighbour, the moon, many have begun to argue as to whether there might be a palace for the Dame upon the surface, or that the corpse of Kuza might appear in some manner. Soon, all will be clear, as our efforts have recently seen success.\n\nA few short hours ago, after seemingly endless reconfigurations of the Setzunkhûpa, we have finally managed to focus the telescope on the moon. While our vision remains restricted, strong evidence for two phenomena have been observed. Firstly, craters remarkably similar to those left by meteors that strike Halann have been witnessed, reigniting the old theories about lunar damestear. Secondly, at this stage, there appears to be no significant atmosphere about the sphere. It is possible that life might survive beneath the surface of the moon, yet, we are hesitant to move beyond our findings into the realm of speculation.\n\nRegardless, the astronomy and engineering teams have broken into celebration.

Initial assumptions of interference by avian defecation were disproved by exterior examination of the telescope. Upon refocusing, the object was revealed to be an airborne structure, at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. The scale of the structure was difficult to determine due to significant cloud presence, but it appears to be a fortification, not dissimilar to a castle of human construction, upscaled by a factor of three or even four. The propulsion system for the structure is not evident, but it maintains altitude and velocity with the local clouds.\n\nHypothesis: Rumours and legends across Halann have arisen over the past few millennia of Cloud Giants, a race that survived the fall of the Giant Empire of the Jötunnlagen by taking to the sky in floating castles. Ridiculous as this idea may seem, there are few other candidates with the potential to construct and pilot immense airborne fortifications. If the Cloud Giants are real, they present a dire threat to Dwarfkind. The only giantkin known to still exist are Ogres and Trolls, violent but dimwitted creatures that present little threat to a secure hold. The tales told of giants describe them as cunning adversaries, formidable foes that the Ancestors warred with for millennia until their downfall. To lift an entire castle would take cunning artifice or powerful magic, presenting the horrific new possibility of an attack from above.

  flavor_vazhatun.42.d:0 ""The Chained Sun: A Treatise on the Sun's Appearance in Astronomy, Mythology and Religion\nAuthor: Nalin Goodanvil\nIt is unknown what exactly the ancient dwarves thought about the sun. As mostly subterranean creatures, the impact of the sun and moon was much smaller in dwarven society than in those of most other races. The name Gurthbael occurs in a few ancient sources as a possible sun god, though it is unclear what role he may have played in Aul-Dwarov's mythology, or if he was ever truly worshipped. Even if he was, his importance declined along with most of the gods during the fall of Aul-Dwarov as most dwarves turned from the distant cosmic powers of the gods to the more intimate powers of our ancestors. Even when in contact with humans like the Bulwari, who greatly venerated the sun, most dwarves would keep to their own ritual practices, forming a parallel religion to the practices of the humans. A notable exception would be the great number of dwarves who swore fealty to the Court of Castellos along with Balgar, yet even they would largely ignore the sun which the Cannorians associated with the malevolent primordial Draxos.\n\nYet while the Bulwari saw the sun as their salvation and the Cannorians saw it as an antagonist, one thing they had in common was their belief in the sun as a diminished force, wishing to return to its true power. The Bulwari told of how Surael lost his body and awaits rebirth, while the Cannorian spoke of how Draxos was imprisoned by Agrados. This motif can even be found among the vile goblins, with their chained sun goddess Tewaka Sunka. While some may have dismissed these ideas as mere superstition, our very own astronomers have seen the truth in them. In the reports from the Setzunkhûpa you can read accounts of dark spots appearing and disappearing all over the sun, what could this be if not an assault by dark forces? Some have even seen the sun counterattack by discharging massive flares into the void. We Sapphire Dwarves pride ourselves on being the only dwarves to truly look up instead of just staring down, isn't it time we started to appreciate the full power of what lies in the celestial spheres?""

Through the eyes of the Setzunkhûpa, Agradent turned from a glimmering point of light into a multicoloured sphere not too dissimilar from what Halann must look like to an outside observer. The majority of Agradent's surface is red, like the god it was named after. There are however large smooth blue areas, different in texture than the rest of the surface. Large white patches can also be seen, and seem to gradually move across the surface. The most surprising discovery was that of small rings surrounding the planet.\n\nConclusions: The movements of the white areas and the smoothness of the blue indicate that they are clouds and water respectively. This leaves the red areas the only ones to represent Agradent's actual surface, and we can conclude that the planet's outer layers are mainly made up of red minerals.\n\nHypothesis: No signs of Agrados or his famous vigil have been found, though no one can quite agree on what the signs would even look like. The origin and composition of the rings are unclear. The only point of comparison we have is how the Fields of Echoes form a ring around the sun, and it is possible that these rings are similarly made out of countless smaller objects in orbit around the planet. While they look tiny to us, to anyone actually standing on Agradent they would have to be enormous. Speaking of which, the existence of clouds and water on the planet opens up the possibility of life forms on the surface, but the vast amount of red and the relatively smaller bodies of water means that Agradent's potential for life and civilization is likely much more limited than that of Halann.""

Despite the vast span of time between their estimated date and the present, the uncanny precision of their measurements has been proven. The Clomrad can frequently be seen with the naked eye and has oft been observed through lesser telescopes,  but using solely data from these records and a simple application of Jurgen Helmsmith's Triplicate Accords of Celestial Motion, the Setzunkhûpa was trained to a patch of daylit sky. Lo and behold, tonight the Veiled One appeared, precise in position down to an arcsecond. The Clomrad's atmosphere bears a beautiful verdigris hue, with stripes of dull silver. The size of the rocky surface beneath is indeterminate. The planet appears surprisingly large considering its relative distance from Halann. Detailed information on the Clomrad's orbiting bodies is expected to be included in the following report.\n\nCommentaries and Hypotheses: The Clomrad, or "The Veiled One" as translators have rendered it from their understanding of the Precursor tongue, is mentioned disproportionately amongst celestial bodies amongst their extant texts. The reason for this name is unknown, but likely relates to the shifting copper-blue clouds that enshroud its surface. Just what the Precursors believed to be concealed below the clouds is unknown. The Clomrad is at least ten times greater in diameter than Halann, so any civilisation existing there would likely be of either colossal size or enormous number. The Precursors kept incredibly accurate records of its position, and of the movement of its clouds. For what purpose? Did they believe the Veiled One to conceal a threat, or perhaps a great treasure?

Darolsten's atmosphere bears its usual muddy brown-orange hue, slowly transitioning into a leathery tan. In a historic occasion, the existence of the 'Seven Dwarves', long considered to border on myth, is tentatively confirmed, pending confirmatory orbital analysis. No human telescope has had sufficient resolving power to distinguish them from their parent in thousands of years, though Dwarven records and Precursor texts mention their existence. Due to a lack of surviving records, it's impossible to tell which of the ancient dwarven names matches which body; hence the author reserves the right to assign names to these moons, and dubs these The Expulsive, The Brilliant, The Jubilant, The Blushing, The Mirthless, The Ignorant and The Slumbering in order of luminescence. They vary in size, though each is smaller than Halann, and range in shades of gray from shale to flint.\n\nCommentaries and Hypotheses: Yet again, another planet's surface defies observation. Larger planets seem to naturally tend towards thick, obscuring atmospheres, perhaps indicating their formation occurs under different circumstances. Darolsten and the Seven Dwarves, as they are known by the men of Cannor, have the distinction of being the sole celestial bodies to maintain their original, dwarven names (though those of the moons are frequently crudely translated). While many dwarven astronomers are offended by this association of the diminutive size of the moons with our people, it is likely this less than flattering association that has made the dwarven names of these celestial bodies so widely spread.

As the Setzunkhûpa has failed to pick up any signs of the comet, but multiple suspected fragments, it seems likely that the Oracle's Eye did indeed shatter, which spells an uncertain future for the world's damestear supplies.

The colour of the lunar craters in this observation, when combined with those of existing observations in different lighting conditions, and corrected for the colour of the moon's regular geology, shows a 95% match with the colour of damestear in multiple of the larger craters. The colour of the lunar anomaly, however, when subjected to similar scrutiny, shows no conclusive overlap with any known naturally occurring minerals or metals.\n\nCommentaries and Hypotheses: "The association of damestear with the moon has existed for many centuries, going at least as far back as the Damerians. They believed the moon, or rather the Dame, to be the source of damestear. More modern theories have largely abandoned the moon-as-source hypothesis for the moon-as-recipient, pointing to the moon's many large craters, seemingly formed from meteor impacts. Famously, the Order of Chroniclers in cooperation with several wealthy Anbenncost philanthropists have issued a notable reward for anyone able to conclusively prove the existence of lunar damestear. I believe this latest data finally proves the hypothesis beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe "anomaly" on the other hand, seems completely absent from the historical record before we discovered it. And instead of giving any clear answers to its nature, this latest data only confirms its abnormality. As it is not located inside a crater, and its colour doesn't match that of any expected lunar geological phenomena, we might have to embrace some more fantastical hypotheses. While the potential of a serious planar breach as in Yezel Mora or the Deepwoods has been brought up, the more pervasive theory instead looks to the only preexisting predictions of abnormal observations on the moon: the Sapphire Dwarves' search for interstellar constructions.

Sobbing uncontrollably, he explained that "it" keeps following him, wherever he goes, and he will never find peace again. Any further inquiries into what "it" exactly was, only resulted in what can best be described as disjointed ramblings. Seeing that something had gone wrong with his head, he was removed from his post and sent to a physician. This would have been the end of the incident, if not for the two other astronomers who revealed that they also had recently been suffering from recurring anxiety that bore striking similarities to what the broken scholar had just described. Many explanations were put forth for why so many of our scholars would get these strange symptoms at the same time, including coincidence, workplace stress or even a magical curse. The one explanation that nobody wanted to utter, but everyone knew, was the similarity between these events and the mythical "astral terror" that features so prominently in the story of how Dûr-Vazhatun originally fell all those millennia ago.\n\nA series of new directives have been issued to the scholars of the Setzunkhûpa in response to this incident, most importantly limiting the time that each individual astronomer gets to look directly through the lens, and forbidding anyone from revealing the true details of what just happened to any outsiders. If the public learns of these events, the old stories might convince them to shut down the Setzunkhûpa permanently, which would be a disastrous loss to both the scientific progress and the heritage of Aul-Dwarov."

Asking around, confused at who let this happen, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] found out that this night, this time, everything went well. All the skirmishes have gone well, nobody has succumbed to the terror, and the people seem just a little more confident than before, just a little more sure of themselves.

After succeeding in breaking Dûr-Vazhatun the marauding mobs all broke apart and ran away in their own fear, leaving us to pick up the pieces. The elevator to the Setzunkhûpa was destroyed again, leaving the observatory itself undamaged, though it will likely take some time before we can reach it, or anyone dares to use it again.\n\nAll over our country, similar stories are emerging. It seems the armed bands that once roamed the countryside have disbanded, and the people whose towns and cities were under their control can finally emerge from their attics and cellars. Even the steady reports of new terror incidents have stopped. It almost feels like things are going a bit too well, as if our survival came only from some higher being that decided to show mercy to us…"
