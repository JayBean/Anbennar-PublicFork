 arakeprun_ruins_of_greatness_title:0 "Ruins of Greatness"
 arakeprun_ruins_of_greatness_desc:0 "Arakeprun is a mighty and grand city built upon the bones of Precursors. However, its grandeur falls short upon closer inspection: it is mostly a shanty town of ramshackle buildings built upon the foundations of better men. Arakeprun must be restored to its former glory, and most importantly a new temple to observe the mysteries of the Precursors and the magic of the Fey."
 arakeprun_splendor_of_spring_court_title:0 "Splendor of the Spring Court"
 arakeprun_splendor_of_spring_court_desc:0 "The Spring Court resides by the Glorelthir and the Milsgelp sea, enjoying the fertility of its lands and the plentiful ruins providing Precursor relic.

 arakeprun_protector_of_selpheregi_desc:0 "Surrounded by the Tuathak, Caamas, and the zealous Peitar, the Selpheregi endure warfare with those jealous of their prime lands. Arakeprun must assert its dominance as the Protector of the Selpheregi, so that our people can prosper together."
 arakeprun_pretenders_of_pelomar_title:0 "Pretenders of Pelomar"
 arakeprun_pretenders_of_pelomar_desc:0 "Proudly proclaiming in their halls, the Pelomar believe that they are the voice of the Domandrod Fey. Their oath is hollow, their power meaningless, for they are but pretenders. Already the Protector of the Selpheregi, we should put Pelomar out of the misery of their false pretensions, and claim the title for ourselves!"
 arakeprun_sidpar_wards_restored_title:0 "Sidpar Wards Restored"
 arakeprun_sidpar_wards_restored_desc:0 "Over the years the Sidpar Wards have become neglected, loosening control over the trade with the Peitar and Fey of the Domandrod. With our backing by the Fey, let us rebuild and restrict this important trade to one power: ours."

 arakeprun_conquest_of_the_summer_city_desc:0 "The principal city of the Caamas and the Summer Court, Murdkather stands as a threat against our mission of unifying the seasons.

 arakeprun_tools_of_ancestors_desc:0 "Throughout Eordand, countless Precursor ruins dot the landscape, containing valuable relics. The greatest of cities, Arakeprun, was rebuilt using tools from these ruins, but with the revolt of Elchos it has fallen into stagnation. We must correct this by establishing more ruin excavation operations in Varn and Letmener."

 arakeprun_spring_court_victorious_desc:0 "For the first time in history, all four courts of Eordand are united under one.

 arakeprun_seize_the_autumn_court_desc:0 "North of Arakeprun on the island of Einnsag the Autumn Court of the Tuathak convenes. Believing in the supremacy of the Autumn over all seasons, they spit in our belief of the Spring.

 arakeprun_foghar_under_arrag_desc:0 "With the seizure of Einnsag, the traditional seat of the Autumn Court is ours. However, the vast majority of the Tuathak lands are still held by the many Dukads and Scarbags. They must be made subservient to our Court on Einnsag."

 arakeprun_borders_of_winter_desc:0 "The city of Darblath marks the traditional northern border of the Tuathak lands, and serves as a bulwark against the Snecboth forces of Winter. Unfortunately, their hold over the season is weak at best, and they have been unable to continue the Warmth rites. Subjects of us by right, we must make them bow and continue these rituals, by our demand!"
 arakeprun_quell_the_blizzard_title:0 "Quell the Blizzard"
 arakeprun_quell_the_blizzard_desc:0 "In the far north of Eordand the Snecboth dwell in cold and miserable lands.

 arakeprun_convert_the_fograc_desc:0 "The first step of our expedition should be to enlist the help of the Fograc. Although they had rejected our faith, they are our wayward brethren. If we would show them the light of our ways, perhaps they could help us in our expedition?"

 arakeprun_unearthed_knowledge_of_cadcimn_desc:0 "It has been many years since the Eordan Expedition has started excavating Cadcimn, and many wonders have been found. However, until now only small artifacts and chambers have been found. Now large portions of the original structure have been found, mostly intact. This is a true breakthrough, exactly what we have been missing all this time. We must explore further!"
 arakeprun_dawnfires_gambit_title:0 "Dawnfire's Gambit"
 arakeprun_dawnfires_gambit_desc:0 "The lands of the Spring Court have always been fruitful in more than just crops. Countless Precursor ruins dot the landscape, even making up the foundation of Arakeprun city. Surpassing traces of magic, Filnar Dawnfire has detected a source to the south in the rebellious state of Elchos. However, none of the rest of the magisters have been able to confirm this, seeming a fool's quest to some. Let us prove them wrong!"

 arakeprun_darhan_blossoming_desc:0 "The heart of the Spring Court, and by extension the heart of Eordand, Darhan is a land of bountiful flowers and growth even in the midst of winter. Arakeprun is the center of Darhan, a magnificent city, but without its surroundings of Tanan and Virb it would not be possible. Our advisors are suggesting that a massive public works program should be launched to improve Darhan, suggesting that it is currently a but a bulb that will blossom into a beautiful flower with effort."

 arakeprun_darhan_textiles_desc:0 "Noted for its fine fabrics and clothes, the fields of Darhan are planted with a variety of cotton, hemp, and even fine silk produced from animals imported from the Domandrod. Because of the efforts made into developing the region, the production of these fabrics has expanded, along with the demand. Our government must promote these industries and reprioritize Arakeprun as a center for cloth production rather than the obsolete incense trade."
