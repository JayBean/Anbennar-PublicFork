 arakeprun_ruins_of_greatness_desc:0 "Arakeprun is a mighty and grand city built upon the bones of Precursors. However, its grandeur falls short upon closer inspection: it is mostly a shanty town of ramshackle buildings built upon the foundations of better men. Arakeprun must be restored to its former glory, and most importantly a new temple to observe the mysteries of the Precursors and the magic of the Fey."

 arakeprun_splendor_of_spring_court_desc:0 "The Spring Court resides by the Glorelthir and the Milsgelp sea, enjoying the fertility of its lands and the plentiful ruins providing Precursor relic.

 arakeprun_pretenders_of_pelomar_desc:0 "Proudly proclaiming in their halls, the Pelomar believe that they are the voice of the Domandrod Fey. Their oath is hollow, their power meaningless, for they are but pretenders. Already the Protector of the Selpheregi, we should put Pelomar out of the misery of their false pretensions, and claim the title for ourselves!"

 arakeprun_sidpar_wards_restored_desc:0 "Over the years the Sidpar Wards have become neglected, loosening control over the trade with the Peitar and Fey of the Domandrod. With our backing by the Fey, let us rebuild and restrict this important trade to one power: ours."

 arakeprun_conquest_of_the_summer_city_desc:0 "The principal city of the Caamas and the Summer Court, Murdkather stands as a threat against our mission of unifying the seasons.

We must correct this by establishing more ruin excavation operations in Varn and Letmener."

 arakeprun_seize_the_autumn_court_desc:0 "North of Arakeprun on the island of Einnsag the Autumn Court of the Tuathak convenes.

 arakeprun_borders_of_winter_desc:0 "The city of Darblath marks the traditional northern border of the Tuathak lands, and serves as a bulwark against the Snecboth forces of Winter. Unfortunately, their hold over the season is weak at best, and they have been unable to continue the Warmth rites. Subjects of us by right, we must make them bow and continue these rituals, by our demand!"
