Many have come to regard [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName] as the best career destination, and with every tributary mission more set out to see the wonders of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] capital.\nWhile there was initially some worry that this would be a drain on some of our country's most valued people, it does give us influence in the wider circle of countries around [Root.Overlord.GetName]. The few people that choose to return also have valuable experience that we can put to good use."

Even countries where we have little, if any, direct power feel the need to actively position themselves along the guidelines we set for countries in our sphere. In many courts the [Root.Culture.GetName] language is seen now as the language of diplomacy and culture and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] figures as an authority in the minds of men and women far beyond our borders."

The province of [tributary_trader_port.GetName] has also started to attract greater numbers of [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] traders and adventurers, further allowing the region to prosper.\nSome undoubtedly see it as a good way to avoid the watchful eye of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] customs and law enforcement, however. Encouraging these fortune seekers will likely prolong the economic boom of [tributary_trader_port.GetName], but it might still not be in our best interest."

 tributary_events.9.d:0 "We have received complaints from the Ministry of Rites that the great number of Tributary Missions that reach [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is taxing their resources.

 tributary_events.10.t:0 "The [ningbo_province.GetCapitalName] Incident"
 tributary_events.10.d:0 "A tributary mission is more than a journey to pay respect to the [Root.GetTributaryOverlord], it is also an opportunity for trade with the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName]. Seeking to capitalize on this it seems competing noble houses in [ningbo_country.GetName] have taken to the habit of sending their own tributary missions to us, claiming to represent the [ningbo_country.Monarch.GetTitle] in order to gain advantages for themselves in the internal politics of [ningbo_country.GetName].\nThis time, however, two such missions arrived at the same time in [ningbo_province.GetName], which made their conflicts from home erupt into bloodshed."
 tributary_events.10.a:0 "Restrict Trade with [ningbo_country.GetName]."
 tributary_events.10.b:0 "Assign the two factions different Tribute Destinations."
 tributary_events.11.t:0 "The [ningbo_province.GetCapitalName] Incident"
 tributary_events.11.d:0 "We have received word from [Root.Overlord.GetName] that they are imposing restrictions on foreign trade with our country due to our inability to police local factions from misusing the tribute mission flag for their own petty conflicts. Unless we act decisively this is likely to be a problem for years to come."
 tributary_events.11.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 tributary_events.11.b:0 "Compensate [Root.Overlord.GetName] for the inconvenience."
 tributary_events.12.t:0 "Tribute from [ningbo_country.GetName]"
 tributary_events.12.d:0 "An ambassador from [ningbo_country.GetName] has arrived with an enormous gift as compensation for the unpleasantries exchanged in [ningbo_province.GetCapitalName].

 tributary_events.13.d:0 "Our court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] marvels at the great number of exotic goods brought by the tributary mission from [exotic_tributary.GetName]. Enterprising officials and merchants alike have taken note of how sought after these items are and alliances are being formed already. If we don't act quickly it seems all but certain a smuggling ring will be set up to bring more exotic goods to the capital."
 tributary_events.13.a:0 "Allow it but ensure we get a share!"
 tributary_events.13.b:0 "We must impose strict regulations immediately."
 tributary_events.14.t:0 "New Business Opportunities"
 tributary_events.14.d:0 "Ever since we started sending tributes to [Root.Overlord.GetName], the demand for the exotic goods of our artisans has been rather high in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName]. This has led to the growth of a small trade network, which while not entirely legal, has enriched many [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] officials and entrepreneurial [Root.GetAdjective] merchants.\nHaving discovered the size of the operation the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle] has now imposed much stricter regulations to stop what [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetSheHe] considers to be illegal smuggling. Where there is demand it is hard to stop people from trying to make a profit, however..."
 tributary_events.14.a:0 "We must do what we can to aid the [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 tributary_events.14.b:0 "It is time to support the businesses of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName]."
 tributary_events.15.t:0 "[Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] Demand"
 tributary_events.15.d:0 "It seems the arrival of our tribute missions in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName] was quite favorably received. The exotic goods our emissaries brought have led to an increasing demand for [Root.GetAdjective] products. While the business is not quite legal the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] authorities have turned a blind eye, so far."
 tributary_events.15.a:0 "How fortunate!"
 tributary_events.16.t:0 "Political Refugees"
 tributary_events.16.d:0 "Following a lost power struggle a large group of political refugees from the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] [Root.Overlord.GovernmentName] has begun to seek refuge in our country. The conflict seems insignificant enough that the winning side in [Root.Overlord.GetName] isn't particularly interested in searching for their fleeing compatriots, but they may still appreciate if we delivered the refugees to them. On the other hand these are men and women of some ability, who could likely do a lot of good in our country if we allowed them to stay."
 tributary_events.16.a:0 "We can make some room for them..."
 tributary_events.16.b:0 "Send them back to the imperial center."
 tributary_events.17.t:0 "Tributary Eunuchs"
 tributary_events.17.d:0 "With the arrival of this year's tributary missions a great number of eunuchs have joined our ranks. These young men have been identified for their ability and after a minimum of preparation they were sent to live a life in the service of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nSome will serve in our administration while others might even rise to the position of trusted ministers or leaders for our armies and navies."
 tributary_events.17.a:0 "Such dedication is exemplary."
 tributary_events.18.t:0 "Tributary Fleet Beset by Pirates"
 tributary_events.18.d:0 "The regular arrival of tributary fleets bringing treasures from abroad to our shores is in some ways a temptation too great to ignore for those that wish to make a quick fortune. A group of pirates has begun to target the tribute missions and are making a good profit on the many gifts meant for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 tributary_events.18.a:0 "Divert extra resources to protect them."
 tributary_events.18.b:0 "Our navy will make short work of them!"
 tributary_events.19.t:0 "Rewarding Loyalty"
 tributary_events.19.d:0 "[tributary_loyal.GetName] is in many ways the ideal model for a tributary state. Their missions are regular and their obedience has never once been in question.\nOur tributary system provides us with gifts and other tokens of respect from those that we grant our protection but apart from promising to defend them we are expected to take care of them even in other ways. Perhaps it is time to show that loyalty will be rewarded?"
 tributary_events.19.a:0 "We shall send our finest gifts to the [tributary_loyal.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 tributary_events.19.b:0 "Sadly we cannot afford such frivolity."
 tributary_events.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] is willing to hunt Pirates"
 tributary_events.20.d:0 "While they have promised to help clean up the region it is clear that [From.GetName] has over time grown into a major Pirate Haven. We have always known that they are barbarians and hardly worthy of our trust, but the recent actions of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has actually brought our countries closer to each other."
 tributary_events.20.a:0 "We can work with this."
 tributary_events.21.t:0 "[From.GetName] is a Pirate Haven"
 tributary_events.21.d:1 "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has decided to keep harboring a number of well-known pirates. When our local officials demanded that they clean out their ports the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] refused to comply."
 tributary_events.21.a:0 "We need to reconsider their Tributary status."
 tributary_events.22.t:0 "Loyalty Rewarded"
 tributary_events.22.d:0 "As a long time and faithful tributary of [Root.Overlord.GetName] we have been sent an enormous gift. This strengthens our rule internally and will fatten our coffers immensely!"
 tributary_events.22.a:0 "It feels good to be validated."
 tributary_events.23.t:0 "Fortune Seekers"
 tributary_events.23.d:0 "While the annual tributary missions to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] bring both gifts and valuable trading opportunities, they are also a way for enterprising men and women in foreign countries to reach the [Root.GetAdjective] court. Once here they seek employment as a servant of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], hoping for a richer and better life."
 tributary_events.23.a:0 "This is a land of opportunities."

 tributary_events.24.d:0 "By paying tribute to the [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Overlord.GetName] we are part of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] trade sphere and people can travel freely between our countries. Among those that make good use of this opportunity are fortune seekers and adventurers from all over the region.\nThese people have skills, experience and a background unlike most in our own realm and could make a valuable contribution to our cause."

 confucian_events.101.d:0 "“How would you like to work for us?”\n\nVarinna Redwane doesn’t quite know what to do. When the Provost of Thought in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] invited her to meet with him, she expected a lecture or a request for conversion. Redwane-- a fervent paladin and recent migrant to the city-- had made a name for herself as a vociferous defender of Corin and her followers, but she knew the Thoughtful were masters of rhetoric. Since first reading the letter of invitation, she had been splitting her time between administering to the faithful and planning her arguments.\n\nShe prepared defenses of the Pantheon’s existence (that Cannorians only believe in their gods because of verifiable evidence, for how else do you explain clerics and paladins and avatars? How could you be gifted magic by a source that doesn’t exist?), for the Pantheonic Councils’ rigor (since, as places where scholars of magic and religion meet to update the godly canon, the Councils act as scientific conferences in themselves), and more. She expected to be pried open, her words scrutinized for any hint of her gods’ non-divinity. She did not, on the other hand, expect this.\n\nThe Provost passes an unsigned contract over his desk. “It is obvious that Corin is divine. There is too much objective proof of her ascension, and yet the [Root.GetAdjective]-- increasingly Pantheonic in population-- are bereft of her divine magic. You possess not only this magic, but also mastery in eloquence and oratory. We offer you title, rank, payment, and jurisdiction over the followers of Corin in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], as long as you are willing to lecture about her at our University.”\n\n“You want to hire me... to proselytize? You’ll pay me to spread the word of Corin?”\n\n“Yes, that about summarizes the offer.”\n\nWithin ten minutes, Redwane accepts.

 confucian_events.102.d:0 "“4. Lies are the tool of Darkness. They are a mask to hide its evil creatures. Speak openly and clearly, that others may see your light and receive it.”\n\n- Excerpt from “Universal Tenets of the Bulwari Sun Cults.”\n\n“It has been determined that the Theory of Everything fits perfectly within the Light. Lies, of course, are against the Light: and so, as a corollary, truths (and with it, Truth) must fit within its corona. The reason why lying is such an evil to the Light is because it pulls us away from the Truth (i.e., the Light); therefore, being incorrect also does the same. Since evil creatures hide behind masks of falsehoods, those masks exist whether the falsehoods are purposeful or accidental. To be wrong is not nearly as great a sin as lying: to be wrong is merely to believe in a falsehood, while to lie is to knowing bringing others into falsehood with you: and yet, to be wrong is to be within the shadow. Therefore, the more we objectively understand the world, the more we are attuned with Surakel.\n\nWith this, we must understand that the fourth Tenet of the Bulwari Sun Cults has an implied but necessary sub-tenet: ‘Truth is the tool of Light, banishing Darkness wherever it goes. Study the world relentlessly, else, when you speak openly, you may accidentally spread Darkness with statements you do not realize are false. Be always scientific and rational, to ensure the Light may shine through your words.’\n\nSince such a principle is the only logical conclusion of the fourth Tenet of the Bulwari Sun Cults, it is clear that their religions are more than compatible with the Thought. To further Progress, Sentience, and Rationality is to further the Light, and vice versa. May we cooperate extensively now that we know this is the case.”\n\n- Excerpt from “The Thoughtful Tenets of the Bulwari Sun Cults.”"

 confucian_events.103.d:0 "When we first interacted with goblins, some of their shamans adopted new ways of thinking and new hats upon their heads. A cult-- the Cult of Reason-- sprang to life, sporting gnomish thinking-caps and demanding that the world be categorized and understood. The Cult had strange ideas of rationalism: its early theories included “dwarves were created by goblins” and “all life descended from one shared ancestor,” which were seen as mutually-exclusive and quickly caused a schism within their paltry ranks. Without our intervention, the Cult of Reason might have faded into obscurity as just one of the dozens of different goblin cults.\n\nThankfully, we knew an opportunity when we saw one. We immediately began to ship books, funding, resources, and technology to the Reasonable. We elevated their leaders, gave them the finest education, and inculcated them with our theories about the world. While the first years were hard, and these goblins initially struggled to adapt to [Root.GetAdjective] society, our investment in the Cult of Reason has since paid dividends.\n\nWith government support, the Cult has begun to dominate goblin society within our borders. Our workshops, laboratories, and artificeries are now full of goblins, each ready to contribute a glorious idea or invention. We have come to appreciate the Reasonable in their own right: not just as followers of the Thought, but as masters of experimentation. Goblins love to create, build, and artifice, and each of their experiments is more ambitious than the last. Though their tests often fail our safety standards and are hard to reproduce, we cannot deny the efficacy and potential in such industrious research. Between the prudence of the Thoughtful and the creativity of the Reasonable, there is almost nothing we cannot learn!"

 confucian_events.104.d:0 "In 961 AA, while surrounded by gem-adorned statues of himself, Khetarch Baqtkhet I issued a decree to all Kheteratans: “Every household must now feature a shrine of the Khetarch’s likeness.” This caused immediate panic; the statues surrounding Baqtkhet were as large as he was, and each gem set into them would cost more than a peasant’s yearly wage. Thankfully, an unlikely group came to save every pocketbook in the country.\n\nThe Delta Gnomes, having lived in Kheterata since before the fall of the First Hierarchy, began the same process they always undertook when a new decree was announced. By the time the Khetarch’s inspectors came to the Gnomish Quarter, they were faced with a hundred different interpretations of “the Khetarch’s likeness.” One house contained a sandstone cat’s paw, adorned with a single lily; another hosted a granite cat with shiny pebbles on each cheek; another house simply had a housecat, and its owner said it was named after Baqtkhet. Most of these statues (and cats) failed inspection, but others did not. The smallest of the accepted designs-- a circular disc with a two-inch diameter, engraved and painted with a yellow cat’s face-- soon began to be produced en masse. It was distributed throughout the district, and, when an inspector objected to it as not being sufficiently deferential, a gnome would point to the previous official’s approval. Accepting the ruling, the inspector would concede.\n\nThe use of the yellow-cat disc quickly spread beyond the gnomes. Local humans found out about its acceptance, and started making their own; humans in the next city did the same. Within the year, houses all over Kheterata sported the gnomish design. These discs became a symbol not only for the nation, but also for thoughtful Khetism. The laws of the Khet may be Truth, and must be followed: but just because something is Truth does not mean it cannot be examined. All rules are subject to experimentation, interpretation, and studies to test their limits. Long after adopting the local faith, the Delta Gnomes maintain their rationalist spirit."

It mattered not what conflict consumed Rahen, nor what occupation or siege befell Rayavhashapal: every invader, and every attacker, knew the value of the institution. It has been operating for longer than anything the Thoughtful have ever built.\n\nUpon first arriving in the continent of Haless, we immediately sent delegations to the Hall. Seeing ourselves as the next Guru Suhan, we thought we’d bring new philosophies and better ideas: we thought we’d revolutionize the entire institution! We assumed that we knew better than them, or at least more than them, or at least some things that they didn’t. What we didn’t expect was to be outclassed.\n\nWhen a hall operates for four thousand years, in a region with a greater population than five Dragon Coasts, wherein every local lord’s finest scholars study, it becomes a behemoth of information. In our first debates, we couldn’t keep up. They would ask us about a philosophy of theirs, and we did not understand it enough to engage; they would ask us about one of ours, and then they’d rip it to shreds. In these first days, the Raheni won, and we lost. For the first time in a long time, the Thoughtful were not the smartest people in the room.\n\nWe left the Hall shocked... and excited. Even with our abysmal first performance, they were interested in more. They knew of our artificery and our Thought, and they wanted to hear from us. Officially invited back to the Hall of Endless Debate, we now have a chance to research, prepare, and argue. We have finally gained verbal sparring partners worthy of The Thought, and we approach this challenge with zeal.\n\nWe are going to have so much fun with this."

The world around him blurred as he lurched towards the fire along with a group of gnolls who seemed to have caught the same ecstatic affliction, and almost of its own volition saw his hand drift into the flames. Sweating now, with tears in his eyes, he felt himself falling unconscious. Then, a low, guttural laugh… and with a flash, the flames turned green. The pressure valves filled with red, the pipe bolts barely holding as the generator began to spark and spin uncontrollably. With a rasping laugh, the overseer only shouted: “More!”"

 confucian_events.107.d:0 "“When the Thoughtful scholar first came to my workshop, I assumed that he did not understand. He arrived with seven bound notebooks full of prototype Runes, each more complicated and intricate than the last. I let him monologue for about thirty-five minutes about them- many of his designs did have merit, and he was interesting to listen to- before I finally interrupted his excited speech.\n\nI told him that Runecrafting is not just about creation for creation’s sake. To the faithful, it is an art where we honor Urisazirn Mithrilhand, first son of Durvorazir, patron of Runework and wisdom; it is a lifelong pursuit, where we master the ancient runes as they were originally taught. I explained that Runewriting is a religious practice, not a secular one, and it must be treated with the weight it deserves. I told him that I appreciated his enthusiasm, but that he should not be trying to create Runes just because he can.\n\nIn response, dear reader, the scholar surprised me. He agreed with what I had said! He told me how he revered Mithrilhand as someone who did not possess physical strength, and so instead attempted to categorize and document everything that existed. He loved how Mithrilhand wanted to understand Halanna’s plan, how he found the inherent Truths of the world and bound them into Runes that mortal dwarves could use. Then, the Thoughtful man told me that he saw Runes as verifiable language, just as I do. If we say words, they cannot be proven true by speech alone: but if a Rune works, it is necessarily correct in its description of the world, else it would not function. He said he wanted to create Runes to understand everything, and to be able to better serve his community.\n\nI saw too much of my art reflected in him. I agreed to help, and nothing was ever the same.”\n\n- Excerpt from “A Thoughtful Runesmith: A Memoir,” by Ungrim Bronzehand."

 confucian_events.109.d:0 "The life of a Skald Chronicler is an uncommon one: long periods of solitude with the wind as your only companion, followed by a hearty welcome at one of the sparse towns dotting the Gerudian hinterlands. Tharmur Jormanson could see the traces of one such settlement now, a soft glow barely visible through the ever-storming snow. But as much as he would have loved to press forward towards ale and civilization, Tharmur had a duty.\n\nIt took him a while to trudge to the autonomous Skald Organ, audible as a defective croak long before it was visible. These towering organs - built to ease the ceaseless burden of the Skald-priests of old - sounded to prevent the reawakening of the dragon Elkaesal the White. Harboring memories of Dragons as bitter as those of the Gerudians, the Thoughtful soon aided the north in constructing these instruments of unparalleled make and design. The massive wind organs ensured the songs of the Skalds would echo across the mountains of Gerudia incessantly, beacons of reassurance to any wayfarers passing by.\n\nThis particular organ’s intake had frozen over: nothing a few well-placed wrench blows couldn’t fix. After he tuned a few bolts while humming the old skald chants, the eerie ear-splitting  harmonies returned, weaving once more  across the landscape . Finally, Tharmur could finish his journey.\n\nSoon, the townspeople would be celebrating his arrival, enraptured by tales he brought from the furthest corners of Thoughtful lands. He would tell them of the newest Mechanist developments and edicts from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: but also the Beralic Saga, the Winter Lullaby, the Voyage of the Northern Raider… Old stories kept safe in the libraries of Skaldol. Some old religious traditions of the Skalds may have faded into obscurity, but, here, the Chroniclers had taken upon themselves the mantle of an even more important role. History, Tharmur knew, was not just some row of musty tomes in a Nimscodd university. It was living and breathing, and it was in the otherwise barren north where the Skald Chroniclers sang it to life."

 confucian_events.110.d:0 "“CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!?” yells a high-pitched kobold as ecstatic crowds erupt into war-songs. “IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A NEW GAMEMASTER!”\n\nEvery cheer, groan, and song in the amphitheater focuses on the man at the center of it all: Kilrogg Doomwhistle, the thin and wiry half-orc who has just made himself into a hero. He joins for a moment in singing to generations of past and future, before slamming his palms onto the table and grinning at his foe. “Join me!” he says, half-requesting and half-demanding. “We’ve worked towards this for so long. Celebrate along with your son!”\n\nSitting opposite Kilrogg, past the dice, boards, and miniature soldiers, is the wizened old gnome Roythistle Doomwhistle. The ex-general and adoptive father stares almost blankly ahead, still processing that he lost. In all his centuries of warfare-- of fighting in the Dragon Coast, of constant wargaming, of teaching Kilrogg gnomish warfare for the past twenty years-- he had never lost a battle, real nor simulated. Not once. He glances at his exhausted manpower reserves, his devastated industrial capacity, and the thousand-page rulebook which he knows by heart. Then, he starts laughing with glee and epiphany. “You’ve been tricking me for years, haven’t you? You’ve been losing on purpose to keep my guard down!”\n\nKilrogg’s affirmative roar of “All warfare is deception!” drowns out the sounds of his fans. Orcs in the crowd call him a hero, a strategic genius who outsmarted the gnomes at their own type of war. They interweave his name with the chants of old Bulgu; they sing that his tactics will aid not just in the arena, but in outwitting Dookan’s captors and freeing their god. As the Doomwhistle clan embraces one another (partially crushing the gnome in the process), a legend to both orcs and the Thoughtful is born. The lesson, to each group, is clear: enlightenment can come from anywhere."

 confucian_events.111.t:0 "The Compendium of Dragons"
 confucian_events.111.d:0 "Every student in [Root.GetTag.GetName] is assigned a new mandatory reading: The Compendium of Dragons, First Edition. Compiled collaboratively by thousands of scholars, the Compendium aims to detail the actual history of dragons. Combining kobold oral histories, gnomish records from as far back as the Dragonwake, and accounts from Gerudia and the Serpentspine, the book is hailed as a step forward for Halann’s collective knowledge of dragonkind. Its writers have attempted to demystify the Kobold Dragon Cult, exploring each of the thousands of tales about dragons for inconsistencies or corroborations. Finding almost no historically verifiable stories about dragons interacting with kobolds, the First Edition claims that kobolds were not created by dragons, and, rather, simply evolved parallel to them.\n\nThe Compendium immediately causes a firestorm in meeting houses, debate halls, and schools. Within five years, there is a Second Edition, three Rival Editions, and five separate Addendums. Scholars contest whether kobolds were created by dragons or evolved alongside them; whether kobolds are from the Dragonspine or the Serpentspine; what each dragon did, where they are now, and more. Gnomes and kobolds both engage fiercely in this debate, and while kobolds generally argue that they were created by dragons and gnomes generally argue that they were not, these roles are not universal. Interspecies discussions spring up all around the country to debate the historical accuracies of the Dragon Cult.\n\nThrough all of this, the Cult becomes more intertwined with our nation. Dragons lose their status as creatures of myth, and are instead treated as real, corporeal entities whose particulars can be argued over. Clerics give way to scholars, and, piece-by-piece, the Dragon Cult becomes an institution of scholarship just as much as an institution of faith. The Dragons are brought into The Thought."

You cannot practice your way into enlightenment.”\n\nThe doctor frowns. “What, again? But I followed your steps exactly! I do not have the same legs as you, sure, but surely the movements count for something-- now, wait, I have been practicing my way into enlightenment for my entire life, do you know that? It has worked more often than not!”\n\nThe shaman taps her teeth together, then turns the torch downwards and shoves it into the snow. The doctor yelps as the light goes out. “But it will not work here. Stop writing notes! How do you expect to perceive other worlds when you refuse to engage with anything but the material? Tell me: what were you feeling as you moved?”\n\n“In one eye, I saw everything, but in my throat, I was only here. In my arms, I could taste blood, but in my feet, I was devoured. I conceptualized it all, exactly as you told me to! I--”\n\n“No!” She yells, first out of anger, then out of frustration. “That is what I felt in my last vision, not what you should feel. You are nothing but a machine of regurgitation... Do you even understand why I let you witness me?”\n\n“To learn of other worlds!” He proclaims, defensively. “To catalog the stories and visions of every tribe in Aelantir. To bring your words to them, and their words to you, because you are bound to the land, and I am not.”\n\nShe roars in response: “Then stop trying to see it yourself! We can see the Dream, and you cannot. Accept this, doctor: that we will teach you, but only on our terms, and not on yours. If I die before I have read a book of visions from every tribe in Noruin, you have failed. So ensure that you do not fail.”"

 confucian_events.115.d:0 "Soaked in rice wine, Damestear-- known to the Harafic as Kseldosblood-- burns in braziers throughout the lecture hall. Its alcoholic sulfur-scent clings to the air, overwhelming the rosemary which covers the walls. Accompanying these smells is the resonant hum of an automated organ, simulating a synchronous tune first discovered 248 years ago. Ten ruinborn sit in the room, their eyes closed, mimicking this hum. They sit on tiles patterned with geometric waves which tell the stories of gods and origins.\n\nIf the tiles had been painted fifty years ago, they would have only portrayed Kseldos, the water god, bleeding so that mortals could create beautiful inventions from his blood: but now it also shows the Dame in the sky, crying comets of brilliant blue which gift the earth her power. The Harafic know that the Thoughtful do not worship the Dame, but this does not matter to them. Two gods-- one of water, and one of sky-- brought the same substance to the world, thousands of miles apart. Cultures like the Thoughtful and Harafic sprung up around these deposits, and they both understood something fundamental long before they knew of each other: that Kseldosblood, Damestear, is the root of all creation. When they finally met, they embraced like long-lost friends.\n\nTheir collaborations started immediately. The Harafic Kooras were delighted by artificery, and, in turn, told the Thoughtful of the Riftwatchers: the rare ruinborn who could see not just through space, but also through the past, the future, and the Elemental Planes. The Riftwatchers’ powers were inconsistent, but they knew of some conditions that sometimes increased their ability to see other worlds. The Thoughtful began to study, and maximize, these conditions.\n\nThis hall is now host to religious experiment. A thousand studies and rituals use different herbs, sounds, and feelings: but they all lead towards the same goal. The Thoughtful, inch by inch, are turning Riftwatching into a science."

Saplings sprouting in the wrong lighting conditions physically cannot take root; vines manifest to immediately strangle sick animals before they can spread disease; fauna, flora, and fungi work in perfect harmony, for it seems that interspecies competition almost does not exist here. There is only one explanation for an ecosystem that keeps itself so perfectly regulated: the Effelai must be a thinking being.\n\nIt is a mind-- fully sentient, just like us-- with a brain that reaches across thousands of miles and the thinking capacity to match. Its Seedthralls are not hollowed, but rather are people who have become part of this ever-growing mind: and though we do not want to become one with the Effelai, we have attempted to use the Thralls to speak to it. We sing songs to them, bait them with floral pheromones, and offer them gifts of knowledge and insight. We try everything we can to speak with the Effelai. The Effelai does not speak back.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to matter how much we catalog local myths, find the methods which have worked best for communicating with the Effelai for generations, or pay tribute to the land. Nothing we do matters to the Effelai, and we cannot figure out why. We have in front of us a plant which saw the Ashen Skies and has a sentience unlike anything we’ve ever experienced: and we have information it could never obtain otherwise. There is so much potential in a bond between the Thought and the Effelai... but it doesn’t seem to want anything we have. Could a being this powerful not want for rationality, or resources, or interconnection? Does it not dream for anything outside of its own domain? Does it not even desire to learn?\n\nThe locals have found themselves amenable to our rule, but this is little consolation. We have found the most interesting being in the world, and it will not even speak to us."

 confucian_events.117.d:0 "“A State is like a mind,” declares the Kheionist between sips of his tea. “Each piece of knowledge builds towards individual thoughts. We, these knowledges, all have something to contribute: but our collective thoughts can only be expressed by the mind as a whole. This mind, the Kheion, seems to have only one will, though truly that will is faceted by a million inputs. This is why we must have representative government: for otherwise the thoughts created, and the words spoken, by the mind will not dutifully represent the knowledge they should.”\n\n“No, no! The State works best as a machine, picked at and pruned,” responds the Thoughtful. Despite feigning offense, she smiles from ear to ear. “Every worker may contribute, but their inputs are carefully manipulated at each stage of production. If everyone tries putting in their knowledge without oversight, the machine will overheat and explode. But if each person does their part, and each is assigned to the right role, the machine takes the best pieces from everyone. This is why we must have a technocratic government: so that everything works efficiently, and all of society is aided as much as possible. Anything else harms the greater good.”\n\nThe Kheionist shakes his head, biting his lip to hide a grin. “Your technocracy can never truly understand the ‘greater good.’ Your best bureaucrats may know what is the most efficient, but what about the most just? The most equal? How can you help the people of your nation if only the most successful make the decisions?”\n\n“Oh, please!” retorts the Thoughtful. “It’s not like your republics worked any better. Who elevated the Kylakas if not the richest and most powerful? At least we honor merit more than money!”\n\nThe argument continues for hours. They both keep going until the caffeine wears off."

 confucian_events.118.d:0 "Taychendi clans have warred ever since the Ashen Skies, and though each war sees dozens ascend as Heroes, thousands more are simply left to die. According to their faith, the dead reincarnate so that they might be given another chance at ascension... but only so many can become Heroes at once, and the destruction left behind is monumental. We have decided that we can show them a better way.\n\nCombat was never the only way to become a Hero; even in their old stories, a legendary blacksmith or artisan could also ascend. Accordingly, we have framed The Thought as a higher purpose. We now celebrate our dead far more than before, bestowing accolades upon our greatest scholars: we have storied how the Heroes of Thought have improved not only themselves, but also the entire world. By building schools and sewers in their lands, we have shown the Taychendi that there is Heroism in scholarship and science. We have pointed to the lives saved, nations built, and monuments crafted by the powers of Rationalism and Progress. We have given them a different path towards becoming Heroes.\n\nMore than just being receptive, the Taychendi have added their own meaning to our philosophy. Many in their ranks now claim that if one masters Sentience in their life, they ascend into Godhood after death. On the other hand, if they do not, they still have contributed to the whole world’s Sentience through study. Rather than a cycle of Heroes killing one another, then, this new form of Heroism has each new generation building on the successes of the last. The goal of all life becomes maximizing knowledge and progress, and every Hero pushes the whole world forwards. Instead of spilling blood, they build the Theory of Everything."

The figure’s left hand, gloved (or perhaps grown?) in bark and thistle, strokes at their calm smile of amused self-assurance. Immediately recognizing the figure, [Root.Monarch.GetName] attempts to reconcile the advice [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was given over the past few years. A Wood Elf had warned [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to not look them in their eyes, else [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] memories would fade into their Court; an Eordan Ruinborn had told [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to immediately pledge [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire country to them, or at least gift a large library towards their project; a Forest Goblin, on the other hand, had said that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should probably just accept whatever was coming. [Root.Monarch.GetName] decides to stare no higher than the creature’s torso, then begins, “We honor your presence, Steward of Memory, curator of the Bristlecomb Library--”\n\n“I find ‘Steward’ to be a restrictive term, lately. A steward protects, but a curator selects. Sometimes, they must throw exhibits away. Isn’t that sad? The forgotten is found, then is forgotten again.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] pauses. “We honor your presence, Curator of Memory, curator of the Bristlecomb--”\n\n“You don’t have to say curator twice, you know.

[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] lowered eyes do not see the Steward’s smile evolve into a smirk. “We offer you a great hoard of books as offerings towards your Library, so that--”\n\n“I asked you a question.

And if a link cannot withstand the stresses required of it, we will solve it the way we always have. We will cast it back into the crucible and forge a new one.”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s words ring across former Command territory, the [Root.GetAdjective] cog now flapping over conquered Hobgoblin warcamps. Loudspeakers ensure that their words were heard by the Korashi traders, the manufactory workers, and the iron-willed and ironclad hobgoblin artificers patrolling the borders. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] would be lying if they said they didn’t harbour a fascination with the hobgoblin administration that they were here carefully eradicating. Specifically, the Godlost Philosophies.\n\nIt was quite intriguing, really. Complete discipline in the face of any adversity, an almost dogged obedience to authority and loyalty to the nation; the technocratic Hierarchies, in contrast, had always been plagued with certain… inefficiencies. Innovation was the lifeblood of the Thought, but with it came the necessary evil of so-called “free thinkers,” inquisitive minds very useful in the development of new inventions but maintaining an annoying propensity for asking too many questions.

This tome is a monument to our successes: and to our failures. We were treated to millenia-old stories in the ports of Feiten, were given access to Verkal Ozovarian chronicles made by dead dwarven kings, and were exiled from Arawkelin for insufficient deference to local customs. We have seen spirits which only manifest once per century; spirits which force you to forget them; and spirits so protean that they are impossible to describe. But we have also found spirits that can be understood, spoken to, and learned from.\n\nIn this book, you will learn about Ashfellows, delightful creatures which manifest in regularly-used firepits. They are beloved, for they tend to flames: but they also are dangerous, for, if their soot becomes too dense, the Ashfellows might explode! Therefore, you will learn the correct timetables of firepit-cleaning, to ensure a healthy environment for Ashfellows while minimizing the chances of combustion.\n\nYou will also learn of the Torn (sometimes called Bloody Torn), spirits which are found in battlefields gone quiet (or else in sites of grisly murder). While they scream and bleed wherever they go, this grief has been proven to heal the land and restore its balance. They may be hostile if touched, so do not walk close; but appreciate their work, even if they render quiet sleep a distant fantasy.\n\nYou will also learn of Pickpockets, house-spirits which take small items and only rarely give them back. You will learn our tested method of appeasing them: placing a small, shiny pebble in a bronze bowl, and asking the Pickpocket to please make a trade. With a 62.6% success rate over 500 trials, the Pickpocket will likely return your item in return for the pebble.\n\nYou will also learn of Mourning Loves, who appear for the dead which no one grieves.

 shinto_events.17.d:0 "The Ikko communities seem to be here to stay. While we have tried to safeguard our own authority we have also ceded considerable rights and privileges to the Jinaimachi, and it seems likely that they will continue to play a considerable role in our society."
 shinto_events.17.a:0 "Amitabhaya."
 shinto_events.18.t:0 "Support of the Ikko-Ikki"
 shinto_events.18.d:0 "We have continuously patronized the growth of temple communities and therefore we have come to be associated with the Ikko-Ikki. The leaders of the Buddhist temple communities may hold a lot of sway in our society, but they are also the ardent supporters of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 shinto_events.18.a:0 "Amitabhaya."
 shinto_events.19.t:0 "Moral Guidance in an Era of Turmoil"
 shinto_events.19.d:0 "Many of the leading Daimyo in Japan are either self-made men or depend on the loyalty of those who are. Our old moral codes, however, press the importance of lineage and loyalty and a social order based around the Imperial Court. Confucian scholars are now exploring the teachings of Chu Hsi for guidance in the governance of our country.\nThis newfound interest in Neo-Confucianism emphasizes the four books over the archaic classics and attempts to give a rational moral code for local rulers and ordinary men alike."
 shinto_events.19.a:0 "Let us patronize the institutions of the Imperial Court."
 shinto_events.19.b:0 "We should strive to attract the thinkers of this new strand of moral philosophy."
 shinto_events.20.t:0 "Birth and Privilege"
 shinto_events.20.d:0 "The spread of Neo-Confucian ideals in our society has led to a number of men of humble origins rising to positions of intellectual influence. One of the more prominent scholars of this age is himself the son of a Ronin, and along with other Confucian Scholars he is intent on making learning more widely available through public lectures and books written in simple language.\nIn many ways this is a challenge to the old social order, where learning was a privilege reserved for the families of the right lineages."
 shinto_events.20.a:0 "This is an initiative we must support."
 shinto_events.20.b:0 "We cannot allow social order to be threatened in this way!"
 shinto_events.21.t:0 "Meritocracy"
 shinto_events.21.d:0 "From a young age [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been studying Confucian texts and listening to Neo-Confucian Lectures. As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] now has the ability to put many of these philosophical principles to work. An ambitious scheme would be to root out those of little competence who hold influence in our realm solely on the basis of birth and the ancient ties of loyalty between our families.\nOf course our loyal vassals would likely see this as ingratitude and unwarranted hostility."
 shinto_events.21.a:0 "Merit should be the guiding principle."
 shinto_events.21.b:0 "We must support those loyal to us."
 shinto_events.22.t:0 "Neo-Confucian Administration"
 shinto_events.22.d:0 "We have sought a new rulership philosophy in the teachings of Chu Hsi and the Chinese traditions of Neo-Confucianism. Ideals that have proved to be a solid foundation, not only for our bureaucracy, but for our society at large. Rational thought, more widespread literacy and a clearer focus on merit over birth has allowed the [Root.GetAdjective] to build a stronger state in an era of upheaval."
 shinto_events.22.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.23.t:0 "Times are Changing"
 shinto_events.23.d:0 "While the main strand of philosophy was once the transition from Traditional Japanese values to the more rationalist approach of the Chinese, the focus of philosophers and scholars have now moved on to individual responsibility. Too much focus on intellect disregards the actual feelings of love and empathy which are the foundations of a functioning society.\nThe interpretations and discussions of the Analects will likely continue. As they do, however, a much larger segment of society can partake due to the now widespread literacy and familiarity with the Classics and Books."
 shinto_events.23.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.24.t:0 "Traditionalist Administration"
 shinto_events.24.d:0 "While we have listened to new interpretations of Confucian scholars such as Chu Hsi we have not lost focus on the ancient traditions of our people. We have proven that we still value the Imperial Court and the ancient system of titles and loyalties that our ancestors maintained."
 shinto_events.24.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.25.t:0 "Arrival of European Traders"
 shinto_events.25.d:0 "With the arrival of ships from the west we are seeing an influx of highly sought after goods, not only from Europe but also from the various corners of Asia that western traders frequent. Great ships are becoming an increasingly common sight along our coastlines and, for the Daimyo that welcome them, they promise great riches.\nThe captain of such a ship recently arrived in [nanban_traders_here.GetName], asking that we allow them to dock periodically in a nearby harbor to market western goods."
 shinto_events.25.a:0 "Encourage them to make it a permanent stop."
 shinto_events.25.b:0 "We will enforce strict rules for whom they can meet or do business with."
 shinto_events.25.c:0 "We will accept their goods but offer no guarantees in the future."
 shinto_events.26.t:0 "Duplicity among European Traders"
 shinto_events.26.d:0 "Ever since the arrival of the westerners some have regarded them with distrust. Their pockets are deep, their weapons powerful and, to some, their culture seems fascinating. Those that deal with these traders, however, report that the Europeans are constantly plotting against each other. Scarcely a meeting with foreign emissaries goes by in which they do not warn us of some plot or scheme by their adversaries. It is clear we are not dealing with men of honor.\nAs a new group of traders requests that we increase their privileges our advisors caution us to consider the offer carefully."
 shinto_events.26.a:0 "We will allow them to expand their presence."
 shinto_events.26.b:0 "Limit their influence to a few more ports."
 shinto_events.26.c:0 "Their business must be kept limited to [nanban_traders_here.GetCapitalName]."
 shinto_events.27.t:0 "Rangaku"
 shinto_events.27.d:0 "The trade post in [nanban_traders_here.GetName] has started to attract not only merchants but also scholars and intellectuals. To these men the books that the foreigners bring are far more valuable than the goods they wish to sell. The study of western science and culture, Rangaku, is growing into its own discipline, and according to the adherents we have much to learn. Many clerics are skeptical, however, as are some Confucian scholars."
 shinto_events.27.a:0 "We must do our best to encourage dissemination of western science."
 shinto_events.27.b:0 "Their business must be kept limited to [nanban_traders_here.GetCapitalName]."
 shinto_events.28.t:0 "Foreign Influence"
 shinto_events.28.d:0 "Some argue that we are making ourselves too dependent on the foreign traders. Our own artisans are surely no less gifted than those abroad, and instead of spending a fortune importing manufactured goods from the outside world we might produce many of them. We could then profit from their resale, ourselves.\nThe time is not right to stop the trade entirely, but if we put our greatest craftsmen at work we may in time no longer need to await the arrival of the next trade ship quite so anxiously."
 shinto_events.28.a:0 "An excellent investment!"
 shinto_events.28.b:0 "There is no need to attempt what others do better."
 shinto_events.29.t:0 "Kaikoku?"
 shinto_events.29.d:0 "The meeting with the west has been quite a tumultuous encounter, and especially so for the [Root.GetAdjective]! Our efforts to welcome the western traders have brought us an unparalleled insight into European culture and good access to their goods. Enterprising Kokujin and other influentials have begun sending their sons to Europe to study the westerners first hand, trying to uncover as much as possible that we could make use of at home."
 shinto_events.29.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.30.t:0 "Trade with the West"
 shinto_events.30.d:0 "Over time the earnings from trade with the west have decreased from its initial high, but the influx of goods and ideas from these far-away travelers are still changing our society from what it once was. Only time will tell to what extent we might assimilate the ideals of these far-away travelers."
 shinto_events.30.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.31.t:0 "Sakoku?"
 shinto_events.31.d:0 "We have acted forcefully to limit the influence of Western Traders on our society. While trying to cut all contacts off entirely would likely result in smuggling we have restricted the traders to a single port, and we heavily regulate their interaction with the world outside of that point of contact. This way we can partake in what goods (and guns) we wish to acquire while limiting the risks of subversive religious attempts or plotting."
 shinto_events.31.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.32.t:0 "Firearms"
 shinto_events.32.d:0 "With the arrival of western traders the first portable firearms have come to our realm. These weapons are unlike the ones used here, and they promise to revolutionize warfare should they become widespread. Acquiring enough of them is not as straightforward as it might seem, however. The muskets are in great demand among those that have seen their power, but the prospect of what they could do in the hands of our enemies, or even an unruly peasant community, is also quite disturbing.\nAs we start to produce and instruct our soldiers in the use of these arms we will need to decide who will have access to these guns and how many we will make."
 shinto_events.32.a:0 "Strength in numbers! Produce as many as we can."
 shinto_events.32.b:0 "We will make just enough for a small force of trusted men."
 shinto_events.33.t:0 "Dissemination of Firearms"
 shinto_events.33.d:0 "The flintlock muskets brought to us by the foreigners have proven easier to mass produce than we could have hoped. As more and more of our troops can be equipped with these guns it is clear that we will not be able to limit their spread to either our enemies or the common man very effectively. If we really do wish to decrease the firearms in circulation we will have to take very firm action soon."
 shinto_events.33.a:0 "Doing so would only weaken our armies."
 shinto_events.33.b:0 "Ban the use of guns entirely for commoners."
 shinto_events.34.t:0 "Evolution of Arms"
 shinto_events.34.d:0 "With the novelty of firearms wearing off, it has become clear that they are not as efficient as their early proponents claimed. Through training, we might surely increase their efficiency, and some of our smiths have also suggested ways to improve the weapons themselves. Others would argue that we should spend the time of both our smiths and our soldiers on more traditional arms. The weapons of our ancestors still seem most influential in battles, and we would perhaps do well to honor their traditions."
 shinto_events.34.a:0 "We need better guns!"
 shinto_events.34.b:0 "The Sword is mightier than the musket."
 shinto_events.35.t:0 "A Military Revolution"
 shinto_events.35.d:0 "Since the first matchlocks started appearing in our lands they have gone from being a novelty to one of the more common weapons in use. Some even claim we make more and better weapons than their originating countries do. This has placed a dangerous weapon in the hands of anyone who would oppose our rule, but the rapid adoption of the guns has also made our armies a more respected force than many others."
 shinto_events.35.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.36.t:0 "The Musket - A Weapon and a Tool"
 shinto_events.36.d:0 "Since the first matchlocks started appearing in our lands they have gone from being a novelty to one of the more common weapons in use. As the novelty has worn off and other rulers have adopted them, these arms are no longer heralded as a revolution on the battlefield, but they remain with regiments that specialize in their use.\nIn civilian life it has also become customary to use muskets for guards and hunters."
 shinto_events.36.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.37.t:0 "The Power of the Sword"
 shinto_events.37.d:0 "Rather than devote all our energy to the use and spread of firearms we have tried to limit them, and instead encourage the use of sword and spear. Muskets may in time become more commonplace, but for now we still believe that these, classical weapons will bring glory and honor to our realm."
 shinto_events.37.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.38.t:0 "Dainichi?"
 shinto_events.38.d:0 "With the arrival of Europeans we have come into contact with a new culture and a new religion. In some ways it seems similar to ours, but in others it is completely alien to us. A group of men has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], trying to preach the gospel of a Kirishitan god. Their message appears to be very odd, however, likely due to incompetent or ill-willed translators.\nIn their eagerness to secure the patronage of [Root.Monarch.GetName] the missionaries have appeared bearing no gifts and spouting nonsense. This is a grave disrespect to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], yet some would caution that these blunders mean that they are in desperate need of our help."
 shinto_events.38.a:0 "Preposterous! They have no place here!"
 shinto_events.38.b:0 "We will allow them to stay as long as they behave."
 shinto_events.38.c:0 "Let us hear what their God can teach us."
 shinto_events.39.t:0 "Missions in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 shinto_events.39.da:0 "A group of the Kirishitan have arrived at court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] today, asking that they be allowed to create a small community of faithful in our great city. They would then see to the poor and teach those who would listen about their god.\nThe Missionaries also offer to tutor our own [Root.Heir.GetName] in the ways of God, as well as the disciplines of Christian science. The Buddhist clergy, as well as some of our Kokujin, are cautioning us, as they feel this is an affront to our ancient traditions while the traders in our realm hope to secure valuable trade deals with the westerners if we let them stay."

 shinto_events.39.a:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will be happy to learn of their god."

 shinto_events.39.c:0 "We must defend the faith of our ancestors!"
 shinto_events.40.t:0 "Trade Privileges"
 shinto_events.40.d:0 "A group of Christian missionaries have approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] with an offer to divert the great trade ships of their homeland to our ports, if we allow them to create a seaside community for Christian converts. This is an offer that carries considerable worth to our merchants."
 shinto_events.40.a:0 "Let them come!"
 shinto_events.40.b:0 "We cannot allow this."
 shinto_events.41.t:0 "Letter of Recommendation"
 shinto_events.41.d:0 "The Christian missions in our land have behaved well since they came to settle here. They respect the laws and an increasing number of men and women have begun to see the light of their god. Their leader has gained a reputation as an excellent mediator and would likely make a fine minister. He has agreed to this on the condition that we write a letter of recommendation to the other worldly leaders of Japan.\nOf course, our more traditionalist vassals would see his appointment as an offense both to tradition and to themselves. Their self-proclaimed leader would also likely want to take up office, though his talents lie in other areas."
 shinto_events.41.a:0 "Write a letter."
 shinto_events.41.b:0 "We cannot do that."
 shinto_events.42.t:0 "Christianity on Trial"
 shinto_events.42.d:0 "We have been approached by a great number of our most valued Kokujin as well as dignitaries of the temple communities in our lands. They all demand that we look into the subversive qualities of Christianity. They feel this alien religion is destroying our traditions and insulting our ancestors, and they demand that we put the faith on trial, allowing trusted men of honor and quality to look into this."
 shinto_events.42.a:0 "An inquisition they will have, then."
 shinto_events.42.a.tt:0 "Results may vary depending on what the inquisition finds."
 shinto_events.42.b:0 "It is not their place. Mind cannot reason over faith."
 shinto_events.42.b.tt:0 "This will have no direct effect on the outcome of this incident."
 shinto_events.43.t:0 "The Nature of God"
 shinto_events.43.d:0 "The inquisition into the nature of Christianity has taken a most shocking turn, as the judges themselves have returned demanding to be baptized. One is a learned and respected neo-Confucian scholar, another a respected astronomer, and the last one of our most honorable Samurai retainers. As these men were selected as pillars of society this is an unexpected development to us all."
 shinto_events.43.a:0 "We shall have to allow it, then."
 shinto_events.43.b:0 "Preposterous! We must follow the advice of our Kokujin!"
 shinto_events.44.t:0 "Christianity Derided"
 shinto_events.44.d:0 "The inquisition of the nature of Christianity has, not surprisingly, resulted in the religion being found lacking in terms of respect and adherence to the traditions of our culture. The learned and honorable men we put in charge of the investigation have declared that while the religion may seem tempting, it is in reality a danger to our society."
 shinto_events.44.a:0 "This is the land of the Gods!"
 shinto_events.44.b:0 "While we respect their judgment the Christians must stay."
 shinto_events.45.t:0 "Christian Community Attacked"
 shinto_events.45.d:0 "The warehouses of the Christian merchants in [christian_port_event_target.GetName] have caught fire more than once this month, and while the local Samurai claim that this has been a series of unfortunate accidents it seems clear not everyone is as favorably inclined as we are to the arrival of the gaijin on our shores."
 shinto_events.45.a:0 "Conduct an investigation to punish the perpetrators."
 shinto_events.45.b:0 "There is little we can do about accidents."
 shinto_events.46.t:0 "A Break with Tradition?"
 shinto_events.46.d:0 "It is no secret that [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] line have become personally involved with the Christian faith. Over time Christianity has come to overtake the Shinto, Buddhist and Confucian traditions of Japan, and it is the guiding ideology for our state. Now that Japan is a more united and ordered society, perhaps the time has come to complete the transition and adopt Christianity as the religion of our state?"
 shinto_events.46.a:0 "No, we could never turn our back on tradition entirely!"
 shinto_events.46.b:0 "The time has come for change."
 shinto_events.47.t:0 "A Kirishitan Realm"
 shinto_events.47.d:0 "We have taken the followers of the Christian god under our wing and have allowed them the protection of our state. Wherever they go in our realm, everyone knows that these Christians have the right to live, work and proselytize. Christian merchants are a common sight in our cities, and at court it has become an increasingly common religion among our ministers and retainers."
 shinto_events.47.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.48.t:0 "Significant Christian Presence"
 shinto_events.48.d:0 "While we have kept them under watch we have allowed Christian communities to grow in our lands, while protecting their followers from harm. This has allowed us to secure valuable trade deals with their oversea homeland, and has earned us a reputation as a just and fair realm."
 shinto_events.48.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.49.t:0 "Christianity Defeated"
 shinto_events.49.d:0 "We have managed to subvert the dangerous influences of Christianity in our society. We have kept their missionaries at arm's length and closed our realm to their followers, going as far as tracking down any suspected adherents within our borders. As a result we are lauded by both our retainers and the Shinto and Buddhist clergy in our realm as the defender of the way of our ancestors."
 shinto_events.49.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.50.t:0 "The [Root.Overlord.GetName] Shogunate"
 shinto_events.50.d:0 "In an attempt to increase [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority over the Daimyo of Japan, [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetName] has been conducting nation-wide cadastral surveys. This involves measuring and counting all people, resources and ownership relations, and refashioning them according to [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerHis] design. It is a task given by the Emperor to our Shogun, but it is being used to turn long-standing relationships of power on their heads.\nToday the time for such a survey has come for the [Root.GetName] realm. We have been approached by the administrators of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] administration with a proclamation stating that fiefs granted to vassals ultimately belong to the state, and that vassals hold land in trust for the present time only."
 shinto_events.50.a:0 "Nobody will touch my right to collect tax!"
 shinto_events.50.b:0 "Offer to perform such a count and present the result to [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetName]."

 shinto_events.51.t:0 "The Question of Residence"
 shinto_events.51.d:0 "The Shogun has sent word that the Emperor requires our presence near the Imperial Court. Residing in our own court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] will no longer be acceptable all year, and it has been decreed that our family must instead from now on reside in the Imperial Court all year. While this has at times already been the case, this imperial order leaves little room for us to decide for ourselves. [Root.Monarch.GetName] must travel to the court at once or face dire consequences."
 shinto_events.51.a:0 "By all means let us do so."
 shinto_events.51.b:0 "The [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] are weak and weak willed."
 shinto_events.52.t:0 "Appointment to Imperial Office"
 shinto_events.52.d:0 "The Bakufu has sent word that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is expected to serve as an Imperial official. Given the sincerity of the request a refusal would be out of the question, and could even be seen as a sign of outright rebellion and dishonor. It is also clearly a way to achieve prestige and influence for the [Root.GetAdjective], but it is a dangerous honor. The [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] Shogunate has lately been going through officials at an alarming rate. Not content to allow their supporters and loyal retainers to hold high office, they are now dismissing those that do not deliver the results that the Shogun expects. To some this is a system of merit, but to the many officials in Imperial service it means a constant fear of scrutiny."
 shinto_events.52.a:0 "We must serve the Shogun and the Emperor."
 shinto_events.52.b:0 "We cannot partake in this charade, refuse the appointment."
 shinto_events.52.b.tt:0 "[Root.Overlord.GetName] may declare war on [Root.GetName]."

 shinto_events.53.d:0 "Our vassal, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the [From.GetAdjective] has refused an Imperial summons to serve as an official in our administration. A weak excuse was offered, but this is a clear challenge to our authority."
 shinto_events.53.a:0 "We will have to find someone else then."
 shinto_events.53.b:0 "This will not stand, we must punish the [From.GetAdjective]!"
 shinto_events.54.t:0 "The [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] Back Down"
 shinto_events.54.d:0 "Proving [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] to be as weak as we suspected, the [Root.Overlord.GetName] Shogun has agreed to back down from the demand of service. They have sent the order to fill the position we refused to someone else, but their authority is severely weakened as anyone could see the effect of our refusal."
 shinto_events.54.a:0 "Let their weakness be apparent to all!"
 shinto_events.55.t:0 "Adherence to the Bakufu"
 shinto_events.55.d:0 "Our policy of loyalty and acquiescence as the Shogunate strengthens its grip over Japan has earned us the trust and loyalty of the Imperial court.

 shinto_events.55.a:0 "We remain the loyal servants of the Son of Heaven."
 shinto_events.56.t:0 "Growing Power of the Shogunate"
 shinto_events.56.d:0 "We have tried to steer a middle route as the Shogunate attempts to strengthen its grip over the Empire. While we are not counted among the most disloyal vassals of the Emperor, we are also not part of the group closest to the administration. This has allowed us to preserve our independence while also benefitting from the law, order and safety that the new times bring."
 shinto_events.56.a:0 "We will continue to preserve our room for maneuver."
 shinto_events.57.t:0 "Fragmentation of Shogunate Power"
 shinto_events.57.d:0 "Our policy of actively asserting our independence and relying on alternative local authority rather than playing along with the machinations of the Shogunate has earned us a reputation as a fiercely independent and powerful Daimyo. Our word carries respect, and our actions resonate with many of the Daimyo and Kokujin in Japan who wish to push the limit of their vassalage. By actively undermining Imperial authority we are quickly building a power base of our own."
 shinto_events.57.a:0 "Actions speak louder than words."
 shinto_events.58.t:0 "The Amida Buddha"
 shinto_events.58.d:1 "Our long-standing support of the Ikko-Ikki has not been without friction and in many situations it is as if there are two parallel authorities in Japan. Still, the Ikko-Ikki would arguably not have come as far as they have without our protection according to many.\nWith times of civil strife behind us many expect us to elevate the leaders of the Ikko-Ikki to high positions and make their faith more officially sponsored by the state. To many this would be a grave insult to our old traditions, however..."
