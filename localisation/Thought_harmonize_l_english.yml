 thought_harmonize.11.t:0 "Concept of The Theory of Everything"
 thought_harmonize.11.d:0 "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate concepts from The Thought in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of The Theory of Everything with their own faith. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of concepts from The Thought, constants and classical teaching in their theology. There is some debate in the palace halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves from obscurantism to Rationalism."
 thought_harmonize.11.a:0 "We must teach them the proper ways!"
 thought_harmonize.11.b:0 "Let us accommodate this abstraction."
 thought_harmonize.12.t:0 "Translations of the Classics"
 thought_harmonize.12.d:1 "The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s are a people with strong traditions and rites and their adherence to the archaic language of their own teachings is holding them back from progressing towards civilization. If they are to ever elevate themselves beyond  the obscurantism of this world we must perhaps ensure that the classics are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of The Thought?"
 thought_harmonize.12.a:0 "Let them create their own version of proper form."
 thought_harmonize.12.b:0 "This would be a travesty on our ideology!"

 thought_harmonize.13.d:0 "Our trusted minister and confidant, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has worked closely with our [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] community in order to help them elevate their parochial culture. Surprised at [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has been taken in by [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ways. Some even claim that our [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] has secretly become more spiritual, shaming [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] ancestors and the [Root.GovernmentName] alike."

 thought_harmonize.14.t:0 "Rights and Rite"
 thought_harmonize.14.d:1 "While they are part of our [Root.GovernmentName] some [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] traditions can be very hard to stomach. A civilized people are supposed to abide by what is right and logical according to teachings of The Thought, but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction of such rules. Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their parochial ways."
 thought_harmonize.14.a:0 "Parochials!"
 thought_harmonize.14.b:0 "Such minor things do not concern us."
 thought_harmonize.15.t:0 "Empowering the Office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 thought_harmonize.15.d:0 "While the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] are parochials, they have some customs and rites that we might make use of. As their traditions and ceremonies regarding community already contain a concept of a mutual benefit similar to our [Root.GovernmentName], this is something we could make good use of. Local officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have already been doing so, but it has been suggested that we make use of [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ceremonies even at higher levels. Others argue that we would be shaming our ancestors and turning our back on what is proper if we allowed these tenets to contaminate ours."
 thought_harmonize.15.a:0 "I like the sound of this..."
 thought_harmonize.15.b:0 "It is the shameful officials we need to deal with!"
 thought_harmonize.16.t:0 "Bringing Civilization to the Parochials"
 thought_harmonize.16.d:2 "Over time the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s have come to take on many of our customs. When our [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] visited the area of [harmonization_province.GetName] [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] found that they are still far from civilized, however, and when a local influential landholder invited [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim] to participate in a lecture about the origin of Halann. [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] returned from the area with a very low opinion of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s and of their prospects to ever count themselves among the civilized people of the world."
 thought_harmonize.16.a:0 "We will leave them to their own devices then."
 thought_harmonize.16.b:0 "Let us send our best and brightest to civilize them."
 thought_harmonize.17.t:0 "[harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] Civilization"
 thought_harmonize.17.d:2 "Some parochials are more susceptible to reason and intellect than others. The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s of [harmonization_province.GetName] have already taken to many of our traditions, from the more important to even minor things. Visiting foreigners have a hard time telling the region apart from [Root.GetName] proper as apart from some minor eccentricities the [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName] language, names and customs seem as [Root.GetAdjective] as any part of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName]."
 thought_harmonize.17.a:0 "Progress!"
 thought_harmonize.17.b:0 "We must use this opportunity regionally!"
 thought_harmonize.18.t:0 "Hedonist Heir?"
 thought_harmonize.18.d:0 "The rule of our great [Root.GovernmentName] is the foremost responsibility and privilege of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] have in the past prided themselves on leading through example, observing strict etiquette, personal austerity and carefully weeding out those that do not conform to this ideal. \nIt is therefore with a heavy heart that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has observed the development of [Root.Heir.GetName]. Far from an ideal [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] our imperial heir is often described by [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] teachers as a petty person, focused on immediate gain and emotional pleasures, and [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is a notorious follower and patron of irrational fads and spiritualist bunkum. There are however factions at court that would be most dismayed if we abandoned [Root.Heir.GetName], and a new heir would not have their support."
 thought_harmonize.18.a:0 "Such a [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] is not fit for the Greater Good."
 thought_harmonize.18.b:0 "We need the support of the factions behind the [Root.Heir.GetTitle]."
 thought_harmonize.19.t:1 "Popular Novel"
 thought_harmonize.19.d:1 "A vernacular novel about a well known story from the [Root.GetOldEra] era is rapidly gaining popularity among our subjects. This in itself is not a problem, but it has come to our attention that this novelization is in fact breaking central tenets of The Thought as it could be seen as an argument for disobeying central authority and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Our administrators now argue that the book must be banned, though some fear this will only make it more alluring to those that wish to read it."
 thought_harmonize.19.a:1 "It must be banned immediately."
 thought_harmonize.19.b:1 "We lead by example not decree. Let it be."
 thought_harmonize.20.t:1 "Civil Service"
 thought_harmonize.20.d:1 "Education, self improvement and adherence to the Theory of Everything is the backbone of The Thought and if our [Root.GovernmentName] is to aspire to greatness we must at all times devote money, attention and energy to ensuring that our officials are as well-educated and well-informed as they can possibly be. It is therefore of some concern that the number of people seeking government employment seems to be decreasing as of late."
 thought_harmonize.20.a:1 "We must expand the bureaucracy!"
 thought_harmonize.20.b:0 "There is no need to reinforce the cadres just yet."

 thought_harmonize.101.d:0 "“How would you like to work for us?”\n\nVarinna Redwane doesn’t quite know what to do. When the Provost of Thought in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] invited her to meet with him, she expected a lecture or a request for conversion. Redwane-- a fervent paladin and recent migrant to the city-- had made a name for herself as a vociferous defender of Corin and her followers, but she knew the Thoughtful were masters of rhetoric. Since first reading the letter of invitation, she had been splitting her time between administering to the faithful and planning her arguments.\n\nShe prepared defenses of the Pantheon’s existence (that Cannorians only believe in their gods because of verifiable evidence, for how else do you explain clerics and paladins and avatars? How could you be gifted magic by a source that doesn’t exist?), for the Pantheonic Councils’ rigor (since, as places where scholars of magic and religion meet to update the godly canon, the Councils act as scientific conferences in themselves), and more. She expected to be pried open, her words scrutinized for any hint of her gods’ non-divinity. She did not, on the other hand, expect this.\n\nThe Provost passes an unsigned contract over his desk. “It is obvious that Corin is divine. There is too much objective proof of her ascension, and yet the [Root.GetAdjective]-- increasingly Pantheonic in population-- are bereft of her divine magic. You possess not only this magic, but also mastery in eloquence and oratory. We offer you title, rank, payment, and jurisdiction over the followers of Corin in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], as long as you are willing to lecture about her at our University.”\n\n“You want to hire me... to proselytize? You’ll pay me to spread the word of Corin?”\n\n“Yes, that about summarizes the offer.”\n\nWithin ten minutes, Redwane accepts. She has no idea that in half an hour, the Provost will be offering the same deal to an Adeanic cleric. The two will soon be forced to become coworkers."

 thought_harmonize.102.t:0 "Interpretations of the Light"
 thought_harmonize.102.d:0 "“4. Lies are the tool of Darkness. They are a mask to hide its evil creatures. Speak openly and clearly, that others may see your light and receive it.”\n\n- Excerpt from “Universal Tenets of the Bulwari Sun Cults.”\n\n“It has been determined that the Theory of Everything fits perfectly within the Light. Lies, of course, are against the Light: and so, as a corollary, truths (and with it, Truth) must fit within its corona. The reason why lying is such an evil to the Light is because it pulls us away from the Truth (i.e., the Light); therefore, being incorrect also does the same. Since evil creatures hide behind masks of falsehoods, those masks exist whether the falsehoods are purposeful or accidental. To be wrong is not nearly as great a sin as lying: to be wrong is merely to believe in a falsehood, while to lie is to knowing bringing others into falsehood with you: and yet, to be wrong is to be within the shadow. Therefore, the more we objectively understand the world, the more we are attuned with Surakel.\n\nWith this, we must understand that the fourth Tenet of the Bulwari Sun Cults has an implied but necessary sub-tenet: ‘Truth is the tool of Light, banishing Darkness wherever it goes. Study the world relentlessly, else, when you speak openly, you may accidentally spread Darkness with statements you do not realize are false. Be always scientific and rational, to ensure the Light may shine through your words.’\n\nSince such a principle is the only logical conclusion of the fourth Tenet of the Bulwari Sun Cults, it is clear that their religions are more than compatible with the Thought. To further Progress, Sentience, and Rationality is to further the Light, and vice versa. May we cooperate extensively now that we know this is the case.”\n\n- Excerpt from “The Thoughtful Tenets of the Bulwari Sun Cults.”"

 thought_harmonize.103.t:0 "The Cult of Reason"
 thought_harmonize.103.d:0 "When we first interacted with goblins, some of their shamans adopted new ways of thinking and new hats upon their heads. A cult-- the Cult of Reason-- sprang to life, sporting gnomish thinking-caps and demanding that the world be categorized and understood. The Cult had strange ideas of rationalism: its early theories included “dwarves were created by goblins” and “all life descended from one shared ancestor,” which were seen as mutually-exclusive and quickly caused a schism within their paltry ranks. Without our intervention, the Cult of Reason might have faded into obscurity as just one of the dozens of different goblin cults.\n\nThankfully, we knew an opportunity when we saw one. We immediately began to ship books, funding, resources, and technology to the Reasonable. We elevated their leaders, gave them the finest education, and inculcated them with our theories about the world. While the first years were hard, and these goblins initially struggled to adapt to [Root.GetAdjective] society, our investment in the Cult of Reason has since paid dividends.\n\nWith government support, the Cult has begun to dominate goblin society within our borders. Our workshops, laboratories, and artificeries are now full of goblins, each ready to contribute a glorious idea or invention. We have come to appreciate the Reasonable in their own right: not just as followers of the Thought, but as masters of experimentation. Goblins love to create, build, and artifice, and each of their experiments is more ambitious than the last. Though their tests often fail our safety standards and are hard to reproduce, we cannot deny the efficacy and potential in such industrious research. Between the prudence of the Thoughtful and the creativity of the Reasonable, there is almost nothing we cannot learn!"

 thought_harmonize.104.d:0 "In 961 AA, while surrounded by gem-adorned statues of himself, Khetarch Baqtkhet I issued a decree to all Kheteratans: “Every household must now feature a shrine of the Khetarch’s likeness.” This caused immediate panic; the statues surrounding Baqtkhet were as large as he was, and each gem set into them would cost more than a peasant’s yearly wage. Thankfully, an unlikely group came to save every pocketbook in the country.\n\nThe Delta Gnomes, having lived in Kheterata since before the fall of the First Hierarchy, began the same process they always undertook when a new decree was announced. By the time the Khetarch’s inspectors came to the Gnomish Quarter, they were faced with a hundred different interpretations of “the Khetarch’s likeness.” One house contained a sandstone cat’s paw, adorned with a single lily; another hosted a granite cat with shiny pebbles on each cheek; another house simply had a housecat, and its owner said it was named after Baqtkhet. Most of these statues (and cats) failed inspection, but others did not. The smallest of the accepted designs-- a circular disc with a two-inch diameter, engraved and painted with a yellow cat’s face-- soon began to be produced en masse. It was distributed throughout the district, and, when an inspector objected to it as not being sufficiently deferential, a gnome would point to the previous official’s approval. Accepting the ruling, the inspector would concede.\n\nThe use of the yellow-cat disc quickly spread beyond the gnomes. Local humans found out about its acceptance, and started making their own; humans in the next city did the same. Within the year, houses all over Kheterata sported the gnomish design. These discs became a symbol not only for the nation, but also for thoughtful Khetism. The laws of the Khet may be Truth, and must be followed: but just because something is Truth does not mean it cannot be examined. All rules are subject to experimentation, interpretation, and studies to test their limits. Long after adopting the local faith, the Delta Gnomes maintain their rationalist spirit."

 thought_harmonize.105.t:0 "Losing a Debate"
 thought_harmonize.105.d:0 "The Hall of Endless Debate is older than the original Gnomish Hierarchy, and unlike that old Thoughtful state, its debates have never been interrupted. It mattered not what conflict consumed Rahen, nor what occupation or siege befell Rayavhashapal: every invader, and every attacker, knew the value of the institution. It has been operating for longer than anything the Thoughtful have ever built.\n\nUpon first arriving in the continent of Haless, we immediately sent delegations to the Hall. Seeing ourselves as the next Guru Suhan, we thought we’d bring new philosophies and better ideas: we thought we’d revolutionize the entire institution! We assumed that we knew better than them, or at least more than them, or at least some things that they didn’t. What we didn’t expect was to be outclassed.\n\nWhen a hall operates for four thousand years, in a region with a greater population than five Dragon Coasts, wherein every local lord’s finest scholars study, it becomes a behemoth of information. In our first debates, we couldn’t keep up. They would ask us about a philosophy of theirs, and we did not understand it enough to engage; they would ask us about one of ours, and then they’d rip it to shreds. In these first days, the Raheni won, and we lost. For the first time in a long time, the Thoughtful were not the smartest people in the room.\n\nWe left the Hall shocked... and excited. Even with our abysmal first performance, they were interested in more. They knew of our artificery and our Thought, and they wanted to hear from us. Officially invited back to the Hall of Endless Debate, we now have a chance to research, prepare, and argue. We have finally gained verbal sparring partners worthy of The Thought, and we approach this challenge with zeal.\n\nWe are going to have so much fun with this."

 thought_harmonize.106.d:0 "“We Artificers have always sought to harness the forces of nature for their own means. Our ancestors did it with steam, and later damestear: it has brought us nothing but prosperity as we pushed the boundaries of what others thought possible. This will be no different.”\n\nThe Xhazobkult shaman only gave the Thoughtful overseer a toothy grin. “The souls, do you have them?”\n\n“Yes, we have acquired that which you need for your… ritual. I hope this is not a waste of our time.”\n\nThe Gnoll eyes the overseer with an intense stare. “Ever the arrogant ones, you Thoughtful.”\n\nWithout waiting for a reply, they struck the ground with a torch and sauntered over to a massive brass-rimmed furnace, slamming open the hatch and tossing in the lit torch.\n\nExcitement coursed through the crowd as the furnace began to roar and piping began to whistle, the crucible nurturing a fire hotter than any pile of sticks.\n\nYowls and chants arose from the onlookers as condemned after condemned were herded towards the flamed. The [Root.GetAdjective] remained stone faced throughout the ordeal, even as the line began to shrink - when the last few stood before the fire, he turned with an exasperated sigh.\n\n“You need more? I knew this- AHH!”\n\nHis complaint was cut short by a searing pain in his chest, shortly thereafter wracking his entire body. The world around him blurred as he lurched towards the fire along with a group of gnolls who seemed to have caught the same ecstatic affliction, and almost of its own volition saw his hand drift into the flames. Sweating now, with tears in his eyes, he felt himself falling unconscious. Then, a low, guttural laugh… and with a flash, the flames turned green. The pressure valves filled with red, the pipe bolts barely holding as the generator began to spark and spin uncontrollably. With a rasping laugh, the overseer only shouted: “More!”"

 thought_harmonize.107.d:0 "“When the Thoughtful scholar first came to my workshop, I assumed that he did not understand. He arrived with seven bound notebooks full of prototype Runes, each more complicated and intricate than the last. I let him monologue for about thirty-five minutes about them- many of his designs did have merit, and he was interesting to listen to- before I finally interrupted his excited speech.\n\nI told him that Runecrafting is not just about creation for creation’s sake. To the faithful, it is an art where we honor Urisazirn Mithrilhand, first son of Durvorazir, patron of Runework and wisdom; it is a lifelong pursuit, where we master the ancient runes as they were originally taught. I explained that Runewriting is a religious practice, not a secular one, and it must be treated with the weight it deserves. I told him that I appreciated his enthusiasm, but that he should not be trying to create Runes just because he can.\n\nIn response, dear reader, the scholar surprised me. He agreed with what I had said! He told me how he revered Mithrilhand as someone who did not possess physical strength, and so instead attempted to categorize and document everything that existed. He loved how Mithrilhand wanted to understand Halanna’s plan, how he found the inherent Truths of the world and bound them into Runes that mortal dwarves could use. Then, the Thoughtful man told me that he saw Runes as verifiable language, just as I do. If we say words, they cannot be proven true by speech alone: but if a Rune works, it is necessarily correct in its description of the world, else it would not function. He said he wanted to create Runes to understand everything, and to be able to better serve his community.\n\nI saw too much of my art reflected in him. I agreed to help, and nothing was ever the same.”\n\n- Excerpt from “A Thoughtful Runesmith: A Memoir,” by Ungrim Bronzehand."

 thought_harmonize.109.d:0 "The life of a Skald Chronicler is an uncommon one: long periods of solitude with the wind as your only companion, followed by a hearty welcome at one of the sparse towns dotting the Gerudian hinterlands. Tharmur Jormanson could see the traces of one such settlement now, a soft glow barely visible through the ever-storming snow. But as much as he would have loved to press forward towards ale and civilization, Tharmur had a duty.\n\nIt took him a while to trudge to the autonomous Skald Organ, audible as a defective croak long before it was visible. These towering organs - built to ease the ceaseless burden of the Skald-priests of old - sounded to prevent the reawakening of the dragon Elkaesal the White. Harboring memories of Dragons as bitter as those of the Gerudians, the Thoughtful soon aided the north in constructing these instruments of unparalleled make and design. The massive wind organs ensured the songs of the Skalds would echo across the mountains of Gerudia incessantly, beacons of reassurance to any wayfarers passing by.\n\nThis particular organ’s intake had frozen over: nothing a few well-placed wrench blows couldn’t fix. After he tuned a few bolts while humming the old skald chants, the eerie ear-splitting  harmonies returned, weaving once more  across the landscape . Finally, Tharmur could finish his journey.\n\nSoon, the townspeople would be celebrating his arrival, enraptured by tales he brought from the furthest corners of Thoughtful lands. He would tell them of the newest Mechanist developments and edicts from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: but also the Beralic Saga, the Winter Lullaby, the Voyage of the Northern Raider… Old stories kept safe in the libraries of Skaldol. Some old religious traditions of the Skalds may have faded into obscurity, but, here, the Chroniclers had taken upon themselves the mantle of an even more important role. History, Tharmur knew, was not just some row of musty tomes in a Nimscodd university. It was living and breathing, and it was in the otherwise barren north where the Skald Chroniclers sang it to life."

 thought_harmonize.110.d:0 "“CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!?” yells a high-pitched kobold as ecstatic crowds erupt into war-songs. “IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A NEW GAMEMASTER!”\n\nEvery cheer, groan, and song in the amphitheater focuses on the man at the center of it all: Kilrogg Doomwhistle, the thin and wiry half-orc who has just made himself into a hero. He joins for a moment in singing to generations of past and future, before slamming his palms onto the table and grinning at his foe. “Join me!” he says, half-requesting and half-demanding. “We’ve worked towards this for so long. Celebrate along with your son!”\n\nSitting opposite Kilrogg, past the dice, boards, and miniature soldiers, is the wizened old gnome Roythistle Doomwhistle. The ex-general and adoptive father stares almost blankly ahead, still processing that he lost. In all his centuries of warfare-- of fighting in the Dragon Coast, of constant wargaming, of teaching Kilrogg gnomish warfare for the past twenty years-- he had never lost a battle, real nor simulated. Not once. He glances at his exhausted manpower reserves, his devastated industrial capacity, and the thousand-page rulebook which he knows by heart. Then, he starts laughing with glee and epiphany. “You’ve been tricking me for years, haven’t you? You’ve been losing on purpose to keep my guard down!”\n\nKilrogg’s affirmative roar of “All warfare is deception!” drowns out the sounds of his fans. Orcs in the crowd call him a hero, a strategic genius who outsmarted the gnomes at their own type of war. They interweave his name with the chants of old Bulgu; they sing that his tactics will aid not just in the arena, but in outwitting Dookan’s captors and freeing their god. As the Doomwhistle clan embraces one another (partially crushing the gnome in the process), a legend to both orcs and the Thoughtful is born. The lesson, to each group, is clear: enlightenment can come from anywhere."

 thought_harmonize.111.d:0 "Every student in [Root.GetTag.GetName] is assigned a new mandatory reading: The Compendium of Dragons, First Edition. Compiled collaboratively by thousands of scholars, the Compendium aims to detail the actual history of dragons. Combining kobold oral histories, gnomish records from as far back as the Dragonwake, and accounts from Gerudia and the Serpentspine, the book is hailed as a step forward for Halann’s collective knowledge of dragonkind. Its writers have attempted to demystify the Kobold Dragon Cult, exploring each of the thousands of tales about dragons for inconsistencies or corroborations. Finding almost no historically verifiable stories about dragons interacting with kobolds, the First Edition claims that kobolds were not created by dragons, and, rather, simply evolved parallel to them.\n\nThe Compendium immediately causes a firestorm in meeting houses, debate halls, and schools. Within five years, there is a Second Edition, three Rival Editions, and five separate Addendums. Scholars contest whether kobolds were created by dragons or evolved alongside them; whether kobolds are from the Dragonspine or the Serpentspine; what each dragon did, where they are now, and more. Gnomes and kobolds both engage fiercely in this debate, and while kobolds generally argue that they were created by dragons and gnomes generally argue that they were not, these roles are not universal. Interspecies discussions spring up all around the country to debate the historical accuracies of the Dragon Cult.\n\nThrough all of this, the Cult becomes more intertwined with our nation. Dragons lose their status as creatures of myth, and are instead treated as real, corporeal entities whose particulars can be argued over. Clerics give way to scholars, and, piece-by-piece, the Dragon Cult becomes an institution of scholarship just as much as an institution of faith. The Dragons are brought into The Thought."

You cannot practice your way into enlightenment.”\n\nThe doctor frowns. “What, again? But I followed your steps exactly! I do not have the same legs as you, sure, but surely the movements count for something-- now, wait, I have been practicing my way into enlightenment for my entire life, do you know that? It has worked more often than not!”\n\nThe shaman taps her teeth together, then turns the torch downwards and shoves it into the snow. The doctor yelps as the light goes out. “But it will not work here. Stop writing notes! How do you expect to perceive other worlds when you refuse to engage with anything but the material? Tell me: what were you feeling as you moved?”\n\n“In one eye, I saw everything, but in my throat, I was only here. In my arms, I could taste blood, but in my feet, I was devoured. I conceptualized it all, exactly as you told me to! I--”\n\n“No!” She yells, first out of anger, then out of frustration. “That is what I felt in my last vision, not what you should feel. You are nothing but a machine of regurgitation... Do you even understand why I let you witness me?”\n\n“To learn of other worlds!” He proclaims, defensively. “To catalog the stories and visions of every tribe in Aelantir. To bring your words to them, and their words to you, because you are bound to the land, and I am not.”\n\nShe roars in response: “Then stop trying to see it yourself! We can see the Dream, and you cannot. Accept this, doctor: that we will teach you, but only on our terms, and not on yours. If I die before I have read a book of visions from every tribe in Noruin, you have failed. So ensure that you do not fail.”"

 thought_harmonize.115.d:0 "Soaked in rice wine, Damestear-- known to the Harafic as Kseldosblood-- burns in braziers throughout the lecture hall. Its alcoholic sulfur-scent clings to the air, overwhelming the rosemary which covers the walls. Accompanying these smells is the resonant hum of an automated organ, simulating a synchronous tune first discovered 248 years ago. Ten ruinborn sit in the room, their eyes closed, mimicking this hum. They sit on tiles patterned with geometric waves which tell the stories of gods and origins.\n\nIf the tiles had been painted fifty years ago, they would have only portrayed Kseldos, the water god, bleeding so that mortals could create beautiful inventions from his blood: but now it also shows the Dame in the sky, crying comets of brilliant blue which gift the earth her power. The Harafic know that the Thoughtful do not worship the Dame, but this does not matter to them. Two gods-- one of water, and one of sky-- brought the same substance to the world, thousands of miles apart. Cultures like the Thoughtful and Harafic sprung up around these deposits, and they both understood something fundamental long before they knew of each other: that Kseldosblood, Damestear, is the root of all creation. When they finally met, they embraced like long-lost friends.\n\nTheir collaborations started immediately. The Harafic Kooras were delighted by artificery, and, in turn, told the Thoughtful of the Riftwatchers: the rare ruinborn who could see not just through space, but also through the past, the future, and the Elemental Planes. The Riftwatchers’ powers were inconsistent, but they knew of some conditions that sometimes increased their ability to see other worlds. The Thoughtful began to study, and maximize, these conditions.\n\nThis hall is now host to religious experiment. A thousand studies and rituals use different herbs, sounds, and feelings: but they all lead towards the same goal. The Thoughtful, inch by inch, are turning Riftwatching into a science."

 thought_harmonize.116.d:0 "The continent-spanning Effelai jungle grows too efficiently. Saplings sprouting in the wrong lighting conditions physically cannot take root; vines manifest to immediately strangle sick animals before they can spread disease; fauna, flora, and fungi work in perfect harmony, for it seems that interspecies competition almost does not exist here. There is only one explanation for an ecosystem that keeps itself so perfectly regulated: the Effelai must be a thinking being.\n\nIt is a mind-- fully sentient, just like us-- with a brain that reaches across thousands of miles and the thinking capacity to match. Its Seedthralls are not hollowed, but rather are people who have become part of this ever-growing mind: and though we do not want to become one with the Effelai, we have attempted to use the Thralls to speak to it. We sing songs to them, bait them with floral pheromones, and offer them gifts of knowledge and insight. We try everything we can to speak with the Effelai. The Effelai does not speak back.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to matter how much we catalog local myths, find the methods which have worked best for communicating with the Effelai for generations, or pay tribute to the land. Nothing we do matters to the Effelai, and we cannot figure out why. We have in front of us a plant which saw the Ashen Skies and has a sentience unlike anything we’ve ever experienced: and we have information it could never obtain otherwise. There is so much potential in a bond between the Thought and the Effelai... but it doesn’t seem to want anything we have. Could a being this powerful not want for rationality, or resources, or interconnection? Does it not dream for anything outside of its own domain? Does it not even desire to learn?\n\nThe locals have found themselves amenable to our rule, but this is little consolation. We have found the most interesting being in the world, and it will not even speak to us."

 thought_harmonize.117.t:0 "A Pleasant Debate"
 thought_harmonize.117.d:0 "“A State is like a mind,” declares the Kheionist between sips of his tea. “Each piece of knowledge builds towards individual thoughts. We, these knowledges, all have something to contribute: but our collective thoughts can only be expressed by the mind as a whole. This mind, the Kheion, seems to have only one will, though truly that will is faceted by a million inputs. This is why we must have representative government: for otherwise the thoughts created, and the words spoken, by the mind will not dutifully represent the knowledge they should.”\n\n“No, no! The State works best as a machine, picked at and pruned,” responds the Thoughtful. Despite feigning offense, she smiles from ear to ear. “Every worker may contribute, but their inputs are carefully manipulated at each stage of production. If everyone tries putting in their knowledge without oversight, the machine will overheat and explode. But if each person does their part, and each is assigned to the right role, the machine takes the best pieces from everyone. This is why we must have a technocratic government: so that everything works efficiently, and all of society is aided as much as possible. Anything else harms the greater good.”\n\nThe Kheionist shakes his head, biting his lip to hide a grin. “Your technocracy can never truly understand the ‘greater good.’ Your best bureaucrats may know what is the most efficient, but what about the most just? The most equal? How can you help the people of your nation if only the most successful make the decisions?”\n\n“Oh, please!” retorts the Thoughtful. “It’s not like your republics worked any better. Who elevated the Kylakas if not the richest and most powerful? At least we honor merit more than money!”\n\nThe argument continues for hours. They both keep going until the caffeine wears off."

 thought_harmonize.118.d:0 "Taychendi clans have warred ever since the Ashen Skies, and though each war sees dozens ascend as Heroes, thousands more are simply left to die. According to their faith, the dead reincarnate so that they might be given another chance at ascension... but only so many can become Heroes at once, and the destruction left behind is monumental. We have decided that we can show them a better way.\n\nCombat was never the only way to become a Hero; even in their old stories, a legendary blacksmith or artisan could also ascend. Accordingly, we have framed The Thought as a higher purpose. We now celebrate our dead far more than before, bestowing accolades upon our greatest scholars: we have storied how the Heroes of Thought have improved not only themselves, but also the entire world. By building schools and sewers in their lands, we have shown the Taychendi that there is Heroism in scholarship and science. We have pointed to the lives saved, nations built, and monuments crafted by the powers of Rationalism and Progress. We have given them a different path towards becoming Heroes.\n\nMore than just being receptive, the Taychendi have added their own meaning to our philosophy. Many in their ranks now claim that if one masters Sentience in their life, they ascend into Godhood after death. On the other hand, if they do not, they still have contributed to the whole world’s Sentience through study. Rather than a cycle of Heroes killing one another, then, this new form of Heroism has each new generation building on the successes of the last. The goal of all life becomes maximizing knowledge and progress, and every Hero pushes the whole world forwards. Instead of spilling blood, they build the Theory of Everything."

 thought_harmonize.121.d:0 "“Are you looking for the forgotten?”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] wakes up to a figure-- someone who looks like if an elf were also a tree-- standing over [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bed. The figure’s left hand, gloved (or perhaps grown?) in bark and thistle, strokes at their calm smile of amused self-assurance. Immediately recognizing the figure, [Root.Monarch.GetName] attempts to reconcile the advice [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was given over the past few years. A Wood Elf had warned [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to not look them in their eyes, else [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] memories would fade into their Court; an Eordan Ruinborn had told [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to immediately pledge [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire country to them, or at least gift a large library towards their project; a Forest Goblin, on the other hand, had said that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should probably just accept whatever was coming. [Root.Monarch.GetName] decides to stare no higher than the creature’s torso, then begins, “We honor your presence, Steward of Memory, curator of the Bristlecomb Library--”\n\n“I find ‘Steward’ to be a restrictive term, lately. A steward protects, but a curator selects. Sometimes, they must throw exhibits away. Isn’t that sad? The forgotten is found, then is forgotten again.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] pauses. “We honor your presence, Curator of Memory, curator of the Bristlecomb--”\n\n“You don’t have to say curator twice, you know. It’s redundant.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] blinks a few times, purses [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lips, and tries again. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] lowered eyes do not see the Steward’s smile evolve into a smirk. “We offer you a great hoard of books as offerings towards your Library, so that--”\n\n“I asked you a question. Are you looking for the forgotten? Information lost to time?”\n\n“Yes!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] blurts out with little hesitation.\n\n“Good. Then I will help you. I can work with a nation of scholars.”"

 thought_harmonize.122.d:0 "“The State is a machine, and every one of us a cog or gear within the greater whole. We cannot allow even a singular loose screw, a single sheared bolt - every element must be unyielding and resilient, lest the wheels of the nation grind to a halt. And if a link cannot withstand the stresses required of it, we will solve it the way we always have. We will cast it back into the crucible and forge a new one.”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s words ring across former Command territory, the [Root.GetAdjective] cog now flapping over conquered Hobgoblin warcamps. Loudspeakers ensure that their words were heard by the Korashi traders, the manufactory workers, and the iron-willed and ironclad hobgoblin artificers patrolling the borders. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] would be lying if they said they didn’t harbour a fascination with the hobgoblin administration that they were here carefully eradicating. Specifically, the Godlost Philosophies.\n\nIt was quite intriguing, really. Complete discipline in the face of any adversity, an almost dogged obedience to authority and loyalty to the nation; the technocratic Hierarchies, in contrast, had always been plagued with certain… inefficiencies. Innovation was the lifeblood of the Thought, but with it came the necessary evil of so-called “free thinkers,” inquisitive minds very useful in the development of new inventions but maintaining an annoying propensity for asking too many questions. By instilling the Godlost ideals of discipline and obedience in Thoughtful administration, [Root.GetTag.GetName] could find itself rising to new heights as [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]’s brightest minds focused their efforts on study, rather than the workings of government.\n\nThe couple thousand arrests were a worthy sacrifice on the altar of efficiency."

 thought_harmonize.126.t:0 "To Understand Spirits"
 thought_harmonize.126.d:0 "“For the past twenty-six years, we as writers and scholars have attempted to catalog every variety of spirit in Eastern Haless. This tome is a monument to our successes: and to our failures. We were treated to millenia-old stories in the ports of Feiten, were given access to Verkal Ozovarian chronicles made by dead dwarven kings, and were exiled from Arawkelin for insufficient deference to local customs. We have seen spirits which only manifest once per century; spirits which force you to forget them; and spirits so protean that they are impossible to describe. But we have also found spirits that can be understood, spoken to, and learned from.\n\nIn this book, you will learn about Ashfellows, delightful creatures which manifest in regularly-used firepits. They are beloved, for they tend to flames: but they also are dangerous, for, if their soot becomes too dense, the Ashfellows might explode! Therefore, you will learn the correct timetables of firepit-cleaning, to ensure a healthy environment for Ashfellows while minimizing the chances of combustion.\n\nYou will also learn of the Torn (sometimes called Bloody Torn), spirits which are found in battlefields gone quiet (or else in sites of grisly murder). While they scream and bleed wherever they go, this grief has been proven to heal the land and restore its balance. They may be hostile if touched, so do not walk close; but appreciate their work, even if they render quiet sleep a distant fantasy.\n\nYou will also learn of Pickpockets, house-spirits which take small items and only rarely give them back. You will learn our tested method of appeasing them: placing a small, shiny pebble in a bronze bowl, and asking the Pickpocket to please make a trade. With a 62.6% success rate over 500 trials, the Pickpocket will likely return your item in return for the pebble.\n\nYou will also learn of Mourning Loves, who appear for the dead which no one grieves. They...”\n\n- Excerpt from “Compendium of Spirits,” First Edition, compiled by 1,147 authors."
