Its rim, known as the Cliffs of Ruin, can only be climbed through perilous natural paths, or with the help of pulley systems the construction of which requires days to make. Neither of these solutions is practical for constant trading or for the passage of armies. By pooling enough resources, we will be able to build a passage that will greatly ease travel from up and down the cliffs, and we will be the sole masters of it."

 redrushes_climb_desc:0 "--------------\nDeep in the Cheshoshmar jungle is a path that has connected to the Mayte tribes of Haraf above for generations. Riddled with snakes, flying beasts and treacherous pitfalls to the point of being considered by the local Ruinborn a test of courage, the "Redrushes Climb," as the path is known, has now been cleared, expanded and worked upon to become much safer."

 spoorland_lift_desc:0 "--------------\nBy the falls of the Passing river, on the border of the Trollsbay woods and the Neratican jungles, is a series of pulley elevators built with the help of prairie pioneers. Created on the site of what was originally a single makeshift structure, the Spoorland Lift is an array of elevators wide and powerful enough to lift two carriages each, bringing them from Spoorland below to the Epednan desert above and vice-versa."

 walkway_of_thorns_desc:0 "--------------\nA far-from-home display of Lencori elegance, the Walkway of Thorns is a kilometers-tall metal platform coasting the Cliffs of Ruin, winding back in the other direction halfway through. Travellers can be delighted at the flowers and flora that have been carefully planted all along the Walkway's length, from Lorentish roses to Marlliander Crimson Lilies, to Aelantiri species such as Grebniesther White Berries and Selphereg Saffrons. Proposals to import Man-Eating Sunflowers from Rezankand have however been rejected after some unfortunate complications."

 arca_noruin_desc:0 "--------------\nStanding majestically on the western side of Venaan's Tears, Arca Noruin is a large castle complex built close - but not directly adjacently - to the Cliffs of Ruin. Its keep, with a hundred floors and several attached towers, links at the summit with the Ynnic Plateau by a drawbridge. On foggy days, it is not possible to see the top, nor to see below from the top; for this picturesque quality, it is also nicknamed \"The Mistpiercer\"."

 arca_venaan_desc:0 "--------------\nArca Venaan, more than a structure, is a love song to the elven race. A spiral tower of the most lucent teal, it has been decorated with floral patterns, waves and clouds on the outside. Its interior is wide enough to allow an open atrium, at the center of which rises a marble pillar with the statues of important elves carved onto its sides. To connect guests and travellers to the Ynnic plateau, a wide, winding staircase hugs the tower's walls, twisting and turning as it rises around the pillar, all the way to the upper floor parallel to the Cliffs of Ruin. On the walls, a diagonal mural accompanies the staircase, depicting episodes of elven history from the War of Broken Chains, to the Ruin of Aelantir, to the landing of Munas to Endrallian's rediscovery of Aelantir in 1500 AA.\n\nWhile scholars are still at work uncovering secrets of elven history and, as they do, they are bound to find inaccuracies with some of the mural's portrayals, none can deny its artistic power: guests often travel the entire length of the tower without realizing, engrossed as they are in following the mural."

 arbeloch_ascensor_desc:0 "--------------\nA long slope has been dug directly into the Cliffs of Ruin to allow a rail platform to travel through. Using hydraulic power harnessed from the nearby river, the platform rises and descends along its kilometers-long path, moving unperturbed like the hand of an giant. While not the most glamorous or extravagant of the cliff passages, the Arbeloch Ascensor is the fastest and safest way to get through, being able to lift heavy cargo or several regiments per trip in a state-of-the-art feat of engineering efficiency."
