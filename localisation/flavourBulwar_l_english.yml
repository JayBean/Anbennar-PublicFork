 bulwar_flavour.1.t:0 "Returning Surani Refugees"
 bulwar_flavour.1.d:0 "The lands that have been occupied by the gnolls for so long are now no longer in their control. This allows for the return of Surani people to the land the fled from so long ago. Groups of them have been spotted trying to return home. This has caused some stir. Should we allow them to return to their lands?"
 bulwar_flavour.1.a:0 "Welcome them back!"
 bulwar_flavour.1.b:0 "It will cause too much of a ruckus."
 bulwar_flavour.2.t:0 "An Offer of Help"
 bulwar_flavour.2.d:0 "An elven warrior has appeared in our court. He calls himself by the name of Camnaril of the Sands. Supposedly he claims to be a Jaddari officer, the son of a veteran of Jaher's conquests. He speaks of a different take our relationship to Surakel. While the Sun Elves would have us believe that only they can fulfil the duties of the deceased god. However Camnaril speaks of how the Jaddari see that all who are faithful can take the burden of Surakel. He proposes a world wherein we are no longer subservient to the sun elves."
 bulwar_flavour.2.a:0 "A Jaddari officer huh? He should stay and tell us more!"
 bulwar_flavour.2.b:0 "Interesting. See him on his way, we have no need of this heretic."
 bulwar_flavour.3.t:0 "A Faith of Tolerance?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.da:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country. They speak of a new religion, one that promotes tolerance of all races. This 'Jadd' they speak of has them organise in their own communes and do work in the name of their sun god. They even have started preaching on the street to anyone who would listen, saying that the darkness in their hearts must be banished and that all are welcome within the light of 'Surael'. More and more are starting to listen to them. Can we really let this continue?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.db:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country, speaking herecy. They claim that Surael has not really entrusted the Sun Elves with his duties and that instead his duties fall to everyone who follows his light. They are encouraging the peasants to take more and more power into their own hands. This is disturbing the public order! Can we really let this continue?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.a:0 "Let them do what they want."
 bulwar_flavour.3.b:0 "Absolutely not! See them off!"
 bulwar_flavour.4.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Minorities Are Welcomed Within the Jadd"
 bulwar_flavour.4.d:0 "The minorities in [Root.GetName] have long lived under less than ideal circumstances. However with convictions of the Jadd comes a new era. Several gifts have been sent and members of those groups have been invited to public gatherings. May the events there set an example to all of us."
 bulwar_flavour.4.a:0 "We welcome the faithful!"
 bulwar_flavour.5.t:0 "Minority Groups in [Root.GetName] Outmaneuvred"
 bulwar_flavour.5.d:0 "While we try to live harmoneously with other races, politics and ambition brings out the worst in people. A political rivalry in [Root.GetName] has spiraled out of control to the point where one sought to use the other's racial heritage against them, starting a slander campaign against all members of his kind. This started locally but it is likely to affect the entire country!"
 bulwar_flavour.5.a:0 "Unfortunate..."
 bulwar_flavour.5.b:0 "We won't let that happen!"
 bulwar_flavour.6.t:0 "A Foreign Commander"
 bulwar_flavour.6.d:0 "We have been approached by an elf in foreign dress. His tanned skin and pale hair go combined with garb that say he is one of the Jaddari, remnants of Jaher's legions that became beduoin warriors and turned towards a strange faith. Shall we take him on as our commander? He might be a great help in our wars."
 bulwar_flavour.6.a:0 "He could be useful, welcome him in."
 bulwar_flavour.6.b:0 "Unnecessary."
 bulwar_flavour.7.t:0 "A Festival of Surael of the Jadd"
 bulwar_flavour.7.d:0 "It is time, my lord, the weather is perfect, the water is clear, the sun is bright. A festival in the honour of our glorious god will be held. The people will dance in the street and sacrifices of bread and water will be offered up to his Radiance. All will work towards the great execution of this feast. How shall we deliver our contribution?"
 bulwar_flavour.7.a:0 "Let the glory of Surael of the Jadd be known!"
 bulwar_flavour.7.b:0 "We will organise our share."
 bulwar_flavour.7.c:0 "The people know what to do."
 bulwar_flavour.8.t:0 "Divine Inspiration"
 bulwar_flavour.8.d:0 "A preacher in [Root.Capital.GetName] has been drawing great crowds with his speeches. [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally also attended one of his ralleys and found [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] greatly inspired. It is clear, Surael is behind fully and we strike with his favour!"
 bulwar_flavour.8.a:0 "May Surael blind our enemies!"
 bulwar_flavour.9.t:0 "Violence against Religious Minorities in [Root.GetName]"
 bulwar_flavour.9.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetName] have been misguided in their faith. A group of angry zealots have taken it upon themselves to start several attacks on the local population to punish them for the darkness in their hearts. There are reports of torture, lynching and destruction of property. The violence seems to be getting even further out of hand. What do we do?"
 bulwar_flavour.9.a:0 "Let the faithless burn!"
 bulwar_flavour.9.b:0 "Stop this chaos immediately!"
 bulwar_flavour.10.t:0 "The People of [Root.GetName] See the Light!"
 bulwar_flavour.10.d:0 "The knowledge that their people will be accepted in the country does favours for their acceptance of the government. The people in [Root.GetName] have seen the treatment of their bretheren within the Jadd and accepted Surael's light. They are visiting local temples and starting to learn their daily prayers and traditions. They are well on their way to becoming good propagators of the pricinciples of the Jadd."
 bulwar_flavour.10.a:0 "Welcome to the arms of truth!"
 bulwar_flavour.11.t:0 "The People of [Root.GetName] embrace the Jadd"
 bulwar_flavour.11.d:0 "The Jadd missionaries have managed to sway the locals in [Root.GetName] to their religion. Already new local communties are forming around the organisation of the Jadd faith. Among them are pockets of zealous warriors only all to eager to serve their faith in whatever way their leaders ask of them. If we allow this to go on they might create great instability in the country!"
 bulwar_flavour.11.a:0 "That's not what I wanted! Kick them out!"
 bulwar_flavour.11.b:0 "This was to be expected"
 bulwar_flavour.11.c:0 "They're really onto something!"
 bulwar_flavour.12.t:0 "The People's Faith"
 bulwar_flavour.12.d:0 "It was a fateful decision to let that group of Jadd missionaries into our borders and to preach their faith. The people in our land now seem to all adhere to this new faith. Tell me, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], have the people truly seen the light and should we follow in their conversion, or are harsher measures necessary?"
 bulwar_flavour.12.a:0 "Let us embrace the Light of the Jadd"
 bulwar_flavour.12.b:0 "Let the people believe what they want"
 bulwar_flavour.12.c:0 "We must destroy this horror! Get it out of my lands!"

 bulwar_flavour.13.d:0 "Recently, Cannorian traders in the city of Brasan have been bringing in thought-provoking art and scholarly works. This has gone on for so long that these new ideas have now spread to our own people too, and even to our administrators within the city."

Some barges are now able to transit the city, leading to an increase in trade. However, the constant loading and unloading to portage around the direlect locks and lifts limits how much trade the canals can reasonably support."

However, one corpse got their attentionf for it bears the signet ring of an old adventurer of some reknown, the young Sun Elf charlatan, Evoris the Splendid. His sudden disappearance became a song which is still sung in taverns to this day. Everyone assumed he was kidnapped by harpies, but his corpse suggests he was merely drunk and fell in the mud."

But we've not extinguished our foes yet. There is another who threatens our rule over the eastern Salahad. The Jaddari claim to be the remants of the Phoenix Empire's most elite soldiers, but what they fail to understand is that the Phoenix Empire is dead. Jaher threw our ancestors back from Bulwar, but we are still here, while he is gone and his successors are weak, this Jaddar is no different. We're still on a high from our last victory. Let us use that momentum to fight the desert elves and Zokka will slay Jaddar himself. The ghost of the Phoenix Legions is only a mirage."

Many surrendered to this new overlord who destroyed the one that unified them. While many fled, Elven troops moved in with little to no resistance. Along the Suran, the oppressed human population of Hasr have declared their freedom and sought protection under their liberators."
