 red_dragon_1:0 "Red Dragon: The Dragonhoard"
 desc_red_dragon_1:0 "Every kobold knows the tale of the mighty Red Dragon, whose avarice and greed created the biggest dragonhoard ever known. His spirit watches over us all, and his avarice is reflected in us. Contributing to our own hoards is for the followers of the Red Dragon more than duty – it is our mission to see them grow until our gods wake once more.\n\nGain extra §GChurch Power§! for hoard donations."
 red_dragon_2:0 "Red Dragon: Dragon's Peace"
 desc_red_dragon_2:0 "The rule of Nimrith the Red in Khugdihr lasted uncontested for over 600 years, and under him a secret society known as the Cult of Nimrithan rose in the shadows. The cult had followers of all religions and races, unified in peace and servitude to growing Nimrith hoard so his endless lust for gold could be sated.  The lesson is thus – under a mighty ruler, one can hoard in peace."
 red_dragon_3:0 "Red Dragon: Nimrith's Law"
 desc_red_dragon_3:0 "Under Nimrith's rule, the Nimrithan were expected to contribute all their worldly possessions to the hoard. In overshadowing the temptation of their lesser greed with his grand avarice, Nimrith made the Nimrithan develop a strong sense of community – there was no room for misuse of wealth. This teaching has been codified as Nimrith's Law, and the followers of the Red Dragon now talk about wealth redistribution and the common good."
 
 blue_dragon_1:0 "Blue Dragon: Progenitor"
 desc_blue_dragon_1:0 "Long ago the great Blue Dragon showed us our way out of the Dragondepths and allowed us to live a life unlike any we had before. His strong leadership allowed us to make a home for ourselves in the Dragon coast and is the example taken by all that seek to serve the clan as a whole.\n\nGain §GChurch Power§! for recruit generals and admirals."
 blue_dragon_2:0 "Blue Dragon: Tayekan's Lessons"
 desc_blue_dragon_2:0 "As our understanding of Tayekan the Blue deepens, we find that there might have been lessons we have missed until now. Tayekan did not always choose violence, but also knew when to appease others. Tayekan's Lessons are now followed by the followers of the Blue Dragon, demanding them to consider their options before resorting to crude force."
 blue_dragon_3:0 "Blue Dragon: The Observer"
 desc_blue_dragon_3:0 "Tayekan the Blue is a secretive god, who likes to lurk behind the scenes rather than act openly. We have heard rumours and anecdotal evidence suggesting that he may still be among us, hiding in plain sight. This realisation has revolutionised the cult of the Blue Dragon with a shift towards the secretive and clandestine. "
 
 green_dragon_1:0 "Green Dragon: Sea Guardian"
 desc_green_dragon_1:0 "Old greenscale legends tell about the mighty Green Dragon of the waves, who protects her children from the cruel seas and guides them on their journeys. Her protection is thus often sought by sailors and kobolds of the sea.\n\nGain §GChurch Power§! for exploring provinces with an explorer or conquistador."
 green_dragon_2:0 "Green Dragon: The Matron"
 desc_green_dragon_2:0 "Not much is known about the Iothoral, yet it is certain that her cult views her as a draconic matron; an absent mother compared to Tayekan's fathership. Kobold sailors search and claim distant lands in search of her, many without any intention of returning. Rumours tell of a mighty green dragon in the far west…"
 green_dragon_3:0 "Green Dragon: Iothoral The Lost"
 desc_green_dragon_3:0 "After searching Iothoral was found, but not in the place ancient legend would have you believe. We have heard tales of Iothoral the Green's slumber in the mighty Deepwoods, far from our craggy coasts. This has caused a theological uproar in the cult of the Green Dragon, with connections drawn between older myths and traditions and newer evidence – for example, ships of mighty, holy, wood."
 
 black_dragon_1:0 "Black Dragon: Overwhelming Force"
 desc_black_dragon_1:0 "The mighty Black Dragon is only followed by the harshest and cruellest of kobolds, admiring domination and subjugation of the weak. Although not a stance shared by many, it is nonetheless respected as a return to tradition – our origins lay here\n\nGain §GChurch Power§! for conquering provinces."
 black_dragon_2:0 "Black Dragon: Primacy of Might"
 desc_black_dragon_2:0 "One thing holds true in any age: might is the only thing that matters. What use are petty justifications when there is no might to back them up? The cult of the Black Dragon has reformed from a fringe cult to an institution of its own – an institution dedicated to emulating Zaamalot the Black and ensuring our rule via force."
 black_dragon_3:0 "Black Dragon: Zaamalot's Reign"
 desc_black_dragon_3:0 "Zaamalot the Black is a feared name throughout the world, a clear symbol of the superiority of dragons. Our historical findings from Zaamalot's reign have inspired the cult of the Black Dragon – they now proclaim that kobolds have the divine right to rule the entire world, as children of the dragons."
 
 white_dragon_1:0 "White Dragon: Cold Death"
 desc_white_dragon_1:0 "The clever White Dragon hunts not her prey directly, but lets it tire itself out in a bitter cold until it is time to strike. A popular deity with hunters and fishers, her guidance may come to serve the patient kobold well.\n\nGain §GChurch Power§! for successfully besieging and constructing forts."
 white_dragon_2:0 "White Dragon: Permafrost"
 desc_white_dragon_2:0 "The cult of the White Dragon has organised and spread their teachings to many soldiers, installing into them a patience reminiscent of Elkaesal the White's own. While no major demographic change has followed, many of their teachings mesh well with our natural tendency to prefer holding our enemies fast and striking suddenly when conditions are favourable."
 white_dragon_3:0 "White Dragon: Elkaesal the Inevitable"
 desc_white_dragon_3:0 "In the frozen lands to the north a prophecy is sung by the skald-priests, foretelling certain doom should Elkaesal the White wake. As long as their flame burns, the world is safe from her frost. Of course, we know that this is just another reflection of her infinite patience – she is inevitable. This teaching has resonated deeply within the cult of the White Dragon."
 
 purple_dragon_1:0 "Purple Dragon: Subterranean Guardian"
 desc_purple_dragon_1:0 "Despite our ventures on the surface, our origins lay underground. The guardian deity favoured by many subterranean dwellers is the Purple Dragon, who inspires us to work harder for a good life. Her followers lead example by never slacking when there is work to be done.\n\nGain §GChurch Power§! for constructing buildings."
 purple_dragon_2:0 "Purple Dragon: Improvise, Adapt, Overcome"
 desc_purple_dragon_2:0 "Life underground has always been harsh, with many dangers. However, we have always thrived, in part due to our natural ingenuity. The cult following the Hunter of the Deep has recently been stressing this – ingenuity is industriousness, and thus a virtue."
 purple_dragon_3:0 "Purple Dragon: Hunter of the Deep"
 desc_purple_dragon_3:0 "The Purple Dragon is proving elusive, with little history to find. Unfortunately, what we have found is painting a somewhat different picture of her than the myths we know. This has led to a shift in the cult of the Purple Dragon, the Hunter of the Deep, with her as less of a matronly leader and more of a harsh taskmistress. This religiously motivated discipline is very effective, however."
 
 brown_dragon_1:0 "Brown Dragon: Unbridled Fury"
 desc_brown_dragon_1:0 "The cult of the Brown Dragon is one of the smaller cults, with a disorganised following. This does not mean that a follower of the Brown Dragon is to be trifled with – indeed, quite the opposite, as few things can stand between the primal fury of someone who follows the tenets of wilderness.\n\nGain §GChurch Power§! for winning battles."
 brown_dragon_2:0 "Brown Dragon: Small but Mighty"
 desc_brown_dragon_2:0 "While there still is no grand following of the Sand Demon of the Salahd, philosophers and other thinkers have started to apply some of their philosophy to other problems in our society. A few prominent examples are an increase in debate culture, striking, and a general assertiveness. The other races best make way!"
 brown_dragon_3:0 "Brown Dragon: Force of Nature"
 desc_brown_dragon_3:0 "The followers of the Sand Demon Cult have gained much notoriety among the worshippers of the dragon cult. They are infamous for being forces of nature. TODO"
 
 brass_dragon_1:0 "Brass Dragon: Protector of the Weak"
 desc_brass_dragon_1:0 "The cult of the Brass Dragon holds morals dear, and has a large following among the bravest warriors. One important point in his cult is to support those weaker than you, lest they be harmed. A leader following the Brass Dragon would enjoy a becalmed populace, as they know they are protected.\n\nGain §GChurch Power§! for converting provinces religion."
 brass_dragon_2:0 "Brass Dragon: Jyntas the Liberator"
 desc_brass_dragon_2:0 "With the growing influence of the cult of the Brass Dragon, certain stories have recently had an upswing in our society. One story tells of how Jyntas the Brass for no gain of his own saved a people because he saw it was right. This has no doubt inspired all our warriors; to know that there can be a greater cause."
 brass_dragon_3:0 "Brass Dragon: Champion of Justice"
 desc_brass_dragon_3:0 "Our search for evidence has recently borne fruit, and the cult of the Brass Dragon seems to be truthful. Jyntas was a wandering warrior, travelling the world and combating injustice where he saw it. One accredited source from the east tells of a mysterious martial hero named Jyntas, saving a people from slavery under malevolent lords. This has made our populace proud, and optimism is prevailing."
 
 copper_dragon_1:0 "Copper Dragon: The Free Spirit"
 desc_copper_dragon_1:0 "The followers of the Copper Dragon are a flighty sort, tending to move around our realm at will. Their loose cult teaches independence, but also to travel with purpose; often this purpose is to get perspective on the world. Among the warriors, the Copper Dragon is not a favourite, but perhaps there are more things in life than war?\n\nGain §GChurch Power§! for developing provninces."
 copper_dragon_2:0 "Copper Dragon: Alos' Peace"
 desc_copper_dragon_2:0 "The cult of the Copper Dragon has organised, resulting in learned scholars and merchants freely wandering about and offering Alos' Peace. There are some that have made ventures into other realms, to some success. The evidence pointing towards Alos the Copper being a relatively peaceful and sociable dragon has only exacerbated this."
 copper_dragon_3:0 "Copper Dragon: The Prankster God"
 desc_copper_dragon_3:0 "In direct refutation of prevailing theories, our scholars maintain that Alos the Copper is alive and about, living a peaceful, albeit mischievous, life. Armed with their religious texts, and a good dose of optimism, the followers of Alos have gone out into the world and spread tales of a god, long thought dead, living among us, and some of their teachings have even found favour with non-Kobold populations."
 
 bronze_dragon_1:0 "Bronze Dragon: The Conqueror"
 desc_bronze_dragon_1:0 "The teachings of the Bronze Dragon puts a strong emphasis on warrior culture, and has become the major cult for our warriors with the decline of swarm tactics over the years. As one of the younger cults its tenets are often in flux, but with myths which primarily revolve around conquest and war there is a clear direction forward.\n\nGain §GChurch Power§! for winning wars."
 bronze_dragon_2:0 "Bronze Dragon: Roar of War"
 desc_bronze_dragon_2:0 "After a gradual increase in influence, the cult of Aakhet has branched out into not only warfare but also war materiel. With inspiration from a dragon's mighty roar, one innovation of note is so-called roaring cannons, which both have an intimidation factor, religious significance, and better effect.  "
 bronze_dragon_3:0 "Bronze Dragon: Aakhet's Example"
 desc_bronze_dragon_3:0 "The great Aakhet the Bronze was a mighty conqueror, famed for conquering all of Kheterata and much of Bulwar. This discipline is something that has been preached by the cult of the Bronze Dragon, leading to clear chains of command and unbreaking lines of soldiers, especially those who follow Aakhet the Bronze."
 
 silver_dragon_1:0 "Silver Dragon: Overseer of Justice"
 desc_silver_dragon_1:0 "The cult of the Silver Dragon are represented greatly in the vicinity of the ruler, as their tenets include lawfulness and justice. This has led them to naturally seek administrator roles. The myth of the Silver Dragon tells of a just and proud guardian protecting the lawful – a good deity for a just ruler."
 silver_dragon_2:0 "Silver Dragon: King of Dragons"
 desc_silver_dragon_2:0 "The cult of the Silver Dragon has organised their tenets around the divine right of the ruler to rule, with the Silver Dragon as the King of Dragons. These new tenets were in part inspired by tales of an ancient human empire with the Silver Dragon as patron. Outside of our territory, the reception to the Silver Dragon is generally positive, and inside, our new institutions allow us to rule better than ever before."
 silver_dragon_3:0 "Silver Dragon: Avatar of Castellos"
 desc_silver_dragon_3:0 "A grand revelation has been made – the other races worship the Silver Dragon too! His name is Castellos the Silver, and he is the king of their gods. This has greatly swayed the public opinion of the other races; we will gladly extend the spirit of community to these dragon-worshippers!"
 
 gold_dragon_1:0 "Gold Dragon: Golden Prosperity"
 desc_gold_dragon_1:0 "The myths of the Gold Dragon tells of a wise and benevolent protector, letting his chosen lands prosper while letting his wise subjects rule in his stead. His followers tell us that this is the path to enlightenment, whatever that means.\n\nGain §G+15%§! Church Power for each vassal or march."
 gold_dragon_2:0 "Gold Dragon: Balris' Teachings"
 desc_gold_dragon_2:0 "The strengthened cult of the Gold Dragon has started preaching a set of teachings called Balris' Teachings, first of which is something called the Golden rule. It states: “Live a virtuous life, and stay in balance with yourself and with others. In this, you may expect the same in return”. This is taken to mean that if a ruler acts well, then subjects will follow their example."
 gold_dragon_3:0 "Gold Dragon: Wisdom in Humility"
 desc_gold_dragon_3:0 "A new interpretation of the wisdom of Balris is that there is wisdom in humility; to let your ego stand in the way of progress is a great sin. In particular, the ruler's advisors are adamant that there is something to gain here…"
