  spiderwretch_teaching_our_ways_desc:0 "Expanding our workshop-embassies in Qirnualaroq and Jögghlumo has made them more open about their secrets. Our workers are not only just working, but also providing us with valuable information from the inside. To continue our show of goodwill, we shall indulge them with more goods and techniques of production."

  spiderwretch_valley_of_ogres_desc:0 "As our scouts previously reported, there are some ogrish, some kind of troll, nations close to our spiderdens-entrance. They seem dumb, but have valuable skills and power. Those could be useful to us."

  spiderwretch_large_man_power_title:0 "Large-Man-Power"
  spiderwretch_large_man_power_desc:0 "With our ogrish companions now in our fold, we can start to discuss a common problem. The centaurs, the wild nomadic horse-man people of the lightlands. The ogres have been fighting them for longer than us. With our armies properly established, we can learn some things from them. In return we can teach them some strategies of our own."

  spiderwretch_smalls_among_bigs_desc:0 "Our cooperation in war and production has been a delight to us all, mostly us, but they do not know that. They are not very good at keeping secrets it seems, but we are generous, we will expand our production cooperation."

  spiderwretch_geniuses_in_brutality_title:0 "Geniuses in Brutality"
  spiderwretch_geniuses_in_brutality_desc:0 "The ogre valley used to be splintered. Internal conflicts clogging their unity. Now that is no longer the case. In their unison, and in our technological advances, we have found a new type of warfare. The bigger the cannon the bigger the boom, yes, but if the big cannon is caught we lose the boom. Ogres have massive mammoths and can even carry cannons of their own. Why can't we?"

  spiderwretch_silken_cities_title:0 "Silken Cities"
  spiderwretch_silken_cities_desc:0 "Since our alchemists succeeded in the creation of a hardened silk, we can now pursue an old dream of ours.

  spiderwretch_the_lands_of_light_desc:0 "As we migrated to the cave-delta of the eastern reach, we discovered the outside. A large flat landscape with blinding light coming from a blue roof. Our tribal leaders seemed keen to stay in that cave-delta, as it was ripe with small caves and crevices to live and farm in. While we settle, we must explore the potential of the lightlands. Send out 3 groups of spiderscouts, one in each direction."

  spiderwretch_unify_the_crawlers_desc:0 "Our clan might have settled, and built out our existence, but our fellow crawlers still live scattered and primitively in the rest  of the spiderdens. With our clan strong and evolving, we shall integrate all crawlers under our banner."

  spiderwretch_a_taste_for_blood_desc:0 "Through luck, but mostly the hard skill of our spiderriders, we have bested the four-legged enemy multiple times. We not only have the ambition, but clearly also the capacity to control the lightlands. Although we have paid in blood, we have become smarter in the way of the plains."

  spiderwretch_blood_revealed_opportunity_title:0 "Blood-revealed Opportunity"
  spiderwretch_blood_revealed_opportunity_desc:0 "Now that our initial goals under our control, we realize that we can do much more. Till now we have used the river to contact the lake-humans, but with our spiders we should have a direct border instead. Not only that, that same river goes just as far the other direction, what spoils hide down there?"

  spiderwretch_masters_of_silk_and_venom_desc:0 "Using the new breeding facility, we have improved our silk-making substantially. Our capital is flourishing, and therefore we shall establish a central silkguild, responsible for the oversight of all of our other silkproducers."

  spiderwretch_unhindered_growth_title:0 "Unhindered Growth"
  spiderwretch_unhindered_growth_desc:0 "Our market and our ambitions have grown larger, the facility of Weballey is no longer large enough. Since we now control the open vast lightlands, we should exploit that advantage. Moving our facility to a new and larger location will un-cap our ambitions. Better, larger and faster spiders will be bred forth and tamed for pets, mounts and silk."

  spiderwretch_a_life_in_suspension_title:0 "A Life in Suspension"
  spiderwretch_a_life_in_suspension_desc:0 "New spiders out of the facility have brought forth new ideas and needs. Their silk is seemingly harder than other silk. This sparks an idea. Silk that is usable in armor, housing and much more. The more powerful goblins of Pauzhrad demand higher living standards aswell. Proceed with experimenting."

  spiderwretch_silken_infrastructure_title:0 "Silken Infrastructure"
  spiderwretch_silken_infrastructure_desc:0 "With our new hardened silk used widely, we have realized the potential of this research. While we may control the lightlands, and our spiders themselves having no problem traversing them, wagons and goblins on foot struggle. The ground is dusty, dry and it's hard to navigate. If we can make silk into hard armour, could we make it into a central road system?"

  spiderwretch_the_silk_road_title:0 "The Silk Road"

  spiderwretch_unsightly_facility_desc:0 "As trade and wealth flows in and out of our Pauzhrad and the growing city just outside it, the massive breeding facility has become a sore sight. Some foreign traders do not appreciate the to-them-scary variations of spiders in there. Trading is one of our primary economic goals, so let's oblige them, it needed to be renewed anyway. Let us build one just outside the flows of traders, but not too far away for our government to supervise."

  spiderwretch_potential_in_every_crevice_desc:0 "The cavedelta of the eastern reach was indeed very ripe with hundreds if not thousands of smaller caves and crevices to explore and develop. After our adventurers fully cleared them all, we realized we got blessed. The proximity to the lightlands combined with the moist caves has brought forth exceptionally good conditions to grow cavegoods."

  spiderwretch_the_silk_hold_title:0 "The Silk Hold"
  spiderwretch_the_silk_hold_desc:0 "The crawlers are finally united under one banner. Our capital is rapidly developing, yet its name is lacking. Inspired by our old oppressors, although they failed to completely do that, we shall name the same way. This will also signal to our people that we are now our own rulers."

  spiderwretch_centralized_breeding_title:0 "Centralized Breeding"
  spiderwretch_centralized_breeding_desc:0 "With a central government controlling the matters of the spiderdens, we now have clear overview. Till now, all of our spiders have been tamed and partially bred differently per group of crawlers. By organizing and centralizing the research into spiders and their potential, we can elevate theirs and our potential several times. Establish a facility near our capital, there we shall create the future."

  spiderwretch_caravan_spiders_title:0 "Caravan Spiders"
  spiderwretch_caravan_spiders_desc:0 "The increased size of our facility paid off. Breeding spiders is a fast process, as their lifecycles are very short. This allowed our breeders to bring forth an ungodly large spider. Some chemicals might have been added too. A spider so large, a small town could live on its back. It is quite slow, unfortunately, so our generals were left dissappointed. Our kartel leaders and shamans looked at it with power in their eyes. They saw the potential. This could usher in a new era of trade."

  spiderwretch_cross_roads_title:0 "Cross Roads"
  spiderwretch_cross_roads_desc:0 "The trade flows across the large plains effortlessly. With our caravans going out, new trading hubs have emerged, especially at the meeting point between the bulwari road and the Lake Federation roads. Furthermore, the bulwari trademarket has even larger potential than the lakes. This could easily be accommodated with some further investements."

  spiderwretch_securing_the_lightlands_title:0 "Securing the Lightlands"
  spiderwretch_securing_the_lightlands_desc:0 "We did it. We cast the large lands of light under our banner. No one on this side of the mountains can compare. We did what the centaurs failed to do, despite their clear advantage in knowledge of the plains. Of course we will utilize that knowledge ruthlessly to our own advantage. We might have won, but not learning from our friends and especially foes is fatal to any future."

  spiderwretch_brewing_venom_desc:0 "They say venombrew is the strongest drink in all the lands. Till now it was mostly produced in few amounts. We can now establish a proper brewery and distribute venombrew, mostly to our shamans of course. Average goblins would not know what to do with the expanded conscience."

  spiderwretch_rumours_of_a_mother_title:0 "Rumours of a Mother"
  spiderwretch_rumours_of_a_mother_desc:0 "In the area our ancestors have called Yidab's Nest, our explorers recently discovered a new branch of caves, seemingly not inhabiting anything anymore. Organize a scouting party to clear and explore these caves. They could hold unimaginable loot or goods."

  spiderwretch_organizing_religious_structure_title:0 "Religious Structure"
  spiderwretch_organizing_religious_structure_desc:0 "The new worship of Muta Kroozpauz is spreading rapidly, different interpretations can cause trouble. Our shamans will establish a relatively unified view of Muta Kroozpauz. This will also help in our efforts to become more civilized to the outside world."

  spiderwretch_spider_theocracy_title:0 "Spider Theocracy"
  spiderwretch_spider_theocracy_desc:0 "Our nation is equal to the rest of the world, our beliefs unified and our nation reformed, we can emphasize our advantages. We should establish a more centralized culture revolving around our goddess Muta Kroozpauz. Our shamans will be the leading authority on most matters including trade, faith and production."

  spiderwretch_expanding_our_religion_title:0 "Expanding our Religion"
  spiderwretch_expanding_our_religion_desc:0 "With the belief in Muta Kroozpauz spreading across the lightlands, our desire to adapt to the world increases. Large distances can cause differences and rifts over time. To combat this let's expand our religious system, and even include the natives' gods. Of course, they are lesser versions and not worth worshipping. This will empower the status of our Muta Kroozpauz."

  spiderwretch_order_of_the_spider_title:0 "Order of the Spider"
  spiderwretch_order_of_the_spider_desc:0 "Massive spiders, wealth flowing and the dominant nation on the continent, this can only mean one thing. We are the chosen of Muta Kroozpauz. We are her will on Halann and as such we dedicate ourselves to it. The Caravan spider shall be her representative in our trading order. We will establish traderoutes for our caravan spider to traverse and sell wares to."

  spiderwretch_kroozpauz_realm_title:0 "Kroozpauz' Realm"
  spiderwretch_kroozpauz_realm_desc:0 "We have spread the realm of Muta Kroozpauz across the world. Silk, venombrew and much else is being praised and valued everywhere. We have truly succeeded. We must never forget our roots, the small insignificant clan in the caves of the back-then dark spiderdens, because that will keep us smart. Let us set up a central place of worship in the location we first discovered the truth. This temple shall serve to unite our people across the nation."

  flavour_spiderwretch_riverpath_human_spider_exchange.d:0 "Ever since we came into contact with the human nations that lie next to the big lakes of the plains, there has been an active effort made from both sides to make our ties, both defensive and commercial, strong and healthy. A steady influx of human citizens arrive at our trade posts and cities in the planes, with some even coming into the Reach! Of course, the opposite is also true, with goblin traders and thinkers making way for the cities under the promise of riches, both material and philosophical. As our alliance grows stronger, so do we, and it is clearer by the day that it will last a long, long time."

We wonder how the rest of the lakes think of us. Our tradepartners are still on good terms with us, but they seem unsure as well. There are significant cultural differences between the south and north. Not all of Lake Fedederation will look kindly in our direction."

Our people are brought together by this feeling, but while the ogres feel the more literal version of the word, our hunger is more esoteric in nature. Be it hunger for riches or knowledge, we move to soothe this ache as best we can, and the Alliance with the ogre kingdoms of the north has very much helped sate the hunger. The trading network established between Magharma and the Reach has had the effect of causing the movement of large masses of ogres, moving south to our cities seeking fulfillment. As for us, we have extracted great knowledge of our new allies, both on warfare and on survival on the rough terrain of the mountainside. Soon enough, a big ogre population will have arrived at our gates, and we will be able to offer them the fill of their lives, on the condition that they help us wage warfare against the enemy they hate so much…"

The cannon would be far more mobile than the stationairy (although larger) cannons that are normally used. Since we have bred forth huge and strong spiders, we could easily adopt some of that idea. Just load it with armor and a large cannon capable of firing our madnessbombs. That will surely ripen the enemy frontline right before the charge."

Both parties were initially confused or scared, but the so-called ogres were not hostile. The ogres were lumberjacks, not warriors. They led our scouts further in, where they exchanged a few formalities with the local chief. This has great potential."

Upper body of a hairless dwarf, and lower body of a horse. They destroyed our scouts and left them for dead. The few goblins who survived by playing dead, struggled back towards our caves, travelling mostly at night and hiding during the day. The few survivors even split up in two, as hiding on flat plains was a hard task. It seems the other splinter did not make it.

Apart from a source of water, it meant they were bound to find life much more commonly than in their previous march. After following this river away from the southern regions of the plains, they eventually found themselves at the shore of the biggest mass of water they had ever seen. The biggest mass of water any of their ancestors had ever seen, perhaps. An almost endless sight of blue, only interrupted by floating husks on the lake, and what seemed like a pretty big city far in the horizon. \nSoon enough, they had found a passage through the water. A small piece of land that separated the gargantuan mass into two, still massive formations. Not before long the scouts found themselves at the gates of a city, and a regiment of what looked like taller dwarves came down from the walls to meet them. After a long conversation with the guard, and an even longer one with the “mayor” of the city, an agreement was made between the nations to open communications and trade. This exchange was celebrated at home, since it meant that, at long last, our clan had an ally against the overwhelming strength of the centaurs."

Our spiders silk and webs are able to be manipulated with various methods and chemicals, and therefore able to create any desired effect we desire. The only obstacle is the method."

  flavour_spiderwretch_hardening_silk_venom.d:0 "Tinking pure venom on top of the silk, and stirring it around properly might do the trick. This could potentially combine and harden the silk. Although it sounded theoretically good, reality was far from it. After making the first piece of armor and having a soldier try it on, we quickly found a problem. Despite our affinity with venom, this venom still proved fatal. Our poor soldier did not make it. Seems excellent for some traps if we should so desire. "

Tamers and alchemists will work together on this case. Tamers will be responsible for finding the right spiders, while the chemists apply the right method. Ofcourse the shamans will overlook the process, as expanding Muta Kroozpauz' realm across the entire lightlands is a noble cause."
