 tluukt_jixobix_dig_title:0 "The Jixobix Dig"
 tluukt_jixobix_dig_desc:0 "The steep cliffs of Jixobix have long captivated gnollkind with the tantalizing wealth buried within. Reclaimed from the region's human inhabitants in the 9th century by Jix the Goldseeker, it was the wealth of gold interred within those cliffs that fueled the expansion of gnollkind across the Šad Sur and beyond.\n\nYet, in the intervening centuries since the fall of Jix's Pack the fracturing of our tribes has resulted in the mines falling into disrepair. This can stand no longer - we shall prise once again from the Šad Sur that which it has for too long kept from us!"

 tluukt_slave_miners_title:0 "Slave Miners"
 tluukt_slave_miners_desc:0 "The mines first carved by Jix are insufficient for our pack's needs, and we must delve deeper into the cliffs. Gnolls, however, are ill-suited to such labor, and we have thus far made extensive use of slaves seized from our Bulwari conquests.\n\nYet the Šad Sur jealously guards its treasures, making a mockery of the weak who fall prey to its dangers - and these slaves are weak indeed, dying by the droves each day. If we are to continue our exploitation of the mountain, we must first ensure a more steady supply of manpower!"

 tluukt_stolen_guns_title:0 "Stolen Guns"
 tluukt_stolen_guns_desc:0 "While our pitiful predecessors bickered incessantly in the Šad Sur, the world proceeded without us. In the time since the last great gnollish conquests, war has changed. Armies tote alongside them massive tubes of iron and bronze from which they launch death at the fortresses that seek to impede their warpath.\n\nOur ignorance of these devious weapons shall persist no longer - the pirates of Drolakand have traversed the wide corners of the Divenhal, and from them we shall secure the secrets of gunpowder, and make of it proper gnollish cannons!"

 tluukt_manipulate_cult_title:0 "Manipulate the Cult"
 tluukt_manipulate_cult_desc:0 "The temples of Eduz-Vacyn are but one of many centers of elf-worship in the lands of Bulwar, and from their pulpits issue forth no end of seditious dogma that seeks to undermine the just rule of our glorious pack. Many of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s chiefest advisors have begged [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to raze the vile temple complex to the ground, to put an end to their loathsome preaching.\n\nYet this would be a terrible waste - Eduz-Vacyn is the religious heart of Bulwar, and by repairing its decaying temples and arranging a personal meeting between its priests and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] we could surely reach a more... agreeable arrangement."

 tluukt_krah_maga_title:0 "Krah Maga"
 tluukt_krah_maga_desc:0 "Now that we have established a more productive relationship between our great pack and the priests of Eduz-Vacyn, it strikes us that there may be other ways they could be of use to us.\n\nTheir priests hold great sway over any community they preside over, and by expanding the extent of their outreach and moderating the message they preach we could find at our beck and call a legion of zealots whom we need simply point towards our mutual enemies!"

 tluukt_field_slaughter_title:0 "Field of Slaughter"
 tluukt_field_slaughter_desc:0 "The elves of Bulwar have proven a thorny problem for our pack's supremacy. They rule over their human subjects and wield them like shields, making it all too difficult to reach their delicate throats. They think themselves safe, but we think they rely overly much on the loyalty of their 'noble' subjects.\n\nAny human who consents to fight for these elf-kings simply has not yet known true fear, and once we teach them what it means to suffer we shall see where their loyalties truly lay!"

 tluukt_promise_partition_title:0 "Promise of Partition"
 tluukt_promise_partition_desc:0 "The ambitions of our glorious pack in the northern reaches of Bulwar Proper are impeded by the harpies who lay claim to the hills and foothills of the region. In the elves and their human subjects we both find a mutual enemy, but we 'monsters' share little commonality in other matters, and there can be no doubt in the end that only one pack can reign supreme!\n\nEven so, a partition of Bulwar should prove to stave off this inevitable conflict long enough for us to secure our supremacy. Otherwise, we must here and now assert the superiority of our pack, so that they might never challenge it again!"

 tluukt_zeniths_nadir_title:0 "The Zenith's Nadir"
 tluukt_zeniths_nadir_desc:0 "The city of Medurubar is the heart of the loathsome Irrliam's power, the seat from which the plague of elf-worship radiates like an unsightly rot. Under the auspices of their religion they put to death countless heretics, building a 'paradise' from the bones of their subjects.\n\nIt falls upon our glorious pack to put an end to this vile institution, so that we can replace it with our own!"

 tluukt_birsartansbar_bash_title:0 "Birsartansbar Bash"
 tluukt_birsartansbar_bash_desc:0 "For all their ugliness, it is said that the men and women of Birsartansbar are a mirthful bunch who throw with great regularity grand celebrations, festivities they call 'masquerade balls'. Though we gnolls are all too often limited by our means, let it not be said that we don't know how to enjoy a great festival!\n\nWhile we may make for poor dance-partners, it is also said that at the conclusion of a Birsartansbar Ball a grand bonfire is held, and in this regard gnolls are experts! We shall show the people of Birsartansbar a bonfire they will never forget, in which all their ugly vanities shall burn away!"

 tluukt_reclaim_akazuak_title:0 "Reclaim Akaz Uak"
 tluukt_reclaim_akazuak_desc:0 "In the woodlands of Bahar Szel-Uak a grand kingdom once stood, long before the age of Jaher. The Tremendous Kingdom of Uak, once one of the three pillars of gnollish rule in the Bulwari Age of Monsters, was founded by Uak the Tremendous who ruled from Akaz Uak.\n\nThe Kingdom of Uak was the last of the great gnollish kingdoms to fall to the Xhazobine, yet fall it did, and in her wake the citadel of Akaz Uak was ground to dust. The squatters who dwell there now must be purged from the land, so that Akaz Uak might be reclaimed by its rightful inheritors."

 tluukt_last_bastion_title:0 "The Last Bastion"
 tluukt_last_bastion_desc:0 "Nestled safely in the foothills of the Serpentspine, the citadel of Azka-Evran is the last of the great elven citadels to elude our grasp, the last bastion of elf-worship. Its buildings are packed with the refugees of our warpath, its walls lined with the last warriors strong enough to resist us, its citadel housing the last kings who would defy us!\n\nWith its inevitable conquest, our grip over Bulwar and all its people will be ironclad, and the rule of our pack shall endure for a hundred years!"

 tluukt_rile_pack_title:0 "Rile the Pack"
 tluukt_rile_pack_desc:0 "The packs of the Šad Sur are a disorderly and riotous lot who not so long ago were fierce in their independence. Only the will of Tluukt binds these mountain tribes together into one great pack, but every day threatens the possibility of a tribe valuing its independence over its loyalty to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nThese murderous urges are to be celebrated, however! Only the fiercest are fit for Tluukt, and so we must rile the packs into one murderous force, to spill out of the Šad Sur and across the realms of elf and man!"

 tluukt_monstrous_alliance_title:0 "Monstrous Alliance"
 tluukt_monstrous_alliance_desc:0 "With the ferocity of our pack riled against our foes, we must now go forth into Bulwar and make it our own. Yet enemies abound on every side, elf and man alike arranged against the glory of our future reign. They call us 'monster', but they do not really know what we are capable of.\n\nEven so, we must find for the time being kinship amongst our fellow 'monsters' of Bulwar. Though Zokka's pack is a powerful ally, it would be prudent to stack the odds in our favor, come any... unforeseen developments, and so we must look to others as well."

 tluukt_glass_pirates_title:0 "The Glass Pirates"
 tluukt_glass_pirates_desc:0 "All across Bulwar our distinguished kind are decried as savage slavers, demonic conquerors hell-bent on destroying everything right and proper! Even if some of these accusations are accurate, it makes the matter of establishing our rule a violent and protracted affair.\n\nYet, hidden amidst the rocky crags of Drolas, there are communes of Bulwari who have grown acclimated to the wisdom of gnollish order - pirate havens ruled by matriarchs who regularly have dealings with gnollish raiders. These nearly gnollish souls chafe under the boorish subjugation of elf-kings, aloof rulers who frown upon their piratical ways! Under our... protection, however, they would be free to raid the Sea of Glass to their heart's content - provided we receive our due share, of course."

 tluukt_gatekeeping_title:0 "Gatekeeping"
 tluukt_gatekeeping_desc:0 "With the western coastline of the Šad Sur now firmly under our rule, our glorious pack has done more than secure access to the Sea of Glass. We have put into our watchful oversight the confluence of Bulwar and Sarhal - the Salahad Gate.\n\nThese passes have been witness to countless migrations of goods and people, and in particular gnolls. Our forebears first travelled through these valleys to pillage the weakened Bulwari in the Age of Monsters, we were chased through here by the Castanites in their reckless purge, and from here our kind returned once Jaher’s phoenix burned out.\n\nAll very historic moments, to be certain - but no more! We must firmly control  the Salahad Gate, such that none may pass without the explicit assent of our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 tluukt_realm_cleaver_title:0 "Realm Cleaver"
 tluukt_realm_cleaver_desc:0 "In 1443 the great conquests of our glorious pack began in earnest with the subjugation of the city of Bulwar, jewel of the Bulwari. It was there that the mighty Tluukt routed their cowardly elven suzerain with the ferocity and impact of her fiery magic, leaving the city's defenders to the mercy of our rule. With great glee we smashed their walls to dust and seized their wealth as our own - yet this was not nearly enough.\n\nWe should have pursued the craven King Karodir I to the very seat of his rule and made our domination complete with the rendering of his head from his shoulders! It falls upon us now to rectify our grave error, to truly earn the epithet 'Cleaver-of-Realms'!"

 tluukt_golden_spears_title:0 "The Golden Spears"
 tluukt_golden_spears_desc:0 "Our kind's miserable poverty surely began with the reign of that upstart Jaher. As his invincible armies advanced against our forebears, they wielded in their hands such fearsome spears of sun-like gold, spears that have to the Bulwari become symbols of hope and to us gnolls icons of pure dread.\n\nThe humans of Harklum, in particular, have preserved the authentic Jaherian Spears for generations, and continue to wield them against our kind! But this means opportunity, for such powerful weapons would suit us greatly - only weapons such as they could ever stand to hope to pierce the hide of the invincible Jaher 'Sun-King', even as he reclines in the safety of death."

 tluukt_thronebreaker_title:0 "Thronebreaker"
 tluukt_thronebreaker_desc:0 "The black flag of Sareyand flies high over a kingdom of ash. Decadent elves luxuriate in palatial estates while Bulwari laborers gladly toil in the fields below. Their kings cling bitterly to the past and weep for a glory they are too weak to restore. They are a pale shadow of the glorious kingdoms that once found their heart in the very city they rule from.\n\nWe will put to the torch their ambitions and liberate them from the agony of their failure. We shall bury their dreams amidst ashes of their own, and it is then that, like the phoenix they so dearly venerate, something new shall rise from their burnt offerings - something ever-great."

 tluukt_build_proxacha_title:0 "Proxacha the Ever-Greater"
 tluukt_build_proxacha_desc:0 "Of the three great gnollish kingdoms of the Age of Monsters - Zehia, Uak, and Proxacha - there is no doubt that the Ever-Greater True Gnoll Kingdom of Proxacha was indeed the greatest.\n\nRuling from the ruins of an ancient djinn palace, Proxacha's pack terrorized the Bulwari plains for centuries, and all number of lords and king paid her greatness tribute. Such was her pack's wealth that her palace, the Proxacha Eklu, soon became an opulent jewel and a symbol of gnollish rule.\n\nUltimately, however, this great palace was ground to utter dust in the conflicts between the Great Xhaz and the Castanites, and no palace in Sareyand since has ever hoped to rival it... until we arrived, that is!"

 tluukt_build_uak_title:0 "Uak the Tremendous"
 tluukt_build_uak_desc:0 "Though perhaps second to the greatness of Proxacha, the Tremendous Kingdom of Uak was no less fierce or enduring in its rule. From the very gates of Ovdal Tûngr to the foothills of [552.GetName], Uak ruled with an iron-claw and dominated commerce in the Gulf of Glass.\n\nIt is no surprise then that, fattened off of such abundant wealth, his pack found it necessary to build a palace of their ow  n to rival that of the Proxacha Eklu. And just as the Proxacha Eklu became a symbol of gnollish rule in the south, the Uak Eklu likewise embodied every great attribute of our kind's dominion in the north.\n\nThis palace - sacked and pillaged in the wake of the Xhazobine - must now be restored once more to serve as testament to our pack's enduring greatness!"

 tluukt_enemy_along_title:0 "An Enemy All Along"
 tluukt_enemy_along_desc:0 "With our hegemony in Bulwar Proper virtually unchallenged, it is now a certainty that our pack reigns supreme over all pretenders to our glory. Yet, it seems, the inhabitants of Bulwar have been slow in realizing this incontrovertible truth. Putting aside for now the ignorance of the elves and their human subjects, the greater challenger to our ambitions are the winged-women of the Harpy Hills, who have aspired also to restoring their ancient hegemony over these lands.\n\nPerhaps in the pursuit of our mutual enemy the harpies have grown to see us as allies - but the truth is that we have been their enemies from the start, and have always been plotting their downfall, for there can only be one ruler of all Bulwar!"

 tluukt_burn_roosts_title:0 "Burn the Roosts"
 tluukt_burn_roosts_desc:0 "The winged-women of Harpylen feel all too secure, hidden amidst the crags of their mountain roosts. In such a fashion they have cowardly extracted tribute from the ones they rule over for centuries, protected by the verticality of their dominion. But we gnolls are cleverer than they, and our pack is cleverest of all gnolls!\n\nPerhaps their winged ilk can outfly our arrows, but their chirping young and their earthly nests shall not escape the rising heat of our flames, green tongues conjured from the very depths of the sulphurous earth.\n\nRise higher wicked flame! Rise higher, choking smoke! And once you have cleansed their roosts, we shall clap into irons any who remain alive and make of them exotic slaves to be sold in Rahen and further afield!"

 tluukt_first_port_title:0 "The First Port"
 tluukt_first_port_desc:0 "We gnolls are a cunning and thrifty breed, contrary to our depictions in the dogma of Bulwari worship. Above all we crave to avoid labor which can be done by another.\n\nSecond only to the whip, the sweet allure of gold is the surest means of delegating such duties and thus many a gnoll of eld set their ambition to acquiring great sums of wealth abroad. But with our packs confined to the poverty of late, many of us have forgotten the siren call of the sea.\n\nNo more! Henceforth, from [568.GetName] we shall renew our great commerce and soon once again dominate the markets of the Gulf of Glass!"

 tluukt_monstrous_trade_title:0 "A Monstrous Trade"
 tluukt_monstrous_trade_desc:0 "At last we grapple once more with the sea, making a conquest of every voyage as we confront lands and markets abroad. Our primary export should come as no surprise, for of all thinking beasts none excel so much as gnolls in the acquisition of slaves, and there are no slaves more suited for strenuous labors than those weaned by gnollish whips.\n\nThe world no doubt desires our living cargo, yet our merchants face no small amount of persecution on foreign shores! It seems a foul reputation precedes us, and as such we must unfortunately be more discriminating in selection of our trading partners, choosing only those not swayed by baseless sentimentality."

 tluukt_avenge_surib_title:0 "Avenge the Battle of Surib"
 tluukt_avenge_surib_desc:0 "The legend of the loathsome Jaher 'Sun-King' began in Zanšap, for it was there that the feeble human kings first submitted themselves to his reign - contingent on one great undertaking: the expulsion of gnollkind from Bulwar. And indeed, the 'Sun-King' set about this task with haste, sallying forth with his elven hosts against the gnolls of the Jix Pack who at the time ruled over Zanšap. We know not how the gnolls of Jix were so weak as to be defeated by the upstart Jaher, but it was their defeat that set his invading host on the trajectory to conquer all the world. And it was in the unassuming fields of Surib where this defeat occurred, in a spectacular battle that saw countless gnolls laid to the earth, their blood to feed only flowers.\n\nThe glory of our pack can never reign supreme unless we eclipse this humiliating history with a fiery conquest of our own, a victory that shall go unchallenged for centuries."

 tluukt_sarhaly_fireiron_title:0 "Sarhaly Fire-iron"
 tluukt_sarhaly_fireiron_desc:0 "A gnoll's chief weapon is fear! Fear, and ruthless efficiency. Our two weapons are fear and ruthless efficiency, both of which must be honed constantly lest they fall to the wayside. The people of Bulwar have an almost mythical fear of our kind, and thus it falls to us to reinforce their close-minded superstition with unimpeachable facts!\n\nIn the savage lands to the south of the Salahad it is not uncommon for gnoll warriors to imbue their weapons directly with the fiery rancor of Xhazob, and this practice would suit our purposes quite well. Once the people of Bulwar bear witness to our thronging hordes wielding swords of green-flame, they will surely fall to their knees and beg for the irons!"

 tluukt_prisoners_azkabar_title:0 "The Prisoners of Azkabar"
 tluukt_prisoners_azkabar_desc:0 "The humans of Bulwar have developed an unhealthy revulsion towards the magical arts and their practitioners, to the extent that when the daughter of Jaher 'Sun-King' commanded the construction of a great prison in Azkabar to contain all the human mages of Bulwar who might challenge her weak rule, her people gladly assented!\n\nThis dark bastion has ever since stood within Azkabar, containing all number of mages who no doubt clamor for freedom, to be ruled over by ones who can appreciate their dark art. Fortunately, our kind have a great need for their skills, and so once again mages shall rule in Bulwar, as agents of our pack!"

 tluukt_new_age_title:0 "A New Age for Monsters"
 tluukt_new_age_desc:0 "Our pack is without parallel, for we have set out to accomplish the will of Tluukt. Where our contemporaries raze and slaughter with reckless abandon, we do so only at the direction of our glorious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who preserves all that is of use to our pack and sets to flame the rest. Every conquest has been carefully considered, every fiery vengeance checked by a cool cunning. We have long labored to shed the primitive trappings of our impoverished mountain homes, to aspire to the glory of the ancient gnollish kingdoms of the past, to rule over all Bulwar!\n\nAnd now, from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne in [Root.Capital.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] ruler of a broad dominion ranging over all Bulwar Proper. At last we have become sole inheritors of the past. At last, it falls to us to define with rigid certainty the future greatness of our pack!"

 tluukt_lessons_elfwar_title:0 "Lessons of the Elfwar"
 tluukt_lessons_elfwar_desc:0 "The elf-kings of Bulwar have ruled over vast dominions for many centuries, virtually unchallenged except by their own in-fighting. Yet they do not rule except for the assent of their countless human subjects, who bow willingly at the feet of their elven suzerains.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Bulwar desires to be subjugated - their kings crave the security that being ruled over provides. They may bitterly scream against the villainy of gnolls, but such complaints will surely be mollified by the illusion of self-determination that our indirect rule provides them. Their coffers will fuel our war-efforts, and their gold shall become the chains that bind their fellows down beneath us. This much, it can be said, is the wisdom of the elves."

 tluukt_struggle_appointment_title:0 "Struggle for Appointment"
 tluukt_struggle_appointment_desc:0 "In establishing a vast network of indirect rule over Bulwar, we have acquired all number of tributaries, vassals, and other subjects. We have raised up kings and we have shattered ancient crowns, all in pursuit of our pack's ambition. Yet if we are not judicious, our ever-growing administration will soon threaten to collapse over our heads..\n\nTo avert this possibility, we must conspire to ensure frequent competition between our subjects and other agents of our administration. Constancy is stagnancy, and a subordinate secure in their position is one who begins to accumulate his own web of loyalties. By making every appointment a grand struggle and ensuring our subjects are ever-threatened by the prospect of replacement, our administration will be defined by loyalty first, ability second."

 tluukt_paper_reforms_title:0 "Paper Reforms"
 tluukt_paper_reforms_desc:0 "It seems that our antiquated systems of record keeping are insufficient for the intricate accounting made necessary by our rapidly-growing hierarchies. The traditional method of record-keeping amongst gnolls of the Šad Sur involves notching bones, and while this may ably record the number of slaves taken in a raid or the number of cubs born in a year, it cannot account for the more sophisticated needs of a modern kingdom.\n\nFortunately, it seems that the Bulwari have developed all manner of methods for recording the activities of a realm, and we see no reason not to adopt them - they are at once both familiar to our subjects and more capable than our own methods. Central to all systems of Bulwari record-keeping, however, is vast quantities of paper, and so our pack must ensure a steady supply is always available."

 tluukt_eclipse_east_title:0 "The Eclipse in the East"
 tluukt_eclipse_east_desc:0 "When our pack sallied forth from the Šad Sur, we found that we were not the sole gnolls of ambition in Bulwar. To our east, the one known as Zokka 'Devourer-of-Suns' had been securing a reputation as a monstrous warlord with no fear of the elves. We were content to forge an alliance of mutual interest with Zokka - his dominion was that of Far Bulwar, a land of desert and ruins occupied only by nomads and harpies, a land that held little value to Tluukt.\n\nUnbeknownst to us, however, a power is rising in the east that threatens to eclipse all competition and endanger our very own ambitions, a power that we cannot leave unchecked."
 
 tluukt_curtail_liberators_title:0 "Curtail Liberators"
 tluukt_curtail_liberators_desc:0 "As the jewel of the Bulwari plains, the city of Bulwar has long enjoyed a close relationship with its fellow neighbors, who look upon the grand city with equal parts reverence and jealousy. This makes our brutal suppression of the city something of an issue. Though we defanged the city's defenders and ground to dust its ancient walls, every day they conspire with their neighbors to overthrow our rule.\n\nSuch seditious sentiments can only be rewarded with death and destruction, again and again, until the ugly beast that is Bulwari sovereignty is rendered an antiquated ideal of the past. First, though, we must find evidence of this conspiracy."

 tluukt_treaty_grumar_title:0 "Treaty of Grumar"
 tluukt_treaty_grumar_desc:0 "This mission is pending removal."

 tluukt_zanbar_crushed_title:0 "Zanbar Crushed"
 tluukt_zanbar_crushed_desc:0 "The people of Zanbar were fools to consider themselves equals of Bulwar. Foolish to believe that their close relations with our precious jewel would go unpunished. Foolish to believe they might receive the mercy of mere subjugation beneath our pack. We will make a bonfire of Zanbar, kindling of all its people, such that the flame might be seen from the lowest tower in Bulwar, such that the smell of ash might hang heavy over the Suran for days.\n\nOur message is clear - this is the price of sedition, of rejecting the glorious will of Tluukt. All that remains is to see whether the city of Bulwar has ears to hear it."

 tluukt_zokka_eclipsed_title:0 "Zokka Eclipsed"
 tluukt_zokka_eclipsed_desc:0 "Our ranks now swell with refugees, gnolls who fled the advance of the Jaddarin army following Zokka’s decapitation. Yet just as many refugees of Zokka's defeat remain within the freshly conquered territory of Jaddari, unable or unwilling to flee their homes.\n\nIf we can but prove the superiority of our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] over that simple-minded thug Zokka, these refugees will become staunch loyalists to Tluukt, for all gnolls recognize power. And, with the support of our agents, these refugees can just as easily become insurgents against Jaddarin rule."

 tluukt_bloodless_siege_title:0 "A Bloodless Siege"
 tluukt_bloodless_siege_desc:0 "For many long years Zokka battled fruitlessly with the occupants of the great Bulwari fortress of Azka-Sur. Though he secured countless victories over them, in the end it seems he failed to crack their walls. And they are mighty walls indeed, and were we to besiege them though our pack would no doubt triumph it would come at a great loss.\n\nBut the defenders of Azka-Sur have lived nearly a generation under constant siege - first from Zokka, and then from Jaddar, and now from us. The tension within the citadel must surely be at the breaking point - and with a show of strength, we might yet break them without shedding a drop of blood."

 tluukt_reconvene_pact_title:0 "Reconvene the Pact"
 tluukt_reconvene_pact_desc:0 "The pact shared between Zokka 'Devourer-of-Suns' and Astarta Siadan of the Siadan Harpies was nothing short of unprecedented - an alliance forged between gnolls and harpies would have once been considered inconceivable, for there is no love lost between our kind. Yet a mutual enemy has made strange bedfellows of us all, and may yet continue to do so.\n\nIn the wake of Zokka's utter defeat, Siadan now finds themselves short on allies and surrounded by enemies. Though we are in a far less precarious position, extending a paw of aid towards the east would nevertheless provide our pack a valuable ally in a remote battleground."

 tluukt_horse_training_title:0 "Horse Training"
 tluukt_horse_training_desc:0 "As tradition dictates, the warriors of our pack are mustered from the ranks of our subordinate tribes and serve the will of Tluukt with no shortage of loyalty or ferocity. Yet each tribe is responsible for the upbringing of their own warriors, and as a result the forces at our pack's disposal are often more a disorganized mob than any cohesive force.\n\nWe cannot enter into battle against the Jaddarin horse-warriors with such a mess of tribal warriors. For all their ferocity, they would be overwhelmed just as Zokka was. We will undertake the direct training of our warriors as befits the needs of our glorious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They will become stronger than oxen and swifter than horses, and they will be loyal to Tluukt above all else."

 tluukt_avenge_zokka_title:0 "Avenge Zokka"
 tluukt_avenge_zokka_desc:0 "With the death of Zokka 'Devourer-of-Suns', the task of avenging him against the Jaddarin horse-warriors fell upon our pack. In truth, there was no great deal of love shared between our two packs and indeed we benefited greatly from the decimation of Zokka's forces. Yet the will of Tluukt is to avenge all gnollkind against the undertakings of elves, and in this matter Zokka's demise is no exception!"

 tluukt_phoenix_downed_title:0 "Phoenix Downed"
 tluukt_phoenix_downed_desc:0 "To avenge the death of Zokka, nothing less than the utter destruction of the Jaddari will suffice.\n\nWe shall wrest their warriors who have witnessed a hundred battles from their horses and make corpses of all their wisdom and experience. We shall seize their human allies who have entrusted their futures to the elves and make corpses of all their faith and love. We shall drive their armies into the furthest corner of their decaying citadel and force them to witness as we make a corpse of their beloved Herald.\n\nAnd then, just as nothing will remain of Jaddar, nothing shall remain of his legion."

 tluukt_harpy_march_title:0 "The Harpymarch"
 tluukt_harpy_march_desc:0 "The noble [F48.Monarch.GetTitle] [F48.Monarch.GetName] [F48.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] looks nothing short of striking with the golden crest of rule gracing her savage head. Yet even as all the winged-women of Siadan look upon their [F48.Monarch.GetTitle] with no shortage of fealty and reverence, to our glorious pack she is but one of countless subjects who kneel in the presence of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName].\n\nAnd even as she parades through the streets of [F48.Capital.GetName], celebrating the ascendancy of Siadan over all rival flocks, she surely thinks of this too. Perhaps she seethes, or perhaps she finds solace in subjugation. In the end, she pays her tribute all the same."

 tluukt_strengthening_pact_title:0 "Strengthening the Pact"
 tluukt_strengthening_pact_desc:0 "Though we have long held an alliance with Zokka's pack, it is one that has been untested by the tribulations of battle against a mutual foe. In gnollish society it is often thought that one cannot put their trust in a comrade unless they have shed blood together. Of course, we do not trust Zokka to any degree whatsoever, but before we can consider betraying their trust we must first ensure that they do indeed trust us!"

 tluukt_gnolls_united_title:0 "Gnolls United"
 tluukt_gnolls_united_desc:0 "To be set upon all sides by gnoll warbands is an unenviable position indeed, in particular when your foes are the glorious pack of Tluukt and the considerably less glorious pack of Zokka. For our foes in Sareyand, this war must seem the coming of the end. For our pack, it is but one step amongst many in disarming Zokka's suspicions, though that is not to say that we take no delight in the despoilation of a misbegotten elven kingdom."

 tluukt_friends_forever_title:0 "Friends Forever"
 tluukt_friends_forever_desc:0 "Even more than shedding blood together, it is said amongst gnolls that a true friend is one who shares with you freely a share of their pillage. We are not such close friends with Zokka to consider that, but they seem content with the bloodshedding of a mutual foe.

Our Bulwari subjects have become wise to the glory of our rule, and with each passing day we begin to see a little of our own greatness in them where before there was nothing.\n\nIndeed, as the spread of our reach expands across the wider world beyond Bulwar, it may now be prudent to relax the hierarchies first scrawled by the great lawgiver Tluukt. These castes were originally established not because we believed the mantle of rule fit only for gnollish shoulders, but because only gnolls had strength enough to seize it!\n\nIf our human subjects can now prove their own strength despite all the amenities afforded by blind subservience, then are they not in many ways akin to true gnolls?

In the days of eld, when the gnollish Bulwari were content to dwell within primitive huts amidst rural crags, we cemented the bonds of blood with great trials of athleticism - a ritual that is not unfamiliar to the human Bulwari, either, though their sports differ in their technical details.

The elven high-priests, many presiding since the days of Jaher, pass away one by one - illness and weakness, supposedly. They are replaced not by elves, but by men of no distinguished education and of dubious backgrounds. These men begin to rally against the elves, against Jaher, against the very foundation of the new teachings. They clamor for a return to the old ways, a return to a cult that glorifies Surakel and not mortal elves.\n\nThe rest of Bulwar has unsurprisingly condemned Eduz-Vacyn, seeing the taint of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s influence for what it is and censoring the teachings of the temple.

Instead, Uak's ancient kingdom saw a high integration of native Bulwari into its rule, and the locals often worked alongside the ruling gnolls in all the many labors of governance.\n\nOf course, no trace of either the tribute or the co-operation required to amass it remain within the scattered bricks of [550.GetName] - much like the Proxacha Eklu, the palace was rendered a ruin by the wrath of the Xhazobine.

Her tenuous grip on the gnoll tribes of the Šad Sur, sustained more by fear than any true sense of loyalty, ultimately collapsed as she approached the end, leaving her successors the unenviable task of crushing the rebellious pretenders.

It is the promise of restoring to us these halcyon days that binds our glorious pack to Tluukt's ambitions, yet even among gnolls there are few who understand what such a rule would truly mean. In the wake of the Xhazobine's fury, the Castanite's reprisal, and the long centuries of decay that followed thereafter, these tales were lost to us - effaced by the withering winds of the Salahad.\n\nBut Tluukt herself still remembers. Each tale passed down from matron to matron, Tluukt would not stand here today if her line had forgotten the ancient glory of gnolls. Her mind races, its imagination captivated by the matriarchs of eld, who ruled for long centuries lands of prosperity, sagely guided by age and experience.\n\nIn those bygone days, it was said that the gnoll packs elevated their matriarchs to Queens not out of fear or subservience to strength, but out of respect for their surpassing wisdom, and to Tluukt this seems right and proper. Yet for all their wisdom, in the end it was unabiding strength - the Xhazobine herself - that laid those matriarchs low. It was strength, not wisdom, that brought Tluukt to where she is today.\n\nAnd now, in the twilight years of her reign, Tluukt must set forth an example of rule that shall be carried forth by all her successors - shall the old tales finally be forgot, or shall her line now and forever reject the Xhazobine's dark model?"

Yet our future is still not secured, and every day we must fight to ensure our ancient legacy is not eroded by upstarts. And we are alone.\n\nYet, to our south, amidst the peaks of the Šad Sur, a new contender enters the stage of Bulwar - a gnoll matriarch by the name of Tluukt, who some call 'Cleaver-of-Realms'. Our policy has long been one of vitriol and distrust to the gnolls, but this rising pack near the very heart of Bulwar Proper represents an irresistible opportunity..."

Direct rule over the desert sands seems more and more to be a fool's gambit - it is impossible for us to reign in the resistance by force, and the zealots will never willingly submit to what they foolishly call the 'Malevolent Dark'.\n\nThough gnolls are the masters of the world, the Far Salahad poses a unique problem we are ill-disposed in dealing with, a problem that continues to distract us from more worthy conquests elsewhere.\n\nYet among our pack there are no small number of gnolls who are all too familiar with the desert sands of the Far Salahad - the Zokka refugees who were absorbed into our pack following the fall of their packlord. Indeed, aware of our difficulties with the region, one bold whelp has stepped forth - a former lieutenant of Zokka's who has served both his pack and our own with distinction. She has offered to command the Zokka refugees in reclaiming the Far Salahad, where they will suppress the nomads and rule in our name - subservient, yet sovereign.\n\nThough this arrangement would certainly solve our difficulties with controlling the region, it would no doubt upset the other gnoll tribes who have long labored under the ideal that all packs are equal beneath Tluukt."

 tluukt_tluuktraak_reform:0 "The All-Cleaving Kingdom of Tluukt"
 tluukt_tluuktraak_reform_desc:0 "In the ancient days of Bulwar's bygone Age of Monsters, gnoll matriarchs ruled over the lesser gnoll packs and the native Bulwari in elaborate and sometimes even equitable hierarchies. The rise of the Great Xhaz, however, spelled the end of these arrangements, and though in the centuries since Bulwar has seen its fair share of kingdoms ruled by gnollkind, none come close to the glorious states conceived by those gnolls of antiquity - or so it was until Tluukt 'Cleaver-of-Realms' cleaved anew her own realm and codified the laws and hierarchies still in use today by the Tluuktraak."

 tluukt_litter_reform:0 "Restricted Litter Cannibalism"
 tluukt_litter_reform_desc:0 "The Litter Reforms put a controversial end to the various practices of litter cannibalism amongst gnoll packs by restricting intra-litter competition to only the cubs born from the matriarch of our pack herself. Any other gnoll cub whose mother is unable or unwilling to equitably provide for them is seized as a ward of the pack.\n\nThese reforms serve a number of purposes - reducing cub mortality increases the number of gnolls available to be utilized, and cubs directly raised by the pack are invariably the most loyal. Most importantly, by restricting litter cannibalism to the highest echelon of our society, we ensure that our rulers are only those weaned by the survival of the fittest, and that those they rule are born weaker as a result of their soft upbringings."
  
 tluukt_xalgekyr_reform:0 "Formalized Xalgekyr"
 tluukt_xalgekyr_reform_desc:0 "The practice of slavery is an ancient and time-honored tradtion, and can by no means ever be abolished. Yet, while our attitude towards slavery is what distinguishes gnollish society above all others, the practice of industrious free-enterprise slavers seizing at their discretion whatever krah strikes their fancy is an antiquated and self-destructive system.\n\nBy directly administrating the enslavement of krah as a matter of state and imposing a xalgekyr - a blood tax to be levied against all krah in accordance to their hierarchy - not only will we impose order upon a chaotic occupation, we will actually increase the number and quality of slaves available to our purposes as a result of stricter and more even-spread acquisition. The blood-tax need not be paid in blood alone, of course - the wealthy and influential are free to buy from our pack their own weights in gold."
  
 tluukt_littlepack_reform:0 "The Little Pack"
 tluukt_littlepack_reform_desc:0 "The loyalties of our Bulwari subjects have often at times been challenged by their own self-interests. Gnoll hegemons of the past have sought to curb these self-interests with the penalties of pain and suffering, but we have grown wiser to the needs of our subjects.\n\nBy relaxing the rigid hierarchies established by Tluukt and allowing for some social mobility among our krah subjects, we can engender a greater fealty than the threat of a whip ever could. The trick lay in the price of this mobility - much like true gnolls, those Bulwari who seek to elevate themselves must do so at the expense of their fellows, such that only the most worthy may ascend. And, of course, this new 'Little Pack' will always be subservient to our greater pack."
