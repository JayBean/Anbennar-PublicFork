The few mythological accounts of a Xhazob describe a huge quadrupedal monster exhibiting a chaotic mixture of predatory features, wreathed in green flames and emanating a palpable aura of dread.\n\nXhazobs are largely uninterested in the affairs of mortals, but instead like sharks to the scent of blood are drawn through the outer planes to mass slaughter and suffering. This is invariably how contact is initially made with a Xhazob, and once a pact is struck they will demand ever greater violence from their erstwhile host, feasting on the souls of those slain in their name before they will deign to join with the supplicant and create a new [Root.xhaz_gender_tt]."

The roaring of the great fire seems to change, more guttural and animalistic somehow,as though alive.

They bare their teeth as a twisted mark is singed into their flesh. The pyre flares once more before being snuffed out, as suddenly as though a great wind had passed through.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] turns to the assembled horde, the mark on their brow blazing with a profane light. Their roar of triumph is echoed across the camp as the horde breaks into exultant celebration. The Xhazob has tasted the initial offering and is most pleased!"
