 # Railskulker Events
 railskulker.2.t:0 "Engineers Have Come to Help Our Military"
 railskulker.2.d:0 "In order to help our military, we have rounded up some skilled engineers and tinkerers to improve the capabilities of our military. What they do is up to you. The more we develop our armed forces, the more options we'll have."
 railskulker.2.a:0 "Have them hand out experimental weaponry."
 railskulker.2.b:0 "Have them tinker with our siege artillery."
 railskulker.2.c:0 "Have them maintain our siege artillery."
 railskulker.2.e:0 "They should supervise our weapon production."
 railskulker.2.f:0 "Set them to improving the armories."
 railskulker.2.g:0 "Have them make us some extra siege guns."
 railskulker.3.t:0 "A New Capital for Goblinkind?"
 railskulker.3.d:0 "We have expanded beyond our roots, and must decide whether our seat of power should evolve too. The dwarves' great capital has fallen before us, should we take it as our own to truly show who rules the Serpentspine?"
 railskulker.3.a:0 "Er Natvir is the capital of goblinkind!"
 railskulker.3.b:0 "Let us preserve Amldihr"
 railskulker.4.t:0 "The Breadth of the Dwarovar"
 railskulker.4.d:0 "Now that the age of orcish supremacy in the Dwarovar has truly come to end, it has become possible to scout far off sections and update our maps. This will no doubt be useful."
 railskulker.4.a:0 "We now know the full extent we must conquer."
 railskulker.5.t:0 "The Future of Our Military"
 railskulker.5.d:0 "As we expand our influence in the Dwarovar, we have begun recruiting from goblins that exist outside the wall of Er-Natvir, impressing them into our forces as fodder. While this has worked for the smaller disorganized groups of goblins that have so far been the main path of our expansion, the subjugation of two organized clans have given us an opportunity to improve our system. Two generals have put forward proposals.\n\nThe first is Yeet Jozmini, a grizzled veteran who has lead sappers and artillerists in our past battles. His plan calls for the integration of these clans fully into our military and a greater focus on gunpowder and engineering as part of our army.\n\nThe second general is Yeet Kozwitz, a young up and comer who believes that subjugated clans should be organized into battleclans, which will be obligated to train and provide a levy for our wars of expansion. He argues that this levy will provide more and higher quality troops than we could via centralized training.\n\nWhichever general we choose will shape the future of our military."
 railskulker.5.a:0 "Go with Jozmini and create a technocratic army."
 railskulker.5.b:0 "Go with Kozwitz and create and formalize a system of levies."
 railskulker.6.t:0 "A Delegation from the $FROM$ Battleclan has Arrived"

Under the system established by Jozmini, we can put the best of their warriors under our direct command. Alternately, if $FROM$ is too weak or we simply wish otherwise, we can send military advisors to help the forces under their command."
 railskulker.6.a:0 "Integrate their best warriors under our command. Let the enemy face our united might!  \n\n§TThey are §YElite§!: they won't cost any army professionalism.§!"
 railskulker.6.b:0 "Send some advisors to help $FROM$. They are looking rather weak."
 
 railskulker.7.t:0 "The $ROOT$ Military Engineer Corps"
 railskulker.7.d:0 "We have established a formal military engineer corps and now train promising recruits for this role rather than relying on preexisting expertise. We should choose a focus for military engineers serving in our army."
 railskulker.7.a:0 "Have them work with our sappers"
 railskulker.7.b:0 "Have them work with our artillery crews."
 
 railskulker.8.t:0 "Reforming the Artillery Yards"
 railskulker.8.d:0 "We have embarked on a series of reforms aimed at improving our production of artillery.What should we focus our efforts on? Quantity or Quality?."
 railskulker.8.a:0 "Set up the yards for mass production."
 railskulker.8.b:0 "Ensure every gun is made to the highest quality."

 railskulker.9.t:0 "Technocrats Debate the Role of Engineering In our Military"
 railskulker.9.d:0 "Technological advancement and a large body of military engineers has made our army into something fearsome. $ROOT$ has become synonymous with the thudering sound of gunfire and the boom of detonations. Yet there remains a debate on the exact way that technology and our engineers should enhance the army. One camp believes that our engineers should be focused on advancing our technology at a rapid pace, while the other believes that our engineers are most useful directly serving in the military. The outcome of this debate could have an impact on developing factions within our society."
 railskulker.9.a:0 "A focus on practical applications of our knowledge would serve us better."
 railskulker.9.b:0 "Technological advancement should come before all else."
 
 railskulker.10.t:0 "A Goblin Army"
 railskulker.10.d:0 "How do we want to organize our army? It is a question only the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can decide, but it shall undoubtedly determine the future of our nation."
 railskulker.10.a:0 "Let our military be a pathway to this new thing called 'citizenship'."
 railskulker.10.b:0 "Open our military to free market forces, under the cartels' direction!"
 
 railskulker.11.t:0 "The Many Uses of Bombs"
 railskulker.11.d:0 "Ah, bombs. Glorious bombs. Few things are as near and dear to a goblin's heart. But that prized status means we do not have enough munitions, especially not high-quality ones, for all the projects they could be used for. How should we prioritize our bomb supply?"
 railskulker.11.a:0 "We should use our explosives to dig."
 railskulker.11.b:0 "Focus on expanding the size of our caverns and railways."

Originally something he thought up to amuse goblin children during festivals, he later realized its military uses when two young goblin lads found his stash at a party and set off the biggest one they could find, resulting in a catastrophic display."
 g_the_fellowship_of_the_gun_title:0 "Fellowship of the Gun"
 g_the_fellowship_of_the_gun_desc:0 "Our generals have come together for the council of Ezrolnd, a semi-regular meeting of our greatest military and magical minds. They are discussing ways to improve upon the magical enhancements of Gazdalk and ideally how to scale them down to use with our infantry’s firearms."
 g_gazdalk_the_white_title:0 "Gazdalk the White"
 g_gazdalk_the_white_desc:0 "After many years of studying and researching, Gazdalk the White has decided that the best way to improve upon his formulas is to test them in the field. For that purpose, he has been given command of an army to do with as he pleases."

 g_the_return_of_the_clanboss_desc:0 "With a fine company of advisors behind him and strong generals leading the way, the true king has emerged, Arzorn Mountainshark. Hiding for many years under the guise of Arzorn the Strider, he has served in our armies and advised our rulers. But now it is time for him to take his rightful place as heir to the throne."
 
 # Snotfinger Missions
 g_the_runaway_slaves_title:0 "The Runaway Slaves"
 g_the_runaway_slaves_desc:0 "Before Dookanson fell upon Escann, Rurnor Snotfinger led a band of his fellow slaves in a daring escape that saved our clan from certain destruction in the Greentide. Now, we must devote ourselves to punishing the orcish oppressors, beginning with the unfortunate few who cross our path as we traverse the Dwarovar. Until the last orc falls, we will never be truly free."
 g_the_new_menace_title:0 "The New Menace"
 g_the_new_menace_desc:0 "Since the end of the Greentide, roving bands of dwarves have returned to their ancestral homeland with the hope of rekindling their ancient glory. Dwarves are almost as dangerous as orcs, and both must be driven from the mountains before they can gather their strength and move against us."
 g_never_again_title:0 "Never Again"
 g_never_again_desc:0 "When Dookanson’s horde first forced us into submission, we were a disorganized rabble and they were a mighty army. Now they fight amongst themselves for the scraps of his conquest and their forces are divided. We could never have withstood the full might of the horde, but our army is more than a match for these scattered remnants. We should destroy them one by one, and leave behind nothing but their bones."
 g_the_breakers_broken_and_the_crown_shattered_title:0 "Broken and Shattered"
 g_the_breakers_broken_and_the_crown_shattered_desc:0 "The breakers must be broken, the crown must be shattered.\n\nSiegebreaker has been eradicated, Shattered Crown has fallen beneath our blades, and now Amldihr is ours! The beating heart of the old Dwarven Empire is open to us, and even now our armies search the ruined halls in search of forgotten relics. With the resources of this Hold, the dwarves ruled over a mighty empire, and it is only fitting that we should do the same. All that remains is to purge the last traces of the orcs, and expel any survivors."
 g_the_warriors_with_words_title:0 "Warriors with Words"
 g_the_warriors_with_words_desc:0 "We’re the best around, and we’re not afraid to let everyone know it! We’ve crushed the orcs, battered the dwarves, and sit as the undisputed masters of the Northern Serpentspine. Throws our enemies into a proper rage to see us reach such heights while they scramble for our table scraps, and that’s the way we like it!"
 g_all_orcs_must_die_title:0 "All Orcs Must Die"
 g_all_orcs_must_die_desc:0 "How can you tell a good orc from a bad one? A good orc isn’t breathing!"
 g_no_more_black_orcs_title:0 "No More Black Orcs"
 g_no_more_black_orcs_desc:0 "The Black Orcs used to skulk through the Dwarovar, pillaging indiscriminately and tormenting our ancestors. Eradicating them was a major step on our road to vengeance, but there are Orcs outside our tunnels who we still haven’t taught to properly fear us. That’ll have to be corrected"
 g_get_the_escanni_ones_too_title:0 "The Escanni Ones Too!"
 g_get_the_escanni_ones_too_desc:0 "Escann is still infested with the last remnants of the Greentide. While these “civilized” orcs feud with each other and their human neighbours, let's give ‘em a taste of their own medicine. It’s only fitting that the scions of the Greentide are destroyed by our endless armies pouring out of the mountains."
 g_dont_let_the_ones_in_rahen_live_title:0 "Don't Forget About Rahen!"
 g_dont_let_the_ones_in_rahen_live_desc:0 "An orc is an orc, even when it's shackled by Hobgoblins. We’ve got no quarrel with The Command, but we’ve got unfinished business with their slaves, so they’ll have to find someone else to boss around. ‘All orcs must die’ means all orcs, even the ones with dangerous benefactors."
 g_the_job_is_done_title:0 "The Job is Done"
 g_the_job_is_done_desc:0 "Height, strength, and ferocity made no difference against our ingenuity and cunning. The orcs fell before us, as we always knew they would. For the first time in history, civilization can prosper without fear of orcish genocide. Spread the news far and wide lads, and tell everyone to rejoice - the world has been cleansed of every last orc!\n\nNow that our work is done, we might finally have enough free time to punish the others who've wronged us over the years. After all, a goblin's work is never done."
 
 # Greedy Grin Missions
 g_the_despoilers_of_hehodovar_title:0 "The Hehodovar Haul"
 g_the_despoilers_of_hehodovar_desc:0 "Hehodovar has been infested with orcs since long ago when the dwarves fled that hold. Our armies are itching to get in there and see what’s left of value but we’ll have to get through those orcs first. Our Clanboss has been getting them ready for some time to be able to get in and out quickly."
 g_despoiling_seghdihr_title:0 "Seizing Seghdihr"
 g_despoiling_seghdihr_desc:0 "The dwarves of Seghdihr are still weak and their hold is likely filled with treasure long stored in preparation for expansion. Perhaps we should take it off their hands."
 g_the_hold_of_gold_title:0 "The Hold of Gold"
 g_the_hold_of_gold_desc:0 "Now that we’ve looted Seghdihr, we have the funds to assemble enough of an army to take Verkal Gulan, the Gold Hold. The ultimate prize has been out of reach for too long, but soon our Clanboss will eat, sleep, sit, and bath in or on gold."
 g_buying_our_way_to_bigness_title:0 "Buy Our Way to Bigness"

 g_the_coin_filled_mountains_desc:0 "So. Much. Gold. It brings a tear to the eye of every goblin that passes. With all these coins and trinkets, we will never run short of good luck."
 
 # Spiderwretch Missions
 g_a_clan_in_the_spiderdens_title:0 "A Clan in the Spiderdens"
 g_a_clan_in_the_spiderdens_desc:0 "The Spiderdens are a collection of caves and crevices named for the obscene amount of spiders that populate and call it home. The dangers of these caves is apparent immediately, with one only having to glance up briefly to see massive webs stretching through miles of still cave air, and those are only the ones visible to the darklight eye.\n\nEven here, in this seemingly neverending pit of predators and their hapless victims, we goblins have found a way to thrive, learning to live in a tenuous harmony with the spiders - wild and domesticated alike, creating a society suspended on their iron-hard webs."
 g_perfecting_venombrew_title:0 "Perfect Venombrew"
 g_perfecting_venombrew_desc:0 "Where a dwarf has his favorite ale, a goblin has his favorite stimulant.\n\nVenombrew began its history as a common tincture used by goblins and extracted from the fangs of the spiders that live amongst them. Spider venom has a variety of effects depending on the species, but the kind that are dominant within the Spiderdens were known for producing a type of venom with a curious, hallucinogenic side-effect. Goblins of the Spiderdens have always been known for ingesting the substance pure to whip themselves into painless furies for raids, but our clan has come up with a recipe for turning it into a sweet drink and a damn good time."
 g_all_encompassing_ruler_title:0 "All Encompassing Ruler"
 g_all_encompassing_ruler_desc:0 "The ruler of a goblin clan often has somewhat loose control over their subjects, as ruling over a race as unruly as the goblins is a task that comes difficult, even to goblins themselves. However, the dwellers of the Spiderdens have always done things a little differently.\n\nRuling from thrones of iron-hard web, often commandeered by our strongest warriors from absolutely massive broodmothers, our rulers have reigned with a surprising degree of control - as is necessary in a land where one wrong move can often mean the doom of the whole clan.\n\nIt is said that from these thrones of web they can sense even minor disturbances in their territories from the vibrations made through the ever-expanding weave."
 g_uniting_the_spiderlands_title:0 "Uniting the Spiderlands"
 g_uniting_the_spiderlands_desc:0 "The Spiderdens have long been a hotbed of conflict between both rival clans of goblins and spider families vying for domination over territory. Now, united under our tattered banner, we have come to rule over this land of predators and their cruel machinations.\n\nWith the thrones of the crushed clans embedded into our boss's own grand throne, and their trusted spider steeds consumed by the boss's personal broodmother, we now rule uncontested over the fangs and webs necessary to ensnare the rest of the Serpentspine."
 g_the_clan_on_spiderback_title:0 "A Clan on Spiderback"
 g_the_clan_on_spiderback_desc:0 "The sight of the massive webs and spiders infesting the open air of the Spiderdens has long been a source of fear for its denizens, with poets from the age of the dwarves describing our lands as wild and brutal, to be avoided and prepared for when necessity comes to enter them. Unfortunately for them, our clanboss has decided that the scope of these dens is insufficiently small for the grand imagination of our peoples.\n\nSoon the entire Serpentspine will bear witness to our empire, with the Spiderdens serving as the beating heart for a new Dwarovar of silk and spiders."
 
 # Truedagger Missions
 g_a_clan_in_the_pass_title:0 "A Clan in the Pass"
 g_a_clan_in_the_pass_desc:0 "With a hold to call our own, the Northern Pass now lies open before us. So much space and so many goblin tribes just waiting for us to subjugate them. However, before we can expand, we must bring the lands we’ve already taken from the dwarves properly under our control."
 g_making_nice_title:0 "Making Nice"
 g_making_nice_desc:0 "The orcs of the Shattered Crown and the goblins of the Railskulker clan could make powerful allies for us, surrounded as we are by them and Duran’s lot within this branch of the Serpentspine. If we could secure alliances with them, we would be able to focus our efforts on Duran and his Company. And if they happen to get comfortable with us, it would make putting a knife in their backs all the easier, once we’re ready."
 g_bashing_blueshields_badly_title:0 "Bashing Blueshields"
 g_bashing_blueshields_badly_desc:0 "Now that we have our back secured, it is time to deal with the last dwarves in this part of the Serpentspine: The Company of Duran Blueshield. They have been a nuisance and an impediment to our expansion for too long and if left unchecked they will no doubt settle into a hold from which they will expand and fortify.  We must deal with them before they can hunker down but their knowledge and skills are also far too valuable to just destroy. The Clanboss believes that subjugation would be a far better choice."
 g_stopping_the_krak_title:0 "Stop Up the Krak"
 g_stopping_the_krak_desc:0 "We thought there were no dwarves left this far north but it seems we were mistaken. There is a hold in the Giant’s Anvil mountains where a clan of dwarves seems to have held out. We’ve found records in an ancient dwarven library in what was once Dûr Vazhatun that tell of the Quartz dwarves of Krakdhûmvror. They are said to be extremely hard to kill, a society of dwarves willing to give anything for the survival of their hold. They have bested ice giants, other holds, goblins, and orcs.\n\nHowever, it also says they have no desire to leave their precious hold or even the Giant’s Anvil mountains. Perhaps, instead of defeating them outright, it would be better to simply keep them bottled up there alone."
 g_top_10_dwarovar_betrayals_title:0 "Top Ten Betrayals"
 g_top_10_dwarovar_betrayals_desc:0 "With the threat of the dwarves contained there is only one last group we must dominate to gain supremacy over this portion of the Serpentspine: our allies which have stood by us for so long. However, a simple knife in the back won't suffice this time. You kill one Clanboss and another will always take his place. No, we must conquer them the old-fashioned way, with strategy and might. The time for our rise to power has finally come."
 
 # Thieving Arrows Missions
 g_a_clan_embattled_title:0 "A Clan Embattled"
 g_a_clan_embattled_desc:0 "There are many would be contenders for goblin supremacy in the Serpentreach and we have been fighting them all for a long time. Our armies are becoming used to these fights and the more we win the more we learn. We have begun to use these lessons to defeat our rivals and our armies are coming out further and further on top."
 g_a_skomdihr_way_we_go_title:0 "Skomdihr Way We Go"
 g_a_skomdihr_way_we_go_desc:0 "We have come to realize that, if we are to solidify our hold on the Serpentsreach, we’ll need a hold to solidify. The nearby hold of Verkal Skomdihr should do nicely, once we get it fixed up of course."
 g_between_a_garnet_and_a_diamond_hard_place_title:0 "Garnet and Diamond"
 g_between_a_garnet_and_a_diamond_hard_place_desc:0 "Now that we’ve secured and fixed up our new hold, we’ve been able to organize scouting parties to map out the Serpentreach. There seem to be several dwarven threats building up from the old holds of Ovdal Lodhum and Arg-Ôrdstun, putting us in a very dangerous situation. If we are to maintain this small hold we’ve carved out for ourselves, we’ll need them out of the way."
 g_hunting_blackbeard_title:0 "Hunting Blackbeard"
 g_hunting_blackbeard_desc:0 "While the other holds were a military threat to our new domain, the Blackbeard Cartel is something different altogether. Being a criminal organization long before they came back to the Dwarovar, they are used to operating from the shadows and maintaining a hold where they have no business doing so.  While we may have dealt with them militarily, they will remain an unseen thorn in our side, undercutting our merchants and punishing our own cartels’ control until we have removed all dwarves from the Serpentreach.  Only then will they have no shadows left to hide in."
 g_the_masters_of_serpentreach_title:0 "Masters of Serpentreach"
 g_the_masters_of_serpentreach_desc:0 "Finally, we have removed the last of the Blackbeard Cartel’s influence in the Serpentreach, captured the old remnant holds, and spread our control from Gor Bûrad to Orlghelovar. The Thieving Arrow clan is no more, for from now on we are the only ones left, the Usmaklan."
 g_wandering_into_woods_title:0 "Wander Into Woods"
 g_wandering_into_woods_desc:0 "With our hold on the Serpentreach solidifying, perhaps it is time to go beyond the ruined Wardgate and venture into the Deepwoods. Though surely with such an impressive, albeit completely ruined and useless, gate to guard the entrance, there will be great dangers out there as well.  We must be prepared."
 g_market_sap_untapped_title:0 "Market Sap Untapped"
 g_market_sap_untapped_desc:0 "There is so much to be exploited in the Deepwoods, from the sap in the trees to the fur of the beasts that live beneath them. And of course, the trees themselves.\n\nYes, this was a fine plan. The wheels of our industry will never stop turning now."
 g_a_link_to_further_conquest_title:0 "A Link To The Future"
 g_a_link_to_further_conquest_desc:0 "We have found some old records and journals from the dwarves that once called Verkal Skomdihr home, detailing methods of survival, travel, and precaution when traversing the Deepwoods. Although many were lost, our scouts have finally been able to start working out how to navigate the paths between the major regions of the forest. Nothing stands in our way now."
 g_deeper_into_the_deepwoods_title:0 "Deeper into the Deepwoods"
 g_deeper_into_the_deepwoods_desc:0 "Though there were a few scattered goblin clans and orcish tribes within the Deepwoods, we have become the dominant goblin presence here. The elves that remain will soon be no threat to us as our manufactories pump out arms and armour, fueled by a steady supply of Deepwoods wood and Serpentreach metal."

A valuable commodity to trade with other goblin tribes, it has become even more valued in modern times by those goblins who spend their time making strange art or devices.

 cavegoblinflavor.7.b:0 "Diplomacy with goblins? Inconceivable!"
 
 cavegoblinflavor.8.t:0 "Our Offer Rejected"
 cavegoblinflavor.8.d:0 "Either they are fools who cannot understand the benefit of tactical diplomacy, or they are wise and they understand the problems of tactical diplomacy.  Either way, they have refused our offer of a truce."
