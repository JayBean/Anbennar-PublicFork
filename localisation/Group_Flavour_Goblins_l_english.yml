 cave_goblin_expanding_our_influence_title:0 "Expand Our Influence"

 g_integrating_new_nezkaru_desc:0 "As we absorb more of the scattered nezkaru, it is important we integrate these new families into our society.

 g_absorbing_the_disorganized_nezkaru_desc:0 "The Dwarovar was once filled with orcish hordes and warbands roaming the caverns and tunnels, enslaving, killing, and plundering from any goblin they happened upon. Now that the orcs have left with Dookanson's invasion of the surface, the Dwarovar is mostly goblins. We should absorb these disorganized bands of goblins. Our ability to integrate the teeming masses of goblinkind that dwell in the Dwarovar will surely be to our advantage. And we will need every advantage if Dookanson's victorious army returns."

 g_looted_secrets_title:0 "Looted Secrets"
 g_looted_secrets_desc:0 "Dwarves are a clever lot, building all sort o' defenses to keep our kind out. But back in them days they had big empires and palaces and lots and lots of money - so maybe there's something we can learn from these beardy boys after all?"
 g_loot_plunder_title:0 "Loot and Plunder"

 g_conquest_of_a_hold_title:0 "Conquer a Hold"
 g_conquest_of_a_hold_desc:0 "The dwarves have always held their holds as bastions of civilization in the deep, dark tunnels of the Dwarovar - and we have always been envious of them for it. Some of our kind have already swarmed their one mighty holds and settled it for themselves, and now we must do the same!"
 g_our_hold_title:0 "Our Hold"
 g_our_hold_desc:0 "As our people find new corners of the hold to settle, we must be certain that this hold belongs to us and only us, and any would-be leftover be dealt with appropriately!"
 g_a_vault_for_our_plunder_title:0 "A Vault for Our Plunder"
 g_a_vault_for_our_plunder_desc:0 "A proper goblin clan needs a vault. A big, roomy vault."
 g_centralizing_the_clan_title:0 "Squatter's Rights"
 g_centralizing_the_clan_desc:0 "Gone are the days of living in darkness, freezin' our butts off in dank caverns! The dwarven halls now fill with goblinoids hoping for a new life in safer homes. But with this, we must adapt. Our clanbosses must be stronger than ever, to protect our new home and to prevent any upstart little runt from taking our hold for themself!"
 g_settling_down_title:0 "Settling Down"
 g_settling_down_desc:0 "As our people build on top of the ruins of the old dwarven hold our way of rule too must evolve. We ain't no random goblin lurking in the tunnels no more, but a proper settled clan!"
 g_battles_with_the_dwarves_title:0 "Battles With the Dwarves"
 g_battles_with_the_dwarves_desc:0 "Goblins and dwarves have been enemies since the dawn of both races in the Serpentspine. Throughout that time we have seen each others' greatest accomplishments, and each others' lowest of lows.\n\nWe must capitalize on the weakness of the dwarves and crash upon them with never-ending ferocity, to honor the legacy of our ancestors who brought their empire to its knees, and finish the job they started."
 g_learning_from_our_battles_title:0 "Learning From Our Battles"
 g_learning_from_our_battles_desc:0 "The dwarves are a conniving race of ugly mugs with weapons that we admit are quite formidable. The tactics of our ancestors were a simple kind: rush in and stab enough dwarves to make a difference.\n\nOur numbers would always win the day then, but now times are harsher, the world is changing, and so should we. The dwarves may think themselves clever, but they've nothing on the wicked mind of our goblin tacticians!"
 g_the_most_feared_warriors_in_the_dwarovar_title:0 "The Most Feared Warriors"
 g_the_most_feared_warriors_in_the_dwarovar_desc:0 "Tales of our goblin might have spread all throughout the Serpentspine and beyond! Adventurers cower at the sight of unmarked crates in the tunneling depths, steer clear of suspiciously placed stones, and run in fear at the sight of abandoned settlements in case of ambushes from beneath the earth. We have engineered the Serpentspine into our playground, and one would be a fool to oppose us now."
 
 # Spiderwretch Missions
 g_a_clan_in_the_spiderdens_title:0 "A Clan in the Spiderdens"
 g_a_clan_in_the_spiderdens_desc:0 "The Spiderdens are a collection of caves and crevices named for the obscene amount of spiders that populate and call it home. The dangers of these caves is apparent immediately, with one only having to glance up briefly to see massive webs stretching through miles of still cave air, and those are only the ones visible to the darklight eye.\n\nEven here, in this seemingly neverending pit of predators and their hapless victims, we goblins have found a way to thrive, learning to live in a tenuous harmony with the spiders - wild and domesticated alike, creating a society suspended on their iron-hard webs."
 g_perfecting_venombrew_title:0 "Perfect Venombrew"
 g_perfecting_venombrew_desc:0 "Where a dwarf has his favorite ale, a goblin has his favorite stimulant.\n\nVenombrew began its history as a common tincture used by goblins and extracted from the fangs of the spiders that live amongst them. Spider venom has a variety of effects depending on the species, but the kind that are dominant within the Spiderdens were known for producing a type of venom with a curious, hallucinogenic side-effect. Goblins of the Spiderdens have always been known for ingesting the substance pure to whip themselves into painless furies for raids, but our clan has come up with a recipe for turning it into a sweet drink and a damn good time."
 g_all_encompassing_ruler_title:0 "All Encompassing Ruler"
 g_all_encompassing_ruler_desc:0 "The ruler of a goblin clan often has somewhat loose control over their subjects, as ruling over a race as unruly as the goblins is a task that comes difficult, even to goblins themselves. However, the dwellers of the Spiderdens have always done things a little differently.\n\nRuling from thrones of iron-hard web, often commandeered by our strongest warriors from absolutely massive broodmothers, our rulers have reigned with a surprising degree of control - as is necessary in a land where one wrong move can often mean the doom of the whole clan.\n\nIt is said that from these thrones of web they can sense even minor disturbances in their territories from the vibrations made through the ever-expanding weave."
 g_uniting_the_spiderlands_title:0 "Uniting the Spiderlands"
 g_uniting_the_spiderlands_desc:0 "The Spiderdens have long been a hotbed of conflict between both rival clans of goblins and spider families vying for domination over territory. Now, united under our tattered banner, we have come to rule over this land of predators and their cruel machinations.\n\nWith the thrones of the crushed clans embedded into our boss's own grand throne, and their trusted spider steeds consumed by the boss's personal broodmother, we now rule uncontested over the fangs and webs necessary to ensnare the rest of the Serpentspine."
 g_the_clan_on_spiderback_title:0 "A Clan on Spiderback"
 g_the_clan_on_spiderback_desc:0 "The sight of the massive webs and spiders infesting the open air of the Spiderdens has long been a source of fear for its denizens, with poets from the age of the dwarves describing our lands as wild and brutal, to be avoided and prepared for when necessity comes to enter them. Unfortunately for them, our clanboss has decided that the scope of these dens is insufficiently small for the grand imagination of our peoples.\n\nSoon the entire Serpentspine will bear witness to our empire, with the Spiderdens serving as the beating heart for a new Dwarovar of silk and spiders."
 
 # Thieving Arrows Missions
 g_a_clan_embattled_title:0 "A Clan Embattled"
 g_a_clan_embattled_desc:0 "There are many would be contenders for goblin supremacy in the Serpentreach and we have been fighting them all for a long time. Our armies are becoming used to these fights and the more we win the more we learn. We have begun to use these lessons to defeat our rivals and our armies are coming out further and further on top."
 g_a_skomdihr_way_we_go_title:0 "Skomdihr Way We Go"
 g_a_skomdihr_way_we_go_desc:0 "We have come to realize that, if we are to solidify our hold on the Serpentreach, we’ll need a hold to solidify. The nearby hold of Verkal Skomdihr should do nicely, once we get it fixed up of course."
 g_between_a_garnet_and_a_diamond_hard_place_title:0 "Garnet and Diamond"
 g_between_a_garnet_and_a_diamond_hard_place_desc:0 "Now that we’ve secured and fixed up our new hold, we’ve been able to organize scouting parties to map out the Serpentreach. There seem to be several dwarven threats building up from the old holds of Ovdal Lodhum and Arg-Ôrdstun, putting us in a very dangerous situation. If we are to maintain this small hold we’ve carved out for ourselves, we’ll need them out of the way."
 g_hunting_blackbeard_title:0 "Hunting Blackbeard"
 g_hunting_blackbeard_desc:0 "While the other holds were a military threat to our new domain, the Blackbeard Cartel is something different altogether. Being a criminal organization long before they came back to the Dwarovar, they are used to operating from the shadows and maintaining a hold where they have no business doing so. While we may have dealt with them militarily, they will remain an unseen thorn in our side, undercutting our merchants and punishing our own cartels’ control until we have removed all dwarves from the Serpentreach.  Only then will they have no shadows left to hide in."
 g_the_masters_of_serpentreach_title:0 "Masters of Serpentreach"
 g_the_masters_of_serpentreach_desc:0 "Finally, we have removed the last of the Blackbeard Cartel’s influence in the Serpentreach, captured the old remnant holds, and spread our control from Gor Bûrad to Orlghelovar. The Thieving Arrow clan is no more, for from now on we are the only ones left, the Usmaklan."
 g_wandering_into_woods_title:0 "Wander Into Woods"
 g_wandering_into_woods_desc:0 "With our hold on the Serpentreach solidifying, perhaps it is time to go beyond the ruined Wardgate and venture into the Deepwoods. Though surely with such an impressive, albeit completely ruined and useless, gate to guard the entrance, there will be great dangers out there as well.  We must be prepared."
 g_market_sap_untapped_title:0 "Market Sap Untapped"
 g_market_sap_untapped_desc:0 "There is so much to be exploited in the Deepwoods, from the sap in the trees to the fur of the beasts that live beneath them. And of course, the trees themselves.\n\nYes, this was a fine plan. The wheels of our industry will never stop turning now."
 g_a_link_to_further_conquest_title:0 "A Link To The Future"
 g_a_link_to_further_conquest_desc:0 "We have found some old records and journals from the dwarves that once called Verkal Skomdihr home, detailing methods of survival, travel, and precaution when traversing the Deepwoods. Although many were lost, our scouts have finally been able to start working out how to navigate the paths between the major regions of the forest. Nothing stands in our way now."
 g_deeper_into_the_deepwoods_title:0 "Deeper into the Deepwoods"
 g_deeper_into_the_deepwoods_desc:0 "Though there were a few scattered goblin clans and orcish tribes within the Deepwoods, we have become the dominant goblin presence here. The elves that remain will soon be no threat to us as our manufactories pump out arms and armour, fueled by a steady supply of Deepwoods wood and Serpentreach metal."
 
 # Undergrowth Missions
 dens_the_settling_of_grozumdihr_title:0 "The Settling of Grôzumdihr"
 dens_the_settling_of_grozumdihr_desc:0 "When we came to Grôzumdihr, it was a patchwork wreck filled with squatting feral goblins. Now it's a patchwork masterpiece filled with squatting civilized goblins."
 dens_speaking_to_the_outside_world_title:0 "The Outside World"
 dens_speaking_to_the_outside_world_desc:0 "The people of the land called Rahen are a strange sort. Living their lives in a giant cavern filled with bright light, no doubt from some sort of luminescent mold on the roof. Odd as they may be, they'll trade with us and even sometimes fight for us. That makes it worth trying to talk to their clanbosses."
 dens_speaking_to_the_outside_world_tooltip:0 "We are §Ydemonsterizing§!"
 dens_uniting_the_three_clans_title:0 "Unite the Three Clans"
 dens_uniting_the_three_clans_desc:0 "The three clans of Dirtwater, Poisoned Rock, and Ambersniffer have existed in a delicate balance of power for many years, with no one clan able to achieve dominance over another. The weakening of the already weak orc presence in the Tree of Stone has presented an opportunity to bring more of our troops to bear in order to settle this dispute. Let us bring our rivals under our leadership."
 dens_unite_clans_tooltip:0 "Have contact with the two other clans in the Tree of Stone"
 dens_improving_the_clan_dens_title:0 "Improve the Clan Dens"
 dens_improving_the_clan_dens_desc:0 "While our warbands are somewhat migratory, there are areas of the Undergrowth Dens that owe some sort of permanent allegiance to one of the three clans of the Tree of Stone. These will make good starting places for building up our control of the region."
 dens_building_new_hovels_title:0 "Build New Hovels"
 dens_building_new_hovels_desc:0 "One of the problems with controlling the Undergrowth Dens is that many of the goblins living there are wanderers. Constructing housing for them, and providing some proper encouragement to live in it should make the place easier to control."
 dens_mastery_of_the_dens_title:0 "Mastery of the Dens"
 dens_mastery_of_the_dens_desc:0 "With the amount of infrastructure we have constructed in the Undergrowth Dens, it is difficult to point to a part that we don't control. We are truly the masters of this place."
 dens_resettling_the_masses_title:0 "Resettle the Masses"
 dens_resettling_the_masses_desc:0 "We have a lot of extra goblins sitting around in slums. Moving them to more accessible areas will let us tax them more. Er, I mean to say that it will let us provide them with essential social services. Like being conscripted into the army. Or being taxed."
 dens_tracking_dwarven_raiders_title:0 "Track Dwarven Raiders"
 dens_tracking_dwarven_raiders_desc:0 "Our scouts have followed a dwarf raiding party back to their source. The hold of Ovdal Kanzad. It seems that they have decided to take a preemptive stance towards our presence as we both expand. Well, four can play at that game."
 dens_ovdal_kanzad_war_title:0 "War On Ovdal Kanzad"
 dens_ovdal_kanzad_war_desc:0 "The more we delay the stronger the dwarves will become. They'll keep building their boom carriages unless we stop them. We must strike them now if we are to survive!"
 dens_conquest_of_ovdal_kanzad_title:0 "Conquer Ovdal Kanzad"
 dens_conquest_of_ovdal_kanzad_desc:0 "Ovdal Kanzad lies in our hands. No longer will we fear dwarven raiders come to burn down our villages and raiding outposts. No longer will we turn pink with envy at the sight of their boom carriages. Today is a great day for our clan."
 dens_settling_in_title:0 "Settling In"
 dens_settling_in_desc:0 "Have you been to Ovdal Kanzad? It's pretty nice there. They've got a bunch of explosives. We can use that to get rid of the dwarves. It'll be great fun."
 dens_the_way_forward_title:0 "The Way Forward"
 dens_the_way_forward_desc:0 "The full depths of the Undergrowth Dens sit under our control. The Holds of Grôzumdihr, Ovdal Kanzad, and Ovdal-az-Ân have been pried from enemy hands. We have become stronger than all challengers. Stronger than all rivals. Though threats remain, we have proven the three clans is better than one. Especially under our leadership. Let us call ourselves a name worthy of three clans united. Udzen Troice, All Three."
 dens_there_can_only_be_one_title:0 "There Can Only Be One!"
 dens_there_can_only_be_one_desc:0 "The Tree of Stone isn't big enough for two goblin powers. Chaingrasper or us. One has to go. And we'd rather it not be us."
 dens_subduing_chaingrasper_title:0 "Subdue Chaingrasper"
 dens_subduing_chaingrasper_desc:0 "The strict society created by Dak Chaingrasper and upheld by his sycophantic heirs and admirers is at complete odds with our own. This has proven to be its undoing. Free goblins will always triumph over those who are less free. Even if they say they are free. Or we said they were free that one time. Ahem. Our victory now means that we have no rivals within the Tree of Stone. But also no friends. The times ahead could prove dangerous. SO let us celebrate now, that we might celebrate sometime tomorrow."
 dens_from_the_caverns_to_the_holds_title:0 "Caverns to Holds"
 dens_from_the_caverns_to_the_holds_desc:0 "As holds become of greater importance to use, it comes time to rethink the way that our government operates. Becoming more sedentary will help with administering our changing dominion."
 dens_controlling_the_dens_title:0 "Control the Dens"
 dens_controlling_the_dens_desc:0 "The Undergrowth Dens is the name given to the twisting tunnels and caverns that lie in the roots of the Tree of Stone. Extremely overpopulated with goblins, none of the clans in the area has ever been able to establish a firm control and harness this mass of goblins. So far prevented by the need to deal with rivals. Now that we we have united the three major clans in the Undergrowth Dens, we can turn our effort to bringing these regions under our control, although the nature of the various caverns and tunnel networks means that we cannot yet harness their full potential."

 cavegoblinflavor.11.d:0 "Oh mighty and most splendid clanboss. Our rivals in the Ambersniffer clan have sent an envoy begging peace in our current spat.
