Now that the orcs have left with Dookanson's invasion of the surface, the Dwarovar is mostly goblins. We should absorb these disorganized bands of goblins. Our ability to integrate the teeming masses of goblinkind that dwell in the Dwarovar will surely be to our advantage. And we will need every advantage if Dookanson's victorious army returns."

 g_looted_secrets_desc:0 "Dwarves are a clever lot, building all sort o' defenses to keep our kind out. But back in them days they had big empires and palaces and lots and lots of money - so maybe there's something we can learn from these beardy boys after all?"

 g_conquest_of_a_hold_title:0 "Conquer a Hold"
 g_conquest_of_a_hold_desc:0 "The dwarves have always held their holds as bastions of civilization in the deep, dark tunnels of the Dwarovar - and we have always been envious of them for it.

 g_centralizing_the_clan_title:0 "Squatter's Rights"

 g_battles_with_the_dwarves_desc:0 "Goblins and dwarves have been enemies since the dawn of both races in the Serpentspine. Throughout that time we have seen each others' greatest accomplishments, and each others' lowest of lows.\n\nWe must capitalize on the weakness of the dwarves and crash upon them with never-ending ferocity, to honor the legacy of our ancestors who brought their empire to its knees, and finish the job they started."
 g_learning_from_our_battles_title:0 "Learning From Our Battles"
 g_learning_from_our_battles_desc:0 "The dwarves are a conniving race of ugly mugs with weapons that we admit are quite formidable. The tactics of our ancestors were a simple kind: rush in and stab enough dwarves to make a difference.\n\nOur numbers would always win the day then, but now times are harsher, the world is changing, and so should we. The dwarves may think themselves clever, but they've nothing on the wicked mind of our goblin tacticians!"

 g_the_most_feared_warriors_in_the_dwarovar_desc:0 "Tales of our goblin might have spread all throughout the Serpentspine and beyond! Adventurers cower at the sight of unmarked crates in the tunneling depths, steer clear of suspiciously placed stones, and run in fear at the sight of abandoned settlements in case of ambushes from beneath the earth. We have engineered the Serpentspine into our playground, and one would be a fool to oppose us now."
 
 
 # Thieving Arrows Missions
 g_a_clan_embattled_title:0 "A Clan Embattled"
 g_a_clan_embattled_desc:0 "There are many would be contenders for goblin supremacy in the Serpentreach and we have been fighting them all for a long time. Our armies are becoming used to these fights and the more we win the more we learn. We have begun to use these lessons to defeat our rivals and our armies are coming out further and further on top."
 g_a_skomdihr_way_we_go_title:0 "Skomdihr Way We Go"
 g_a_skomdihr_way_we_go_desc:0 "We have come to realize that, if we are to solidify our hold on the Serpentreach, we’ll need a hold to solidify. The nearby hold of Verkal Skomdihr should do nicely, once we get it fixed up of course."
 g_between_a_garnet_and_a_diamond_hard_place_title:0 "Garnet and Diamond"
 g_between_a_garnet_and_a_diamond_hard_place_desc:0 "Now that we’ve secured and fixed up our new hold, we’ve been able to organize scouting parties to map out the Serpentreach. There seem to be several dwarven threats building up from the old holds of Ovdal Lodhum and Arg-Ôrdstun, putting us in a very dangerous situation. If we are to maintain this small hold we’ve carved out for ourselves, we’ll need them out of the way."
 g_hunting_blackbeard_title:0 "Hunting Blackbeard"
 g_hunting_blackbeard_desc:0 "While the other holds were a military threat to our new domain, the Blackbeard Cartel is something different altogether. Being a criminal organization long before they came back to the Dwarovar, they are used to operating from the shadows and maintaining a hold where they have no business doing so. While we may have dealt with them militarily, they will remain an unseen thorn in our side, undercutting our merchants and punishing our own cartels’ control until we have removed all dwarves from the Serpentreach.  Only then will they have no shadows left to hide in."
 g_the_masters_of_serpentreach_title:0 "Masters of Serpentreach"
 g_the_masters_of_serpentreach_desc:0 "Finally, we have removed the last of the Blackbeard Cartel’s influence in the Serpentreach, captured the old remnant holds, and spread our control from Gor Bûrad to Orlghelovar. The Thieving Arrow clan is no more, for from now on we are the only ones left, the Usmaklan."
 g_wandering_into_woods_title:0 "Wander Into Woods"
 g_wandering_into_woods_desc:0 "With our hold on the Serpentreach solidifying, perhaps it is time to go beyond the ruined Wardgate and venture into the Deepwoods. Though surely with such an impressive, albeit completely ruined and useless, gate to guard the entrance, there will be great dangers out there as well.  We must be prepared."
 g_market_sap_untapped_title:0 "Market Sap Untapped"
 g_market_sap_untapped_desc:0 "There is so much to be exploited in the Deepwoods, from the sap in the trees to the fur of the beasts that live beneath them. And of course, the trees themselves.\n\nYes, this was a fine plan. The wheels of our industry will never stop turning now."
 g_a_link_to_further_conquest_title:0 "A Link To The Future"
 g_a_link_to_further_conquest_desc:0 "We have found some old records and journals from the dwarves that once called Verkal Skomdihr home, detailing methods of survival, travel, and precaution when traversing the Deepwoods. Although many were lost, our scouts have finally been able to start working out how to navigate the paths between the major regions of the forest. Nothing stands in our way now."
 g_deeper_into_the_deepwoods_title:0 "Deeper into the Deepwoods"
 g_deeper_into_the_deepwoods_desc:0 "Though there were a few scattered goblin clans and orcish tribes within the Deepwoods, we have become the dominant goblin presence here. The elves that remain will soon be no threat to us as our manufactories pump out arms and armour, fueled by a steady supply of Deepwoods wood and Serpentreach metal."

 mountainshark_lowers_your_migration_cooldown_by_25_tooltip:0 "Lowers your migration cooldown by 20%"
 
 this_will_loot_all_our_noncap_holds_tooltip:0 "We will extract plunder from the depths of all of our non-capital holds. This will devastate them, but boost our treasury."
 this_will_loot_all_our_noncap_holds_tooltip_2:0 "We will extract plunder from the depths of all of our non-capital holds. This will devastate them and reduce their development, but boost our monarch power."
