 duwarkani_the_shadows_whisper_title:0 "The Shadows Whisper"
 duwarkani_the_shadows_whisper_desc:0 "There is a whisper in the air. Something evil lurks in the swamp. Something that has lay dormant for centuries is stirring and searching for allies, victims, or both. They send out their emissaries, hunting for those in desperate circumstances and promise them an easy solution, if only they submit to their power. For the Irsmahapan refugees of Mattabo, hounded from their homes, these voices must tempt them. Dam the shadows. Bring them into Nirakhet’s embrace before the shadows reach them first."
 duwarkani_save_the_echenka_title:0 "Save the Echenka"
 duwarkani_save_the_echenka_desc:0 "The Echenka have slowly seen their lands be swallowed by the Shadow Swamp. In this environment, it’s no wonder many started worshipping the beings of shadow - although worship is not the correct word. Fear would be more accurate. Under Duwarkani, there will be no fear. We are their protectors, for now and for always."
 duwarkani_convert_the_gnolls_title:0 "Convert the Gnolls"
 duwarkani_convert_the_gnolls_desc:0 "Gnolls and humans have been fighting over the Sorrow for as long as Kheterata has existed. Ever since the First Xhazobine slew Elikhet, since Castan Beastbane turned the gnolls of the Sorrow into fur pelts, since Grizaka shattered the great empire. So many lives have been lost in this constant back and forth.\n\nCastan Beastbane believed the source of this evil was a mythical site called the Pit of Grilax. But the true evil is the Xhazobkult, a faith that drives its followers to commit mass sacrifices in the name of demonic power. Every sacrifice’s soul is embraced by Nirakhet on the other side, but what of the gnolls themselves? Does Mother Nirakhet not also weep for the gnolls? If they are welcomed into the arms of Nirakhetism, could their souls too be saved?"
 duwarkani_rebuild_the_ahati_title:0 "Rebuild the Ahati"
 duwarkani_rebuild_the_ahati_desc:0 "The Ahati are a vast network of merchants, nobles and soldiers who serve the Steward of the Sorrow. It was first created by the original King Menkaunswt and has served the people of Kheterata ever since. Yet in that time their loyalties have become more and more detached from the crown itself. Admission to the Ahati has become increasingly insular and restrictive, not allowing any of the so-called "monstrous" races to join. It is as though they have forgotten what King Menkaunswt originally built his armies with. It was he who first admitted harpies into the armies of Kheterata. We can rebuild the Ahati to be more welcoming to all. It will just take some time."
 duwarkani_trolls_in_the_ahati_title:0 "Trolls in the Ahati"
 duwarkani_trolls_in_the_ahati_desc:0 "Mother Nirakhet weeps for all, but even the most devout believers in Nirakhetism found it hard to sympathise with the trolls of Yezel Mora. For centuries they ravaged the lands of Sarhal, plunging regions into despair. We now know their actions were being guided by the Night Hags. They are victims of their evil, and each one that died as they were sent to destroy Sarhal were wept for as much as anyone else was. Even knowing this, the trolls have struggled to find a place in our society. Some have even suggested that they should be driven from our nation entirely. Centuries of living under the guidance of the Night Hags mean they are not capable of assimilating into modern society. Is there even a place for trolls in our nation?\n\nYes, there is! The most unlikely of places too. Members of the Ahati Brotherhood have increasingly been hiring trolls as bodyguards, personal retainers, and even soldiers to fight alongside them in battle. The trolls themselves meanwhile have found a place where their strength is valued, where they can gain respectability, and where they can send their wages back to their families who still live in the Shadow Swamp. We need to encourage this, as already dissenting voices have emerged that insist trolls joining the Ahati should be illegal."
 duwarkani_the_shadow_trolls_guide_title:0 "The Shadow Troll Guide"
 duwarkani_the_shadow_trolls_guide_desc:0 "One mystery still hangs over our nation. The idea that all monsters came from another plane to terrorize the civilised peoples. Despite a lack of evidence of the literal Pit of Grilax, the remaining defenders of Beastbane claim the portal to the Shadow Plane is the metaphorical Pit of Grilax. They use the swamp trolls as evidence as the latest beasts to emerge from the shadow plane. The Castanorian legion may not know of any origin of beasts, but that does not mean we can’t continue our search in the Shadow Plane for any evidence of the swamp troll birthplace."
 duwarkani_feathers_of_maat_title:0 "Feathers of Ma'at"
 duwarkani_feathers_of_maat_desc:0 "Nzeri harpies have been fighting alongside the forces of Kheterata ever since King Menkaunswt brought the Kingdom of Munzeri into their fold. From the wars with the Damerian Republic, Aakhet’s Dragon Wars for Bulwar, the Cattle Wars with the Second Fangaula Empire, and most recently in the war against the gnolls for control of the Sorrow. One such regiment, the Feathers of Ma’at, fought Grizaka herself at the siege of Golkora.\n\nUltimately Grizaka and hordes of Gnollakaz were victorious, shattering Kheterata and leaving them directionless. If we are to retake the Mother’s Sorrow from the gnolls, we will have to convince these wayward soldiers to fight for us."
 duwarkani_protect_samsumbat_title:0 "Protect Samsumbat"
 duwarkani_protect_samsumbat_desc:0 "Nirakhetism is the religion of the masses, the underclass, and the downtrodden in society. The slaves of Samsumbat prayed to Nirakhet for their salvation, and she delivered. Yet their position is delicate. Without someone to protect their fledgling nation, they will fall. Installing new leadership there, a friend loyal to the Menkaunswt dynasty, will bring their people under our protection. They will never again fear the harsh chains of slavery, for Mother Nirakhet protects all her children."
 duwarkani_tijarikheti_under_nirakhet_title:0 "Tijarikheti under Nirakhet"
 duwarkani_tijarikheti_under_nirakhet_desc:0 ""When Kheterata shattered, the Tijarikhet people could have united under the noble blood of King Menkaunswt. Instead it too proceeded to shatter even further into revolts, mages, and dragon worship. Thousands upon thousands of lives were lost in this petty struggle for control of the mountains. Why must they fight when we know all are safe under Nirakhet? Under the wings of the Nzeri Harpies, bring Nirakhetism to all corners of Khetapera."
 duwarkani_by_feather_and_camel_title:0 "By Feather and Camel"
 duwarkani_by_feather_and_camel_desc:0 "Harpies and cavalry do not go together. The camel brigades that have historically allowed Kheterata to control both the southern Divenhal and the Gol plains have struggled to find a place in the new Nzeri Harpy armies, and the nobles who derive a big part of their prestige from their ability to ride a camel into battle have grown restless at their lack of place in the military.\n\nThe two sides can work together though. The problem with a mixed harpy and human army has historically been the inability for humans to keep up with their harpy comrades on foot. But on camels the two sides could fight side by side. Assign each camelry brigade a harpy standard bearer. She can lead them into battle, direct them from above, and coordinate with the rest of our forces so the full might of our army can strike our enemies in a single, blistering assault."
 duwarkani_a_late_wedding_celebration_title:0 "A Late Wedding"
 duwarkani_a_late_wedding_celebration_desc:0 "As Kheterata shattered in 1439, it left the Tijarikheti people in a panic. Xhazobkultist hordes stood at their doorstep and it was feared the entire mountainous region of Khetapera would fall. The fortress of Duwarkani was the single most strategically important location in the entire region, holding back invasions from gnolls, lizardfolk, and whatever it was that lurked deep in the Shadow Swamp. King Kenmu Menkaunswt knew the location could not hold out without allies, so he struck out and made the most unlikely partnership of them all: a royal marriage with Queen Safana Duwaran of the harpy queendom of Munzeri.\n\nAlthough everyone recognised it was merely a diplomatic affair to join the two crowns as one, this does not mean a marriage of the two crowns should not be celebrated. Yet in our haste to organise a defence of our new realm, an official ceremony was never held. With the initial fear waylaid, it’s time to finally hold the wedding and join together the families of Menkaunswt and Duwaran."
 duwarkani_birth_of_the_sorrow_title:0 "Birth of the Sorrow"
 duwarkani_birth_of_the_sorrow_desc:0 "Lake Nirakhet was the birthplace of Kheterata. It is here where Mother Nirakhet wept for her son Elikhet as he abandoned his divinity to save the people of Kheterata from genie subjugation. Her tears flowed to create the Mother’s Sorrow, from whose banks the great civilisation prospered. Under the Crodamic dynasty, this most holy of lakes was left under-developed as later kings grew complacent.\n\nThe Crodamic dynasty has failed Kheterata. It is time to restore the blood of Kheterata’s finest ever ruler to Steward of the Sorrow. A Menkaunswt will sit atop the throne in Kheterat once again, and it is from here at Lake Nirakhet that our quest begins."
 duwarkani_paladins_of_the_sorrow_title:0 "Paladins of the Sorrow"
 duwarkani_paladins_of_the_sorrow_desc:0 "A dangerous rumour has been spreading across the Kheteratan humans. They say Kheterata will soon be back under monstrous rule, as it was when the First Xhazobine took the Mother’s Sorrow, except instead of gnolls it will be harpies that sit atop the throne. The shared duties of human king and harpy queen does little to quench their fear, for it is the Nzeri Harpy soldiers that they fear the most.\n\nForce will not convince them otherwise. It would only prove their fears to be true. Protectors do not plunge a spear into those they claim to protect. Stand down every soldier in our army. Let them march on the capital. We will not harm a single person who seeks an audience with the royal couple. Only then will they understand that we are not your subjugators, but your protectors."
 duwarkani_a_menkaunswt_steward_title:0 "A Menkaunswt Steward"
 duwarkani_a_menkaunswt_steward_desc:0 "It has been over 1500 years since a Menakunswt last held the title of Steward of the Sorrow. It’s time to correct that. The current Menkaunswt dynasty may have wings now, but the same blood of the Warrior King flows through our Queen’s veins. The Sorrow will be reborn under our Stewardship once again!"
 duwarkani_delta_gnome_lapidaries_title:0 "Delta Gnome Lapidaries"
 duwarkani_delta_gnome_lapidaries_desc:0 "The Delta Gnomes that live at the mouth of the Mother’s Sorrow are a product of an ancient friendship between Kheterata and the Gnomish Hierarchy. It was King Menkaunswt who first saw the potential in their tinkering with magical artefacts. He ordered them to craft the finest gems for our war mages to use in his conquest of Akasik and Khetapera, as well as his victory over Castanor. Many of the lapidaries that cut the old gems still maintain the family business, and have powerful guilds in Koroshesh that oversee their work.\n\nThe head of the Lapidaries Guild has shown us the latest creation of the Delta Gnomes: A new gemstone that can be infused with magical power and placed at the breech of a cannon to enhance its power. The only issue is that the current prototype is unstable, and has caused multiple workshops across Koroshesh to explode. They are asking for new workshops to be constructed, as well as help from the mages in Muhaqaar, to perfect their new magical invention."
 duwarkani_children_of_nirakhet_title:0 "Children of Nirakhet"
 duwarkani_children_of_nirakhet_desc:0 "When a hero slays a monster, nobody sheds a tear for the monster. Instead they just cheer as the beast is slain. This was how Kheterata viewed gnolls, lizardfolk, and even harpies for centuries. Back when Castan Beastbane liberated Kheterata from gnollish rule, he introduced the concept of "monstrous” races to the region. We reject these ideas. We are all children of Nirakhet. From her eyes pour the tears for every sentient being who eventually leaves this plane, for all are worthy of being mourned. Mother Nirakhet weeps for all."
 duwarkani_his_trail_located_title:0 "His Trail Located"
 duwarkani_his_trail_located_desc:0 "We found a clue! From the clues laid out in the papers collected in the Library of Koroshesh, we know where Beastbane’s Legion went to find the supposed location of the Pits of Grilax. In Gazrak lies an ancient genie construction where supposedly the portal to the plane of demons was opened and all monstrous people emerged. The idea is clearly fanciful, but if we can find the location of where his legion died, perhaps it will end the instability, and we can end this hateful theory that all monsters come from some mythical dimension of demons."
 duwarkani_destroy_the_hags_control_title:0 "Destroy the Hag's Control"
 duwarkani_destroy_the_hags_control_desc:0 "Castan Beastbane may have been wrong about the Pits of Grilax, but he did inadvertently lead us to the answer on how to end the spread of the Shadow Swamp’s curse. At its centre stands a great world tree from which a connection to the shadow plane is formed. The Night Hags have somehow manipulated this tree to release the shadows from the plane of death to our own plane. If we can slay free the world tree from the hag’s control, its draining effects on the swamp could be cleansed."
 duwarkani_even_for_you_title:0 "Even For You"
 duwarkani_even_for_you_desc:0 "How many have we sent to the shadow plane? Not through the portal, but through our spears, our canons, our talons and claws? How many would we have to kill so that Mother Nirakhet would no longer mourn our passing? Does she truly weep for all?"
 duwarkani_a_winged_menkaunswt_title:0 "A Winged Menkaunswt"
 duwarkani_a_winged_menkaunswt_desc:0 "King Menkaunswt, the Warrior King. One of the finest rulers ever to sit atop the throne of Kheterata, second only to Elikhet himself. It was he who swooped in and took the throne when the previous king was ready to sell the soul of the nation out to the distant kings of Castanor, ensuring Kheterata would stand proud as the finest empire on the Divenhal.\n\nYet the Menkaunswt dynasty has grown sparse and thin. The family was ostracised under Crodamic Kheterata. King Sedoric recognised that he could not oust such an influential family from power, but he could effectively banish them by "gifting” the head of the family the position of Steward of Duwarkani. An important position, but also one distant from the Sorrow itself, too far to influence the politics of ruling Kheterata.\n\nOver the years, the Menkaunswt dynasty slowly died out, until only King Kenmu could claim to follow that bloodline. But through his daughter the dynasty still lives on. It may have feathers now, but make no mistake. As the blood of the Warrior King still flows through her veins, it now too powers her wings."
 duwarkani_the_holy_site_of_duwarkani_title:0 "The Holy Site of Duwarkani"
 duwarkani_the_holy_site_of_duwarkani_desc:0 "The sight of a Nzeri Harpy soaring over the battlefield has become a holy symbol for the Duwarkani soldiers. It is they who rally the troops and direct proceedings, their brightly coloured talismans adorning their armour becoming symbols associated with faith in both Nirakhetism and Duwarkani itself. More and more citizens have been travelling to the site of King Kenmu Menkaunswt and Queen Safana Duwaran’s wedding in Duwarkani itself as a sort of pilgrimage, especially other Nzeri Harpies, often to pray for the safety of their family in war. We should do more to accommodate them. Duwarkani’s position as a fortress has grown less important over time, while its religious significance continues to grow."
 duwarkani_decree_on_magic_title:0 "Decree on Magic"
 duwarkani_decree_on_magic_desc:0 "Elikhet’s Decree on Magic is one of the most fervently debated tenants of khetism, and one so wildly misinterpreted by the nobility that Elikhet himself rose from his tomb to correct their misuse of it. Magic should be used by those granted its power to protect the people, not further your own ambitions. If our soldiers are our people’s protectors, then it stands to reason that magic must be used to protect our soldiers.\n\nThe advent of gunpowder weaponry has changed how warfare is conducted. The height advantage a harpy army once had now leaves them as target practice for a skilled musketeer. The mages at Muhaqaar have been working on anti-trajectile charms that can be worn by our harpy soldiers that project a magic field that can slow down pellets fired from these weapons. It would take a lot of funding for the mages to get this project in motion, but did Elikhet himself not say it is the duty of those with magic to protect the people of the Sorrow?"
 duwarkani_elikhet_the_architect_title:0 "Elikhet the Architect"
 duwarkani_elikhet_the_architect_desc:0 "The lizardfolk have embraced Nirakhetism with a fervour beyond our expectations. Copies of the teachings of Elikhet have been made at the library in Koroshesh and brought back to Zerat to be poured over to learn from his wisdom. One area of Kheteratan history that has captured their imagination is the era of Elikhet the Architect; when Elikhet travelled up and down the Sorrow, constructing the many Wonders of Kheterata.\n\nElikhet’s power in his time as Elikhet the Architect is so far beyond what we can accomplish today, but the lizardfolk believe they can mimic some of his methods. Flight is a key one, which harpies can assist with. A top down view is an incredible tool for an architect. The second is the ability to magically project blueprints onto the soil from above. The machine they want to build to accomplish this will take an incredible amount of damestear to power, but with it they assure us reconstructing the Wonders of Elikhet will be much simpler."
 duwarkani_elikhets_chosen_dynasty_title:0 "Elikhet's Chosen"
 duwarkani_elikhets_chosen_dynasty_desc:0 "Elikhet decreed that magic must be used to protect Kheterata. We continue to provide our soldiers with every form of magical protection we can muster. Yet how can we possibly continue to call the Menkaunswt dynasty protectors of its people if they themselves cannot use magic? Tell the mages that the Menkaunswt bloodline must be enhanced so we can protect our people to the fullest of our capabilities. It is what they deserve, and what Elikhet would have wanted us to do."
 duwarkani_taneyas_spies_title:0 "Taneyas Spies"
 duwarkani_taneyas_spies_desc:0 "The Nzeri Harpies of Khetapera are not the only harpies that live in the area. Across in the jungles of Taneyas lies a significantly smaller population of harpies who live up in the mountains of the Ertikan Starash. Although tolerated by the lizardfolk, they are not official citizens and owe no allegiance to their crown - although neither did they owe allegiance to the Munzeri crown. Yet within Duwarkani they will find friends and family. With their ability to fly freely across the border, we should be able to win them over to our side and spy on the lizardfolk nations across the border."
 duwarkani_bring_nirakhetism_to_taneyas_title:0 "Bring Nirkahet to Taneyas"
 duwarkani_bring_nirakhetism_to_taneyas_desc:0 "When the first Nzeri Harpies fled Bulwar, many of them died in the migration. The final few who made it to Khetapera felt they could never shed enough tears to mourn for all their brethren who were lost on the journey. It was then the Nzeri Harpies first learned of Nirakhet. Learned that, even if there is nobody left in this plane who will mourn your death, Mother Nirakhet will always be there to weep for you, and for all her children.\n\nWe need to bring this truth to Taneyas. The lizardfolk are taught that their lives do not matter. That every lizardfolk is but a stepping stone on the path to a mythical, non-existent empire. None will mourn their death for it is but another notch on the way to the final empire, save for Nirakhet. She will weep for you. Scale or feather, Mother Nirakhet weeps for all."
 duwarkani_forget_the_prophecy_title:0 "Forget the Prophecy"
 duwarkani_forget_the_prophecy_desc:0 "In the ancient city of Zerat stands a majestic spire, as tall as a mountain. Its presence has inspired many a lizardfolk architect to construct wondrous buildings in its image. Yet their minds are clouded by the naga - a foul type of limbless lizardfolk, their minds corrupted by the power magic brings. They flood the minds of the lizardfolk with a prophecy. We weep for their lost potential, as Mother Nirakhet weeps for them when they pass away, their true capabilities locked behind layers of lies and false promises. Save them, and they can find true meaning building wonders to Elikhet and Nirakhet."
 duwarkani_nzeri_pilgrimages_title:0 "Nzeri Pilgrimages"
 duwarkani_nzeri_pilgrimages_desc:0 "As Nirakhetism spreads amongst the lizardfolk, the desire to learn more about the holy mother grows. Nzeri Harpies are seen almost as prophets of the faith, but only the upper class can afford to travel to one of the Holy Nzeri Temples in Khetapera to speak with experts of the faith. Mother Nirakeht is for all, for she weeps for all, so we need to move more harpies into Taneyas to act as guides for the lizardfolk. Zerat would be the ideal spot for a temple for the lizardfolk. Its historical importance means all roads already lead to the ancient city."
 duwarkani_understanding_the_shadows_title:0 "Understanding the Shadows"
 duwarkani_understanding_the_shadows_desc:0 "The Shadow Swamp’s evil spills out of numerous passes in the mountain. It’s an ever-present evil, whose decay seemingly cannot be contained. For every time we repelled the hordes of Yezel Mora, it did not stop the spread of shadow. At one of the openings in Taneyas stands another of the great lizardfolk spires, yet this one seems corrupted, as though the shadows penetrated its inner workings. If we are to understand the spread of the Shadow Swamp, these openings may be where we can start our research, and at the very least halt its spread."

 flavor_duwarkani.1.t:0 "Kenmu and Safana"
 flavor_duwarkani.1.d:0 "The marriage of the harpy queen Safana of Munzeri and the head of the once-great Menkaunswt dynasty was not a marriage of love but desperation and diplomacy. To unite the Nzeri Harpies and the humans who lived around the important fort of Duwarkani, a political marriage was swiftly arranged to unite the two people. Marriages between humans and harpies, while not completely unheard of, were extremely rare in Kheterata.\n\nYet while it may not have started as a whirlwind romance, it soon became one. In particular, Kenmu was enthralled by Safana’s faith in Nirakhet, the mother of the god and founder of Kheterata Elikhet. In their nation’s precarious position, as well as the slow death of the Menkaunswt family, the promise that Nirakhet would be there to comfort Kenmu and his family should they die was comforting."

 flavor_duwarkani.2.t:0 "Assassination!"
 flavor_duwarkani.2.d:0 "Tragedy has struck Duwarkani! As the royal couple strolled along the stone walls of the city, a soldier who knelt before them suddenly sprung up, a dagger in each hand, and plunged them into the bowels of the King and Queen. Their blood pooled together on the battlements as the life flickered out from their eyes, grasping each other in a deathly embrace. They were dead before any physician or apothecary could reach them.\n\nThe assassin made no attempt to run. He wanted the people of the country to know why he did what he did. Knowing there would be a public trial before his hanging, he used that opportunity to address the crowd. Using the legacy of Castan II "Beastbane", the infamous king of Castanor who liberated Kheterata from gnollish rule, the assassin decried the mixing of humanity with "monsters". What next, he proclaimed. Humans marrying gnolls? Lizardfolk? Trolls!? He said he had to do something before humanity fell to the beasts."

 flavor_duwarkani.3.d:0 "Much of the genie complex of Esuvrem had been scoured by the Fieldstalker Gnoll populace, harvesting the valuable metals that permeate its halls. Deep within its confines, in a large hall, our expedition found a tomb emblazoned with what was unmistakably the Silver Dragon of Castanor. We found it! Beastbane’s final resting place. A journal lay next to his body, many of the pages damaged but on it was written an ancient form Common, the written language of Castanor.\n\n"...genie largely ignored our presence, unfussed by our search. Castan ordered several of our party to the lower depths to find the Pit of Grilax. I imagine they will simply head to the surface to search for food, if not abandon the party entirely, as many have already...”\n\n"...insists that the world tree must be the true source of all beasts, as it was in Escann. This sent Dostor into a fit of rage, detailing the many altering tales of what this birthplace of beasts truly resembles...”\n\n"...burn the tree, and the shadows will dissipate...\n"...come to the conclusion that there is no...\n"...no home to return to, for my home is by Castan...\n"...bury him here, in hope the gnolls do not feast on..."

 flavor_duwarkani.6.d:0 "As the peasants marched through the open gates of the castle in Duwarkani, their boisterousness faltered. Every one of the Nzeri Harpy soldiers were neither wearing armor nor bearing arms. Instead their heads were bowed to the mob, disarming the anger they had started the day with.\n\nThe peasants had been brought to the castle by dissatisfied nobles, worried that their power would be stripped away from them by the growing military might of the Menkaunswt house. They spread horror stories of mercenaries entering villages to strip the farmers of all their worldly possessions, with no recompense as the Harpy Queen gathered more power to her side. Their story was starting to fall apart though. Not one soldier, human nor harpy, had laid a hand on the encroaching mob. Not a single soldier even had a sword.\n\nIt was at this moment that Queen [Root.Monarch.GetName] emerged from the palace doors and entered the crowd. Some raised the pitchforks and scythes they had brought anticipating a fight, prompting a few of the bowed soldiers to stir and start to step forward, before being brought to a standstill by a sharp gaze from Queen [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As the crowd’s murmurs silenced, the Queen spoke.\n\n"When Elikhet gave up his divinity, it was to protect his people. His sacrifice is what allowed the people of the Mother’s Sorrow to flourish. If we wanted to, he could have crushed any Kheteratan with ease. But his power was not used to subjugate, but to rule and protect.\n\n"People of Duwarkani. We do not turn our soldiers against our own people. Every one of you that would die would cause me to weep, as it would Nirakhet. We are not here to subjugate you. We are your guardians. We are your protectors. We are the Paladins of the Sorrow, and we will fight to the last to defend every single one of you.""

 flavor_duwarkani.7.t:0 "The Dual Monarchs"
 flavor_duwarkani.7.d:0 "Duwarkani started as a marriage between a human and harpy royal family in a pact as equals, a tradition which has maintained ever since. When a Queen of the Menkaunswt dynasty rises to lead the nation, her first duty is to choose a consort to share the throne and the duties of the monarchy. One must look for a husband who can assist in administering affairs within the growing nation, be amicable with the many diplomatic visits visitors, and be able to direct the mixed-race army of the nation should the need arise.\n\nThese traits can be surprisingly difficult to find amongst the nobility, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] has narrowed the list down to her two preferred candidates."

 flavor_duwarkani.8.t:0 "The Naga Go Missing"
 flavor_duwarkani.8.d:0 "Our authority to rule the lizardfolk has regularly been undermined by the naga. These are a strange, snakelike mutation of lizardfolk that lack any limbs but in exchange have extraordinary magical power. They hold positions of religious and cultural importance, and have not taken kindly at all to the spread of Nirakhetism amongst their kind.\n\nWhich is why it has been a relief that their protests have died down recently. More disconcertingly, they appear to have disappeared entirely. Our Kheteratan advisors are celebrating the end of Anzalkatsa resistance in the lizardfolk jungles, but the more cautious amongst them are insisting we should double our efforts and find where the naga have gone, lest they return with greater support."

Anzalkatsa zealots, demanding the dissolution of Duwarkani rule over Taneyas so that the prophecy of the 333rd Empire will return, have risen up in Zerat. Each mob led by a naga, they have vowed to not stand down until the naga have been returned to their rightful place as guides of the lizardfolk and stamped out faith in Nirakhet."

 flavor_duwarkani.10.d:0 "The Ahati Brotherhood have styled themselves as chivalric guardians of the Sorrow. They take an oath to support the Steward, although in their eyes who warrants the title of "Steward” does not always align with who the Khetarch has anointed Steward. This can lead to tension between the Brotherhood and the state itself, especially when the Steward attempts to enact a law that the Ahati disagree with.\n\nIn particular, the Ahati have taken issue with the orders to open their doors to non-humans. Historically no non-humans were allowed to join the Ahati. Even elves during the time of the Phoenix Empire were not allowed to join, although the rules were relaxed for half-elves. But harpies, lizardfolk, and even gnolls?\n\nFor now the tension is merely below the surface. Most of the arguments have not been with the ruling monarchy, but amongst the Ahati themselves. Debates over the true purpose of the Brotherhood, who counts as a citizen of the Sorrow, and what it takes to be a true Ahati, have started raging internally. Their quasi-independent status means it will be difficult to enforce the new laws on them, but for now the Ahati leadership are complying."

The Ahati leader reached the executioner who, rather than lift the noose around the traitor’s neck, instead took a knife and calmly cut the man’s bonds. Panic erupted from the crowd as multiple others strode forward, revealing the bronze dragon emblem on their chests, and joined the Ahati on the platform. The leader raised a dagger in the air and cried "Oh Aakhet, I summon thee. Destroy these Menkaunswt monsters who claim your crown!”\n\nA whirlwind of flame erupted from one of the bystanders. Their figure morphed and grew into the figure of a gigantic bronze dragon, the wind scattering a screaming audience as the Ahati roared their approval on Aakhet’s arrival. Right as the whirlwind of flame stopped, the dragon’s head swooped down with alarming speed and, in one bite, swallowed most of the Ahati on stage. The remaining Ahati screamed and jumped off the platform, with only the leader left with a look of shock locked into his face.\n\n"You absolute fools”, boomed the great dragon. "You think you can order me? You think you know what King Menkaunswt would have wanted? I was the one who created the Ahati. I was the Warrior King. I was King Menkaunswt.” With a snort, a burst of flame billowed out from his snout, turning the Ahati to ash. "To think they believed I would assist them after they had already lost their civil war. I am genuinely offended. When the King of Kheterata wanted assistance from Castanor due to his own weakness, do you know what I did? I kicked him off the tower in Kheterat and claimed the throne for myself.” It’s difficult to tell a dragon’s expression, but the tone of voice suggested a mix of pride and nostalgia. His silence continued as he gazed into the sky, before turning his head and dropping it to Queen [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s level.\n\n"You overcame this challenge not by relying on allies, but through your own strength. You may not worship me like the Ahati do, but your strength is undeniable. The Sorrow has been ruled by one with wings multiple times before. The Brotherhood would do well to remember the one they idolise had wings too.” His head dropped until it was right in front of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s face. Again, telling a dragon’s expression is difficult, but what spread across Aakhet’s face was undeniably a smile. "You have her eyes.”"

 flavor_duwarkani.12.d:0 "The Annual March of Castanor’s Legions had been held every year in Anarat, although its importance over the years had waned. It celebrated the liberation of Kheterata by Castan II after its subjugation by the gnolls of the first Xhazobine. This year, however, the festival had gained significantly more attention than usual. It was seen as a festival celebrating antiquated and horrible ideas about "monstrous” races. At the centre of the controversy was the legacy of Castan II, or as he was more commonly known, Beastbane.\n\nCastan "Beastbane” first codified the difference between civilized and "monstrous” races during the nascent days of Castanor. He led humanity on marches across Escann, Bulwar, and Kheterata to wipe out monsters in what was called the Second Great Cleansing. At the march in Anarat, people dress up as Castanorian legions, wearing furs to symbolise the gnolls slaughtered by his legions, along with feathers in their helmets for the many harpies slain in Bulwar.\n\nWhat started as a localised debate over remembering history soon turned into a nationwide conflict. Many harpies and gnolls were shocked to discover just how many Kheteratans still saw Beastbane as a hero to humanity, where in their eyes he was a genocidal maniac who caused untold destruction. Families were splitting over the debates. Harpies leaving human-dominated settlements to return to the mountains in Khetapera. Gnollish merchants were refusing to sell to humans. [Root.GetName] was being torn apart from the inside."

For example, sacrificing animals and painting blood across your fur in a ritual to ward off demons. This ritual can leave stained fur in the patterns associated with the xhazobkult, which a keen eye would be able to recognise. The problem is it is difficult for even the well-informed to recognise the difference between a benign marking used to ward off demons and the markings of those gnolls who are trying to summon demons.\n\nKheteratans are, as a general rule, not well-informed on the differences between xhazobkultish rituals. So when one gnoll was found in a market with said markings, the crowd held an impromptu trial to condemn the gnoll for trying to summon a xhazob. To add to the controversy, the gnoll was decapitated in front of the cheering crowd by a man dressed as Castan II, complete with emblems of the Silver Dragon of Castanor.\n\nWord of this spread like wildfire across the gnollish communities, who are furious that one of their people were the victims of such a cruel extrajudicial killing and have started demanding compensation."

It takes one truly devoted to the cause of Mother Nirakhet to become a Nzeri Harpy paladin, and that level of religious fervour only adds to the difficulty for the two sides to hold a conversation.\n\nThis hasn’t been a problem in the past, but recently the humans have started calling them "creepy” or, even worse, "monsters”. With the legacy of Beastbane looming large in society currently, to be called "monsters” has greatly offended the harpies who join our armies. At first only a few protested, but the situation erupted into a full-blown revolt, with many harpies expressing their desire to leave the army altogether."

For much of lizardfolk history, they considered humans as beneath them, and not worth interacting with. It wasn’t until Kheterata defeated the empire of Karassk that the term "monster” was used to describe lizardfolk by the Kheteratans.\n\nIt is safe to say now that most lizardfolk have heard of Beastbane, and their reaction has been one of horror and disgust that humans still celebrate his legacy. Some more radical voices in lizardfolk society have used the prominence of the story as proof that humans simply aren’t fit to rule, such is their tendency towards barbarism. The temples to Nirakhet across Taneyas have had their entryways barred, with no emissaries of the government allowed to enter.

It was the small population of Delta Gnomes in Koroshesh who first greeted Castan Beastbane as a liberator into Kheterata, and he maintains a generally more positive image amongst their population than other non-human races. They have avoided scrutiny from the non-human races for their beliefs due to their small population and the fact Koroshesh sits a long distance away from the gnolls and harpies who live south of Kheterat, but something has shot their stance into the spotlight.\n\nOne Delta Gnome published what can only be called as the most hateful screed against monstrous races ever to grace the Mother’s Sorrow. He uses Elikhet’s word to justify why all creatures who do not possess smooth skin across their body should have their internal organs removed and used to power magical artefacts to protect those races who do deserve protection.\n\nWhile this was hardly a popular opinion amongst gnomes, unfortunately its widespread underground publication has sent a backlash towards the gnomes from most of the rest of our nation. The backlash has in turn prompted a rally around the flag effect amongst the Delta Gnome population to protect each other, even turning to them defending the words written in the publication. If we allow this to continue without punishing those who defend the screed, many see it as being the state’s tacit endorsement of it."

After Beastbane liberated Kheterata in 570 BA, he set out with a Castanorian Legion to hunt for the mythical birthplace of all monsters. The Pit of Grilax was a supposed portal to the plane of demons from which all monsters emerged. Beastbane’s Legion never returned, but that did not stop the rumours of this location persisting.\n\nThe most popular version of the story is that Beastbane’s Legion did find the Pits and continue to stand guard over its entrance so that Halann would not be swamped by monsters forever more. If we can disprove this theory and track down the path taken by the Castanorian Legion, perhaps that would end the debate.\n\nThe idea of tracking down a path taken by a single legion over 2000 years ago is fanciful, but it got a boost when archivists in Koroshesh uncovered letters from a legionnaire on Beastbane’s travels who wrote about travelling into the area today known as Gazraak. Both sides of the aisle support scouring the area for clues, albeit for very different reasons. If we can find evidence of Beastbane’s legion graves and no Grilax, we know their quest was always based on a myth. If we find the Pits of Grilax however..."

Red-robed figures stalk its plains, ghostly figures of the dead wander, sometimes silently grabbing at one of our soldiers and dragging them out of sight. Distant white castles are all one can see through the ever present fog. Why did we go here? What could we possibly hope to find? The Pit of Grilax? As horrid as this place may be, there is no chance this could be the birthplace of anything. All that comes from here is death.\n\nSuddenly, up ahead, something completely unlike anything else in this monochrome environment was spotted: a campfire. How anyone found materials to burn here was beyond our explorer’s knowledge, but the figures around the camp were clearly not of this realm either. They were human. Haggard yes, but living and breathing. As our band approached them, the group drew their swords and shouted at us in what sounded like an old form of Cannorian Common. Whatever they shouted, it was not friendly.\n\nWe had come too far though to not get answers from the first people in this plane we could potentially communicate with. One Korosheshi soldier, who studied linguistics at Anbenncost in his youth, trepidatiously moved forward alone and yelled to the group: “We come in peace. We came here on a quest to stem the flow of shadow into our world. Do you have any information that could help us?\n\nThe group looked at each other, their eyes eventually settling on one especially grizzled looking individual in their midst. The man stepped forward and walked towards the Korosheshi soldier, sword still gripped firmly in hand, the faded symbol on his breastplate becoming clearer: the Silver Dragon of Castanor.\n\n"I am Castan II, commander of this legion, and King of Castanor. If you are looking to stem the flow of shadow, simply look behind you at those beasts who brought you here.""

The furor over his legacy had only just started to die down, and this threatened to reignite the controversy. What was he doing in the shadow plane? Was he dead? Whose grave was found at Esuvrem? These questions couldn’t be left unanswered, so a second expedition entered the shadow plane, retracing the steps to the Castanorian camp. Fewer non-humans went this time, and kept a distance away from the camp, prepared to rush in should the situation get violent.\n\nThe second attempt at diplomacy started well. Castan sat back while his second-in-command, a man by the name of Dostor, spoke to the expedition about the dangers to look out for when traversing the shadow plane. His language grew more colourful as he spoke, becoming more animated, evidently delighted at the opportunity to speak to someone other than the small band of men that made up the last members of Beastbane’s Legion.\n\n“The Red Reapers are not a threat. Sure they can rip your soul from your flesh in a flash, but they are far too busy with their own business to bother with a mortal like yourself. If you get in their way though, they will hunt you down like a harpies after the one man who bathes”. He tipped his head back and barked out a laugh, before catching himself and shooting a look over at the various non-human soldiers standing some distance away. The awkwardly long silence was eventually broken by Castan.\n\n“In Bulwar we found so many villages whose entire fit male population had been taken by harpies. Husbands and sons taken. Mothers left to try care not just for their children, but for the elderly men who the beasts had no interest in. Many of the towns were completely empty. We never knew if they had fled after their men were taken by harpies, or the gnolls had simply murdered them all. This is the fate of all who live alongside beasts. You consider those monsters your allies? To them, you are their playthings, and they will dispose of you when they tire."

They spoke of their quest to find the Pit of Grilax, going off increasingly vague clues to various locations in Eastern Sarhal. The final goal had been to enter the Shadow Swamp, find the world tree they had been told was located at its centre, and burn it to the ground. This was what they had done with the world tree in Escann to fight the influence of the fey, and it was theorised torching the world tree here would end the spread of monsters into the human world.\n\n“Not that we ever found that tree”, Dostor said, glancing over his shoulder to ensure Castan was not within earshot. “It wasn’t until your strange party of beasts and men arrived that I learned it did exist. I don’t know how we missed it, or how we ended up here. I’ve always said the doors to the lands of death swung right open when they saw us approaching, recognising all our contributions to their lands.” He swung back his head and laughed again, with a few other members of the legion also grimly chuckling.\n\n“What could have possibly compelled your merry gang to come to this place anyways”, he asked. One of the group explained finding the tomb in Esuvrem, assuming it was Beastbane inside, and brought forward the journal that was found there. As Dostar thumbed through it, his hands started to shake. When he spoke again, it was in a much softer tone than his usual. “This journal belonged to Rogiec, a fellow legionnaire who left this camp to find water a long time ago and never returned. I had not thought of him in ages.\n\nHis voice began to tremble. “That tomb was my brothers. He was a true believer in Castan and in Castanor. He did not want his grave to have his own name. He simply wanted it to say that he was a true soldier of Castan.” With a jolt, he grabbed the translator by the arm and pulled him in. “His name was Tomar. You must remember his name. You must mourn his death. I cannot cry anymore. This place robs you of that ability. You must do it for me."

The number of members of the legion had also been dropping. Castan was still there, and still refusing to speak to anyone, but Dostar was nowhere to be found. Nobody would tell the expedition what happened, although they did shoot glances over at a river of smoke that flowed near the camp. By its banks lay discarded armour emblazoned with a silver dragon.\n\nThose left were less conversational, but were eager to listen to our expedition, almost no matter the subject. One younger soldier was going through the many talismans he was wearing and explaining what each one was for. “This one protects against fire. It has a small core of Damestear at its centre, isn’t that interesting? This one is from my hometown in Samsumbat. It doesn’t have any magical properties, but it reminds me of home. This is a symbol of Nirakhet. With this at my side, it lets me know she will protect me, care for me if I am injured in battle, and care for my soul if I do die. Oh, this was made by my wife. You can see the feather inside, that’s one of her own. She’s a harpy you see, and…well…”\n\nThe soldier stuttered to a stop as he realised what he was saying. He looked at the legionnaire he was speaking to, whose facial expression hadn’t moved. Then, he pointed at one of the talismans. “Tell me more about this one. You said she’ll tend to my soul when I pass on? Do I just need to hold it?” The young soldier stared in shock, before taking the talisman off and handing it to the legionnaire. “You can have it if you want. You don’t need to hold it though. Mother Nirakhet weeps for all her children. It’s just that holding it reminds me of that, and it can give me strength when I’m afraid and…”, his voice faded away as the legionnaire examined the talisman. “For everyone?” he asked. “Even monsters?”\n\n“Yes! I mean, we don’t call harpies or gnolls monsters like you do, but yes she weeps for them too.” The legionnaire smiled grimly and said nothing."

With various wards painted onto their bodies, the latest expedition ventured away from the path that led towards the Castanorian encampment and towards a distant white castle the red-robed figures had been seen walking towards. Yet partway into the trek, the trolls started to veer off course and into a forest of dead trees, as though a voice was commanding them. Despite the rest of the group’s protestations, the trolls continued to veer off path, with the rest having no alternative but to follow, for they did not trust their own ability to return to the portal back to the plane of the living.\n\nSoon the group came to a grove filled with red-petalled flowers, their colour incredibly striking in this otherwise monochrome world. There in the middle, smoking a knobbly old pipe, sat the most gruesome looking hag one had ever seen. She took a long smoke of her pipe held in one hand while beckoning the trolls forward with her warty finger. The lead troll started to step forward in a dreamlike fashion, until he dropped a talisman he was holding in his hand: a symbol of Nirakhet. The troll blinked, looked down at the talisman, then slowly bent down, picked it up, placed it around his neck, and then pointed a finger at the hag.\n\n“You have no control over me anymore Lady Smoketusk. You may have created us, but we are now free to choose our own dreams.” The defiance in his words belied an obvious terror beneath his voice. The hag cackled in response. “I could wrap you all around this finger once again - as if your presence here was not proof of that. Or did you choose to come here? I sincerely doubt that.” She cackled again and took another large puff from her pipe. “I simply have no more use for you. I have no need for tools who cannot protect a world tree.”\n\nThe hag stood up, tossed her pipe into the air where it grew into a walking stick before falling back into her hand. She turned and started to walk away, before turning back. “Oh, and I did not create your kind. I simply purchased you. Bought from a giant in exchange for an enchanted bow. Perhaps I should have kept the bow. Would have been more useful against harpies than your kind was.” She shot a look of pure hate at the rest of the party, before limping away into the blackness of the forest."

One of them was a Nirakhetist talisman. Castan spotted the band as they approached, nodding to acknowledge their presence, but did not shoot his usual looks towards the non-human members. Instead, he pointed to one of the figures in the river.\n\n"That was a lizardfolk soul. I didn't know who they were until I met your band. I had naturally assumed they were another spawn of Agrados, as they were in here with the gnolls and centaurs and harpies, along with the humans and dwarves I had taken as traitors of their race. Why else would they be in this stream? There must be other streams purely for the chosen of Castellos." Beastbane stepped closer to the stream. "I searched for the stream for us. The noble Castanorian Legion, who defended humanity from the monsters. Yet all streams contained the souls of all sentient beings. Even creatures I do not recognise, like giant walking felines, I have observed in this stream."\n\nHe took another step towards the stream until his foot was almost touching it. "Is your nation of Duwarkani like this? All souls drifting together like equals? I still find that impossible to believe. Such a thing would make us no different from the monsters. It would make me a monster for slaying them. We killed so many. I killed so many..."\n\nBeastbane turned around, and for the first time in their meetings, addressed the harpy bodyguard who stood alongside the interpreter. "Would Nirakhet shed a tear for even someone like me?" Before she could answer, he turned and stepped into the stream.

With enough portable magical barriers, we should be able to send our forces into the Shadow Plane to learn more about the true nature of the world."
