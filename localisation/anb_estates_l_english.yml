By contrast, the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ argue that their superior pedigree and connections to our nation's elite makes them a far more fitting choice than some insular courtiers.

The extra organ grants a preternatural extra sense, as it will twitch and blink when it seems to notice something the other two don’t, putting the individual on alert.

This is normally a detriment as it impacts their combat ability, but in recent history they found a niche in Shangra as gentle and precise craftsmen that can achieve works that are nearly impossible for those with tough claws. As more Softclaws migrated to Shangra to find a place where their skills are appreciated, it soon became rarer to find a tough-clawed lizardfolk in Shangra than their more delicate counterparts."

 estate_burghers_duuma_mutation_desc:0 "In what seems to be an example of convergent evolution, Tsurin lizardfolk, Duuma, have mutated to look remarkably similar to kobolds. They are smaller but more dexterous with much larger eyes, granting them improved  eyesight.

At night, when the sand cools down, young lizardfolk hatch from their eggs and take their first night swim. This mutation of lizardfolk makes for a great sailor and naval trader, but their sea legs can sometimes let them down on dry land."

 estate_nobility_shanyza_mutation_desc:0 "Shanyzas are lizardfolk mutation born on the border of the Ashhana, forged in the heat of a millennia of conflict. Their scales are hardened and shining, almost as if they were made from metal, and are able to withstand even a shot from a musket. Despite the weight of their shimmering scales, they can still march for long distances, but do not expect them to move with much speed."
 estate_burghers_thanats_mutation:0 "§OThanats§!"
 estate_burghers_thanats_mutation_desc:0 "Thanats are lizardfolk mutation, native to the lake Sutsanaak. They have four arms, allowing them to be quick and agile workers, doing multiple tasks at the same time. To compensate for the extra arms, each individual arm has less muscle, making some types of heavy equipment more difficult to use.
