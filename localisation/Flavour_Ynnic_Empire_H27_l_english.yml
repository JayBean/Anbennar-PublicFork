 flavor_ynnic_empire.10.t:0 "The Moon Field"
 flavor_ynnic_empire.10.d:0 "East of the city of Arverynn, between the Arverynn, Munynn, and Cydynn rivers, lies a stretch of fertile plains, said to be as bountiful as the lands that surround the Golden Dome of Stanyrhrada, or the coveted lands surrounding the Malacynn. This area has long been referred to as the Moon Field, named for two things: the old temple mound, named Munkarel in the Sarda tongue, that stands at its centre, ontop which an ancient abandoned monastery stands, and the clear skies that seemingly appear every full moon.\n\nHowever, the majority of these plains have remained untamed, its untapped potential remaining out of reach for even the likes of Calrodiy the Great. Previous attempts at settling the Moon Field were always met with disaster; the Veykodan Misztaheth tribes that inhabit these plains are fierce in their resistance to any Ynnic encroaching, and have ties to many other, stronger tribes, which they have called upon in the past to aid against our settlement attempts. Then there are also the beasts that roam through the Veykodan overlands, including the Moon Field; giant monstrosities that swim through the ground and cause the ground to shatter and tremble, swallowing up entire regiments, and serpentlike creatures, capable of felling dozens of Ynnic knights with one swipe.\n\nBut that was the past. Now, the time seems right to expand our dominion and tap into the wealth of these fields. The Krahnorians that arrived from beyond the cliffs have weakened the Veykodan tribes, and innovations in our armies have made us able to not just survive against, but kill the creatures that once seemed unstoppable.\n\nWhat shall we do, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 flavor_ynnic_empire.10.a:0 "These fields will be tamed by sword and by arrow."
 flavor_ynnic_empire.10.b:0 "Fetch my treasurer! This will require many coins.."
 flavor_ynnic_empire.10.c:0 "Approach the merchants, minor lords, and adventurers, surely they will want to invest?"
 flavor_ynnic_empire.10.e:0 "We don’t have the resources for this now."
 flavor_ynnic_empire.10.f:0 "Approach the Misztaheth tribes; surely they prefer us over the Krahnorians?"
 flavor_ynnic_empire.10.g:0 "A perfect opportunity to expand the Predyvens system!"
 flavor_ynnic_empire.10.h:0 "I know just the right people for this! Now where did I keep those maps?"

 flavor_ynnic_empire.11.t:0 "The Moon Field is ours!"
 flavor_ynnic_empire.11.d:0 "Our efforts to tame the Moon Field have paid off! Where once there were empty plains and wandering tribes, now villages dot the plains, surrounded by fields bringing in a great harvest of grains and vegetables, and recently even orchards, cared for from sapling to mighty trees, have begun providing yields. Some of these villages have already started resembling towns, the proximity to Arverynn and the Krahnorians providing opportunities of wealth to be made, and roads have sprung up connecting all of these new settlements. Thanks to our efforts, the Moon Field is now one of the most bountiful regions of the Ynn, and will likely only improve."
 flavor_ynnic_empire.11.a:0 "A glorious day for the Ynnic Empire!"
