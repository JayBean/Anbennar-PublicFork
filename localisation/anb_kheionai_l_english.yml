 kheionai.0.a:0 "We must prepare."

 kheionai.1:0 "Death Wind"
 kheionai.1.t:0 "The Azure Death Comes"
 kheionai.1.d:0 "Word comes from the north, carried by the brave and foolhardy who venture those waters - the Kaydhano stirs. The winds again sweep that great poisoned waste, stirring the desert’s life-stealing sands, and soon enough they will whip south to ravage Alecand. Already the news spreads like wildfire throughout the kheions and into the countryside, and those who dare to live beyond the wind wards are making preparations to move into the cities to weather the storms. Over the coming weeks, all life begins to revolve around preparation for the Death Winds, and normal economic activity slows down as people focus on surviving the worst."
 kheionai.1.a:0 "The Death Wind will be upon us soon."

 kheionai.5.t:0 "Wind Wards Sabotaged!"
 kheionai.5.d:0 "The wind wards that surround the kheions are durable and mighty, capable of withstanding some of the most devastating physical and magical bombardments of Halann. They are also, to those who understand them, very fragile, and the removal or damage of just one or two components can defeat their protective measures and leave large sections of a kheion unwarded.\n\nBecause of their value and vulnerability, the windwards are always a target. Recently, our soldiers have captured saboteurs attempting to damage our protections! We presume they have been sent by our rivals to ensure we are weakened by the deathwinds when next they come - we will have to deal with them in force to punish them for such an underhanded and duplicitous trespass."
 kheionai.5.a:0 "Bastards!"

 kheionai.6.t:0 "A New People?"
 kheionai.6.d:0 "For years now we have lost the ties to our Alecandi overlords, as time passes people change and some no longer consider us to be the same as our cousins that never left the island."

 kheionai.7.d:0 "Helper Event"
 kheionai.7.a:0 "Okay."

 kheionai.8.t:0 "The Quiet After the Storm"
 kheionai.8.d:0 "After many years the Deathwinds have subsided, the great winds shifting away from the northeast and carrying only the smell of sea salt and mountain air on the breeze. A week of rejoicing reigns in the kheions, folk from all walks of life celebrating another ordeal endured. Slowly the people begin to trickle out of the cities - returning to farms and outlying fields to rebuild, boarding ships as envoys, fishermen, or traders, or even wandering simply for the sake of leaving the confines in which they have been so long imprisoned. Life returns to normal - as normal as it is in Alecand - for a time, and we would do well to seize this opportunity to look beyond our borders again."
 kheionai.8.a:0 "The Death Wind is over."

 kheionai.9.t:0 "The Storm"
 kheionai.9.d:0 "As always, it came upon the land slowly, the winds shifting to blow from the northeast. The first winds whisked along small flecks of blue, little more than a whisper of doom to the untrained eye. But the first flecks were followed soon after by ever more intense winds carrying azure death, the poison sands blighting the ground and spreading sickness wherever they land, the air itself becoming a herald of cancer and contagion. The terrible days have come again to Alecand, those winds of death ready to wipe the land clean and steal the lives of any not sheltered behind the wind wards. The cities are filled to bursting with refugees, the granaries are stocked full and rationed tightly as we wait out the Kaydhano’s wrath."
 kheionai.9.a:0 "The Death Wind is here."

 kheionai.12.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.12.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand. These peoples now identify more strongly with their nékhei than the parent city that may rule over them. From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.12.a: "We forge our own path now!"

 kheionai.14.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.14.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand. These peoples now identify more strongly with their nékhei than the parent city that may rule over them. From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.14.a: "As long as they still bend the knee"
