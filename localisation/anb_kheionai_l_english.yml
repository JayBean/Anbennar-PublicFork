 kheionai.0.t:0 "The Death Winds"
 kheionai.0.d:0 "A rural mother tucks her children into bed and makes them recite their evacuation plans, the same as her mother made her do before her first Death Wind. A sailor out to sea holds his head in his hands, knowing he's too far out to sea to return home, and the magical tumors will ensure he never sees his wife again. A philosopher on Alecand stares at the hateful blue dust clouds on the horizon, content the purpose-built architecture and magical Windwards will protect him and his kheion.\n\nOverexposure to any kind of suffering will numb you to it. That's what the Kheionai tell themselves. You can only cower in fear for so long. And the Kheionai have lived in the Death Wind's malignant shadow for as long as there have been Kheionai: a great storm of poisonous blue sand from the Kaydhano Sea, carrying wicked magic that inflicts lethal cancers upon all exposed. It cannot be avoided. It cannot be stopped. All you can do is hope you can seek shelter in time. Life grinds to a halt as the Death Winds strip the soil and mutilate flesh. It suffocates a nation like a smothered infant.\n\nThe Kheionai have learned how to prepare for the inevitable as best they can. There simply isn't any other choice. So long as the Kheionai maintain their fragile Windwards, their young civilization may yet survive."
 kheionai.0.a:0 "The mages predict the next storm in one year."

 kheionai.1:0 "Death Wind"
 kheionai.1.t:0 "The Azure Death Comes"
 kheionai.1.d:0 "Word comes from the north, carried by the brave and foolhardy who venture those waters - the Kaydhano stirs. The winds again sweep that great poisoned waste, stirring the desert’s life-stealing sands, and soon enough they will whip south to ravage Alecand. Already the news spreads like wildfire throughout the kheions and into the countryside, and those who dare to live beyond the Windwards are making preparations to move into the cities to weather the storms. Over the coming weeks, all life begins to revolve around preparation for the Death Winds, and normal economic activity slows down as people focus on surviving the worst."
 kheionai.1.a:0 "The Death Wind will be upon us soon."

 kheionai.5.t:0 "Windwards Sabotaged!"
 kheionai.5.d:0 "The Windwards that surround the kheions are durable and mighty, capable of withstanding some of the most devastating physical and magical bombardments of Halann. They are also, to those who understand them, very fragile, and the removal or damage of just one or two components can defeat their protective measures and leave large sections of a kheion unwarded.\n\nBecause of their value and vulnerability, the windwards are always a target. Recently, our soldiers have captured saboteurs attempting to damage our protections! We presume they have been sent by our rivals to ensure we are weakened by the deathwinds when next they come - we will have to deal with them in force to punish them for such an underhanded and duplicitous trespass."
 kheionai.5.a:0 "Bastards!"

 kheionai.6.t:0 "A New People?"
 kheionai.6.d:0 "For years now we have lost the ties to our Alecandi overlords, as time passes people change and some no longer consider us to be the same as our cousins that never left the island."

 kheionai.7.a:0 "Okay."

 kheionai.8.t:0 "The Quiet After the Storm"
 kheionai.8.d:0 "After many years the Deathwinds have subsided, the great winds shifting away from the northeast and carrying only the smell of sea salt and mountain air on the breeze. A week of rejoicing reigns in the kheions, folk from all walks of life celebrating another ordeal endured. Slowly the people begin to trickle out of the cities - returning to farms and outlying fields to rebuild, boarding ships as envoys, fishermen, or traders, or even wandering simply for the sake of leaving the confines in which they have been so long imprisoned. Life returns to normal - as normal as it is in Alecand - for a time, and we would do well to seize this opportunity to look beyond our borders again."
 kheionai.8.a:0 "The Death Wind is over."

 kheionai.9.t:0 "The Storm"
 kheionai.9.d:0 "As always, it came upon the land slowly, the winds shifting to blow from the northeast. The first winds whisked along small flecks of blue, little more than a whisper of doom to the untrained eye. But the first flecks were followed soon after by ever more intense winds carrying azure death, the poison sands blighting the ground and spreading sickness wherever they land, the air itself becoming a herald of cancer and contagion. The terrible days have come again to Alecand, those winds of death ready to wipe the land clean and steal the lives of any not sheltered behind the Windwards. The cities are filled to bursting with refugees, the granaries are stocked full and rationed tightly as we wait out the Kaydhano’s wrath."
 kheionai.9.a:0 "The Death Wind is here."

 kheionai.12.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.12.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand. These peoples now identify more strongly with their nékhei than the parent city that may rule over them. From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.12.a: "We forge our own path now!"

 kheionai.14.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.14.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand.

From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.14.a: "As long as they still bend the knee"

 kheionai.16.t: "Growth of our Nékheis"
 kheionai.16.d: "Due to the steady growth of our nékheis, we are now able to pull more trade from them and the mainland for us."

 kheionai.19.t: "[From.GetName] Requests War Rights"
 kheionai.19.d: "Today our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] got a letter from [From.GetName] requesting the right to go to war. While this would help our colonization of the mainland, it will also hurt our trade until the war has finished and if they get too big they might start thinking about independence."

At the year’s Askovoinos festival, celebrated when the new vintage comes in, the diluted wine that is normally used in the feasts was secretly replaced with undiluted wine – with the mobs of Kimanis stirred into a drunken stupor, they massacred our garrison and any of our people still inside the city.

 degarikes_taychendi:0 "Though we have not always been seafaring people - even the Thekrystana, who rely on the water for their wealth, are ill at ease on the open ocean - one look at these ships is all it takes to know of their glory. Imagine an entire fleet of them, terrorising the seas and projecting Taychendi power across the waves! And with the secrets of the Slaver-Nobles beneath our feet, one wonders just how big these ships can get..."
 degarikes_eltibhari:0 "Though we may have achieved dominance over the island of Alecand itself, the Kheionai maintained an extensive maritime empire. With an endless expanse of open ocean to our shores, we have never truly been able to grasp naval combat - now, if we are to expand our Riei's domain further, we must master it. Thankfully, we can turn to our new territories to do so."

 degarikes_devandi:0 "The Chendhyan lake-pirates of the Taras'su Ervan made a habit of boarding trading vessels and unleashing their feline mounts on the unprepared sailors. Though we may not have the maritime traditions of the Kheionai, a distinct possibility arises when looking at their titanic vessels - they seem to be big enough to hold a large number of mounts at any one time, and they certainly have the armour to plunge into an enemy fleet and not be destroyed. Maybe it is time to let the open oceans know the terror a jaguar-rider can bring?"
 degarikes_oktikheion:0 "When we lost our fleet and our army north of the Kaydhano, we were forced to downsize our navy dramatically, our coffers exhausted. It took decades for our city's population to recover, and only after the seizure of Kimánis could we begin to prepare our naval resurgence, and begin to build more Degárikes. But over 50 years had passed since any of our engineers had laid eyes on them - it was a long and arduous process, even with the extensive plans already in our possession. We were not the first to bring back these ships, but we will not be the last. Our engineers have now made all the necessary preparations, and we can begin rebuilding our fleet at once."
 degarikes_kheionai:0 "When Oktikheion blundered their entire fleet and a quarter of their male population into a watery grave, the Degárikes, titanic in size and power, but expensive to build and maintain, nearly died with it. Oktikheion had long forced the other Kheions into a naval arms race in which they did not want to participate - when the biggest player was forced out of the game, the others raced to see who could withdraw the fastest. Now, with the world growing more dangerous, the need for these titanic ships once more grows. We were not the first to reintroduce them, but that will not deter us - our engineers have dusted off old naval plans, and we will soon begin construction."

#Events 
 kheionai.30.t:0 "New Threats on the Seas" 
 kheionai.30.d:0 "In 1397, the fleet of Oktikheion, the greatest naval power in the Kheionai World, sailed beyond the horizon. Nearing bankruptcy due to the loss of Althungoti's gold, the imposing Degárikes that broke Ormam's hegemony, surrounded by scores of triremes and transport ships, made for Amadia, hoping to win back the riches that once built their fleet.\n\n10 years later, a single ship returned. The expeditionary army had been broken in the wilds of the north, and the fleet scoured by a stray Deathwind. Oktikheion was ruined, their women and children left wailing in the streets for the husbands, fathers, brothers and sons who would never return. But in the rest of the Kheionai, treasurers and naval planners alike breathed a sigh of relief - Oktikheion's dreaded fleet, its titanic Degárikes in particular, lay at the bottom of the ocean. Why, then, must they try to match them? The cities of Alecand scaled back their naval spending, laid their Degárikes to rest - most were scrapped for wood and metal.\n\nBut the tide has turned once more. Kimanis has fallen. The Nékhei of Amgremós, cut loose and adrift, has turned to the pirates of the Cleaved Sea for protection, who now use their harbour to prey on the ships bringing the riches of Taychend back to Kheionai shores. And, of course, with Oktikheion's green flying over Kimánis' Silken-Harbour, the fears of a naval resurgence mount, and whispers abound of Oktíbhen engineers digging into their archives for old plans and schematics. Many wonder: perhaps it is time to dig up old plans of our own?"
 kheionai.30.a:0 "The Cleaved Sea is not safe…" 
 
 kheionai.31.t:0 "Titans of the Seas" 
 kheionai.31.d:0 "Ardores, one of the richest pirates in the Cleaved Sea, commander of a full fleet of triremes and captain of the Kraken's Dread, was awoken from his slumber by a call from outside. There was commotion as the ship began to turn, though he had ordered no such manoeuvre. When Ardores rushed to the deck, he saw his entire fleet at battlestations, sails drawn down and oars pushed out. Soon enough, he saw why - there was a single ship on the horizon, barrelling towards them. He saw a group of small dots spring from its decks and draw closer.\n\n“ARTILLERY!” Ardores called, as he made for the helm. A few seconds later, the boulder-like shot whizzed past, missing his own ship but striking some of the others under his command. He watched as the stones pierced decks, turned pirates and sailors to bloody ruins. Ships drifted as their oarsmen faltered, and the fleet slowed, confused. Even as its artillery fired, though, the enemy vessel kept its course, straight for the Kraken's Dread. One ship against a fleet - but it was no normal ship. It was a Degárikes.\n\n“It's going to ram us…” the pirate-captain realised, as he paled. His first mate tugged at him, begging for orders, but Ardores simply stared at his nearing doom. It was massive, taller than two triremes atop each other, and with a ram like a kraken's beak. A force of nature not seen in decades, since the disaster beyond the Kaydhano. Sailors abandoned ship as the Degárikes approached, then made contact. The Kraken's Dread gave an ear-shattering scream as wood splintered, then snapped. The force of the ship falling apart threw Ardores backwards. The Degárikes cleaved through and kept going.\n\nArdores watched in disbelief as the Degárikes tore his fleet apart. The artillery on board kept firing, turning fleeing ships into shattered splinters as archers rained arrowfire from up high on any unlucky pirates still living. Marines rappelled down the decks, ready to haul what cargo they could from the wrecks and finish off any stragglers. The Degárikes were back - may all its enemies beware."
 kheionai.31.a:0 "[Root.GetName] shall rule the waves!" 
 
 kheionai.32.t:0 "Plans for Degárikes Found" 
 kheionai.32.d.b:0 "The Degárikes of the Kheionai are masterworks of naval engineering, titanic vessels that can hold rows of heavy artillery on their decks, as well as a massive complement of archers and marines. Dreaded throughout the known world, they have been in use for centuries, most famously used by Oktikheion to contest Ormam's naval hegemony in the Great Sea Wars of the 10th and 11th centuries. Though they experienced a dark period in the early 1400s, as the loss of Oktikheion's formidable fleet in the Second Amadian Expedition led to their disuse, recent conflict in the Cleaved Sea has led to their revival.\n\n[Root.GetDegarikesDesc]\n\nIn terms of construction, valuable information from our conquered Kheionai territories has more or less revealed the secrets to Degárikes construction - soon, our engineers believe they will be able to begin building our own vessels. Unfortunately, the Degárikes require large and specialised harbours, and there are few ports outside Kheionai lands in which they can be built and docked - if we are to expand our fleet of Degárikes, we must conquer more Kheionai Shipyards."

 kheionai.32.d.k:0 "[Root.GetDegarikesDesc]\n\nThe Degárikes are so massive that they require specialised harbours and shipyards in which they can be first constructed, and then safely docked once they're complete. Apart from the obvious problem of draining a suitable drydock for hull repairs and retrofits - and when you're dealing with a wooden ship, unwarded, longer than two krakens laid side-by-side, there WILL be repairs and retrofits - an unsheltered Degárikos is liable to be literally torn apart if caught in a storm. Only our people have made these modifications - if we are to increase the size of our fleet, we will need to seize more Kheionai Shipyards."
