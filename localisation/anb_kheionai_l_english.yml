 kheionai.0.t:0 "The Death Winds"
 kheionai.0.d:0 "A rural mother tucks her children into bed and makes them recite their evacuation plans, the same as her mother made her do before her first Death Wind. A sailor out to sea holds his head in his hands, knowing he's too far out to sea to return home, and the magical tumors will ensure he never sees his wife again. A philosopher on Alecand stares at the hateful blue dust clouds on the horizon, content the purpose-built architecture and magical Windwards will protect him and his kheion.\n\nOverexposure to any kind of suffering will numb you to it. That's what the Kheionai tell themselves. You can only cower in fear for so long. And the Kheionai have lived in the Death Wind's malignant shadow for as long as there have been Kheionai: a great storm of poisonous blue sand from the Kaydhano Sea, carrying wicked magic that inflicts lethal cancers upon all exposed. It cannot be avoided. It cannot be stopped. All you can do is hope you can seek shelter in time. Life grinds to a halt as the Death Winds strip the soil and mutilate flesh. It suffocates a nation like a smothered infant.\n\nThe Kheionai have learned how to prepare for the inevitable as best they can. There simply isn't any other choice. So long as the Kheionai maintain their fragile Windwards, their young civilization may yet survive."
 kheionai.0.a:0 "The mages predict the next storm in one year."

 kheionai.1:0 "Death Wind"
 kheionai.1.t:0 "The Azure Death Comes"
 kheionai.1.d:0 "Word comes from the north, carried by the brave and foolhardy who venture those waters - the Kaydhano stirs. The winds again sweep that great poisoned waste, stirring the desert’s life-stealing sands, and soon enough they will whip south to ravage Alecand. Already the news spreads like wildfire throughout the kheions and into the countryside, and those who dare to live beyond the Windwards are making preparations to move into the cities to weather the storms. Over the coming weeks, all life begins to revolve around preparation for the Death Winds, and normal economic activity slows down as people focus on surviving the worst."
 kheionai.1.a:0 "The Death Wind will be upon us soon."

 kheionai.5.t:0 "Windwards Sabotaged!"
 kheionai.5.d:0 "The Windwards that surround the kheions are durable and mighty, capable of withstanding some of the most devastating physical and magical bombardments of Halann. They are also, to those who understand them, very fragile, and the removal or damage of just one or two components can defeat their protective measures and leave large sections of a kheion unwarded.\n\nBecause of their value and vulnerability, the windwards are always a target. Recently, our soldiers have captured saboteurs attempting to damage our protections! We presume they have been sent by our rivals to ensure we are weakened by the deathwinds when next they come - we will have to deal with them in force to punish them for such an underhanded and duplicitous trespass."
 kheionai.5.a:0 "Bastards!"

 kheionai.6.t:0 "A New People?"

 kheionai.7.a:0 "Okay."

 kheionai.8.t:0 "The Quiet After the Storm"
 kheionai.8.d:0 "After many years the Deathwinds have subsided, the great winds shifting away from the northeast and carrying only the smell of sea salt and mountain air on the breeze. A week of rejoicing reigns in the kheions, folk from all walks of life celebrating another ordeal endured. Slowly the people begin to trickle out of the cities - returning to farms and outlying fields to rebuild, boarding ships as envoys, fishermen, or traders, or even wandering simply for the sake of leaving the confines in which they have been so long imprisoned. Life returns to normal - as normal as it is in Alecand - for a time, and we would do well to seize this opportunity to look beyond our borders again."
 kheionai.8.a:0 "The Death Wind is over."

 kheionai.9.t:0 "The Storm"
 kheionai.9.d:0 "As always, it came upon the land slowly, the winds shifting to blow from the northeast. The first winds whisked along small flecks of blue, little more than a whisper of doom to the untrained eye. But the first flecks were followed soon after by ever more intense winds carrying azure death, the poison sands blighting the ground and spreading sickness wherever they land, the air itself becoming a herald of cancer and contagion. The terrible days have come again to Alecand, those winds of death ready to wipe the land clean and steal the lives of any not sheltered behind the Windwards. The cities are filled to bursting with refugees, the granaries are stocked full and rationed tightly as we wait out the Kaydhano’s wrath."
 kheionai.9.a:0 "The Death Wind is here."

 kheionai.12.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.12.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand. These peoples now identify more strongly with their nékhei than the parent city that may rule over them. From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.12.a: "We forge our own path now!"

 kheionai.14.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.14.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand. These peoples now identify more strongly with their nékhei than the parent city that may rule over them. From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.14.a: "As long as they still bend the knee"
