 kheionai.0.t:0 "The Death Winds"
 kheionai.0.d:0 "A rural mother tucks her children into bed and makes them recite their evacuation plans, the same as her mother made her do before her first Death Wind. A sailor out to sea holds his head in his hands, knowing he's too far out to sea to return home, and the magical tumors will ensure he never sees his wife again. A philosopher on Alecand stares at the hateful blue dust clouds on the horizon, content the purpose-built architecture and magical Windwards will protect him and his kheion.\n\nOverexposure to any kind of suffering will numb you to it. That's what the Kheionai tell themselves. You can only cower in fear for so long. And the Kheionai have lived in the Death Wind's malignant shadow for as long as there have been Kheionai: a great storm of poisonous blue sand from the Kaydhano Sea, carrying wicked magic that inflicts lethal cancers upon all exposed. It cannot be avoided. It cannot be stopped. All you can do is hope you can seek shelter in time. Life grinds to a halt as the Death Winds strip the soil and mutilate flesh. It suffocates a nation like a smothered infant.\n\nThe Kheionai have learned how to prepare for the inevitable as best they can. There simply isn't any other choice. So long as the Kheionai maintain their fragile Windwards, their young civilization may yet survive."
 kheionai.0.a:0 "The mages predict the next storm in one year."

 kheionai.1:0 "Death Wind"
 kheionai.1.t:0 "The Azure Death Comes"
 kheionai.1.d:0 "Word comes from the north, carried by the brave and foolhardy who venture those waters - the Kaydhano stirs. The winds again sweep that great poisoned waste, stirring the desert’s life-stealing sands, and soon enough they will whip south to ravage Alecand. Already the news spreads like wildfire throughout the kheions and into the countryside, and those who dare to live beyond the Windwards are making preparations to move into the cities to weather the storms. Over the coming weeks, all life begins to revolve around preparation for the Death Winds, and normal economic activity slows down as people focus on surviving the worst."
 kheionai.1.a:0 "The Death Wind will be upon us soon."

 kheionai.2.t:0 "Fort Wards"
 kheionai.2.d:0 "Helper Event"
 kheionai.2.a:0 "Okay"
 kheionai.3.t:0 "Mage Tower Wards"
 kheionai.3.d:0 "Helper Event"
 kheionai.3.a:0 "Okay"
 kheionai.4.t:0 "Development Wards"
 kheionai.4.d:0 "Helper Event"
 kheionai.4.a:0 "Okay"

 kheionai.5.t:0 "Windwards Sabotaged!"
 kheionai.5.d:0 "The Windwards that surround the kheions are durable and mighty, capable of withstanding some of the most devastating physical and magical bombardments of Halann. They are also, to those who understand them, very fragile, and the removal or damage of just one or two components can defeat their protective measures and leave large sections of a kheion unwarded.\n\nBecause of their value and vulnerability, the windwards are always a target. Recently, our soldiers have captured saboteurs attempting to damage our protections! We presume they have been sent by our rivals to ensure we are weakened by the deathwinds when next they come - we will have to deal with them in force to punish them for such an underhanded and duplicitous trespass."
 kheionai.5.a:0 "Bastards!"

 kheionai.6.t:0 "A New People?"
 kheionai.6.d:0 "For years now we have lost the ties to our Alecandi overlords, as time passes people change and some no longer consider us to be the same as our cousins that never left the island."
 kheionai.6.a:0 "We are Alecandi no longer!"
 kheionai.6.b:0 "We are still of the blood of Alecand!"

 kheionai.7.t:0 "Temporary Ward Damage Removed"
 kheionai.7.d:0 "Helper Event"
 kheionai.7.a:0 "Okay."

 kheionai.8.t:0 "The Quiet After the Storm"
 kheionai.8.d:0 "After many years the Deathwinds have subsided, the great winds shifting away from the northeast and carrying only the smell of sea salt and mountain air on the breeze. A week of rejoicing reigns in the kheions, folk from all walks of life celebrating another ordeal endured. Slowly the people begin to trickle out of the cities - returning to farms and outlying fields to rebuild, boarding ships as envoys, fishermen, or traders, or even wandering simply for the sake of leaving the confines in which they have been so long imprisoned. Life returns to normal - as normal as it is in Alecand - for a time, and we would do well to seize this opportunity to look beyond our borders again."
 kheionai.8.a:0 "The Death Wind is over."

 kheionai.9.t:0 "The Storm"
 kheionai.9.d:0 "As always, it came upon the land slowly, the winds shifting to blow from the northeast. The first winds whisked along small flecks of blue, little more than a whisper of doom to the untrained eye. But the first flecks were followed soon after by ever more intense winds carrying azure death, the poison sands blighting the ground and spreading sickness wherever they land, the air itself becoming a herald of cancer and contagion. The terrible days have come again to Alecand, those winds of death ready to wipe the land clean and steal the lives of any not sheltered behind the Windwards. The cities are filled to bursting with refugees, the granaries are stocked full and rationed tightly as we wait out the Kaydhano’s wrath."
 kheionai.9.a:0 "The Death Wind is here."

 kheionai.12.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.12.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand. These peoples now identify more strongly with their nékhei than the parent city that may rule over them. From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.12.a: "We forge our own path now!"

 kheionai.14.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.14.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand. These peoples now identify more strongly with their nékhei than the parent city that may rule over them. From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.14.a: "As long as they still bend the knee"

 kheionai.16.t: "Growth of our Nékheis"
 kheionai.16.d: "Due to the steady growth of our nékheis, we are now able to pull more trade from them and the mainland for us."
 kheionai.16.a: "Let's hope they don't get any ideas"

 kheionai.17.t: "Growth of our Country"
 kheionai.17.d: "Due to our steady growth we are now able to put more resources into our colonization efforts, while our Alecandi overlord reaps more benefits to their trade."
 kheionai.17.a: "Perhaps it's time to forge our own path..."

 kheionai.18.t: "A New Subject"
 kheionai.18.desc: "While we were expanding we managed to get control over a country, what should we do with it?"
 kheionai.18.a: "Proclaim them our vassal"
 kheionai.18.b: "Let them keep some of their autonomy"
 kheionai.18.c: "Free them, they're not worth the effort"
 kheionai.18.dd: "Integrate them into our other Nékheis"

 kheionai.19.t: "[From.GetName] Requests War Rights"
 kheionai.19.d: "Today our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] got a letter from [From.GetName] requesting the right to go to war. While this would help our colonization of the mainland, it will also hurt our trade until the war has finished and if they get too big they might start thinking about independence."
 kheionai.19.a: "Grant War Rights"
 kheionai.19.b: "Refuse the Request"

 kheionai.20.t: "War Rights Granted"
 kheionai.20.d: "Our diplomat has come back to us with great news, [From.GetName] has accepted our request for war rights! We can now declare one war for the next 5 years."
 kheionai.20.a: "Prepare the Troops!"

 kheionai.21.t: "War Rights Denied"
 kheionai.21.d: "Our diplomat has come back to us with bad news, [From.GetName] has refused our request for war rights!"
 kheionai.21.a: "Maybe we should go our own path then"

 kheionai_flavour.1.t: "The Hounds of Askovoinos"
 kheionai_flavour.1.d: "Since the Kheion first fell in 1441, assaulted on two sides by Oktíkheion and Degakheion, the Kimabhen have been restless, with frequent riots breaking out in the city. At the year’s Askovoinos festival, celebrated when the new vintage comes in, the diluted wine that is normally used in the feasts was secretly replaced with undiluted wine – with the mobs of Kimanis stirred into a drunken stupor, they massacred our garrison and any of our people still inside the city.

 kheionai_flavour.19.t: "Wild Wild Magic"
 kheionai_flavour.19.d: "A brave merchant returns to the capital from his voyage to Amadia with a group of paleskinned tall ruinborn onboard with peculiar scars, until now being mostly a subject of sailors' stories and rumours. Captain, certainly an eccentric man, refuses to sail someplace else, declaring said amadians to be the finest crew he's ever had. Most people urge to drive amadians away from the walls of our kheonai immediately and under no circumstances let them in! Some other people are impressed by captain's defiance, saying it would be uncivilized to deny hospitality to such unusual guests."
 kheionai_flavour.19.a: "We cannot risk wild magic shenanigans. Unfortunately, the captain and his unusual crew must go."
 kheionai_flavour.19.b: "We can't just refuse the captain's goods, and his people are welcome to stay and visit our capital until their next voyage, however, we must keep an eye on them."

 kheionai_flavour.21.t: "Too close for Comfort"
 kheionai_flavour.21.d: "People experience overpopulation in our urban areas because everyone wants to live in proximity to windwards. The process of renovation won't go smoothly because some people have to be evicted as their housing won't fit the planning."
 kheionai_flavour.21.a: "Clearly some renovation plans are in order. "
 kheionai_flavour.21.b: "Refugees from a countryside will have to get comfortable in the streets next time."

 kheionai_flavour.22.d: "Kheonai militia has occupied one of the passages to the Metei because its location is well suited to be a shelter from deathwinds. A local eltibhen chief is extremely displeased."
 kheionai_flavour.22.a: "Don't they understand they will get to use this shelter too?"
 kheionai_flavour.22.b: "It would be an ethically correct thing to respect the local beliefs for the time being. Order the militias to step down."
 kheionai_flavour.22.c: "If they don't like our militia, they are welcomed to move somewhere else."

 kheionai_flavour.23.t: "To Serve or to Protect?"
 kheionai_flavour.23.d: "He, who has a mighty army, is capable of protecting his kheion and his nekheis. The most recent proposal in our government has stirred our capital up. People are arguing in favor of neglecting nekheis military funding in favor of our levies, however, some groups of interest clearly aligned with nekheis are demanding to expand our military presence in Devand and allocate additional funding to our nekheis."
 kheionai_flavour.23.a: "Favor Alecand military."
 kheionai_flavour.23.b: "Expand Nekheis military presence in Devand."
 kheionai_flavour.23.c: "Military is a joint effort and there could be no room for negotiation."

 kheionai_flavour.24.t: "The Legend of Seven Seas"
 kheionai_flavour.24.d: "A crowd is gathering in the port near one of the merchant ship returned from his voyage past the Cleaved Sea.\n\n— Hear ye, my friends, for my latest voyage to the lands beyond the Amadian Coast known as Haraf was unlike anything I've experienced before. The legends of the land are true, and I have stories that will make your hearts and minds race, and all mine goods are the testament of my story.\n— This one is better be good.\n— As we sailed through the treacherous landscape, our ship was stranded and we were attacked by a mighty sand worm during our stay on shores! Oh my dear crowd, we barely survived that encounter.\n— Didn't you notice how he elaborately skipped the part of how exactly did they survive?\n— A giant worm, attacking a ship close to the shore? I don't buy this.\n— Later on your journey to the west we had to make a camp. And we were attacked by creepy deformed tall creatures reminding us! But their skin was dark purple and their eyes were glowing inside the jungles, as they kept advancing on our perimeter.\n— I've heard that one before. Our explorers have reported such creatures indeed.\n— Except the reports stated a total lack of hostility from them.\n— When all the hope was lost, we noticed the groups of strange outsiders joining the battle. One quickly would notice their pale masks, looking like the faces of the beasts we were fighting. We realized we were saved! Indeed, they are making their masks from the faces of slain creatures. They even taught me how to make one, look, here it is!\n— Meaning he just plundered their settlement.\n— What a lowlife.\n— And as a token of good will, I decided to donate a good portion of my profits to our beloved kheion where I was born and raised! Praised be its leaders!\n\n— The report is on your table. Awaiting for your instructions.""
 kheionai_flavour.24.a: ""Regardless of his story, this donation is most certainly welcomed.""

 kheionai_flavour.24.c: ""His tales are not half bad for a privateer scum. Make this official.""

 kheionai_flavour.25.t: "Inept Philosophers"
 kheionai_flavour.25.d: "Our philosopher contemporaries are failing at producing anything of meaning or value. Their speeches no longer captivate the crowd, their schools don't accept as much students as they used to. It is evident even amongst the ochlos that dark times are upon us."
 kheionai_flavour.25.a: "Our culture has clearly fallen."
 kheionai_flavour.25.b: "Anyone studying histories knows such small failings are temporary."

 kheionai_flavour.26.t: "Akratos"
 kheionai_flavour.26.d: "Strange things are happening during this year's festival in Kimanis. Our local militia commander had drunk himself on Kimanis wine to the point he rode his chariot into a local school multiple times. His subordinates act no better, we have multiple reports of them disturbing the civilians peace: using windows as a target practice, falling off the ledges, harassing the merchants, all of this in a drunken stupor state. Rumours say certain sinister figures may be behind all this, but it's hard to confirm or deny since kimabhen local population had become a drunken unruly crowd too, and it seems Kimanis will be totally out of control if we do not act soon enough."
 kheionai_flavour.26.a: "Interrupt the ongoing chaos by all the means necessary."

 kheionai_flavour.27.d: "All the efforts of cooperation between us and nekheis are falling flat recently. Every our decision either meets outright backlash or fulfill to a degree where it almost feels like a sabotage by the local governors. The reality is - we don't have points of connection with our nekheis anymore."

 kheionai_flavour.28.d: "A local powerful aristocrat is on his way to become possibly the richest man in the known world. With his wealth he's gaining a taste of influencing the politics of our Kheinisi, advocating for bolstering the executive powers of Kylakas and gathering his support amongst the common folks. Even more, the rumors say he has ambitions to become the next Kylakas himself! Could it be possible this man is about to bring the rule of tyranny to us?"
 kheionai_flavour.28.a: "Surely one man can't undermine our political traditions..."
 kheionai_flavour.28.b: "We MUST know what he's up to!"

 kheionai_flavour.29.t: "Investigation Results"
 kheionai_flavour.29.d: "My Kylakas, our spies we have sent to investigate the actions of that man have been caught infiltrating his villa. The wannabe tyrant is very angry and his supporters are on the march to topple us, claiming we have violated their civil rights! At least we forced them to act prematurely..."
 kheionai_flavour.29.a: "Disperse the rabble."

 kheionai_flavour.30.t: "Grand Feast"
 kheionai_flavour.30.d: "My Kylakas, a most hilarious thing happened recently. Yesterday, the wannabe tyrant was hosting a grand banquet for his supporters before marching on our capital. However, this was the last banquet for him, as he choked on a boar leg! This man's greed truly knew no bounds."
 kheionai_flavour.30.a: "He simply was not destined to rule."

 kheionai_flavour.31.t: "The Tyrant Acts!"
 kheionai_flavour.31.d: "My Kylakas, our decision to ignore the wannabe tyrant turned out to be a huge blunder! He managed to gather an army of mercenaries, pirates and even some aristocrats are supporting him! This is a huge crisis..."
 kheionai_flavour.31.a: "How did we miss that??"

 degarikes_taychendi:0 "Though we have not always been seafaring people - even the Thekrystana, who rely on the water for their wealth, are ill at ease on the open ocean - one look at these ships is all it takes to know of their glory. Imagine an entire fleet of them, terrorising the seas and projecting Taychendi power across the waves! And with the secrets of the Slaver-Nobles beneath our feet, one wonders just how big these ships can get..."
 degarikes_eltibhari:0 "Though we may have achieved dominance over the island of Alecand itself, the Kheionai maintained an extensive maritime empire. With an endless expanse of open ocean to our shores, we have never truly been able to grasp naval combat - now, if we are to expand our Riei's domain further, we must master it. Thankfully, we can turn to our new territories to do so."

 degarikes_devandi:0 "The Chendhyan lake-pirates of the Taras'su Ervan made a habit of boarding trading vessels and unleashing their feline mounts on the unprepared sailors. Though we may not have the maritime traditions of the Kheionai, a distinct possibility arises when looking at their titanic vessels - they seem to be big enough to hold a large number of mounts at any one time, and they certainly have the armour to plunge into an enemy fleet and not be destroyed. Maybe it is time to let the open oceans know the terror a jaguar-rider can bring?"
 degarikes_oktikheion:0 "When we lost our fleet and our army north of the Kaydhano, we were forced to downsize our navy dramatically, our coffers exhausted. It took decades for our city's population to recover, and only after the seizure of Kimánis could we begin to prepare our naval resurgence, and begin to build more Degárikes. But over 50 years had passed since any of our engineers had laid eyes on them - it was a long and arduous process, even with the extensive plans already in our possession. We were not the first to bring back these ships, but we will not be the last. Our engineers have now made all the necessary preparations, and we can begin rebuilding our fleet at once."
 degarikes_kheionai:0 "When Oktikheion blundered their entire fleet and a quarter of their male population into a watery grave, the Degárikes, titanic in size and power, but expensive to build and maintain, nearly died with it. Oktikheion had long forced the other Kheions into a naval arms race in which they did not want to participate - when the biggest player was forced out of the game, the others raced to see who could withdraw the fastest. Now, with the world growing more dangerous, the need for these titanic ships once more grows. We were not the first to reintroduce them, but that will not deter us - our engineers have dusted off old naval plans, and we will soon begin construction."

 kheionai.30.t:0 "New Threats on the Seas" 
 kheionai.30.d:0 "In 1397, the fleet of Oktikheion, the greatest naval power in the Kheionai World, sailed beyond the horizon. Nearing bankruptcy due to the loss of Althungoti's gold, the imposing Degárikes that broke Ormam's hegemony, surrounded by scores of triremes and transport ships, made for Amadia, hoping to win back the riches that once built their fleet.\n\n10 years later, a single ship returned. The expeditionary army had been broken in the wilds of the north, and the fleet scoured by a stray Deathwind. Oktikheion was ruined, their women and children left wailing in the streets for the husbands, fathers, brothers and sons who would never return. But in the rest of the Kheionai, treasurers and naval planners alike breathed a sigh of relief - Oktikheion's dreaded fleet, its titanic Degárikes in particular, lay at the bottom of the ocean. Why, then, must they try to match them? The cities of Alecand scaled back their naval spending, laid their Degárikes to rest - most were scrapped for wood and metal.\n\nBut the tide has turned once more. Kimanis has fallen. The Nékhei of Amgremós, cut loose and adrift, has turned to the pirates of the Cleaved Sea for protection, who now use their harbour to prey on the ships bringing the riches of Taychend back to Kheionai shores. And, of course, with Oktikheion's green flying over Kimánis' Silken-Harbour, the fears of a naval resurgence mount, and whispers abound of Oktíbhen engineers digging into their archives for old plans and schematics. Many wonder: perhaps it is time to dig up old plans of our own?"
 kheionai.30.a:0 "The Cleaved Sea is not safe…" 
 
 kheionai.31.t:0 "Titans of the Seas" 
 kheionai.31.d:0 "Ardores, one of the richest pirates in the Cleaved Sea, commander of a full fleet of triremes and captain of the Kraken's Dread, was awoken from his slumber by a call from outside. There was commotion as the ship began to turn, though he had ordered no such manoeuvre. When Ardores rushed to the deck, he saw his entire fleet at battlestations, sails drawn down and oars pushed out. Soon enough, he saw why - there was a single ship on the horizon, barrelling towards them. He saw a group of small dots spring from its decks and draw closer.\n\n“ARTILLERY!” Ardores called, as he made for the helm. A few seconds later, the boulder-like shot whizzed past, missing his own ship but striking some of the others under his command. He watched as the stones pierced decks, turned pirates and sailors to bloody ruins. Ships drifted as their oarsmen faltered, and the fleet slowed, confused. Even as its artillery fired, though, the enemy vessel kept its course, straight for the Kraken's Dread. One ship against a fleet - but it was no normal ship. It was a Degárikes.\n\n“It's going to ram us…” the pirate-captain realised, as he paled. His first mate tugged at him, begging for orders, but Ardores simply stared at his nearing doom. It was massive, taller than two triremes atop each other, and with a ram like a kraken's beak. A force of nature not seen in decades, since the disaster beyond the Kaydhano. Sailors abandoned ship as the Degárikes approached, then made contact. The Kraken's Dread gave an ear-shattering scream as wood splintered, then snapped. The force of the ship falling apart threw Ardores backwards. The Degárikes cleaved through and kept going.\n\nArdores watched in disbelief as the Degárikes tore his fleet apart. The artillery on board kept firing, turning fleeing ships into shattered splinters as archers rained arrowfire from up high on any unlucky pirates still living. Marines rappelled down the decks, ready to haul what cargo they could from the wrecks and finish off any stragglers. The Degárikes were back - may all its enemies beware."
 kheionai.31.a:0 "[Root.GetName] shall rule the waves!" 
 
 kheionai.32.t:0 "Plans for Degárikes Found" 
 kheionai.32.d.b:0 "The Degárikes of the Kheionai are masterworks of naval engineering, titanic vessels that can hold rows of heavy artillery on their decks, as well as a massive complement of archers and marines. Dreaded throughout the known world, they have been in use for centuries, most famously used by Oktikheion to contest Ormam's naval hegemony in the Great Sea Wars of the 10th and 11th centuries. Though they experienced a dark period in the early 1400s, as the loss of Oktikheion's formidable fleet in the Second Amadian Expedition led to their disuse, recent conflict in the Cleaved Sea has led to their revival.\n\n[Root.GetDegarikesDesc]\n\nIn terms of construction, valuable information from our conquered Kheionai territories has more or less revealed the secrets to Degárikes construction - soon, our engineers believe they will be able to begin building our own vessels. Unfortunately, the Degárikes require large and specialised harbours, and there are few ports outside Kheionai lands in which they can be built and docked - if we are to expand our fleet of Degárikes, we must conquer more Kheionai Shipyards."

 kheionai.32.d.k:0 "[Root.GetDegarikesDesc]\n\nThe Degárikes are so massive that they require specialised harbours and shipyards in which they can be first constructed, and then safely docked once they're complete. Apart from the obvious problem of draining a suitable drydock for hull repairs and retrofits - and when you're dealing with a wooden ship, unwarded, longer than two krakens laid side-by-side, there WILL be repairs and retrofits - an unsheltered Degárikos is liable to be literally torn apart if caught in a storm. Only our people have made these modifications - if we are to increase the size of our fleet, we will need to seize more Kheionai Shipyards."

 kheionai.32.b:0 "We shall match the ships of the Slaver-Nobles once more!"
