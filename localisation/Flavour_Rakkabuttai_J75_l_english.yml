 J75_bringing_retribution_title:0 "Rage and Retribution"
 J75_bringing_retribution_desc:0 "Assakadail is the most holy site for the Chendhyans, home to the Askalyn, the shelter of the so-called “hero” Munakles. This sacred isle serves as the beating heart of the Chendhyan belief in “freedom” and “liberty” that inspired them to burn half of Taychend to the ground all those years ago. Once we seize this place, its fate is sealed.\n\nRetribution awaits, and not just for the shamans and lorekeepers of Assakadail who keep the records of the Chendhyans’ sordid history. The Brotherhood has devised a plan to finally extract our due recompense for the crimes the cat-riders have committed."

 J75_port_for_the_chained_title:0 "The Southern Link"
 J75_port_for_the_chained_desc:0 "Unlike Kannagarendi, Rakkabuttai was not founded solely to capitalise on the lucrative Guaraddhi slave trade, which sees captured Chendhyans – defeated in battle or taken in slave raids – sent east in great quantities. Nonetheless, we Bloodcloaks have gained a reputation for being avid protectors of the dark practice, guarding Yodhanpir or Clematari slave caravans as they take their elven cargo east and north to Taychend or west to the Kheionai.\n\nHowever, one port has remained steadfastly closed to our traders – Oremvand. With the city’s military comprised of Taychendized Chendhyan mercenaries, who nonetheless do not countenance the enslavement of their kin, Oremvand has instead relied on raids against Mteibhar, Ameion or other Taychendi states to replenish their stocks. No longer. With the city open to us, and Chendhyan power in the city broken, we can finally open up the southern link in our trade network."

 J75_sieze_the_plains_title:0 "Seize the Steppes"
 J75_sieze_the_plains_desc:0 "For nearly half a century, Zaernsarlan the Ravager has dominated the steppe, pushing the Bloodcloaks to the very walls of their capital. And with Oremvand and their Haebysziae “allies” too weak to do anything about him either, the entire Guaraddhi is at risk of falling to Zaernmaera’s advance. If we are to secure the future of both the Brotherhood and Taychend, we must throw everything we have at the Chendhyan menace, and eliminate the threat of Haenbuddar once and for all."

 J75_rebuilding_kannagarendi_title:0 "The Prodigal Brother"
 J75_rebuilding_kannagarendi_desc:0 "Kannagarendi used to be our counterpart on the Guaraddhi – ran by a coalition of Yodhanpri slavers and remnants of the Ironblood garrison from the days of the Second Gophiran Empire, it controlled the middle steppes between us and Oremvand, seizing many Chendhyans and sending them east. But they lacked our discipline and focus, content to waste money on luxuries, and eventually Zaernsarlan the Ravager put an end to their power, sacking the city and reducing it to a shadow of its former self. It is time we brought the city back under our control, restored Kannagarendi to its former glory, and welcomed back our prodigal brother on the steppe."

 J75_maintaining_chains_title:0 "The Western Pillar"
 J75_maintaining_chains_desc:0 "Naturally, our actions against the Chendhyans have angered them. Both the tribes in the Guaraddhi and our vassals in the Chendhya proper are increasingly rebellious, unwilling to abide by our new restrictions and taxes – this cannot stand. If we are to remain the western pillar of Taychendi civilisation, then we must reforge and redouble the chains that bind our enemies to us."

 J75_trade_moving_east_title:0 "Commercial Retribution"
 J75_trade_moving_east_desc:0 "Subjugation leads to suppression. Suppression leads to resistance. Resistance leads to warfare. Warfare leads to captives. And how could we call ourselves dedicated to the cause if we did not capitalise on every possible advantage? And so captives turn to slaves. And slaves go east. Retribution commercialised – and it is time to expand on our investments."

 J75_revitilization_of_cloaks_title:0 "The Sacred Mission"
 J75_revitilization_of_cloaks_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak has grown too fond of the bitterness of defeat. Surrounded on all sides by Chendhyan forces powerful enough to match Bloodcloak armies, Rakkabuttai is at risk of failing in its most sacred mission – to defend Taychend from the Chendhyan threat. If we are to avoid such a fate, then the Brotherhood must be revitalised and reinforced."

 J75_expand_our_role_title:0 "Bulwark of the Guaraddhi"
 J75_expand_our_role_desc:0 "In the half-millennium since Rakkabuttai’s founding, the Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak has sought to bring order and stability to the steppe, cracking down on the Chendhyans who disturb the peace. Now, finally, it seems we are on the precipice of completing that long-standing goal. But when the Guaraddhi finally falls under our control, it may become necessary to ask a question the Brotherhood has not yet considered – what next?"

 J75_centralize_the_west_title:0 "Under a Bloody Cloak"
 J75_centralize_the_west_desc:0 "Taychend has fallen into an ever deepening era of chaos and uncertainty since the fall of the Second Gophiran Empire, and nowhere is this more evident than the western regions. With the kingdoms of the Larankarha consumed by war and Imarchend descending into vice and stagnation, the traditional pillars of the west are in a dangerous position. In order to save Taychend, we must take these regions under our Bloody Cloak – and, as a bonus, we may be able to take some of the destitute farmers of the region and move them into our own territory, allowing us to tighten the grip on our lands even further."

 J75_pushing_back_the_invaders_title:0 "Pushing Back the Invaders"
 J75_pushing_back_the_invaders_desc:0 "Strangely enough, at least to many Taychendi back east, the Brotherhood have always somewhat respected the Ambhen. They had, after all, fought against the Chendhyan menace for centuries before our founding, and done so rather successfully. But we cannot abide by the efforts of Laskaris and his successors to divide and devastate our home – and so we must cast them out, alongside every other new threat to Taychend’s security. Let us drive back the invaders from our shores, and break bread in a free and Taychendi Anakalnakori!"

 J75_recruiting_into_our_ranks_title:0 "Sabre and Steel"
 J75_recruiting_into_our_ranks_desc:0 "Rakkabuttai is on the very edge of Taychendi civilisation – it is thus no wonder there are so few who brave the journey to the west in order to join the ranks of the Bloodcloaks. Therefore, it is necessary for us to increase our efforts in recruiting new members within our own lands. By drilling these new soldiers relentlessly, we may even be able to finally gain the edge we need to secure our lasting ascendancy, by sabre and steel."

 J75_fortresses_about_title:0 "Wardens of Taychend"
 J75_fortresses_about_desc:0 "Since mythic times, internal strife and conflict have riven Taychend. While it has undoubtedly honed the swords and hearts of many, and surely brought to the fore the most glorious and ambitious men to have graced this world, there is no doubt that the political institutions of Taychend have left it divided, weak, ripe for foreign invaders of all kinds. We must put a stop to this: by expanding our influence and establishing new fortresses across Taychend, we can become the wardens against disorder and disunity we need to become in order to fulfil our sacred mission."

 J75_set_in_stone_title:0 "Set in Stone"
 J75_set_in_stone_desc:0 "The Chendhyans – and some of the Taychendi – see us as little more than armoured bandits. To them we are mere brigands and criminals, who use the Sacred Mission as an excuse to harass and terrorise the people of the Guaraddhi. If we are not careful, we may well prove them right. By laying out strict laws and promulgating far-reaching edicts, we can ensure the primacy and efficiency of the Bloodcloaks is all but set in stone."

 J75_training_the_cloaked_title:0 "Tempered in Blood"
 J75_training_the_cloaked_desc:0 "Since our founding four centuries ago, the Brotherhood has stood as the only thing protecting Taychend from the Chendhyan menace. With our greatsabres and heavy armour, we have cut down countless cat-riding warlords and so-called freedom fighters – but with the threats to our people increasing by the day, we must rise to match it. Our soldiers will be tempered in blood, honed into a sword sharp enough to face the threats that mount against our home!"

 J75_bringing_unity_title:0 "Brotherhood Ascendant"
 J75_bringing_unity_desc:0 "We have done it – finally unified Taychend. Our economic, political and military might is unmatched – never again shall the Chendhyans or any other threat like them invade and ransack our lands! The Brotherhood ascendant, our home shall forevermore be protected under our cloaks, stained blood red with the blood of our martyred soldiers and vanquished enemies alike!"


 #Retribution Payements
 rakkabuttai_events.1.t:0 "Rage and Retribution"
 rakkabuttai_events.1.d:0 "Vezha watched as a group of Bloodcloaks approached on their horses, red cloaks fluttering in the wind. Others in the camp had noticed too – they gathered around her as she stood in its centre, the worry making her sick to her stomach. To the north, she knew, the Askalyn burned. The shamans and lorekeepers lay slaughtered, a millennia and a half of history gone up in flames. And now their killers were here. Mothers and fathers kept their children close, Vezha’s own daughter huddling by her side.\n\nFinally, the Bloodcloaks arrived. “Hark, thieves! Raiders!” their commander called, with the usual venom, and in Yodhanpir, of course – though Vezha and a few others in the tribe could understand, with difficulty. “The Brotherhood has decided on a new course!” A murmur rose through the camp as hushed translations filtered through the crowd. “All Chendhyan tribes are to provide two weights of milk, two barrels of feed and five weights of grain! OR a cat’s head! OR two men! OR one woman! At the holdfast at Nisae!” The hushed translations stopped, their translators too shocked. “Every month!” And now too indignant.\n\nVezha stepped forwards, worry replaced with righteous anger. Her cat-mount roared, baring its teeth. “We barely have enough as is! You raid our camps, you cut our tents, you kill our animals, you assault and maim and enslave our people!” She bore the scars herself – everybody in the tribe did. “Trample our freedom and for what? By what right?”\n\n“FOR the sins of your forefathers! BY the right of Retribution!” the commander raged, unsheathing his greatsabre. “And by clemency! Bloodcloaks, to me!” He called, and at his command, his men unsheathed their swords and rode roughshod through camp. They slashed tents and bedrolls, broke pots and vases, killed livestock – it took all Vezha had to stop her people from defending themselves. Those who did were swiftly cut down. Finally, the men settled back in the square, now surrounding the Chendhyans. “Give tribute, and the raids stop! That is the price of staying our blade! The holdfast at Nisae! Every month! OR WOE! Woe forevermore–!”\n\nWith another shouted command, the Taychendi left, hooves thundering behind them. That night, the tribe settled on a cat’s head."
 rakkabuttai_events.1.a:0 "And that night, every Chendhyan on the Guaraddhi would face a similar choice."

 #Remaking our Purpose
 rakkabuttai_events.2.t:0 "Remaking Our Purpose"
 rakkabuttai_events.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] smiled as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] strode through the ruined, burning city, hands clasped behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] back, flanked by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] companions and guards. The air was thick with smoke and screams, burning cloth and wood and flesh, as the Bloodcloaks razed the settlement to the foundations. Packed tents, animal pens, cat-stables, wooden storehouses and meeting or drinking halls all went up in flames. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] halted for a moment as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] watched a few brotherhood soldiers slaughter a big cat trying desperately to defend the corpse of its former rider. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] turned to the companion closest to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lieutenant, Daratam.\n“Would you say that the Guaraddhi is secure, Daratam?” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] asked. A child’s cries pierced the air.\nThough [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] companion wore a full-face helmet, [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew when an elf was raising their eyebrow at him. “Well… of course, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. This was the last free city in the eastern plains.”\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] laughed as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] continued [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stroll through the ruined city. “Yes, yes, of course. The steppe itself is under our control. But is it secure?” The blank look beneath Daratam’s visor prompted [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to elaborate. “Would it be feasible for us to lose our grip once more, as we did after Gophira’s fall?”\nThe companion shrugged as they strode through the last embers of the carnage and destruction. “I suppose. Maybe someone from the east would attack us – the Kheionai?”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] nodded. “Yes, yes… and should we be vanquished by those attackers, as the Chendhyans have been defeated by us? What then of our sacred mission?”\n“We would–” a cry for mercy from the group’s right briefly interrupted Daratam, as he snapped his head away to inspect the source – before a swift swing of another Bloodcloak’s sword ended it. “–Die… just as that raider did just then. We would fail.”\n“Precisely!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] said, smiling. “And so with one goal completed, another reveals itself.” The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] halted once more, turning to his companion. “I think it’s time we remade our purpose. The threats to our east multiply, even as those at home dwindle. Modernisation is essential. Has it ever occurred to you, Daratam, that Taychend may be its own worst enemy?”\n\nAs a thousand tragedies played out around them, the companion laughed now too. Orphans made, sons and wives and brothers and mothers cut down. History lost in the future’s making. “If that is so, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], then it seems we have more work to do yet!”"

 #defenders of tacheyend
 rakkabuttai_events.3.t:0 "Defenders of Taychend"
 rakkabuttai_events.3.d:0 "Looking up at the statue, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could almost see the man himself. Even in stone, he had the recognisable Sangamar look – the tan skin, commanding blue eyes, hair like obsidian. This Sangamar in particular, though, was even more special. A sabre in one hand and a pair of dice in another, a cat’s head adorning each pauldron. Olhokar the Fortuitous. The original vanquisher of the Chendhyans and saviour of Taychend. Carried by fate to both the heights of success and the terrible depths of despair.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Rakkabuttai wondered when Olhokar knew he would conquer all of Taychend. Indeed he wondered when his own people had known they would do the same. When revenge against the western menace had turned to simple glorious conquest. Did he know, too, that Taychend could only withstand a second Saerraeg if it was united? [Root.Monarch.GetName] supposed it mattered not. Such a thing had been proven true regardless.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] spun on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heel and strode away, through the winding streets of Anakalnakori, until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] reached another statue, more recently built, of a clean-shaven elf wearing foreign armour. An angry rabble had gathered around it to tear the elf down, stopped only by a line of Bloodcloak soldiers. “Laskaris the Conqueror”. He had also presumed to conquer Taychend – and to change it. Mould it into the Kheionai image. Here, in Anakalnakori, he had started that mission – a sacred mission of his own, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] supposed – and now in Anakalnakori it ended.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] wondered, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] made his way through both the rabble and the Bloodcloaks, of the merits of Laskaris’ mission. A Taychend at peace, without internal conflict, division. The Ambhen did not want to raze and raid like the Chendhyans, did they? Indeed, perhaps working under their wing, the Brotherhood could have continued to protect Taychend. But a different Taychend. A Taychend that no longer was… well, Taychendi.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] laughed – that inquiry [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knew for sure no longer mattered. The crowd grew silent as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] drew [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] greatsabre, and, with a single swing, cut the statute down, steel cutting stone. The crowd cheered. If Laskaris believed the Taychendi incapable of defending themselves, he was wrong. For now, finally, the Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak had come home."
