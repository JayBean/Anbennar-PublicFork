 A46_horsemeat_delicacies_title:0 "Horsemeat Delicacies"
 A46_horsemeat_delicacies_desc:0 "The Crodamic peoples that used to inhabit the western portion of our realm have long since assimilated into Arbarani culture, however, some of their cultural particularities were kept and are still practiced today. One of these is the consumption of horsemeat, which some theorise may have originated in Crodamic rivalries with Centaurs that used to inhabit Escann before Castan Beastbane drove them out. This practice is looked down upon in disgust by many elsewhere in Cannor, however. The fools simply don't know what good food is. They may not want to buy our horsemeat pies now, but with a bit of clever rebranding, we can sell it as an exotic meat that will make everyone's mouths water."
 A46_retain_escanni_refugees_title:0 "Retain Escanni Refugees"
 A46_retain_escanni_refugees_desc:0 "Our realm was hit hard by the waves of refugees coming from Escann in the wake of the Greentide, and Freecestir has served as one of the main stopping points for refugees making their way West to Lencenor, and lately also for Adventurers and settlers returning to Escann. With such a large amount of people passing through our lands, we only need to provide the right incentives to convince at least some of them to stay and help grow our great realm."
 A46_freecestir_title:0 "Freecestir"
 A46_freecestir_desc:0 "Freecestir (Cestir meaning camp or campground in Elven) has been a settlement of great importance ever since its pivotal role in the defeat of the Sorcerer King. Lying at the crossroads between Escann and the rest of Cannor, it has served as a mustering ground for armies and adventurers in the past, and now it again serves as the main stopping point for adventurers seeking to gain glory in Escann and beyond. This has helped the settlement grow into a bustling metropolis, a centre of commerce to rival even Damescrown, far overshadowing our current capital in Arbaran. Mercenaries fill the taverns, looking for new contracts, traders constantly pass through the city carrying Gawedi furs, Telgeiran weaponry or perhaps a shipment of Orcish slaves from Escann. If we are to compete with our beloved cousins in Damescrown, we must move our capital to Freecestir."
 A46_clstc_workshops_title:0 "CLSTC Workshops"
 A46_clstc_workshops_desc:0 "The artisanry of the CLSTC is of the highest quality. We cannot dominate the markets though if the quantity produced cannot meet market demand. If we grant the Company more workshops, we will increase production of artisan goods greatly and as such we will earn a lot more in sales. After all, quantity is a quality all in its own."
 A46_challenging_damescrown_clstc_title:0 "Challenging Damescrown"
 A46_challenging_damescrown_clstc_desc:0 "Arbaran's branch of the CLSTC faces a great issue, the issue of branding. When most people think of the Company, they think of the high quality glassware, jewellry or other goods... But they also think of Damescrown. Damescrown, the greatest trade hub in all of Cannor, second only perhaps to Anbenncóst. They forget about Calascandar, the place the company was founded, about Arbaran or Freecestir. This must change. Arbaran's CLSTC must become the more influential branch, if we want to attain the glory that we are owed on the world stage."
 A46_hostile_takeover_title:0 "Hostile Takeover"
 A46_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "It took many years of scheming, purchasing of shares and marketing, but we are finally in a position where Arbaran's branch of the CLSTC nearly has a controlling interest in Damescrown. It will only take a little bit more, and we shall have all of Damescrown in our pocket. No more Crownsman meddling, no more profits going to the wrong hands; we, the house Silcalas of Arbaran, will be the only ones who decide what happens with the CLSTC, now and forever."
 A46_company_merger_title:0 "Company Merger"
 A46_company_merger_desc:0 "The city of Damescrown is now subservient to Arbaran in all but name, the time has come to put an end to the charade and assume direct control."

 A46_postwar_mobilization_title:0 "Post-War Mobilization"
 A46_postwar_mobilization_desc:0 "The Lilac Wars took a toll on the entirety of the Empire, we were, however, spared the worst of the devastation. We fought on the side of Lorent and finally overthrew those damned Silmunas, thus cementing House Silcalas' place at the top. At least for now. If we want to keep this position of power, we have to muster our men and march to secure our newly gained influence immediately."
 A46_linking_up_calascandar_title:0 "Linking Up Calascandar"
 A46_linking_up_calascandar_desc:0 "Calascandar, the greatest of Calasandur the Builder's castles! Beautiful, greatly defensible, and one of the CLSTC's main bases of operation. How the Marquis loves visiting this marvel of elven architecture with his family! However, the visits would be far more pleasant if we didn't have to pay a toll every time we want to go. Teagansfield being owned by anyone else than us is a nuisance, it slows down trade within our realm, not to mention the Company's operations. We must sweep away this annoyance at once and link up Calascandar with the rest of our realm."
 A46_fortify_calascandar_title:0 "Fortify Calascandar"
 A46_fortify_calascandar_desc:0 "Calascandar is certainly a marvel of the world, the greatest castle within all of Anbennar. Our progenitor built it after all! However, as time marches on and technology advances around us, Calascandar's defenses may not be entirely up to the challenge of new innovations such as cannon barrages. We must correct this at once, so that Calascandar may stand vigil over the Empire for a thousand years more."
 A46_secure_ainway_title:0 "Secure Ainway"
 A46_secure_ainway_desc:0 "The rest of Aranmas remains vulnerable after losing Teagansfield. The Ainway would provide us with a perfect land route down into Esmaria, which we can use to export our goods South, free from exorbitant Crownsman tolls."

 A46_clstc_artisanry_title:0 "CLSTC Artisanry"
 A46_clstc_artisanry_desc:0 "While the Vanbury Guild is lauded for its weaponry and armour, the Calasanni Trading Company has always been regarded as the greatest producer of artisan goods in all of Cannor. This is no small part thanks to our Elven friends and their great expertise. We must further support the Elven workshops to make full use of their skills."
 A46_investment_from_clstc_title:0 "CLSTC Investments"
 A46_investment_from_clstc_desc:0 "The Calasanni Trading Company is the single most influential company in Cannor, perhaps the entire world. Naturally, it is run by the scions of our great house Silcalas. These familial connections help us in many ways, and we can always count on the company to have our backs. After all, the interests of the CLSTC are the interests of Arbaran, and vice versa. So let us help out our friends in the Company, so that they may help us out in turn."
 A46_arbaran_at_sea_title:0 "Arbaran at Sea"
 A46_arbaran_at_sea_desc:0 "The Dameshead is the defining feature of all Cannor, and thus if we hope to ever be able to project our power effetively over the rest of the Empire, we must build a fleet capable of doing so. Fortunately, having secured coastal holdings, we may finally build a fleet to rival even those of Damescrown or Vertesk."
 A46_black_tower_title:0 "The Black Tower"
 A46_black_tower_desc:0 "The Citadel of Bal Vertesk towers over the Dameshead, casting its long shadow over Cannor and beyond. The city lies at the mouth of the river Alen, and controls the trade coming from the North. It is also the main hub of the Aelantiri slave trade. If we were to conquer Vertesk, our influence over the Dameshead would increase and we are sure to profit immensely."
 A46_ianrens_revenge_title:0 "Ianren's Revenge"
 A46_ianrens_revenge_desc:0 "The final defeat of Gawed was something our founders and our forefathers had dreamed about for centuries. Ianren the Rider, our great founder, died trying to subdue the treacherous Woodsmen in the Greatwoods Uprising. Leaving no clear heir, the current head of house Silcalas was elected to rule Arbaran, and our house has ruled ever since. Our animosity against Gawed has never waned, though. Finally, with the Greatwoods subdued, we can avenge our founder's death."
 A46_imperial_frontier_title:0 "Imperial Frontier"
 A46_imperial_frontier_desc:0 "As an Imperial March our task is to guard the Frontier of the Empire. We have been extremely successful in these efforts lately, as we have dealt Gawed a final defeat. With the main threat to the Northern Frontier completely annihilated, we can truly say that our task has been fulfilled. The Imperial Frontier has been pushed further North!"
 A46_harbringer_of_the_crusade_title:0 "Harbringer of the Crusade"
 A46_harbringer_of_the_crusade_desc:0 "The Crimson Deluge has wrought destruction upon Cannor, but the worst it yet to come. The Adeanic league wants to deny Corin's rightful place at the head of the Regent Court, and as long as there are those who resist, we must fight. We shall spearhead the Crusade and achieve victory for Corin's faithful!"

 A46_northern_march_title:0 "The Northern March"
 A46_northern_march_desc:0 "Since the Empire's inception, the role of the Imperial marches was to protect it from outside threats. Our main task has always been to keep Gawed in check. It is time to refurbish some of the crumbling northern forts, so that we can further fulfill this important role."
 A46_secure_the_border_title:0 "Secure the Border"
 A46_secure_the_border_desc:0 "Gawed is a great threat. The small sovereign countries that occupy the area around Derwing cannot hope to stand against it alone. We must ensure Derwing and Aramar are protected from Gawedi incursions by offering our protection in exchange for their subservience."
 A46_eclipse_gawed_title:0 "Eclipse Gawed"
 A46_eclipse_gawed_desc:0 "Oh, how the tables turn. From a small piece of Gawedi land granted to the veterans of the War of the Sorcerer King, we have grown to overshadow Gawed itself. The time has come to stop being on the defense all the time. We must be proactive now, and neutralise the Alenic threat once and for all."

 A46_legacy_of_the_free_realms_title:0 "Legacy of the Free Realms"
 A46_legacy_of_the_free_realms_desc:0 "Arbaran's legacy is one of fighting against Evil, wherever it is found. We were called the Campground of the Free Realms, for all the Free Peoples have mustered here to ride forth to war against the Sorcerer King. These lands were awarded to Ianren the Rider for his efforts in the War against the Sorcerer King. Now, yet again, evil looms in Cannor. Witch-Kings rule over their petty kingdoms with no regard for the lives of their subjects. How long before one of them rises in power enough to bring down the Empire itself? How long before we have another Sorcerer King on our hands? \n\n No, this cannot be allowed. Evil must be snuffed out while it is still weak. To arms, men of the Empire, to arms, Free People of Arbaran! We march against the Witch-Kings once more!"
 A46_eastern_clstc_title:0 "Eastern CLSTC"
 A46_eastern_clstc_desc:0 "Our wars against the evils of Escann have had the fortunate side effect that we now occupy vast swaths of land there. The Company is naturally very interested in expanding its operations in the East, to make use of the great riches that we now have available."
 A46_vanquish_all_evil_title:0 "Vanquish All Evil"
 A46_vanquish_all_evil_desc:0 "We have triumphed, Cannor is at last safe from the evils that have threatened it. Naturally, thanks to our great efforts in ridding all of Cannor of this scum, we reap the glory of our renewed reputation. Arbaran, great vanquisher of all Evil, bane of Witch-Kings! It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?"
 A46_enact_greentide_adventurer_taxes_title:0 "Enact Taxes on Adventurers"
 A46_enact_greentide_adventurer_taxes_desc:0 "The death of Korgus Dookanson at the hands of the heroine Corin did not end the Greentide completely, but it did inspire many adventurers from Western Cannor to embark on quests to reclaim Escann from the vile Orcs. As luck would have it, many of them must pass through our realm to get there. If we enact tolls and taxes on any who wish to get to Escann through our lands, we can make a hefty profit."
 A46_incentivize_adventurer_interests_title:0 "Incentives for Adventurers"
 A46_incentivize_adventurer_interests_desc:0 "Arbaran has a long history of granting noble titles to the most valiant of mercenaries and adventurers in its service. Knowing that any common mercenary may become a noble lord if they prove themselves goes great lengths to inspire them to fight well. Continuing this policy with the new influx of Greentide Adventurers is only in our interest."
 A46_emperors_blessing_title:0 "The Emperor's Blessing"
 A46_emperors_blessing_desc:0 "Our crucial role as Marquis of the Northern March requires us to take whatever actions necessary to protect the Empire from outside threats. One of these threats is the Elfrealm of Ibevar, our longtime rival and constant thorn in Anbennar's side. We are finally in a position to end this threat once and for all and secure complete control over the Forlorn Vale, but we must seek the Emperor's blessing for such an endeavor, or else our actions may be regarded as undue aggression by the wider world."
 A46_the_elfrealms_demise_title:0 "The Elfrealm's Demise"
 A46_the_elfrealms_demise_desc:0 "The reclusive Elves of Ibevar were finally broken. Their lands are part of the Empire they had resisted for so long. We stand as the undisputed power in the Forlorn Vale. Before we set our sights further, however, we must ensure that the Elves do not revolt against our rule. While they may not be content with the new status quo, we will make them understand that they have no other options anymore."
 A46_elvenaire_administration_title:0 "Elvenaire Administration"
 A46_elvenaire_administration_desc:0 "Administrating Ibevar has proven to be a challenge. As it turns out, an entire nation of people who will keep their seething resentment over being conquered for hundreds of years is not that easy to subdue. Luckily, our friends in Elvenaire may be able to help us out. With their charms, they will be able to convince at least some of the more stubborn Ibevari that our rule is not so bad as they think."
 A46_stand_against_the_new_realms_title:0 "Against the New Realms"
 A46_stand_against_the_new_realms_desc:0 "The Greentide left all of Escann devastated and depopulated. However, intrepid souls from Western Cannor and returning refugees have resettled the land. Now, new realms occupy the lands in place of the old, founded by Adventurers. These upstarts occupying our buffer zone with the rest of Escann is unacceptable. Drive them out of the Forlorn Vale and secure our hold here once and for all!"
 A46_fortify_the_eastern_borders_title:0 "Fortify the Eastern Border"
 A46_fortify_the_eastern_borders_desc:0 "With the Forlorn Vale fully under our rule, we can set about securing the Empire's Eastern flank by setting up fortifications. The realms of Escann only grow stronger with time, and it is a matter of when, not if, the next threat to Anbennar rises."
 A46_bastion_of_the_east_title:0 "Bastion of the East"
 A46_bastion_of_the_east_desc:0 "Escandar, great bastion of the East, one of Calasandur's three great castles. It was originally built to protect the Borders from assaults by the Sorcerer King, now it mainly serves as protection against Businor. Our ancestral right as the castle's stewards is something few would dispute exists, but the castle has long since slipped from the control of Calasandur's scions. Few take such claims seriously nowadays, but we grew powerful and rich. It is time to leverage some of that power and get back what was lost."

 #Decisions 
 reclaim_escandar_title:0 "Reclaiming Escandar"
 reclaim_escandar_desc:0 "We are the only true heirs of Calasandur, the Great Builder, as such, we must reclaim his greatest works, his castles. The great castle of Escandar is one outside of our direct reach, however. While declaring war is certainly a possible way to reclaim our rightful posessions, a conflict in the Borders would be a logistical nightmare. We may consider negotiating a trade with the castle's current occupants, or we could threaten them into handing it over without a war. If a peaceful resolution fails, war is always an option."
