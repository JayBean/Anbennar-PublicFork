 flavour_baihon_xinh.1.t:0 "The Final Supplication"
 flavour_baihon_xinh.1.d:0 "A great man stands upon a dark, grassy hill, gazing up at the clear night sky. He sees not the stars, nor the moon, but three paper lanterns fluttering in a wind he could not feel. A fourth lays at his feet, bereft of flight far too early, and solemnly awaiting the company of its three wayward lights. The great man’s eyes blink away absent tears, his heart filled with futile regrets as he proclaims a vow: these remaining three lanterns shall never fall from the sky so long as he can offer them his aid. He would invoke the winds, halt the sun’s rise, and muster the heart of the land to prevent these ailing lights from touching the ground once more. And so he did, and so he will do, for as long as he clings to all that is, all that was, and all that will be.\n\nA man does not stumble into greatness, witless and ignorant of the principles and schemes of those beneath him. No, a great man carves himself into the flesh of history, leaving scars and gashes that will not fade until long after he dies. Caoban Sang did just this: he carved his legacy into the Thidinkai, mutilating virtue and supplanting rectitude with each well-considered slash of his knife, all to ensure what he built did not fall. Yet it would seem that morality and integrity are entwined concepts, not as easily defiled as Sang once thought.\n\nThe only three lanterns in his night sky sought to undo him. His three beloved sons, to which he would do almost anything for, desired the one thing he could not give them. They wished for the dissolution of Baihon Xinh–of the house that would carry on Sang’s memory after his death. A scheme, one to divide the foundations of his home between the three of his sons, was crafted in secret, according to a close aide of Sang. His Giadinh would soon crumble.\n\nA man is driven to greatness by the quality of his character: valor, hope, and probity. Qualities absent in lesser men compel him to greater heights, yet one trait that had been unknown to him for nearly two decades finally reared its head once again. Fear. Fear that once again, those closest to him would seek to undo his life, to mend the wounds he has left upon the world, to erase him from the minds of those that he seeks to impress."

 flavour_baihon_xinh.2.d:0 "Summons were sent out to his sons for a grand banquet in Tuan Caoban, a final farewell. Sang was nearly eighty-one, after all; the end of his natural life would soon come to pass. His sons would wish to see him one last time, arriving from the south, the west, and the north. The eldest had sought the Dread Pirate Ping Shuang’s favor and the release of his former domain, the grand trading city of Cây Cam Sinh. Sang did not expect success in this endeavor, and unsurprisingly, it seemed as though his eldest son had made little progress. The middle son had been sent to the west to reinforce the empire’s ties with its Gon subjects, regularly attending audiences and banquets with the noble warlord Kha Cham Lekhot and his retinue. Again, little progress was expected in these endeavors, yet the man came to the banquet with childlike wonder, discussing tales of new friendships, strengthened alliances, and a new age for Baihon Xinh. If only Sang could believe such words. The youngest son, and the most dear child to Sang, arrived from his post to the north, governing the Phonan lands surrounding the temple complex dotting the plains of Xa Vaung. At first glance, Sang’s son seemed different, somehow changed. He neglected to wear traditional Kai garb, instead opting for a gown more commonly seen in the lands of Bomdan.\n\nWhat began as pleasantries quickly devolved into bickering, then outright argument. It quickly became clear to Sang that his Giadinh had withered into a husk of its former self. Sang quickly excused himself, unable to deliver the righteous punishment of betrayal firsthand. Yet the screams he heard would not soon leave his mind. Addled and bereaved, but not yet broken, Sang communed with his most loyal mystics. He needed more time–far, far more time. Incense was lit, his body and spirit were ritualistically cleansed, and thus came the final step. He had his mystics leave him, for he wished to be with his family for but a moment. Staring at a portrait of his united family, he gripped the dagger that had been gifted to him by his late wife. And without a moment’s hesitation, he plunged the dagger into his abdomen, disemboweling himself. As his mind drifted into the dark, a quiet corner of his mind half-wished to wake up amidst the spirits of his slain kin, to be reunited at last."

 flavour_baihon_xinh.3.d:0 "Two thuds. Dinh’s head would soon follow. He and his brothers had been lined up in the banquet hall from oldest to youngest by a small group of royal guardsmen and were now facing their last moments amidst the living. The executioner lopped off the heads of his own kin, and Dinh knew this was his final chance to survive just a few moments longer. As the heads left the bodies of his brothers, Dinh talked quickly, pleading for the executioner to spare his life and making promises of rewards. His silver tongue seemed to convince the man, who told him that Dinh reminded him of his own child. He released Dinh and promised to tell the Emperor that he was dead. Dinh set out northward alone on horseback where the Phonan people hid him from the eyes of the Emperor and promised him their support when they heard his story.\n\nWeeks passed with silence on the part of the Emperor, an opportunity Dinh did not let slip. The many connections he had made in preparation for the succession struggle paid dividends and already a great army was gathering in Mo Hoang to depose the Driven Emperor."

 flavour_baihon_xinh.4.d:0 "That was what the second son had promised his father. A new age for Baihon Xinh. A laughable cover for the rancid corpse of an empire that the lost siblings were planning to create, true, but it was not a lie.\n\nThe warlord of the Gon, Kha Cham Lekhot, has fancied himself a king unheeding of the mantle of the Baihon Xinh. Citing the unjust execution of the middle son, the Kingdom of Nagon has rallied a rebel army and declared independence from their homeland.\n\nWhether such an act will go unpunished is unclear, but one thing is certain: the Phonans present a far more immediate threat, and must be dealt with swiftly."

 flavour_baihon_xinh.5.d:0 "Ire. The natural conclusion of fear is hate in its purest form. Not a hatred of a concept’s potential, but of the concept itself. A righteous ire born of what could have been, a supposed tragedy prevented by a tragedy perpetrated.\n\nCaoban Sang awakes with a start. He lets out a small yawn and slowly adjusts to his new incorporeal form. He was no longer a great man. He fully recognized this fact, aware that he was simply a specter clutching tightly to his past life to finally realize the ambitions he could not attain while still living. No matter.\n\nSang takes one final look around the room, filled with mementos of his lost family. There it was again – ire. He grabbed at a tinderbox, his hand sliding through it like water through a sieve. Chuckling to himself, he calls in his mystics, who had been dutifully waiting all this time for him to awaken. These were men of magic and spirits, yet all looked nervous, with beads of sweat lining their brows and quickering lips. No matter. The Ghost Emperor had the men torch his room, along with the memory of the family that had betrayed him for a second time.\n\nFinally, the Ghost Emperor looks out from the palace balcony to an army in disarray, quickly organizing itself to march. He glances at his subordinates, who deliver an abrasive truth: his youngest and most foolish son had survived the executioner through an immature guile born of inexperience and want. The executioner was forced to behead himself for his failure, but the damage has been done. The Phonan fools had already flocked to Dinh as the new emperor of Baihon Xinh and were now marching on the capital."
