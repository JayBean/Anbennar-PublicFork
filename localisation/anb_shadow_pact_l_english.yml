 shadow_pact:0 "Shadow Pact"
 shadow_pact_religion_desc:0 "The Shadow Pact represents a wide range of beliefs and practices that venerate the powerful beings of the Shadow Plane. Its followers believe that their souls go to the Shadow Plane after their demise, and so seek to gain favor with the powerful beings of that plane in order to have a better afterlife for both themselves and their loved ones. The practices and teachings of the Shadow Pact vary widely depending on the region its practicioners are from. These beliefs are all united around the concept that nothing is free in this reality, and that to receive a blessing, something must be sacrificed."

 shadow_pact.3.t:0 "Reading the Portents"
 shadow_pact.3.d:0 "Long shadows stretch from candles in a dark and private chamber, as [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] watches the arrangement of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] portents. The process has been meticulous, as befits the destiny of a [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]; hours of rituals, readings, and incantations have already passed... eagerness mixes with nervousness, as the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s eyes meet those of their fortune teller.\n\nWith this reading, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] fate is now sealed.\n\n[Root.ShadowPactFirstPortent]\n\n[Root.ShadowPactSecondPortent]\n\n[Root.ShadowPactThirdPortent]"
 shadow_pact.3.a:0 "Then let this be my fate."

 shadow_pact_sorcerer_ritual_adm:0 "The Sorcerer - STUB"
 shadow_pact_wraith_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a collection of stones, drawn blindly from a bag. They are each of a glassy, dark obsidian, save for two starkly white stones that seem almost like eyes amidst the darkness.\n"Ahhh... sweet regret. The Wraith haunts your past, whispering of desires unfulfilled. Perhaps it is something you did, or perhaps something you wish you had done. Find wisdom and courage in your regrets, for though they are your past they need not be your future.""

 shadow_pact_tyrant_ritual_adm:0 "The Tyrant - STUB"
 shadow_pact_sleeper_ritual_adm:0 "The Sleeper - STUB"
 shadow_pact_burden_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a collection of stones, drawn blindly from a bag. Nothing seems special about them at first, but when weighed against the stones remaining in the bag they are heavier than them all combined.\n"You have carried the Burden before, learned from its harsh lessons and grown strong under its weight. Forgive me for imparting a final lesson. Those past burdens you still carry, cast them off or find others to help you carry them.""
 shadow_pact_time_ritual_adm:0 "Time - STUB"
 shadow_pact_defiant_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a now still cup of once-boiling water and the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s blood. The blood floats defiant on the surface, heedless of the state of the water.\n"Fire must seem a trifling thing, when the Defiant once burned in your blood. Your past is one of courage, perhaps small or perhaps grand. When it truly mattered, you stood for your beliefs. That fire is still in you, ready to ignite again... Be careful what you choose to burn.""
 shadow_pact_madness_ritual_adm:0 "Madness - STUB"
 shadow_pact_golem_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a folded sheet of parchment, pressed with ink by the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s own hand. The ink has since dried, and as the parchment is unfolded it reveals the shape of a hammer.\n"The Golem has marked your past. No structure can stand on a bed of sand, and it seems your foundations were shaped by a firm hand. Trust in their strength, stand tall and proud. But remember to look beyond your foundation, lest it become a cage.""

 shadow_pact_mother_ritual_adm:0 "The Mother - STUB"

 shadow_pact_sorcerer_ritual_dip:0 "The Sorcerer - STUB"
 shadow_pact_wraith_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a shifting pattern of foam, formed from boiling drops of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s blood in water. It has formed a ghostly, weeping, face.\n"The Wraith dogs your step, its cold hand reaching for your heart. Perhaps there is something you desire, that eludes your grasp? Or perhaps the wraith inhabits one who desires what is yours. Cherish the life you have now, that is what the Wraith seeks. For it is dead, and you are living.""

 shadow_pact_sleeper_ritual_dip:0 "The Sleeper - STUB"
 shadow_pact_burden_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent comes from the entrails of beasts hunted, slaughtered, or found dead, this very day. The fortune teller runs their thumb across a particularly bloated esophagus, and squeezes out a fist sized rock.\n"They could not bear the Burden... But you might yet survive it. In the present, a great weight is upon you. Perhaps you bear it willingly, perhaps it was forced on you. But remember, you need not bear it alone.""
 shadow_pact_time_ritual_dip:0 "Time - STUB"
 shadow_pact_defiant_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent requires nothing but the two already present. The fortune teller searches the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s eyes, searching for something they had seen in the many rituals prior. When they find it, they seem almost... Startled.\n"... Do you have many enemies? Forgive me - I forget myself, my [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Defiant has marked you for glory, and whatever you face will find your courage unequaled. But be careful, the whole world need not be your foe.""
 shadow_pact_madness_ritual_dip:0 "Madness - STUB"
 shadow_pact_golem_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a scorched wooden bowl, containing a single ashen bone. Where one might have expected it to shatter under the heat, its surface is hard and smooth. The fortune teller snaps it in half with surprising ease.\n"The Golem favors you, in the present. You are strong and solid, not easily moved or changed by the outside world. That which you build will be strong too... But beware, what doesn't bend may sometimes break.""

 shadow_pact_sorcerer_ritual_mil:0 "The Sorcerer - STUB"
 shadow_pact_wraith_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a scorched wooden bowl filled with animal bones. The bones are arranged in humanoid shape, with the scorch mark forming an uncanny shadow behind them.\n"The Wraith hangs over your future, like a dreadful cloud. You will know loss, disappointment, and regret, in the twilight of your life. But do not let the fear of regret prevent you from living now, for the truest sorrow is to have never had anything to lose at all.""

 shadow_pact_sleeper_ritual_mil:0 "The Sleeper - STUB"
 shadow_pact_burden_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a recording of a vision seen in smoke. Hours ago, the fortune teller had instructed [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] to breathe deeply with their head shrouded in smoke. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had a vision of the ceiling caving in, burying [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] alive.\n"The Burden looms over your future, an ill omen. But there is yet time to ensure that, when the burden comes, you are strong enough to carry it. Remember, that strength need not come from you alone.""
 shadow_pact_time_ritual_mil:0 "Time - STUB"
 shadow_pact_defiant_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a folded sheet of parchment, pressed with ink by the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s own hand. The ink has since dried, and as the parchment is unfolded it reveals the shape of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand exactly.\n"Ah. The Defiant often... chafes against these sorts of readings. What greater power is there to defy than destiny itself? Your future will be one of your own making, the challenges you face overcome by your will. But remember, you need not face them alone.""
 shadow_pact_madness_ritual_mil:0 "Madness - STUB"
 shadow_pact_golem_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a collection of stones, drawn blindly from a bag. They have been pressed together, each one fitting like a puzzle piece, to construct a perfectly formed stone brick.\n"The Golem, it seems, favors your future. Your hands will shape this world of clay, and see it hardened and tempered. But be careful of what you choose to build, for it will stand firm against change. For good, or for ill.""
