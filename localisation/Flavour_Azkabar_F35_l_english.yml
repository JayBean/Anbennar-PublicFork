 F35_into_the_underbelly_title:0 "Into the Underbelly"
 F35_into_the_underbelly_desc:0 "Whilst there are older cities in Bulwar, greater cities even, there are none that possess as much of a strong sense of justice and piety as we. However our legendary prisons, and our (in)famous crime ridden underbelly sit at distinct odds. We must embark on a process to gain control of this dark side of our realm or burn it out."

 F35_striking_sareyand_title:0 "Striking Sareyand"
 F35_striking_sareyand_desc:0 "There are many obstacles in the way of the rise of our proud nation. The most obvious of which are the phoenix kingdoms which surround us. Powerful and with many misguided vassals under their power. Sareyand is our first target, as we must seize independence to follow our destiny. With a build up of our armed forces, and some ‘subtle diplomatic work’ we can also surely find allies in their other vassals."

 F35_the_order_of_judges_title:0 "Order of Judges"
 F35_the_order_of_judges_desc:0 "The Order of Judges is a proud institution, a wandering group of judges who bring justice and the arm of the law to anywhere in which they roam. By inviting them to stay within some of our newly acquired lands, we can surely make use of their expertise to help with our administration, and to bring them closer to some… associates."
 
 F35_install_loyal_judges_title:0 "Install Loyal Judges"
 F35_install_loyal_judges_desc:0 "Whilst the law is sacred, it can also be fickle. Prone to interpretation that does not benefit us, or Eclipse Cult. It is natural that we must then persuade as many judges as possible into our fold, and for those that remain stubborn? They are but men, replaceable men."

 F35_expansion_of_the_cult_title:0 "Expansion of the Cult"
 F35_expansion_of_the_cult_desc:0 "As our power grows, so too does the need for our covert friends to grow. With proper investment into infrastructure for them, we can undoubtedly assure their successes, and their successes, are ours."

 F35_expose_project_divinity_title:0 "Expose Project Divinity"
 F35_expose_project_divinity_desc:0 "A benefit of having so many Eclipse Agents prowling the dark corners of Bulwar, is that when there is heresy and terrible secrets abound, we are oft the first to hear it, and foul news is reaching our ears indeed, relating to a terrible ambition from the realm of Varamhar. We must investigate further, and ensure their vassals are receptive to our words."

 F35_shadow_over_the_lake_title:0 "Shadow Over the Lake"
 F35_shadow_over_the_lake_desc:0 "Via careful planning from the hands of our friends in the Eclipse cult, we have ensured that the ancient realms of Akalšes and Kumarkand are within our control, and it is important to ensure that we solidify this control, for their own safety, and to propel our ambitions further."

 F35_shadow_over_ash_title:0 "Shadow Over the Ash"
 F35_shadow_over_ash_desc:0 "Whilst our first victories over Sareyand have already proven incredible, we have little time to rest, for time is of the essence. We must send agents to infiltrate and grease the wheels of public opinion to be receptive to the truth. That the rulers of Sareyand are heretics, which will surely grant us appropriate leeway to strike them again, and soon." 

 F35_light_in_the_mountains_title:0 "Light in the Mountains"
 F35_light_in_the_mountains_desc:0 "The Gelkar are a proud and strong people, but one shackled by their situation. With appropriate efforts, either in conquest or liberation, we can ensure their strength is present to swell our own, for our mutual interest in the glory of Surakel!"

 F35_eclipse_of_the_garden_title:0 "Eclipse of the Garden"
 F35_eclipse_of_the_garden_desc:0 "A New Day dawns in Bulwar. A force of purity and piety, arising from the cinders of a burning phoenix, to bring peace and order to this troubled garden. Under our flag, we must bring together many of the storied and ancient realms of Bulwar with diplomacy and guile so that we may continue His holy work. Glory to Surakel, Glory to the Aršunaellu!" 

 F35_the_oldest_temple_title:0 "The Oldest Temple"
 F35_the_oldest_temple_desc:0 "It is said that Eduz-Vacyn is the oldest temple to Surakel across Bulwar, and one that has passed through many hands, and has always been a powerful voice towards different theological interpretations of the Sun Cult alongside the other two major temples along the Suran, in Bulwar and Azka-Sur. We should direct our friends in the Eclipse Cult to make some ‘persuasive theological arguments’ and gain positions of power in the temple of Eduz-Vacyn"

 F35_eclipse_of_the_source_title:0 "Eclipse of the Source"
 F35_eclipse_of_the_source_desc:0 "Whilst the Khet have their Sorrow, and the Alenics their titular Alen, no river in the Garden nourishes as much as the Suran, and stretches as long. Along it, three of the most important, influential temples in the entirety of Bulwar. Whilst Eduz-Vacyn is already in our power, we would be remiss to not aim to further our voice in the theological circles, and our temporal power by securing a ‘mutually beneficial relationship’ with Azka-Sur, and the Eclipse Cults have some marvellous ideas on how to convince the leadership…"

 F35_mining_the_past_title:0 "Mining the Past"
 F35_mining_the_past_desc:0 "Finally, we’re beginning to make progress on recovering the secrets of the construction of the Black Walls, having uncovered a source of the ‘obsidian’ that makes them up located below our very own Lake Naza. Unfortunately, it seems getting it out from under the lake is going to be even harder than just finding it. Fortunately, we also happen to know people for whom a challenge like this is merely enrichment. Send for the Dwarves!"

 F35_obtain_the_obsidian_title:0 "Obtain the Obsidian"
 F35_obtain_the_obsidian_desc:0 "The dwarves are here! And they’re already making many demands for us to build up the infrastructure of the lands around the lake, reporting that ‘there’s not a chance in hell they work without it’. Well, they are the experts and we do need that obsidian. Construction must begin at once!

 F35_replicate_the_walls_title:0 "Replicate the Walls"
 F35_replicate_the_walls_desc:0 "If we are to ever replicate the Black Walls in reality, we must dig deeper and greedier than any before. Infrastructure must be built up in the Black Mines, and the very mountains themselves hollowed out and every scrap of obsidian collected for the holy work to come"


#Part2
 F35_a_whisper_in_every_temple_title:0 "A Whisper in Every Temple"
 F35_a_whisper_in_every_temple_desc:0 "TO DO"

 F35_a_lie_in_every_ear_title:0 "A Lie in Every Ear"
 F35_a_lie_in_every_ear_desc:0 "TO DO"

 F35_the_truth_in_every_word_title:0 "The Truth in Every word"
 F35_the_truth_in_every_word_desc:0 "TO DO"

 F35_forward_inspection_base_title:0 "Forward Inspection Base"
 forward_inspection_base_desc:0 "Our land is rich, and bounteous. The envy of all across the world, who hunger for the Gardens delights. Whilst existing entirely without trade is sadly impossible, we must be wary of foreign influences and subversions attempting to exploit the privilege of entering our land. By securing forwards inspection bases, we can inspect and interrogate before sea-bound merchants even step foot inside a Bulwari harbour" 

 F35_end_of_foreign_lies_title:0 "End of Foreign Lies"
 F35_end_of_foreign_lies_desc:0 "With the proper lands secured, all that remains is to build up these isles into ports and harbours able to hold every ship interested in buying Bulwari goods, and creating a navy powerful enough to project our influence- and sink anyone who tries to dodge inspection. All will answer before Surakel."

 F35_subplant_the_kasra_title:0 "Supplant the Kašra"
 F35_subplant_the_kasra_desc:0 "The most important and holy sites across the Garden are firmly within our hands, in borders, if not theologically. The Eclipse Cult already works to infiltrate and secure a hold into every level of the clergy, and deal with… subversive elements, we must ensure the cities are properly calmed enough for them to work undisturbed."

 F35_devastated_west_title:0 "Devastated West"
 F35_devastated_west_desc:0 "The rich and proud land of Bahar was ruined more than any during the Decades of Devastation, and is now filled with squatting goblins, occupying rightful Bulwari lands! Our agents and Eclipse friends are already working to spread the word, and we must back said word with steel, and liberate Bahar!"

 F35_bulwari_cultural_supremacy_title:0 "Ensure Bulwari Supremacy"
 F35_bulwari_cultural_supremacy_desc:0 "With our reconquest of the furthest fringes of Bulwar, we’ve come across an interesting series of conundrums, namely the presence of predominantly Cannorian and Raheni lands. Obviously, this situation is intolerable, and we must ensure these squatters leave immediately, and let true Bulwari settle their land. Within our court, there are also some whispers about what to do with the Children of Šadru. The dwarves." 

 F35_supremacy_of_surakes_title:0 "Supremacy of Surakeš"
 F35_supremacy_of_surakes_desc:0 "We are so close. The Garden is nearly unified under true Bulwari hands, for the first time in centuries, and we must ensure that this becomes a reality. In addition, our many vassals will surely be able to be persuaded to tighten the bonds of the Aršunaellu, for the good of Bulwar. If not, well, it shall be the last mistake they make. For Surakel and Surakeš."

 F35_amman_attalu_title:0 "Amman-Attalu"
 F35_amman_attalu_desc:0 "The Sun Cult is a complicated religion. Thousands of years of layered, evolved tales and stories interpreted and retold in a thousand different ways. Fortunately, we know the correct one. We must take steps to ensure everyone else does, as well. With the building of infrastructure to support a holy and purifying crusade against heathens and heretics. In the Name of Surakel!"

 F35_necessary_renegotiation_title:0 "A Necessary Renegotiation"
 F35_necessary_renegotiation_desc:0 "Our friends in the Aršunaellu have served us well so far, but as we go forwards, we must strengthen our position, and bring our proud union closer together, in strength and purpose. With proper persuasion, this shall likely be an easy argument to make. Surely."

 F35_new_eclipse_cult_title:0 "The New Eclipse Cult"
 F35_new_eclipse_cult_desc:0 "What do you do, when you win. Across all of Bulwar, the Eclipse Cult pulls strings, manipulating politics, faith and justice to their own righteous ends. They’ve grown in power, number and strength beyond their wildest dreams, and are undoubtedly one of the most powerful and holy groups in our Garden… so what aim do they focus their zealous purpose on now? Well. That debate shall rage."

 F35_cleanse_the_garden_title:0 "Cleanse The Garden"
 F35_cleanse_the_garden_desc:0 "The Eclipse Cult’s purpose is once more revealed to them! Our garden is riddled with parasites, vermin and weeds. These monsters masquerading as people must be removed, at any costs. We must steel our hearts, and open our souls to Surakel, and remove them. All of them."

 F35_garden_purified_title:0 "The Garden Purified"
 F35_garden_purified_desc:0 "The Work proceeds as it must. So efficient have we become in our purification, that it can be reduced to mindless bureaucracy. A signing of papers, an assignment of bonus pay here and there, and the numbers of the pests and parasites has nearly dropped to zero. Whilst those remain still fume with hate, it’s too late. We’ve won, and soon Surakel’s holy work will be done. We will have a Pure, Bulwari, Garden. Their lands will be ours, their homes ours, and their abominable cultures shall be dust."
 
 F35_final_eclipse_title:0 "A Final Eclipse"
 F35_final_eclipse_desc:0 "It is done. From Bahar to the Salahad. A peace unlike Bulwar has known since before Surakel’s Sacrifice. Under the Wise Guidance of the Eclipse cult, our nation has grown from a backwater city state, into the protectors of Bulwar, and the purifiers of the Garden. Only a few minor steps remain. Then we will be at peace. Forever."

 F35_forgotten_east_title:0 "The Forgotten East"
 F35_forgotten_east_desc:0 "The East of our lands is primarily endless miles of rugged and blasted desert, the scorched remains of Amaštu’s domain. It is more ideal for us to grant this land to a series of local vassals, than try to tame the Salahad ourselves. They are as a part of Bulwar as the fertile swathes of riverland, even if they present their unique challenges."

 F35_network_completed_title:0 "The Network Complete"
 F35_network_completed_desc:0 "Our land is beautiful, Peaceful. Prosperous. Our citizens go about their lives in relative calmness, in the sunny land of Bulwar, unaware and uncaring of the dangers outside the borders of Bulwar. They live this life, either unaware, or apathetic to the Bitdyatu. Not just normal prisons, but massive obsidian complexes, designed to host any who would dare disrupt our peace. Many would rather face execution that enter into these abyssal complexes. That, however, is not their decision to make."
 
 F35_necessary_step_further_title:0 "A Necessary Step Further"
 F35_necessary_step_further_desc:0 "The Black Walls do much to protect our realm. Their grandeur and ominous visage driving away many attacks before they even happen. However, not all dangers arise from without. The malady that comes from inside can be just as lethal, and it is perhaps time to ensure that no cancer shall poison our realm."

 F35_research_the_prison_title:0 "Research The Prison"
 F35_research_the_prison_desc:0 "None can deny that the prison of Azkabar is effective at its job. However, if we are to apply its lessons across all of Bulwar, then we must understand why it is so effective. With proper studying of it’s mysteries, and the methods by which the jailers operate, then perhaps we could more easily replicate their efficiency"

 F35_secrets_of_the_jailers_title:0 "The Secret of The Jailers"
 F35_secrets_of_the_jailers_desc:0 "Of course, the answer was never as mundane as it seemed. The jailers of Azkabar utilise a particularly wicked and vicious magic to rend the body and mind of those who disobey, a pain so potent many would prefer to die than face it again. We must learn to replicate this wonderful tool"

 F35_black_walls_of_bulwar_title:0 "The Black Walls"
 F35_black_walls_of_bulwar_desc:0 "The plans are nothing simple. Miles of obsidian walls, reinforced with potent magic. A towering symbol of Bulwari strength, and one that will grant safety to our people, forever. First, we must secure more obsidian, and our geologists have many suggestions. Of course, damestear is also needed for the magic. When our work is done, no other power could ever come close to matching our glory, or even stepping foot in our soil. The Garden will be Safe."


#Events
 flavour_azkabar.1.t:0 "The Obsidian Walls"
 flavour_azkabar.1.d:0 "Towering onyx black walls, standing taller than ten men, and thrice as wide, devouring the light and hopes of those who would look upon Azkabar with avarice. For decades upon centuries, the mighty obsidian walls of Azkabar have stood against mages, hellfire and the dangers of a thousand calamities. Whilst for many years it has been believed that the secrets of their construction had been lost, the Akal, Idris szel-Attalu holds a zealous belief that with enough searching, even this mystery may be uncovered."
 flavour_azkabar.1.a:0 "Begin preparations to investigate, posthaste."

 flavour_azkabar.2.t:0 "A mystery unveiled"
 flavour_azkabar.2.d:0 "The letter is silently opened under the light of a dying candle. Tired eyes scan the paper with a mix of trepidation and excitement. It tells of a craftsman, dwarfish, who claimed to know where to find more of the ‘obsidian’ than we could imagine. Below Lake Naza, the verdant blue spot that along with its river tributary provides our beloved Azkabar with much of its water. Though the news did bring a token of good tidings, it also brought with it a headache and a question, which the [Root.Monarch.GetName] could not help to voice. “How in the name of Surakel are we to get it?”"
 flavour_azkabar.2.a:0 "The answer came to them sharply. Who better to unearth it, than the ones who found it."

 flavour_azkabar.3.t:0 "Something Rotten in the Akalate of Azkabar"
 flavour_azkabar.3.d:0 "Another day in Azkabar. Within the borders of the city thrives a vibrant community of faithful and loyal children of Surakel. Or at least, so the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would desperately say to any watchful eye from the many temples of the Garden. Away from the warmth and revealing light of the sun, rests and ferments a rot which marrs the city's commerce, administration and good name. Drugs and Alcohol peddled over games of chance in houses of ill repute, scorning the good name of Surakel, speaking his name with irreverence as they plot ever more fiendish and vile schemes.\n\nCracking down on these practices is the natural option, but this is a rot that is deep set, and in the dark of this night, as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] silently rests in solitude and contemplation, they cannot help but consider the fruits of cooperation. The wealth, the power, the control."
 flavour_azkabar.3.a:0 "Either way, they would have to choose. Decisively"

 flavour_azkabar.4.t:0 "The Underbelly: Drugs"
 flavour_azkabar.4.d:0 "Another day, and another report. This one speaking of yet another aspect of the rot that has set into the city. A tale of seemingly normal homes, with concoctions and tinctures to addle the mind and deceive the senses bubbling away below, out of sight. They speak of men and women throwing every coin and belonging into the awaiting hands of the peddlers of these tonics. Trading pounds of flesh and years of life for the artificial bliss promised whilst the makers feud and slaughter each other to control this hidden industry… at least in the worst cases.\n\nIn others, tales of new insights, spiritual relief and joy found in their dazes… and of the incredible profits turned. Whether these substances and their making be crushed entirely, or simply regulated under the subtle but unescapable eye of the state… That choice is the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s."
 flavour_azkabar.4.a:0 "We will regulate this promising sector"
 flavour_azkabar.4.b:0 "Crush these peddlers, and confiscate their wealth"

 flavour_azkabar.5.t:0 "The Underbelly: Alcohol"
 flavour_azkabar.5.d:0 "Whilst drinking is a beloved pastime for many of the children of Bulwar, loosening tongues, strengthening friendships and bringing merriment, at least in the best case. In the city’s fringes and hidden corners, people have taken to distilling their own potent brews, capable of addling a man's senses utterly with but a few glasses or even potentially poisoning them with its sheer potency… And less than desirable conditions in which this is done.\n\nThis coincides with some of our realm' more radical thinkers postulating on the potential dangers of drink to a man's health and thoughts, turning mild mannered thinkers into zealous and passionate brutes.\n\nEither way, the choice falls to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] on how to handle this contentious issue."
 flavour_azkabar.5.a:0 "Bottoms up"
 flavour_azkabar.5.b:0 "Sober them up"

 flavour_azkabar.6.t:0 "The Underbelly: Prostitution"
 flavour_azkabar.6.d:0 "Whilst Drugs and Alcohol are perhaps unnatural pleasures and temptations, created by the flawed hands of men, the pleasure and temptation of the flesh is one that is felt by most, and indulged with regularity. Whilst there is nothing inherently wrong with such, the Underbelly of Azkabar has a way of twisting the most natural of desires into sinful vices, to be capitalized upon.\n\nWhilst the details are lurid enough to make the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] feel sick, the reality of prostitution in the city is undeniable and undeniably profitable. Banning it feels the natural response to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. But a doubt creeps in quietly and quickly. Can they truly enforce a ban like that? Or… perhaps it is better to regulate it. Control it."
 flavour_azkabar.6.a:0 "If you can’t destroy it, at least control it."
 flavour_azkabar.6.b:0 "Ban the practice, with force if need be."

 flavour_azkabar.7.t:0 "The Underbelly: Slavery"
 flavour_azkabar.7.d:0 "The memory of the crack of the lash, and the weight of shackles is a familiar one to the Bulwari people. For millennia, foul demon worshipping Gnolls have yapped at the heels of the true heirs of the Garden, and done all in their power to place them in chains, to either work or burn. A cultural scar, thus, has formed, and a hatred of the foul practice of slavery, for most. However, slavery is not always shackles of iron and cracking whips, it is just as often words on paper, the weight of debt on a neck, that compels ones labours. Whilst rare to find someone literally clasped in irons within our city, the latter is far more common in Azkabar.\n\nObviously, cracking down is a necessity. Allowing such practices to run rampant without any oversight is barbaric and makes us only marginally better than the Gnolls. But the question is how harsh is such a crackdown to be? Shall the practice be washed away into the annals of history, or… More sternly regulated. After all, a labourer who is not paid, is a labourer who does not cost." 
 flavour_azkabar.7.a:0 "In the name of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 flavour_azkabar.7.b:0 "In the name of Surakel!"

 flavour_azkabar.8.t:0 "The Underbelly: Sacrilege"
 flavour_azkabar.8.d:0 "The Bulwari are a people more similar than they are different, some have come to believe and argue over the years. We worship the same God, hold many of the same cultural myths, and stand facing similar issues. Of all of these, the worship of Surakel, or Surael for those who speak Elven, is the most prevalent. Some outsiders have called us zealous in our belief, and they are correct, for we know our beliefs to be true.\n\nThough, like all things, the Underbelly of Azkabar has a way of defying the norm. Still, after all our efforts, the harsh and corrupt life many have lived has done much to inspire cynicism and apathy towards our god. Whilst altering their circumstances proved plausible, altering their thoughts and beliefs is likely a much more intensive effort, requiring large amounts of our resources, thus offering the question. Is it worth it?"
 flavour_azkabar.8.a:0 "Let them doubt"
 flavour_azkabar.8.b:0 "Burn their heresy, to the roots."

 flavour_azkabar.9.t:0 "The Underbelly: An Epilogue"
 flavour_azkabar.9.d:0 "At last, it is done.\n\nDecades of effort, constant time, resources, manpower and effort offered into taming the wild underbelly of Azkabar. Difficult choices were found along the way, and whether by an outstretched hand or a clenched first, the city has been finally subdued. Only time will tell whether our efforts have achieved the results we desired."
 flavour_azkabar.9.a:0 "You reap what you sow"

 flavour_azkabar.10.t:0 "Opening the Black Mines"
 flavour_azkabar.10.d:0 "Whilst the majority of dwarves in the world can be found in Cannor, there are still populations scattered across Bulwar. Everywhere they go, they bring their talents in metallurgy, excavation and crafting. With the plans of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it seems likely that we’ll need significantly more obsidian.\n\nThankfully, the number we’ve employed already has proved incredibly capable, gathering significant amounts of obsidian, as well as a truly massive amount of gems! Truly, these dwarves are friends of Bulwar."
 flavour_azkabar.10.a:0 "Welcome them with open arms!"

 flavour_azkabar.11.t:0 "Cinders and Shadows"
 flavour_azkabar.11.d:0 "It is a dire and sorrowful thing to realise that those who claim piety to be in reality, sinners to the core. To see someone held on a pedestal of faith and virtue wrought low by their own moral failings. Even more so, when it happens to those supposed to shepard and embody the virtues we hold high.\n\nThe rulers of Sareyand are clearly and utterly sinners, oppressing and misleading their people! Some would claim that our evidence is perhaps a tad dogmatic, and overly zealous, but we would claim that there is no such thing! We will march immediately!"
 flavour_azkabar.11.a:0 "To arms! In the name of Surakel!"

 flavour_azkabar.12.t:0 "Trial of Maršan"
 flavour_azkabar.12.d:0 "Rare it is, for something such as a trial to catch the attention of the entirety of our higher echelons but in this instance, it is plain to see how their attentions were so caught. A supposedly corrupt judge by the name of Maršan,has been supposedly abusing his authority and power.\n\nThey repeatedly pleaded their innocence day in, and day out, so completely heart wrenchingly as to compel sympathy from almost all. A good testimony does not an innocent man make and Maršan was sentenced to life in prison. This alone, whilst interesting, is not why the case has found the ears of the leadership of Azkabar. Instead, the nervous spymaster reports a tale of intrigue, scheming, misplaced documents and forged payments. All leading back from the trial, to the mysterious Eclipse Cult. Heretics who’ve twisted themselves to believe that the devastation of our land in the Onslaught was the will of Surakel. Rumours of their activity manipulating and twisting our nation have long existed, but they were thought to just be that. Rumours.\n\nThey were wrong."
 flavour_azkabar.12.a:0 "For the Greater Good"
 
 flavour_azkabar.13.t:0 "Project Divinity Exposed"
 flavour_azkabar.13.d:0 "Heretics are all around. In the streets, skulking in alleyways. In the cloisters, speaking of Surakel with cloying false reverence, holding the darkness in their heart. In the leadership, hiding and twisting the nation into a foul perversion of Surakel’s will. Not just in our realm, but across the entirety of Bulwar.\n\nIt is our duty to keep our senses sharp, and ready, looking everywhere and bringing the burning light of Surakel to those who would defy and poison his garden, and today our beliefs have once more been vindicated!\n\nThe Varamhari are plotting a most foul act, to claim false divinity, and turn their leader into some perverse demiurge.\n\nIt is our duty to turn the light onto them, and reveal their twisted whims to those who serve their Akalate.\n\nOf course, we would take them under our protection."
 flavour_azkabar.13.a:0 "Down with the Pretender!"
 
 flavour_azkabar.14.t:0 "Of Men and Goats"
 flavour_azkabar.14.d:0 "The Gelkar are some of the hardiest people in the entirety of Bulwar. Proud mountain dwellers, who care for their lands and flocks with fierce anger and vicious fighting. Allying with them against the enemies of our realms will only prove mutually beneficial. Gelkari strength, and Azkabari piety."
 flavour_azkabar.14.a:0 "A step forwards!"

 flavour_azkabar.15.t:0 "The Fate of Two"
 flavour_azkabar.15.d:0 "Bulwar has known many empires throughout its history. Many invaders, and many more which sprung from our own soil. Some remnants of these greater empires linger today. The phoenix kingdoms, for instance, but of greater interest to us, are Akalšes and Kumarkand, both once powerful and dignified realms, now reduced to pathetic weak imitations of the nations they used to be.\n\nIt is only right to bring them under our protection and influence."
 flavour_azkabar.15.a:0 "We are the custodians of Bulwars Past. And its future."

 flavour_azkabar.16.t:0 "Dawn of the Aršunaellu"
 flavour_azkabar.16.d:0 "The Eclipse Cults masterwork is nearly done. A genius piece of foreign policy, bringing many of the ancient realms of Bulwar together in a ‘mutually beneficial alliance’ from which our powerbase, and ability to do what needs to be done to protect and unify Bulwar can swell. Some even now protest, but they are soon silenced. There is no time for dissent in this critical hour."
 flavour_azkabar.16.a:0 "Glory to the Aršunaellu!"

 flavour_azkabar.17.t:0 "The Proclamation of Prosperity"
 flavour_azkabar.17.d:0 "Whilst the Black Walls of Bulwar can do much to protect our nation from hostile outsiders, they cannot stop them all. Unwanted subversive elements can still infiltrate inwards, or danger can even rise from within. Naturally, measures must be taken to prevent this.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] proposed the creation of ‘Bidyatu Network’. A massive series of obsidian prisons, dotted across Bulwar, in which the guilty and treasonous will be locked away For the glory of Surakel, and the safety of Bulwar.\n\nThe prisoner of Azkabar will swell with the guilty."
 flavour_azkabar.17.a:0 "Any screaming is to be ignored."

 flavour_azkabar.18.t:0 "Taelarios' Nightmare"
 flavour_azkabar.18.d:0 "”You have to believe me!” the clergyman roared, his exhausted and terrified face speaking volumes, even louder than his words “The Clergy is being infiltrated, on all levels- Please, they are trying to silence me-” a sharp thud from a guard caused him to stumble to the ground, colliding with a thud, before promptly being hauled to his feet, and forced forwards, into the abyssally black walls of Azkabar’s (in)famous prison.\n\nNo one really took notice of a particularly zealous member of the Irrliamzur being arrested for slanderous rumours. Not even his fellow brothers in the faith."
 flavour_azkabar.18.a:0 "For they hailed the eclipse."

 flavour_azkabar.19.t:0 "Azkabar Accords"
 flavour_azkabar.19.d:0 "The meetings of the Aršunaellu were becoming a regular facet of life for the powerholders of the associated realms. After all, there was always more work to be done, more disputes to solve, even as the earlier doubts and paranoia started to fade.\n\nThis growing sense of safety and comradery was shattered as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Azkabar walked into the chamber, flanked by grinning clergymen. It only worsened as they spoke of their proposition. A centralization of the Aršunaellu, around Azkabar, of course. These ‘Azkabar’ accords were nearly thrown out, before the Eclipse Cultists promptly put knives to the throats of the Kumarkandi and Zanbari leadership.\n\nThe accords are signed, and the rebellious leadership goes home to plot, straight into the welcome arms of another mob of cultists.\n\nA tragic murder, caused by foreign and corrupt agents, seeking to destroy Bulwar’s best hope, of course."
 flavour_azkabar.19.a:0 "Now, if only everyone would believe us."

 flavour_azkabar.20.d:0 "To most, the news of having completed one's work would be met with joy and cheers. To the diligent and anxious Eclipse Cult, it was a sign of failing. Undoubtedly, they had succeeded. The nation that had sprung out of Azkabar was the singular largest, most powerful and holy in all of Bulwar, but… it was not enough. The answer came during a debate between the higher ups, when one rather mild looking man simply suggested “Well. What of the monsters?”\n\nA spark is lit in the room.\n\nAn instant fervour of agreement, calls for the head of every creature of the dark in Bulwar, and to purify the Garden of those who would seek to harm it."
 flavour_azkabar.20.a:0 "In the name of Surakel. His will be done."

 flavour_azkabar.21.t:0 "The Children of Šadru"
 flavour_azkabar.21.d:0 "With our duty and new purpose reaffirmed, the matter of where to start on purifying the Garden has emerged. Obviously, there are many foul creatures of the dark that linger in Bulwar, but some advisors from the Eclipse Cult have raised an interesting point. Namely, that our nation is filled with many more… mundane undesirables.\n\nAfter all, are the dwarves of Bulwar, not descendants of the troublesome and meddling Šadru? Who aided enemies of Surakel?\n\nWhilst, obviously they are not as evil as- say - a gnoll, they still must be managed. The question of where to ‘direct’ them, soon emerged, and was swiftly answered. Dwarves love their holds, after all."

 flavour_azkabar.22.t:0 "The Trader who Listened, and The Trader who Lied"
 flavour_azkabar.22.d:0 "One could hear a mouse squeak in the silence. Only footsteps and the sound of shuffled fabric filled the quiet and hot air, as the ‘Inspectors’ did their rounds, inspecting every inch of cargo for ‘restricted goods’. There was none. Plenty of stories emerged of traders cut down for the slightest infraction. Only one in the crowd stood unbothered, a tall man, well kept and with a respectful smile.\n\nWhen the interrogations started, he was the first spoken to, questioned and pushed for every detail.\n\n“I’ve always thought Bulwar was the most beautiful of lands” he lamented. “A place of utter and indescribable glory, under the light of Surakel. A paradise on Halann, protected and maintained by the most dedicated of all peoples, and I’ve always thought that- though I love my home - it was the ultimate tragedy that I was not born Bulwari.\n\nA moment’s silence passes, and he is left through, his smile growing unseen to a smirk.\n\nAs he goes, he lingers long enough to hear the next in line stammer, and then be silenced with a furious roar of gunfire."

 flavour_azkabar.23.t:0 "The Garden Purified"
 flavour_azkabar.23.d:0 "A wind sweeps through the Forbidden Plains and into Bulwar. It creeps along and through silent valleys, whistling through empty roosts and above cracked shells, raising long discarded feathers into one last dance, before scattering them into the valleys below, as it moves. The wind parts, splitting in the hills and mountains. Some goes west, finding their way over the rocky land, brushing the Serpentsreach. Over uncountable unmarked graves and burnt shantytowns, before pushing out into the Divenhal. Much of the rest of the wind pushes south, directed over silent desert, and kicking up sand, allowing one to glimpse shiny white bone resting below the sand, as the wind moves to its final destination in the east.\n\nA single guard at the gates of Rahen bows his head out of the way of the sand, thinking only of his next meal, and of his family."

Held in a glorious round chamber, with seats lining down to the centre, where [Root.Monarch.GetName] eagerly talked of glorious new days, of a future to be seen. Of one nation ruling Bulwar.\n\nWhispers of discontent pass like wildfire through thicket, and when the speech was done, these whispers erupted into shouts from some.\n\nFortunately, our friends in the Eclipse cult were more than able to… persuade them to join with us, a quick flash of steel deadened even the loudest of protests. Everyone left through the main entrance as the news was read, to a massive crowd, which soon erupted into festivity.\n\nEveryone saw the protesting leadership leave.\n\nNo one ever saw them again."

Still smouldering harpy roosts, and gnoll skulls piled high enough to drown a man. Such evidence of our holy work sparks joy in the hearts of the clergy and the Eclipse cult, who now rest easy, knowing they’ve done the work of Surakel across the land.\n\nThe wealth of Bulwar, and it’s people, sits safe behind the Black Walls, holding our people tightly, and presenting a dreadful challenge to any who would try and trample our garden.\n\nThroughout all of Halann, only we can be said to be holy, safe and pure. Through our dedication, our efforts, and our faith."

Who deceived Surakel to lie with him, and when the deceit was revealed, fled to a lake, and to the protection of god Šadru for protection Šadru used his might to swell the land between the garden of Surakel and the lake sheltering her. This created the harpy hills, and soon after, the harpies themselves.\n\nTheir odd and vile ways, as well as their constant raids and hunts have provided them no better than their mother. For millennia they’ve escaped into their hills, taking aloft and hiding in their roost-cities. It is time to change that."

Every few days, a few more heeded their words\n\nThese soldiers, these monsters who would drive her from her home, see her people scour.

Vile hyena like beastmen who’s cackles and whip-cracks have haunted the Bulwari people for millennia. Striking and enslaving untold numbers, either to be sold, worked, or sacrificed to their demonic gods. They are undoubtedly a species of wicked, vile monsters and now, with so many in our lands, it is time for us to take action. Teach our soldiers to disregard any misplaced empathy, teach them to shoot first and think after. Teach them to disregard stories of the Suncrowns and teach them to ignore any cries for mercy."

The shot seems to silence the whole world, as it echoes like a bell through the valleys and mountains of Bulwar. A bell tolling the end of the gnollish presence in Bulwars famous river valleys.\n\nThe implication sinks into the squadron. Every single gnoll was expelled from this place. Untold lives, unknowable struggles and unimaginable suffering. All at their hands."

With a huff, he collapses onto a more stable and flat section, staring at the endless cerulean of the sky with an exhausted huff.\n\nHis mind casts back to his youth, in the city of Akalšes. To his fathers words, of Surakel, and the legacy of his people. The duty the Suncrown gnolls had to the garden, to protect and shelter it against their demonic kin. Once, he was a welcome member of his community. Until Azkabar came, and suddenly, he who was more pious than any, was just another monster.\n\nKron lets his eyes close, as he thinks of the stories his mother told him, of red flames, holding back hellfire.\n\nIt is days until a patrol finds his body, and they simply laugh."

Political instability ravaged the land, followed by hordes of foul monsters of the dark, and heretics- practically the same thing- and when things were at their worst, hundreds of thousands of goblins burst free of the Serpent's Reach and devastated the lands of Bahar, leading to many fine Bulwari being subjugated by these monsters. This was a failure of the dwarves, who could not hold these locusts within their caves, and though their punishment will be great indeed, it falls to us to rectify their mistake.

A score of soldiers march, secure and detached in the knowledge they are doing the will of Surakel.\n\nThe goblins merely watch the coming rattle of guns and cannons with despair. Another home lost. Another place driven from, for actions done centuries before their times. Some even still have the strength to fear.\n\nThere is one command shouted to them “Leave.”\n\nMost simply do, escorted roughly away, to the borders of Bulwar, to be sent away. A better fate than those who try to resist.\n\nAt the back of the column two soldiers talk. “Do you ever think that there could have been a place for them in Surakel’s light?” The other pauses and thinks “I think this was his will.
