 castonath_patricians_events.1.desc:0 "Apparently, one of our patrols in the city of Castonath has stumbled on a most gruesome sight. The food stores in one of the palaces of the patricians - filled to the brim with [Root.Culture.GetName] flesh, frozen and quartered! Of course, our appalled patrol killed the patrician residents immediately and burned the entire place down. According to the patrol, the patricians spat out some venomous words and outed some compatriots. Apparently, this practice was pervasive and appeared at the zenith of the Greentide, when Castonath's food supply broke down and the patricians were 'forced' to find alternative source of sustenance. With no evidence left from the burned palace, we have no way of gathering evidence or checking our patrol's word - surely even the worst of humans would not stoop to the horrific act of eating an intelligent species flesh! But at the same time, how else could they have survived Castonath's long period of occupation during the Greentide?"

Such infestations are usually easily taken care of by our patrols or by independent clans who decide to take matters into their own hands. As a weed not killed at its root, however, some of these pockets spiral into great trouble. A powerful patrician has decided to take it one step further and has outwardly declared control over a couple blocks of the city, daring us to rein them in. They've dug in with a large contingent of hired muscle, and their fortifications will likely make taking the street back expensive in blood."

Some are let go freely, especially those who only leave with the clothes on their backs, but others we 'detain' for a healthy few days until they agree to give up a healthy portion of their valuables.
