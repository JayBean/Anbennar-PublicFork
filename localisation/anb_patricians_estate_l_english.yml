The food stores in one of the palaces of the patricians - filled to the brim with [Root.Culture.GetName] flesh, frozen and quartered! Of course, our appalled patrol killed the patrician residents immediately and burned the entire place down. According to the patrol, the patricians spat out some venomous words and outed some compatriots. Apparently, this practice was pervasive and appeared at the zenith of the Greentide, when Castonath's food supply broke down and the patricians were 'forced' to find alternative source of sustenance. With no evidence left from the burned palace, we have no way of gathering evidence or checking our patrol's word - surely even the worst of humans would not stoop to the horrific act of eating an intelligent species flesh!

As a weed not killed at its root, however, some of these pockets spiral into great trouble. A powerful patrician has decided to take it one step further and has outwardly declared control over a couple blocks of the city, daring us to rein them in.

However, the Castonath patricians argue that this would draw our attention and take away resources that could be invested instead in substantially more important areas of Castonath, namely their estates and properties in North Castonath and the Upper District.
