 favored_RC.2.d:0 "It has been five years of devotion, of spiritual search, of meditation and ritual and the dedication of your waking hours to activities that would lead you closer to understanding Castellos's divine nature. It has not always been easy, and the fervency of this personal quest has caused hardships, missed opportunities, and time that cannot be reclaimed. Despite this, there is no denying that your understanding of Castellos the All-Father has deepened.\n\nOne evening, as you pour over ledgers concerning the health of your realm, you cannot help but recall the story of the world's creation, and how Castellos's cooperation with the other deities led to the birth of the whole of the world around you. It was in concord with Uelos, Halanna, Yshtraliana, and Agrados that the continents and oceans were formed and countless races were birthed. Truly Castellos is the father of this world, and thus all people who call it home. One can only strive to turn their own small corner of this vast world into a fitting replica of that first paradise - and looking around at the land you rule, you cannot help but think that Castellos smiles on your efforts to be as benevolent a father to your people as he is to all mortals. As you go forward, you have no doubt that your connection with Castellos will make you a better, fairer, and more capable ruler."

 favored_RC.3.t:0 "Emulant - The Rightly Guided"
 favored_RC.3.d:0 "No man is an island, and among the gods this is doubly true. While Castellos rules the collection of deities that are bound together in the Regent Court, the king of the gods is far from all-powerful. After Castellos was maimed saving Adean from the dragon Malliath's maw, his time away from his throne has been minimal. Despite his lack of mobility, however, Castellos is still an effective and well-respected ruler, for he knows that only a fool fails to rely on the talents of those around him, and the deities of the Regent Court report to Castellos on the many tasks he has set forth for them. In this way, though Castellos may have only one hand, he can draw back the bow or raise the sword through Falah and Adean. Though he has but one leg, his will can reach as far as Munas can sail and Nathalyne can flit.\n\nIt is this last thought that strikes you as you hold court today and look upon the petitioners and courtiers who have come before you. Diplomats, businessmen, officers - what a diversity of skills exists in this room, just a small sample of that to be found in the realm. They remind you of silver tongued Minara, shrewd Ara, brave Adean - a host of great beings to govern the heavens, aiding Castellos in his just rule. No ruler can know every detail of a land or specialize in every topic in the world, and history is littered with examples of those who have micromanaged their realms into oblivion. No - Castellos is surely guiding you today, his gentle hand bringing together this collection of talented individuals. With the help of those in your court you will be well advised and ensure the just governance of your realm - just as the regent court, working together in harmony, capably administers the heavens."

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had been reading one of the latest tomes out of Konwell, and thought to stop when the sun went down, but instead continued in the moonlight's glow. Now, though, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] simply watches the city below [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\nWhat does the Dame illuminate? On this night, for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the answers are manifold. A tree, its leaves gilded in silver, rustling in the wind. A merchant, trundling onwards on her next journey. A city, resting, yet thriving.\n\nBut there is more, too. A confidence that there is a system, a logic, underneath all these phenomena. There is a reason why the tree grows the way it does, an economic explanation to the path that has brought the merchant here and the one she shall follow in the days and years to come, forces which generate the still-blowing wind. And even, perhaps, a system of truths and reasons that underpin the thriving of [Root.GetName] itself, that (it seems tonight) could perhaps even be teased apart, understood, under the guidance and light of the Dame.\n\nAnd then there is the final truth, that appears to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] even as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finally proceeds to bed: knowledge should be pursued for its own sake, for the true beauty of the world lies in understanding it. But this is more than just a truth: it is a path forward in emulation of the Dame, a principle to organize a life and a state around, and that is what [Root.Monarch.GetName] resolves to do."

The peddlers have come to their stalls once again, hawking their goods and shouting over each other in the great cacophony of bustling economy. Families have come to buy from the assorted vendors, their children darting between the stalls and mothers and fathers haggle and attempt to wrangle their children at once. As you look across the sea of faces here, you are struck by the many individuals who you see here. What a collection of peoples, living peacefully, here, in this moment! It is a small thing in life, but you cannot help but feel pride swell in your heart as you consider this community, many of whom would not be here if not for the policies that you had helped nurture.\n\nWhile many realms tolerate the arrival of other peoples and the intermixing of cultures, few have promoted it as you have. In many ways, you feel that your willingness to embrace other peoples has been divinely guided, and that The Dame has acted throughout your life to provide you an open mind and welcoming arms. Today, watching the market, you consider the goddess - once, The Dame was only the goddess of the Harvest, until she inherited the mantle of Magic from her mother. Then, when Auci Eightborn, avatar of The Dame, welcomed Munas and his people to the shores of Dameria those many centuries ago, could it have been imagined what kind of society would arise from her generosity? The intermingling and intermarriage of elves and humans has defined the politics of Cannor since the landing in the year 1000 AA, and because of the open-mindedness of her avatar The Dame has taken yet another mantle - that of xenophilia, of tolerance, of peace. And as her emulant, you will make it your mission to keep all cultures and peoples safe and welcome until the day you die."

Not every ruler would deign to involve themselves in the education of their own children, let alone those of the courtiers and lesser nobles who lived at the palace, but your years of devotion to Esmaryal had brought you great appreciation for mentoring the children around you. When you finish the lesson and dismiss them, you cannot help but watch with joy as they scatter, some running off with their friends, others heading to duties around the palace. A few stay behind to ask a question or clarify a point. In all of this, you feel the mother Esmaryal touching you, givng patience to match the eagerness of youth, wisdom to fill their minds with honor and knowledge.

You meant to withdraw from them only briefly, but as you stand at the window of this small side room you cannot help but reflect on the flames flickering in the hearth before you. The flame here is so fragile - a strong wind might even now extinguish it - but it brings such warmth and joy to life. This flame here is like the friends and family, and you would do whatever it took to keep them safe. Your many years of devotion to Esmaryal have taught you the importance of family, and there is nothing else in this world that you would put before those who are you call kin.\n\nBeyond the window, you can see the flickering of firelight in many homes beyond the limits of your residence, and a new thought comes to you. Are not these people who call you leader your family as well? As you shepherd them, you cannot help but condsider them as children, and no worthy parent would ever let their children come to harm. Indeed, this whole land is filled with your family, their lives as fragile as an exposed flame. It is up to you to ensure that this is a realm of peace and prosperity, where your beloved family can find meaning and joy and love with families of their own.

It had been a successful hunt - a week of baying hounds, horse chases, and displays of great skill with bow and spear - and now was the time to celebrate. Your companions toasted and laughed around you, the day's trophies roasting over the fire. There was great joy here in the aftermath of the hunt, the exhaltation of the brotherhood of hunters, but the celebration tonight cannot help but compare with the exhileration of the hunt itself. As the flames of the bonfire grow higher, your mind drifts to the thrill that you have felt over the last several days - tracking the elusive rabbit, chasing the fleeing deer on horseback, standing fast against the charging boar. In each of these moments your senses and intuition have been taxed to their limits, and in those moments you have felt a sense of connection with the world like never before. To be awakened to all of nature, pitting yourself against the beasts of the wood, was more intoxicating than the strongest wine.\n\nHaving felt thus, you cannot help but consider Falah, the greatest of all hunters, who slew the progenitors of the monsters in penance for her father's sins. Was her hunt like yours, a celebration of physicality and instinct? Was it the retributive chase of a bounty hunter, bringing in a bount for a reward? The duty of putting down a rabid animal before it could harm those you love? And is the connection that you feel with the natural world felt double by Falah, whose mother died birthing her and became the bones of the world that she now protects? Keen-eyed Falah, whose bow is true - what does she feel when she looses her arrows, you wonder.\n\nYour companions shake you from your reverie and return you to the festivities. There would be time to contemplate and connect with Falah again in the coming days, during your future hunts, but today was a day for companionship and celebration."

You have walked many such places over the past several years, taking in the sounds and scents of the natural world far from the towns and cities where mortals tend to congregate. Following brooks, dunes, woods - you have traveled all these ways, and as you have walked and surveyed the health of the natural places of your realm you have had ample time to think on your relationship with the goddess Falah.\n\nShe is not only the huntress of beasts and monsters, but also patron of places wild and untrodden by mortal foot, where beasts of the earth and sky congregate unmolested by the ever-hungry tendrils of civilization. Many know Falah as a hunter who drives back the dangerous creatures of the world - but she is a force not of destruction, but balance. Who else provides shelter to the mother bear and her cubs in winter? Who tends the wild berries as they blossom in the early summer, or guides migrating geese to safety at the next pond on their long trips? Falah protects all the creatures of the world, for she knows that the land itself must be nourished and protected for all creatures to thrive. This is a message oft forgotten by mortals, but it is not a lesson that you will fail to remember. As long as you draw breath, your realm will work in balance with the wilds of the world - and in tending to these places, your people will find that the wilds care for those who care for them."

 favored_RC.14.d:0 "Nerat teaches us that the power of life and death is the greatest power vested in mortal rulers. The authority to exercise justice, mete out punishment, and sentence the guilty is a great responsibility and, at times, a burden, for he who hands down the sentence is responsible for every swing of the sword, just or no. This is the thought that lingers in your mind as you finally sit down, the sun dipping below the horizon. Since the break of dawn, you have heard the testimony and legal arguments about a murder case that has taken place in the capital. Over a dozen witnesses place the accused murderer at the scene of his wife's death, and report that he was covered in blood when guards arrived to respond to the shouts of passers-by, but no one saw him commit the crime itself. The accused man continuously claims his innocence, but says almost nothing more - he gives no alibi, explanation, or alternative suspects.\n\nThe decision of whether to sentence this man hangs heavily on you - there is clearly a lack of definitive evidence, but why does the accused not fight harder to demonstrate his innocence? The circumstances are highly suspicious, but still... Your hand rests on your pen, hesitating. There is no certainty here, and it is very easy to sentence an innocent or release a murderer. What would Nerat do? Certainly the Jailor of the Damned has always known the guilt of his charges... but did he? Were all of the Archdevils so unequivocably evil? And what of Nerat and Falah - they stood accused alongside Agrados' other children, yet were shown innocent. What wisdom of the gods reveals what dwells in the hearts of men, you wonder.\n\nYou spend the evening in a mix of prayer and pouring over past legal decisions. As the first rays of dawn break over the horizon, you return to your desk, dip your pen into the ink well and sign your name at the bottom of the document. Judgement is yours to deliver - and when you pass from this world and stand before Nerat, he will judge you for your deeds. You can only hope that you have done justice today."

The disease had swept through the village quickly, and many had died before the call for aid had reached the doctors and healers of the larger communities and a response was organized. Your long devotion to Nerat had led you to know many in the medical community, and you had spent many long hours in discussion and service alongside the trained medica of the realm. After gathering several local doctors to travel to the afflicted hamlet, you accompanied them here to assist in the response. Some in your court protested - by putting yourself in contact with the disease, you were being reckless, they claimed - but you brushed them off. Rulers have ridden to war to defend their people since time immemmorial - how is helping your ill subjects any more dangerous?\n\nNow you moved about the room, placing cold rags on the heads of the feverish, bringing water to the coughing and sitting by the ill as they attempted to sleep. This room you sat in now was very much a realm at the intersection of life and death - and here, today, you could feel Nerat as if he sat next to you, the skeletal figure waiting for mortals to breathe their last and come to their final judgement. So few understood Nerat - they feared him as the god of death, chainer of demons, incorruptable killer of the unhallowed - but you knew better. Nerat alone of the gods truly understands mortality and the fear that springs from it, and so he patronizes those who attempt to ease the suffering of their kin, to let them pass into death in peace. These poor folk did not deserve to be afflicted by disease - but it had come for them all the same, and Nerat had come to their misery, both to guide the hands of the doctors who worked to save them and to shelter the souls of the departed.

Many an hour you had spent sparring, dining, and discussing with these great warriors, many of whom were the younger sons and daughters of families of high standing throughout the realm. Though they wore stoic faces now, if you were to flash them a smile you know that you might evoke a reaction, for these were your noble and chivalric brethren, who were as dedicated to you as you were to them. Many times you have toasted each other's health, ridden into battle together, and emerged from the crucible of war together, stronger. When you have been wounded, they have rescued you; When one of you has fallen, the rest have borne the body of their noble companion away.\n\nMemories of these deeds of triumph and sacrifice cannot help but bring to mind Adean's righteous charge against Malliath in the Godswar - undaunted by the terrible flames of the great dragon, Adean plunged forward to drive back his father's foremost foe, only to find himself overwhelmed. But when his demise looked certain, suddenly Castellos was there, flinging Adean from the dragon's maw, though he paid a most grievous price to save his only son.\n\nYou find your knights looking at you, their faces impassive but their eyes intense, waiting for a word form their commander.

Settling these disputes is far from anyone's favorite topic, but you are readier than most to take it on, knowing that Adean's hand guides you and gives you the wisdom to properly untangle these various challenges. Most who follow him focus on Adean's aspects as a warrior, but you have come to understand that the firstborn of Castellos is not solely focused on knighthood, but defends the entire apparatus of chivalry, feudalism, and the relationship of a government to its people. One by one, you have sorted the seemingly endless contradictions tangled up in the realm. You may never finish the task.

Those poor misguided fools who had not experienced divine grace! Who would go the whole of their lives without witnessing the absolute redeeming love the Ryala revealed before you that morning! Who chose to worship war, instead of a power far greater - one that could make the mightiest of sovereigns shed tears, that had led countless men and women to throw away their lives across time! War may come to the realms of men, but to worship a god of war foremost? No, that way was the folly of the worldly.\n\nAfter a moment that seemed like it lasted for eternity the sun shifted, and as quickly as the resplendant presence had come upon [Root.Monarch.GetName], it vanished, and Ryala was gone, leaving only the statue of her likeness behind. For a moment, the tears of joy and love threatened to turn bitter at the sudden absence of the goddess, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] wiped them from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cheek before they could fall. Those who saw [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] say that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] moved with a grace sublime and a certainty unquestionable, and from that day the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] never again doubted the power of absolute love, nor its supremacy over the little power of war."

The first, a gnomish scholar of The Thought, smirked as he stood before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], eager to make show of his knowledge of the universe, by pitting it against the rhetoric of his opponent, an upstart street philosopher from [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\n'You speak of the city as were it an entity in itself,' the gnome said. 'But the city is merely what we call this collection of people and structures, and does their beauty individually match that of the city as a whole?'\n\nThe philosopher considered the words before speaking. 'Not so, to consider the sum of all within the city and the city as one whole is an impossible comparison. The city transcends what makes it.'\n\nThe gnome scoffed. 'Do we transcend our bodies then? We can only understand the whole once we know what makes it.'\n\n'But in turn can we only understand what makes the whole once we understand it to be a part of the whole.' The philosopher countered. 'To reason away the beauty of your wife because you know her to be bones, blood and flesh, is as much to blind yourself as is the opposite.'\n\nIn the coming days, [Root.Monarch.GetName] found [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] contemplating the words of the philosopher on more than one occasion. Indeed, are beauty and love not the most miraculous things of all? Parts of life that by themselves are worthless or unendurable are made joyous when joined together with those most vital of emotions. Love has so entranced men that history is dotted with tales of those who have thrown away their lives in pursuit of its sublime perfection, and empires have crumbled from their puruit of passion. Not even the gods can resist this force; that wielded by Ryala, whose demure nature underlies her strength - for of all the gods, the one who plucks the strings of the human heart may be the mightiest of them all."

Sharp voices speak while a figure cowers, cornered and alone. Shaking as towering tyrants loom above, the small being knows that it will certainly be destroyed. [Root.Monarch.GetName] grits their teeth, jaw clenched tight at the injustice of it - of darkness that comes for the innocent, and a world that fails to defend them.\n\nThe vision shifts, and you can see a knight kneeling before the cowering being from before.

Had it been just a dream? Or something more? Impossible to say, perhaps... but as the rest fades, one thought stays, clear and loud as a rining bell: Stand. Arise. Defend the weak.

Stone, shelter, warmth - the meaning of home and safety. Not one person deserves any less. How could the kingdom stand if negligence were to let its walls crumble, and the wolves slip through? How could [Root.Monarch.GetName] claim to be a just monarch if they were to let honeyed words and lust for coin come before solid foundations?

Many peasants had vanished in the area, and many days of tracking and investigation had led to this cave. Whatever monsters laid inside, they would not leave. One by one, the adventuring company drew their weapons and torches and made their way inside.\n\nMany hours would pass as the company delved below, striking at the monstrous heart of evil that lay beneath the surface before making their escape back to the surface. Bursting into the sunlight as the stones of that wretched cave shuddered and crumbled behind [Root.Monarch.GetName], the adventurers flung themselves into the grass. For a moment, the only sound was the panting of exhausted warriors who barely escaped death. Then, from [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s lips, a laugh, a smile breaking across their face, as they looked around to their companions. The laughter spread like a rolling wave across the exhausted heroes, and soon enough all were roaring with the great comic joy of life, triumph, and exhaustion. They sat there, soaking in the coolness of the morning dew, exalting in victory. Is this what it is like, to be a hero, [Root.Monarch.GetName] wondered? Those foul creatures had taken so many lives in the area and now, by [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s hand, they were no more. Is this how Corin felt, when she slew the Dookanson? Had these valiant adventurers become [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s own circle of companions?\n\nIt truly felt wonderous, to take the world into one's own hands and see things set right by the work of blade and bravery. By the time [Root.Monarch.GetName] returned to court, news of the victory had already started to spread. Soon enough, the incredible tale of the adventure was told in every tavern in [Root.GetName]. Most every fashionable merchant, trendy noble, bold priest could thereafter be seen trying their hand with a weapon, blades deftly dancing all through the courtyards as they sought to mimic [Root.Monarch.GetName] and try their hand in plying the trade of Corin's justice."

Some would say that adventurers are a necessary evil and it is beneath the dignity of a sovereign to playact as one. But Lothane knows that it is his duty as Corin's successor to fight back against the vile things that lurk in the shadows. Such evils have led Lothane to the yawning portal that opens before him, a great gash in the earth that looms ominous before him and the adventurers who he'd gathered for the expedition. Many peasants had vanished in the area, and many days of tracking and investigation had led to this cave. Whatever monsters laid inside, they would not leave.

The laughter spread like a rolling wave across the exhausted heroes, and soon enough all were roaring with the great comic joy of life, triumph, and exhaustion. They sat there, soaking in the coolness of the morning dew, exalting in victory. The experience felt distantly familiar to Lothane -- and of course it was, he realized, Corin's Circle had reacted much the same way after their more-perilous adventures. Yet at the same time, those memories seemed more distant than usual, less wistful. Looking at the men and women around him, they seemed to him every bit the heroes that the Circle had been. Lying on the grass, eyes toward the skies, a piece of Lothane relaxed that had been tight for a long, long, time.\n\nIt truly felt wondrous, to once again take the world into his own hands and see things set right, assisted by trusted friends. Though ruling [Root.GetName] still took up most of his time, Lothane would often find occasion to meet up with the party again, and occasionally joined them on missions as well. While some complained about the risk to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s life, and the time spent away from [Root.Capital.GetName], none can deny that his mind seems sharper and more energetic than it was before. And perhaps someday, if he takes a moment before rejoining the party in a busy tavern, he might realize those adventurers speak of him in just the way he speaks of Corin."

Above, a shadow approached - more than a shadow perhaps, though the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could not discern more than a flash of red hair, their vision spun so.\n\n'Come now, [Root.Monarch.GetName]! I expect better of you than that.' A woman's voice spoke clear, strong and kind. 'From the top, now.' Pulling [Root.Monarch.GetName] to their feet, the red-haired knight struck again as soon as they had readied themself, and once more planted the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] firmly upon the ground with a masterful maneuver. The red-haired woman chuckled. "Remember, you must be prepared for any threat. Tighten that guard up, or you'll have a blade in under it, understand, your Grace?'\n\n'Your Grace?'\n\n'Your Grace, are you alright?' The words reach [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ears as if through water, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes open to a bright, dizzying world. The soldiers in the yard pull the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to their feet - they had been laying there for some time, but after many assurances to their health the soldiers left [Root.Monarch.GetName] to contemplate what they had seen.\n\nSome whispered that Corin herself had blessed the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with Her presence that day in the training yard, though others would readily dismiss those rumors as foolish chatter. Still, none could deny that after that day, certain techniques had slipped into [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s sparring that have been catching even the most well-trained opponents off guard. And, better yet, these moves have begun to disseminate down the ranks, taking to the army like a flame to kindling. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is invigorated, seeming to have just the right thing to say at every meeting of arms, the brightest ideas at the finest moment."

Their sparring continued until it was time for Corin to meet with the Marcher Lords, but before leaving, Corin gestured for Lothane to come with her.\n\n"Impressive!", Lothane congratulated her. "I've never seen techniques like those before."\n\n"That's the problem", Corin replied. "Ever since I returned from death with these powers, I've started to forget how to fight as a human. Almost nothing of what I showed was useful to them. I should have let you do the teaching." Corin hesitated for a moment, before pressing on: "I want you to accompany me to the meeting."\n\nLothane had never met with the Marcher Lords before, but he trusted Corin's decision. He knew the topic at hand. Corin planned to enter the Deepwoods for reinforcements, and the Marcher Lords needed to handle her absence. Despite his nervousness, Lothane could just sit back and watch as the meeting proceeded. Or so he thought, until Corin pointed to him. "I don't know how long my mission will be, but until I return I expect you to follow Lothane as you now follow me." Lothane's mind went blank, and his tongue numb. Ignoring the eyes now upon him, he staggered to his feet. Corin turned towards him, her face not that of a commander or avatar, but of a friend. "I know great rulers and brilliant commanders, but none whose heart I can trust more than yours. Will you lead them in my absence, Lothane?"\n\n"Lothane?"\n\n"Lothane? Are you alright?" The words reach Lothane's ears as if through water, and his eyes open to a bright, dizzying world. The sergeant he had been sparring with pulled him to his feet, and after many assurances he left the recruits' remaining drills to her.  He had been instructing them like Corin once asked, but now he needed a moment alone with the memory.\n\nIt had been many years since that day, and Lothane had learnt much about both ruling and commanding. But was his heart still the same? Lothane wasn't sure. But whether it was pristine or blackened, he would forever give the same answer he had given Corin all those years ago:"

They are led by Aldermen, Clergy, Landless Knights and Respected Women. Led by common farmers or craftsmen who spoke up and made their voice heard.

Tired and worn down you stopped that evening, hours short of the noble household you were meant to stay the night in. Instead you found yourself approached by a small figure, perhaps a child in rough hewn clothes, a small leather hunting sling at their side but no weapon to truly threaten you. They called down with offers of food, and something bid you to follow. They danced ahead just a little out of your reach, until you arrived at a humble festival of local farming folk, a short way off the beaten track. An immense pot of stew was on the fire for any hungry folk to take from, and cheap but honest ale was poured from open casks. Rabbit from the woods and fish from the rivers was slowly being grilled with wild herbs, and young boys and girls ran around the edges of the party gleefully playing kiss-chase and tag and teasing each other through their childish grins. When you left the party in the early hours of the morning to return to your horse you were full and merry, but the next time you came along that road you could not find that village again. Still the memory will always stay with you, of hwo even in dark times, a little charity and some honest friends can give even the most exhausted the strength to face the day."
