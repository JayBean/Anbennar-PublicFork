 Y26_march_north_title: "March North"
 Y26_march_north_desc: "Sziangnu occupies a strategically important position on the Yanhe river. Controlling it would allow us to control the entire river. The lands around the city would serve well as a base for further expeditions northwards. While this campaign is happening, state agents will begin working on preparing a small naval expedition to Daengun; this will not require the central government's attention beyond approving the venture. . "
 
 Y26_bulwark_in_the_north_title: "Bulwark in the North"
 Y26_bulwark_in_the_north_desc: "Who could forget the bird-riders? They have menaced Yanshen for many, many years through brutal, wide-reaching raids. It has only gotten worse after the Faceless Queen united the tribes and directed their internecine aggression outwards. A bastion to watch for further raids will protect Yinquan well into the future. A few forts have already been built for that purpose, they just need to be improved upon. When that is complete, it would be an apt time to see how the expedition fleet has fared."
 
 Y26_the_march_on_mulim_title: "The March on Mulim"
 Y26_the_march_on_mulim_desc: "The Mulim forest is traditionally part of Yinquan. There can be no other stewards for its woodlands. Even though the Divine Call dynasty have been able administrators, their presence only divides our homeland. No longer! Their dynasty can be allowed to exist, but the state that it rules needs to be destroyed - see to it. The woods will provide a good jumping point to any greater acts."
 
 Y26_reuniting_our_woods_title: "Reuniting our Woods"
 Y26_reuniting_our_woods_desc: "With Mulim fully incorporated into our state, it would be fair to say that Yinquan now has the power to properly assert itself across Yanshen. In a land divided by fragmentary warlords, being able to unite even a small corner grants our state a vast advantage. The world awaits!"
 
 Y26_reunion_of_siblings_title: "Reunion of Siblings"
 Y26_reunion_of_siblings_desc: "Before the Day of Ashen Skies, Yinquan was part of Kohai. The relationship was akin to a mother-daughter relationship. Now that we have grown larger, it has become something of a sister-sister relationship - resurrecting these old ties in a new fashion will aid the state considerably."
 
 Y26_suzerainty_of_the_yanhe_title: "Suzerainty of the Yanhe"
 Y26_suzerainty_of_the_yanhe_desc: "The capture of Tianlou is paramount to hegemony over the Yanhe. Nearly all trade in the region passes through the Jewel of Yanshen, and while campaigning to the city we can capture the rest of that trade - the wealth inherent to such a monopoly should be obvious. Of course, there are rumors of a terrible truth behind the venerable High Temples... but that can be investigated after Tianlou is conquered!"
 
 Y26_dominance_in_the_north_title: "Dominance in the North"
 Y26_dominance_in_the_north_desc: "No more games! Northern Yanshen is subject to Yinquan only, from the Mulim forest to the Jewel to even the venerable Yanhe - they all bend the knee!, we have become a major player in the chessboard of Haless, perhaps not on the level of the Command or even the Raj, yet formidable to any lesser! It is about time to move south..."
 
 Y26_the_city_of_shrines_title: "The City of Shrines"
 Y26_the_city_of_shrines_desc: "Tsingchunquan is but a glimmer under the shadow of vastly more opulent cities. It is unlikely that it will ever reach the heights of Tianlou or even Feiten, for they vastly outnumber us. Instead, this city ought to have its own claim to fame: Shrines. It needs more."
 
 Y26_the_land_of_a_thousand_shrines_title: "The Land of a Thousand Shrines"
 Y26_the_land_of_a_thousand_shrines_desc: "Through continual economic growth and an influx of plunder, the Mulim forest has flourished. The entire forest is now known as the land of shrines, rather than Tsingchunquan. Hundreds of shrines dot the landscape, laden with tribute for the Huli-Jing; let it become thousands!"
 
 Y26_maidens_in_the_government_title: "Maidens in the Government"
 Y26_maidens_in_the_government_desc: "Of course the Maidens of Liho will be granted a voice in the government. Have they not earned it? By guiding the faithful (and assisting in exerting control over them) the shrine maidens have done a considerable job in assisting Yinquan. Now, they jointly petition for the privilege to do it better - to formally represent the Huli-Jing in governmental affairs. It is an easy decision."
 
 Y26_lihoism_ideals_title: "Lihoism Ideals"
 Y26_lihoism_ideals_desc: "Liho's maidens have managed to establish themselves on every level of the nation from spiritual to political. The dominant religious strain of the Righteous Path in Yinquan is a particularly fox-reverent sect known as Lihoism, named in honor of the maidens who labor to spread its principles. It is time the maidens be given what they truly desire. Yinquan's current government will cease to exist, and instead be replaced by a faithfully Lihoist theocracy. The aristocracy might complain, but the matters of the spirit care little for worldly power."
 
 Y26_enlightenment_title: "Enlightenment"
 Y26_enlightenment_desc: "Our control of the Maidens of Liho affords our state some degree of influence over the Righteous Path community. Whatever we dictate can be made common religious dogma. In this circumstance, it is about enlightenment - the enlightenment of the self through the careful, thoughtful detachment of mortal qualms. It is only in this state that one can act at their best, for it is only here that one can be unburdened by what happens around them. Naturally, spreading this doctrine to the common folk will help lessen their objections to our state doing what it needs to."
 
 Y26_the_righteous_pilgrimage_title: "The Righteous Pilgrimage"
 Y26_the_righteous_pilgrimage_desc: "The hotsprings of Yinquan are famed for their comfort and accessibility. What if they were also famed for their ability to rejuvenate the chi of those who partake in them? Should we have the right contacts in the Xia, word could potentially spread of the mystical regenerative properties of these hotsprings, potent enough to justify a proper pilgrimage route. With tolls, of course."
 
 Y26_peasant_relations_title: "Peasant Relations"
 Y26_peasant_relations_desc: "Lanjinhui is constantly looking for allies to secure their flanks, even if they currently hold the advantage against Jiangdu. Siding with impotent peasants is not an easy feat, but it is an unfortunate reality best set aside for now. They need allies, and so do we - the rest can be settled later on.."
 
 Y26_seizing_control_title: "Seizing Control"
 Y26_seizing_control_desc: "Though ostensibly a republic of equals, it is an open secret that Lanjinhui is ruled by a shadow government, the Nincishi. To have control of the Nincishi is to rule Lanjinhui. We have been equal partners on the world stage for some time now, but this does not reflect our growing grace and power. We would never openly act against our long-time allies. Instead, we will use their own council against them - installing a few friendly agents will bring them to see the value of Yinquan's patronage."
 
 Y26_scheming_vulpines_title: "Scheming Vulpines"
 Y26_scheming_vulpines_desc: "Through the timely assistance of the Huli-Jing (well versed in trickery of all sorts), the Nincishi has been entirely brought under the control of Yinquan agents! The guile of these fox-women spirits is not to be underestimated. This control of Lanjinhui affords us the right to dismantle their government and integrate it into the greater Yinquan administration. It's about time."
 
 Y26_across_the_spear_sea_title: "Across the Spear Sea"
 Y26_across_the_spear_sea_desc: "Daengun lies on the other end of the Spear Sea. They were forced into isolation from the continual pressure of the bird-riders who menace their borders. Even though they are but a (relatively) short ship's trip away, all of Yanshen had more pressing matters than reconnecting with their lost brethren. Now, the Huli-Jing have whispered to us of their sisters in Daengun, the legalistic Gumiho. We have a duty to reconnect."
 
 Y26_the_shuvuushi_threat_title: "The Shuvuushi Threat"
 Y26_the_shuvuushi_threat_desc: "All things considered, there really are very few things separating us from Daengun, both geographically and politically. However, these problems make up for their number in their magnitude. The Shuvuushudi bird riders make nearly all land travel impossible, for their carnivorous birds can waylay just about anything they come across. Since sea travel is not desirable, we have only one option: pacify the entirety of the northern lands. Culling their birds will see the Shuvuushudi rendered impotent forever."
 
 Y26_trained_eyes_on_the_western_dragon_title: "Trained Eyes of the Western Dragon"
 Y26_trained_eyes_on_the_western_dragon_desc: "The Yanshin league lies to our west, but they are irrelevant in the scale of things. Our greatest foe is the would-be hegemon of Bianfang, the White Dragon, the domain of the tyrant. No words ought to be spent on singing their praises. Their state must be cast down and obliterated, regardless of what it costs to cast their kingdom to oblivion."
 
 Y26_establishing_the_shrine_of_hundred_thousand_lanterns_title: "Establishing the Shrine of Hundred Thousand Lanterns"
 Y26_establishing_the_shrine_of_hundred_thousand_lanterns_desc: "The one thing that truly establishes the certainty of faith is scale. If our faith in the Huli-Jing is insufficient, then we will be doomed to stagnation as our gifts do not grow to match the grace of our patron. There is a solution: A shrine of impossibly large scale shall see us proven sufficiently dedicated for a long time into the future. A hundred thousand lanterns (or enough to seem that way, at least) will be lit in a complex which will stretch for miles around. There will be nothing like it in all of Yanshen - no, in all of Haless! "
 
 Y26_dragon_tamed_title: "Dragon Tamed"
 Y26_dragon_tamed_desc: "The symbolic value of Bianfang's capture cannot be overstated. Tearing up the dragon-headed banner of our grandest foe represents the triumph of the fox over the dragon; the supremacy of Yinquan along the Yanhe; the unification of Yanshen under one banner. With the region beaten or governed into submission, the time has come to rebuild. War has defined the region for too long. What will become of it when it can be dedicated to peace?"
 
 Y26_flow_of_wine_title: "Flow of Wine"
 Y26_flow_of_wine_desc: "The speciality rice wine of Yinquan, Mijiu, has become hegemonic in its popularity across Yanshen for obvious reasons. Many inferior replicas have appeared all across the country, for the current production of Mijiu is simply insufficient to keep up with demand - even the Huli-Jing grow thirsty! More must be brewed, for all in Yanshen must have their fill and the Huli-Jing triple besides!"
 
 Y26_the_rice_quota_title: "The Rice Quota"
 Y26_the_rice_quota_desc: "Obviously the state takes a share of rice harvests. It is not only a helpful way to tax peasants who cannot spare their labor, but it has another benefit: Rice wine, provided directly from the state to the thirsty stomachs of the Huli-Jing. It will be to everyone's benefit to increase the amount of rice produced. New harvest methods and farming techniques have been pioneered in recent years. Perhaps employing those will increase the output of the farmers and in turn increase the goods we can tax?"
 
 Y26_pleasing_the_huli_jing_title: "Pleasing the Huli Jing"
 Y26_pleasing_the_huli_jing_desc: "There is an unfathomable amount of alcohol making its way through our realm, enough to draw the envy of even the most inebriated dwarf. As arranged through the rice quota, much of it goes into the hands of the state. The Huli-Jing have had an insatiable thirst for alcohol, but perhaps it is only insatiable because they have not had enough of it. We will turn over this grand stockpile to the foxes!"
 
 Y26_rebirth_of_our_saviour_title: "Rebirth of Our Saviour"
 Y26_rebirth_of_our_saviour_desc: "With the temples destroyed and the estranged Gumiho and Holi-Jing reunited, the great Huszien might finally be brought back into existence. It seems as if her very existence was shattered into myriad fragments, taking the forms of the fox spirits we know now. By bringing them all together into a great hall and performing the correct rituals, Huszien might finally be brought back onto Halann. The mistake of an era, undone!"
 
 Y26_trade_along_the_jellyfish_coast_title: "Trade Along the Jellyfish Coast"
 Y26_trade_along_the_jellyfish_coast_desc: "There is nearly nothing like seeing the Jellyfish Coast by night, watching the countless underwater lanterns swim by with ethereal elegance. The only thing to improve the scene is the carefully crafted hull of a merchantman laden with cargo. It is much more valuable, too. Securing this trade route will do Yinquan well. "
 
 Y26_the_blacksmiths_of_zyuiyut_title: "The Blacksmiths of Zyuiyut"
 Y26_the_blacksmiths_of_zyuiyut_desc: "The island of Ginjyu is host to a number of continent-famous blacksmiths. Though these smiths do not have a particular name, what they create does: the Moshugong swords. These legendary blades do not need their praises sung any more than they already have. By the guile of the Maidens of Liho and the clever trickery of the Huli-Jing, it should be possible to convince the blacksmiths of Ginjyu to make these swords for our own army. A lot of infrastructure and even more smiths will be necessary to staff an entire military, but the benefits for doing so are incredible."
 
 Y26_jellyfish_coast_taken_title: "Jellifish Coast Taken"
 Y26_jellyfish_coast_taken_desc: "Yanshen's coast lies under a single flag - Yinquan's. With most of the trade up and down the coastal ports going through land controlled by our state, we are able to reap the profits as the merchants do business with the ease of a single code of laws and regulations. As celebration, we will host a festival in Feiten where thousands of lanterns will be lit and released into the air. The sky will be lit by these lanterns in the same way that the sea is lit up by the jellyfish."
 
 Y26_mastering_the_chi_title: "Mastering the Chi"
 Y26_mastering_the_chi_desc: "True masters, those able to use chi to achieve the fullest abilities of the self, are rare. Many who are able to do so are greedy with their knowledge, as if teaching others would lessen their ability to channel their chi. Thankfully we are now able to fix this, for countless battles have created a sizable class of masters. With the help of the venerable Huli-Jing, it should not be very difficult to create an institution to ensure that this knowledge is not lost with the misfortune of a well-aimed bullet."
 
 Y26_the_xianjie_brethren_title: "The Xianjie Brethren"
 Y26_the_xianjie_brethren_desc: "We are friends with the monks of the Xia - their apprentices frequent our hotsprings even as pilgrims cross back and forth in the search of one holy site or another. That is why - the foxes whisper to us - we need to unify them if not by peace then by force. Friends cannot last in this cruel world, but subjects can; Think of it like this: It can only be by our hands that the monks of the Xia can be subjugated, yet still preserved. This must be done. It must be so."
 
 Y26_shrines_of_the_xia_title: "Shrines of the Xia"
 Y26_shrines_of_the_xia_desc: "Even though the Huli-Jing are the primary objects of our reverence, this does not mean that the other spirits of Haless are not worthy of worship! Soldiers and scouts moving through the Xia have yielded maps and reports of countless temples and smaller shrines, with nearly every one dedicated to a different patron or protector spirit. We must encourage the free worship of these other spirits so as to affirm our brotherly relationship with the monks of the Xia. "

 flavour_yinquan.0.title: "Great Ancestor"
 flavour_yinquan.0.desc: "With the previous Great Maiden of Liho deceased, the time has come to nominate a new maiden for the position! Some have already taken the tests necessary to prove themselves worthy of the position. One will be selected and venerated above the rest as a living ancestor, one who has the spiritual experience of many lifetimes, one who has achieved a level of enlightenment most mortal beings could only dream of! We will celebrate their ascension with a few days of festivities."

 flavour_yinquan.15.title: "The Temples: Something is Wrong"
 flavour_yinquan.15.desc: "Dread news, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! The Huli-Jing have informed the state of the troubles they face when trying to leave the Mulim forest. Apparently, when leaving the treeline, the Holi-Jing are struck by blinding headaches and full-body weakness, lingering for a time once they head back into the forest. They wish to wander the countryside; this simply cannot do! This strange illness is strongest when they depart towards the northeast, towards Tianlou. Since that is now part of the state, that is where our investigation will start."
 flavour_yinquan.15.a: "This needs to be resolved. Quickly."
 
 flavour_yinquan.16.title: "The Temples: A Mistery in Tianlou"
 flavour_yinquan.16.desc: ""The adventurers contracted to explore the inner structure of the Tianlou temple complex have been stalled indefinitely due to unforeseen developments.\n\nSome of the buildings within the complex lead into a network of underground tunnels, flush with traps and assorted valuables. A few of these traps had been activated prior by careless treasure hunters, but a close encounter with one facilitated the first delay; the adventurers insisted on an incredibly slow and systematic exploration of the temple complex, so as to minimize risk to themselves.\n\nThough vast, the true extent of these tunnels cannot be determined - all tunnels converge into a single, large chamber with a magically sealed pair of doors. Blocking the door was a statue of a dragon, who appears to have nine gems carved into the anatomy of the statue, each one embossed with a different symbol.. Seven of these gems were glowing a shade of bright blue, and two more were much dimmer, periodically flickering. Nothing we have tried, magical or mundane, has been able to breach the door. The statue simply will not budge, and even if it did it is unlikely that would dispel the magic around the door. It would appear that investigating these gems is the only way to further explore the complex."\n\n- Report from captain Lin Yiu."
 flavour_yinquan.16.a: "Symbols, huh... I wonder what they could refer to."
 
 flavour_yinquan.17.title: "The Temples: Investigating the Statue"
 flavour_yinquan.17.desc: ""As was to be expected from such a deeply concealed door, its actual meaning has been lost to time. All of the temple overseers were perfectly happy to speak with us, but nearly none of them had anything productive to say about the underground door. We had more success showing the scholars sketches of the symbols found within the temple. Some, who had worked in other high temples before, were able to recognize some of the symbols as being prevalent in the murals of these smaller temples.\n\nIt would appear that all the other temples have some kind of connection to the larger complex in Tianlou. Enclosed with this report is a tentative list of what temple each of these symbols connects to, and where it is, as drafted by myself and the adventurers under my charge. There are nine points of interest, which we determined to be the symbols most prevalent in the murals: Damaogong, Jiantsiang, Lanjincun, Yanzhong, Zyugok, Lamwun, Jianxusi, and Yantagitana. I find it of note that all of these high temples are located in Yanshen."\n\n- captain Lin Yiu."
 flavour_yinquan.17.a: "With results like this, we'll have this resolved in no time..."
 
 flavour_yinquan.18.title: "Temple Investigated: [Root.GetName]"
 flavour_yinquan.18.desc1: "Identified with the symbol of three curved stripes similar to tally marks, the high temple at Damaogong was, ironically, relatively untouched until our expedition. Shuvuush raids rendered its exploration unviable, as the manpower was better spent on the frontier. As a result, the somewhat better preserved temple offered our scholars a lot of insights into the architecture of the high temples.\n\nActually productive results have been long in the making, for the highly trapped nature of the high temple made exploration slow and risky. In addition to that, attempting to pay the adventurers without allowing them to loot the temple has been difficult. While attempting to comb for traps, our expeditionaries chanced upon a hidden door. It led to a room containing a magical gem, placed within the center of a mural depicting large, horned figures fleeing from a number of smaller, less detailed figures. When trying to extract it for study, this gem was accidentally destroyed.\n\nWe will continue looking until there is a full map of the Damaogong complex, but any further deeper progress into the temple has been obstructed by doors protected with unknown wards."
 flavour_yinquan.18.desc2: "The stewards of the temple at Jiantsiang were an impressive obstacle to our investigation; it is remarkable how much a priest could delay our expedition. After much back-and-forth (which has made up the bulk of our progress reports, as you are already aware) they have finally acquiesced to our expedition.\n\nAs for the actual temple, its prevalent symbol was a pointed shape resembling one half of a star. The layout of the temple was exceedingly complex; even though the underground rooms did not seem to descend exceptionally deep, they often wrapped back around on one another. To our adventurers, it felt as if the structure was deliberately designed to render them lost and unsure. We ultimately had to resort to carvings and landmarks in order to navigate it properly.\n\nAt the end of this labyrinth we found an unknown gem similar in nature to those found elsewhere, branded with the half-star prevalent throughout the murals of the temple complex, surrounded by art of various shapes being brought, in well-detailed steps, into a number of structures shaped similarly to the high temples. The gem was brittle and weathered and shattered upon a single touch. We sketched a copy of the artwork and departed in short order; I am loath to inform some already standoffish harimari that we have broken something in their temple."
 flavour_yinquan.18.desc3: "Lanjincun is a nice enough place to reside in during the expedition. The actual temple's symbol was akin to two curves, resembling semicircles, placed alongside one another. It did not feature as prevalently in the artistry and murals, seeming more of a designation than most of the other patterns. What reason this has is unknown, though the scholars present at the expedition theorized it was because it could not be integrated into the art as well. However, it did feature a mural of a multi-tailed fox tied down by chains, each link shaped like the double-crescent.\n\nWe had no major delays exploring the temple. Even so, the wealth of information our hired scholars were able to extract from this temple forced us to wait an exceptionally long time for them to properly analyze it all. Waiting for them to pick it apart was of great use to us, though - hidden inside the temple complex was a gem with the symbol carved into it. Reports indicate that it ceased glowing after we pried it from its slot. There is a lot for us to study here, most particularly the chained fox."
 flavour_yinquan.18.desc4: "With a symbol that looked like two irregular curves with a line crossing through both, the high temple of Yanzhong held few secrets for our expedition. As seems distressingly routine, we were marred by delays and bad fortune. Our resources were drained - and our progress stalled - by a cadre of individuals interested in siphoning off as many state resources as they could get their hands on. It was only once they were caught and executed that things were able to start progressing again.\n\nThe location of a hidden gem matching the description of our objective was concealed until the traitors' quarters were searched. It was retrieved without further incident. We also retrieved a sketch of its surroundings, shaped like a number of horned figures holding up a circle. As it was carried out of the vicinity of the temple, an adventurer noted that its glow dimmed and eventually went out entirely. This letter should also include a revised table of expenses that should be updated as soon as possible."
 flavour_yinquan.18.desc5: "Our presence at the high temple of Luoyip was welcomed at first, but the reception grew notably colder over time, on account of our hired adventurers having an unfortunate habit of attempting to steal kobolds to take them as good-luck charms during their temple exploration. Obviously this was not permitted, though the resultant manpower shortage was deeply inconvenient.\n\nFeaturing prominently in the temples were motifs of a long and winding line with 3 other lines crossing through it at varying points. However, the art that caught the eye of our observing scholars (and mine as well) was a tile mural found deep in the temple, next to the gem we were seeking. It depicted a group of large figures with prominent horns placed next to a group of smaller, undetailed figures."
 flavour_yinquan.18.desc6: "Featuring prominently on furniture, the temple at Zyugok's associated symbol is a shape resembling a downwards-pointed sword. The temple's room layout, though reasonable enough on the surface, quickly became strange once one began to examine the rooms within. Every room was filled with furniture, usually placed erratically and with no regard to the efficiency of the design- That is what the scholars analyzing it said, at least. What was far more relevant to the expedition at large is that many of these pieces of furniture either concealed traps or were traps themselves. Whatever this temple holds, it is quite clear that it will not be uncovered easily..\n\nThere is much more to be found within this high temple, of that I am certain. However, the objective of the expedition - a glowing gem sharing the temple's sword symbol - has been found and cataloged. Of note is a wall carving found in the only empty room of the temple, sketch included, depicting a large building resembling a high temple surrounded by many smaller temples, linked by thin, well-carved lines. Combined with other, similar drawings, it paints an eerie picture."
 flavour_yinquan.18.desc7: "I could scarce believe our luck when we managed to set up a basecamp, provision adventurers, and then send an expedition down into the high temple's lower complex without any major complications or delays. Naturally, this luck did not sustain itself. In short order, we discovered that the charted map was significantly smaller than most other high temples (who, aside from Tianlou, were roughly the same size in terms of underground construction) and that the symbol associated with the complex could not be found inside of it.\n\nFurther searching revealed that, as expected, significant stretches of the complex were hidden inside secret walls and passages, the rooms revealed frequently lit by dim glowing symbols. These rooms contained the expected symbol: six curved lines converging on one another into a central point. The largest example of this was in a mural found near the temple gem, depicting countless shapes and objects in a landscape shot, leaving grooves in the ground that resembled trails.\n\nNone of these rooms held any passage beyond the familiar ward-sealed doors deep inside the complex. Even so, another gem has been extracted from the high temple for study."
 flavour_yinquan.18.desc8: "While preparing a base to manage the expedition from, we received generous help from the local warrior-monks. Too generous, in fact; their efforts to provide us hospitality and assistance ended up being excessive. We spent more time preparing the monks to accompany us (given their fighting skill, it did not feel prudent to refuse them) into the high temple than we did exploring it.\n\nAs expected of the inside of the temple, a symbol resembling two straight lines crossed in the middle featured prominently on many objects within the temple. There were many traps, which was also expected, but it appears that the specialty of the warrior-monks accompanying us made them well-suited for identifying traps - when they knew what to look for. The expertise of these monks did offer new perspectives, however - we discovered a relief of an incredibly intricately painted black sword, remarkable for its resemblance to Kongjian.\n\nOne of the monks found a gem marking the descriptor in a secret room uncovered by a poorly-concealed secret entrance. Due to improper handling, the gem was shattered by the time it reached our hands. Nonetheless, with this gem recovered, we have no other reason to be inside this temple."
 flavour_yinquan.18.desc9: "Featuring a symbol that looks like 5 lines intersecting a large dot at varying angles, the high temple at Shanyutian has proven to be the most dangerous for those of us charged with overseeing the expedition. For reasons unclear, the morale of the adventurers and scholars never seemed to improve beyond approaching a state of mutiny. You were never alerted to this, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], because it never worsened to an actual mutiny; we kept it carefully in check and still within budget.\n\nThe layout of the inner complex, in addition to the prevalence of traps within, do not appear to be exceptional in design. The most notable part of the temple is a hidden mural - a depiction of what are most definitely chains overtop of a river. This seems to be the central focus of the temple, located next to a cracked and flickering gem. We could not remove the gem without breaking it.

The other expeditions, whatever they have done, have destroyed the obstruction to the inner depths of the Tianlou temple! At your behest, I have had the sealing statue examined after every expedition; Each time, another one of the glowing gems upon the dragon had flickered out. It has also been mentioned to me that the ones still glowing grew fainter with each one disabled. When the last gem was disabled, the party discovered that the statue was crumbling into dust, the magic sealing the door nonexistent.\n\nOrdering that the entire expedition stay here, though expensive, has made preparing for this moment an order of magnitude easier. As this missive reaches you, groups of veteran adventurers will be exploring the exposed depths with cautious curiosity, a veritable army of scholars behind them to chart every last mural, every last turn, and every other quirk they find within.

Those murals found at the other temples, they have revealed a truth that, put in perspective with this temple at Tianlou, makes me sick to my stomach. These temples are not just decorations - within the depths of the high temple, we found a structure I could only describe as a heart. With every "beat" of this heart, it seemed to radiate waves of fatigue, piercing down into my very soul. Careful observation revealed to us lines of power arriving into this heart from the west and departing to the east, like the veins of some vast and unknown creature. Months of careful study and we have only learned basic things about this heart: whatever it is, it is anathema to all sorts of spirits! I do not know where they have been driven. I only know that what truly lies within these temples was not worthy of worship.\n\nFor all of this, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], you must be careful. I was not the first to receive this information, and as I write to you it is nearly certainly spreading like wildfire across the countryside. The High Philosophy scholars cannot be trusted; they will rally to the defense of their monstrous idols  They will not care about the inconvenient truth of their function - these scholars would see the truth of the high temples suppressed permanently.

As the rumors spread, however, it began to become a more and more credible idea; the eunuchs, as a group, became more standoffish. Their High Philosophy sympathies - namely, their steadfast desire to see the high temple of Tianlou preserved - became more and more obvious with each passing day, for it seemed to most of them that it was certain that the high temple would be scoured, and their quiet obedience turned to resentment, and that resentment turned to disrespect.\n\nTheir disrespect is a threat to Yinquan.

He was not explicitly ordered to stay in the temple, but through sheer force of will (and generous pay) he was able to keep a solid contingent of adventurers and guards alongside him. Tianlou's depths were not nearly as treacherous as its upper levels, yet the information within was every bit as dangerous as the traps above them. With every day, another fragment was sketched and shown to the camp. Every day, it was the same story: This temple was made to torture the spirits, to drain their life force; Liu had seen it for himself. Powered by a heart that pulsated with energy, the commander knew it was a few well-placed hammer blows from destruction.\n\nToday, he received the missive he had, in truth, been waiting for. "Destroy the temple," he read, and that was all he needed to see. Liu Yu gathered the most righteous of his men (which, by this point, was most of the remaining ones) and armed them with pickaxes and hammers. His work was short, intense, and messy; the "scholars" in camp were the first to go. After them, his army fell upon the "scholars" of the temple. Their intellectual background made them poor fighters, especially when caught so unawares.\n\nWhen the captain and his holy warriors descended into the High Temple's depths, they made no exceptions. The sound of hymns competed with the crack and crash of stone to be the loudest noise, a symphony which only drove the righteous army further on. Liu Yu found the heart quickly. Its pulse seemed to quicken in response to his arrival. Accompanied by the cheers of the crowd, the captain took it upon himself to finally kill the temple with one blow after another, until his arms screamed with pain and he could do little but pant.\n\n"Soldiers...!" he finally managed to hushed army, "For your deeds today, I think you all deserve a raise!""

From the unique vantage granted by the High Temple, however, a bird's eye view that no other structure could even hope to replicate, the true beauty of Tianlou is revealed. There, on top of the world, graced by the mind-clearing chill of the winds, there is a view stretching for miles and miles beyond.\n\nNothing is chaotic about Tianlou. From above, the careful planning of the city is revealed - every road is planted with purpose, the grid of streets like a spider web in the fine delicacy of its creation. Though the streets are filled with flowing banners and marching troops, from above they simply seem like yet another crowd. From above, there are no soldiers, no nations; there is only man and his works innumerable."

They were here to trade gold for luxuries, like usual. I mean, they were always hungry for iron, but the individual sailors had deep pockets and cared a whole lot more for a vase than a bar of metal. Plenty of them were perfectly happy to spend a week or two of downtime enjoying themselves around Beikdugang. With a once-in-a-decade event like this, I was happy to enjoy myself, too.\n\nWhen sufficiently drunk, some of those sailors were up for a lovely conversation - as long as I shared a drink with them. Good thing I love rice wine. One of the sailors, a man from a city named Vahjegiiv, was happy to tell me why he took to the sea.\n\n"No centaurs," he told me between drinks. Incredulous, I asked him how bad they really were. "Imagine a horse running at you. Now imagine it screaming and waving a spear around." Deciding to change the subject, I asked him what his favorite city on the coast was. "This one!" he said to me. "They love us here! It's the only city around these parts where I can hook up with someone like you."\n\nWhen drunk, those Triunics really know how to flirt."

This wasn’t because it was well-guarded - under normal circumstances, the garrison would be paltry - but much rather that careful mind had to be paid to collateral damage. As many in Yanshen are well aware, the island is the home of the smiths of the moshugong swords, well known for their power (and their scarcity). The magic and techniques required to forge one are closely-guarded secrets. If any of the smiths were to die, then it would set their technique back centuries.\n\nThis is, strangely enough, a significant obstacle. The average soldier is inclined to loot; after all, it is known as their second pay. In the process, things are destroyed and people die. When it concerns something with as much potential as the moshugong swords, this isn't something that can be allowed to come to pass. Soldiers had to be carefully selected, and a crack team formed in order to safely take Ginjyu. Even though most of the garrison had since been recalled in order to do battle on the field, there was enough resistance to make it a close-run affair.\n\nWith the island secured, and casualties low, its potential is immense. Imagine how powerful a soldier will be when his sword can cleave through anything! What couldn't he defeat? All that remains to be done is to convince the swordsmiths to help us, and to figure out how to make enough swords to stock an entire army..."

Nobody knows the specifics, but rumor has it their cities are as well put together as their armies. Even though the inside of their legendary warcamps has not been seen by most, if they looked like anything it would certainly be Bianfang. The entire city is riddled with fortifications, reinforced walls and windows like parapets indicating that every line of houses was built with another wall in mind.\n\nHere, warfare and domestic life blend as easily as dirt and grass. A smith peddling swords is as normal as a farmer with vegetables. Drills inside the city used to be common, too - in fact, the most common complaint leveled against their new rulers is that we provide no such spectacle! The orderly nature of the city is obvious, even after its conquest; the Dragon King trained his subjects too well. If the hobgoblins also bend over backwards to continue paying taxes, even to Yinquan, then there would be little difference between them and Bianfang indeed!"

Though the monks are no longer permitted to set the affairs of state, for that is no longer their jurisdiction, the Righteous Conclave is also where they determine many of the other aspects of how to operate their sects - such as tithes (for those who have them), the movement of initiates, and how to apportion territory in a manner that satisfies mostly everyone. Even though no guards were permitted to view the Conclave, we were provided a record of what was discussed.\n\nAll in all, though our ownership might cause some hiccups with the independently-minded Xianjie, most of the monks have taken to our administration well. They are permitted to do many of the things they were accustomed to before, and they are treated very well. The effect of this is that a rich relationship of mutual trust has developed between the state and the Xia; not entirely surprising, given our many ties."

With but a few movements of the hand, the Ghost Emperor could see the entire building. It less resembles a contraption and more the strings of a great puppet. Echoes travel far within the former royal palace; it was subtly remodeled to make noise travel better, allowing for Caoban to better hear what happened between his servants. Despite only being able to shift around on his throne, Song Caoban might as well have been able to walk around.\n\nSong Caoban is long gone, the Ghost Emperor having long since heeded the call of the realm he tried so hard to delay. The palace of Tuan Caoban is the physical representation of his legacy, a construction that none after him have tried to demolish.

For many, especially those in the Xia, it is a warning about the Command: It will conquer you, then impose itself onto you, and then annihilate you should you resist the destruction of your way of life. Enough word of the incident spread from refugees, mostly those that rebels were able to smuggle out of the Command. Recapturing this mood is difficult - Haless was too divided to properly respond to such talk of massacres, and so there was nothing to be done except await the Command's next moves with baited breath.\n\nAs soldiers march through Sir, tearing down the three-headed banner, driving the hobgoblins back into the darkness, it also commemorates the first time the damage to the city may truly be seen. For the most part, tales of the destruction of Sir had been accurate, though the hobgoblins had seen fit to reconstruct it. That which had been razed had been reconstructed, mostly; recreated in the brutally efficient style that the Command so well embodies. There were no cheering crowds, no fighting in the streets. Everyone was cowed. Pacified.\n\nSir never healed from its infamous razing. The open, gaping wounds created by the Command were not healed with its apparent reconstruction - they were simply sealed over; scars still dot the city. Now, with its inhabitants freed from evil, the city might finally truly recover."

After all, the hobgoblins did not take well to trespassers, especially not the kind that wanted to learn about the beating hearts of their empire. As with a heart, removing Sarilavhan from the Command was a long, bloody process. It is not the only hobgoblin warcamp, but it seems to have been the most important - many affairs of state seem to have been conducted there primarily.\n\nWhile initially built into a town, the "Great Warcamp", as our soldiers call it, grew into a vast hobgoblin citadel. The fieldworks are extensive, the rows of barracks occupied by a garrison as large as Sarilavhan itself. There was enough food and water stored within to outlast a years-long siege. Once it was finally captured, we learned that the hobgoblins were better provisioned than our soldiers! What the Command knew best was scale; even their command centers seemed larger than life. When the citadel was finally brought down, it was only because the hobgoblins within learned that their leaders had evacuated before the siege started - their morale broke long before the walls ever could.\n\nWith such a fortress in our hands, the possibilities are endless. It only makes it more unfortunate that it is being dismantled. The Command might have needed such a citadel to house their functions of state, but we have no such need for it. As such, it is a waste of resources to maintain such a large construction. A majority of the fortifications will be dismantled and sold, and then the rest will be staffed by a much smaller garrison."

Now that our soldiers march through its streets, many of these jokes take on a new meaning: Dhenijansar is a city of sin.\n\nStaffed by legions innumerable of High Philosophy literati, the rot within Dhenijansar is intense, a smothering presence felt all throughout the city. Eunuchs, the sort that we exterminated in Yanshen already, populate Dhenijansar in droves, working to litigate and stifle everything they can find. The city is a center for the High Philosophy, with many debates being raised and settled in its quarters. It is a monument to darkness; to the vision the eunuchs would impose over the rest of Haless if given the chance.\n\nBut that will never get the chance to happen again. The ministries will be razed, and their eunuchs hanged. With fire and faith, even the distant Raj will be liberated of its High Philosophy oppressors. Under Lingyuk, it will be given the chance it never had to flourish as a center of piety and commerce. Ripping the rot out will hurt it, certainly, but the new life will revitalize it in time."

It will never escape that role, nor should it try. Actually capturing the city was difficult; the myriad ports allowed for them to resupply quite easily. Even after these were rendered inoperable, the efforts of passing merchants to buoy up their trading station made it much harder to attack Arawkelin than it otherwise should have been. Bribery is what finally allowed the city to fall - soldiers paid richly to open the gates and keep them open until we could enter Arawkelin, after which the garrison promptly surrendered.\n\nThe city was made for the purposes of constructing and maintaining military ships, and it is easy to see how it could fulfill that purpose. An entire quarter belonged to various shipwrights and their laborers, and the drydocks within are well ahead of their time. It seems that the land around the city had even been reshaped in the past, the shoreline and the land below it modified to better suit the expansion of harbors. Many of these docks are set aside for the purposes of trade, and the volume of cargo which the city's harbor is capable of moving is intense; perhaps the single greatest harbor complex in Haless.\n\nAs for what we shall do with it... nothing! Once they have been brought to respect the spirits, then Arawkelin will continue its role as a trade and naval center.

As one might imagine, these fortresses are difficult to breach - it only makes the looting that follows that much more violent, as now the men are not only avenging ancient wrongs but much newer, personal grievances. It's very destructive.\n\nRumors have it that each group of oni is largely different from the rest, and each desires different things. The oni from Kabiurgarko are known to be concerned with the acquisition of money above all else, hoarding it in vast vaults. In fact, they are known to be the only group of oni which will accept gold in place of a human when they demand as much as tribute. These grand stories of greed were proven true after Kabiurgarko (the Shirgrii) fell to our army's attack. As the men engaged in their customary campaign of wrecking the fortress, they discovered something very particular: hidden gold!\n\nThe next few days came to be known as the Great Emptying, as the soldiers broke and destroyed just about anything they could find, looking for stashes of hidden oni gold. While most of the Shirgrii were in poor condition after being captured, Kabiurgarko took the worst of it all, with nearly anything of note within destroyed. However, many riches were indeed found and "relocated" by the men - so well that even we couldn't tax them!"

It should be no surprise that they have tried as hard as they have to keep - and then later regain - control of the city. Actually conquering Yanzhong was a routine affair, as much as attacking a fortified city can be. The war was won not long after. The war in the shadows, however, has been much more contested.\n\nMany spies have been found in the city, though less of them have been truly disposed of. A severed head is all we received from the first magister to try and administrate the city. Yanzhong is still full of spies, for the Yanzhin League has been eager to utilize their well-trained skills in espionage to regain their sister city. Rebellion was narrowly averted once already. It is as if every resource the League has has been dedicated towards removing our forces from Yanzhong.\n\nDenying their efficacy would be foolish. More damage has been done to our administration than a war ever could have inflicted. Even so, this state of affairs is one that will not - cannot - last forever. The Yanzhin League's resources are finite; slowly, surely, they will run out of feelers within the city they covet. When that day comes, they will have lost the city forever. Of course, it will not hurt that effort when they are conquered, as well. Stripped of any state to take resources from, the myriad spies and assassins will wither away to nothing."

The city had little-to-no military; barely even a garrison to oppose a siege, toppled quickly by a timely assault. Taking the garrison prisoner was almost disheartening; they were largely unequipped for what we had to bear against them. Surely this was not all Sarisung could mobilize? It wasn't, though not in the way we expected.\n\nSarisung is a city with an extensive gang presence. Much of the city is - was - divided into what were effectively fiefdoms between various criminal families, who seem to have access to most of Sarisung's resources. Their personal militaries were more prepared for a fight than the actual government's. Occupying the city was a bloody affair, with the gangs using their knowledge of the urban surroundings to ambush and attack our forces, apparently to convince them that the city was not worth the effort of conquering. Not even a set of cannons hidden in a two-story workshop could stop our men, though. Slowly, yet surely, the criminal families of Sarisung will be burnt out, battered until they are bloody and their leaders brought out to hang.\n\nThe city is already rich, but once it is pacified it has an easy path to becoming even richer. Without having to buy into protection rackets and other illegitimate "fees", traders can more safely travel the city, and see Sarisung as less of an expense and more of an opportunity. Artisans within will benefit the same way, being able to work under our protection without intimidation. One day, there will be nothing here but prosperity, and this exploitation will be nothing but a bloody memory."

They are built to last; the defenses are often immaculate, and Verkal Ozovar is built into the mountain range in such a way that there are no caves to exploit for an entrance. The weakness of the hold was food. Dependent on the farms outside the mountain for food, their stockpiles were vast but eventually depleted. Faced with the threat of starvation or surrender, the Nephrite dwarves wisely chose to surrender control of the hold to our armies. Likewise, it will be occupied until such time that we have determined the terms of our surrender.\n\nWhile cataloging their archives, a revelation came to our scholars: there was no single map of the hold. Incomplete copies existed, sometimes erroneous and always smaller than what was truly there - dead ends became causeways, tunnels became housing blocks, and most of the knowledge about how to navigate it seemed to have been oral tradition passed down from one dwarf to another. Initially, this did not really matter, as the matter was less pressing than making sure they would pay their new taxes. Of course, it began to matter after some of the garrison got lost.\n\nAfter a three-day manhunt (where the missing people were not found), the terms of surrender became much harsher. Evidently, the dwarves could not be trusted to manage their own hold! Among other things, they will now be obligated to produce a current and accurate map of Verkal Ozovar once at least every 5 years. It is a pity it took death to reach this point, but at least it will not happen again."

 flavour_yinquan.40.desc2:0 "In a move unexpected for the leaders of our state, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has neither died nor been voted out - they have stepped down in the middle of their term! Leaving behind a well-organized list of affairs, they have made sure that Yinquan's affairs are as they need to be - or easily settled - in order for the country to find a replacement quickly and efficiently."
 flavour_yinquan.40.desc3:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been found deceased in their own home! By anyone's reckoning, they appear to have been sitting outside when their chair's legs broke, leading them to take a misfortunate fall directly onto the corner of a stair. Thankfully, with most of their affairs resolved, it is a very simple affair to simply prepare their successor for the role - this time with sturdier furniture!" 
 flavour_yinquan.40.desc4:0 "A piercing scream emanated from the presidential palace late this evening. When the guards rushed to the scene, they found [Root.Monarch.GetName] dead. Nothing indicates any kind of assassination, as their body was found entirely unharmed. It seems that something, somewhere, caused their heart to simply stop beating. Magical assassination is unlikely, as well. Luckily, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had turned their attention to the matters of a successor shortly before the time of their death. They leave behind no unfinished business."
 flavour_yinquan.40.desc5:0 "While walking down a set of stars while carrying a few pages of paperwork, it turns out that [Root.Monarch.GetName] was paying more attention to the papers than their feet. The guards were forced to witness the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] fall down the stairs, hitting every step on the way down before finally hitting the ground with a deafening thud. Their bodyguards were too stunned by the scene to act, at first. They report seeing the body in a recumbent position with one hand laying palm down near the head, and the other hand twisted behind their back, while one leg pointed towards the ground and another pointed away from the body. However, as grisly as this scene was, the paperwork in [Root.Monarch.Getherhis] hands was the final piece required to secure the appointment of a successor. So, by some miracle, the line of succession can proceed without trouble!"
 flavour_yinquan.40.desc6:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is simply gone. There are no signs to mark their sudden absence; no evidence of struggling in their home, no notes for ransom, not even a scream on the night of their disappearance. We are unable to find them, though we will keep searching. But the state cannot function without a leader. A successor will be named from their expected successors, post-haste!"
 flavour_yinquan.40.desc7:0 "As a result of run-of-the-mill political maneuvering seemingly going wrong, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has made a number of very powerful enemies, including Liho's Maidens, the high ministers of the government, and a wandering merchant. They have come together to remove the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] from office effective immediately. After a few hours of behind-closed-doors discussion, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has agreed to the transition and a successor has already been prepared. Despite the inherent skullduggery of such a coup, it seems to have occurred without any actual issue - the state will continue on without any problems."

 flavour_yinquan.41.desc1:0 "The Shuvüüshudi have picked up an impressive reputation for being nothing but a bunch of fearsome raiders, that the great birds they ride upon are as built for killing as they are; given their reclusive nature, it has been very hard to figure out if that's actually the truth. After all, you can't judge someone by the point of their spear! Posing as a lonesome traveler at risk of being waylaid, my charm and guile allowed me to persuade one of the riders to take me back to his tribe for a little while. What I really wanted was a ride on one of those terror birds, just to see what it was like.\n\nThere's nothing like it in Yanshen! I'm not a stranger to shows of strength, especially not ones meant to impress me, but the birdmanship (ha ha) on display really floored me. The comfort he had upon his terror bird! It felt like the two of them were a centaur, those horse-people from further west. But more than that, I wanted to know what it was like to ride one around. Holding onto someone's back, it felt a lot like a horse. What was it like by myself? Once the tribesman was finished showboating, I let myself shine through. It didn't take very much to get him to acquiesce.\n\nWhen riding by yourself, it was a bit different from a horse, but also the same. On two legs, instead of four, leaning forwards and back had a much bigger effect on the bird. The saddle was also a little bit further back than I would have liked, so that my legs didn't get in the way of its wings. It felt really precarious, but the bird never seemed to have any problems with carrying me. I just had to make sure I didn't fall off in the process. Keeping a good grip on the reins kept me from falling off at all - it was like the terror bird was jostling me back into position whenever I slipped.\n\nAs thanks, I left the man a gift and then a few days ago slipped into the wilds, making sure not to be spotted on the way out. Some day, when the world gets a little less violent, I think that I might try to get my hands on a terror bird of my own."
 flavour_yinquan.41.desc2:0 "Diary, I want to apologize to you. I did not actually measure every road in Yanshen, and even if I did, their descriptions would leave no room in this book for anything else. Indeed, the only two that I measured were the roads from Yinquan to Kohai and then followed it however best I could to the city of Feiten. As you might have guessed by now, the objective was not to measure these roads, but instead to explore the things I could find while traveling along them. Just to sate your curiosity I will tell you this: The road from Yinquan to Kohai is paved, well maintained, and even. I do not believe any segments of the road flooded over the course of my travel. My journey to Feiten was much harder, as the road was rougher and less regular; It was like a dirt trail, though large and well-worn from use. The dirt got muddy plenty of times, and I saw some big puddles form, even if the road was not ever fully submerged.\n\nThere were plenty of places along the way, but most of them weren't very novel - so I don't have a lot to say about them. However, I did meet someone very interesting. He never told me his name, but I'll remember his look for a long time - a bright red robe, stained brown at its bottom, and a horse he seemed very fond of. It seemed almost like he was doing the exact same thing I was! As we passed, the question left my mouth before it could be stopped: Had he found anything interesting yet? He looked at me and shook his head. Then, he said,\n\n"Everything is interesting when you look closely enough." from there, the man paid me no mind, walking on to wherever he had his eye on. I didn't follow him, but I thought about what he said. Do you think I could have missed something memorable because I was too fixated on finding anything interesting? As I write this, my plan is to double back around and look a little bit closer than I had before. If anything occurs, you'll be the first to know."
 flavour_yinquan.41.desc3:0 "It's always so nice to be in Yinquan. The people around here love spirits, especially the Huli-Jing! Nobody around me knows what I really am, but that's fine - seeing their reverence is enough for me, even if I can't let them direct it towards me. Many of my sisters live with the humans there, too. It's more fun than I'd like to admit, trying to pick them out of a crowd. Today, none of them seemed to be around. Oh well. I carefully selected today to visit Yinquan, because I knew that there would be a festival in town - they had to go through the office of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for approval to be here, which meant I knew about their coming well in advance. So I "retired" from office (because I didn't want to be there as a head of state) and went as a common lady.\n\nAll of the shrines in Yinquan mean that there are plenty of shrine maidens to steward them, and when they organize it can lead to events like this, where the Kagura is performed for the crowd. This spirit will enjoy the dance just as much as the mortals around her! I haven't gotten a good chance to watch one of these dances in a good while. It's just about to start now, and so I'll write to you how I felt watching it.\n\nThe celebrations lasted all day. They were really nice, too. I should tell you how the dance went, first: in a word, great! It takes a lot of practice to do this dance. Switching between low and high energy movements with nothing but skill and some music to guide them. After the dance, I decided to risk my cover to congratulate the maiden who did the dancing. It was a bit hard to find her again, but when I did, I congratulated the young lady on her performance, giving her a small swish of my tail to make sure she knew who was talking to her. Watching the maiden's face light up made my evening. The alcohol afterwards helped as well.\n\nWhile both tipsy and tired, it's hard to write that much down here. I'll bid you a good night. If you ever grow legs, diary, you ought to try the mijiu. It's wonderful."
 flavour_yinquan.41.desc4:0 "Sometimes it's hard to justify why my disguises (or lack thereof) seem to work as well and as consistently as they do. People only see who they want to see, as demonstrated to me every day, but it's a wonder that they never recognize me. If I so desired, it would be relatively easy to change my appearance, but seeing as how the way I look now is perfect, it's best if that didn't have to happen. If someone were particularly observant, they would remember my amulet. Not many do.\n\nMy physical form is incredible. I don't just mean in the appearance sense - being able to hide my tail and my ears means that not even the other Huli-Jing could recognize my form unless they already knew me. Most of my sisters prefer to take the form of foxes, something which has made everyone in Yinquan more than happy to spoil any foxes they find. There's something of a game we play, where a Huli-Jing tries to flush out her sisters. It's not for any particular reason, just for a good laugh. When a fox sauntered up to me today for a treat, I gave it one. Once it was chewing on the scraps I gave it, I said hello to my sister.\n\nThey'll never respond the first time around, so I had to lay it on a bit thicker. I took my amulet off and turned around, brushing the fox's face with my tail. As suspected, they choked with surprise, morphing back into their humanoid form so that they could choke on their food scraps better. I patted their head and asked if they were alright. They nodded, still coughing. With that done, I slipped the amulet back around my neck, then stayed for an extra minute to make sure their food went down. After that, I waved them off again as they turned back into a fox and sauntered off.\n\nDiary, I bet you they'll remember how I look for sure."
 flavour_yinquan.41.desc5:0 "It's really fun to wander around while looking for regional delicacies. The number of things you can do with rice! I have to limit most of my searching to the cities, sadly. Many of the villages in the countryside don't have a lot they can do with money, so paying people to cook me food is not something I can do everywhere. What even less people will do is teach me, even though learning about how to cook their food is something I love doing. I was able to find someone to teach me how to make some regional food in Tianlou, at no small cost to myself. Much of the trip was dedicated to learning about how they cook food in the city.\n\nDid you know that food in Tianlou is very savory? The term the instructor taught me was "xianwei"; most of the dishes I learned about were very meaty, but a little sweet too. There's lots of seafood used as well as duck. I think my favorite dish of them all was the lion's head meatballs. To make them, I mixed minced pork and chicken together, in addition to scallions and ginger soaked in water beforehand. Later, I had to mix some of that water into the meatballs to help their texture. By mixing in the water just right, their texture becomes a little bit jiggly, though they stay in a ball very easily.\n\nAfter the meatballs have been prepared, they are browned by boiling them in oil. When they're nice and even, I then transferred them to a broth to simmer alongside mushroom and cabbage - this keeps them tender! Once they're entirely cooked, they are then paired with vegetables to complete the dish, in addition to steamed rice. If there was some way to record the smell into this diary, I would do it in a heartbeat.\n\nThe man teaching me was very patient as I learned about cooking this kind of food. When I asked him about it, the man said that he had cooked for a couple of major eunuchs in the city during his life, and that he found doing it to be a delight. I asked him why he was fine with teaching me. In response, he gave me a wry smile. None of his recipes were secret - it's just that he makes them very well! Besides, with how much I was willing to pay, teaching me how to cook this kind of food was an easy deal. I really hope I can find an arrangement like this elsewhere, too!"
 flavour_yinquan.41.desc6:0 "Holi requested that this one not be directly transcribed from her diary. In future, the distinction between the two should be obvious.\n\nThe first time Holi arrived in the city of Xiadao, it did not take her long to find a peculiar brand of mischief: a sect masquerading as a group of would-be investigators! At first, the four monks wanted little to do with her. She wasn't a paying customer, they said, so they needed to focus on more important affairs. Naturally, Holi settled this efficiently - she'd pay if they let her accompany them for a day. They were much more amenable to this deal. So she followed the sect - three harimari and an inexplicably lazy elf.\n\nUnfortunately, what Holi did not anticipate was that the day would be very boring. Presumably to impress her, the four did a lap around Xiadao. It resembled a sight-seeing tour more than anything to her. Even so, they were pleased to make conversation. As Holi learned, these four did any sort of job they were paid for. That doesn't sound very much like an investigator, does it? Holi didn't think so either. Upon confronting them, the elf nodded sagely. He informed her that investigation is city guard business, so they stay away from it. Though exasperated, Holi found herself captivated by this band of misfits. Enough so to even "accompany" them for a few more days - all on her dime.\n\nBy the third day, they had almost accepted her as a member of the sect. At the very least, they stopped trying to show her around Xiadao. On the fourth, she had the opportunity to join them for the escort of a pair of Swallow hobgoblins through the city on their way to Lot Dekkhang. With the help of their escort, they had no trouble. It was during this trip that Holi took the time to get to know the two. They were a pair of men by the names of Ren and Tojiko. Since they had no desire to have children or fight in a war, they were fleeing somewhere other than the Command.\n\nHoli informed them that she'd be sure to visit if she were in Lot Dekkhang, something the two laughed off. After this incident, she spent another day of inactivity before finally calling an end to the escapade. As Holi wandered past a craftsman making his way into the city, she already had her next destination in mind."
 flavour_yinquan.41.desc7:0 "For her next trip, Holi wished to reconnect with one of her friends: a Jade Dwarf named Ilbord, who lived in Verkal Ozovar. They had first met some twenty years before, and Holi wanted to visit. So she did.\n\nShe knew he worked as an artisan within the hold, so Holi thought first to try to find him within the surface marketplace, a district set aside for aboveground traders to buy and sell, as it was likely Ilbord had not changed his profession since.the last time she met him. Holi was correct; she found him selling hand-carved stone "trinkets" (there were too many to say it was any one kind). The two recognized each other very quickly, for 20 years had not aged either of them particularly harshly. Naturally, after a bit of talking, she offered that they have a proper discussion through a shared pastime: alcohol.\n\nA few hours later, after he had closed shop for the day, the two of them went drinking. It is hard to say if Ilbord had any idea of Holi's secret, but he had to have some idea something was up; Holi was just as heavy a drinker as he. Given that the dwarves of Verkal Ozovar do not water down the drinks in their hold even for outsiders, this is no small feat. One mug of ale turned to two, then four, and then before either of them knew it they were trying to out-drink the other, cheered on by dwarves and humans alike as they tested where the other would give up. As it turned out, it took a very long time.\n\nFinally, as Holi's hands shook and her voice quivered, Ilbord finally admitted defeat. As reward for her success, he would pay for both his and Holi's drinks. The things that he discussed with Holi after that were hard to make out, and very little of it was coherent. But it certainly made for an interesting evening, because she was in just the same shape! Of course, Holi did learn a very important lesson that day:\n\nNot even spirits can avoid a dwarven hangover."
 flavour_yinquan.41.desc8:0 "Though it is hard to consider the Lupulan Rainforest as anything other than extremely dangerous, Holi's form offered her some advantages that the average traveler would not have. Few things in the Lupulan will attack a spirit; even the tribes that dwell there, though hostile to outsiders, revere spirits deeply enough to give a Huli-Jing a wide berth. Thanks to the particularities of the Lupulan Rainforest, Holi did not have to wear her amulet. That way, she could also ensure her own safety.\n\nOf course, even for a spirit, it is important to be prepared carefully when visiting a rainforest. Shortly before entering the rainforest, Holi made sure to pack plenty of food and drink (though not necessary, it is certainly appreciated) for the journey, in addition to supplies such as camping supplies. As an offering to the jungle itself, she even arranged for a wineskin of Mijiu.\n\nThe trek itself was uneventful, as expected - nothing approached her. Though some of the Lupulan tribes monitored her for a time, once they realized Holi's nature as a Huli-Jing they were quick to give her a wide berth. When she had pierced satisfactorily deep into the rainforest, Holi gave the jungle her prepared offering and beseeched it for a boon: the privilege to sail a rowboat through the Lupulan river. Appreciative of the thought put into the offering (if not necessarily the Mijiu itself), the rainforest itself granted her request. With this in mind, Holi continued her sightseeing trip south, towards the port city of Arawkelin. All things included, this was probably one of her longest trips around Haless."
 flavour_yinquan.41.desc9:0 "Once she had made her way entirely through the Lupulan, Holi's next location was Arawkelin, where she would take a boat to the city of Lot Dekkhang. An individual such as herself was incredibly unusual, for few other than warriors travel out of the Lupulan, and certainly never alone; Were it not for her womanly charm, she would have faced much harsher scrutiny than a routine customs check. After being evaluated as no threat (and lacking the supplies for espionage), she was let through. From there it was just a simple walk to Arawkelin.\n\nHoli planned to do some sightseeing in the city before she left for elsewhere. This did not go entirely as planned. Though a tremendously productive city, Arawkelin had relatively little in terms of landmarks aside from its ports. It did have plenty of inns, pubs, and bars, and so Holi opted to make do with another night of hearing gossip. Were it not so far west, she discovered, she would have been happy to record her experiences with the Jadd. The news of piracy made her hesitate: What would she do if her ship was commandeered by pirates? Holi eventually settled on jumping overboard.\n\nAfter nearly being robbed (and learning an important lesson about shortcuts) she purchased a fresh load of supplies, acquired safe passage, and set sail for Lot Dekkhang, where she hoped to finish her trip by trying to find Ren and Tojiko, if indeed they had made it there safely. Here, Holi learned her second lesson of the trip."
 flavour_yinquan.41.desc10:0 "Holi was worried that her trip to Lot Dekkhang would be met with trouble. After all, she had paid for passage on a merchant ship, a prime target for piracy. This was not the case. Instead, she had a livable trip where, when she was not seasick, she was treated as an oddity by the crew - especially after drinking just as much as they did! When she finally made port in Lot Dekkhang, she left behind a ship of sailors who would nearly certainly remember her.\n\nNow, Holi simply needed to find who she was looking for - Ren and Tojiko. Though she remembered their faces, there were a lot of hobgoblins in the city; given their propensity to group together, this meant she had her work cut out for her. Many of the Swallow Hobgoblins worked as mercenaries, and much of the commerce in their district consisted of businesses that aided that fact. Not knowing where else to start, Holi decided to ask around. It took a few hours, but she eventually found her target: the pair had established themselves as a pair of blacksmiths, creating weapons and armor to sell to Swallow Hobgoblin mercenaries.\n\nThey shared a shocked moment of silence as they met Holi once again, only to laugh it off once more. The three of them had a long and lively conversation about their exploits since they had met last. As Holi slowly learned, the two's shop had fallen on hard times, for, as far as either of them could tell, a spirit had infested their store room. It was hard to get anything done, and it was scaring customers away. She had heard it walking in, but did not know what the noise was. A little bit of persuasion later, and they agreed to let her try her luck with their spirit.\n\nWhen Holi confronted the wailing being, she managed to get out of it that it had agreed to be put into a charm as part of settling a debt, only to be placed here as a means of sabotage (though it would not say by who). The medallion agreed to stop if it was taken away from Lot Dekkhang.\n\nAs a token of their thanks, Ren and Tojiko presented Holi with a ceremonial sword - the previous buyer had reneged on their deal, so they thought it wouldn't hurt to give it to her."
