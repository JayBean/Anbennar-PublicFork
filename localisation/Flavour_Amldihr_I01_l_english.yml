[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] practiced rhetoric breaks, however, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] moves on to the topic of Aul-Dwarov. In candid honesty the success of Amldihr is laid out. West Dwarovar is under Amldihr influence, the Lords of the Assembly answer to Amldihr's [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], relative peace has become the norm after centuries of orcish incursion. Is this all we can achieve? 'No', [Root.Monarch.GetName] states without a hint of doubt. A sense of what was is returning under our efforts, and what was, is Aul-Dwarov."

Bearing a crown with the weight of an empire, [Root.Monarch.GetName] walks to the end of the table, pierced by the eyes of hundreds of Lords. Taking a seat upon a towering throne, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes respond in kind with a glare of dominance at all in the Assembly. Goblet in hand, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] raises it high. A silence follows for only a second, but it is a second felt throughout Serpentspine, present and past. The second passing, the Assembly erupts in cheers of joy. From Amldihr to the rest of Serpentspine, dwarves cheer away an end of a dark chapter in Dwarven history. [Root.Monarch.GetName] lowers [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] goblet, though the cheers do not end, nor would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] expect them to. Aul-Dwarov has returned, and with it, A High King."
