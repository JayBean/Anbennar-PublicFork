We see in the response to the expansionism of High Havoral several diplomatic innovations: multinational product-targeted embargo, humanitarian corridors, legally authorised and codified overseas asset confiscation, and targeted proscription - that is, leaders specifically barred from international travel, rather than simply their citizenry.\n\nIn High Havoral’s answer to these measures, we see perhaps the chief advantage of the rogue state - its ability to take unilateral action, unshackled by diplomatic niceties, in any and all regions where it can project force. For the several Boek settlements destroyed during the initial construction stages of the Arbeloch Ascensor, the knowledge that they were living through the cutting edge of international diplomacy would have come, one assumes, as somewhat faint comfort."\n\nArtem Yivyetchk, Opening Address to the Faculty of Political Sciences, 1938."

Thus these riders of the drylands proved themselves a tougher weed than most to uproot, and at court we convened many conferences to discuss the problem.\n\nIt is the purpose of histories such as this to record honest feeling, and I confess we raged in our cosseted halls, sipping from Sardish cups looted from our captive territories while reviling the frontiersmen for their banditry.

We lived in a vast, anarchic city of tents, whose proportions and shape changed daily as corps arrived or left on expeditions. Not all raids - by that time there were far too many to live only on plunder - but many raids. And as they returned, a feast or a party would consume one arm of the maelstrom, so that were you nearby you would be inevitably drawn in, to serve or to dance or to drown.\n\nCela saw the limits of this, I think, and realised our only defence was our remoteness, and our concentration of strength.

I was invisible, so invisible that it took decades for anyone to see me at all, or to realise what I was; a living history of the Greyfort.\n\nWe had stamped the Painted People into the dirt. None of the fellow Cannorians who had come to Veykoda still hoisted their own flag. The endlessly self-replenishing wealth of the herd was ours, flowing through a mercenary camp that even I was forced to admit was becoming a proper city. Any man lieutenant or up was living a life of quaint colonial luxury, cavorting with a veritable torrent of cheap flesh - rarely collared, but so poor from constant raiding that the bordello life in Greyguard was the single remaining option. It was as if the whole city was an army just returned from a successful campaign, and such armies show precious little grace in victory.\n\nPerhaps it was this which made the bandit lords so complacent, which made them discount the rumbling discontent of a cruel people left without targets, a dispositionally scrappy folk slowly forced into lassitude. The Greyfort no longer possessed the cold deliberation of the crazed drunk - now he was the drunk who’d thrown a punch, and felt pretty smug about how the other fellow had gone down in one, thank you very much. He didn’t yet see the likely lads coming up behind him.\n\nYou’ll forgive me the self-congratulation, I hope, but by the time I had my offer, I could feel where the tide was shifting.

The man would take up a croft, a ways out the village, usually up in the foothills. There was always land free, it was just shit; scrabbly and only good for goats. The man would work at that land, hack and wear at it like it was whatever demon who’d chased him here, until he’d gathered the makings of a real herd and put up a few pear trees. Until he was finally calmed enough to sit at a tavern; until he’d gotten back his home training.\n\nPeople will tell you we were cowards, not made for the frontier life, and perhaps they’re right, but this was a place where a person could flee. We starved when the rain failed and froze to death in winter and learned which stands of wood we couldn’t cut if we wanted to live out a flood, but we did it in anonymous togetherness, the dregs of an old world that never wanted us, the washouts of a new world that demanded evil of us. We even had some Veekies after a while, good lads with an axe who did work in the berry-copses. We fell in love with all kinds of murderers, and our gaunt hills offered them atonement. I think there is honour in that.’’\n\n- Hylat, Crofter"

I encourage you to think of the region in those days as a series of small markets, connected by river and otherwise isolated but for faint earth tracks scratched in the ground, which would feather outward to small shepherd’s crofts or farming homesteads. Nearby Greyguard - though we called it Vathres, which was the style at the time - could connect to this long riverine byway via the Galynnast, and thus benefit from the scant bounty we drew from the river’s flanks. In those days we thought of ourselves as a sort of new Esmar - jokingly of course, since we were living on salt lamb and nettle tea - but perhaps we saw something of the future in making the claim, because in my old age I confess to find the Galynn a true rival in beauty and culture to any river in Cannor.

We were at all times inundated with pamphlets and periodicals, blistering polemics against the despotism beyond the waterfalls, the evil of the warlord kings. Some radical groups, the pan-elven ones who came about as a reaction against the Aelnari ugliness, even saw things through the lens of the pogrom. We thought all things, magic and reason and progress, should belong to as many as possible.\n\nFar from my fantasies of taking up arms or passionately enlightening urchins, men like me were chosen for our clerical skills. We were literate, used to administering estates, and had a mind for the parsimonious and the detailed. We came to a country devoid of real institutions, a setting not out of place in some dreadful romantic novel, a graveyard of civilisation.

Few countries in the world had so many Ravelian lodges as High Havoral by the tenth year of the new faith - it was like a mould that grows below tile, unseen and everywhere.\n\nThis was a country of disparate peoples - refugees, the enslaved and the conquered all lived on top of each other. Fifteen years before this author’s birth, the philosopher Mirjandi crossed south into the Trollsbay and, looking over her shoulder in sorrow, called the Ynn the wasteland of hope. She would later argue that we took to Ravelianism in search of that hope - and perhaps in the main this is true. But Ravelianism also promised the promulgation of magic, a route to power for the common man in a country where only numbers and brute strength had ever counted. The New Havorics could perhaps have warned a few people a century later about what such a promise can do for the enemies of despotism."\n\nLahina Kavac, Faiths of the Ynn"

In the pandemonium, it is impossible to gain any sense of the battle’s leaning.\n\nWith nervous steps, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] starts to move towards one of the many hidden exits of this room, their heart pounding in their ears as they fumble with the mechanism, swearing silently as it clicks, and slowly starts to open.

This led to an informal vote of a slim majority of the Band’s corps in favour of moving en-masse across the sea, where they were promptly moved on under threat of violence by the powers of the Trollsbay. They were let loose into the Ynn basin in the hopes they would create a general nuisance and complicate the northern front.

    flavor_newhavoral.20.d:0 "Terrible news arrived this morning from the east: a bold Veykodan raid broke through the front of our hunting range and burned much of a major homesteader market village. The homesteaders have announced their intent to leave, since they cannot hope to survive the next winter with most of their supplies and housing burned. The Greyfort has the opportunity to intervene here and preserve what was a relatively prosperous centre of commerce."
    flavor_newhavoral.20.a:0 "Stop them! They will have our aid."
    flavor_newhavoral.20.b:0 "We cannot spare the men."

    flavor_newhavoral.21.d:0 ""There were always rumors. Like goddamned old ladies we were, gossiping. Guess it’s ‘cause reputation was so important. But I remember straight off, the Nameless Host was different. It was like they were everywhere. You’d hear about them raiding the river ports, down in the heartlands, out along the border, all in the same week. One report said they looked like foreign mercs, another swore they were paintheads with nothing more than farm tools. They wanted loot, they wanted to rule, they wanted freedom— you get the idea. We knew nothing. All we could guess was that they were recruiting the lowdowns, on account of how they sent threats to most everyone who mattered. Carved on the walls in the night and such. But never the King, which was strangest of all.\n\nWe learned not to hang around while [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was hearing about the Host. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] got jumpy— worrying about some thug bursting in and cutting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] down, I guess. It got to be pretty tense. You dropped a plate and you were a Nameless spy, off to the dungeons with you. The breaking wheel was pretty busy in those days.\n\nThe only guys safe were the Royal Guard, I guess ‘cause they were the ones taking others away. I remember one guy with a trident who was real good at calming the King down. Practically the only one who dared talk to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was in a mood. "We stand ready to protect you," blah blah blah, and somehow it worked. Never knew his name. Hope he’s doin’ alright. Me, I’m just lucky I saw which way the wind was gonna blow. Even if it cost me."\n\n- "Shred-Leg" Roger, Asraport beggar, former Havoric Royal Quartermaster"
