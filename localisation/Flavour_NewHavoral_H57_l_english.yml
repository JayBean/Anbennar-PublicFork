    flavor_newhavoral.1.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. Bandit factions try to come together to form a government but are unable to compromise. This goes on for a few days before Kerstin of Greyguard storms the meeting room with her personal soldiers, couping the government for herself."
    flavor_newhavoral.2.t:0 "Poachers Attacked!"
    flavor_newhavoral.2.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. After the start of Havoric poaching in Veykoda, Veykodans react aggressively by organizing hunting parties against our poachers. This is the start of the Ivory Wars."
    flavor_newhavoral.3.t:0 "Usurper"
    flavor_newhavoral.3.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. you just got couped son."
    flavor_newhavoral.4.t:0 "Age of the Mountain"
    flavor_newhavoral.4.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. With the conquest of Sarda completed, the removal of fickle bandits as a political group to appease, and a support base growing in newly acquired Ynnic subjects, the Kingdom of High Havoral is proclaimed, claiming sovereignty over Sarda."
    flavor_newhavoral.5.t:0 "Ynnic Loyalists"
    flavor_newhavoral.5.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. Bandit Captains have often been a required group to appease for any leader of New Havoral, but with the recent conquests in Sarda, the powerbase can be shifted westward with loyal Ynnic subjects. Bandit Captains are ousted from any political control, relegated to backwater positions."
    flavor_newhavoral.6.t:0 "A Conversion Most Convincing"
    flavor_newhavoral.6.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. Through a mixture of harsh and 'thorough' convincing, much of Sarda has been converted to Ravelianism. To gain more legitimacy for High Havoral, recognition for Ynnic Rectors is asked for, with guided tours of Sarda to convince Ravelian representatives against the more cruel reality of Havoric occupation of the Ynn."
    flavor_newhavoral.7.t:0 "Golden Dome"
    flavor_newhavoral.7.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. The Golden Dome is of cultural importance to the Sarda, with the Knights of the Dome tasked with defending it.

    flavor_newhavoral.8.t:0 "Plea Deal"
    flavor_newhavoral.8.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. With recent conquests, much of Sarda has been devastated. To facilitate repairs, and to lighten the impact on High Havoral's coffers, the Balgabar Dwarves are given the chance for autonomy in exchange for repairing and improving Havoric lands."
    flavor_newhavoral.9.t:0 "Mountain's Shadow"
    flavor_newhavoral.9.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. Ynn is indisputably in High Havoral's hands. With the proclamation of the Empire of High Havoral, all hopes in the Ynn are snuffed. The ever exploitative and decadent Bandit Empire will leave a lasting scar on the Ynn, and North Aelantir as a whole. Much to the joy of the now Bandit Emperors."
    flavor_newhavoral.10.t:0 "The Lucky Ones"
    flavor_newhavoral.10.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. Pillaging in conquered lands is normal in New Havoral, but a soft spot is shown when the raiding parties spare many Halfling towns. Soon, Halfling land in New Havoral is seen as integral parts to the kingdom, with mutual tolerance increasing. It is still mostly one way, however."
    flavor_newhavoral.11.t:0 "The Havoral Band"
    flavor_newhavoral.11.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOC. The Havoral Band is led by bandits, vagrants and generally unpleasant folk. They are fickle and often don't work with one another. The administrative abilities of the Band are harshly limited as a result."
