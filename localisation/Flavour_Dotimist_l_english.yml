Those who will enter the Dream today carry the Dotim from their sacred shrines to the central Dotimveb and place them reverently on their altar. Only then are the fires stoked and filled with seasoned herbs, the smoke of which rapidly fills the domed temple. As the haze in the air grows, so do the shadows lengthen and distort, the colours deepen with ochre and vermillion, and the supplicants slip into the Dance of Dreams. The communion begins.\n\n[Root.GetAspect1Influence]\n[Root.GetAspect2Influence]\n[Root.GetAspect3Influence]\n\n§BCombining the correct influences when performing a ritual will allow us to deepen our knowledge and unlock new aspects.§!"

 dotimist_flavour.4.t:0 "The Dream of the World Above"
 dotimist_flavour.4.desc:0 "As the veil of physical reality falls away, the mind enters the Dance of Dreams, tugged ever forward into communion with the Aspects of the World.\n\nFrom the embrace of Grandmother Sky, whose face is as wide as the horizon and whose visage is ever-changing as the wind, a form comes to the dreamers. With skin of ebon and wings of midnight it arrives, the deep lines of its body radiating an acrid heat and glowing with the intensity of starfire. The Winged Beast lopes to you and stretches forth its talons, conveying its gratitude to have visitors, for it has been some time since Those Who Wake remembered its aspect.\n\nThe Beast and the dreamers walk the clouds of Grandmother Sky in companionship for some time, the sonorous trembling of its voice shaping the dew of the clouds as they pass. Here and there the vastness of the sky beneath parts and reveals the starry expanse below, and the Beast comments on that which is there. You nod, the truths it reveals leaving you as soon as the trembling mist ceases.\n\nThe Beast halts the dreamers, waving to the mausoleum that stands before, its cyclopean stones crumbling from age. Within is The Winged Beast, its massive bulk stony and unmoving, a living statue entombed by its own weight. The chisel of its maker rests at the Beast’s feet, the ruby point still warm where it drove deep into the flaming heart of the body. The Beast beside you nods its pallid face at its imprisonment before turning away to finish its flight. As the dream begins to fade, the beast warns you against further excursions into the Dance - for without proper guidance from one such as it, the mind may not endure what it witnesses."
 dotimist_flavour.4.a:0 "The Dream Fades"
 
 dotimist_flavour.5.t:0 "The Dream of All-Things"
 dotimist_flavour.5.desc:0 "As the veil of physical reality falls away, the mind enters the Dance of Dreams, tugged ever forward into communion with the Aspects of the World.\n\nThe Dance is alive with a shifting mirage of colour, of hues and shades known by no artist but craved by any who have ever longed for a masterpiece. The shifting and whirling mists of rainbow contain hints of the thoughts that birthed them - the unconscious psyche of All Things. Here in the violet is the passion of mating; in red, there is the rage of war and combat; in the blue can the wind be felt beneath one’s wings and the water flowing over their gills. Green carries all the hope of life and spring, adjacent to the brown earth in which all the multi-legged crawling beings skitter.\n\nThe colors suffuse the Dance of Dreams, coming from nowhere and everywhere, their omnipresence even obscuring the earth far below. You are enveloped by the sensation of the colors, and in the rapture of All-Things time loses what little meaning it has in the Dance. To bask in the colors of connection is all that matters.\n\nBut then, as if on a whim, the colors change, paling and darkening all at once. The cacophony of sensations becomes one of dread and creeping chill - the oncoming frost of winter, the sleeping and the dying of the season, the dormancy from which many do not wake. Before the change can overtake you entirely, you retreat, wrenching yourself from the All-Things that you were briefly a part of."
 dotimist_flavour.5.a:0 "The Dream Fades"
 
 dotimist_flavour.6.t:0 "The Dream of the River"
 dotimist_flavour.6.desc:0 "As the veil of physical reality falls away, the mind enters the Dance of Dreams, tugged ever forward into communion with the Aspects of the World.\n\nThe Dance is darkness as you arrive, an oblivion of sightless blindness and gentle heavy weight. It is neither warm nor cold in the void in which you float, nor does the space around you move with wind or current. Were it not for the knowledge that the dream was entered with others, it would be easy to forget that anything existed beyond the self. Such is the isolation of the Dance.\n\nTime passes, though how much is not possible to discern. And then, there is a presence - not a change in the nothing that surrounds the dreamers, but a presence nonetheless. It speaks, a strange whispering voice that is elongated and distorted, as if heard from great distance and through a substance thick as molasses. The words that flow to you are sweet things, questions of desires and promises of glories. The presence wants something from you in return, something it cannot voice without being asked by those it entreats. Of course, there is no way for you to speak, for your mouths are as much closed by the weight of the Nothing around you as your minds are frozen in terror by the implications of what the presence offers.\n\nThe presence grows disaffected at the lack of a response, and as suddenly as it arrived, it is gone. The lingering sound of its voice, the strange sound that almost reminds of lapping waves, will cling to the back of your mind for weeks to come."

 dotimist_flavour.7.t:0 "The Dream of Colder Times"
 dotimist_flavour.7.desc:0 "As the veil of physical reality falls away, the mind enters the Dance of Dreams, tugged ever forward into communion with the Aspects of the World.\n\nThe ocean around you is an icy gray as the waves wash over the long and narrow vessel on which you stand. The hull appears to be made entirely of freshly fallen snow, added to by the constant flurry descending from the slate colored sky, and the design of the ship is like nothing you have ever laid eyes upon before, alien and incomprehensible in the curvature of its masts and decks. The pounding waves that crash onto the deck carve great swathes in the crystalline powder that constitutes the ship, holes that rapidly diminish as fresh fallen snow fills in the damage.\n\nNear the middle of the deck on which you stand rises a vast pillar of blue steel, its sides reflective and perfectly smooth - save for the base of the side nearest you, where a humanoid hand has been nailed roughly into the steel, the metal deforming around the tortured flesh. The hand is attached to a short huddled figure that you only now notice, a great hood drawn up over its diminutive frame, dozens of individual ropes wrapping around its limbs. It does not seem to notice you, preoccupied as it is with the vessel, its arms twisting and tugging on ropes to move the masts, rigging, and tiller. Its efforts cause amber blood to drip from its mangled arm and fall to the snow at its feet, one of which also appears to have been spiked to the pillar. The slurry of blood and ice seeps towards the pillar, the metal seeming to drink the stream of orange-red.\n\nAs the boatman grunts and heaves the many ropes that control the vessel, a great reverberating scream erupts from within the pillar, a cry of agony and hunger amplified by the ringing metal of the steel stele. The sound seems to electrify the diminutive sailor, who redoubles its efforts at directing the course of the ship. The screaming of the Thing in the Pillar becomes a rolling sound reminiscent of laughter that sends an icy chill deeper than any snowstorm through your bones as you are expelled from the Dance. The sound continues to ring in your mind long after you awaken, the chill of the vision heavy on your limbs over the next day."

 dotimist_flavour.8.t:0 "The Dream of The Living"
 dotimist_flavour.8.desc:0 "As the veil of physical reality falls away, the mind enters the Dance of Dreams, tugged ever forward into communion with the Aspects of the World.\n\nThe meeting is a confluence of wind and sea and stone, Grandmother Sky’s endless expanse embracing Earth Brother’s granite skin and River Daughter’s lithe and supple form. Their voices come together as the chorus of the world itself, the sound of a silent summer day when no bird sings and only Halanna’s natural song flits through hill and dell. No words are spoken, not in any language spoken by mortals, but you understand their conversation regardless. They do not agree.\n\nGrandmother Sky is pensive as her words flow to her grandchildren. It has been some time since the three of them were gathered, so vast are their responsibilities. Such a gathering is reminiscent of an age long ago, when they were called together by a force stronger than they three, a being as old as the world. Grandmother Sky turns to you and speaks:\n"We know what you seek, there can only be one reason we are called together like this. It is as before. Each of us have failed in our ascension, we give you the fruits of that failure. From me you get compassion. For those who must suffer - the knowledge of what must come.”\nNext Earth Brother speaks “I give regret. For those who have failed- the mourning of that which was lost.“\nThe River Daughter hesitates for a moment, seeming uncertain, before finally speaking “I give… love. For those who have lost - the heat of a heart not yet broken."\n\nWith the final word you are ripped from the dream, forced back into the world and you can feel the gift you were bestowed: a burning fury in your heart."

 dotimist_flavour.9.t:0 "The Dream of Reshaping"
 dotimist_flavour.9.desc:0 "As the veil of physical reality falls away, the mind enters the Dance of Dreams, tugged ever forward into communion with the Aspects of the World.\n\nThe Path appears before you, and on it a hulking Beast with metal skin. You brought no weapons, but that does not matter for no weapon could harm the Beast of Stone. The Beast stands before a dirt path that reaches off into the heavens, the realm of the gods. You could travel to the realm of the gods from here - that is, if not for the Beast.\n\nThe Beast has been bound to this path since its creation and it cannot let you, it cannot leave its duty. You ponder for a moment on the Beast’s fate, it could not have wished for this and yet it does not resist.\n\nYou know you cannot pass, for the Beast is bound to protect the path, just as you are bound. You understand inevitability."
