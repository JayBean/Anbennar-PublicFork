 mages_estate_events.0.d:0 "War Wizards, as they are known, are mages of legend.\n\nNatural savants of the magical arts, they are a cut a thousand times above the ordinary mage, and are capable of destroying entire armies with a flick of their wrist. One such progidal individual originating from our Battlemage Academies have made themselves available for service."
 mages_estate_events.0.a:0 "They shall dominate the battlefield."
 mages_estate_events.1.t:0 "Advancement of Mage Power"
 mages_estate_events.1.d:0 "The status of the $ESTATE_MAGES$ does not rest on the privileges of the nobility or the clergy or the wealth of the merchants. Instead their fortune and power comes from their innate magical prowess. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. Despite being few in number, through the vast influence and power within our society the $ESTATE_MAGES$ have managed to increase their power over our country."

 mages_estate_events.2.t:0 "Decline of Mage Influence"
 mages_estate_events.2.d:0 "The balance of magic upon the kingdoms and nations of the world are always on the knife's edge of adoration or damnation.

 mages_estate_events.3.d:0 "It is no doubt that $ESTATE_MAGES$ suffer from the threat of the ever-rising influence of $ESTATE_ARTIFICERS$. Recent artificer discoveries have brought the age-old debate to light once again, on whether [Root.GetName] should stick with the old ways and harness magic traditionally, or use new innovations to control magic and make it available to all."

 mages_estate_events.4.t:0 "Magical Succession within the Nobility?"
 mages_estate_events.4.d:0 "Within Anbennar and much of Western Cannor magical rulers have been seen as wise and almost divinely chosen. A noble within our realm wishes push his house in that direction, and petitions us to disinherit his eldest in favour of a younger, more magically-gifted heir. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ within our realm warn that this goes against the very traditions that keep [Root.GetName] together, whilst the $ESTATE_MAGES$ subtly support one of their own in power, as usual."
 mages_estate_events.4.a:0 "Succession is succession, no matter what"

 mages_estate_events.5.d:0 "From magical explosions, to foul weather, to a mob of peasants turning into sheep - magical experiments and spells can and will go awry. The most recent case has been in [magical_spell_gone_wrong_province.GetName] which has damaged the province significantly. Angry mobs calls for the arrest, or worse, execution, of the wrong-doer whilst $ESTATE_MAGES$ of the province fear what this will mean for their current and future work."

 mages_estate_events.7.d:0 "Every now and then a mage of true talent makes themselves known to the realm and the world beyond. We are blessed to have such an esteemed and powerful individual in our realm - simple acknowledgment of his nature as one of us would be enough to please the $ESTATE_MAGES$ of our country though we could give such a talented individual our support and strengthen the $ESTATE_MAGES$ of our country even further."

 mages_estate_events.8.t:0 "Magical Academia in Financial Trouble"
 mages_estate_events.8.d:0 "This academic year has been disastrous for our $ESTATE_MAGES$: they have underestimated their research, tools and spell reagent costs and are on the verge of ruining any sort of progress for the foreseeable future. If we were to subsidize the $ESTATE_MAGES$ we could save their efforts... or leave them to learn from their mistakes."
 mages_estate_events.8.a:0 "Give them some money"

 mages_estate_events.9.d:0 "The $ESTATE_MAGES$ of our realm have begun using their increasing wealth and power to buy land in alarming numbers... not only for private residences and institutes of magic, but founding their own business, organizations and other sources of income. Some courtiers allude that this might be a greater plot for the mages to undermine the powers of the other estates and the country itself... or it could be the natural way of things go when people get rich and powerful."

 mages_estate_events.12.d:0 "Magic is a powerful tool, and no more can it be seen with the powerful and influential $ESTATE_MAGES$ of [Root.GetName]. However, while useful in infinitely different ways, it can lead to the belief that magic is the solution to everything.\n\nThe magic users in our realm seek to impose this same outlook, for they claim it benefits both them and the country as a whole."

 mages_estate_events.16.d:0 "With very little oversight from the state, the Magical Guilds have a lot of say and control over how their mages are taught and what principles matter to them. Without rigorous training to the laws of [Root.Country.GetName] several mages have caused chaos throughout the country, blasting and casting spells openly and thus harming the reputation of mages everywhere."
