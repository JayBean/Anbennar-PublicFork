They denounce our taxation of the peasantry and the tariffs we extract along the river, especially excoriating the tithe we extract from pilgrims traveling along the Righteous Highway.\n\nThese dissidents, led by a young and charismatic sage of the School of Flowing Water named Shang Shui, have begun calling themselves the Blue Scarves and invoking the name and cause of Lanjinhui as if they are righteous or justified in their dissent. Today emissaries arrived in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] with a concerning message: these Blue Scarves have assembled a militia and raised their banners in open revolt, and many towns in the former lands of Lanjinhui have joined them in this folly.
