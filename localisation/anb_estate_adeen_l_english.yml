 ### Adeen Estate
 ########################
 ########################
 estate_adeen:0 "House Of the Adeen"
 estate_adeen_desc:0 "This estate represents the Adeen that serve your country. Specialist slave soldiers who are trained as artillerists and marines."
 estate_adeen_land_rights:0 "$ESTATE_NAME$ Land Rights"
 estate_adeen_ownership:0 "Adeen Land Ownership"
 adeen_influence_modifier:0 "Adeen Influence"
 adeen_loyalty_modifier:0 "Adeen Loyalty Equilibrium"

 estate_adeen_strict_drills:0 "Strict Drilling"
 estate_adeen_strict_drills_desc:0 "Mandating a strict regimen of exercises for our Adeen will pay dividends, not only for the organisation of their elite regiments, but for the common soldiery with whom they coordinate. Few relish such an exacting lifestyle, however, and this is sure to be unpopular."
 estate_adeen_choice_of_mounts:0 "Choice of Mounts"
 estate_adeen_choice_of_mounts_desc:0 "The Adeen who serve as cavalry live their life at mount, and are undeniably more disciplined and effective than their counterparts in the nobility. Through royal seizure of elephants we can ensure that they are as well-equipped as possible, though of course the nobility is sure to take issue."
 estate_adeen_open_the_coffers:0 "Open the Coffers to Artillerists"
 estate_adeen_open_the_coffers_desc:0 "A life of war does not come cheap, and among the Adeen it is well known that they owe their effectiveness as much to the bursary as to the training ground. The supply chains which outfit our artillerists in powder and shot are particularly fickle and prone to disruption; only by giving their quartermasters carte blanche over sourcing can we maintain the highest possible artillery standards."
 estate_adeen_heavy_complements:0 "Heavy Shipboard Complements"
 estate_adeen_heavy_complements_desc:0 "The discipline and ferocity of the Adeen is as useful at sea as on land. Diverting Adeen to warships, however unpopular it might be among the slave-soldiers themselves, provides gunnery crews and boarding parties with a deadly edge."
 estate_adeen_naval_infantry_training:0 "Naval Infantry Training"
 estate_adeen_naval_infantry_training_desc:0 "The Adeen have always served as marine infantry in our navy, raiding inland and fighting ship-to-ship during naval actions. By introducing a course of amphibious training as part of the honing of the Adeen, we can conduct fearsome terror raids on the outposts and ports of our rivals."
 estate_adeen_professional_supply:0 "Professional Supply"
 estate_adeen_professional_supply_desc:0 "Amateurs study tactics, veterans study strategy, but professionals study logistics. While the officer corps of noble-led armies might turn their noses up at what they regard as the work of shopkeepers and clerks, our Adeen have no such qualms. Formal colleges of logistics help our forces deploy and supply faster, however far from home they fight."
 estate_adeen_adeen_armories:0 "Adeen Armories"
 estate_adeen_adeen_armories_desc:0 "So as the family trade of the wainwright is to make carts, the family trade of the Adeen is to make war. Wives and children employed alongside their men will build communities of expert gunsmiths who pass their knowledge down over the generations, giving us a distinct advantage on land and at sea."
 estate_adeen_intensive_siege_training:0 "Intensive Siege Training"
 estate_adeen_intensive_siege_training_desc:0 "Sieges are a nightmare for any army; they breed disease and even more dangerously boredom, and offer no loot to assuage the costs of a campaign. Professional Adeen, trained at length in siegecraft and camp logistics, will help us end these costly deadlocks quickly."
 estate_adeen_power_over_the_throne:0 "Power Over the Throne"
 estate_adeen_power_over_the_throne_desc:0 "The Adeen have seized control of our government, and now hold our ruler hostage in their own palace."
 estate_adeen_control_of_the_army:0 "Control of the Army"
 estate_adeen_control_of_the_army_desc:0 "The Adeen are less self-serving, more disciplined and more effective than our traditional military, and nobility in charge of Adeen armies are increasingly rendered figureheads, exasperating their more competent Adeen lieutenants. Cutting out these irritating intermediaries could do a lot to ensure the ongoing loyalty of the Adeen officer corps."
 estate_adeen_support_adeen_families:0 "Support Adeen Families"
 estate_adeen_support_adeen_families_desc:0 "What is the widow’s reward for sacrificing her husband to the state? Too often, practically nothing. Adeen who know their wives and children will be left destitute by their deaths will fight timorously and pull their punches. A family fund for serving Adeen who die or are rendered unable to fight will do much to sweeten the taste of loss."
 estate_adeen_allow_employment:0 "Allow Employment"
 estate_adeen_allow_employment_desc:0 "Aside from the Adeen, slaves in our lands are permitted to seek employment outside of the periods in which their master needs their services. Extending this privilege to the Adeen will do much to stymy discontent among their ranks, but it may also impact their ability to fight for us."
 estate_adeen_land_grants_for_adeen:0 "Land Grants for Adeen"
 estate_adeen_land_grants_for_adeen_desc:0 "The award of land for exemplary service is an old tradition for the Adeen, but over time the expectation for land grants has become near-universal among the Adeen rank-and-file. Formalising this privilege will greatly enhance their power and influence, especially rurally, but it will also create direct ties of loyalty between them and the government."
 estate_adeen_allow_adeen_halqa:0 "Allow Halqa"
 estate_adeen_allow_adeen_halqa_desc:0 "The idea of giving Adeen the right to establish and administer their own autonomous communities, or "Halqa", is controversial to say the least. It is not an idea without merit, though. Partial self-government will help reduce friction between the Adeen and our local bureaucracies, and will serve as a powerful gesture of trust."
 estate_adeen_rights_of_collection:0 "Rights of Tax Farming"
 estate_adeen_rights_of_collection_desc:0 "While the Adeen are first and foremost soldiers, they also serve minor roles in the state bureaucracy, which brings them into contact with our wider administration. Some of these Adeen have requested to be granted license as tax farmers, responsible for collecting income in the same way a noble would. While this would do much to win their favour, it also opens the door to one of the most ancient forms of corruption."
 estate_adeen_privilege_of_first_speech:0 "Privilege of the First Speech"
 estate_adeen_privilege_of_first_speech_desc:0 ""He who speaks first decides what is spoken" - so goes Bootan Tembo’s immortal quip, and the Adeen remember it well. Possessing as slaves no power but that granted by their masters, they request to be heard first in the order of events at court, the traditional position of the humblest supplicant."
 estate_adeen_reward_incentives:0 "Reward Incentives"
 estate_adeen_reward_incentives_desc:0 "Giving the Adeen financial rewards for their hardship on extended campaign is a simple if expensive option to ensure their loyalty. A promise of reward followed by disappointment, however, is likely to do more damage than silence."

 estate_adeen_focus_on_merfolk:0 "Focus on Merfolk Adeen"
 estate_adeen_focus_on_merfolk_desc:0 "Few Merfolk end up serving in the Adeen, due to their inability to travel on land. However, those few we have are effective fighters at sea, and merfolk squadrons boast near-unmatched naval prowess. Employing more merfolk will boost our ability to project power on the waves."
 estate_adeen_focus_on_harpies:0 "Focus on Harpy Adeen"
 estate_adeen_focus_on_harpies_desc:0 "Harpy slaves from Nalayni are an exotic sight in our land, though not as exotic as they once were. Those few who have found their way into the Adeen have proven their military prowess, and the employment of more harpy auxiliaries will allow us to fly rings around static fortifications."
 estate_adeen_focus_on_lizardfolk:0 "Focus on Lizardfolk Adeen"
 estate_adeen_focus_on_lizardfolk_desc:0 "With the importation of large numbers of Lizardfolk slaves, the opportunity has come for them to serve in our Adeen. Their great strength will be invaluable in operating heavy cannons, and their ferocity in battle makes them ideal shock troops."
 estate_adeen_traditional_adeen:0 "Traditional Adeen"
 estate_adeen_traditional_adeen_desc:0 "The Adeen are slave soldiers employed by the kingdoms of the Baashidi, emerging over time from corps of enslaved guardsmen who defended the property of important personages. The Adeen occupy all aspects of the military but are most well known for their ability as artillerists, an arm of the Baashidi military for which they are almost exclusively responsible."
 estate_adeen_adeen_curtailed:0 "Adeen curtailed"
 estate_adeen_adeen_curtailed_desc:0 "We have defeated the coup attempt of the Adeen, and made sure that such an attempt will not happen again."
 estate_adeen_adeen_integrated:0 "Adeen integrated"
 estate_adeen_adeen_integrated_desc:0 "After existing as a separate entity in our nation for much of their existence, the Adeen have now been fully integrated into our nation."

 estate_adeen.1.t:0 "The Rise of the House of Adeen"
 estate_adeen.1.d:0 "Manning artillery is dirty, heavy and menial work. As a result, the farsighted Baashidi potentates who so eagerly adopted the technology promptly handed over its operation to troupes of enslaved workers. These crews enjoyed better living conditions and perks than their domestic or agricultural brethren, and found themselves increasingly prized and indispensable on the battlefield. An Adeen, or ‘’servant’’ as these men came to be euphemistically addressed, could through sheer talent find himself on close terms with nobility or even royalty.\n\nThe more that warfare came to depend on the expert deployment of gunpowder, the more influential and necessary the Adeen became - not merely because of the gunners themselves, but also the drilling, logistical and supply networks attached to them. Even the court in Bhuvauri came to understand the value of such trained slave corps, mimicking their trade partners in the distant south."
 estate_adeen.1.a:0 "They shall serve us well on the battlefield"

 estate_adeen.2.t:0 "Adeen abuse officer privileges"
 estate_adeen.2.d:0 "In almost all cases, the hierarchy of free and enslaved is clear and absolute. Rules and standards of deference govern every sentence spoken between the possessor and the possessed. Seating, eating, sleeping - the circumstances and nature of all of these things change, and everyone’s relative position is clear.\n\nAs our Adeen have acquired more and more of the privileges and functions of the officer corps, however, these rules are being upended. In recent days, an Adeeni officer reprimanded and then publicly humiliated a freeborn noble man for his faulty manouevres during a training exercise, in a tone that harsh Adeeni taskmasters often use to sculpt the iron discipline of their fellow enslaved. This has caused outrage amongst the nobility, and a demand for the officer in question to be censured and fined."
 estate_adeen.2.a:0 "The Adeeni officer did no wrong"
 estate_adeen.2.b:0 "Issue a fine for the injustice"
 estate_adeen.2.c:0 "There shall be no quarrels in this army"

 estate_adeen.3.t:0 "Adeen families want more money"
 estate_adeen.3.d:0 "A petition has arrived to our court from an advocate, written on behalf of the families of several hundred wounded or dead Adeen. They claim that they have failed to receive the ongoing pension payments to which they are entitled, with these arrears stretching back over almost a decade in some cases. Various reasons for this have been cited: local corruption, lack of notification regarding eligibility for the payments, and occasionally simply clerical error.\n\nThe cost of paying out these pensions retroactively would be significant, but widows of the Adeen have an almost legendary status among their martial communities, and even our free citizenry hold them in significant esteem. It is unlikely they will go quietly if denied."
 estate_adeen.3.a:0 "Pay them"
 estate_adeen.3.b:0 "They are in error"

 estate_adeen.4.t:0 "The Adeen request more land"
 estate_adeen.4.d:0 "As part of an agreement with the House, we routinely issue small land grants to Adeeni officers as and when they retire; in such a way, small villages have been seeded in some of the toughest territory available to us, solidifying our rule. The request we have received this week, however, is very different. It requests a one-off land grant for the sons of Adeeni sharecroppers, who do not benefit from Adeeni land use rights unless they are also chosen for service as Adeen."
 estate_adeen.4.a:0 "They shall have it"
 estate_adeen.4.b:0 "We have nothing to give"

 estate_adeen.5.t:0 "Corruption in the Halqa"
 estate_adeen.5.d:0 "By agreement and convention with the House of Adeen, we allow their frontier communities or Halqa limited local self-government. While for the most part these communities are as lawful or lawless as any other rural township, their ability to sidestep local and regional trade laws has allowed a few Halqa to develop into notorious hotbeds of smuggling. As soon as an illegal item gets into a Halqa storehouse, its possession no longer falls under our petty criminal code; Halqa like these simply decriminalise any product they wish to move in their own jurisdictions. Bellicose courtiers argue that this is the precise issue inherent to these communities, and implore the government to at least make a strict example of the smuggling Halqa."
 estate_adeen.5.a:0 "Only punish the worst offenders"
 estate_adeen.5.b:0 "Conduct thourough purges"

 estate_adeen.6.t:0 "Theft among the tax farmers"
 estate_adeen.6.d:0 "When we gave the Adeen the rights to collect taxes on the state's behalf, we imagined that they might be more loyal than the usual officials. Sadly this has proven not to be the case, as several Adeen have been implicated in schemes to hide tax revenue from our treasury and falsify the total tax figure. After correcting the numbers, the shortfall is significant. This wealth rightly belongs in our coffers, but moving against these criminal Adeen might be viewed as scapegoating or even outright false arrest by the rest of the soldiers.\n\nIt may be better to simply accept the loss and only stop any further theft from being committed."
 estate_adeen.6.a:0 "That money belongs to the treasury"
 estate_adeen.6.b:0 "Let them know we're watching"

 estate_adeen.7.t:0 "Adeen manipulations"
 estate_adeen.7.d:0 "The privilege of speaking first on all matters has given the Adeen the ability to control councils with the sovereign and manipulate the topics of discussion on matters of import.\n\nA recent dispute over land surveys is a perfect example of this, as the Adeen have managed to create a web of political favors that positions themselves to the be the ultimate benefactors no matter what happens."
 estate_adeen.7.a:0 "The House of Might will suffer from this"
 estate_adeen.7.b:0 "The House of Wealth will suffer from this"
 estate_adeen.7.c:0 "The House of Wisdom will suffer from this"

 estate_adeen.8.t:0 "Rewards for the victorious Adeen"
 estate_adeen.8.d:0 "In recognition of the unusual risk and length of deployment to which the Adeen are exposed, we have promised reward stipends following active campaigns which utilise Adeen. As we have recently deployed the Adeen in war, our Adeen now expect this payment."
 estate_adeen.8.a:0 "They shall have their pay"
 estate_adeen.8.b:0 "They deserve no reward"

 estate_adeen.9.t:0 "Two lives"
 estate_adeen.9.d:0 "The practice of our Adeen finding outside employment during times of peace has caused us a great deal of frsutration during this war. Reticent Adeen not wanting to leave their businesses during times of war and influential merchants who don't want to lose their craftsmen both working against our mobilization. While this only represents a small part fo our military, it serves as an example to other deserters and puts our army in danger of degredation."
 estate_adeen.9.a:0 "Allow some to remain, provided they support the war effort"
 estate_adeen.9.b:0 "Their purpose is to be soldiers"

 estate_adeen.11.t:0 "The Adeen and the Republic"
 estate_adeen.11.d:0 "Our Adeen are a powerful force in our republic even if they lack the ability to vote or run for office as they property of the state. As the functionaries shift in our bureaucracy, the Adeen become bold and restless, asking for new pensions and privileges."
 estate_adeen.11.a:0 "The treasury shall pay them a bonus"
 estate_adeen.11.b:0 "Offer them spoilered postings"
 estate_adeen.11.c:0 "Grant them a new privilege"
 estate_adeen.11.z:0 "They serve at the Republic's pleasure, not theirs"

 estate_adeen.12.t:0 "The Adeen and the Crown"
 estate_adeen.12.d:0 "Upon the Ascession of a new Monarch, it is necessary to rotate the Adeen who guard the palace and fulfill other important roles. Replacing old veterans with fresh soldiers prevents the ossification of government and ensures their personal loyalty to the new ruler. However, the previous generation of Adeen notables cannot simply be dismissed at a whim."
 estate_adeen.12.a:0 "The treasury shall provide them generous retirements"
 estate_adeen.12.b:0 "Create new offices to 'promote' them"
 estate_adeen.12.c:0 "Grant them a new privilege"
 estate_adeen.12.z:0 "They serve at the crown's pleasure, not theirs"

 estate_adeen.13.t:0 "Integrating the House of Adeen"
 estate_adeen.13.d:0 "The House of Adeen has long stood beside and sometimes in direct opposition to the traditional military. As specialists and veterans they are near-unmatched, but two heads inevitably lead to conflict. For as long as the Adeen are unshackled from our conventional military, they are bound to consider themselves a coherent and independent force. Increasingly, voices in our government ask whether we would not be better off sheathing this dangerous weapon, or at least placing it under more direct control of the government."
 estate_adeen.13.a:0 "Start the process of integration"
 estate_adeen.13.b:0 "They work better as they are, what is the worst that could happen?"

 estate_adeen.14.t:0 "Adeen finally integrated"
 estate_adeen.14.d:0 "After a long and tricky process, the House of Adeen has been integrated more closely into our military, and no longer exists as a separate entity in our state. We may use slave soldiers, but no longer will they accrue separate and special power and influence. This is bound to increase stability and conformity, and will stop them from acting out of line in the future."
 estate_adeen.14.a:0 "Finally the process is done"

 estate_adeen.100.t:0 "The Adeen coup"
 estate_adeen.100.d:0 "It happens with the clockwork precision of a people literally owned for war. Every man in an Adeen regiment has another purpose - he is a gunner, or a cannoneer, or a logistician, or a signaller - and each, for a certain kind of arrogant nobleman, is completely invisible. The friends of their wives cook in palace kitchens, their children’s playmates know where the keys to the fastness are kept, and after a certain time, they must ask - who is it that truly keeps this country going? There was a time when the nobility at least fulfilled a military purpose, but they have proved too lazy for even that, and it will be their folly.\n\nMore than anything, it is everyone’s surprise which makes this possible. Before any real response can be mustered, the Adeen are in position, well shielded from the city walls’ range of fire, surrounding it on all sides and dug in. They have been subtler within the city - if there are truly Adeen spies at the heart of the capital, they are saving their betrayals for when the walls fall. A city and a country hold their breath together."
 estate_adeen.100.a:0 "How dare they!?"

 estate_adeen.101.t:0 "Adeen coup put down"
 estate_adeen.101.d:0 "The general’s grisly trophy is revealed as the sun rises over [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Two hundred Adeen, arranged as if at parade rest, impaled on seven foot stakes, each protruding like some ghastly tongue from the mouth of the victim. They are the part which signifies the whole, and even as people cross the plaza, averting their eyes, thousands more are being hunted down in their beds. Every sympathetic lover who left a palace door unlocked, every sister who hid ordnance in the pantry, every child who went as go-between - their fate will be the same, and the revenge will be complete.\n\nFrom here, there is only a mopping-up to be done. The resistance’s back has been broken, and we have reasserted the true order of things."
 estate_adeen.101.a:0 "They should have known their place"

 estate_adeen.102.t:0 "Palace Coup"
 estate_adeen.102.d:0 "’They are extraordinarily polite.’ This is the impression the young lady gets, when, presented with armed men bursting into her room with rifles in hand, she cannot stop herself from making the proper movements - the nod, the gentle, quavering greeting. A young lady like this will always make such movements, such niceties, because she is raised this way and, in this particular case, is essentially conventional. An invading soldier, however, will not always return her deference, will not always guide her swiftly and silently through the halls of the palace, and check on her all the way to the postern gate.\n\nShe drifts a little while down the street, and finds a group of well-dressed ladies much like herself, who are gasping and muttering because a wing of the palace has been set ablaze - a wing that they personally know to contain exquisite tea-rooms. They can see the fire from here, and it is, after all, something to do while one is couped. There are seven or eight silent men around them, also with rifles, so unnervingly still that it is as if they are not there at all.\n\nThere is an explosion. Cannonfire, even the young lady knows this, because she has heard it in parades, and because it is the specialty of the Adeen. It will not be until the next morning that she learns this was the moment that the [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle]’s tower was breached and the polite, silent men poured in."
 estate_adeen.102.a:0 "It is their country now"

 estate_adeen.103.t:0 "More Adeen join the coup"
 estate_adeen.103.d:0 "Adeen in [revolt_target.GetName] have risen up to join the coup."
