 estate_adeen_choice_of_mounts_desc:0 "The Adeen who serve as part of cavalry are highly effective soldiers, more disciplined and effective than the nobles who make up the bulk.

 estate_adeen_open_the_coffers:0 "Open the Coffers to Artillerists"
 estate_adeen_open_the_coffers_desc:0 "It is an unspoken truth among the Adeen that their effectivness in battle in comes from the coin spent on them. Each string of cowries and pearls buys powder and shot to hone skills that make them a terror on the battlefield. Giving the artillerists a blank check to secure these supplies is an expensive but effective way to ensure their deadliness on the field."
 estate_adeen_heavy_complements:0 "Heavy Shipboard Complements"
 estate_adeen_heavy_complements_desc:0 "Increasing the number of Adeen serving aboard our warships can only make our crews more fierce in battle. But the heavy strain on personnel will surely strain the loyalites of the Adeen."

 estate_adeen_intensive_siege_training:0 "Intensive Siege Training"
 estate_adeen_intensive_siege_training_desc:0 "Sieges are a nightmare for army, a situation rife with disease and boredom, where no loot is collected to assuage the costs of the campaign. Professional soldiers like the Adeen can be a saving grace here, and ensuring they are properly trained in siege warfare is worth any cost."

 estate_adeen_land_grants_for_adeen_desc:0 "Granting parcels of land to Adeen as a reward for exemplary service is an old tradition, but now all our Adeen expect such a gift. Making this a formal privilege of the Adeen will greatly enhance their power but also make them loyal to the ruler."
 estate_adeen_allow_adeen_halqa:0 "Allow Halqa"
 estate_adeen_allow_adeen_halqa_desc:0 "Giving the Adeen the right to administrate their own communities is a controversial step but one that does not lack rewards. By assigning adminstrative territories to Adeen we can reduce the friction our bureaucracy has the with the powerful slave soldiers and make them happy with our rule."
 estate_adeen_rights_of_collection:0 "Rights of Tax Farming"
 estate_adeen_rights_of_collection_desc:0 "While the Adeen are first and foremost soldiers, they also serve minor roles in the state bureacracy, which brings them into contact with our wider administration. Some of these Adeen have requested to begiven license as tax farmers, responsible for collecting income in the same way a noble would. This gives an opportunity to bind the Adeen further to us, but also gives space for corruption to grow amongst them."

 estate_adeen_focus_on_harpies:0 "Focus on Harpy Adeen"
 estate_adeen_focus_on_harpies_desc:0 "Harpy slaves from Nalayni are an exotic sight in our land, though not as exotic as they once were.

 estate_adeen_focus_on_lizardfolk:0 "Focus on Lizardfolk Adeen"
 estate_adeen_focus_on_lizardfolk_desc:0 "With the importation of large numbers of Lizardfolk slaves, the opportunity has come for them to serve in our Adeen. Their great strength will be invaluable in operating heavy cannons, and their ferocity in battle makes them ideal shock troops."

 estate_adeen_traditional_adeen_desc:0 "The Adeen are slave soldiers employed by the kingdoms of the Baashidi, evolved from enslaved guardsmen who worked for the houses of important personages.

 estate_adeen.1.a:0 "They shall serve us well on the battlefield"

 estate_adeen.2.t:0 "Adeen abuse officer privileges"
 estate_adeen.2.d:0 "For some time discontent has been brewing among the nobility serving in our armies, denied a position of primacy while the Adeen are responsible for running our military. The recent incident of a young noble being humiliated during a training exercise has become a rallying cry for the nobility and our actions on it will show our position in this struggle."
 estate_adeen.2.a:0 "The Adeeni officer did no wrong"
 estate_adeen.2.b:0 "Issue a fine for the injustice"
 estate_adeen.2.c:0 "There shall be no quarrels in this army"

 estate_adeen.3.t:0 "Adeen families want more money"
 estate_adeen.3.d:0 "A petition has arrived from the families of our Adeen, who claim that the state has denied them funds rightfully theirs by privilege of their husbands and fathers, coming to a considerable sum over the years they claim this happened."
 estate_adeen.3.a:0 "Pay them"
 estate_adeen.3.b:0 "They are in error"

 estate_adeen.4.t:0 "The Adeen request more land"

 estate_adeen.4.b:0 "We have nothing to give"

 estate_adeen.5.t:0 "Corruption in the Halqa"
 estate_adeen.5.d:0 "Since we have allowed the Adeen the privilege of self governing communities, many at court have been wary of the potential for these soldiers to resist taxation and tarriffs as well as the force of the law.

 estate_adeen.5.a:0 "Only punish the worst offenders"
 estate_adeen.5.b:0 "Conduct thourough purges"

 estate_adeen.6.t:0 "Theft among the tax farmers"
 estate_adeen.6.d:0 "When we gave the Adeen the rights to collect taxes on the state's behalf, we imagined that they might be more loyal than the usual officials. Sadly this has proven not to be the case, as several Adeen have been implicated in schemes to hide tax revenue from our treasury and falsify the amount declared collected. After correcting the numbers, the shortfall is significant. This wealth rightly belongs in our coffers, but moving aginst these criminal Adeen might be viewed as false accusations by the rest of the soldiers.\n\nIt may be better to simply accept the loss and just stop any further theft from being committed."
 estate_adeen.6.a:0 "That money belongs to the treasury"
 estate_adeen.6.b:0 "Let them know we're watching"

 estate_adeen.7.t:0 "Adeen manipulations"
 estate_adeen.7.d:0 "The privilege of speaking first on all matters has given the Adeen the ability to control councils with the sovereign and manipulate the topics of discussion on matters of import.\n\nA recent dispute over land surveys is a perfect example of this, as the Adeen have managed to create a web of political favors that positions themselves to the be the ultimate benefactors no matter what happens."
 estate_adeen.7.a:0 "The House of Might will suffer from this"

 estate_adeen.8.a:0 "They shall have their pay"
 estate_adeen.8.b:0 "They deserve no reward"

 estate_adeen.9.t:0 "Two lives"
 estate_adeen.9.d:0 "The practice of our Adeen finding outside employment during times of peace has caused us a great deal of frsutration during this war. Reticent Adeen not wanting to leave their businesses during times of war and influential merchants who don't want to lose their craftsmen both working against our mobilization. While this only represents a small part fo our military, it serves as an example to other deserters and puts our army in danger of degredation."
 estate_adeen.9.a:0 "Allow some to remain, provided they support the war effort"
 estate_adeen.9.b:0 "Their purpose is to be soldiers"

 estate_adeen.11.t:0 "The Adeen and the Republic"
 estate_adeen.11.d:0 "Our Adeen are a powerful force in our republic even if they lack the ability to vote or run for office as they property of the state. As the functionaries shift in our bureaucracy, the Adeen become bold and restless, asking for new pensions and privileges."

 estate_adeen.11.c:0 "Grant them a new privilege"
 estate_adeen.11.z:0 "They serve at the Republic's pleasure, not theirs"

 estate_adeen.12.t:0 "The Adeen and the Crown"
 estate_adeen.12.d:0 "Upon the Ascession of a new Monarch, it is necessary to rotate the Adeen who guard the palace and fulfill other important roles. Replacing old veterans with fresh soldiers prevents the ossification of government and ensures their personal loyalty to the new ruler. However, the previous generation of Adeen notables cannot simply be dismissed at a whim."
 estate_adeen.12.a:0 "The treasury shall provide them generous retirements"
 estate_adeen.12.b:0 "Create new offices to 'promote' them"
 estate_adeen.12.c:0 "Grant them a new privilege"
 estate_adeen.12.z:0 "They serve at the crown's pleasure, not theirs"

 estate_adeen.13.t:0 "Integrating the House of Adeen"
 estate_adeen.13.d:0 "The House of Adeen has long existed as a separate entity in our state, but perhaps the time has come to integrate them more closely into our military?"
