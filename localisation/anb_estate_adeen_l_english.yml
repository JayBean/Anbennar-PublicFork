 estate_adeen.2.t:0 "Adeen Abuse Officer Privileges"
 estate_adeen.2.d:0 "For some time discontent has been brewing among the nobility serving in our armies, denied a position of primacy while the Adeen are responsible for running our military. The recent incident of a young noble being humiliated during a training exercise has become a rallying cry for the nobility and our actions on it will show our position in this struggle."

 estate_adeen.4.b:0 "We Have Nothing to Give"

 estate_adeen.5.t:0 "Corruption in The Halqa"
 estate_adeen.5.d:0 "Since we have allowed the Adeen the privilege of self governing communities, many at court have been wary of the potential for these soldiers to resist taxation and tarriffs as well as the force of the law. It seems that these fears are not unfounded, as the Halqa ave become hotspots of crime, which while minor, undermines our ability to rule and fosters corruption in the rest of our realm."

 estate_adeen.6.t:0 "Theft Among The Tax Farmers"
 estate_adeen.6.d:0 "When we gave the Adeen the rights to collect taxes on the state's behalf, we imagined that they might be more loyal than the usual officials. Sadly this has proven not to be the case, as several Adeen have been implicated in schemes to hide tax revenue from our treasury and falsify the amount declared collected. After correcting the numbers, the shortfall is significant. This wealth rightly belongs in our coffers, but moving aginst these criminal Adeen might be viewed as false accusations by the rest of the soldiers.\n\nIt may be better to simply accpet the loss and just stop any further theft from being committed."

 estate_adeen.6.b:0 "Let Them Know We're Watching"

 estate_adeen.7.t:0 "Adeen Manipulations"
 estate_adeen.7.d:0 "The privilege of speaking first on all matters has given the Adeen the ability to control councils with the sovereign and manipulate the topics of discussion on matters of import.\n\nA recent dispute over land surveys is a perfect example of this, as the Adeen have managed to create a web of political favors that positions themselves to the be the ultimate benefactors no matter what happens."

 estate_adeen.8.b:0 "They deserve no reward"

 estate_adeen.9.t:0 "Two Lives"
 estate_adeen.9.d:0 "The practice of our Adeen finding outside employment during times of peace has caused us a great deal of frsutration during this war. Reticent Adeen not wanting to leave their businesses during times of war and influential merchants who don't want to lose their craftsmen both working against our mobilization. While this only represents a small part fo our military, it serves as an example to other deserters and puts our army in danger of degredation."
 estate_adeen.9.a:0 "Allow Some To Remain, Provided They Support the War Effort"
 estate_adeen.9.b:0 "Their Purpose is to be Soldiers"

 estate_adeen.11.t:0 "The Adeen and the Republic"
 estate_adeen.11.d:0 "Our Adeen are a powerful force in our republic even if they lack the ability to vote or run for office as they property of the state. As the functionaries shift in our bureaucracy, the Adeen become bold and restless, asking for new pensions and privileges."
