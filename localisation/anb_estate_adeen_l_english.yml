 estate_adeen_rights_of_collection:0 "Rights of Tax Farming"
 estate_adeen_rights_of_collection_desc:0 "While the Adeen are first and foremost soldiers, they also serve minor roles in the state bureacracy, which brings them into contact with our wider administration. Some of these Adeen have requested to begiven license as tax farmers, responsible for collecting income in the same way a noble would.

 estate_adeen.5.t:0 "Corruption in The Halqa"
 estate_adeen.5.d:0 "Since we have allowed the Adeen the privilege of self governing communities, many at court have been wary of the potential for these soldiers to resist taxation and tarriffs as well as the force of the law.

 estate_adeen.6.t:0 "Theft Among The Tax Farmers"
 estate_adeen.6.d:0 "When we gave the Adeen the rights to collect taxes on the state's behalf, we imagined that they might be more loyal than the usual officials. Sadly this has proven not to be the case, as several Adeen have been implicated in schemes to hide tax revenue from our treasury and falsify the amount declared collected. After correcting the numbers, the shortfall is significant. This wealth rightly belongs in our coffers, but moving aginst these criminal Adeen might be viewed as false accusations by the rest of the soldiers.\n\nIt may be better to simply accpet the loss and just stop any further theft from being committed."

Reticent Adeen not wanting to leave their businesses during times of war and influential merchants who don't want to lose their craftsmen both working against our mobilization.
