 flavor_moredhal.1.t:0 "An Unexpected Offer"
 flavor_moredhal.1.d:0 ""One of our foremost scholars, Sven Clifford, has taken to venturing into the Cannwood whenever he is struggling with a particularly intractable problem. As he stalked the woods, muttering to himself, he happened upon a group of surprisingly well-dressed men and women, who invited him to their estate for tea. As he tells it:\n\n“They brought me to a fine mansion and entertained me lavishly for a week. While I was there, they taught me much about their history. It seems that they were high-ranking nobles in Adenica before the Greentide. When the orcs invaded, they held them off for as long as they could, but were eventually forced to retreat into the Cannwood, and it is in the Cannwood that they have remained.”\n\nThese men and women – who call themselves the Gentry of the Cannwood – have returned to our capital alongside Sven. They are eager to share their knowledge with our scholars, but there are some who fear that they may be foreign infiltrators – or worse. However, they are certainly charismatic, and their credentials seem to be sound. How should we proceed?""
 flavor_moredhal.1.a:0 "Let them speak with our scholars! They seem harmless enough."
 flavor_moredhal.1.b:0 "How could we have overlooked their presence? They must be foreign agents."
 flavor_moredhal.2.t:0 "The Gentry's Influence"
 flavor_moredhal.2.d:0 "The Gentry of the Cannwood have certainly made a splash in our little pond with their arrival. Effortlessly charismatic and supernaturally well-spoken, the upper-classes of our country have taken to them like ducks to water. The Gentry have been invited to dozens of balls and other such functions since they arrived in our capital alongside Sven Clifford, and their influence only seems to be growing. Indeed, our scholars seem to have become their most vociferous champions.\n\nOf late, however, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been struggling with the estates. They have grown particularly stubborn as regards a relatively routine piece of legislation, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] is becoming increasingly frustrated. It seems that this piece of legislation will not be passed… at least, until one of the Gentry requested an audience. Apparently, they have heard of our troubles with the estates and would like to offer their assistance. However, this will not come cheaply. Should we accept?"
 flavor_moredhal.2.a:0 "Yes! Let us target the nobility."
 flavor_moredhal.2.b:0 "Yes! Let us target the clergy."
 flavor_moredhal.2.c:0 "Yes! Let us target the merchant guilds."
 flavor_moredhal.2.e:0 "Yes! Let us target the patricians."
 flavor_moredhal.2.f:0 "Yes! Let us target the adventurers."
 flavor_moredhal.2.g:0 "Yes! Let us target the mages."
 flavor_moredhal.2.h:0 "Enough is enough! Get out of my residence and begone from here."
 flavor_moredhal.3.t:0 "The True Friends of [Root.Monarch.GetName]?"
 flavor_moredhal.3.d:0 "It is indisputable that the Gentry of the Cannwood have grown immensely. From a minor group of impoverished pre-Greentide nobles, they have become one of the strongest factions at court. Upon learning of how the Greentide was stopped by Corin, they have converted en masse to the Corinite faith – a wise decision, to be sure. At the same time, thanks to their multifarious connections amongst the upper-classes of our country, they have amassed a sizable treasury to be disbursed as they see fit. Truly, they are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nRecently, we have unveiled a new programme of legislation that has given rise to much discontent. Several public figures have spoken out against this, and seem to be fanning the flames. While we would like to resolve this issue, the cost may be too expensive for us to bear. Enter the Gentry, who have come to us with yet another deal. In exchange for formally enshrining their right to the Cannwood in the form of a legally binding contract of some sort, they will bear the cost of… convincing… these public figures to stand on our side. Alternatively, they could pay us the money that they would have used to bribe these figures. What will it be?"
 flavor_moredhal.3.a:0 "Go ahead with the plan."
 flavor_moredhal.3.b:0 "We’ll take the money, thank you very much."
 flavor_moredhal.3.c:0 "Begone! Such underhanded means are beneath us."
 flavor_moredhal.4.t:0 "Peacetime Breeds Complacence"
 flavor_moredhal.4.d:0 "“March properly, you fools!”\n\nOur drill sergeants may often be heard screaming this phrase at their poor recruits as they stumble back and forth on the training grounds. While our forces are indisputably mighty, their performance has been lacklustre of late. If only there was a way to strengthen them…\n\nEnter the Gentry, who have grown yet again in stature and might. While they seem to have entirely subsumed our government, we – the sovereigns and governors, who reside at the top of the pile – yet remain aloof from them. They have attempted to cajole us into attending their ceremonies, but we have always politely refused. Now, though… they seem to have realized that a stronger military is what we want, and are dangling bait in front of our eyes to convince us to worship Corin alongside them, instead of as we always have. Should we accept?"
 flavor_moredhal.4.a:0 "No price is too high to pay for a more capable military."
 flavor_moredhal.4.b:0 "No! The Gentry ask too much."
 flavor_moredhal.5.t:0 "A Worthy Heir?"
 flavor_moredhal.5.d:0 "Our relationship with the Gentry has continued to improve. Indeed, things have gotten to a point where we have been inducted into the organization ourselves, and worshipped at the feet of their true god, who is decidedly not Corin. And wouldn’t you like to know who that is?\n\nSince we purged the records, the non-human vermin that have been leaking into our country have seemed to understand that they are no longer welcome here. And they have been “helped along” by some of our more… zealous… compatriots. Good riddance, I say! Good riddance. The sooner they leave, the sooner we can restore Escann to its former glory.\n\nAnd one of the ways that we can do this is by ensuring that our heir, [Root.Heir.GetName], is worthy. Our compatriots have offered to ensure that [Root.Heir.GetName]’s abilities are greatly magnified through their rituals, and they have asked for nothing in return – merely our unyielding support. Which they already have. So what else remains to be done?"
 flavor_moredhal.5.a:0 "Yes! Let us submit [Root.Heir.GetName] to their tender ministrations."
 flavor_moredhal.5.b:0 "We should take a step back. This is a dangerous path."
 flavor_moredhal.6.t:0 "A Missive from Moredhal"
 flavor_moredhal.6.d:0 "A messenger from Moredhal presented himself to us today. He came in a shimmering raiment, atop a horse, attended by legions of orcs and tieflings. His gaze as it swept over us was benevolent, though with a hint of haughtiness, and when we demanded what his business was, he answered us simply:\n\n“I come with an invitation from the true sovereign of man. I come to bring you – wayward sons and daughters of Castanor – back into the fold. For we, Moredhal, are the true successors of Castanor, the greatest empire of man to exist, before or since. Join us… and retake your birthright. Join us… and march alongside us as we reclaim our place as Halann’s rightful rulers. Join us – for we are the inheritors and leaders of man.”\n\n“And if we refuse?” one of us dared to ask.\n\nThe messenger’s eyes turned black and flinty, and the orcs bared their tusks, and the tieflings stiffened. “Then you will perish,” he said, voice cold, “like our other enemies. For many fallen to our blade… and yet we still stand.”\n\nHe remains still, a pale, foreboding presence at all our public celebrations, casting a pallor over the proceedings. Much debate has accompanied this pronouncement of his, and we are no closer to a decision. Should we bend the knee to the greatest power in Escann? Or should we fight?"
 flavor_moredhal.6.a:0 "It’s not worth the effort. And I never liked those elves anyway."
 flavor_moredhal.6.b:0 "Never! Our ancestors died to keep us independent. Should we dishonour their sacrifices so? I think not!"
 flavor_moredhal.11.t:0 "Our Unwelcome Neighbors"
 flavor_moredhal.11.d:0 "Our country is faced with a dilemma. Since their invasion, Escann has ever been plagued by orcs. We have rounded them up and sent them to Aelantir to pay for their crimes, aye, but much remains to be done. There remains a sizable orcish element in our lands – an orcish question, if you will. And it demands a solution.\n\nThe military establishment – in conjunction with the Triadic Devotees - has proposed a solution. While the orcs are savage and utterly inhuman, and while our culture and creed theoretically forbids them from even residing within our borders, they can be useful. After all, they were able to destroy the weak Escanni kingdoms of yesteryear, which they did under the leadership of Korgus Dookanson. Dookanson – who died, as was proper, to a human – led them well. We will do better. Under our leadership, the orcs will serve as a near-infinite source of free bodies, throwing themselves against our enemies over and over again, sparing their human betters from risking their lives in battle.\n\nAn insurgent element in the military establishment – which is affiliated with the Grudgeknights – disagrees. Violently. They have charged the military establishment with being unfaithful to Kaz – er, Agrados’ ideals, and are vociferously supporting a wide-ranging purge of the orcish element. This move would likely serve to greatly boost our military readiness and preparedness by providing the troops with an adequate target to train their weapons on. No more play-fighting."
 flavor_moredhal.11.a:0 "To keep you is no benefit. To destroy you is no loss."
 flavor_moredhal.11.b:0 "Kill them all!"
 flavor_moredhal.12.t:0 "Oh shit, we collapsed"
 flavor_moredhal.12.d:0 "our bitch ass soldiers are FUCKING DEAD"
 flavor_moredhal.12.a:0 "rip"
 flavor_moredhal.13.t:0 "The evil is defeated"
 flavor_moredhal.13.d:0 "woo we killed 'em"
 flavor_moredhal.13.a:0 "fuck you"
 flavor_moredhal.14.t:0 "Everything For Victory"
 flavor_moredhal.14.d:0 "War! War has come to our country. Our reserves are running low, and our people grow tired – but this is no time to slacken. Victory is so close that we can almost taste it. Now, if only there was a way to strengthen ourselves…\n\nEnter the Gentry, who have grown yet again in stature and might. While they seem to have entirely subsumed our government, we – the sovereigns and governors, who reside at the top of the pile – yet remain aloof from them. They have attempted to cajole us into attending their ceremonies, but we have always politely refused. Now, though… they seem to have realized that support from the populace as regards this ongoing conflict is what we want, and are dangling bait in front of our eyes to convince us to worship Corin alongside them, instead of as we always have. Should we accept?"
 flavor_moredhal.14.a:0 "Victory is close at hand! Let us accept."
 flavor_moredhal.14.b:0 "No! The Gentry ask too much."
 flavor_moredhal.15.t:0 "Infestations Of Sorts"
 flavor_moredhal.15.d:0 "Our relationship with the Gentry has improved since we began worshipping Corin with them. They may hold certain, ah, unorthodox views, but it is impossible to deny that they have the best interests of this country in mind. With our tacit approval, they have continued to grow in strength and power, and they may now be said to be the dominant force in our country’s administration and society. Recently, one of their number has approached us with a proposition.\n\nIt is not hard to see that our people are relatively unwelcoming when it comes to non-human races. One of the men in service to the Gentry has been arrested for attacking and beating an elf to within an inch of his life. This event, for that matter, is but one of many. Hundreds of records of similar such attacks have been recorded, and we need but lift a finger to get the appropriate authorities to act on it. However, we have not done so, for the Gentry have expressed opposition to this move.\n\nNow, it seems, things are coming to a head. The Gentry tells us: “We will help to boost the economy and productivity of the country if you will permit these trifling matters to be buried.” This is not a trifling matter, though; this concerns the safety of elves, dwarves, and other such non-human (but civilized) races within our lands! How should we respond?"
 flavor_moredhal.15.a:0 "Let us turn a blind eye. Non-humans are not our concern."
 flavor_moredhal.15.b:0 "The law is the law, and we are bound to uphold it."
 flavor_moredhal.16.t:0 "Rise of the Sects"
 flavor_moredhal.16.d:0 "Moredhal rises! As the Gentry has grown in power and prestige to the point of overtaking the entirety of our country, there has arisen certain factions amongst their ranks who disagree over doctrine and priorities. (Some have called them cults.) While we, as the government, remain impartial, and while the Gentry needs must set aside their disagreements while wielding power, things are much different amongst the rank and file. There, three factions have emerged; the Passionates of Agrados, the Triadic Devotees, and the Grudgeknights.\n\nThe Passionates are sworn above all to Ildran, the Marquis of Pride, and Hedine, the Mistress of Lust. They are most concerned with religious doctrine and the establishment and maintenance of our culture. They are most represented amongst our administrative corps and the bureaucracy.\n\nThe Triadic Devotees are sworn above all to Ibberal, the Grand Duke of Gluttony, Forsara, the Countess of Greed, and Canturian, the Baron of Envy. They are most concerned with commerce and contracts, and believe that the accumulation of money and goods is the best way to benefit our country. They are most represented amongst our merchants.\n\nThe Grudgeknights are sworn above all to Kazraiel, the Wroth-Prince, and Mesner, the Lord of Sloth. Their foremost preoccupation is battle and valour, and much of their doctrine is based around the ancient Agradosian tribes, who worshipped Agrados first and foremost. They are most represented amongst our soldiery."
 flavor_moredhal.16.a:0 "Most worrisome."
 flavor_moredhal.17.t:0 "A Devilish Dynastic Dispute"
 flavor_moredhal.17.d:0 "At one of our most recent Festivals of the 7,777, [Root.Monarch.GetName] summoned a succubus. It was a fairly routine event, to be sure, but this succubus was… different. She was wonderful, and entrancing, and delightful in all the right ways… and all the wrong ways, too. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was taken in by her charms, and woke up the next morning in a forest-clearing, stark-naked. The affair was soon forgotten as just another night of debauchery, and life went on as normal.\n\nAt least, until [Root.Monarch.GetName] was rudely awoken this morn by the cries of a babe.\n\nIt appears that [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s tryst with the succubus has yielded a child, and not just any child – a half-devil child! What fun."

It was a fair contest… and victory was ours.\n\nMuch and more blood was shed for Gerudia, and the majority of it flowed from the Grudgeknights, who inaugurated and spearheaded this conquest. For their sacrifice, we shall deliver them Gerudia. And why not? They revere courage and violence above all else, and the Gerudians have that in spades. Gerudia, moreover, is a pure land, ruled by humans and humans alone… apart from the trolls, who will be dealt with. Our interest in the region was not sparked by those features alone, however, but by Gerudia’s position as the home of the Ebonfrost dynasty, which did so much for Castanor before the Witch King obliterated it and paved the way for the penetration of non-human filth into Cannor.\n\nOur loyal subjects, the Grudgeknights, have outlined their plans for Gerudia. The reavers - who had grown soft in their dotage - will be made hard again, and firm, as iron, through the steady destruction of the trollish element in the region. As the reavers carved out realms in Lencenor and Dameria in centuries past, so too shall our Grudgeknights become modern-day reavers, an army with a state, reshaping Gerudian society in Agrados’ image and restoring it to how it was when Black Castanor ruled./n/nAnd there are other considerations to take into account. To become a member of the Grudgeknights, one must pass a crushing array of tests and trials to be inducted into their ranks. We have received a number of complaints from them about the calibre of our people… and so it has been decided that they will be drawing from a new recruiting pool: the Olavish."
 B62_toxic_love_title:0 "Toxic Love"
 B62_toxic_love_desc:0 "The Deepwoods are ours! A festering sore to the south of our core territories, the Triadic Devotees planned and executed the invasion on their own merits. After much bloodshed, they succeeded - and now the Deepwoods bow to Moredhal. The elves who formerly claimed to rule in these parts are currently being held in camp-complexes, awaiting their eventual death. (As far as we are concerned, they are dead already.) As for the goblins… waste not, want not. They are fast-breeding little creatures, these goblins, and will serve in the slave-factories that the Devotees are constructing in the Deepwoods. It matters not if they work quickly or slowly, for there are always more of them. What are a few hundred deaths to a race such as theirs?\n\nThe Devotees have spoken passionately about their desire to remake the Deepwoods in Moredhal’s image. They plan to purge the forest from the region, to remove the Deepwoods from the Deepwoods, and to harvest its resources in a fashion that none of its previous inhabitants were able to. To further this purpose, however, more manpower is needed. More manpower… and more brutality. And there are none whom we consider better-suited to the task than our erstwhile subjects, the orcs. They shall be inducted into the hierarchy of the new Deepwoods under their human betters and put to work extracting as much value from their goblinoid inferiors as possible. With us in charge, the Deepwoods will yield more profit than ever before!\n\nThere are, of course, other considerations; after all, the Devotees have been grumbling about “government oversight”. The Deepwoods have never been a particularly lucrative territory. Thus, if we were to hand it over to the Devotees, we would lose almost nothing in terms of taxation and other such revenues. And if they transform it into an engine of industry… well, all to the good. Moreover, we have become cognizant of the need to guard against the threat to the east - the Dwarovar. Under the Devotees, the Deepwoods will serve as a shield against the dwarves and those goblins that remain in the mountains, repelling assaults and launching punitive expeditions should it be necessary. The dwarves have had their time; if they do not lay down and accept that we rule in these parts, then we shall teach them a sharp lesson. For too long, the Deepwoods have remained out of reach to humanity. Henceforth, it will be an integral part of our race’s birthright!"

 B62_city_on_a_hill_desc:0 "The Damesear is ours! That puddle of a lake - once such a mighty nuisance to the old Castanorians - has been subjugated in its entirety, and our troops now man countless fortifications along its coast. The locals remain rebellious and ungrateful, but no matter; they are not our concern. Instead, we have handed this region over to the Passionates of Agrados to administer and cleanse. For too long, the Damesear has been a poisonous thorn in Cannor’s proverbial side, expediting and facilitating the spread of the elven pestilence across Halcann. It has ever been a hotbed of heresy, promulgating the degenerate “Regent Court” of Castellos in opposition to the true faith of Agrados.\n\nNo more. With the Damesear in our hands, there is no reason for us not to take drastic measures to cut this rot out at its source, and the Passionates shall serve us in this regard. The heretics and knife-ears shall be given no quarter. We plan to smoke them out like rats, and slaughter them like the vermin they are. Camps there shall be, a great multitude of them, where such undesirables shall be sacrificed, their lifeblood used as mere fuel to feed the Great Work.\n\nWhat, may one ask, is the Great Work? It is a ritual, but not just any ritual; nay, it is the Ritual. The Passionates have been labouring over this enterprise for the longest time, and claim that it has the potential to free Agrados from his subterranean prison and unleash an age of unadulterated human supremacy. We, Agrados’ most devoted followers, shall be as gods, lesser deities at his knee, treated as equals by the likes of Kazraiel and Ildran. And all that it requires… is sacrifice.\n\nNot the mere sacrifice of lives, mind, but something deeper: the sacrifice of the spirit. In their camps, the Passionates mean to break the spirits of the imprisoned. It is true that the people of the Damesear resent their confinement, imprisonment, and oppression, and that they have been searching for ways to return to a time before Moredhal, but there is no escape. Moredhal is eternal. And it is the little deaths that shall fuel Agrados’ return - the quashing of hope, the smothering of faith, the silencing of conviction."
