 shaz_harvesting_finest_marble_title:0 "Harvesting The Finest Marble"
 shaz_harvesting_finest_marble_desc:0 "We, the working and sweating dwarves of the mountains of Serpentreach pride ourselves in our grit and hardiness. While we may be short and rigid, we are tough and resilient. Hence, we dutifully work hard for our pay, be it from trade or from barter. As such, we have been granted an opportunity from our ancestors a grand trade for a simple stone. The low-lying peoples of Bulwar seek our marble, as their grand palaces and structures require the resources of many lands - which includes ours. These elves, humans, whoever may it be, are very resourceful people. They understand the true gift of our hold, hence we must honor their wishes through the promise of marble."
 shaz_sell_said_marble_title:0 "To Sell Said Marble"
 shaz_sell_said_marble_desc:0 "Marble is an irresistible stone for many purposes. For any sculptors, a good piece of marble can lead to a spectacular piece of work like Alexandros síl Anbenncost’s ‘Dame de Milo’. For any aspiring architects, a supply of marble can lead to Balgar’s White Walls of Castanor. Fortunately for us, we are the marble hold, known to have the best marble, white as a cloud. Ever since the collapse of our ancient ancestors long ago, there has been a rising demand for marble to which the small mines around the world cannot supply. Their marble is lumpy, found with holes and discrepancies that don’t allow for proficient use of the stone.\n\nNow though? We have returned to provide. To make sure our trade networks are secure and that we can efficiently provide the demand for the stone, we must make sure that Shazstundihr can safely store the marble gained from the serpentreach and deep in its caves, and that it can also ship it out with ease. This may require a bit of expansion to the hold, but it’s nothing we can’t handle. The reward will be far greater than the expenses."
 shaz_the_food_basket_title:0 "The Food Basket"
 shaz_the_food_basket_desc:0 "With expansion always comes the problem of logistics. We have set our sights on bringing our prosperity to the rest of Bulwar, and for that we need to have the infrastructure to handle a larger population and and army. Ensuring we can provide food for the hungry will require significant investment from the council, because while this isn't the flashy side of expansion, it is needed."
 shaz_the_marble_road_title:0 "The Marble Road"
 shaz_the_marble_road_desc:0 "The Marble Road can only lead us so far. Trade across land is dangerous. After all, we did just expel hundreds of angry goblins from our lands. News of marble robbers have spread across the land, and the resources required to fund the caravans and their journeys has skyrocketed. It is still an option to continue forward with the road, but some of those in the White Stone Council have offered another idea.\n\n’Why not build a navy? Ask some elves and humans to sail across the sea. We can pay them.’\n\nThe prices for building a navy and paying these human and elven traders to set off and sell marble for us without dwarven guidance would be risky, but overall, if we do it well, it comes out as a net gain. The Marble Road can extend to the sea, and the trade would be ludicrous. All that is required now is the execution."
 shaz_greatest_little_port_title:0 "The Greatest Little Port"
 shaz_greatest_little_port_desc:0 "Brasan was an important port, for everything going in and out of Bulwar. There was no point in denying its key strategic value to all forms of trade, including its importance for the Marble Trade. Our ports of Aqatbar and Re’uyel simply cannot compete with the amount of outflowing trade coming from Brasan, even with our work and investments! If we are to secure the marble trade for good, and to assure a stable influx of cash instead of a highly unstable economy, Brasan must be secured.\n\nBrasan, after all, has been under subjugation by many kingdoms now, and has never been able to fully flourish due to mismanagement. Under our control, we suspect a massive increase in trade and importance for the city. Under our guidance, Brasan could become almost equal to the cities of Anbennar like Anbenncost! There are no downsides, at least nothing foreseeable. There are only investments, and they seem like they will return very shortly."
 shaz_new_world_port_title:0 "New World Port"
 shaz_new_world_port_desc:0 "Brasan has become the center of trade in the Divenhal, even outcompeting cities like Anbenncost and Damescrown, who have ruled the trade across Cannor, into Bahar, and across the north shores of Salahad. Brasan now sits atop a golden throne of riches and power, dictating the flow of trade. \n\nTo make sure that Brasan can keep up with these changes, finance is required to be put into the city. Its infrastructure, while not poor, is still lacking for the struggles and maintenance that lay ahead. Brasan’s port must be larger than the rest of the other ports near our shores combined, and its markets must expand so that they can be seen for miles. This will grant us the power we need for Brasan to sit upon a throne of power and wealth, and to become the New World Port."
 shaz_legacy_of_marble_title:0 "The Legacy Of Marble"
 shaz_legacy_of_marble_desc:0 "The process of making marble from a beautiful piece of natural rock to a beautiful piece of artwork to line the halls of courts and palaces across the world is long and hard. Starting from the quarries in the Marble Galleries, Shazstundihr, and across lesser quarries in and around the Serpentreach and Bulwar, the stone is harvested in big chunks, cut down to size, and brought down hundreds of miles from mountains to cities. In these cities, the marble is sold in various different forms: from slabs to small cuts and even full sized chunks for those who use it for large construction. Across the world, the marble harvested from any other mines pales in comparison to the ones harvested in the areas around Shazstundihr. Purely white marble, easy to carve, and easy to mine and deliver. Desired by many, controlled by us. We control the marble trade, a true monopoly on an expensive good.\n\nMarble can be found everywhere now, for cheap and for plenty. When one now visits a town in the Harpy Hills, or Brasan and Bulwar even, they will not see the weak and ugly stone of before, they will see the strong marble lining the city with art carved into it with care.\n\nThe legacy of marble has become legendary. One may even say it has become more desired than diamonds, mithril, and damestear. The greatest of sculptures and most astounding buildings seem to all now be credited to the Marble Dwarves. We shouldn’t just sell our marble, but celebrate it for what good fortune it has brought us."

 shaz_shazstundification_desc:0 "Patrolling these ancient halls, a dwarf is struck by the profound melancholy for all that was lost over millenia of dwarven stagnation and greenskin rampage. But one is also filled with pride - for all the wear of time and malice of orcs in a dozen lifetimes has not been able to sweep away the grandeur of Shazstundihr! We are the children of our Ancestors, and we can see in every stone the ancient glories and shining future of this hold. The halls will bustle, anvils will ring, and the walls will gleam once more!"
 shaz_outside_our_walls_title:0 "Outside Of Our Walls"
 shaz_outside_our_walls_desc:0 "What have goblins ever done for us? If we, the working, sweating Dwarven men of Shazstundihr promise peace, bread, and trade with all who gaze upon our gates, why is it that these wretched dirthobbit scoundrel ravage and barbarize our work? It was once said that only a being with the capability to think can differentiate a stone from a gem. If true, then the goblins only think of our marvelous work as nothing short of a trove of loot, for them alone and for no one else's. This grave insult to our ancestors, to our very own livelihood, This cannot go on for long. It must be understood that our task is to eliminate the threat of the goblin scum from our great hold, once and for all."
 shaz_great_goblin_banishment_title:0 "The Great Goblin Banishment"
 shaz_great_goblin_banishment_desc:0 "Shazstundihr has solidified its position in Bulwar by cleaning out what remains of the Goblin scourge. The clans that once ravaged the lands now either lay in their huts hidden away or have been killed. Unfortunately for us, these goblins cannot be trusted. They scheme, and surely will rise up against us eventually. To avoid the likely consequence of a goblin rebellion due to our obliviosity, it is best to remove our long-time enemies from our lands, whether they like it or not. While this may be cruel, it must be done. Integration would be impossible, our history makes it so. There is no coming to an understanding for us.\n\nThe only option now left is to purge the scourge from Bahar, as an act of cruel mercy."
 shaz_reconstruction_ryuyel_title:0 "Reconstruction of Re-Uyel"
 shaz_reconstruction_ryuyel_desc:0 "The city of Re-Uyel is a touchy subject to deal with. A republic of officers they fought for freedom against oppression, but often simply replaced it with their own. Like all other great cities it shall be built back greater than ever before, but we must decide what it shall be like. It's position as a great port could be built upon to become a hub of all of Bulwar, it's schools and reputation as a melting pot can be leveraged for a great center of learning, or its military history can be drawn upon for a great officer school. This great city shall again rise in white marble, and shall forever be a beacon of freedom in Bulwar."
 shaz_furthest_reaches_title:0 "The Furthest Reaches"
 shaz_furthest_reaches_desc:0 "Rebuilding Re’uyel as a capital for the far west of Bahar has given us a plausible claim for the surrounding regions, and as such we should consolidate our western borders. If we achieve that, the future of this land looks bright: the Crathanori merchants will trade under our flag while maintaining their beliefs, and the local elves will have their temples and houses built of a stone they have long admired. This is not one great project, but it requires as much commitment – for as part of Shazstundihr, these peoples will enjoy prosperity as they haven’t seen since the decades of devastation left their lands plundered."
 shaz_trade_title:0 "The Marble Trade"
 shaz_trade_desc:0 "While the demand for marble was not particularly high in the past, the reintroduction of this stone in high quantities to the Cannorian and Bulwari elites has increased their interest on our goods. This newfound economic growth has presented its limitations however, as our cities and ports simply cannot handle the amount of marble they need to export. One thing is certain – for now, we have to invest in infrastructure, before reaping the benefits of a trade hegemony on marble."
 shaz_in_need_of_assistance_title:0 "In Need Of Assistance?"
 shaz_in_need_of_assistance_desc:0 "Our territory has expanded greatly beyond our hold, and with that comes responsibility for the welfare of its inhabitants. The people of Bulwar have been bathed in violence and neglect for nigh on decades now, and many of those who did not perish have lost their livelihoods and homes. They cry out to us for assistance, and if we are to establish an everlasting edifice in Bulwar then we must answer them and build up their towns and cities."
 shaz_redesign_bal_ourd_title:0 "Redesigning Bal Ourd"
 shaz_redesign_bal_ourd_desc:0 "Bal Ourd is the southernmost Castanorian fort that still stands. It is placed in the crossroads between Cannor and Bulwar, and thus is a decisive point for us to hold if we are to defend from any interested Cannorians.\n\nThat is not the only reason for our interest in this fort, for at closer inspection, we see the clear inspiration from our ancestors' architecture. The fort is white and constructed of marble, with clear resemblance to early Marble Dwarf architecture. It was also recently discovered through excavation around the area, that the designer of the fort was fond of our ancestors' architecture, and had visited Shazstundihr many times before when our gates remained open. \n\nIt is our job to bring the fort’s full potential out, and to make it shine once more. If we don’t, how can we call ourselves the best builders around? Let us begin the redesigning!"

 shaz_preparation_for_expedition_title:0 "Expedition Preparations"
 shaz_preparation_for_expedition_desc:0 "Shazstundihr sits at the southern heights of the Serpentreach, having served as a point of entrance to Bulwar until its fall. As such, it was used by the goblins as a passage into the outside world. If we are to protect our new home from future invasions, we must reach Bulwar – and rid it of such squatters.\n\nWhile we are used to preparing and carrying out expeditions into hostile lands, this one will require much more effort from our part; We must seek to befriend whatever men live there, and we ought to be ready for their response."
 shaz_a_guide_into_light_title:0 "A Guide Into The Light"
 shaz_a_guide_into_light_desc:0 "We are still a long way to restoring the splendor Shazstundihr had before its fall. That did not stop, however, the first foreign delegation to cross the Marble Gate in centuries from gazing in awe at our ongoing works. Halls, tunnels and bridges all clad in white, pink and black tones of our namesake stone, all seemed to greatly relieve the guests as they entered.\n\n“We came to these halls dreading darkness”, one of the diplomats remarked, “it was not our expectation to find a place so fresh and enlightened”. So it happens that part of this hold is within the sunlight’s grasp due to marble’s reflective nature – allowing the creation of a small diplomatic facility for our light-accustomed friends.\n\nA new diplomatic facility will solidify our alliance, in addition to securing guidance for further expeditions into the lands bathed by the Sun."
 shaz_reforging_the_council_title:0 "Reforging The Council"
 shaz_reforging_the_council_desc:0 "As we continue to expand and develop, it’s becoming apparent our current methods of governance won’t suffice. Already our departments are reaching their very limits while bloat prevents the truly talented from rising above the filth that has begun to fester. If we don’t want to collapse on our own weight, then reform is a necessity. But, where to start? Thanks to our scholars, we have an idea.\n\nWhile most records of old Shazstundihr have long been destroyed, we were able to recover a small few which gave us insight on how the hold operated. One institution that came up multiple times is the ‘White Stone Council’, a chamber of government that only allowed the most skilled citizens within the hold’s domain to participate within it, where they advised the monarch in all things that fell under their field of expertise. Not long after this revelation, there has been a vast amount of support from our officials for restoring the Council, and the ruler has little reason to disagree."
 shaz_forging_peace_title:0 "Forging Peace"
 shaz_forging_peace_desc:0 "The Bulwari sun suffuses this land with light, and couldn't be more different from the caves of the Dwarovar. And under the sun, the petty squabbling of the sun elves over a lost legacy offers a poor foundation to build peace in Bulwar from. It is our duty to lay the stones that surround us and restore peace to these lands. However, we admit we are still out of place above ground, and must seek out allies to assist us in our defense. We refuse to be cast out so that elves, goblins, or anyone else can continue their fruitless games at the expense of countless lives. If attacked, we will defend the future we see!"
 shaz_integrating_elves_title:0 "Integrating The Elves"
 shaz_integrating_elves_desc:0 "Relations between the Dwarves and Elves have long been fraught, dating back millennia to a primordial conflict between our Ancestors and the Precursors of the Elves. Modern interactions have also tended toward hostility, with the new elven Sun Cult proclaiming the elves as the divine chosens of Surael, holding dominion and stewardship over the whole of Bulwar.\n\nBut the Elves of Bulwar today are not the lords of the Phoenix Empire of centuries past, and this New Sun Cult is scarcely a generation old to most Elves. Both our peoples have been humbled by internal strife and the ravages of time. It is as strangers to this land that we come to Bulwar, and it is time to put the old enmities to rest. We can make inroads, plan economic and administrative systems to benefit both our peoples, and forge a new future where strife can be settled with negotiation rather than force of arms."
 shaz_simbur_plan_title:0 "Simbûr's Plan"
 shaz_simbur_plan_desc:0 "How does one unite polar opposites?\n\nAn feat unthought of, similar to trying to connect like sides of two large magnets: the closer they get, the harder they push back. Although, just because something looks hard, doesn't mean it can't be done.\n\nSimbur, who has proven himself an advocate for peace and unity, has come to the council with his latest plan to build a bridge between the New Sun Cult and the Old Sun Cult, in an attempt to lessen the stigmas that have risen from this eternal conflict between them. We will require a large amount of support though, especially from the New Sun Cult, who are unrelenting in their beliefs of elven superiority, before we can continue forward with our mission."

 shaz_appeasing_opposers_desc:0 "There are many who doubt our intentions, they say we are conquerors ruling for wealth, they say we desecrate their faith and spit on their traditions. We must show them they are wrong. We will be better than their rulers once were, we must be in order to secure peace. By the will of Simbur there will be a reckoning in these lands, a reckoning against injustice, against poverty, and against suffering. That will prove them all wrong."

 shaz_reconstruction_azkal_uak_desc:0 "Akal Uak is a city of flat plains and woodlands surrounding various gently rolling hills, leading up to massive mountains in the distance. It became a safe haven for anyone seeking protection, since it was fairly out of the way for any type of excursion. Over the years, the city has developed a unique taste of Bahari culture, where pillars scrape the skies and buildings are round and dominated by carved domes with depictions of great kings and queens. Some are made of tile and some are made of gilded gold acquired through hardships. The architecture is very unique, to say the least. There is a need though, a need for assistance and renovation still. Much of the cities resources have been used on the conflicts of the Sun Cults. Plus, the city hasn’t seen much development in a while, despite the efforts of the civilians. It isn’t stagnating by any means, but it needs a push before the city can really take off.\n\nSo then, where shall we begin?"
 shaz_freeing_sheep_title:0 "Freeing The Sheep"
 shaz_freeing_sheep_desc:0 "The Gelkali are a people of wits. Living up in the mountains, they have managed to fight back harpy raids countless times. Nowadays, though, they find themselves under the boots of elven overlords, and have never seemed to find their place amongst the modern world. Such resilient minds have found themselves bitter at the sight of their nation being forced into the backseat.\n\nTo have the humans of Gelkalis support our movement would mean a lot. To have the support of the toughest humans in Bulwar may spark change in the rest of the humans in the land to join our cause. To get to that point first, we must of course light the fuse that will start the explosion."
 shaz_reconstruction_gelkalis_title:0 "Reconstruction Of Gelkalis"
 shaz_reconstruction_gelkalis_desc:0 "Gelkalis is a city hidden amongst the mountains, strategically positioned in an effort to protect their city from harpy raids using their environment. Thus, all around the high hills and rugged mountains, Gelkalis has an availability of caves where they hide civilians from any sort of invasion or attack upon the city. The main town of course is also very unique, with small buildings built with hard brick walls and tile roofs. The city itself is well protected, but being so high in the mountains, there are bound to be issues. Supplies are scarce, for what wealth the city has is often rationed amongst many different things. Imports come less often due to the fear of getting harassed by raids from above. While we work to clear out this issue and to secure the resources to provide the people with supplies, the best we can do to assist the people as of current is to find another outlet for the economy of the region. If Gelkalis is to prosper, then the economy needs to flourish alongside it."
 shaz_no_more_boundaries_title:0 "No More Boundaries"
 shaz_no_more_boundaries_desc:0 "It is said that peace comes at a price.\n\nGod had only given us blessings since the Triumverate of Ovdal Tûngr, Shazstundihr, and Arg-Ôrdstun made their presence known in Bulwar. For many outside our borders though, much less can be said. They have stressed and fought, terrorized and banished, all in an attempt of stoping an unstoppable force. Now though, with our lands consolidated and our borders spread wide, there have been reports of petty raids and explosions all across our border. While we would be able to deal with such acts of tyranny and cruel revenge, our armies have been stretched thin. Currently, all we can do is defend our border, lest we succumb to an invasion gone wrong. It is time to prove to the people that we truly mean what we stand for. Arm the borders, but do not fight. Secure the supplies and make sure the granaries are filled taut. Once we have managed to control the situation, then we will have our time to act.\n\nHow dare they! The so mighty and confident Aristocrats, they tempt fate, trying to bend it to its will. They pray for the day our downfall comes. We know that fate has given us the better hand. While we have given our citizens an Avalon of peace and prosperity, these elven kingdoms have done nothing but fight and skirmish, and even find the time to raise coalitions instead of helping their citizens. To fight for these citizens, these people constantly hurt due to violence and cruelty, we must be ready. Once the dust has settled and our soldiers stand prepared, we will show the world what true change looks like, a change that will leave a mark on Bulwar for ages to come!"
 shaz_faux_city_bulwar_title:0 "The Faux City Of Bulwar"
 shaz_faux_city_bulwar_desc:0 "Bulwar is a city that hasn't seen fair days for many years. Old tales tell of a Bulwar that represented the center of strong empires, and was always the center of a united Bulwari Empire, no matter the regime or race. Its recent history, though, has been marred by being subjugated by the gnolls as a small city state with no influence over the politics of the rest of the lands. Many elves could probably still recount their fathers tales of when Bulwar had importance to the land sharing its name. Now though, the city has no real power, no real meaning, even if it is the biggest city in the region. To restore the former glory of this vital city, we must break this historical cycle and be directly involved with the city on its path to renewal. There needs to be change enacted now, for surely Bulwar will fade into the background if not."

 shaz_building_bulwar_anew_desc:0 "Years ago, when our hold was still a bastion of strength and trade, our dwarven ancestors were considered some of the brightest minds in architecture. Works that inspired many famous buildings, not only in Bulwar, but across the world. It is said that even great cities like Castonath and Kheterata had Marble Dwarves working on some of the finest buildings in the city.\n\nNone stands out more than the City of Bulwar, which had its Canals, Walls, and Palaces designed by some of Shazstundihrs greatest architects. In modern times, all that was built 3000 years ago has now been built over by the Bulwari, with inspiration from the Marble Dwarves shown throughout. With the city now in our hands, we must rebuild and reimagine the city to surpass the legacy that Sindri set up for the marble hold."

We allow those who follow the New Sun Cult to keep their religion in Shazstundihr, but Irrliam could easily turn this against us, forming a coalition of the remaining Bulwari powers while also using their religious authority to foment revolt in our own lands.

Statues, buildings, and monuments are visible in every part of the country to represent not just the Marble Dwarves, but all that live inside it. People are free to practice and express themselves in any way they want. From humans, to elves, to dwarves and even harpies, they no longer have to fight pointless wars based on prejudice and race.\n\nThere is now Peace In Our Time, and Bulwar now knows how good it can be to unite together as brethren. While some still look on with disgust and hatred, they see soon enough that as servants of liberty and equality, the Kingdom Of Marble will stand steadfast against all opposition."

Ages of greatness, lost forever, like the last copy of a prized storybook thrown into a fireplace, burnt to cinders…\n\n…But, unlike there, Shazstundihr’s story doesn’t have to end.

The answer is that religion holds barely power in our kingdom outside of local beliefs. Although, we still believe people should be able to freely speak their minds, and praise whatever gods they like and whatever rules they have set. There is no removal of the New Sun Cult, just a transition into a new era.\n\nUnfortunately, some people refuse to see it as such. There are radicals who have declared our government as heretical, and that it must be abolished. Obviously, this is lucracy, but they have enough people to have sway in our kingdom.

They call themselves the gods amongst men, divine rulers of the sacred lands that their ancestors had conquered brutally alongside Jaher hundreds of years ago. They uphold their beliefs of power to the highest degree, and while they may say it is simply a practice of religion, one cannot lie that the power that comes alongside these practices must be lustfully intoxicating. They sit in their luxurious villas, where they dictate how society should be run from their comfortable abodes. The humans of the country are barred from any governmental positions, and are often forced into labor in farms run by wealthy oligarchs. There is barely any opportunity for the majority of the land, for they live under the boot of an oppressive, impossibly pious group of aristocrats.\n\nThese ideas of religious superiority will fester, and if left unchecked, could become the direct opposition to our ideas and what we have fought for. The hunger for greed and power in these elves must be abolished, whether by our hand or the next!"

If we were to control the Magi, it would help add on to our legitimacy in the public eye. Of course that would put us at odds with the Varamhari state, but the value of being able to cooperate with the Magi to restore Bulwar cannot be understated.\n\nSome of the Magi have already given us the blessing for conquest, but in return, have asked for more freedoms to their spells. There is no problem with allowing the mages more freedom, it would even help us to expand the lacking space of mages in our country. The Magi have told us that the best place to do this would be in the center of magic in the area, a place known as Ulmiš Idiqlat. There have apparently been plans already devoted to the area to begin construction on a large university that we could take advantage of. That though, would require us to control the land."

Each of the mages will engrave these spells into the floor, and into slabs of marble that shall be placed around the room. What is most necessary is courage, for the volunteers must have the courage to give up their lives momentarily. Then, as their souls are lifted up, they will merge with the spells of the powerful mages, and absorb the energy, along with the marble, as they transform into something utterly new. \n\nWhatever is born will be confused.

He was only a bit taller than your average dwarf, and used a cane to move around. Our soldiers announce that the Marble Dwarves have been reformed, and are looking for the local governors to begin diplomacy. The old man laughs, “Diplomacy, with you?

A mason’s company wants to establish a building in the outskirts of the city, and is asking for support. There has also been a request from a local architect to renovate the port, and to bring it to new heights. We can only devote our resources to one of these projects, so we must choose wisely. Do we renovate the Library, and bring in scholars and intellectuals alike? Shall we accept the petition of the masons, and expand the industry of the area?

They have declared that we are being guided by the Malevolent Dark, and that by messing with the natural order of Bulwar, we have corrupted the lands. Their forces number in the thousands and they gather more as they continue to march towards our capital.\n\nThis was never the intention of what we wanted to do. Most people where our troops have ventured have seen massive growth in their towns and cities. We have let the citizens freely express themselves as they willed.

The city now lays in peace, and to mark the end of the reconstruction, we wanted to do something special for the city, a new Marble Building. The Treasury, Palaces, and Government House all need renovation. Unfortunately, we only have enough marble for one.

 shaz_events.10.d:0 "After all of our hard work put in to develop change in a continent riddled with problems, some people are still left thinking that we are the scourge that has burned the lands and wasted the lives of many. They think, even though our motto is to stand for liberty and equality for all, that we have torn down Bulwar and have replaced it with tyranny. One part of that remains true, that we have put in the work to destroy the Bulwari identity of oppression and brutality, and to fix it with care, culture, expression, and justice. There isn’t a need for people to fight anymore, lest they bark and shout like dogs over the insignificance of who is superior and who is not.\n\nUnfortunately, dogs are restless. If you take the bone away, surely you will be bitten. That is what two brothers have done in the recently conquered Sareyand. Letters have flooded the court, telling us of a massive army led by the brothers Vaceran and Varamael, the Highlord and the Lowlord. Aristocratic kingpins who have provided cash to the Sareyandi kings at the cost of oppressive acts of cruelty to their human labor force. It is said that they may have even kept humans as slaves. Needless to say, they stand for everything we do not. What is worse is that the army has taken up base in Sareyand, and recruits more men by the day, most likely elven veterans from the Bisartansbari revolt, and other powerful aristocrats from the south. This is the largest rebellion we have faced up to now. Are we up to the task? Have we taught our men well enough? That they must stand and fight for the principles? We are not sure of that either. Our top generals even worry of a mass desertion from the less principled in our ranks.\n\nThere still remains hope though. We are strong. They are divided. If we are to prove that what we have done is right, and that these Aristocrats were merely living a lie of unneeded violence and oppression, we must win. It was Simbur who began the plan of a new Bulwar, one with promises of safety and a great future. To carry out his greatest glory, and his final wish, it is to be seen to that we make our stand against the unruly oligarchs and to raise the banner, not of Shazstundihr, but of peace across the land."

He was a royal from Azka Evran, still holding on to the idea that it is his god given right to rule. He gathered similar minded elves and even humans, and spread his word throughout the countryside. From Birsartansbar, to Re’uyel, they grabbed the like-minded nobles, who had been afflicted and deposed, and made a revolution filled with vengeance.\n\nIs this the truth behind the anger? That these people can simply not handle change? That they cannot tolerate even losing a smidget of power? We will have to come and address this soon. If we don't, they will come back again. For now though, we can relax knowing that the people are content with this new perspective on life and governance."

 shaz_events.12.t:0 "All Are Freed"
 shaz_events.12.d:0 "Peace and tranquility, one that shall last for ages and ages to come.\n\nThe leaders of the revolution, Vaceran and Varamael, were found dead in their camps after the long battle. They and a group of elitist, rather than being tried for their crimes against all races, had commited suicide in a last act of defiance. While it wasn’t the most pristine way the conflict could have ended, it marks a big turn in the history of Bulwar, one that we have worked so hard for.\n\nThe last attempt at preserving the oppressive ways that have chained Bulwar for thousands of years, has finally been broken. \n\nNo Human, Elf, or Harpy need worry about their lives being taken to racist ideology and extremist conflict. No longer will any humane race stand to be oppressed any longer. Coexistence is a guaranteed right for everyone in Shazstundihr. Everyone will be free to practice their culture and religion free of the oppressive eyes of the imposed monoculture of old. As the cities of Bulwar and the Serpentreach come to develop and expand, from the mines of Orlghelovar, and the mountains of Gelkalis, to the plains of Kumarkand, and the hills of Birsartansbar, and even further south to the loneliest towns in the deserts, all races can prosper together in the fight for unity and equality. \n\nAfter what feels like a thousand years of constant fighting for a goal that seemed ever out of reach, we have grasped it, even if just for a moment, and it felt good. What our many kings have fought for since we have stepped out of our lonely caves and out of our white hold of marble, fighting and removing the monstrous goblin clans, has now been accomplished. What general Simbur, who now rests peacefully in heaven, originally envisioned when he brought his plan to the White Stone Council has been fulfilled and surpassed. As the sun sets across the mark of decades of progress, and as everyone looks upon the moon, white as the marble that many now stand on, they can be reminded now that everyone is freed, freed from all injustices.\n\nMay the heavens bless all of Shazstundihr, till the day that the Bulwari sun of Surael sets for the final time, and the steps of marble that they stand upon hath already withered away."

Far, far older. Though the winds may surge and twist and howl, they will never batter down the mountains that stand unflinching and motionless. It is in pursuit of our ageless traditions that we have sought to restore Shazstundihr and unite the peoples of Bulwar, and it is to this Dwarven obstinancy that we appealed to in order to counter the Harpies' argument for tradition. The mountains have come, and the Harpies may join our people in prosperity. If other Bulwari nations had conquered them first, the Harpies would undoubtedly face enslavement or extinction, and our offer is exceedingly reasonable in comparison.\n\nMany Harpy Matriarchs were not convinced of our sincerity or would not abandon ideas of a Bulwar dominated by Harpies, but some saw the appeal of Shazstundihr's vision. Over months, word of the talks became common knowledge among the Harpy population, and conflict sparked between the traditionalists and those who would make common cause with us. The Matriarchs, fearing that they will lose control as more and more Harpies answer our call, now plan open rebellion to regain their independence and dislodge the influence of Shazstundihr. Fighting has already erupted within their roosts and communities, and our forces must move swiftly to put an end to it."

Narrow pathways line the city, with various different platforms that line the edges, so that the Harpies may fly off freely. \n\nThis culture shock is something we have had to get adjusted to when developing the city once more. Luckily, with a large population of knowledgeable harpies and captured dwarves and humans who have remained here for generations, we are able to add on to the city and make sure that we don’t accidentally disturb anything in the process. Lifts for transportation and mobility, sturdier platforms, and general quality of life improvements. Unfortunately, adding any big projects has been an issue, for it poses risks to our non-harpy stonemasons. Thus, we found a nearby mesa, and established a road network from there to the main city. With enough space to fit one major construction people are vying to compete for who’s idea will be turned into reality. One Harpy General has offered her soldiers and equipment to the country in return for letting her have the land. Another Harpy wants to assist her brethren in integrating into Harpy society via a school of education. Finally, a group of Harpies has asked for the plateau and the land surrounding it to be left to the Harpies as dedicated hunting grounds.

Of course, it is up to the mages to decide what to put in their areas of study, but they seem mostly divided. Some mages have a keen idea towards dedicating the space towards teaching more young mages and expanding the amount of active Magi. Some want to convert a large portion of the space into a lab, where they can experiment with the sciences and spells, but also keep the area free for storing books and spells and such. Finally, some want to dedicate the entire area to studies, and for the rest of the investments made into the university to be dedicated to fully supplying the materials needed for this project. One group incentivises a simple expansion of the University, one group asks for it all to be dedicated to a laboratory, and the group in the middle tries to seek compromise between the two.

The location was a small cave situated five miles north of Varamhar, along some rolling hills. Waiting for them there was an encampment of mages, led by one Elrico Panthocci. They chatted for hours about the supposed process, and as day became night, and the men became restless, Ungrim signed his men to begin entering the cave. \n\nNobody knew how 20,000 men would fit in this small room, but as they entered, the true size of the cave became apparent, as it stretched for miles under the surface, with magical spells embedded to the floor. Marble slabs were found all throughout the cave, and also had the same spells carved out. The room itself even felt as if it had an aura, as if it was alive. People began to feel afraid, and even more so as the cavern itself began to tremble and shake. The process was commencing, and Ungrim Grayband was heard telling his men to be brave, and have courage, before the cave itself closed in on itself. The floor trembled, and light beamed out from cracks in the floor. The dirt and sturdy stone that stood above the cave now began to crumble away.\n\nSuddenly, a large shockwave burst throughout the area, blowing dust all over the fields and hills, but that wasn’t the end of it. The dust came back in, and brought even more with it. Everything began to dive into the cave like it was a singularity, absorbing everything into the bright hole that now lay in the place of the 20,000 men. Spirits wisped and danced around as funnels formed, diving matter straight into oblivion. The cave got brighter, and brighter, almost appearing like a star. The few bystanders that remained prepared for an explosion, but it never came. The whisps began making their way back into the hole, and the light began to dim out. The process had been completed.\n\nElrico Panthocci was the first to come out, with a creature at his side. It had skin of marble, and its eyes were dark. It stumbled, and had to be assisted on its way out. Elrico spoke softly to the being, as its eyes slowly began to glow a bright green. As soon as it got a glimpse above, at the night sky, it spoke, ‘I am Ungrim Grayband, leader of the Vîhtebloth. I remember who I am. The experiment was a success.’\n\nThe rest of the mages then appeared, guiding the rest of the Vîhtebloth out of the cave. They have gone past the limits of their humanity.

Locals have petitioned for a renovation of the local city square, so they can have a communal center. This may bring in more travelers and prosperity to the city. Intellectuals have been arguing for renovations to the local university, so that they may be able to expand their studies.

But after the fall of Shazstundihr, these trade routes were severed, causing a shortage that persisted for untold years.\n\nNo longer. Our emissaries have gone from the coast of Bahar to the Divenhal sea and into the very heart of Cannor, the Dameshead, as part of a campaign of shock and awe: proclaiming that Shazstundihr is restored and the contracts of old shall be enumerated once more for the sale of marble, of which we hold the highest quantity and quality. To underscore this, the Cannorian market was flooded with dwarven marble so that the stark contrast between what we possess and what any lesser quarry carries would be obvious to all. As planned, these puny competitors perished conspicuously in our stony onslaught and we have become the sole suppliers of marble in the greatest market of the human world. Now we taper off our supply to further drive the Cannorians into a frenzy, and their envoys fall over themselves to secure precious contracts with us."

With this influx of trade going in and out of the city, we find ourselves overwhelmed attempting to keep everything in order. To make sure that we are able to keep up and sustain the trade of Brasan, the White Stone Council has decided to renovate the city to increase its capacity. As the infrastructure is expanded to even greater heights, a plan on how to make sure we can control the reigns of the Divenhal is still being decided. Three plans stand out as unique and most likely to succeed. Two involve rehaulting the port completely, which would take some time, but would end up allowing us to increase our capacity. The traders of our nation are split on whether to dedicate the new areas to be added to the port for ships or for markets. Another proposition has been made by foreign investors to construct an exchange in Brasan, where people would be free to invest their ducats into whatever they felt like, and where they could store their money as well. Brasan could use for all three of these buildings, but local resources are limited and workers are expensive, thus we only have time for one. The course of our trade across the Divenhal may be decided here."

They... used them as clubs.\n\nAncient Marble Dwarven records detailing contracts with other Dwarven holds and Bulwari nations; extensive damage to the bindings, folded and creased corners, and numerous pages torn or entirely removed from the books. These documents were found next to a Clanboss's latrine, presumably for ease of access.\n\nA large marble sculpture of a muscular dwarven warrior: the head has been removed entirely and the beard chiseled off, replaced with a crude clay rendition of a Goblin head. With these alterations, the sculpture is now a Goblin with comically large muscles. The original artist's signature beneath the base has been defaced and is unreadable."

Sculptures and engravings were carved into the walls themselves, adding beauty to the building. Yet still, the walls are now sturdier, and have been hardened for battle.

Civilians from Ourdia, Dostanor, and Bahar come to watch the construction lead by the ruler of Shazstundihr himself.\n\nAfter all was said and done, the true vision of Bal Ourd was found. A patio with engravings written in Castanorian, Dwarven, and Bulwari, stating, “Peace over security.” Statues surround the marble floor, depicting the heroes of Anbennar and Bulwar, all in vicious detail. At the edge of the marble floor, facing the ocean, lay a remade Dove Throne, symbolizing unity between the two regions of Halann. [Root.Monarch.GetName] declares that Bal Ourd should no longer stand for conflict, just to be used and destroyed over and over again. For as long as Shazstundihr is to stand, and for as long as this peace is to last, Bal Ourd shall be free to pass by civilians and lords alike.\n\nCannorians and Bulwari stand closer together than ever before."

 shaz_events.24.d:0 "In ancient times, the Marble Gate served two purposes. First, it would be closed to defend the Dwarves from intruders. Second, its engravings exhibited the artistry of Shazstundihr's stoneworkers, and was emblematic of the marble hold and its trade. But in our time, both of these purposes are lost. After we stepped beyond its threshold and built peace in Bulwar, there are no longer any intruders to repel and many Dwarves spend much time on the surface among our new citizens. When we considered how to restore the Marble Gate, we realized that it must embody a new purpose to reflect the changes we have wrought.\n\nA sea of onlookers watched over many days as the ruin of the gate was methodically repaired, with thick marble plates covering the worn and damaged exterior and the frame itself being entirely replaced. Once complete, the two doors of the gate were closed, and the great work began. The masons began engraving on both sides, but those outside the gates could only see what occurred from their side. Massive linear dwarven runic patterns were engraved on the outside face of the gates. But one day, the Dwarves stopped their carving while the doors overall seemed quite bare, and the onlookers were puzzled at first. Surely the restoration of the Marble Gate could not be completed so quickly and so simply by the skilled Dwarves? These murmurs were silenced when people closer to the gate shouted that they could still hear hammering and chiseling. The work was continuing from the inside.\n\nAfter weeks, the crowd's patience was at last rewarded. Grinding stone reverberated out as the colossal doors slowly opened, and all stood under the bright white shadow of the Marble Gates. The insides of the gate doors had been expertly engraved with scenes from throughout four thousand years of Bulwari history: the genies and the God-kings; the rise of the Sun Cult; the establishment of the Bulwari Accord; the Akalšesi Renaissance, the landing of Jaher; and crowned with the refounding of Shazstundihr. More than just a monument to Shazstundihr or Bulwar, it was clear to all that the Marble Gate glorifies civilization itself, in all its successes and struggles. The future is built over the past, and in Shazstundihr we have erected an eternal marble foundation that all posterity will be constructed on. We looked to those who came before, and now we shall lead and inspire those who come after, with gates perpetually open."

For years now, the city of Bulwar has been under the rule of a small city state, subject to obedience by the gnolls and elves. Before that though, its legacy was great, as the capital for many great empires. They all have left their mark in the cities architecture, with their extravagant art and gilded walls. Much of what they have learned though, originated from our hold, and our famed architects. \n\nNow that the hold is in our hands, it is time for us to leave our mark on the city, and certify to our people that we rule not for conquest, but for all that is serene and harmonious. This building shall come to represent to our people, their kin, and the rest of their descendants, the legacy that our hold left on Bulwar. If we want something big, grandiose, and history making, three things come to mind. The Walls Of Bulwar could represent a legacy of protection, and safety for our people. The Canals of Bulwar could tell a story of agriculture, production, and good harvest. The Palaces of Bulwar could come to show a kingdom of great rulers, and prosperity for our kingdom.\n\nHow can the legacy of a kingdom be decided by buildings? It cannot always be. Some kingdoms' legacies are decided by the blood and battle they have shed. Others have had them decided by the amount of land conquered into their kingdoms. Only a few ever have their kingdoms decided by the peace they bring, and the culture and art that comes from. Fewer have something to show for it, with their era being lost to times of death and war. Shazstundihr though, its buildings shall stand high. This is much bigger than the small buildings we’ve built throughout the lands for harpies, elves, and humans alike. This is us, the people, united under one common banner. We must be wise, and think long and hard, for when the day is over, we begin."

When we first met you were simply a noble, but as we talked, I realized our ideologies, ideas, and will proved to be all too alike. You are an idealist, and that is worth well enough praise on its own. It wasn’t just that though. Thanks to you, we managed to save tens of thousands of people from oppression and gave them a chance at a free life. \n\nWhile I spent my younger days slaughtering hordes of goblins and orcs, I came to learn as I grew ever older that even they are worthy of respect and honor in their own right.

You are an inspiration to all, and I am thankful to have served alongside you.\n\nAs my final wish, I grant you my family title, of which you have done nothing but embody and become a true exemplar of.

One group has been fond of an ancestral temple on the outskirts of the city, which supposedly has ties to many families across Bulwar, and possibly even further. Another group has asked for the temple of Surakel to be refurbished in the city square, so that people may come and pray to their lord as they please without having to deal with rundown infrastructure.

This is why the White Stone Council decided that investment was necessary for continued success in the region. The city was made more accessible by road, and its buildings and monuments refurbished. Finally, to leave our mark in the city, we decided to begin plans on a new building located nearby the city of Gelkalis. We purchased a large plot of land, and began hearing out ideas for what should be placed there. Many of the locals have asked for the lands to become dedicated farmlands, and for the infrastructure around it to be repurposed as barnyards and farms. A dwarven general suggest we take advantage of the position of Gelkalis and to turn the area into a mountain fortress, impenetrable to all forms of attack.

This is a question that seems to have no clear answer, for when a kingdom tries to bring about an era of peace, it always seems like their neighbors attack like savage dogs, ripping their lands to shreds and continuing this perpetual cycle of war and conquest. The anomaly though, is clear. We have given the people arable land, safe housing, and a shield to protect them from the terrors that lay along our border. The lands we have restored from the goblins, elven aristocrats, and crazed religious radicals, have welcomed prosperity never before heard of. The people now live alongside each other, elven or human, and even harpy. Outside of our borders though? They bicker like animals. \n\nHow can peace in our time be achieved? The legacy that the Phoenix Empire has left upon Bulwar has been a detriment to all people, of all cultures, in and out of Bulwar. It seeps across the land, guiding people into chaos.

Of course, a portion of this will be collected by the government, but most of the profits will be put back into the city, and even stored for the next festival.\n\nWith the first day rounding to a close, the night sky makes way for torches on the street and for a collection of very wealthy royalty to cruise around the streets and to march towards the capitol building, where the ruler of Shazstundihr usually resides to oversee festivities. Within the coming days, the festival will come to a gigantic close with the biggest and finest piece of marble to be sold to the chosen buyer at a ludicrous price.

Notable for being famous advisors to the mayors of Beepeck and Emperors of Anbennar, they plan to use the piece to show the scriptures and rules that their family lives by, and their keys to success as a constant reminder of their heritage.

Of course this may be true, it can never be so clear with how much history has been rewritten or lost completely, but to tie these historical figures with their own family was still perceived as ludicrous.\n\nAfter hours and hours of trying to convince the slightly upset sun elves in the crowd, they eventually just left, and took the marble with them.\n\nNeedless to say, many of the humans, dwarves, harpies, gnolls, and even elves themselves got a good laugh out of the síl Haven’s lunacy."

 shaz_events.38.t:0 "Harpies Settling Down"
 shaz_events.38.d:0 "As the times of protest and infighting between harpy communities slowly come to a close, and rebels slowly start to calm down, more and more harpies begin the process of integrating themselves into Marble Dwarf society. While there has been some resistance, due to the long standing precedent of harpies being nothing more than monsters, many have made sure to assist the harpies, and to help them with finding their own path in our nation. Not only is this a great victory for us and our harpy friends, but the fact that people are willing to help a group that has been seen as savage monsters for centuries, and support them in their cause? This tells us that our ideas have spread.\n\nPeople are finally starting to understand what it means to stand for the ideas of equality!"
 shaz_events.38.a:0 "Oh yeah, its all coming together."
 shaz_events.39.t:0 "Marble And Copper, Making It Work"
 shaz_events.39.d:0 "Ovdal Tûngr is a nation with plenty of history with the hold of Shazstundihr. They started off as acquaintances, often trading. Then the rulers of Ovdal Tûngr assisted with an invasion of our hold, which our ancestors managed to defend. Since that point, Marble and Copper dwarves have been bitter, and don’t ever seem to see eye to eye on anything.\n\nAt least that was what was told in history books. In reality, when the two leaders sat down and enjoyed a meal together, they agreed on many things. Most important to the two, was the future of their nations in an environment seemingly inhospitable for small nations that were counting on peace, especially with all the goblins around and elves attempting to claim a lost hill. There was a need to stand united during these times of turmoil. Thus, when [Root.Monarch.GetName] had met with the leader of the copper dwarves once more, the idea of these shared prospects of fighting for peace and unity brought up the posibility of becoming united as one. Unlike with what happened with Arg-Ôrdstun, the prideful posse that they were, the Copper Dwarves had already shown signs of wanting to increase ties even further.\n\nThe plan would put Shazstundihr at the head, since they had access to the riches of the Dwarovar and as the rising star of the two, and Ovdal Tûngr as a co-partner. Together with the now passive hold of Arg-Ôrdstun, the three holds would look out as a union of nations to assure the safety of the wants of the three nations.\n\nThe question that lay ahead of us now, is should we go ahead with this plan?"
 shaz_events.39.a:0 "Let us move foward, together"
 shaz_events.39.b:0 "Let us move ahead, as just friends."
