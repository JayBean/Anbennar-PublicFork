 oinukhudi.1.t:0 "A Slothful Decline"
 oinukhudi.1.d:0 "The Oinukhudi Cheqh'anate has long dominated the northern fringes of Haless, dutifully manning the Iron Gates to defend its homeland from centaur incursions, ceaselessly battling the Shuvüüshudi terror riders along its southern flank, and often taking up torch and stave to drive off the loathsome face-stealing spirits of Khaashalg. Life is not easy, but the forest is our home, our own Gerinoinu.\n\nBut as sure as the autumn leaves fall, time passes and life is molded by fate like clay into something wholly new. Time has not been kind to the Cheqh'anate, with civil war and tensions arising between the nomadic Oinukhudi people and the sedentary Anarkhudi--all this ignoring the abrasions that the Hill Trolls cause in the taishi structure. With the ascension of Ugetchi to the mantle of the Five Phases, this state of affairs has only grown more dire. The Cheqh'an has not embarked upon his yearly Ursdayalal in decades, leaving the countryside to the whims of the many taishi bannerlords, who have grown in power in the Cheqh'an's absence.\n\nThe current state of affairs is stable. Ugetchi's neglect has resulted in a strong sense of self-governance, reducing the duties of the government and, in a way, appeasing his subjects. However, should Ugetchi continue to refuse his duties and not embark upon a new Ursdayalal, the realm may very well fracture into chaos."
 oinukhudi.1.a:0 "The path forward will not be easy."

 oinukhudi.2.t:0 "Taishi Appointment"
 oinukhudi.2.d:0 "It is the duty of the Cheqh'an to appoint new taishi bannerlords once per ten years when winter turns to spring. Typically, the Cheqh'an makes these appointments during the yearly Ursdayalal in the land that these taishi would govern, however times have changed and the Cheqh'an now presides in the capital. The appointment ceremony has become nothing more than a formality, with taishi selecting their sons to inherit their titles without any interference from the Cheqh'an.\n\nThe time has come to make these appointments. Will the Cheqh'an finally make the journey south to appoint new frontier taishi?"
 oinukhudi.2.a:0 "We'll make the journey; make sure to bring enough kumis to last."
 oinukhudi.2.b:0 "Why make the trip when they can come to us?"

 oinukhudi.3.t:0 "A Rather Large Candidate"
 oinukhudi.3.d1:0 "Along the path of the Ursdayalal, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] greeted by a rather stout Hill Troll adorned in a bronze war mask, which is among the highest honors that a Hill Troll can be bestowed. Assuming the troll wished to join the Sasarai Tasuzidavi, [Root.Monarch.GetName] offered him a seat and began questioning him regarding his closeness to the earth spirits, among other minor queries. The Hill Troll let out a bellowing laugh, and clarified that he had not arrived to serve as a guard, but rather as a taishi."
 oinukhudi.3.d2:0 "Lounging about [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] halls, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] greeted by a rather stout Hill Troll adorned in a bronze war mask, which is among the highest honors that a Hill Troll can be bestowed. Assuming the troll wished to join the Sasarai Tasuzidavi, [Root.Monarch.GetName] offered him a seat and began questioning him regarding his closeness to the earth spirits, among other minor queries. The Hill Troll let out a bellowing laugh, and clarified that he had not arrived to serve as a guard, but rather as a taishi.\n\nThe role of taishi is not one typically bestowed to the Oinukhudi's earthen brethren, though exceptions have been made in the past at the demands of influential Bö."
 oinukhudi.3.a:0 ""Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.""
 oinukhudi.3.b:0 ""All have their lot in life. Yours is not here.""

 oinukhudi.10.t:0 "The Talda'Khudi"
 oinukhudi.10.d:0 "[GetYear] winters after the Day the Sky Rebelled, tensions have reached their breaking point. Strained by decades of indignant sloth and drunkness, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s efforts to make things right have come far, far too late.\n\nThe Hill Trolls have flocked under the banner of their ancient rallying cry, "Samisalik Bolki," or "The Last Kingdom." They have claimed stewardship of the legacy of the Hill Giants of days long passed, casting aside Khudi rule in favor of the ancient mantle of Giantkind.\n\nTo the west, the Anarkhudi, who have long since benefitted from our protection, have declared independence, founding the Free Kingdom of Anarkhudi Peoples. Though they possess much arable land, the Anarkhudi lack the strength and fortitude of the Cheqh'an needed to defend against the endless centaur hordes of the Far West. Even if we fail to rein the Anarkhudi in, they will succumb to attrition soon enough."
 oinukhudi.10.a:0 "For the Cheqh'an!"
 oinukhudi.10.b:0 "The time of nomads has ended!"
 oinukhudi.10.c:0 "We must rally to the plight of all Giantkind!"

 oinukhudi.11.t:0 "The Eye of the Storm"
 oinukhudi.11.d:0 "§GYou've reached the end of the placeholder Oinukhudi gameplay. I'm working on finishing these lads, but it may take some time :) -ele§!"
 oinukhudi.11.a:0 "Now go conquer Haless like you were born to."

 V01_benign_neglect_desc:0 "The delicate balance of taishi and Cheqh'an has historically been maintained through regular shows of force. However, Ugetchi of the Five Phases has long since neglected his duties, allowing the taishi bannerlords to do as they please along the countryside. Though the Cheqh'an's influence suffers greatly due to this, an autonomous taishi is a contented taishi."
