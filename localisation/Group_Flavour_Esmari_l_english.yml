 flavor_esmari.2.t:0 "Tragic Death at Party"

 flavor_esmari.7.t:0 "Party Damages Capital"

 flavor_esmari.8.t:0 "Heroic Ruler"
 flavor_esmari.8.d:0 "Disaster was imminent. The boats were reaching the harbor at great speed.

 flavor_esmari.11.t:0 "Outrage at Party"
 flavor_esmari.11.d:0 "The next morning, some of our soldiers woke up with pools of blood next to them, meanwhile other soldiers did not. The details are unclear, but the fact remains that one of our neighbours is going to be upset."

 flavor_esmari.12.t:0 "Good Company"
 flavor_esmari.12.d:0 "The main reason why people attend these parties is for having a distraction from work and other unpleasant or fatiguing things. Many friendships are made on these boats, just like the one between several of our officials and those of our neighbour."

 flavor_esmari.18.t:0 "Vassals Annoyed at Boat Party"
 flavor_esmari.18.d:0 "Maybe it was the fact that the liquer was of poor quality. Maybe it was the fistfight. Or the fact that many vomited on the vassals. They did not like the party either way."

 flavor_esmari.19.t:0 "Vassals Really Like Boat Parties"

 flavor_esmari.20.t:0 "Vassals Don't Like Boat Parties"

 flavor_esmari.22.t:0 "Traders Encounter"
 flavor_esmari.22.d:0 "Apparently, meeting in their guildhall and markets wasn't enough for the traders of the region, so they met up on the boats to scheme again. Luckily, it will be to our benefit as well."

 flavor_esmari.28.t:0 "A Military Genius"
 flavor_esmari.28.d:0 "For some reason, some officer brought on board a chessboard. Many just passed by him, preferring beer, but some, especially our officers and generals, accepted his challenge.

 flavor_esmari.28.a:0 "Will you accept to serve?"
 flavor_esmari.29.t:0 "The Captain of the Boat"
 flavor_esmari.29.d:0 "It's hard to miss how closely the boat nearly misses shallows and rocks. The one commanding the ship must be of rare quality."

 flavor_esmari.30.t:0 "A Renowned Seafarer"
 flavor_esmari.30.d:0 "You notice a huge crowd has formed. A man is at the center of it, telling stories of faraway lands. As several sailors confirm, he must be one of the greatest wayfarers in the world."

 flavor_esmari.33.t:0 "Boat Full of Smiths Sinks"
 flavor_esmari.33.d:0 "Apparently, a bunch of muscular drunken men who know nothing of seafaring should not be grouped in one single boat."

 flavor_esmari.36.a:0 "Damnation!"
 flavor_esmari.37.t:0 "General Found Dead"
 flavor_esmari.37.d:0 "He was found by a group of fishermen with their net. On his body, no wounds were found. He may have accidentally throw himself out of the boat while drunk. We'll never know for sure."
