 F69_contesting_the_seas_title:0 "Contesting the Seas"
 F69_contesting_the_seas_desc:0 "The beaches of Akasik are littered with driftwood, most of it from ships that fell victim to the Seascourge Gnolls. When Viakkoc took the gate to the Divenhal, they gained the power to pirate and plunder all across her seas. Leave the Dameshead Sea, venture beyond the Pearls, and you were never far from the Gnolly Roger of Viakkoc. To control Akasik, we must control the seas."

 F69_slaying_the_scourge_title:0 "Slaying the Scourge"
 F69_slaying_the_scourge_desc:0 "Of all the gnolls who attempted the heinous rituals of the Xhazobkult after the Twin Xhazobine, Viakkoc the Mighty is perhaps the most infamous. Her pirates ransacked ports across the Divenhal, turning the seas red as the blood of their victims flowed off the decks of their ships. Such waste, such brutality, and such pointless sacrifice, and for what? What did Viakkoc truly achieve? Ruling over a small pack of pirates in a distant corner of this vast Salahad? It’s no wonder the Kult is dying while the hammer of Kvangagha grows.\n\nTerminate the teachings of the Xhazobkult in Akasik. Condemn the remnants of Viakkoc to nothing but ash, then spread that ash across the fields. Because we are followers of Kvangagha and we wouldn’t let such valuable fertilizing material go to waste. "

 F69_continue_the_cleansing_title:0 "Continue the Cleansing"
 F69_continue_the_cleansing_desc:0 "You can learn a lot about the two primary faiths of the gnollish populace from how they view humans. While both religions were intended exclusively for gnolls, Kvangagha allows for any non-gnoll to be recognised by the faith through the Trial of the Reforged Chain. Show you understand the importance of repurposing discarded materials through a piece of great craftsmanship, and you become an honorary member of the faith. Humans in the Kult meanwhile are considered to be little more than krah; slaves to be worked until they can work no more, and then ritually sacrificed in the vain hope you might attract the attention of the demons.\n\nA human - even those who worship the strange cat-headed beings along the Sorrow - has a lot more value to us than just serving as krah. They too should understand the preferable position as humans under us than under another, less tolerant faith."

 F69_cleaving_the_mountains_title:0 "Cleaving the Mountains"
 F69_cleaving_the_mountains_desc:0 "As the Sandfang gnolls spilled into Bulwar, they brought with them that most destructive of faiths. The blood of their captives, human and elf alike, drained into the sands of the Salahad, befouling the tunnels that crisscross under the sandstone. Soon it shall be their blood that flows under the sands. The Salahad is ours, and we cannot allow Cult nor Kult to stand in our way."

 F69_rebuild_the_ashes_title:0 "Rebuild the Ashes"
 F69_rebuild_the_ashes_desc:0 "The far Salahad is the birthplace of many a heretic. The temple of Akza-Sur stands as a monument to this strange cultish religion the humans of Bulwar follow. Others are instead manic followers of The Jadd. Even the Xhazobkult has spread here, most recently through Zokka, who dreamed of becoming the next Xhazobain. Zokka once claimed he would devour the sun and place the Far Salahad into an era of darkness, and in doing so tore this part of the Salahad to pieces.\n\nDo as Kvangagha gnolls do everywhere. We take the broken and rebuild, creating something greater than before. Even if we have to break it ourselves, what we rebuild will be greater than anything that came before."

 F69_the_sand_road_title:0 "The Sand Road"
 F69_the_sand_road_desc:0 "The closest any one nation got to controlling the Salahad as we once did was the Phoenix Empire. A multi-continent empire ruled by elves, one of their finest accomplishments was the Golden Highway: a great road that went from Brasan to distant Tianlou. Its purpose was to resupply the Phoenix Legion, but it doubled as an incredible resource for traders braving the desert.\n\nEven the Golden Highway pales in comparison to what we have accomplished though. The sands part for our caravans as we profit from the riches of the desert. Yet we can still learn from the history of the Golden Highway. A big part of its success was the safety the merchants felt along its path. We can still grow our trade presence in these regions and support our merchants to truly get everything we can from our control of the Salahad."

 F69_the_route_of_approach_title:0 "The Route of Approach"
 F69_the_route_of_approach_desc:0 "A member of the Vog Mekza, while conducting research on the Sand Demon’s whereabouts, did successfully locate it. We would ask them about the dragon’s location, but unfortunately the holy mystic was turned into lunch by the great creature. Still, we do know where he went missing. Deep in the far Salahad in the province of Ardulib, a rather remote part of the region.\n\nWe don’t have time to waste. The Sand Demon could have moved on. Move our itinerant court to the far Salahad and build up a base of operations from which we can conduct further research. We will need markets to bring in food for the court, as well as a military base to defend our court in this distant corner of our empire. If we truly care about finding the Sand Demon again, we cannot delay this any further."

 F69_rally_the_nomads_title:0 "Rally the Nomads"
 F69_rally_the_nomads_desc:0 "Irkorzik’s rise to power was extremely fast, helped immensely by the backing of the shamans. Yet not all the Windhowler tribes fully support her. Many of the individual pack leaders have not even seen her nor heard her speak to understand how she gained the support she garnered so rapidly. Rally the nomads, convince them of her leadership, and with them on our side, we can begin consolidating our precarious position."

 F69_organize_the_vog_mekza_title:0 "Organize the Vog Mekza"
 F69_organize_the_vog_mekza_desc:0 "Our people have always been guided by the Vog Mekza. The Carrion Shepherds have guided gnolls of the Western Salahad since time immemorial. They are our rudder in these sands, without whom we would be naught but food for the Sand Demon. It’s time to formalize their position among our pack to take full advantage of their powers."

 F69_ending_the_rivalry_title:0 "Ending the Rivalry"
 F69_ending_the_rivalry_desc:0 "A pack leader is everything to gnolls. It is their strength and charisma behind which the greatest gnoll packs of the past gathered. The Xhazobines are naturally the most famous, but Kvangahga gnolls too have their history of great pack leaders, for whom countless would lay down their lives in support of.\n\nBrrtekuh should not have been one of these. She led her pack of Windhowler Gnolls on a suicide mission into Akasik, leaving her crippled and her pack subjugated by Kheterata. They kept following her even after she lost her mental capabilities. We need to save our fellow Windhowler Gnolls, because bad leadership will eventually lead to the Kheteratan humans exacting revenge for what the gnolls did to their precious kingdom."

 F69_a_golden_opportunity_title:0 "A Golden Opportunity"
 F69_a_golden_opportunity_desc:0 "Decades of decay has weakened the old human kingdom of Kheterata considerably. Civil war, internal religious strife, and losing land to the Sun Elves and the Sorrowclaw Gnolls has left them frail. If we want to take the fertile floodplains of the Sorrow, we need to strike now. If history has taught us anything, it is that the Kingdom of the Sorrow is remarkably resilient and will soon recover in some form if we don’t make our move."

 F69_ruins_for_the_desert_title:0 "Ruins for the Desert"
 F69_ruins_for_the_desert_desc:0 "The humans of Kheterata have called us gnolls demons, born from the unholy merging of demonic powers with hyenas. The Xhazobkultist gnolls have taken this comparison quite literally. We are no kultists, yet we still find the term endearing. For us, it brings to mind the true owner of the Salahad. The great dragon known only as the Sand Demon. If we are to be like demons, then let us take on this dragon’s form. Swimming through the sands as though they were the calm seas of the Divenhal, controlling the sandstorms as our will demands it.\n\nThe Sand Demon of the Salahad has no barrier that can stop its passage through these sands. The Kheteratans try to claim that their feeble river of sorrow alone protects them. They say their god Elikhet, locked away in his pyramid, protects them. Let us show them how wrong they are. We demons of the Salahad cannot be stopped. The desert cannot be contained."

 F69_bulwars_gate_title:0 "Bulwar's Gate"
 F69_bulwars_gate_desc:0 "To make every corner of the Salahad ours, we must start our conquest of Bulwar. Many a conquest of Bulwar has been halted at this very point, aptly dubbed The Salahad Gate. We must start moving our military to this bay where the Divenhal meets the Salahad to prepare for the invasion. With proper preparation, we shall not falter like many did before us."

 F69_controlling_irsmahap_title:0 "Controlling Irsmahap"
 F69_controlling_irsmahap_desc:0 "When Grizaka united the Sorrowclaw Gnolls and invaded Kheterata, one of the first things she did was subjugate the humans of the Irsmahapan Plains. Their long history fighting against the gnolls has made them frightening enemies of our kind. Her goal was to put them to work fighting for her, as turning your most fearsome opponent into your fiercest fighter is an excellent tactic in any field. As the old Windhowler saying goes, do not fight the sands if you can control where they shift."

 F69_empress_of_dust_title:0 "Empress-of-Dust"
 F69_empress_of_dust_desc:0 "When the Twin Xhazobine barrelled through Gol, she upended centuries of religious customs as gnolls saw the potential power of a demon-fuelled battalion. Ever since, other gnolls have risen to claim the title as leader of the gnolls, last of the Xhazobines. The Sorrowclaw Gnolls followed Grizaka, who dubbed herself Empress-of-All-Gnolls, the latest in a long line of pretenders claiming their goal was to rule all gnolls. Return these wayward heretics under our control. Return them to the way of Kvanga."

 F69_the_final_push_title:0 "The Final Push"
 F69_the_final_push_desc:0 "If we claim to be masters of the Salahad, we must own it all. Every last grain of sand must belong to us. Then, and only then, can we even begin to claim we control this vast and wondrous desert."

 F69_the_locals_help_title:0 "The Local's Help"
 F69_the_locals_help_desc:0 "Wildhowler Gnolls are not the only residents of the Salahad, who have seen the Sand Demon and have legends detailing its exploits. The Mašnsih desert humans have legends stretching back long before even Aakhet fell afoul of the sandscale dragon. Their knowledge is far more detailed than anything the scrolls in Koroshesh told us - perhaps indicating the relative lack of interest the rest of Sarhal had in what knowledge these remote human tribes had to offer.\n\nIn the Mašnsih, we see a kindred spirit; one who too understands that the Salahad is not something to be feared, but our harsh yet tameable home. With their help, we will find the Sand Demon of the Salahad, at which point we will… well, we haven’t thought that far ahead yet, but at the very least we will endeavour not to reach the same end as Aakhet did."

 F69_the_greatest_offering_title:0 "The Greatest Offering"
 F69_the_greatest_offering_desc:0 "We found it! The Sand Demon’s lair. Or more accurately, we know where we can stand to be directly above it, as it lies deep below the Salahad. We also know the best way to summon it, and we have the bronze dragon’s folly to thank for it. The rhythmic marches of an army can cause the dunes to sing in a way that reverberates under the sands and through the tunnels below, as it did when Aakhet marched his forces towards Rahen.\n\nWe also know what it is the Sand Demon craves, for it is what all dragons crave: treasure. Gold, gems, and other fine trinkets. There is likely a horde beneath the Salahad that would make the dwarves green with envy. We dare not venture into the tunnels under the Salahad to loot this treasure. Beneath is the Sand Demon’s domain. All we ask of it is to allow us to rule the surface."

 F69_expelling_the_kult_title:0 "Expelling the Kult"
 F69_expelling_the_kult_desc:0 "When Irkorzik took control of the Windhowler Gnolls of the Salahad, one of her first acts once she had the Vog Mekza on her side was to rid the nation of the Xhazobkult. The gnolls of Western Sarhal used to follow either Kvangahga, or follow the Fangaulan Pantheon of the humans. That is, until the twin Xhazobine barreled through and ruined everything. We must stamp out these devil worshiping practices from our land if we ever want to have stability."

 F69_the_western_traitors_title:0 "The Western Traitors"
 F69_the_western_traitors_desc:0 "When Viakkoc the Mighty’s pack split, the planetouched gnoll Oxyl took those on the southern side of the Salahad and used his great powers of wind to defeat the armies of Binwarji. It is a shame that he did not join on the side of Irkorzik, for his powers would have been of much interest in our goal to control the sandstorms of the Salahad.\n\nWe do not live in that future. Instead the gnolls of Western Sarhal continue to follow the practices of the Kult, and their ruler was last seen proclaiming to be the reincarnation of a genie, even dressing as one, with suitably ridiculous curly-pointed shoes to match. End their farce now, and bring them back under the hammer of Kvangahga."

 F69_support_from_the_mystics_title:0 "Support from the Mystics"
 F69_support_from_the_mystics_desc:0 "Our nation was held together by the will of Irkorzik alone. While this is somewhat normal for gnollish packs, it is no way to run a modern nation as we wish to become. Our nation, bearing the name of Irkorzik, will be one of faith. By the hammer of Kvangha we shall rebuild the Salahad in our vision."

 F69_devising_the_trials_title:0 "Devising the Trials"
 F69_devising_the_trials_desc:0 "The good news: The mystics are on our side. They believe in the vision of a united Salahad under our hammer.\n\nThe bad news: Mystics have never before had to think about the practicality of running a nation rather than merely a migratory gnoll pack.\n\nThe top question is how does one choose a new ruler. The answer they have come to is the ruler must emulate what Irkorzik herself accomplished in her trek through the Salahad. If they can pass the same trials Irkorzik once did, then they must surely be capable of ruling our nation as she once did."

 F69_dunesworn_council_title:0 "Dunesworn Council"
 F69_dunesworn_council_desc:0 "After what seemed like years of debates and fights, with at least one sandstorm summoned midway through a session over disagreements over trials, all matters have been settled. The greatest debates came over the nature of the trials themselves, and fear over abandoning our desert migratory roots. The latter was solved by agreeing to have a migratory council, ready to move across the sands at a moment’s notice, conducting business wherever the council is needed most.\n\nFor the trials, there were concerns over whether they were too light. Suffice to say the final challenges are suitably harrowing. If one wishes to rule, first they must tackle this vast desert, survive in its harsh landscape, and only if they return will they be worthy to lead. Many who attempt these trials will perish, left only as bleached bones to be swallowed by the Sand Demon. But we know those who do return will have the resolve to lead us."

 F69_harnessing_the_desert_title:0 "Harnessing the Desert"
 F69_harnessing_the_desert_desc:0 "Other races fear the desert. Humans huddle by their river. Halflings hug their islands. Even other gnolls do not make full use of its bounty. They see it as an enemy to be defeated, not an ally. We, and we alone, know how to tame the Salahad.\n\nOr, at least, that is our dream. The Vog Mezka, inspired by the Sand Demon, have sought new ways we could control these sands. The billowing sandstorms blown up by the dragon have given us ideas. Our mages have started moving deeper into the desert to conduct experiments."

 F69_warfare_applications_title:0 "Warfare Applications"
 F69_warfare_applications_desc:0 "The sandstorms have been more successful than we could possibly have imagined. We can cloak our cities in sand that batters and blinds any army that approaches it. However, its use is limited to city defense. Right now the sandstorms require a rotating cavalcade of mages to maintain, along with a central elevated position to project the magical power out from.\n\nOur military believes this magical technology could have much broader applications. It would require the central magic crystal from which the sandstorm is powered to be transportable so it could be affixed to a sand skimmer for easier traversal across the Salahad. It wouldn’t be at the same size and ferocity as the sandstorms that guard our cities, but the generals are already dreaming of the applications of a readily deployable sandstorm."

 F69_fangaulan_secrets_title:0 "Fangaulan Secrets"
 F69_fangaulan_secrets_desc:0 "The Fangaulan people have long stopped being our enemy. Many within the Vog Mekza still consider those dwelling in the jungles to be backwards humans with whom our only interaction is to quash dissent. We need to stop with this line of thinking. They are our subjects. We must allow them to flourish under our rule, especially when we consider the wealth of institutional knowledge that lies within the many great Fangaulan cities."

 F69_culling_the_darkness_title:0 "Culling the Darkness"
 F69_culling_the_darkness_desc:0 "As our mystics dig through ancient records in the Library of Koroshesh, hunting for information on the Sand Demon, something else worrying has come to our attention. The Shadowswamp is spreading! Old maps show the uninhabitable region south of Lake Nirakhet to be much smaller, and present maps have made note of its growing presence. It even appears to be accelerating, and someday it will reach the Salahad. We absolutely cannot allow this to happen."

 F69_shutting_the_entrance_title:0 "Shutting the Entrance"
 F69_shutting_the_entrance_desc:0 "Deep within the accursed Shadowswamp stands a tree so twisted and decrepit that its toxic influence corrupts the lands and creatures around it. Where the sands of the Salahad shine bright as the sun radiates off their surface, the very color of life itself dies under the shade of that swamp. We must contain it now. Shut the entrance, lest its festering waters creep further towards the Salahad."

 F69_masters_of_the_salahad_title:0 "Masters of the Salahad"
 F69_masters_of_the_salahad_desc:0 "From Ekha to Davharral, the desert is ours. Irkorzik and the Salahad are one. Where we tell the dunes to move, they shift as we command. When our merchants skim across its sands, we know it’s with the blessing of the Sand Demon swimming below. As a blacksmith uses their hammer to mold the blade to their will, we have taken the hammer of Kvangha and bent the sands to our desire."

 F69_an_appropiate_incentive_title:0 "An Appropiate Incentive"
 F69_an_appropiate_incentive_desc:0 "Biakata was a truly unique individual. A human raised by gnolls, she united both gnoll and human into the second, and greatest, Fangaula Empire. This, however, is ancient history. Fangaula collapsed centuries ago. Furthermore, all diplomatic ties between humans and gnolls were severed in the wake of the Twin Xhazobine, as the scourge of the Kult spread across the region. It would be a dream to resurrect this empire, albeit this time under gnollish control rather than human.\n\nRight now it is but a dream to our pack. We are not in a position to rule over the humans at this time. However, we can use their squabbling against them. Some of the local human tribes have found themselves subjugated and could be…incentivized to trade their human rulers for gnollish ones. We will never convince them fully - at least not yet. But plant the seed of the idea amongst their people now and it could make future rule easier."

 F69_the_human_pack_title:0 "The Human Pack"
 F69_the_human_pack_desc:0 "Humans don’t form packs as gnolls do, which can sometimes make negotiations between gnoll and humans difficult. We find their hierarchical system of governance very confusing and illogical. It is still hierarchical though, with one human usually being the leader and spokesperson for their people. Perhaps the best way to deal with our new human subjects is to treat them as a semi-autonomous pack under our own, with the human leading them being granted the honorary title as pack leader.\n\nIf we can establish this new agreement between our ruler and our new human pack, future control of the humans will be significantly easier. They can choose how to rule the humans without the complications that arise when gnolls attempt to do so."

 F69_the_future_of_the_packs_title:0 "The Future of the Packs"
 F69_the_future_of_the_packs_desc:0 "As our human pack grows, the question of its future has become more pressing. Many within the Vog Mekza have grown uncomfortable with leaving Fangaula out of our direct control. Others feel that humans are better suited for the jungles, and that we should focus on our true home of the desert. If we are going to absorb their conquests and place them directly under our control, we should do it now before they grow too large."

 F69_delusions_of_grandeur_title:0 "Delusions of Grandeur"
 F69_delusions_of_grandeur_desc:0 "The Kultish gnolls under Tzilekal once held delusions of owning all of Fangaula under their rule, as the genies of old once did. How quaint. Show the remaining gnolls where the future of Fangaula truly lies."

 F69_biakata_the_great_title:0 "Biakata the Great"
 F69_biakata_the_great_desc:0 "The second Fangaula Empire, built by Biakata the Great, covered the entirety of the Fangaulan subcontinent, only prevented from further growth by the decadent khet of the Sorrow river. Human and gnoll ruled these lands as one. She may not have been of the Kvangagha faith, nor even a gnoll for that matter, but we can still recognise why she is spoken about in such glowing terms. Now the humans compare Irkorzik to Biakata, recognising her accomplishments are as incredible as those of Biakata."

 F69_one_court_a_vast_desert_title:0 "One Court, a Vast Desert"
 F69_one_court_a_vast_desert_desc:0 "Gnolls have lived migratory lives in the Salahad for centuries. The pack moved together as one, and with it moved all authority to rule over the sands. Our pack may have grown to encompass huge swaths of desert, meaning moving as one pack long since stopped being feasible, but we are still nomads at heart, as are our people. The Migratory Court is by far the best way to exert control over the desert. Do not expect your people to move to where you are. Move to where they are going. The sand may look static, but its grains constantly shift beneath our feet."

 F69_increased_potency_title:0 "Increased Potency"
 F69_increased_potency_desc:0 "Originally the use of sandstorms was purely for military purposes. Yet we found that, as the sandstorms subsided, the shifting sands could kick up hitherto unknown treasures beneath them. Deposits of iron and gems, wide tunnels dug by the Sand Demon, new water sources flowing deep underground. Inform the mages of their new goal: use their magical sandstorms for the purposes of uncovering natural resources."

 F69_nurture_our_home_title:0 "Nurture our Home"
 F69_nurture_our_home_desc:0 "The great cities of sandstone built by the gnolls of Irkorzik astound the people of Cannor and Haless. They can scarcely believe what we build in these harsh environments. Even their word for “desert” literally means “empty land”. Show the world just how full of life the Salahad truly is."

 F69_molding_the_sands_title:0 "Molding the Sands"
 F69_molding_the_sands_desc:0 "As the power of the mages to bend the sands to our will becomes more refined, the ability to do so becomes easier. Magical trinkets, developed by our mages, have started entering the hands of the Vog Mekza. The practical applications of this are profound. Yes we can make homes amongst the sand, but the sand does not always cooperate with us. Many a temple of Kvangagha has been swallowed by the desert before its construction could be finished. With the ability to mold the sands to our will, such events will be problems of the past."

 #The sand demon
 flavour_irkorzik.4.t:0 "The Sand Demon"
 flavour_irkorzik.4.d:0 "Kheterat has been attacked by a dragon before. A great bronze dragon by the name of Aakhet rose from his slumber to burn the city, before assuming the form of a human and announcing he was the new ruler of Kheterata. His trail of conquests only ended at the hands of the Salahad itself - or more specifically, the great dragon that travels beneath it.\n\nToday marks the second day a dragon crashed through the once-great city. From behind the Pyramid of Elikhet rose the Sand Demon of the Salahad. A flightless dragon, of a size so incomparable it beggared belief. It emerged from beneath the houses themselves, toppling buildings, covering the city in a whirring cloud of sand that it could seemingly move at will; crackling with the sounds of lightning, as the dragon roared and sunk back beneath the city again.\n\nFor the Kheteratans, this was a terrifying experience. It was too for the Vog Mekza, but for very different reasons. They knew of the Sand Demon in legends, but none had ever seen it for themselves. We thought we were masters of the Salahad, but watching its control over the sand has humbled us. The Salahad belongs to it, and for now it merely tolerates our presence.\n\nWe must find this dragon again. Scour the library at Koroshesh for every piece of writing on the Sand Demon. Interview every remote desert tribe, human and gnoll alike. Do everything we can to learn about it. Can it speak? Can we converse with it? Would it even listen to us? The fear amongst the Vog Mekza is palpable, but beyond that there is a sense of awe. To think this wondrous desert held such a magnificent creature!"

 #The Offering
 flavour_irkorzik.6.t:0 "The Offering"
 flavour_irkorzik.6.d:0 "The ritual started shortly after midnight. Camels had brought the offerings to the desert earlier in the day, then retreated to a safer place. Gnoll soldiers and Mašnsih humans with large drums beat out a slow rhythm to draw the dragon’s attention, led by [Ruler.GetTitle] [Ruler.GetName] themselves. The ritual took hours, right until the sun started peaking over the mountains that separated the Salahad from Rahen, until finally the Sand Demon answered the call.\n\nIt breached the sand from directly under the drummers, prompting both gnollish soldiers and Mašnsih humans to scream and flee. Its two haggard wings rose up and blotted out the rising sun, kicking up a whirlwind of sand in the process. The great dragon shook the sand from its body, its gaze shifting from the fleeing soldiers to the great pile of treasure, and finally lowered its head to stare directly at the one mortal that hadn’t fled: [Ruler.GetTitle] [Ruler.GetName]. A deathly silence spread across the scene as the two figures, so wildly different in height, stood their ground. Finally, [Ruler.GetName] spoke.\n\n“Oh great Sand Demon of the Salahad. We come bearing this great gift for you, recognising your power beneath the sands of this vast desert.” [Ruler.GetSheHe] gestured towards the treasure behind her, then turned and pointed to the sun rising over the mountains behind them. “All we ask of you in return is to recognise that every grain of sand that is touched by that light is our domain.” \n\nComplete silence, save for the sand still trickling from the dragon’s body. It leaned its head closer to [Ruler.GetName], sand falling off its spiked head and onto the [Ruler.GetTitle], right until its head was mere inches from the gnoll, its breathing visibly ruffling [Ruler.GetHisHer] fur. [Ruler.GetName] reached out their hand and, without flinching, placed it on the dragon’s snout. “Do we have a deal?”\n\nThe dragon let out a snort so sudden it blew over the [Ruler.GetTitle]. It whipped its giant tail into the ground, kicking up a massive cloud of sand that started swirling and crackling through the air. Then, as soon as it started, the sandstorm subsided; the dragon gone, treasure pile gone, [Ruler.GetTitle] [Ruler.GetName] standing alone, sand falling from their body, with a grin wider than the heavens, spread across their face. [Ruler.GetHeShe] turned to the crowd emerging from hiding, spread their arms wide as the sun rose from behind them, and started to laugh."

It was not a Xhazobine that united the gnolls, nor any other follower of that demonic cult, as we destroyed the last of its hateful ideology.\n\nInstead it was started by one gnoll who braved this harsh yet incredible desert and emerged a leader beyond any other, her legacy continued by every great leader who bore her name: Irkorzik.

 flavour_irkorzik.8.d:0 "The Vog Mekza have gathered, prepared to choose the next candidate to brave the Trials of Sand. The tribes have sent forward their candidate - a great orator, whose position as a spokesperson for the numerous tribes in our nation would make them a natural leader. The Vog Mekza have their own candidate, a prodigy from amongst their own. There also stands a final candidate, one who excelled not in the political sphere, but as a renowned guard for caravans that crossed the Salahad. Now we must decide which of these candidates will take the trials."

 flavour_irkorzik.9.t:0 "Choosing a trial"
 flavour_irkorzik.9.d:0 "Our candidate has been presented to the Dunesworn Council, whose task now is to decide what trial they must overcome to take the name Irkorzik. The harder the trial, the more prestigious a candidate that passes it will be seen as. The classic trial is to venture into the Salahad and slay a sandwalker - a terrifying 12-foot long giant scorpion, the predator of many a wandering caravan. Failure though shall be judged more harshly, so perhaps simply guarding a caravan through the desert shall suffice. However, if one truly wishes to prove themselves as the successor to Irkorzik herself, they must do what she did: survive deep in the Salahad alone for six months."

 #Trials of the sand (easy): Success
 flavour_irkorzik.10.t:0 "Trials of the Sand: Success"
 flavour_irkorzik.10.d:0 "Our candidate has returned safely, with a seal from the town on the other side of the Salahad standing as proof of the caravan’s safe journey."
 flavour_irkorzik.10.a:0 "The succession is secure"

 #Trials of the sand (easy): Failure
 flavour_irkorzik.11.t:0 "Trials of the Sand: Failure"
 flavour_irkorzik.11.d:0 "After months with no signs of our candidate, the terrible news finally reached the Dunesworn Council. The caravan they were guiding across the desert had been found trashed and looted, surrounded by corpses, including that of our candidate."
 flavour_irkorzik.11.a:0 "How could they fail the easy trial!?"

 #Trials of the sand (medium): Success
 flavour_irkorzik.12.t:0 "Trials of the Sand: Success"
 flavour_irkorzik.12.d:0 "A large crowd had gathered in [Root.Capital] to welcome our candidate home. They marched through the streets, dragging the massive corpse of the great beast behind them. Crowds whooped and hollered, a spit was prepared to roast the sandwalker, and a toast was prepared to celebrate our new leader."
 flavour_irkorzik.12.a:0 "A fine ruler they will surely make"

 #Trials of the sand (medium): Failure
 flavour_irkorzik.13.t:0 "Trials of the Sand: Failure"
 flavour_irkorzik.13.d:0 "It was late at night when the search party returned, carrying the mangled corpse of our candidate. It appears they were successful at least in locating a sandwalker. They simply failed the second, more challenging part of the trial."
 flavour_irkorzik.13.a:0 "Our next candidate will surely succeed"

 #Trials of the sand (hard): Success
 flavour_irkorzik.14.t:0 "Trials of the Sand: Success"
 flavour_irkorzik.14.d:0 "Few expected our candidate to return. Though we claim to have mastered the Salahad, six months alone is a near impossible task. The Dunesworn Council had even convened to discuss whether attempting to achieve what Irkorzik herself did was just sending promising young leaders to their doom. And yet they did return. Haggard and worn, but triumphant."

 flavour_irkorzik.15.d:0 "Our candidate has been finally located. Partially buried in a sand dune, their body was surprisingly intact. But they were not capable of surviving the Salahad as Irkorzik herself once did."
 flavour_irkorzik.15.a:0 "Is there no one worthy of Irkorzik’s legacy?"

 #Emergency measures
 flavour_irkorzik.17.t:0 "Emergency Measures"
 flavour_irkorzik.17.d:0 "Our pack leader has died without an appropriate heir. As it was dictated, it now falls onto the Dunesworn Council to rule the pack while a new heir is chosen."
