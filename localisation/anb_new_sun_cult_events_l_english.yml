 new_sun_cult.1.t:0 "The Clergy Pulls Away"
 new_sun_cult.1.d:0 "The clergy say they answer only to the will of Surael's chosen, and therefore refuse to head the commands of a government not led by Sun Elves."
 new_sun_cult.1.a:0 "We thought they might do this."
 new_sun_cult.2.t:0 "The Elves Pull Away"
 new_sun_cult.2.d:0 "With new human recruits flooding into our armies and rising to higher ranks within them, we can no longer call what we have an elven military. It is more of a combination of human and elf now, and thoroughly dominated in numbers by the former."
 new_sun_cult.2.a:0 "We'll have to promote new officers quickly."
 new_sun_cult.3.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Proves [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Military Prowess"
 new_sun_cult.3.d:0 "It is improper for the general populace to see their ruler so... involved in martial, worldly, affairs. If we want to keep things as they are, we should ask [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to go back to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace and let other, lesser, beings lead our armies."
 new_sun_cult.3.a:0 "We will see how things play out."
 new_sun_cult.4.t:0 "A True Battle[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 new_sun_cult.4.d:0 "The frequent sight of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] winning glorious victories in the name of Surael has caused the people to see [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as rooted in the real world; less divine by nature and more divine by the empowerment of Surael."
 new_sun_cult.4.a:0 "Oh well, at least [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] likes fighting."
 # removed event 5 because it wasn't fun.
 new_sun_cult.6.t:0 "A Loss in Faith"
 new_sun_cult.6.d:0 "Our overlord has passed, and with him Surael's Light grows dimmer. How could they leave us with such turmoil in their wake?"
 new_sun_cult.6.a:0 "We must find His light, and pick up the pieces as best we can."
 new_sun_cult.7.t:0 "no Moh setup"
 new_sun_cult.7.d:0 ""
 new_sun_cult.7.a:0 "Ok"
 new_sun_cult.8.t:0 "Lucian Carter"
 new_sun_cult.8.d:0 "The driftwood pirates of Drolakand, who hunt the eastern Divenhal, know stolen and jury-rigged boats cannot stand up to a fully protected trade flotilla. So, as beggars can't be choosers, they happily pounce on unexciting but accessible opportunities that gnolls might ignore.\n\nThe small dhow floating under the grey [GetMonth] sky was clearly one such target, with not a single cannon showing on deck. Seizing it went smoothly for the experienced pirates; not a single wound was taken, and the ambushed crew quickly surrendered. Fortunately, the hold was not completely empty; unfortunately, it seemed to have nothing of any value whatsoever. It was almost entirely taken up by a few crates of strange contraptions with unclear purpose - and similarly befuddling methods of use - and vast reams of paper dense with text. Still, with the approval of the Pirate-Akal, and the help of some gnollish contacts in Nathalaire, the crews' ransom might yield the gold that the ship did not. The day was done and the driftwood pirates headed back to Betelis, content with simple profits for a simple opportunity taken.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\nBecause among this crew was a very strange man, not at all like most others the Drolas had encountered. Prisoners are supposed to be swimming in a mix of shock and fear, but this 'Lucian Carter' was instead... incessantly trying to make conversation in a mixture of Common and broken Bulwari! In a friendly tone! Not even the threat of chains and gags dimmed the brightness of his face, as he asked prying questions of our faith in Surael, and dropped off-hand mentions of new discoveries in the west.\n\nThis was clearly a matter for the Pirate-Akal. And so upon arrival in Betelis, he was delivered to the Akal's hideout, and surely her forbidding demeanour would put the proper fear in this strange man. Surely."
 new_sun_cult.8.a:0 "What a peculiar man"
 new_sun_cult.9.t:0 "One Lucian Carter, One Peninsula, One God"
 new_sun_cult.9.d:0 "The Pirate-Akal did not inspire fear in Lucian Carter. Indeed, the inspiration seemed to have gone the other way - after a brief conversation in public, the Pirate-Akal pulled him into a smaller room. An hour or so later, she ordered a few of the strange objects captured with the ship brought in. And after two hours, with a demonstration of a small object which shone piercing, directed, light, Lucian Carter had been announced as her new chief advisor.\n\nBut the Drolas are not greedy like the Brasanni, no; what one family member owns every family member owns. And so Lucian Carter soon found himself passed from cousin to cousin, sister to aunt, mother to daughter, and to each, teaching the use of common, basic arithmetic, the use of various small inventions. All intermixed, of course, with lessons about a new God, the only God, of whom Surael and all the others who perished long ago are merely a fragment. A chained god, a betrayed god, now released to guide us all.\n\nLucian Carter has proven to be a popular man in the Drolas peninsula, and even received leave to invite some comrades from Anbenncóst to join him. New schools and hospitals have been built under his direction, with the funds from ransoming his crew having paid for the first. His teachings have proven popular amongst the Drolas, long a backwater of Bulwar, and the region has flourished under the Ravelian One God after being seemingly all-but-ignored by Surael. Ravelianism has landed in Bulwar; where it goes next, only Surael," or perhaps The Fragment, knows."
 new_sun_cult.9.a:0 "Leave him be"
 new_sun_cult.9.b:0 "Expel him and bring his followers back into the Light."
 new_sun_cult.10.t:0 "The Return of the Mages"
 new_sun_cult.10.da:0 "With our recent change of rulership, we're no longer bound by the restrictions placed on human practiced magic. The ban has been lifted and the mages have come back to our country."
 new_sun_cult.10.db:0 "With our recent change of faith, we're no longer bound by the unjust rules of Sun Elves. The ban on human practiced magic has been lifted and the mages have come back to our country."
 new_sun_cult.10.a:0 "Lets give them a warm welcome."

 #Dukeldar
 new_sun_cult.15.t:0 "The Dukeldar"
 new_sun_cult.15.d:0 "The Sun Elves have long dominated the lands of Bulwar by claiming a divine status handed down to them from Surael himself, a golden mask of godhood for their race to wear. However, recent events have started to crack this facade. Whilst the followers of Jaher may be blessed by Surael, may even hear his voice, this does not convey a right to rulership. Repeated failures to defend our lands and manage the realm has brought into question whether the Sun Elves should even concern themselves with earthly matters as they have been distracted from their true task; communion with the heavens. Even now, there are whispers in the shadowed corners of our nation, conspiracies to remove the Sun Elf rulers of our state and place them back on the proper path.\n\nThe knives are coming out and the chains are being readied. Whether the Sun Elves prove their right to rule to the court and people, or they are removed from the positions that keep them from their righteous task, Surael's will shall be done, one way or another."
 new_sun_cult.15.a:0 "The chosen of the sun at last show their feet of clay"
 new_sun_cult.16.t:0 "The Court Turns Their Back On Us"
 new_sun_cult.16.d:0 "The recent instability of our state has finally started to bear its rotten fruit. Despite the Sun Elves' right to rule, we have always been far too few to run every aspect of government. As such, we have been forced to employ our lesser to pad out the administrative staff's numbers. Now those very same whelps we lifted out of barbarity have turned their back on us. Officials and ministers from inside the court and across the nation have presented us with demands and threats of rebellion. They ask for greater influence over the realm and for reform of the state. There are even whispers that they would relegate the Chosen people to a ceremonial role, becoming rulers themselves in all but name. Well - they shall have our answer."
 new_sun_cult.16.a:0 "They dare question the Chosen of the sun!"
 new_sun_cult.16.b:0 "Perhaps some concessions are in order."
 new_sun_cult.17.t:0 "The Military Demands More Pay"
 new_sun_cult.17.d:0 "Despite the military legacy handed down by Jaher and his conquests, the vast majority of the Sun Elf military is made up of humans. Whilst the highest echelons of command are reserved for the Chosen people, most of our lower military staff is, by necessity, composed of humans - to say nothing of the bulk of our actual troops.\n\nIn light of recent events, a cabal of these human officers and troops have come forward to demand more pay or they, along with their fellow conspirators, will spread chaos throughout the human ranks. Whilst many of our Sun Elf generals balk at the very idea of raising the pay of the human masses, as they believe the troops should be happy with what they have, there are some who warn of the possible damage these men could do to our standing army. Many nations have fallen to an ambitious general at the head of rebellious troops. The troops demand an answer now and so we must be decisive at this moment."
 new_sun_cult.17.a:0 "They will fight for what we give them."
 new_sun_cult.17.b:0 "We need soldiers we must concede."
 new_sun_cult.18.t:0 "The Clergy Propose a Deal"
 new_sun_cult.18.d:0 "The recent instability has affected all facets of our society. From the highest lord to the lowest peasant, all can see the realm slip further and further out of our grip. The clergy are no exception. The keepers of Surael's will have approached the court with a deal - they will go to the rebels and attempt to calm and mediate their issues. All they ask in return is more autonomy within the realm, and certain other concessions that would dramatically increase their own power and influence over the land.\n\nWhilst there are those who decry the deal, calling it a naked power grab that will ultimately weaken the court in the long run, others point out that angering the Clergy will only make the situation worse and perhaps even tip the balance of power in favour of the rebels. Whether or not we can afford either choice is yet to be seen."
 new_sun_cult.18.a:0 "The faithful have always been our greatest friends."
 new_sun_cult.18.b:0 "I will not give up my crown to a bunch of priests."
 new_sun_cult.19.t:0 "Populace Protest Against the Hierarchy"
 new_sun_cult.19.d:0 "It is no secret that the society of the Sun Elf realms is one of strict hierarchy and rigid structure. Whilst there are some minor concessions given to the humans and other races that live within our borders, the actual power and important positions are reserved for the Chosen people, the Sun Elves.\n\nWhilst this has long been seen as the proper order of things, reinforced by both the faith and the apparatus of the state, resentment is inevitable. With our recent misfortune, many old grudges and hatreds have bubbled to the top of our society. Mass riots and protests choke our city streets and the rural peasantry turn more to banditry over tending to their fields. Whilst there are many factions, all demand systemic change across our realm. Although open rebellion has been averted so far, our troops are overstretched even as the violence grows. Some even whisper that this unrest heralds the end of the Sun Elves' reign, and that it is time for something new to rise from the ashes of Elven dominion."
 new_sun_cult.19.a:0 "The Light of Surael has forsaken his chosen people."
 new_sun_cult.20.t:0 "Nobility Rally to our Flag"
 new_sun_cult.20.d:0 "Despite the chaos sweeping through our nation, threatening to rip it apart, there are still those who remain loyal to the tenets and precepts passed down by Jaher all those centuries ago. Amid the violence a group of nobles have rallied to our cause, bringing with them much needed influence, wealth, and stability.\n\nWhilst this support will certainly help ease the current situation, there are worries about the court that this support is nothing more than a cynical power grab. Backing us over the rebels - as if we were some prized horse racing for the nobility's pleasure. Some clamour for us to reject these duplicitous offers of aid and bring the realm fully under control ourselves, but as things worsen, turning away help may prove disastrous."
 new_sun_cult.20.a:0 "The aid of those truly faithful will always be welcome."
 new_sun_cult.20.b:0 "We need not the help of noble fools!"
 new_sun_cult.21.t:0 "The Masses Find a Leader"
 new_sun_cult.21.d:0 "Whilst rebellion has been rife across our nation, it has for the most part been fragmented and scattered, with little in the way of leadership - that is until now. The rebels have rallied around one [dukedal_pretender.GetName], an able and charismatic human who has at last managed to pull the various factions in the ongoing crisis together.\n\nEven now, whispers reach our ears of the promises they have made to the people of the realm. To remove the chosen people from rulership and set up a regime under their control, to remove the corruption of the elves from our society, and create a new fairer realm as Surael decrees. While utterly preposterous, their message has clearly resonated with the unquiet rebels. Thousands flock to this pretender's banner and their armies bear down upon us; we must take up arms for the future of our people and the victory of Surael's will!"
 new_sun_cult.21.a:0 "This rebel will die like all the others."
 new_sun_cult.22.t:0 "Jadd Heresy in [Root.GetName]"
 new_sun_cult.22.d:0 "Great change and new thought can be as much a curse to the faithful as a blessing to the wise. The province of [Root.GetName] has abandoned the true way of Surael and converted to The Jadd. The current chaos has shaken the faith of many in our realm and have caused many to question the truth of things.\n\nThe Jadd with its talk of equality and egalitarianism has proved seductive to some in our realm and it has fully taken root in [Root.GetName]. Although the faithful mock and scorn the fools who would abandon the true faith, some find this worrying. If the faith itself can be dislodged so easily, then what hope can our realm have?"
 new_sun_cult.22.a:0 "Light the pyres, for heresy lurks in the shadows!"
 new_sun_cult.23.t:0 "The Old Faith Returns in [Root.GetName]"
 new_sun_cult.23.d:0 "Uncertainty is a plague upon the faithful, for it eats away at the very pillars of belief, and if nothing else these are uncertain times. The fools in [Root.GetName] have abandoned the true way of Surael and returned to the Old Sun Cult.\n\nLong thought all but extinct, the chaos of the current crisis have driven many back into the arms of the old heresies that Jaher and his followers drove from the land ago, believing now that the Sun Elves are not worthy of homage. Though we are sure this wave of disbelief can be rectified, the fact that there are those who still preach the old faith is troubling and may cause issues if not stamped out quickly."
 new_sun_cult.23.a:0 "The new Light will banish the old just like in ages past!"
 new_sun_cult.24.t:0 "The Court Attempts to Flee"
 new_sun_cult.24.d:0 "The Court of our glorious nation has always been home to whispers and intrigue. Secrets, lies, and plots flitter like flocks of birds between our countries and not a day go by that some new scheme reaches our ears. But the newest whispers tell of a conspiracy that is beyond the pale.\n\nOur advisors, the very centre of our court, those we have shown the most favour, plan to abandon us. They claim that the ongoing uprising has broken their faith in the throne, and they intend to leave before our actions tear apart the realm. Insolence and treachery aside, our advisors have undoubtedly been a great boon during the current crisis and a mass exodus of talent could prove disastrous. Perhaps some well-placed bribes could encourage our advisors to stay - but can we ever truly trust an advisor who aids us for gold rather than duty?"
 new_sun_cult.24.a:0 "In times of crisis, gold is no object for the sake of stability."
 new_sun_cult.24.b:0 "We can only afford so much."
 new_sun_cult.24.c:0 "I'd rather put a sword through their hearts than have a knife in my back."
 new_sun_cult.25.t:0 "Desertions Plague the Army"
 new_sun_cult.25.d:0 "It is said that a man will fight for crown, for faith and for home, yet these have proven insufficient in the face of the growing disaster. Not a day goes by that reports flood in from our commanders speaking of desertion and defection on a scale that could very well render our legions gutted and worthless. Many of these men have turned to banditry or even joined the rebels to overturn our rule, bought on false promises and empty hopes. Requests pile up for more pay, more food, better officers and a thousand more besides.\n\nWithout an army, this regime will surely perish - yet to gather the resources needed to solve the issue may prove more disastrous in the long, if even possible. The legions await our decision and it may well decide the fate of our glorious realm."
 new_sun_cult.25.a:0 "A man who would walk away from duty is not one I would have in my army; let them go."
 new_sun_cult.25.b:0 "The legions are the backbone of the realm; give them what they want."
 new_sun_cult.26.t:0 "The Dukeldar Comes to a Close"
 new_sun_cult.26.da:0 "The sun rises high above our realm, as if to reflect the thousand banners signalling our triumph over those who would have cast out the chosen people of the sun! The rebels lie broken and defeated, those who would have cast our people from the heights of rulership are dead, the temples restored to their proper glory and the people reminded of the proper order of the world.\n\nNo more will there be whispers of the overthrow of the Sun Elves, no more will there be questions of our right to rule! The legacy of Jaher is secured! And we will not let it slip again."
 new_sun_cult.26.db:0 "The sun hangs low in the evening sky, and with its setting the old order falls. Those who for centuries have claimed a divine right to rule - passed down from Surael himself - have failed, dragged from their thrones and mansions from which they lorded over the people of Bulwar. Yet despite the darkness, each sunset promises a new morning - the true will of Surael will at last be done, the Sun Elves will no longer lead us down the path of decadence and mortal sin. The old order lies in ruins, but on these ruins a new and better nation can be built in a new and glorious dawn."
 new_sun_cult.26.a:0 "The Sun Elves have stood for centuries and will stand centuries more."
 new_sun_cult.26.b:0 "The True will of Surael will at last be the law of the land."

 #Bulwar under threat
 new_sun_cult.49.t:0 "The Decades of Devastation"
 new_sun_cult.49.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe past few decades have taken a heavy toll on the Sun Elven states in Bahar. We have been plagued with famine and infighting, then goblins from the mountains, heresy, and rebellion. It is not only destroying the land, it is destroying the humans' trust in us.\n\n"How could Surael's Chosen not have stopped this?" voices cry, if far and few between. "They have been too busy fighting each other for claims and wealth, they ignore our suffering!"\n\nWe realize now that our infighting was foolish in the face of the disasters happening around us. Our brash confidence has nearly proven our undoing. This cannot continue; the people must have absolute faith in us so that we might lead them to Surael's Light.\n\nWe will have to find ways to counteract the atrocities of these past decades of war and hunger, such that the light shines on Bahar's bright future ahead and not its gloomy past."
 new_sun_cult.49.a:0 "Surael willing, we will get ahead of this."
 new_sun_cult.50.t:0 "A Shadow on the Sun"
 new_sun_cult.50.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nBulwar has seen many threats in its past, but usually there was a greater power around to hold things together. Were the Sun Elven monarchies and human city-states united as one, the constant raids from harpies in the north and gnolls in the south and east would have faced a solid body of force, rather than our individual armies, scattered about territories and vulnerable to being picked off.\n\nOur people cry: "They have barely even been seen since these disasters began." It is a shameful truth that we did too little to stop all this. We stayed in our palaces, focusing on our own affairs and the worship of Surael, confident that our armies and priests would handle the situation.\n\nThat was not the case, and these large incursions into our lands have worn us all down and left us weakened. If we do not act now to repel these monsters or stabilize our country, then it will not matter which of the Phoenix Estates is truly chosen by Surael to restore the Phoenix Empire -- there won't be any of us left to try."
 new_sun_cult.50.a:0 "The light must shine bright in [Root.GetName], and the darkness be banished!"
 new_sun_cult.51.t:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Speech"
 new_sun_cult.51.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe plan is clear: our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will make a speech to the people, with couriers to send the message to all corners of our nation. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will promise to improve the lives of the people and ensure their safety, as is [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] duty as one of Surael's Chosen. The people gaze up in wonder but also in agitation - things are getting very bad in Bulwar, and they need something to grasp onto in hope.\n\nDartaxes, unquelled rebellion, and other strife has caused many with little reason to question their faith in us to stir and rise up with thoughts of the old ways (and the human-run kingdoms that saw the Age of Monsters come). We have even heard whispers of vile heresy: that we are usurpers, and must be removed by any means necessary. Our administration is woefully unequipped to handle this dissent, and the more the people are mishandled by crude actions, the more of them join these causes.\n\nBeyond our borders, the monsters press ever closer, raids striking ever further. Our military has suffered loss after loss and the people fear that soon it will not be the reasonable Sun Elves that they rebel against, but the demon-worshipping gnolls, or the man-stealing harpies, or the savage goblins from the mountains.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will make a pledge to the people to end this instability and push back the invaders! All we need now is to figure out where to start and how to go about all this."
 new_sun_cult.51.a:0 "Pledge to restore order in the realm before §Y10 years§! have passed."
 new_sun_cult.52.t:0 "Reform the Administration"
 new_sun_cult.52.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWith our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s promise made, we must immediately begin making good on it and stabilizing [Root.GetName]. There are two major areas we can focus on.\n\nFirst is the fact that many in our administration have become rather corrupt, money leaking out from dozens of holes and causing our work to stagnate. Fixing this would promote good practices, less extortion of humans, and more issues resolved without the need for our hand in the matter. Additionally, it would ensure every Sun Elf lives up to their responsibilities as the chosen of Surael.\n\nThe other option is to open new levels of administration and fill the positions with worthy human subjects. This would give them a voice, lower down on the chain, and hopefully reduce the negative impact of any corruption that trickles down that far. However, doing so will certainly anger our kin who are used to their patronage appointments.\n\nWe dare not attempt to do both at once, given our bureaucracy's rustiness and our strained resources, but hopefully focusing our efforts on one of them will be enough to solve the problems."

 new_sun_cult.52.c:0 "Go back."
 new_sun_cult.53.t:0 "Corrupt Elves Are Resisting"
 new_sun_cult.53.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe corrupt officials in our administration are resisting our attempts to have their indulgent ways brought to heel. A group of the most influential have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seeking a meeting and have brought a small 'token of appreciation' to warm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ear."
 new_sun_cult.53.a:0 "Well, it would be rude to refuse a gift..."
 new_sun_cult.53.b:0 "This is truly unacceptable - strip them of their rank and send them to jail!"
 new_sun_cult.54.t:0 "Social Mobility for Humans?"
 new_sun_cult.54.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nA group of prominent human citizens have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a complaint. Despite our efforts to crack down on the corruption which has been extorting them, they are concerned that in the future there will be no guarantee that these burdens remain gone.\n\nThey request that humans be allowed the social mobility to rise beyond their current means, if not to high ranks of government which obviously should remain the domain of Surael's Chosen - still high enough to have the clout to avoid the effects of administrative malice and guarantee their people a place in the future."
 new_sun_cult.54.a:0 "Humans have a place, and it is not up here in the courts. Make no such promises."
 new_sun_cult.54.b:0 "Perhaps it is time we made some concessions to these humans."

They demand that they be given the same rights as those who live in the cities! If we do not grant them this, our advisors believe they may start rioting, as there are already reports of violent groups of peasants gathering in some of the less-reputable drinking establishments in our realm."

They propose reordering and training our armies to be deployable anywhere at a moment's notice in smaller, better trained groups.\n\nThe last option is to rely on sheer volume of bodies on the field.

We could rely on a quicker training program to get troops in the field, while letting our officers train much longer to ensure their skill. We could follow the vanguard's method and train officers and soldiers together in small groups so they act in harmony.

He was the rock that held the squabbling temples together across nations, from far eastern Azka-Sur to the docks of Re-Uyel. There will be a great funeral procession for him through the streets of Irrliam and out to the nearby hills, where a great pyre will be lit to send him to Surael, with a flame so great that it will be visible from Brasan to Kalib.\n\nAlready, though, the ripples of his passing are being felt within the temples, and the air is filled with whispered questions of what will happen now that he is gone. So many aspects of the faith were seen to and administered by Taelarios himself that no single individual could ever truly fill his shoes. Of course, this meant that we held great sway and influence within the faith, and it would of course be best for all if it stayed that way.\n\nThankfully, our close ties to our human subjects, our allies across Bulwar, and that legacy of influence (prior to the power vacuum) give us a unique opportunity to find a solution. Hopefully, together, we will be able to sort out this potential crisis through debate in a great council of the members of the New Sun Cult.\n\nLed by Irrliam, of course."

Apparently many parts of the inner workings of the faith were seen to by Taelarios himself, and only he. The lords and priests in Irrliam seem to be trying to organize some form of council to try and find solutions to this potential crisis that everyone can accept.

After The Xhazobine, of course, things in Bulwar were nightmarish. Though she was eventually defeated, gnollish warlords would go on to ravage Bulwar in constant fights and raids for power and slaves.\n\nEverything changed when Jaher ta'Diranhriá arrived in 1001 AA and began his liberation of Bulwar and the lands beyond.

They were allowed free reign on how to deal with these individuals, which usually meant great spectacles of execution, entirely outside of the Order of Judges' remit.\n\nTheir second, lesser known, task was to convince other Sun Cult leaders to step in line with Taelarios, keeping him and Irrliam as a whole on top of the pile.

The priesthood made a proclamation then that Jaher's divinity, as granted by Surael, had passed on to his kin upon his death, making Sun Elves the Chosen people of Surael and, as such, divine in their own right.\n\nThere have, of course, always been people who think otherwise. Some maintain that no one could truly embody Surael's majesty and that only parts of his divinity are in the Sun Elves. Some believe they are not divine at all, and simply share a connection to Surael. As such a core tenet of our belief, it is vital that we have a unified opinion on this matter."

With Irrliam leading this council, most agreed with their decisions in all the debates, ensuring their wisdom will continue to guide us theologically and to settle disputes and issues in a way that satisfies all involved.\n\nAfter an entire night of festivities and games, the sun rises on the delegations leaving Medurubar to return to their respective nations, with priests and scribes carrying copies of the Debates' minutes in tow, to spread the good news to their homes and peoples.\n\nThis marks the start of a new age for Bulwar, one of unity and strength through faith in Surael. Let any who would challenge us now face the combined might of a unified Bulwar, ready to face the Darkness and push it back from whence it came, whatever it may be and wherever it may have come from.

Others, however, are already preparing to leave the city, disgruntled by the lack of cooperation and consensus during the Council Debates.\n\nThough many things were decided upon, it was not as unanimous as many would have hoped, with plenty of disagreements and arguments over the decisions made. There will be enough support to ensure the results are enforced but not enough that we can truly say that Bulwar has been unified in the New Sun Cult faith.

No real solid decisions were made and there was no unity to be found amongst the various nations representatives.\n\nAs the last debate ended, with many storming out in frustration before its real conclusion, the sun sets on a city which was prepared for wonder and has experienced only disappointment. The great fires we prepared to brighten up the night have gone unlit, the games and entertainment stands lay empty, the food and drinks untouched except by the poor and those who spent their day preparing it.\n\nThis night will not be a night of celebration, pushing back the Darkness. It will be a night of quiet contemplation on what went so wrong as to make Surael's people so consumed by infighting and petty politics. We can only hope now that this will not be a catalyst for further separation between the nations of the New Sun Cult. Though only Surael knows what will come next."

And if Surael wishes them saved, then they eventually will be, by our hand or otherwise.\n\nIt is best to let these things lie and focus on our own issues rather than those of strangers in strange lands.

As the ruling class of the region, with already minimal numbers, especially in comparison to their human subjects, many Sun Elves are torn. The desire to return to the home of their ancestors is very strong, the knowledge that it is so underpopulated making the desire to return and make a new, elven, home for themselves even stronger. Some, though, do not wish to return. They see the lives they lead here in Bulwar as superior to any they might make in Aelantir, being worshipped as holy beings here and no more than just another elf if they left. Those who wish to stay have been trying their best to dissuade their more eager kin from leaving, thus weakening the already tenuous position they hold in Bulwar.\n\nThen, there are the humans, who will no doubt see the mass exodus of their deified ruling class as a sign that Surael is abandoning them for the old home of the elves, his Chosen people.\n\nIn this time of uncertainty, everyone is turning to our ruler to seek [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] guidance."

Wealth and relics are streaming back by the boatload to be displayed by proud Sun Elven monarchs and wealthy human merchants.\n\nDespite all this, there is an abiding worry that the Chosen are abandoning their people in Bulwar. Though humans have risen to fill the gaps, and for the most part have done an adequate job, the concern that Surael's Light will leave with the Sun Elves to Aelantir still has the common folk in a panic.\n\nMany human groups have taken to sending their own colonizers to Aelantir to join with the elves, as they feel it is their duty to follow their masters. While this may be bringing wealth back to Bulwar, it does nothing for morale to see even the common folk abandoning their homes. Surael's Light will be made to shine on every part of Aelantir at this rate, and the wealth it reveals from the shadows shall return here to Bulwar, but at what cost?

Ships are cheaper than ever as the dockyards are always churning out new vessels to replace those lost, or to swell the merchant fleets that travel to and from the west.\n\nThe Lost Continent does, however, present the issue of an easy alternative to those who are unhappy with their nation's rule; disgruntled soldiers who cannot advance or peasants who have saved enough to buy passage hoping to find cheaper land and lower taxes. All things under the sun have both good and bad within them, and these Aelantir expeditions seem to be no exception."

While we have prevented the main body of our elven populace from going west through rhetoric, promises, bribes, and other such means, there are still many holes left in our society by those who departed. Many humans have risen in status to fill these gaps, and we have sought to convince the doubters that the departure of a handful of elves is not a tragedy but a boon, allowing them to rise above what they would otherwise have been.\n\nThe adventuring companies are the only ones we have not been able to convince. They wish to set up other expeditions, certain that there is enough wealth to be found in Aelantir to buy a country, if only it could be found. But there simply are not enough ships to go around, nor funds available for these journeys, and more and more, people are less willing to join in these journeys, preferring to stay, as we have suggested is right."

Magic is a privilege given to us by Surael himself, and us alone.\n\nBut the humans make a decent point. Artifice is not technically magic, at least not directly. We have convened a council of wise elders, mages, priests, and scientists - all elves of course - to determine the risks of artifice and analyze any potential benefits to allowing the people to make use of it.

Therefore, they say, artifice should be pursued, without a doubt, but only by the Sun Elves who will do so responsibly and with grace.\n\nThe proclamation the following day was met with mixed reactions. While the people were pleased that artifice would be making its way into their lives to their benefit, many were disgruntled by the news that only the elves would be allowed to pursue its development.

It is enough to make a glassblower weep, and to see the offending porter banished forever, even if it only happens once-a-decade at most.\n\nWhat, then, will be the reaction now that the secret of Azanerdu glass has itself been shattered forever? A master glassblower was entranced of the Ravelian whisperings that arrived in the city with Busilari merchants, and took to heart the God Fragment's truth that magic must be made accessible to all, and that the Day of Ashen Skies was the product of magic being stolen and hoarded. The implication was then obvious for the magic of his craft.\n\nWorking with the local Ravelian society, he wrote the method of Azanerdu Glass — the admixture of gold salts at a precise point in the glass-forming process results in that distinctive red shade -- into a manual, which was then distributed to Ravelian societies across Cannor and beyond.\n\nAzanerdu's secret has been forever lost, even if the city's name still bears an associated prestige. But it is [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that looks to the future, and must figure out what to do with the pieces.

 new_sun_cult.210.daelantir:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nRavelianism has arrived in [Root.GetName]. A land with one god who burns in the sky above has heard the truths, the tellings, the tale, of the One God and its lone surviving fragment.\n\nYou can see it in the missionaries on-board every merchant ship arriving from the East, who proscribe the sale of artifice trinkets and accompany every transaction with religious literature. You can see it in the scholars who have come to the ruined continent, who call themselves by the strange term "Veridical", and seek some of its oldest works. And though it has yet to truly spread far among the faithful, you can see it in the whispers exchanged between priests before and after the noon prayers to Surael and in the subtext of conversations between Sun Elves: that some of the flock they shepherd is going astray: lured, ensnared, deceived.\n\nThese matters have bubbled for long enough, and it is time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to give them [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attention before decisions are taken out of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands. We have long ignored Cannor's fascination with dead gods, even their elevation of a strange heroine to similar status, knowing that Surael and Surael alone reigns supreme. But how shall [Root.GetName] handle this new faith, which seems more potent — and perhaps more intriguing — than any before?"
 new_sun_cult.211.daelantir:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe trade-ship is innocuous. It largely consists of Busilari iron and wood, not an uncommon product in the markets of [Root.Capital.GetName]. At first glance, the only oddity is the thick black robes worn by some of its attendants — they must be roasting, the dark fabric drinking in Surael's blazing light and heat.\n\nBut, of course, this is not just any merchant caravan. And these are not just any visitors from out of town. These are Ravelian missionaries, including even a lesser Veridical among their number. They are not merely transiting through -- it seems they have bought a small house on the outskirts of [Root.Capital.GetName] and converted it into a school-temple.\n\nThe artificer trinkets they show off there draw a decent crowd, who cannot help but hear about the One God who - the missionaries claim — has provided these wonders in its demand that Its magic be free to all. Already, many local priests are condemning the Ravelians' work as a distraction — or worse — from the proper respect due to Surael. How should [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] approach these newcomers?"
 new_sun_cult.213.daelantir:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe Ravelian faith spreads primarily via trade, as priest-merchants make their way across the world and bring the teachings of the One God with them. Indeed, ever since King Varil Silnara of Busilar converted the country in full to Ravelianism, by state policy a Ravelian missionary has accompanied every trading ship setting out from their shores, even to far-flung [Root.GetName].\n\nMost of the clergy in [Root.GetName] would see Surael's sun scorch these 'falsehood-peddlers' from the realm. But the merchants instead focus on the way the sunlight sparkles on the Busilari coinage, the new products, machines, and resources the Ravelians have brought to gleam in the sun. Whatever their provenance, surely Surael would frown on us ignoring any gift that might help oppose the darkness?\n\nThis matter has recently come to a head, and drawn the attention of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], as a small Ravelian trading community has formed in [ravelian_province.GetName] around a few school-temples. It is the hub of a thriving exchange in goods -- and in Ravelian ideas. Should [Root.Monarch.GetName] take action to crush this, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] might an enemy's foothold that they would use for further invasion? Or should [Root.GetSheHe] leave it be, and reap the rewards with some mild taxation?"
 new_sun_cult.214.daelantir:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nBefore Ravelianism was a faith, it was a philosophy, from which scholarly Ravelian societies sprang like weeds. An organization devoted to the pursuit of knowledge free of preconception and prior dogma; even before the God Fragment was discovered, the Ravelians were a source of tension in Cannor and Aelantir, and a source of new ideas.\n\nFrom the merchant community in [ravelian_province.GetName], one such Ravelian society has formed, a collection of scholars discussing the latest teachings of the One God, perusing the latest discoveries in Aelantir, and infuriating many of [Root.GetName]'s theologians with their recently-published claims and hypotheses.\n\nIs the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] content with such an institution existing in the realm, and perhaps drawing followers to the Ravelian claims and beliefs? Or should we immediately muster some troops, and perhaps call in some inquisitors from Irrliam, to see this infestation crushed like a weed?"
 new_sun_cult.215.daelantir:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nEven though we live far from Bulwar, our people recall many of the monsters that used to raid that land: maruading gnolls, shrieking harpies. They could come from seemingly nowhere to smite the land like a curse, engage for a few hours or days in a spree of abduction and looting, and then leave burning buildings, shattered families, and a scarred village in their wake.\n\nThe events yesterday in [raided_province.GetName] has had similar consequences. Lives ended, buildings razed, the city scarred. But this was not the product of monsters; it was the work of Surael-worshipping citizens in the town, who claimed the local Ravelian Society was a font of The Darkness and needed to be purged with His light.\n\nThe wounded Ravelians (and the merchants whose trade with them was disrupted) are crying out for justice and an investigation into the criminals. But the clergy are urging us to be gentle, with many silently (and a few vocally) agreeing that this was good and right in Surael's eyes. What says the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 new_sun_cult.216.daelantir:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nMost in [Root.GetName] live lives of duty and diligence, making a meaningful contribution - albeit one likely unknown beyond their village or town. But a few are blessed by Surael with the capacity and luck to do more, to truly make an impact on [Root.GetName]. And one such individual has recently come to our attention.\n\nUnfortunately, he seems to already have found a calling -- as a Ravelian priest, in one of the Ravelian societies that has recently sprung up in [Root.GetName]. We could perhaps convince him to shrug off those black robes he now wears and lend his service to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but the priests insist they cannot shrug off the shadow in their soul that comes from adhering to the whispers of the false One God. And indeed, with a place at court they may convince others of their beliefs.\n\nAn invitation has been drafted to order them to [Root.Capital.GetName] and the court. It lays in front of [Root.Monarch.GetName] -- but so does a raging fireplace. What comes next?"
 new_sun_cult.217.daelantir:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe message is read at night. There is no intent in that fact; it does not reflect any attempt to hide its contents from Surael's burning eye in the skies above. It is merely the consequence of the note's delivery, passed to the [Root.Monarch.GetName] at the end of a long day by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Ravelian advisor. So of course, it is read by candlelight and not sunlight, when [Root.Monarch.GetName] is alone and Surael's priests have all gone to bed. Just coincidence, happenstance.\n\nThe handwriting is elaborate, the paper clearly Konwell's best, but the text itself is short and succinct: "The High Rector, [Z97.Monarch.GetName], requests a delegation from [Root.GetName] attend [Z97.Monarch.GetHerHim] in [Z97.Capital.GetName]." A strange note, an unexpected one -- which leads to a strange possibility, but possibly one rife with potential.\n\nThere is no way the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] attend; the affairs of the state keep [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] busy - and the priests would call for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head. But if we wish to show the High Rector our favour, and that we are paying attention to the Ravelian cause, [Root.Heir.GetName] could lead an elaborate delegation. The trip would undoubtedly be good for our scion, a learning opportunity to train them for the day they take the throne. Alternatively, of course, we could just send a token delegation, without any [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] representation. Or should we do as those sleeping priests would undoubtedly suggest if they knew of the affairs transpiring here, and simply discard the letter and forget the High Rector's invitation?"
 new_sun_cult.218.daelantir:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe delegation arrived at [Z97.Capital.GetName] and assumed it would be akin to any diplomatic affair with another state: the exchange of pleasantries, perhaps some boring meetings, a ball or two if one was fortunate. They were wrong; deeply wrong.\n\nInstead, a select few saw themselves blindfolded, led by a small group of Veridicals to a chamber ensconced in the Rectorate's bowels. When they opened their eyes, they were near-blinded by the bright and iridescent light swirling in front of them, shades of green and blue and colours that seemed to lay beyond what a human can see. Within the light, they could see little but the edges of a multi-faceted geometric shape, and yet they sensed the power and weight of the object in front of them. Undoubtedly, they were bearing witness to the God Fragment itself.\n\nAnd then the Fragment spoke. The last shard of the One God - the only god to have ever resided in Halann - reverberated in the room and in their ears and in their souls. What it said (as translated by the High Rector and the Veridicals, of course) our representatives are not willing to share, even after pressures - subtle and not-so-subtle - from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. But we can be certain that whatever the revaluation was, it was a weighty one, for they have one and all converted to Ravelianism, swearing that God is One and the God Fragment is the last remaining piece of that One God. Whispers of their words and this new-found faith have spread around the court like a wildfire, and undoubtedly percolating beyond as well. It is an honour, of course, that men of [Root.GetName] could witness such an event. But it might be a threat as well."

Indeed, it could have been some complex enchantment spell, and they would not be able to know the difference. Eventually, they were ushered from the room, the Veridicals' expression - sheepish? confused? Frustrated? - hidden in their black robes' cowls.\n\nThe High Rector insisted that it was an honour even to gaze upon the Fragment; that who are we to question whether a God turns Its face towards us or not, that its will is not for us to understand.

They have been hard years, with many crises and wars that have severely affected our people, and one of the causes of our continued struggle is the prohibition that Jexis established because of her delusions and that the holy Taelarios maintained. Humans are incapable of mastering magic, they said, naming the atrocities committed by the magi prior to Jaher's arrival. But during Jaher's rule, humans were allowed to use magic, and they worked side by side with the Chosen in the development of new spells and techniques, following the Jaherian Statute on the use of Magic.\n\nHowever, times change, and magic is increasingly a necessity if we want to remain independent. The clergy will not agree, and our neighbors will look at us with suspicious eyes, but perhaps magic is a power that we Bulwari can, must, and need to master.\n\nThere is a word that reflects what we need to do: Šubad.\n\n’Reclaim what is ours’."

When the enemy found him, they tried to kill him, but he simply would not die. His wish had bound him to life. Forever living with the power of the Wish, but never being able to utter one ever again. The new rulers of Bulwar buried him alive at the edge of the Salahad desert, where he remains until this day.\n\nThe szal-Ardeth have guarded that tomb for millennia, but apparently the meteor opened up a passage into it they never knew existed.

But one of our scholars notes that genies’ enchantments rely on strict wording, and thus has remarked there may be a flaw in Amussu’s magic here -- we must lose soldiers, but there is no need to lose men.
