 xhazobkult_events.2.t:0 "A Kult of Many Faces"
 xhazobkult_events.2.d:0 "As the saying goes, ask ten different gnolls what the Xhazobkult is and you will get eleven different answers. This is what the Xhazobkult truly is; a collection of folk traditions, rituals and practices rather than an organized religion. However, such details escape the civilized world. To them the Xhazobkult is merely a bastion of demon worship with no nuance or cultural history.\n\nAs we progress down the path towards joining the civilized world perhaps it would be best for us to abandon the more demonic elements of our faith.\n\nOur nation has long integrated elements of the so-called "civilized religions", and a public conversion to one of these faiths could enhance our standing in the world." 
 xhazobkult_events.2.a:0 "Let us embrace the power of the Khet. For Elikhet!"

 xhazobkult_events.100.t:0 "Gnolls Do Their Own Ritual"
 xhazobkult_events.100.d:0 "Urgent news, a pack of impatient gnolls in [event_province.GetName] have gathered some menials in order to enact a sacrifice of their own, they are already performing the initial rituals to prepare a pyre. Some have even taken to gorging their thirst for blood on a few hapless sacrifices.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must act quickly and decide on what to do with these unruly gnolls, as any sign of doubt and weakness could be a bad omen before a sacrifice."
 xhazobkult_events.100.a:0 "Let the ritual continue."
 xhazobkult_events.100.c:0 "I decide when sacrifices are made!"
 xhazobkult_events.19.t:0 "Portal Opens in $PROVINCENAME$!"
 xhazobkult_events.19.d:0 "Screams echo throughout the steppes as gnolls cackle and fight in brutal frenzies around the flaming pyre. The gigantic fire sends clouds of acrid black smoke filled with the stench of burning flesh. The grandiose sacrifice continues for hours and the frenzy does not let up. In fact, more sigils are drawn with the blood of murdered gnolls and hapless slaves, many gnolls seem possessed by demonic entities and throw themselves to the fire. Soon, those overseeing the events realize that something is awry. The veil between this world and the next is thinned by the unholy suffering of the Sacrifices.\n\nThe sight of a writhing black mass appearing in the center of the pyre sends a chill down their spine, a cacophony of terrified cackles from gnolls whose frenzy turned to terror rings out along with the unimaginable sound of reality tearing itself asunder while monstrosities claw an opening through the mass and begin pouring out of it, murdering and devouring everything in their path."
 xhazobkult_events.19.a:0 "Ugh, deal with them!"
 

 
 xhazobkult_events.1100.t:0 "Build a Pyre in $PROVINCENAME$"
 xhazobkult_events.1100.d:0 "Our shamans have found that [Root.GetName] would be a great area for a sacrifice to Xhazob, The veil between this plane and the hells is thin there, and It could more easily grant us the boons we desire as we bring fire and death to the weak in Its name.\n\nPyres are time-consuming projects. Beyond the inordinate amount of wood needed to properly host the sacrifices, other complexities are often added by gnolls; complex shapes representing sigils of Xhazob and Its demonic hordes are drawn in the blood of many, wooden statues of the gnollish warlords who have brought the sacrifices are put atop pillars so Xhazob may know who spreads death and blood in Its name and rich gnolls create extravagant pieces of architecture amidst the pyre so their names may be known."
 xhazobkult_events.1100.a:0 "This is a fine place, prepare the pyre."
 xhazobkult_events.1100.b:0 "Find another spot!"
 xhazobkult_events.1101.t:0 "Gathered Sacrifices from $PROVINCENAME$"
 xhazobkult_events.1101.d:0 "We have rounded up a variety of weaklings from $PROVINCENAME$ whose souls can be readily given to Xhazob to do as It pleases with them. Their terrible suffering and fiery deaths will bring to us the blessings of the demonic planes."
 xhazobkult_events.1101.a:0 "More for the Fires."
 xhazobkult_events.1101.b:0 "Hide these events until next time gathering sacrifices"
 xhazobkult_events.1102.t:0 "The Pyre Burns!"
 xhazobkult_events.1102.d:0 "Finally, after months of preparation, the sacrifices are tied to their posts. Some weep, some simply look down and accept their fate. The crowds of gnolls cackle in ecstatic merriment as they watch a warlord bring a torch to the wood. The blood of the sigils drawn on the pyre quickly light up, the flames slowly creep up towards the weak and soon screams of pain and terror echo throughout the steppes.\n\nA sickly haze permeates the scene as the veil between our plane and Xhazob’s weakens. The gnolls feel an unholy power course through their bodies and frenzied dances and fights ensue. Sigils are drawn while gnolls bathe themselves with the blood of the weak. Those most taken by the demonic frenzy twist into stronger shapes or die trying. The harnessed powers of our Demonic overlords must now be directed at the weak who defy us."
 xhazobkult_events.1102.a:0 "Death, blood and pain in the name of Xhazob!"
 xhazobkult_events.3000.t:0 "Hellfire Extinguished…"
 xhazobkult_events.3000.d:0 "The [Root.xhaz_gender_tt] is dead, their infernal flame burns no longer! The Xhazob to which they played host has returned to the outer planes and has not seen fit to grace [Root.Monarch.GetName] with the same demonic gifts granted to their sire.\n\nWithout the blessings of the Xhazob it is unclear if [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be able to hold on to vast empire the [Root.xhaz_gender_tt] had established. Already, rebellious elements among the conquered peoples are beginning to cause chaos and gather their forces, supported by foreign powers seeking to "liberate them from evil"..."
 xhazobkult_events.3000.a:0 "Bah, let them try, they will all burn!"
 xhazobkult_events.3001.t:0 "Something Wicked This Way Comes"
 xhazobkult_events.3001.d:0 "The roar of the pyre, the beating of the drums, the screams of the sacrifices, cackling laughter. A sinister symphony rings out across the vast camp, gnolls gathered in their tens of thousands to witness the birth of the next [Root.xhaz_gender_tt].\n\nFor days now they have cavorted, slaughtered and feasted amongst the many concentric circles of hellish green pyres that make up the ritual site. Lesser demons have crawled forth from these smaller pyres to join the carnage, summoned by the vile celebrations of the horde.\n\nIn the centre of this orchestra of sin lies the grand pyre unto which [Root.Monarch.GetName] has spent the last week casting thousands of sacrifices to their fiery doom. Their red-rimmed eyes flicker with madness as a dry cackle escapes their bloodstained maw. In a frenzy they turn upon one of the assembled shamans who have been aiding them, ripping out their throat with fang and claw. In a flash of blinding speed [Root.Monarch.GetName] has slain five  more of their number. Those that survive begin to flee but [Root.Monarch.GetName] snaps out a command in an unearthly tongue, compelling the shamans to turn and attend to them.\n\nThe six bodies of the slain shamans are thrown into the flames before [Root.Monarch.GetName] beckons over the ensorcelled survivors. Wordlessly they begin to bind the supplicant in blackened ironwood chains. [Root.Monarch.GetName] grins manically as they are trussed up and thrown into the pyre themselves. Silence descends briefly over the camp. All of Halann seems to hold its breath for a moment in time.\n\nThe earth shudders. A deafening explosion rocks the area. Blinding green light flares as the central pyre explodes outwards, engulfing those gathered around it. Luminous, blazing green eyes appear within the oily blackness of the smoke. A rumbling cackle echoes for miles around. [Root.Monarch.GetName] emerges from the darkness, their body monstrously swollen and warped by the demonic power of the Xhazob that now dwells within them, hellfire trailing in their wake.\n\nThe horde erupts into screams of exultation; for many miles around crops begin to wither and cattle keel over, spewing burning black bile. A [Root.xhaz_gender_tt] stalks the mortal world once more."
 xhazobkult_events.3001.a:0 "All Halann trembles before the [Root.xhaz_gender_tt]!"
 xhazobkult_events.3002.t:0 "Wrath of the Xhazob"
 xhazobkult_events.3002.d:0 "Silence falls over the host of warriors and celebrants gathered to witness the birth of the new Xhazobine. Not a whisper is heard across the grand camp; all await the outcome with bated breath. The calm before the storm.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] but moments ago threw themselves into the grand pyre at the centre of the camp, the apex of a week-long orgy of violence and debauchery in which sacrifices had been made to the great demonic spirit. Despite the scale of the event,  it must be said that the shamans have been uneasy about the relatively paltry offerings [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been able to gather.\n\nThe silence is broken. Not by a roar of triumph, but a scream of terror. Writhing in agony, [Root.Monarch.GetName] emerges from the flames burnt and twisted, held in the titanic jaws of a monstrous creature of shadow and flame. So incensed by this meagre sacrifice is the Xhazob that the mighty demon seeks to punish the upstart gnolls directly. \n\nDays later, the few survivors would describe the Xhazob wreaking an unspeakable slaughter upon the assembled horde, annihilating our leadership and leaving our armies in total disarray. Our realm is on the brink of disintegration and the many lesser packs held together by (dead monarch name) are already gathering their forces to try and seize power or break away."
 xhazobkult_events.3002.a:0 "A curse on [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 xhazobkult_events.3003.t:0 "Survival of the Fittest"
 xhazobkult_events.3003.d:0 "It would seem that the Xhazob with whom [Root.Monarch.GetName] struck a pact has been making deals with other gnollish leaders, and one of them has been chosen as the Xhazob's host.\n\nOur own erstwhile Xhazobine has not been so lucky. On the night before the latest Great Xhaz was declared, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s profane brand ignited into emerald hellfire. A great bestial form spewed forth from their brow, tethered by a tendril of flame. The primal spirit of the Xhazob engulfed our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who died screaming in agony. Not even ash was left when the flames finally flickered out.\n\nOur realm is in disarray, and to add insult to injury, many of our warriors have already abandoned us and flocked to the banners of the new Xhazobine. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has failed us!"
 xhazobkult_events.3003.a:0 "We can only hope to weather the coming storm."
