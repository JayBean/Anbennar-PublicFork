 A60_gamblers_paradise_desc: "Ravenhill is already home to a large number of gambling houses and other establishments of ill repute, and they generate much income for us.

We will consider their debt paid if they go out into the swamp and aid in the resettlement."
 A60_flooded_coast_title: "Control the Flooded Coast"
 A60_flooded_coast_desc: "Now that we are starting to reclaim the folly for our nation, we should focus first on securing the coastal regions, which contains both the old city of Corveld and the estuary of the Dostanesck River, both of which will be helpful to exerting further control over the swamps."

 A60_redistricting_ravenhill_desc: "Ravenhill, for centuries, has been a border city on the edge of a dark swamp, filled with less reputable members of society. It had to adapt to its position, and thus the city itself has a strange, lopsided layout and setup. Now, Ravenhill finds itself in a central position, surrounded by newly founded farmland and villages. Due to its considerable size already, it will likely become a major urban hub of the region. And thus, as it had to adapt to the swamp in ages past, it must adapt once more to what it shall become. We will redistrict the city, and hopefully turn it into the shining star of the region. First, we will need to make the city much more attractive to the upper class..."
 A60_relocate_government_title: "The Ravenhill Question"
 A60_relocate_government_desc: "The redistricting of the city was a success and the city is starting to grow to great heights. With its rapidly growing population, importance, and central location, perhaps we should move the central government to Ravenhill?"

The Commoners and the rich alike gather in gambling houses still, while artisans produce their myriad goods all throughout the city.

 A60_pale_light_of_corvuria_mission_desc: "A Powerful piece of propaganda is being spread throughout Asheniande and Corvuria; a play titled "The Pale Light of Corvuria". The play calls for the unification of Corvuria under the House of the Pale Raven, and highlights both the prosperity of Asheniande superimposed on the more dour circumstances Corvuria has found itself in.

We should seek to gain the support of the electors, and perhaps even utilize the other resources available to us..."
 A60_blood_court_title: "The Blood Court"
 A60_blood_court_desc: "Working alongside vampires is risky business, as there is no official law or organization that controls them, and many are just as liable to collude with you as they are to act in heinous ways that subvert secrecy and order.

We will create the first international community of vampires... The Blood Court."

 A60_into_lencenor_desc: "Our ruler holds the crowns of Arannen, Corvuria, Asheniande, and Anbennar itself in their possession. We shall prepare for our next venture in politics and war, and set our sights on Lencenor, the land of roses and wine. Many options lie open for us, some of them diplomatic, others, somewhat less so."
 A60_ashen_rose_title: "The Ashen Rose"
 A60_ashen_rose_desc: "We have prepared long enough. It is now time for our march into Lencenor. First, our rule will spread over Roilsard, the origin of our great dynasty.

If we are to restore this land to functional use then this lingering curse must be dealt with by the magic of today."
 A60_rebuild_rivers_title: "Rebuild River Trade"
 A60_rebuild_rivers_desc: "The Karnvord River has served as the perfect channel of trade into the heart of Corvuria, and along with the smaller rivers around it makes for a perfect system of trade routs across the region.
