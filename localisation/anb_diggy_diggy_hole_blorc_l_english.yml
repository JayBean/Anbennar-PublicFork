##### Hold Trophy
blorc.1.t:0 "A Gate Left Open"
blorc.1.desc:0 "The Dwarves of Khugdihr were famous for standing stalwart and unharmed as our kin first invaded the western holds. Blocked off from the eastern road by a huge collapse which consumed the hold of Ovdal Asra millennia ago, it was broken down by Gurukk Siegebreaker in 1424, beginning the Greentide. Now the city holds no treasures but the vaults themselves and a vast gate leading out into Escann, for it has been stripped bare by the thousands that have passed through it. Still, it is a shame to have such vaults lie empty when they could be filled with the wealth of our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. The followers of Korgus Dookanson have abandoned the mountains for the lands of the humans, leaving Khugdihr to serve us as a staging ground to plunder further beyond!"
blorc.1.a:0 "We may need to build more treasuries, soon!"

blorc.2.t:0 "The Platinum Scourge"
blorc.2.desc:0 "Unlike the dwarven forges found in other holds throughout the Serpentspine, the workshops and warehouses of Haraz Orldhûm have their walls lined with shackles and chains to hold the slaves that worked them. Goblin and dwarven workers carved out layer after layer of this place, kept from the glory of combat and forced to labour for their masters' enrichment. But they would not be slaves forever. Our kin knew that power ultimately fell to the hands of the strongest, and the complacent slave masters were not able to withstand successive slave revolts, weakening their strength sufficiently so that the orcish might triumph. Little did the insurgents know that their fate would not change under orcish rule, as they were dragged along in warbands all across the Dwarovar.\n\nDespite the devastation, not all was ransacked from this proud hold; the chains and cages can be used for our own gains against the pathetic squatters who dare defy [Root.Owner.GetName]."
blorc.2.a:0 "One day, all the Serpentspine shall be shackled the same."

blorc.3.t:0 "The Broken Crown"
blorc.3.desc:0 "We have fought the dwarves for so long that the days when they were actually organised together, rather than dying alone, are merely held in our shamans' myths. There is one truth we know, however: when they were unified, it was under the central control of the largest hold in the entire Serpentspine: Amldihr. Situated in the centre of the Serpent’s Vale, it was where every dwarf came to discuss matters of the empire.\n\nNow in ruins, their grand halls lie empty with only crumbling statues and weathered carvings suggesting this was a place of the greatest importance to them. Yet only a fraction of the ruins have been scoured of their vast treasures; who knows what still lies here?"
blorc.3.a:0 "The Age of Dwarves is over. The Time of the Orc has come."

blorc.4.t:0 "The Triumph of the North"
blorc.4.desc:0 "The campaigns we led against the dwarves in the frigid northern wastes outside the Giant’s Anvil of Krakdhûmvror were long, arduous undertakings. They brought the forces of our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to conflict with some of the most bloodthirsty and determined dwarves we've ever fought, cloaked in an almost servile cold that, at times, threatened to slow our unrelenting charge into their precious capital.\n\nThere is much to behold of this place we have conquered; as its inhabitants were unusually unrelenting and stalwart, they protected their home with their famed ice-steel structures and weaponry which now is set into our hands. Yet, we walk away with something infinitely more precious: the legacy of our triumph over the elements themselves."
blorc.4.a:0 "Let us celebrate... in a less desolate part of the Serpentspine"

blorc.5.t:0 "Rusting Knowledge"
blorc.5.desc:0 "The Hold of Dûr-Vazhatun, once a scholarly centre of the dwarves, has lain in ruins for millennia, rusting and decaying. Now, it has fallen into our hands, and within it, our armies have found a vast number of surprising discoveries. A gigantic room, lined with shelves upon shelves of mostly useless books. Large workshops, filled with various objects, contraptions of glass and tubes, rusted machinery, gears, and cogs. Most strange of all, at the top of the hold, a room of shattered glass and a rusted dome that opens onto the peak of the mountains.\n\nThese damned dwarves have always used their books, guns, and machinery against us, and even when the dwarves themselves are long gone, their incomprehensible machines often pose obstacles blocking our goals. However, throughout these workshops and among the shelves of books, there are schematics and instructions, filled with drawings of stars and strange figures, and not simply scratched in their cursed language. Our shamans have been greatly interested in the schematics and charts, deeming themselves to understand much more than the dwarves that once lived in these halls."
blorc.5.a:0 "The more we conquer the more we learn, the more we learn the more we conquer!"

blorc.6.t:0 "Lambs to the Slaughter"
blorc.6.desc:0 "Plenty of dwarves would tell the stories of charges through the interior of the mountain, and across the vast reaches of the Serpent’s Vale and Northern Pass. Rams and riders clad in ramsteel pushing back any attempt at intrusion to their empire. They were, however, no match for the strength of the orcs. Our forefathers breached the vale and disposed of their forces, leaving behind the rams that have since been left wandering the wilderness, surviving on their own, providing us with plenty of the tastiest mutton from their lambs and ewes. Whether stewed, roasted or boiled they make a fine delicacy, and help both our warriors and our young ones grow fast and strong."
blorc.6.a:0 "The [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] shall eat lamb tonight!"

blorc.7.t:0 "An Armoured Vanguard"
blorc.7.desc:0 "Honours and treasures aplenty end up in the hands of those soldiers who first set foot inside of a newly conquered hold, whether due to ritual or circumstance. Here though the orcish vanguard was especially well rewarded, as many of them claimed a set of mithril armour from the plundered remains of the captured armoury in Mithradhûm. Now as long as these orcs or their descendants serve in our armies, the tip of every lance and the blade of every sword will be turned aside by our front-most troops, giving us still greater successes on the battlefield."
blorc.7.a:0 "We were unstoppable before. But this shall make things a bit smoother."

blorc.8.t:0 "The Dagrite Heart"
blorc.8.desc:0 "Er-Natvir, the logistical centre of the Dwarovar, only stood for a short time as an affront to the will of Dookan and the righteous mandate we hold over the dwarves. Like a failing heart, it pumped the necessary goods that kept the bleeding corpse that was Aul-Dwarov alive for as long as it did, defiant to keep itself and its vestigial holds alive, only to prolong its own suffering.\n\nHaving now occupied the railyard, we are in full control of the heart and its assembly line. Our forces have made this iron heart into a staging ground of orcish design, giving us the means necessary to run amok through its veins."
blorc.8.a:0 "With every beat of the heart, we shall conquer more of the Serpentspine."

blorc.9.t:0 "A Fated Encounter"
blorc.9.desc:0 "Verkal Kozenad was the second hold to fall when we burst out of Hul-Jorkad and showed all the Serpentspine our might. Now we have again taken this old hold, and though our ancestors were quite successful in looting it, we have managed to find a few more trophies that they missed. In a hidden stash room we have found many grapples and ropes along with crowbars and looking glasses littering the area; we assume these to be old equipment, used for espionage and breaking into places in far reaches. As one of our soldiers tried using the grapple on a ledge inside the room, they pulled down a crate of prized black opals which crashed on the floor, scattering the contents around. Who knows how many other hidden stashes lie within the hold?"
blorc.9.a:0 "What suspiciously good luck…"

blorc.10.t:0 "A Song in the Soul"
blorc.10.desc:0 "The Dwarovar is ours, and orcs can be found across the Serpentspine. But if there is anything we share, anything that thrums through all of us, it is rooted in Hul-Jorkad. To own that hold, to ensure the dwarves are forever expunged from its halls, their mighty walls torn down and their deep dungeons destroyed; this somehow speaks to the very nature of every orc. And with that done, we shall be even more united in our Dookan-given purpose."
blorc.10.a:0 "We are renewed in our purpose."

blorc.11.t:0 "Mirror Mirror…"
blorc.11.desc:0 "Upon entering the vast central square of the upper level of Orlghelovar, we noticed how strangely bright it was, even without a single lit up torch in sight. Looking up, some of our orcs were nearly blinded by stray beams of light that scattered between mirrors in a strange pattern, some leading to a window of a ruined structure, while others led to peculiar spots on the vast square. They spotlighted great unkempt trees and other flora, still growing in these depths despite there being no sign of other life.\n\nSo long have these old inventions functioned despite the death of their makers millennia ago, maintaining such vegetation which has no business surviving in such a desolate place. While we wreak havoc on our most hated enemies, life still continues to thrive and reclaims the remains left behind."
blorc.11.a:0 "Perhaps not every ruin is so bleak after all?"

blorc.12.t:0 "Misplaced Priorities"
blorc.12.desc:0 "When we made our way into the marble hold of Shazstundihr, amidst broken statues and defaced marble arches, we found a few structures still remaining. A mausoleum which while certainly worse for wear, showed the great importance of ancestors in dwarven societies. Yet as they erected such large statues and tributes to them, what have they done in return? Spending such large amounts of effort on the dead rather than the strengthening of oneself seems baffling to us - are their ancestors proudly looking down upon them as their hold lies in ruins?\n\nCrushing this last remnant will serve as a reminder that the achievements of an ancestor will never translate to the achievements of their descendent, to both the dwarves and ourselves. May we spend our time on the betterment of our next generations rather than the veneration of dry bones."
blorc.12.a:0 "Their marble will forever be stained by their own blood."

blorc.13.t:0 "The Husk of a Dead Age"
blorc.13.desc:0 "Amidst the heaving death of the empire of the dwarves, there was, for a time, a singular beacon of hope among the dwarves: Arg-Ôrdstun. Not even the most fanatical of our brethren, for a time, could break through its formidable defences, forcing us back to retreat and rethink time and time again. The dwarves of the place grew defiant, proud, comfortable even in the false pretence that — so long as the walls stood — Arg-Ôrdstun and her peoples were safe, even if it meant they were to be the last of their kind.\n\nOur defilement of this place was done with great prejudice and pleasure, the husk of this ruined hold serving as a reminder to all, orcs or otherwise, that it is not a case of if, but when we will bring all the Serpentspine to its knees."
blorc.13.a:0 "A new age for the Serpentspine has begun. Our age."

blorc.14.t:0 "Armed and Ready"
blorc.14.desc:0 "A strange sight beset us as we entered the ruins of Verkal Skomdihr, an eerie presence which haunted the vast empty halls and lit abandoned rooms with strange lights. It has however not stopped us from raiding the armouries, where we found large stockpiles of flintlock rifles and gunpowder barrels, still in working condition to be wielded by our troops. Though we've taken trophies from every dwarven band that broke before us, this size of a stockpile had left us worried, for we feared it had to do with the land beyond the surface gate... the Deepwoods themselves.\n\nSome believed it to be a land of even more opportunities, a bountiful land full of magical treasures, a hunting grounds to give young ones practice, while some have feared it more than anything they had seen before. Our bounties are large, yet our opportunities are larger, a choice has arisen, whether to reach into the deepwoods or save ourselves the trouble.."
blorc.14.a:0 "We will use these better than their previous owners ever could."

blorc.15.t:0 "Ending Orcrend’s Legacy"
blorc.15.desc:0 "The conquest of Ovdal Lodhum left many a banner trampled in the mud. But they did fight fiercely, better-trained and with more discipline than most dwarves we had crushed before us. We forced our way through a tunnel inundated with burning pitch, savaged their forces that used strange crystal lights for tunnel fighting. They gave us no quarter, and were commendably brutal in their fighting — but they fell, like all dwarves shall before orcish blade.\n\nIt is only in seizing the hold's deepest reaches that we begin to see the reason behind their impressive showing. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] came across, in a place of high honour, a blade of blue steel stained deep with blood, a blade known to every orc, one that features in the scary stories we tell our children and even an adult's nightmares. The blade Orcrend, once wielded by the one they called "The Trickster", who slew thousands upon thousands of orcs and never fell in turn to our axe or spear. It seems he was indeed a man, and not just a ghost or spectre, and must have settled in this hold.\n\nBut the time where orcs were killed is past, now it is time for orcs to do the killing. Orcrend shall be taken to an anvil, and hammered by the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] until it shatters. We have slain a nightmare, and all orcs shall breath easier for it."
blorc.15.a:0 "[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] shall sleep well tonight."

blorc.16.t:0 "Braving Burning Battles"
blorc.16.desc:0 "The tunnels and caverns of the Serpentspine have always been hostile to anyone who traversed them, yet the constrained spaces and desolate rock is a good whetstone for our strength and fury. But never have we found a place where the land itself seemed to oppose our war as keenly as when taking Gor Bûrad.\n\nWe felt the heat as soon as we approached. Much of the magma from the volcano formed large streams on the interior and exterior of the hold, causing traversal to be particularly difficult yet not impossible.\n\nBut only for a moment.Our fury and ferocity burns hotter than even molten rock; the hold could not hold us off forever. And the lessons we learned in taking it shall ensure that all the others fall quicker as well."
blorc.16.a:0 "Now that we have conquered the lava... can we cook on it?"

blorc.17.t:0 "A Vault Like None Other"
blorc.17.desc:0 "After finally breaching the reinforced walls of Gor Vazumbrog, we began to scour for any plunder and weapons hidden within the labyrinthian inner fortifications. Yet as we reached further into the depths, we asked ourselves whether this formidable strength served to safeguard against external threats or to confine the secrets within? After some time of scavenging, we began to find only grand hallways with bones scattered around openings of large vaults, along with practically unblemished metal golems lying dormant along the walls. With so much plunder lying around with no collapsed tunnels, why has this place been avoided?\n\nThe ominous air that hangs stagnant has left our soldiers unsteady and fearful of what may lie deeper within these halls, but can this really stop us from taking what we deserve? Whatever creature or cursed artefact uncovered must be far gone by now, search every nook and cranny of this forsaken prison!"
blorc.17.a:0 "Nevertheless, it is best to leave the sealed vaults undisturbed."

blorc.18.t:0 "Nonsensical Designs"
blorc.18.desc:0 "Exploring the ruins of Hehodovar was quite the odd experience for our warriors, for the layout of many buildings boggled their minds. Walking down a long and winding hallway led us to a room seemingly designed for one use: the intricate design of ...benches? Hundreds of papers lay scattered across the entire room, detailing the perfect craftsmanship and undying passion for creating the best imaginable. To what end have the utterly insane dwarves driven themselves in this room!\n\nOur attempts to burn this wretched place has made us notice that the stone dared not crack nor the papers begin to catch fire. To no degree have our attempts to cleanse this place sufficed; it must be sealed and never opened ever again. May all these absurd ideas die with their creator."
blorc.18.a:0 "..What did we just witness?"

blorc.19.t:0 "Further Beyond"
blorc.19.desc:0 "Seghdihr, and the Segbandal they led, fought our ancestors to a stand-still as they tried to enter the Middle Serpentspine. But we are not our ancestors: we are stronger, fiercer, tougher. We would ask the Citrine Dwarves if that has been made clear to them, but living ones are few and far between within the hold's halls nowadays — corpses, of course, still litter the ground everywhere.\n\nWe will, however, undoubtedly see that truth in the eyes of those who deal with us, the cowardice of those would would oppose us — whatever stopped orcs before, wherever we were held back, it shall not survive the [Root.Owner.GetName] onslaught."
blorc.19.a:0 "There is terror in the caverns and tunnels. We shall not stop."

blorc.20.t:0 "The Grandest Display"
blorc.20.desc:0 "The Dwarovar is a rich land, one that has been plundered for thousands of years. But nothing there compares to the treasury of Verkal Gulan, big enough that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] could be fully submerged within.\n\nIt is enough to give every soldier double the pay, fulfil the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s wildest dreams, with plenty left over. And as for that remainder's use? Let it be displayed beneath the seat of our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle], an exhibit of our wealth to make any envious of, to put shame into the eyes of every hoarder for they may never achieve such riches. For what reason would the dwarves even dare to hide this all in a locked treasury when every eye can witness their grand opulence? Gold is meant to be admired, not left to dull in dark vaults."
blorc.20.a:0 "..Can we even fit this all in one room?"

blorc.21.t:0 "Breaking Dwarven Will"
blorc.21.desc:0 "Of the many holds that have fallen, Gor Ozumbrog is the youngest to have been created. The topaz gem that represented their unbreakable will had yet to become as lustrous as those of Seghdihr or Arg-Ôrdstun, fading to irrelevance as the Segbandal and the sun elves shattered the hold’s walls and left their inhabitants to be slaughtered by goblins. Their pathetic attempts to remain alive left them as refugees in neighbouring holds, where their wills eroded among the fellow cowards who hid in their homes as their kin died around them.\n\nFor even the strongest wills cannot begin to rival our strength and ferocity; let the conquest of their hold send a message that [Root.Owner.GetName] will destroy any dwarf who dares to go against us."
blorc.21.a:0 "Bloodthirsty we may be, yet in battle, we seize victory utterly."

blorc.22.t:0 "Forged by Fire"
blorc.22.desc:0 "The guns of Ovdal Kanzad took their toll. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] knew they would when [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] sent the forces against its walls. The massive batteries that manned its gates produced booms that could be heard from leagues away, and the forces that ultimately took it had climbed over vast piles of orcish corpses to get there.\n\nBut the deed is done. Ovdal Kanzad has fallen. And we have learned a thing or two about enduring unrelenting cannonfire in the process."
blorc.22.a:0 "The guns fell. We did not."

blorc.23.t:0 "A Welcome Conquest"
blorc.23.desc:0 "As our armies marched into the vanquished Hold of Grôzumdihr, they noticed a strange gate at its entrance, with Dwarven words inscribed in a strangely-lit green stone. It seemed not worth the effort to pry those jewels from their place, and so when one of the more learned shamans with some understanding of that strange tongue entered, she could decipher some of what it said.\n\nThis revealed an odd discovery; it looks that this hold welcomes all? It was inevitable, of course, but the dwarves are strange to have invited it. Perhaps that is why they fell so easily.\n\nTheir seeming disposition did mean our looting was somewhat less violent than usual, which left a strange set of papers unburned, and unshredded. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has claimed them for [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], and only time will tell what [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] may learn from them."
blorc.23.a:0 "If it is not interesting reading material, it shall serve fine as kindling."

blorc.24.t:0 "The Slavers' Head"
blorc.24.desc:0 "Ovdal-az- n, once a hold of dwarven theocrats, then the greatest goblin hold, has finally fallen. As it fell, our orcs swarmed the throne room more ferociously than ever before, as these goblins had committed a great crime to our kin. The goblins here had the audacity to keep our brethren as slaves, forcing them to mine the depths of the hold and sending them further east to cowardly buyers.\n\nThe head of the goblin who ruled this hold is brought to our [From.Monarch.GetTitle], an immensely forgettable goblin but his head will serve as reminder to the enslaved remnants of their clan when they take our brothers' place in the mines."
blorc.24.a:0 "They shall work as hard as the holds' hogs, or they shall feed them."

blorc.25.t:0 "Worthier Brews"
blorc.25.desc:0 "The barrels of Dwarovar Dark we've seized from the dwarves in our conquests have left a couple of our eager orcs dead, as rumour has it that only a dwarven stomach can handle the brew.. But we, on the other hand, have been deadly to dwarves, and we need a brew that'll match that trait. Now that we have control of their old breweries, we can begin to make our own drinks to surpass the old black tar that was Dwarovar Dark.\n\nWith a few changes in the recipe we can create less deadly and frankly better tasting ale than the filth created by the dwarves, with only a few sips our warriors have gained a bloodlust like none other to energise them for our next wars."
blorc.25.a:0 "Drink up! And bring an extra pitcher for the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]!"

blorc.26.t:0 "Structured Service"
blorc.26.desc:0 "For millennia we have forced goblins to serve orcish might, a generous reward when compared to simply slaughtering them and letting their blood water the Serpentspine's caverns. But in taking Tuwad-Dhûmankon and slaying its residents, we have seen evidence of a more concerted effort towards the enslaving of these creatures.\n\nA systematic hierarchy, detailed requirements and tribute payments, precise demands — clearly the Hobgoblins' similarity to their lesser brethren has forced them to be organised in the organisation of their slavery. These should be even more effective when backed by orcish fury, ferocity, and steel, and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] will take a look over what we have found in the hold to see what might be applied to the goblins that serve [Root.Owner.GetName]."
blorc.26.a:0 "Who ever imagined our slaves were worth thinking about?"

blorc.27.t:0 "The Warriors' Whetstone"
blorc.27.desc:0 "We are used to dominating the Dwarovar. Hold walls fall before our onslaught, the dwarves are crushed into the ground they love, while goblins leave a green smear on cavern walls. But the hobgoblins? They reminded us why the Dwarovar is a place of blood and brutal battle, even for us orcs.\n\nTheir solid lines would not break before a mighty charge, even when most would turn and run. Their well-trained soldiers would not shatter before sword and axe and orcish might. Their discipline could withstand bloody losses, and not crumble.\n\nBut they fell, nonetheless. We have taken Grônstunad, the brightest of the holds they rule. And all their solid forces, their impressive armies — well, it has just made an excellent whetstone on which to sharpen the blade of our troops."
blorc.27.a:0 "It's enough to almost pity the next foe to cross us."

blorc.28.t:0 "The Desolate Room"
blorc.28.desc:0 "At the easternmost end of the Serpentspine we have found the dwarves' most well-hidden hold, a bizarre place that unsettled the troops just from being inside it. Our warriors, upon storming the place, were lulled after their conquests into a sleep that was far from natural, with many warriors describing visions that ranged from the crumbling walls of structures that pierced the sky, to sandstorms of night-black sands billowing from the mountains and onto the thirsting earth.\n\nOur shamans took immediate interest in the hold and came to survey it, noting the change in behaviour of the now permanent orc residents who seemed to be a more wary sort than the usual, citing their odd yet not unwelcome dreams as the source of their change. It appeared the root of the mystery, as with all things in the Dwarovar, was buried - this time in the depths of the unconscious mind. Upon rest, they came across something that would change them irreparably: a vision of an empty desolate room, and the sound of chains budging in the distance.\n\nThat vision was just the beginning, however; debates of its meaning have begun to whip up the imagination of our shamans, now interested in uncovering the truths prophesied by the dreams that now live in the minds of the orcish people."
blorc.28.a:0 "Perhaps the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] should visit, what might [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] dream?"

  blorc.50.t:0 "Planning The Ozarm'Chadash"
  blorc.50.d:0 "The Ozarm'Chadash is an ancient tradition in orc society, perhaps even the oldest. In a traditional sense it is a way for the have nots to take from the haves, a means for the strong youth to take from the decaying old. If an orc holds a title, a wife, an axe or even an entire tribe a challenger can duel them for it, risking both lives in the process. A Ozarm'Chadash (Duel For Honor in Orcish) is a fight to the death if the winner decides so, but the loser is occasionally spared by the victor, often for extra humiliation.\n\nIn our case we are planning to challenge one of the minor chieftains occupying one of the decrepid holds in the periphery of our realm. These lesser chiefs who infest their holds never last long in their dog-eat-dog world, meaning they will not refuse, as that is surely the largest sign of weakness in orc society.\n\nWhich chieftain do we challenge?"

As thousands of orcs gather outside the gate to see this duel between the past and the future, [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] sharpens their axe one last time."

However, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was spared. The axe a mere inch from their face, penetrating into the cave-floor. The orcs of [blorc_duel_target.GetName] began chanting the name of their victorious chief, as [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] attempted to get up, heavily bleeding and shamed, and motioned to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men to carry [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] out."
  blorc.53.a:0 "Get me out of here"
  blorc.54.t:0 "A new Chief!"
  blorc.54.d:0 "As the chieftain of [blorc_duel_target.GetName] brought down their axe, splitting the skull of [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] wide open, a silence went through the crowd. Soon the silence broke into cheering coming from [blorc_duel_target.GetName]'s side of the crowd, as the chief claimed the regalia of [Root.Monarch.GetName] for themselves and the personal guard of [Root.Monarch.GetName] began swearing their loyalty to the new $MONARCHTITLE$. As the new $MONARCHTITLE$ began marching towards the capital, with the mutilated head of the old $MONARCHTITLE$ as proof, a new era for the [Root.GovernmentName] ushered in."

  blorc.130.d:0 "The radiating red heat of the gigantic flows of magma were almost unbearable when we finally entered the heart of the hold. Like blood to a heart, these streams of molten rock lead into a gigantic forge, fueled directly by the very stone and earth herself. Gigantic heat-proof pipes carry the slurry to the array of blast furnaces that refine the unimaginable amounts of ore the mines throughout [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] produce. To use these foundries for our purpose would be a blessing, so our top priorit now is to dismantle what we find and carry it over to [Root.Capital.GetName], and rebuild it there, to the best of our ability."
  blorc.130.a:0 "Though it won't be the same without the magma…"
  blorc.131.t:0 "The Artificer Hall"
  blorc.131.d:0 "The battles all throughout the siege of [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] were strange, our enemies fighting with weapons we had never seen before. Their blades and hammers cackled with blue bolts of lightning, it seemed their very armour was infused with magic unlike anything our shamans had ever documented, or even glimpsed of inside Dookan’s omens. At last, however, we have found the source of these unholy contraptions. What seemed to be a strange mixture between scholarly hall and manufacturing plant turned out to be a hub for a new kind of science: Artificery. They people of [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] have created these strange items, and with them also the blueprints to replicate construction."
  blorc.131.a:0 "We'll learn how to use all this, in time."
  
  blorc.132.t:0 "The Grand Manufactory"
  blorc.132.d:0 "The entire hold is stuffed with gears and pipes, endlessly transferring energy and materials back and forth between the different hold levels. Gigantic steam engines whir around every corner, the hot vapor they create is almost oozing out of the pressurized pipes. Fuel for the furnaces rushes through chutes that come from the dark and end in the dark. That is the state we have found [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] in, an immeasurable complex of industrious machinery. Only after entering the lowest level did we find the beating heart of all of these contraptions: Down here, roto-hammers, metal-printers, and auto-lorries churn out dwarven goods at a break-neck speed, entire households of items are created within seconds, all happening automatically. The sound of the hammers and hoists create the beating of this heart."
  blorc.132.a:0 "Take it apart and recreate it in our style back in [Root.Capital.GetName]"
  blorc.133.t:0 "The High Gardens"
  blorc.133.d:0 "In the central chambers of the hold, far removed from the outer fringes, lie a strange and otherworldly sight. Suspended throughout the gigantic chamber are spheres and terraces of fertile soil, garnished with plants, the likes of which we have never seen before. These growths seem to be sustained by glowing orbs attached to lamp posts all over the pillar-lined cavern, dousing it in a warm, yellow glow. The terraces are connected through multitudes of bridges and monorails, pipes have been laid all through the chamber to facilitate efficient irrigation, the water itself is stored in a gigantic overhead tank that is illuminated in a way that it seems to be a facsimile of the sky beyond the dark tunnels of the Dwarovar."
  blorc.133.a:0 "Take the plants and seeds and build one like these in [Root.Capital.GetName]"
  blorc.134.t:0 "The Military Academy"
  blorc.134.d:0 "Racks upon racks upon racks of armour. swords, axes, and battlehammers as far as the eye can see. High-vaulted rooms filled with scale-replicas of the different tunnels and railyards around [blorc_plunder_target.GetName], libraries full of books and scrolls on battle tactics, philosophy of war and stratgeic deployment. The academy sprawling out through the entire hold is a testament to the famous dwarven grudges and goblin strategies, so many rooms and people dedicated to warfare and recruiting armies puts even our warcamps to shame. Such an unthinkable adversary must be destroyed, its secrets must become our strategies such that our war rooms will be the best throughout the entire Serpentspine!"
  blorc.134.a:0 "Take it! Take it all! Burn what we can't take!"

  blorc.150.t:0 "Goblin Hold"
  blorc.150.d:0 "[blorc_plunder_target.GetName] was a goblin hold when we took it, and now that the plundering has begun we can't have them getting in the way. They need to be dealt with."
  blorc.150.a:0 "A good supply of fresh slaves!"
  blorc.150.b:0 "They will be welcome to join us in [Root.Capital.GetName]!"
  blorc.151.t:0 "Dwarf Slaves"
  blorc.151.d:0 "Large amounts of dwarves live in [blorc_plunder_target.GetName], still milling about after their holds has been broken. No matter! Another fresh supply of slaves to work the mines!"
  blorc.151.a:0 "Crack the whip!"
  blorc.152.t:0 "Dwarven Siege Weapon Found!"
  blorc.152.d:0 "Deep in the hold of [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] an experimental battering ram has been found, damaged and half-buried under debris from a partially collapsed ceiling. The local plunderers have taken a liking to the ram and want to bring it to the tunnels and test it on some rocks. In its current condition, however, it might be more useful to just scrap it."
  blorc.152.a:0 "Scrap it for the parts!"
  blorc.152.b:0 "Repair it and put it to use!"
  blorc.153.t:0 "Dwarven Lab Found!"
  blorc.153.d:0 "After hauling hundreds of pieces of a collapsed roof out of a corridor, the plunderers of [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] have discovered an old lab used by the dwarves, with some tools still whole and some documents still partially readable."
  blorc.153.a:0 "Smash it, and sell whatever's valuable!"
  blorc.153.b:0 "We'll try and study it."
  blorc.154.t:0 "Ancient Mural Found!"
  blorc.154.d:0 "Whilst exploring the countless corridors of the hold of [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] the local plunderers have found a mural featuring a battle between orc and dwarf. Our shamans say it is our duty to dig out the mural and move it to one of our holy sites for closer study..."
  blorc.154.a:0 "Dig it out carefully!"
  blorc.154.b:0 "They did not say to dig it out and move it in one piece..."
  blorc.155.t:0 "Lost Ogres"
  blorc.155.d:0 "Ogres wander nearby the looting efforts at [blorc_plunder_target.GetName], sometimes getting in the way of our plundering. What is to be done with them?"
  blorc.155.a:0 "More slaves for our mines!"
  blorc.155.b:0 "Perhaps they can prove their worth on the battlefield."
  blorc.156.t:0 "Mithril Vault Found!"
  blorc.156.d:0 "We have come across a large mithril vault in [blorc_plunder_target.GetName], which has proved difficult to open. The local plunderers have already given up and moved on to easier pickings, but we may want to give it another attempt."
  blorc.156.a:0 "Leave it."
  blorc.156.b:0 "Perhaps some explosives will do the job."
  blorc.156.c:0 "Didn't we have a massive siege weapon lying around somewhere?"



  #generic events
  blorc.200.t:0 "Exceptional Plundering Year!"
  blorc.200.d:0 "The plunderers in [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] have had an exceptional year, digging up far more treasure than we had even thought possible!"
  blorc.200.a:0 "Good!"
  blorc.201.t:0 "Dwarven Statue Found!"
  blorc.201.d:0 "As our plunderers made their way to a new section of [blorc_plunder_target.GetName], they spotted it... An immense statue of a dwarf, towering over the buildings beside it, looking down sternly at the plaza. A grand symbol of dwarven pride, ready to be broken. The only decision that remains to be made is in what direction it should be toppled."
  blorc.201.a:0 "North, onto the offices."
  blorc.201.b:0 "South, onto the guild centre."
  blorc.201.c:0 "East, onto the barracks."
  blorc.202.t:0 "Dwarven Agricultural System Found!"
  blorc.202.d:0 "Our plunderers in [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] have discovered a large, intricate and metal-rich system of pipes, valves, aquifer pumps, noria, aquaducts and sprinklers spanning for many miles deep in the hold. It was apparently used by the dwarves as an agricultural system beyond our comprehension. What is very comprehensible, however, is how all these metals could be put to much better use."
  blorc.202.a:0 "Rip it up!"
  blorc.203.t:0 "Dwarven Museum Found!"
  blorc.203.d:0 "Reports of a dwarven museum in [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] have reached the administration. The plunderers have begun throwing the contents on the loot piles."

  blorc.204.t:0 "Dwarven Forge Found!"
  blorc.204.d:0 "An old forge has been found in [blorc_plunder_target.GetName], with a lot of metal and tools ripe for the taking."

  blorc.205.d:0 "Whilst exploring the countless corridors of the hold of [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] the local plunderers have found a dwarven administrative building. While there isn't much of value to be looted, perhaps all these papers will provide us with some insights into the rest of the hold."
  blorc.205.a:0 "We'll put it to use…"
  blorc.206.t:0 "Dwarven Marketplace Found!"
  blorc.206.d:0 "A large marketplace was found in [blorc_plunder_target.GetName], still filled with loads of useful goods and preserved foods."

  blorc.207.a:0 "Very good!"
  blorc.208.t:0 "Meagre Plunder"
  blorc.208.d:0 "The plunderers in [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] have found far less loot than expected. We've whipped them plenty, but it appears they haven't stolen it for themselves either."
  blorc.208.a:0 "Oh well."
  blorc.209.t:0 "Looting Infrastructure"
  blorc.209.d:0 "There is some impressive infrastructure in [blorc_plunder_target.GetName], from rails and pulley lifts to bridges and sewers. Of course, all built with materials that we can put to good use in the capital!"
  blorc.209.a:0 "Tear them down!"


  blorc.2000.t:0 "Already Ruined Hold"
  blorc.2000.d:0 "It appears that [blorc_plunder_target.GetName] has little of value to be plundered, and as such the plunderers have set up a war camp instead."
  blorc.2000.a:0 "Shame."
