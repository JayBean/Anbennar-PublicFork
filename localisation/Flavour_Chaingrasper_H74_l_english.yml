 chaingrasper_cowing_the_clans_desc:0 "Although Dak has made tremendous progress since uniting the disparate clans under the flag of Chaingrasper, he is still a controversial figure among many goblins: A goblin not only gifted with incredible magical power, but also revolutionary ideas. As many of the minor clans are unlikely to agree with the many reforms he has planned, they will have to be made to see reason one way or another."

 chaingrasper_settling_ovdal-az-an_title:0 "Settling Ovdal-az-Ân"
 chaingrasper_settling_ovdal-az-an_desc:0 "We have lived in the ancient dwarven hold of Ovdal-az-Ân for as long as we can remember, but there are still large parts of the hold unfit for living or inaccessible.

 chaingrasper_freed_from_shackles_desc:0 "The doors to the temple where the ritual was held swung open.

With a booming voice he spoke, and all in Ovdal-az-Ân listened: "I speak to you as $MONARCH$ $DYNASTY$, ruler of this nation forevermore!

 chaingrasper_trapping_the_kariats_desc:0 "Our nation is connected to the lands of Rahen through a cave system called the Kariats.

 chaingrasper_homunculi_assistants_title:0 "Homunculi Assistants"
 chaingrasper_homunculi_assistants_desc:0 "Although any of our subjects would gladly dedicate their lives to $MONARCH$, there are limits to what a mortal can do.

 chaingrasper_enchanted_weaponry_desc:0 "Now that we have secured large quantities of metals, it is time to make use of them: We can make use of our mages to start enchanting weapons on a scale not seen before, equipping a large portion of our army with enchanted weaponry. This will surely give us an edge on the battlefield!"

 chaingrasper_goblin_dominance_title:0 "Goblin Dominance"
 chaingrasper_goblin_dominance_desc:0 "After struggling to survive for centuries, we have finally managed to secure a place for ourselves under the guidance of $MONARCH$.

 chaingrasper_into_the_jade_mines_desc:0 "It is finally time for our struggle against the Command. The Hobgoblins have enslaved our people for far too long, and it is finally time to strike back!"

 chaingrasper_taking_gronstunad_title:0 "Taking Grônstunad"
 chaingrasper_taking_gronstunad_desc:0 "We have pushed east along the roads into Hobgoblin territory, and the hold of Grônstunad is vulnerable: It is their main base of operations within the Serpentspine, and used to serve as the eastern capital of the dwarves. Such a trophy must be ours!"

 chaingrasper_the_eastern_capital_title:0 "The Eastern Capital"
 chaingrasper_the_eastern_capital_desc:0 "Now that we have retaken the hold of Grônstunad, some of our advisors have come to $MONARCH$ with a proposal: By restoring the eastern capital of the dwarven empire of old, we could potentially even move our administration there, benefitting from Grônstunad's infrastructure."

 chaingrasper_a_frontline_hold_title:0 "A Frontline Hold"
 chaingrasper_a_frontline_hold_desc:0 "We have secured the hold of Hul-az-Krakazol, a surface hold precariously close to both the Raj and the Command. We will turn this hold into a veritable fortress, a nightmare for any who would try to enter through its doors."

 chaingrasper_damestear_grenades_title:0 "Damestear Grenades"

 ### Events ###
 flavor_chaingrasper.1.t:0 "The Clock is Ticking"
 flavor_chaingrasper.1.d:0 "Around two decades ago, Dak Chaingrasper unified the disparate clans living around Ovdal-az-Ân under the Chaingrasper flag. Although he has since held the position of Clanboss, Dak knows that his situation will not last forever. Even if he were to survive the perpetually scheming minor clans, he will most likely be gone before the start of the next century.\nAlthough a lesser creature might make peace with their own mortality, Dak will not: In the last decade, he has made great strides in his research of the necromantic arts in the pursuit of immortality. In order to be able to continue leading the Chaingrasper Clan, Dak will do anything necessary to succeed in his quest for power!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.1.a:0 "No matter the cost!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.100.t:0 "HIDDEN EVENT - Finished Studying"
 flavor_chaingrasper.100.d:0 "Notify me if you see this without using the console"
 flavor_chaingrasper.100.a:0 "this removes the study xp bonus"
 flavor_chaingrasper.101.t:0 "A Failed Endeavor"
 flavor_chaingrasper.101.d:0 "With Dak's demise, our nation is starting to fracture. Although the new clanboss is keeping the clans together for now, Dak's grand design seems to have failed, and our future is uncertain. It may only be a matter of time until we are consumed by the threats around us."
 flavor_chaingrasper.101.a:0 "A shame"
 flavor_chaingrasper.102.t:0 "A Successful Endeavor"
 flavor_chaingrasper.102.d:0 "After many decades, his quest has finally succeeded: Dak has successfully become a lich, an immortal creature of great magical power. It is time for the next step in his grand plan: He finally has the power to change the nation however he desires. He will shape order from the chaos of goblin society: All goblins will toil in his name, and in return he will lead them to glory!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.102.a:0 "The beginning of a new era for our nation!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.2.t:0 "Unwanted Guests"
 flavor_chaingrasper.2.d:0 "Although we have made great strides with clearing out previously uninhabitable parts of Ovdal-az-Ân, there seems to be more than just rubble in the bowels of our hold. Many goblins that were taking part in our settling effort have gone missing, and any search parties sent to locate them meet the same fate. However, it seems that we have finally caught the culprit: A few goblins from the latest search party have managed to return, speaking of a dwarven hideout in the depths of our home led by a dwarf who calls himself "Goblinsbane". For the first time since we have settled this hold, we have a chance to attack him before he slips away and continues his reign of terror!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.2.a:0 "Flush him out before he can get away!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.3.t:0 "Goblinsbane is dead!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.3.d:0 "Although they tried to flee at first, our scouts had mapped out most of Ovdal-az-Ân's depths during our resettlement efforts, and they were unable to escape. What followed was a brutal last stand, with collapsed hallways filled with bodies of both goblins and dwarves. In the end, $MONARCH$ himself had to come down to slay Goblinsbane using his magical powers, after which the rest of our troops were able to dispatch his frenzied followers. Now that he is finally gone, we can continue with our efforts to reclaim Ovdal-az-Ân."
 flavor_chaingrasper.3.a:0 "Our people can finally rest easy."
 flavor_chaingrasper.4.t:0 "An Evolving Nation"
 flavor_chaingrasper.4.d:0 "On our journey following Dak's grand plan, our nation has changed considerably. Where at first there were only the squabbling clans, we have grown into an organized state led by $MONARCH$ and his cabal of mages. However, a few of our people have taken to experimenting with magic on their own, calling themselves "artificers". Experimenting like this without our rulers' oversight could be dangerous for both themselves and their surroundings."
 flavor_chaingrasper.4.a:0 "Make an example of the worst offenders!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.400.t:0 "HIDDEN EVENT - Set organization privileges"
 flavor_chaingrasper.400.d:0 "Notify me if you see this without using the console"

 flavor_chaingrasper.5.t:0 "The Artificers Revolt!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.5.d:0 "Although we previously thought that we had taken care of these so-called "artificers", it seems we have underestimated the problem: Many kept practicing in secret, and after a controversial arrest a few weeks prior, tensions have seemingly boiled over. All across our empire, artificers have risen up, openly protesting against our rule!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.5.a:0 "Restore order at any cost!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.6.t:0 "The Sacking of Grônstunad"
 flavor_chaingrasper.6.d:0 "After a long struggle against the Command, we have finally managed to conquer Grônstunad. Now that we finally have control over the heart of the Jade Mines, it is time to decide how to deal with the hobgoblins. We could simply scour the hold of any hobgoblins that chose to inhabit the Jade Hold and resettle it ourselves, or keep a large amount of hobgoblins in order to put them to work."
 flavor_chaingrasper.6.a:0 "Scour the hold!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.6.b:0 "Put the hobgoblins to work!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.7.t:0 "A New Capital"
 flavor_chaingrasper.7.d:0 "A few of $MONARCH$'s advisors have raised the idea of moving our administrative capital to Grônstunad: They argue that the Jade Hold is in a more central position to rule over the Eastern Serpentspine. Furthermore, Grônstunad used to be the eastern capital of the dwarven empire of old, and having it as our capital would no doubt increase our international prestige."
 flavor_chaingrasper.7.a:0 "Grônstunad will be a worthy capital for our empire"
 flavor_chaingrasper.7.b:0 "Our current capital is more than sufficient"
 flavor_chaingrasper.200.t:0 "Raiders from the Serpentspine"
 flavor_chaingrasper.200.d:0 "Recently, many settlements close to the Serpentspine mountains have been pillaged by bands of Goblin raiders. They are almost impossible to track, as they quickly retreat back into the caves after their raids."
 flavor_chaingrasper.200.a:0 "Increase our patrols!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.201.t:0 "The Sacking of Sharaja"
 flavor_chaingrasper.201.d:0 "The goblins of Chaingrasper have sacked our glassblowing workshops, taking most of our tools and documents with them. It will take some time before we can recover from this."
 flavor_chaingrasper.201.a:0 "Those savages!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.202.t:0 "The Sacking of Dhenijansar"
 flavor_chaingrasper.202.d:0 "The goblins of Chaingrasper have sacked the administrative district of Dhenijansar, taking many valuable documents with them. It will take some time before we can recover from this."
 flavor_chaingrasper.202.a:0 "Those savages!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.8.t:0 "Unusual loot"
 flavor_chaingrasper.8.d:0 "A raiding party has returned with some unusual loot: There was a strange house filled with various kinds of scrolls in one of the villages they looted. The raiders nearly torched them all, but one of them identified the scribblings on one of them as being some kind of map. Thinking that they may lead to other locations filled with even more loot, they have returned to Ovdal-az-ân with their bounty in tow. After a quick look, $MONARCH$ quickly deciphered their meaning: These are all maps of various areas of Rahen! With this knowledge, we can one day go much further beyond the caves and loot riches beyond our wildest dreams from Rahen!"
 flavor_chaingrasper.8.a:0 "A different kind of treasure"
