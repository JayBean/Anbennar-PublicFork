 daengun_isolation_disaster:0 "Shattered Peace"
 desc_daengun_isolation_disaster:0 "With the death of King Jeong-Hun, the peace he built in Daengun finds itself under threat. The struggles of the court factions have reached a peak and the kingdom's administration is paralyzed, as competing factions dispatch conflicting orders and many bureaucrats simply refuse to do anything not previously authorized by Jeong-Hun before his death. The Kingdom is in its most precarious position yet and if not handled properly, Odheongu may still return to the civil wars of the Sewengun Period."

 flavor_daengun.1.t:0 "Death of the Peacemaker"
 flavor_daengun.1.d:0 "For generations, a time known as the Sewengun, our land was divided between ethnic kingdoms; the militant §YChimbija§! kingdom of §YGwangang§!, heirs of Guwamuud and masters of the horse; the deeply traditional §YMenjeotaen§! kingdom of §YOndeog§!, descendants of Menjaeng and unmatched bowmen; and the urbanized §YSangsogha§! kingdom of §YDaengun§!, of no great pedigree yet favored by the scholar-bureaucrats for its legal and diplomatic expertise. Yet none were granted the blessing of the spirits, for none were truly the rulers of §YOdheongu§!.\n\nThe reign of Jeong-Hun, King of Daengun, would see an end to this. He would lead Daengun to a quick and decisive victory in the final Sewengun war, proposing a final resolution to the conflict at the following peace conference. Marrying a princess of Ondeog and promising his firstborn son's hand to one of Gwangang, he would see the two rival kingdoms absorbed into Daengun - in the process, gaining the support of the spirits, something unseen since the collapse of Guwaamud, and earning the title Peacemaker.\n\nNow, Jeong-Hun lies on his deathbed and hopes peace shall not die with him."
