 # Railskulker Events
 railskulker.2.t:0 "Engineers Have Come to Help Our Military"
 railskulker.2.d:0 "In order to help our military, we have rounded up some skilled engineers and tinkerers to improve the capabilities of our military. What they do is up to you. The more we develop our armed forces, the more options we'll have."
 railskulker.2.a:0 "Have them hand out experimental weaponry."
 railskulker.2.b:0 "Have them tinker with our siege artillery."
 railskulker.2.c:0 "Have them maintain our siege artillery."
 railskulker.2.e:0 "They should supervise our weapon production."
 railskulker.2.f:0 "Set them to improving the armories."
 railskulker.2.g:0 "Have them make us some extra siege guns."
 railskulker.3.a:0 "Er Natvir is the capital of goblinkind!"
 railskulker.3.b:0 "Let us preserve Amldihr"
 railskulker.4.t:0 "The Breadth of the Dwarovar"
 railskulker.4.d:0 "Now that the age of orcish supremacy in the Dwarovar has truly come to end, it has become possible to scout far off sections and update our maps. This will no doubt be useful."
 railskulker.4.a:0 "We now know the full extent we must conquer."
 railskulker.5.t:0 "The Future of Our Military"
 railskulker.5.d:0 "As we expand our influence in the Dwarovar, we have begun recruiting from goblins that exist outside the wall of Er-Natvir, impressing them into our forces as fodder. While this has worked for the smaller disorganized groups of goblins that have so far been the main path of our expansion, the subjugation of two organized clans have given us an opportunity to improve our system. Two generals have put forward proposals.\n\nThe first is Yeet Jozmini, a grizzled veteran who has lead sappers and artillerists in our past battles. His plan calls for the integration of these clans fully into our military and a greater focus on gunpowder and engineering as part of our army.\n\nThe second general is Yeet Kozwitz, a young up and comer who believes that subugated clans should be organized into battleclans, which will be obligated to train and provide a levy for our wars of expansion. He argues that this levy will provide more and higher quality troops than we could via centralized training.\n\nWhichever general we choose will shape the future of our military."
 railskulker.5.a:0 "Go with Jozmini and create a technocratic army."
 railskulker.5.b:0 "Go with Kozwitz and create and formalize a system of levies."
 railskulker.6.t:0 "A Delegation from the $FROM$ Battleclan has Arrived"
 railskulker.6.d:0 "A a group of military officials from the $FROM$ Battleclan have arrived in $CAPITAL_CITY$ to discuss their levy obligations for the upcoming decade. Under the system established by Jozmini, we can put the best of their warriors under our direct command. Alternately, if $FROM$ is too weak or we simply wish otherwise, we can send military advisors to help the forces under their command."
 railskulker.6.a:0 "Integrate their best warriors under our command. Let the enemy face our united might!"
 railskulker.6.b:0 "Send some advisors to help $FROM$. They are looking rather weak."
 
 railskulker.7.t:0 "The $ROOT$ Military Engineer Corps"
 railskulker.7.d:0 "We have established a formal military engineer corps and now train promising recruits for this role rather than relying on preexisting expertise. We should choose a focus for military engineers serving in our army."
 railskulker.7.a:0 "Have them work with our sappers"
 railskulker.7.b:0 "Have them work with our artillery crews."
 
 railskulker.8.t:0 "Reforming the Artillery Yards"
 railskulker.8.d:0 "We have embarked on a series of reforms aimed at improving our production of artillery.What should we focus our efforts on? Quantity or Quality?."
 railskulker.8.a:0 "Set up the yards for mass production."
 railskulker.8.b:0 "Ensure every gun is made to the highest quality."

 railskulker.9.t:0 "Technocrats Debate the Role of Engineering In our Military"
 railskulker.9.d:0 "Technological advancement and a large body of military engineers has made our army into something fearsome. $ROOT$ has become synonymous with the thudering sound of gunfire and the boom of detonations. Yet there remains a debate on the exact way that technology and our engineers should enhance the army. One camp believes that our engineers should be focused on advancing our technology at a rapid pace, while the other belives that our engineers are most useful directly serving in the military. The outcome of this debate could have an impact on developing factions within our society."
 railskulker.9.a:0 "A focus on practical applications of our knowledge would serve us better."
 railskulker.9.b:0 "Technological advancement should come before all else."

 g_the_new_menace_title:0 "The New Menace"
 g_the_new_menace_desc:0 "Since the end of the Greentide, roving bands of dwarves have returned to their ancestral homeland with the hope of rekindling their ancient glory.

 g_never_again_title:0 "Never Again"
 g_never_again_desc:0 "When Dookanson’s horde first forced us into submission, we were a disorganized rabble and they were a mighty army. Now they fight amongst themselves for the scraps of his conquest and their forces are divided. We could never have withstood the full might of the horde, but our army is more than a match for these scattered remnants. We should destroy them one by one, and leave behind nothing but their bones."

 g_the_breakers_broken_and_the_crown_shattered_desc:0 "The breakers must be broken, the crown must be shattered.\n\nSiegebreaker has been eradicated, Shattered Crown has fallen beneath our blades, and now Amldihr is ours! The beating heart of the old Dwarven Empire is open to us, and even now our armies search the ruined halls in search of forgotten relics. With the resources of this Hold, the dwarves ruled over a mighty empire, and it is only fitting that we should do the same. All that remains is to purge the last traces of the orcs, and expel any survivors."
 g_the_warriors_with_words_title:0 "Warriors with Words"
 g_the_warriors_with_words_desc:0 "We’re the best around, and we’re not afraid to let everyone know it!

 g_no_more_black_orcs_desc:0 "The Black Orcs used to skulk through the Dwarovar, pillaging indiscriminately and tormenting our ancestors. Eradicating them was a major step on our road to vengeance, but there are Orcs outside our tunnels who we still haven’t taught to properly fear us. That’ll have to be corrected"
 g_get_the_escanni_ones_too_title:0 "The Escanni Ones Too!"
 g_get_the_escanni_ones_too_desc:0 "Escann is still infested with the last remnants of the Greentide. While these “civilized” orcs feud with each other and their human neighbours, let's give ‘em a taste of their own medicine.

 g_dont_let_the_ones_in_rahen_live_desc:0 "An orc is an orc, even when it's shackled by Hobgoblins. We’ve got no quarrel with The Command, but we’ve got unfinished business with their slaves, so they’ll have to find someone else to boss around. ‘All orcs must die’ means all orcs, even the ones with dangerous benefactors."
 g_the_job_is_done_title:0 "The Job is Done"
 g_the_job_is_done_desc:0 "Height, strength, and ferocity made no difference against our ingenuity and cunning. The orcs fell before us, as we always knew they would. For the first time in history, civilization can prosper without fear of orcish genocide. Spread the news far and wide lads, and tell everyone to rejoice - the world has been cleansed of every last orc!\n\nNow that our work is done, we might finally have enough free time to punish the others who've wronged us over the years. After all, a goblin's work is never done."
