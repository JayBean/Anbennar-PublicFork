 magic_project_lichdom.21.d:0 "\"We've had one form of unlife, yes. But what about a second unlife?\"\n\nSuch must have been the thought running through [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s head when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] decided to devote [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] to the pursuit of lichdom. In that quest [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has delved into dusty old tomes, pursued illicit magics, enacted unholy rituals. But it seems it all is to no avail.\n\nPerhaps a soul already severed from mortality does not take to a phylactery's binding. Perhaps a body that does not eat or drink cannot properly process the necessary elixirs. Perhaps it is just another magic lost to the Day of Ashen Skies. But whatever the reason, it seems this door closed on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a very long time ago."
