A courtier tries to open the door, only to find it locked. The mist takes the form of a young woman, now pale and dark haired. She grins her fangs.\n\nBloodshed.

Indeed, we have learned of what happened here from what few survivors remain. They have been hardened by many weeks spent fighting off frenzied vampires who continuously patrol in the night to find new prey to devour.\n\nHowever, the vampires, realizing they have run out of easy prey, have amassed into packs with simple, almost animalistic hierarchies. Slowly but surely, a gigantic swarm of vampires has gathered and is ready to leave the province to continue their blood frenzy elsewhere. Truly the conditions here in [Root.GetName] are much worse than we had been led to believe, and there are reports of similar situations in nearby lands. The adventurer guilds stand ready to lend their aid in establishing order here, and wait only for the command."

Mounting dread could threaten to throw vulnerable towns into anarchy. However, under the guidance of an effective adventurer captain, villages in [province.GetName] have organized militias dedicated to protecting themselves from both vampires and anyone seeking to capitalize on the chaos.\n\n While villages organizing into militias without the involvement of the government is a tad worrisome for our authority and control of the province, it may just be neccesary if we are to maintain order in the countryside during these uncertain times."

Several companies of adventurers have been tirelessly fighting the vampire menace, but are finding themselves low on supplies, weapons, and morale, and are unable to secure the funds required to keep operating. One such company has petitioned the king for aid in this matter. Their work in hunting down these feral vampires is invaluable, and surely our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would lend his support?"

The news is already spreading throughout our realm, telling of the brave men and women who fought back the attack and forced their retreat, saving the entire village. These men and women were a small band of adventurers who were near the town as the attack started. Had they not been there, there is no doubt of the carnage that would have occured."

 disaster_vampire_masquerade.103.t:0 "Vampire Hunting Methods"
 disaster_vampire_masquerade.103.d:0 "A question has been raised amongst our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and their advisors about the issue of vampire hunting. In the past, knowledge about the weaknesses of vampires and how to exploit them has been pretty limited; only elite, specialized monster hunters have generally held the knowledge. In the interest of keeping their niche profession, the most effective methods have remained in their hands as trade secrets. However, in a time as dire and chaotic as this, it may be prudent, or even neccesary to facilitate the spread of this information to the broader public; if regular civilians are more prepared and knowledgable about how to defeat vampires, our problems may be over much faster than originally anticipated. However, it would obviously upset the elite monster hunters of our realm, a group we may not want to be marginalizing at a time like this, when the realm needs them the most."

While the government was content to allow this in the past, the current situation proves that it would be better for us all if they were killed.\n\nThe professional vampire hunters in our realm have proven more than fit for the task. One force of vampire hunters, in conjunction with some of our own officials, launched investigations upon several prominent members of our nobility. Some were found inside their coffins and killed on the spot. Others were staked and left for the sun to kill them. Others, having seen the writing on the wall, had abandoned their manors entirely and fled elsewhere. Many more were found to be innocent. Whatever the outcome of these raids, we are a few steps closer to peace in our realm."

They hold land, titles, and positions all throughout our realm, and have influence over all stages of governance. While the government was content to allow this in the past, the current situation proves that it would be better for us all if they were killed.\n\nWhen a local noble was revealed as a vampire, an angry mob of peasants formed and marched on the vampire's manor, where they managed to force him to flee his estate. After looting the place, the mob continued on, and stormed the homes of two other minor nobles in the area, looting those as well. In the aftermath, it was found that neither of the nobles they killed were vampires, and that they were unjustly murdered. While they did kill a vampire, this sort of incident is difficult to justify, and the nobility threatens consequences for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] if they fail to put the peasants in their place."
 disaster_vampire_masquerade.106.a:0 "We must crack down."

As the Inquisition marches ever onwards, the few remaining vampires hiding amongst our nobility who still wish to follow the tenets of the masquerade have come to a wise conclusion.\n\nThey will not be able to hide forever. The Inquisition will find them and destroy them.\n\nAnd so they have gathered what belongings they could, and swiftly fled the country, seeking to worm their way into some other realm, forsaken by Nerat. At the very least, our nobility is pure once more. Something will need to be done about all of the empty castles, and the immense task of figuring out who inherits all these titles now lies in front of us.\n\nBut we will persevere. And we will emerge from this stronger and more united than ever before."
