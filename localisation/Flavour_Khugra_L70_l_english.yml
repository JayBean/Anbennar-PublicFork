    flavour_khugra.1.t:0 "War of Colours" 
    flavour_khugra.1.d:0 "The city of Khugra never knew independence, despite its strategically important location and long history. A major port within the Karasskas Empire, Khugra was one of the few cities that stayed loyal to Karassk during its collapse in the 8th century. In its rump state, plagued by turmoil and misfortune, Karassk eventually lost its ability to protect Khugra from external threats. When the Shagadyrra tribe besieged Khugra in 1389, Karassk did not answer the city's calls for help, leaving its people to their fate, and marking the start of Khugra’s history as an independent Ikatara.\n\nKhugra managed to negotiate peace with the tribe, accepting them as equals and employing them in the army. A few years later however, the ambitious Raktaya Teran of Nazhni blockaded the city, defeating their young fleet at sea. Khugra had to accept a humiliating peace agreement, selling entire districts of the city to Nazhnas traders.\n\nThe Shagadyrra tribes quickly integrated into Khugra's society. However, after Sykar Riverclaw defeated the Anzara empire and seized the city of Zerat, many tribesmen had shifted their loyalties, wishing to secede to Rayaz and enter the service of the chosen of the naga. Others prefer his brother Katyradz Riverclaw, who had recently taken the city of Ashuzal and is now in a bid to defeat the dying Karassk. If he succeeds in his mission, many in Khugra would be willing to overthrow the state to join his cause.\n\nKhugra's problems are numerous, and for many in the nation, pledging loyalty to one of these powerful states may be the only way to keep the city and its people safe. Should we side with Rayaz, Asarta, or Nahzni? Or should we shun them all and stay independent against all the odds? Only time will tell if we will manage to keep control over the nation, or if Khugra’s independence will be as fleeting as a footprint on the shore, washed away by relentless tides."
    flavour_khugra.1.a:0 "The future of Khugra lays in one of these colours"
    war_of_colours_tt:0 "You have three privileges giving powerful negative modifiers, representing foreign influence in your country. To remove them, you can submit to one of your three powerful neighbours, but you will still keep the privilege associated with them and you will lose the provinces in your country claimed by the other two powers. Alternatively, you can try to overcome the challenges by fully destroying the enemies of Khugra."
    war_of_colours_other_tt:0 "We will receive a starting truce with Khugra, as the failing state waits for the outcome of the war between Asarta and Karassk. After that, the city state might submit to one of their powerful neighbours in exchange for support. If a power that is not us is chosen, we will seize any province in Khugra that we have a claim on."

One of the political factions inside their nation advocates for submission to us, and if they come out victorious from the power struggle Khugra’s allegiance to our state will be ensured. Even if another manages to snatch the sapphire city first, some of the bordering regions of Khugra belong to us by right, and we should be able to seize them as a compensation prize."

    flavour_khugra.3.t:0 "Red Party Switches Allegiance"
    flavour_khugra.3.d:0 "Katyradz has failed, and the great city of Karassk remains firmly under the grip of the old kingdom. Our officials hoped that this would mean the disintegration of the Red Party, however they have been disappointed, as the traitors have been quick to switch their allegiance away from the would-be-conquerors and towards the successful defenders. They now advocate for our subjugation to our old overlord, who has largely usurped the role of Asarta in this War of Colours, changing a threat to our independence for another."

    flavour_khugra.4.d:0 "It seems like the party that advocated for submission to our nation has come out victorious from the internal power struggle in Khugra. Already they have sent diplomats requesting our protection in exchange for submission, an offer we are more than eager to accept. Some of their bordering regions have fallen under the control of the other powers involved in the struggle, but that is irrelevant now. Control over this rich port will be a great boon for our nation, and we took it without having to fire a single shot!"

    flavour_khugra.5.d:0 "Unfortunately it seems like the party that advocated for submission to our nation has been defeated during the power struggle in Khugra, and instead they have sworn allegiance to another of their neighbours. Many in our court are disappointed, but there is nothing we can do for now. If we want to seize Khugra in the future it will have to be through force of arms. However we have not come out of the War of Colours completely without reward, as our army has been able to seize the bordering lands we held claim over. We can only hope the people of Khugra soon come to regret the mistake they made."

Among their ranks there are wealthy traders that could lend us their ships, and admirals that could be of service to our nation, but perhaps it would be better to confiscate their properties for their betrayal, and use those funds to rebuild the nation."

There is no cost too great to restore our bond with these blessed beings, and as such we cut no expenses to ensure the magnificence of this celebration. The Araizary are clearly grateful for this display of devotion. Their silhouettes are spotted through the calm waves, spinning and dancing between the winds and the waters.

Thankfully we have come to save them from extinction! We will offer them evacuation towards Taneyas if they want it, they can serve our proud nation there! For the ones that stay, big promises are made, we will protect them from the vile jungle, even if we have to burn it to the ground. Their desperate situation makes accepting subjugation to Khugra the only option, and with the cooperation of the natives, making our new colony profitable will be much easier!"

They spew some nonsense about their ancestors crushing a lizardfolk empire under their boot, clearly an absurd myth whose antagonists only bear a coincidental resemblance to our kin.\n\nIf they keep this attitude, they will be denying themselves the immense riches and prosperity that would come from our virtuous rule. We cannot stand for this. Their violent and primitive religion will be crushed, and they will be enlightened to the great benefits of serving Khugra, whether they want it or not."

But our people stood proud, under the banner of the Sapphire Party. We rooted the traitors, crushed our enemies external and internal, and entered a new age, an age of prosperity, harmony, independence and glory. In the streets of the beautiful Sapphire City goods from all corners of Halann are sold for our citizens, lizardfolk, halfling, human and elf alike, to enjoy. The blessing of the Araizary is felt in the seas and shores across our empire, protecting the ships that rule the seas, our seas, today. This might seem like a happy ending for our story, but in reality, it is just the beginning, the start of a song which will continue for all eternity, the song of Khugra, Blessed Khugra, Khugra United, Khugra Eternal, Khugra Prosperous, Khugra Free."

Eventually they came across a great mansion owned by a young and attractive lizardfolk woman, who invited them to dinner. The Araizary warned our men to not take her offer, but a good part of our expedition disobeyed them. This was a fatal mistake, as the woman was a vile witch who casted a spell on their food, turning them into tchokens! The rest of our sailors managed to escape, taking with them some of the found treasures. However, this is of little comfort for the mourning families of the tchokenified sailors."

In a bizarre turn of events, the Araizary have led our great journey to…another great journey. It seems like these lizardfolk embarked on a journey on their own years ago, and were just never driven back to their port by the Araizary, so they were kept lost in the seas, fed and supplied by the Araizary but unable to make it back to their homeland. We soon found out that this was not a malicious act by the Araizary, as after a brief talk with them we have come to realise the city they wished to return to was razed by hostile conquerors years ago. Their old home might be no more, however they do have a place to return, a new home in the proud nation of Khugra!"

Upon questioning our Araizary friends about their fate, they have informed us they are all safe and sound, but, “it is not their fate to return to Khugra”. No elaboration was offered besides this puzzling estatement, but at least we know they are not dead. Regardless, some of our people have accused our government of incompetence, claiming that the reason the Araizary do not want to return our men is that they believe they are better off in the seas than under a bad government."
