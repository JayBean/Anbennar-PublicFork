    flavour_khugra.1.d:0 "The city of Khugra, despite its strategically important location and long history, never knew independence. A major port within Karasskas Empire, Khugra was one of the few cities that stayed loyal to Karrask during the empire's collaspe in the 8th century. As turmoil and misfortune continued to plague Ikatara of Karassk, they eventually lost the ability to protect Khugra from threats. When the Shagadyrra tribe besieged Khugra in 1389, Karassk did not answer their call for help, leaving the city to its own devices. That was the start of Khugra as an independent Ikatara.\n\nKhugra managed to negotiate peace with Shagadyrra tribe, accepting them as equals and emplying them as Khugra's army. But a few years later, the ambitious Raktaya Teran of Nazhni blockaded the city, defeating their young fleet at sea. Khugra had to accept humiliating peace offer, which sold entire districts of the Khugra city to Nazhnas traders.\n\nShagadyrra tribes quickly integrated in Khugra's society, but now with Sykar Riverclaw defeating the Anzara empire and seizing the city of Zerat, that peace has been shattered. Many tribesmen shifted their loyalties to the king selected by Nagas and wished to cede to Rayaz. Others prefer his brother Katyradz Riverclaw, who is much closer and almost as powerful as his brother Sykar. Katyradz has recently taken the city of Ashuzal, and if he is not defeated by a dying Karassk, our nobles will likely overthrow us to join his cause.\n\nKhugra's problems are many, and pledging our loyalty to one of our larger neighbours may be the only way to keep us safe."
