    flavour_khugra.1.t:0 "War of Colours" 
    flavour_khugra.1.d:0 "The city of Khugra never knew independence, despite its strategically important location and long history. A major port within the Karasskas Empire, Khugra was one of the few cities that stayed loyal to Karassk during its collapse in the 8th century. In its rump state, plagued by turmoil and misfortune, Karassk eventually lost its ability to protect Khugra from external threats. When the Shagadyrra tribe besieged Khugra in 1389, Karassk did not answer the city's calls for help, leaving its people to their fate, and marking the start of Khugra’s history as an independent Ikatara.\n\nKhugra managed to negotiate peace with the tribe, accepting them as equals and employing them in the army. A few years later however, the ambitious Raktaya Teran of Nazhni blockaded the city, defeating their young fleet at sea. Khugra had to accept a humiliating peace agreement, selling entire districts of the city to Nazhnas traders.\n\nThe Shagadyrra tribes quickly integrated into Khugra's society. However, after Sykar Riverclaw defeated the Anzara empire and seized the city of Zerat, many tribesmen had shifted their loyalties, wishing to secede to Rayaz and enter the service of the chosen of the naga. Others prefer his brother Katyradz Riverclaw, who had recently taken the city of Ashuzal and is now in a bid to defeat the dying Karassk. If he succeeds in his mission, many in Khugra would be willing to overthrow the state to join his cause.\n\nKhugra's problems are numerous, and for many in the nation, pledging loyalty to one of these powerful states may be the only way to keep the city and its people safe. Should we side with Rayaz, Asarta, or Nahzni? Or should we shun them all and stay independant against all the odds? Only time will tell if we will manage to keep control over the nation, or if Khugra’s independence will be as fleeting as a footprint on the shore, washed away by relentless tides."

If he succeeds in his mission, many in Khugra would be willing to overthrow the state to join his cause.\n\nIt is obvious that Khugra cannot survive on its own, and that one of the neighbouring powers will soon seize control of the young nation. One of the political factions inside their nation advocates for submission to us, and if they come out victorious from the power struggle Khugra’s allegiance to our state will be ensured. Even if another manages to snatch the sapphire city first, some of the bordering regions of Khugra belong to us by right, and we should be able to seize them as a compensation prize."

    flavour_khugra.3.t:0 "Support for Katyradz vanishes"
    flavour_khugra.3.d:0 "With Katyradz failing to seize the city of Karassk, support for the Red Party starts to vanish, quickly eliminating this threat to Khugra's stability."
    flavour_khugra.3.a:0 "One less to worry about"
    
    flavour_khugra.4.t:0 "Khugra submits to us"
    flavour_khugra.4.d:0 "It seems like the party that advocated for submission to our nation has come out victorious from the internal power struggle in Khugra. Already they have sent diplomats requesting our protection in exchange for submission, an offer we are more than eager to accept. Some of their bordering regions have fallen under the control of the other powers involved in the struggle, but that is irrelevant now. Having established control over this rich port will be a great boon for our nation, and we did it without having to fire a single shot!"
    flavour_khugra.4.a:0 "About time they came into the fold"
    
    flavour_khugra.5.t:0 "Khugra submits to others"
    flavour_khugra.5.d:0 "Unfortunately it seems like the party that advocated for submission to our nation has been defeated during the power struggle in Khugra, and instead they have sworn allegiance to another of their neighbours. Many in our court are disappointed, but there is nothing we can do for now. If we want to seize Khugra in the future it will have to be through force of arms. However we have not come out of the War of Colours completely without reward, as our army has been able to seize the bordering lands we held claim over. We can only hope the people of Khugra soon come to sorely regret the mistake they made."
    flavour_khugra.5.a:0 "At least we got something from that deal"

    war_of_colours_tt:0 "You have three privileges giving powerful negative modifiers, representing foreign influence in your country. To remove them, you can submit to one of your three powerful neighbors, but you will still keep the privilege associated with them and you will lose the provinces in your country claimed by the other two powers. Alternatively, you can try to overcome the challenges by fully destroying the enemies of Khugra."
    war_of_colours_other_tt:0 "We will receive a starting truce with Khugra, as the failing state waits for the outcome of the war between Asarta and Karrask. After that, the city state might submit to one of their powerful neighbors in exchange for support. If a power that is not us is chosen, we will seize any province in Khugra that we have a claim on."
