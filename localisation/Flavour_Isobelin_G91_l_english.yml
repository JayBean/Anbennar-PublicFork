 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_river_title:0 "The Lady’s River"
 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_river_desc:0 "The explorers, traders, and unruly adventurers departing from the docks of Port Isobel to find their fortunes inland have taken to calling the river up which they sail the Lady Isobel. They report lands that may be put to good use supporting a growing city. By sponsoring our own expeditions to chart, claim, and settle the lands adjoining the Lady’s River, we can make this true in more than name only."
 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_landing_title:0 "The Lady’s Landing"
 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_landing_desc:0 "We have had the fortune of landing on a stretch of Aelantir’s coast positively brimming with opportunities: an archipelago of islands with deep natural harbors, fields ripe for planting on the mainland, and a wide river that beckons us to the interior. We must seize this opportunity before other arrivals from the Old World snatch it up."
 isobelin_mission_the_dream_of_a_city_title:0 "The Dream of a City"
 isobelin_mission_the_dream_of_a_city_desc:0 "“A fortnight past our entrance to the Ruined Sea, we beheld the Island, cresting over the tides, as a dream of dawn crests over a night of terrors.”\n- From the Journal of Lady Isobel\n\nFrom the Lilac Wars, Greentide, and Age of Cinders, to the new conflicts bubbling below the surface, the cities of Cannor and Bulwar have known nothing but fire and death at the hands of monsters and petty men, often one and the same. Here, in this new land, we have a chance to plant the seed of a new city away from the wreckage of our homelands, a rose whose bloom shall be the envy of the whole world, a dream made manifest."
 isobelin_mission_fort_and_walkway_title:0 "Fort and Walkway"
 isobelin_mission_fort_and_walkway_desc:0 "Commerce must flow from the lands beyond the Cliffs of Ruin for our city to blossom. Already plans have been drawn up for a grand walkway, bedecked with all manner of plantlife, traversing the natural passage where the Lady Isobel meets the cliffs. And just as the most beautiful rose needs thorns to protect it, we have broken for a stronghold to secure the walkway from threats from above and below."
 isobelin_mission_a_rose_garden_in_the_swampland_title:0 "A Garden in a Swamp"
 isobelin_mission_a_rose_garden_in_the_swampland_desc:0 "We find ourselves far away from the verdant vineyards of Lencenor, amongst strange landscapes. The Trollsmaw Swamp, teeming with life, may offer fertile ground to transplant Cannorian flora. Indeed, some recently arrived transmuters on Mage Street have claimed that a clever use of the plant growth spell may create not just a lush rose garden, but even enhance the defenses of the Fort itself, ensconcing the walls and towers with giant vines that can whip their thorns at would be attackers."
 isobelin_mission_control_the_troll_toll_title:0 "Control the Troll Toll"
 isobelin_mission_control_the_troll_toll_desc:0 "The islands of [1051.GetName] lie at the entrance of the Trollsbay, and are perfectly situated to collect a toll from ships passing into and out of the bay. Of course, any clever captain will seek to circumvent such a toll. To safeguard our commercial interests, and to ensure toll collection - and therefore the  rule of law, we should establish a base on these islands and a fleet of ships capable of enforcing the Troll Toll."
 isobelin_mission_up_the_ynn_title:0 "Up the Ynn"
 isobelin_mission_up_the_ynn_desc:0 "By the reports of intrepid explorers stopping in Port Isobel, the Ynn is truly massive, its watershed stretching across the entire continent, making our Lady’s River seem like a pleasant brook in comparison. They report an frightful, eerie feeling from the swamp at the river’s mouth, as if the water were speaking to them, but most brave it to reach the riches beyond the Cliffs. We must control this passage into the interior if we are to dominate the commerce of the Trollsbay."
 isobelin_mission_isobels_will_title:0 "The Widow’s Will"
 isobelin_mission_isobels_will_desc:0 "Upon her passing, the Esteemed Widow has left us not just the remainder of her considerable fortune, but parting words of wisdom: true freedom for all is to be found when all submit to the rule of law. Although this ideal is hard to imagine in the chaotic wake of a century of catastrophes,it is one which shall be a guiding light as we build our city."
 isobelin_mission_found_mawgate_prison_title:0 "Found Mawgate Prison"
 isobelin_mission_found_mawgate_prison_desc:0 "Theft, brawls, public drunkenness, and worse: Isobelin faces the same crimes and disorder as any other fast growing colony brimming with opportunity. However, if we hew to our founding ideals, we must not settle for mere frontier justice. We should establish courts of law, and a prison where those who have been found guilty can serve their sentences. A rocky island in the middle of the River at the entrance of the Trollsmaw Swamp may be a prime location."
 isobelin_mission_cultivate_cult_contacts_title:0 "Cultivate Cult Contacts"
 isobelin_mission_cultivate_cult_contacts_desc:0 "The Cheshoshi certainly made an impression when they first appeared at the periphery of our settlements, their skin tattooed pitch black, terrifying and infuriating our friends among the Jayek. It soon became clear that although they worshiped death, plenty of them still wanted to make a living - as mercenaries, they could hold their own against both Cannorians and ruinborn alike, and for a reasonable price. Deepening this commercial relationship and expanding into their southern markets could prove to be immensely profitable, if distasteful to some of our citizens."
 isobelin_mission_tower_street_title:0 "Tower Street"
 isobelin_mission_tower_street_desc:0 "Among the first permanent buildings we constructed on Isobel Island was a lighthouse to guide ships into port. Soon, market stalls sprung up around it, and one of the main thoroughfares of the Island snaked its way away from it. Tower Street has quickly become synonymous with the bustling commercial life of our growing city. Everything can be bought, sold, bartered (and occasionally stolen) here, from swords and shields, to Roilsardi wine, to Escanni orcs bound in shackles. We should cement our place as Trollsbay’s premier center of commerce by expanding and bringing order to Tower Street."
 isobelin_mission_jayek_bridge_title:0 "The Twin Bridges"
 isobelin_mission_jayek_bridge_desc:0 "We have begun to build roads over the hunting trails lacing through Isobel Island cut by the Jayek long ago, but transportation between the archipelago and the mainland is limited to ferries and other small watercraft, hindering our development and leaving our citizens and their goods vulnerable to pirates. Fortuitously, a new dwarf arrival from Menibór has drawn up an ambitious proposal modeled on his people’s masterful bridge building over the Luna: twin bridges of rock and iron, connecting Jayekmoot to Isobel Island, and Isobel Island to the mainland."
 isobelin_mission_city_hall_title:0 "Isobelin City Hall"
 isobelin_mission_city_hall_desc:0 "As our city has developed, political fractures have started to emerge, and old tensions find life in the new world. The Roilsardi who originally accompanied the Widow across the sea wish to preserve their privileged positions, while new arrivals from Anbennar, Lencenor, and Bulwar are fighting to ensure they have a place in the city. Some amount of conflict is necessary for a state’s continued vitality, but not so much that it threatens to boil over into the streets. We should establish both physical and political structures to ensure that this enriches Isobelin with reasoned debate, rather than compromise it through mindless bloodshed."
 isobelin_mission_the_navy_yard_title:0 "The Navy Yard"
 isobelin_mission_the_navy_yard_desc:0 "From great galleons filled with dreamers from Cannor seeking new shores, to simple dinghies with their simple fishermen seeking today’s catch, ships are the lifeblood of our city. A great number are in need of repair and refitting after making the perilous journey across the ocean. Having a dedicated shipyard would make Isobelin the maritime hub for the whole Trollsbay, and would also give us the facilities to construct our own fleets for war and commerce."
 isobelin_mission_an_awakening_city_title:0 "An Awakening City"
 isobelin_mission_an_awakening_city_desc:0 "Insults, followed by shouts, followed by hands reaching for daggers, as an orc street sweeper and a well-dressed Roilsardi aristocrat bump shoulders on Tower Street - halted by the arrival of a stern patrolman of the Republican Guard. Coins clinking on a table in a nearby in a cramped counting house, as a local merchant concludes an exchange with her counterpart from Vertesk - twenty bales of cotton and a precious artifact from the Precursor Elves, for twelve kegs of Varainéy gunpowder, and nine shackled Venomtooth orcs. Down the road, nails hammering into beams as a gregarious Brasani carpenter and his taciturn Jayek apprentice raise a new addition to an already haphazard tenement.\n\nThe sounds of a city stirring, as Isobelin awakes."
 isobelin_mission_rehabilitate_the_ruinborn_title:0 "Rehabilitate the Ruinborn"
 isobelin_mission_rehabilitate_the_ruinborn_desc:0 "“Written on their very faces was ruin, and while their visages brought bats and beasts to mind, their hearts were love-filled just as ours. Pity, these creatures need, not revulsion.”\n-The Journal of Lady Isobel\n\nOur Lady landed on these shores with a dream of a home for all, united under the law, with the promise of flourishing through hard work and self-betterment. This promise should be available not just to new arrivals like us, but to those who lived on these shores when we landed. The Jayek have shown their worth ten times over. We should help them elevate themselves to their highest potential."
 isobelin_mission_the_twin_batteries_title:0 "The Twin Batteries"
 isobelin_mission_the_twin_batteries_desc:0 "Almost as soon as we planted our flag on Isobel Island, we moved quickly to establish an outpost across the Strait. While this stretch of mainland does not offer the same deep water harbors as the Island, it serves as a vital ferry terminal for goods and people traveling to the interior. It is necessary for the growth of the city that we secure the mouth of the Lady’s River against raids by sea and by land by constructing twin batteries facing east and west."
 isobelin_mission_little_isobelin_title:0 "Little Isobelin"
 isobelin_mission_little_isobelin_desc:0 "With the right to vote and hold property granted by the Isobelin City Council to the Jayek, and with the right to settle, hunt, fish and farm on Jayek lands granted to Cannorians by their chieftains, we have become like brothers with the natives. Some have even taken to calling their main encampment on Isobel Island “Little Isobelin”. We should recognize this unity by bringing them under our banner and within our borders, so none will ever think to prey on them again."
 isobelin_mission_brothers_reunited_title:0 "Brothers Reunited"
 isobelin_mission_brothers_reunited_desc:0 "No one would have anticipated the extent to which the fortunes of the native Jayek has become tied to our own. They welcomed us with open arms, coming to our aid during the first harsh winter on these shores, and in turn, our guns ward off death cultists and less scrupulous Cannorians from raiding their villages.\n\nThey tell us they were sundered from their people, ostracized when the Boek confederated, all but banished to these islands. That such wrong could be done to so kind a people by those who proclaim themselves “brothers” is an injustice - and the Lady wills that justice be done."
 isobelin_mission_stronger_together_title:0 "Stronger Together"
 isobelin_mission_stronger_together_desc:0 "Our fellow settlers on the Trollsbay differ from us in as many ways as we are similar. Our open embrace of all newcomers stands in contrast to our standoffish neighbors in Thilvis and Zanlib, and the almost leechlike gentry of Marlliande could not be more different from the freedom fighters of Valorpoint. However, we do share common threats, from the ascendant and belligerent Star Elves, to the hulking great power of Lorent. We should set aside our differences for time being to further the goal of common defense."
 isobelin_mission_divert_trade_from_the_interior_title:0 "Upriver Isobelin"
 isobelin_mission_divert_trade_from_the_interior_desc:0 "Compared to the unnerving and dismal fens and bogs around Ynnsmouth, the charming marshes and lush glades of the Trollsmaw offer a tranquil escape from Port Isobel for those who can afford a country manor on some of the newly cleared land. Indeed, so many transplants from the city have arrived that some refer to it as Upriver Isobelin. This development can be furthered by diverting trade that otherwise might flow down the Ynn to the Lady Isobel."
 isobelin_mission_isobelin_stock_exchange_title:0 "The Stock Exchange"
 isobelin_mission_isobelin_stock_exchange_desc:0 "No one can deny that our city is the financial capital of Aelantir. Letters of credit and foreign coinage and of every sort change hands in our market stalls and back offices at a dizzying pace, and stocks and loans are issued nearly as fast as they can be put to paper. Like a raging river, this commercial chaos should be channeled into a more manageable and productive form, from which all can profit: a singular stock exchange, magnificent to behold, in a place of honor at the head of Tower Street."
 isobelin_mission_the_port_authority_title:0 "The Port Authority"
 isobelin_mission_the_port_authority_desc:0 "With wooden masts of merchant ships nearly blotting out the city behind them, one could easily mistake the harbor for a forest. Isobelin is the port of call for countless ships plying the waters of the New World. However, more than a few unscrupulous captains lay anchor in our harbor. To combat smuggling and the skirting of harbor fees, we should empower the Harbormaster with a new authority, and the arms to enforce it."
 isobelin_mission_hostile_takeover_title:0 "Hostile Takeover"
 isobelin_mission_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "The Derrane and Calassani Trade Companies, as well as a self-governing and militarized branch of the Asra Bank, lay claim to numerous islands and trading posts across the Ruined Sea, draining the Trollsbay and North Aelantir of its wealth. To secure our rightful place of financial dominance, these middlemen for Cannorian commercial interests must be dispatched."
 isobelin_mission_crashing_the_concord_title:0 "Crashing the Concord"
 isobelin_mission_crashing_the_concord_desc:0 "Money makes the world go ‘round, and if there is a center of financial gravity around which the Trollsbay spins, it is the halls of Isobelin’s Stock Exchange. Our stockbrokers have broad and deep investments across the Trollsbay: Cestirmark timber companies, Marlliande plantations, Valorpoint wyvern-forges, Thílvisian dye manufacturers, Zanlibi printing presses. Some in the Stock Exchange and in City Hall have started asking themselves: if we have bought their economies wholesale, why should we not own all the rest? The temporary political chaos this would cause our neighbors would be in their best long-term interests."
 isobelin_mission_a_concord_united_title:0 "The Concord United"
 isobelin_mission_a_concord_united_desc:0 "When Cestirmark’s founder Varil sína Cymainé wrote to Lady Isobel suggesting they put aside their differences and work together for the greater good, she dismissed him as “a small man with small glasses that tries to compensate with the scope of his ideas". She was correct about the man, but his idea may be worthwhile to revisit. Bringing together the different peoples of Trollsbay under one government and one law may be the best way to ensure our mutual protection and prosperity. As the melting pot of Aelantir, it is natural that we should lead such a Concord."
 isobelin_mission_the_isobelin_tribune_title:0 "Start Spreading the News"
 isobelin_mission_the_isobelin_tribune_desc:0 "A city runs on gossip: where’s the best deal on a loaf of bread, which landlord offers the cheapest rent, which officers in the Republican Guard are easiest to strike a deal with so your “non-regulatory” goods can get to market. Our cosmopolitan city thrives with news from abroad, as immigrants are eager to hear the latest from home. A bustling print industry has spawned several contenders to serve these needs, from the stodgy mainstay Lady’s Tribune, to the salacious Trollsbay Crier, to the stockbroker’s favorite Tower Street Times. So long as they do not endorse lawlessness, we should promote these entrepreneurial journalistic efforts."
 isobelin_mission_from_the_rivers_to_the_bay_title:0 "Yoking the Ynn"
 isobelin_mission_from_the_rivers_to_the_bay_desc:0 "Even though we control the Ynn at its mouth, our growing city sees only a fraction of the commerce from the vast territories in the interior of the continent. By exerting our influence beyond the Cliffs of Ruin, we may ensure that more of the Ynn’s trade is diverted to the Lady Isobel, finding its way to and from the sea through Port Isobel, where we can collect our toll."
 isobelin_mission_black_on_black_in_little_bulwar_title:0 "Black on Black in Little Bulwar"
 isobelin_mission_black_on_black_in_little_bulwar_desc:0 "Our country and city is maritime at heart. The curt and coarse speech of sailors slips into everyday vernacular, their speedy and swaggering walk sets the pace for the city streets, and the handsome black coats and trousers of the navy have become the daywear of every self-respecting Isobeliner. The clothiers of Little Bulwar have apparently discovered a way to weave and dye black cloth on a grand scale, which may be cut to clothing of any fit in the Garment Quarter. Some even rumor they have even woven minor cantrips into the cloth to ensure good luck for the wearer. We should encourage this industry, both for profit and our undeniable sense of fashion."
 isobelin_mission_the_five_wards_title:0 "Five Wards, One City"
 isobelin_mission_the_five_wards_desc:0 "The Island, the Port, Jayekmoot, Smallmouth, Trasilden. Although each has had their own municipal history and identity, they have steadily grown together over the decades. These petty bureaucratic differences must be swept aside. The five are each fingers of one hand, to be opened to the world or closed into a fist."
 isobelin_mission_the_garment_quarter_title:0 "The Garment Quarter"
 isobelin_mission_the_garment_quarter_desc:0 "While the initial coterie of elvish clothiers was focused on the elaborate costumes for the Thornsway theaters, the more enterprising ones expanded the scope of their business to fine clothing for the merchant elite of our city. Their apprentices and children followed in their footsteps, but not all were able to break into the luxury market. Instead, they made fetching but affordable wear for clerks, civil servants, and others who work with their minds, and sturdy but handsome wear for laborers and those that work with their hands. This garment industry, clustered in Elven Quarter, has given that neighborhood a second name. With the proper encouragement from the city government, our style shall be the envy of the world."
 isobelin_mission_the_jaybean_roastery_title:0 "The Jaybean Roastery"
 isobelin_mission_the_jaybean_roastery_desc:0 "Our citizens bustle to and fro, never having enough minutes in the hour or hours in the day, shunning sleep in pursuit of their dreams. Serendipitously, our friends the Jayek have facilitated this. They have long cultivated the beans of the Dark Beverage, with a potent brewing style strong enough to keep even the most frenetic Isobeliner up all night. We should make every effort to ensure that no Isobeliner goes without their beloved Cup of Jay."
 isobelin_mission_an_arising_city_title:0 "An Arising City"
 isobelin_mission_an_arising_city_desc:0 "The tang of sweat, pitch, and salted fish as a crew of half-orc longshoremen break bulk on a two-master from Rivsby. The acrid aroma of an over-brewed cup of jay from a cheap street vendor, hastily gulped down by an apprentice broker hustling to the Stock Exchange. Paint fumes and choking sawdust billowing over a Thornsway stage, as its harried director curses the craftsmen’s imperfect execution of her dazzling vision.\n\nFor some, an enchanting fragrance, and others, an odious odor: the smells of an arising city, taking in the first breath of a new day."
 isobelin_mission_the_racks_title:0 "The Racks"
 isobelin_mission_the_racks_desc:0 "Isobelin’s halflings, like all the denizens in our city, are hustlers and strivers. Some, despite their short stature, have reached the height of wealth and prestige, and have set their sights beyond the cramped tenements of the Stacks where their forebears first set up. They have begun to move across the straights, settling into a suburban community near the aptly named Smallmouth, named for the many drying racks of their favorite tobaccos. Here, they can remain close to the city, but enjoy the country life of old, with full pipes and full bellies. We should ensure that The Racks remain tied to the city proper, and the taxable wealth does not get squirreled away in their hidey-holes."
 isobelin_mission_thornsway_title:0 "Thornsway"
 isobelin_mission_thornsway_desc:0 "Built atop an old Jayek hunting trail running from one end of Isobel Island to the other, Thornsway has become synonymous with the spirit of the growing city: loud, exaggerated, filled to the brim and overflowing with life. An avenue of bright lights and shady people, rich planters and merchants being entertained by thespians on the stage, and courtesans in the bordello - often, indeed, the same entertainer. All trades are welcome, so long as they pay their taxes and maintain their proper permits. Thornsway serves as the first stop for many new arrivals from Cannor on a tour of the New World. The open purses of these so-called “tourists” may serve as a rich source of potential revenues."
 isobelin_mission_the_stacks_title:0 "The Stacks"
 isobelin_mission_the_stacks_desc:0 "With their little hairy feet pattering down the gang planks of the quaint, charming boats that ferried them from Viswall and Beepeck, some newly arrived halflings have brought a novel architectural innovation along with barrels of tobacco and salted pork. With the prime lots on Isobel Island already claimed and under development, they have set to work on marginal land. Without the space to build out, they have started to build up, stacking one house on top of another. These “stacks”, as the neighborhood is now called, might be replicated in other parts of the city where land is becoming scarce - with bigger doors and taller ceilings, of course."
 isobelin_mission_bring_the_hyenas_to_heel_title:0 "Bring the Hyenas to Heel"
 isobelin_mission_bring_the_hyenas_to_heel_desc:0 "Long the terrors of the Divenhal, gnoll pirates were an infrequent but dreaded threat in our Esteemed Widow’s native Toarnaire. These demon-worshiping dogs have crossed the ocean in their so-called Scourge Fleet to ply their vile trade in the Ruined Sea. Some have even had the temerity to claim rights under the Charter to commerce and settlement in Isobelin. A small gnoll quarter has settled into the darker corners around the North Docks, and with them, a spike in smuggling and the sale and use of illicit, demonic intoxicants. The situation will soon be out of control, and voices in the city council are calling for a punitive expedition against the buccaneers. Other Aelantiri settlers, particularly those from Bulwar and the mercantile states, may help us put these curs in their place."
 isobelin_mission_dueling_veridicals_title:0 "Dueling Archprovosts"
 isobelin_mission_dueling_veridicals_desc:0 "As the largest city in the Trollsbay, Port Isobel should be the natural choice for the chief seat of Ravelianism in the region. However, the far less significant city of Vincenton across the bay also claims this place of honor, on the basis of their longer history as Ravelians. Obviously, this contradiction cannot stand. A fair compromise would be to grant a veridical seat for both Isobel Island and the mainland district, to recognize our preeminence. We should dispatch an emissary to the High Rectorate to make this request."
 isobelin_mission_the_question_of_slavery_title:0 "The Question of Slavery"
 isobelin_mission_the_question_of_slavery_desc:0 "Slavery has stood as a contradiction at the heart of Isobelin since the first orc stepped on the auction blocks. A city founded on the premise of everyone having rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of wealth, whose commercial heart beats with the blood of those bound in chains. A generation ago, their half-orc children could hope to rise only to the level of a gardener or a longshoreman, whereas now they may be the greengrocer or the harbormaster - yet their kin pass by their docks and storefronts shackled and doomed to lives of misery and servitude.\n\nA question has grown in volume, from whispers in the taverns of the Bridge District to the headlines of the Lady’s Tribune. What is right and what is wrong - the right to liberty, or the right to profit?"
 isobelin_mission_amalgamated_tinkerers_of_isobelin_title:0 "Amalgamated Tinkerers"
 isobelin_mission_amalgamated_tinkerers_of_isobelin_desc:0 "When the first carpenter, mason, or adventurer stepped off the boat in Port Isobel, guilds followed with them. And for just as long, the apprentices and journeymen have resented their overbearing guildmasters. This tension in the newly established Artificer’s Guild has grown harder to ignore. “Tinkering, Not Toiling” is the call of the agitators. Already they have begun to wield power, laying down their tools en masse and refusing to work without fair wages. It may be possible to prevent this conflict from turning violent by granting them some rights and protections, while not entirely upending the established order."
 isobelin_mission_roscolum_university_title:0 "Roscolum University"
 isobelin_mission_roscolum_university_desc:0 "Education in Isobelin has been a haphazard, frenetic melting pot. A dozen different languages can fill a given classroom, and lecturers from every corner of the world gather to vociferously debate. Scholars whose ideas and research do not fit into the norms of the Old World have joined together to give their research and teaching an institutional legitimacy, naming their school after the Rose and Dove of Lencenor and Anbennar. We should encourage this: the world’s greatest city deserves a university to match."
 isobelin_mission_a_wreath_of_roses_title:0 "Uprooting the City"
 isobelin_mission_a_wreath_of_roses_desc:0 "The Esteemed Widow dreamed of a city, and the one that has arisen since she passed is itself laid out with the twisting logic of a dream. Even native born Isobeliners can get lost going from one side of the Island to another. A group of architects and civil servants have recently proposed an ambitious plan for a complete renewal, tearing out old weeds and planting a vibrant new city in their place. Such an enterprise will take many years, to say nothing of the cost - but there’s nothing an Isobeliner loves more than a chance to prove themselves up to a challenge."
 isobelin_mission_the_city_that_never_sleeps_title:0 "The City That Never Sleeps"
 isobelin_mission_the_city_that_never_sleeps_desc:0 "Darkness under Tower Street, broken as the Isobel Island Local emerges into Erel Station, the golden light of the setting sun streaming through the high arched windows. Next stop: the red brick-paved Concord Square, where amalgamated gnome glassworkers and dwarf masons rally to demand better wages and shorter hours. The tracks rise above the blue slate rooftops of the Bridge District, where a gang of half-orc teenagers stop roughhousing to watch the sparkdrive locomotive hurtle overhead. At Thornsway Junction, a kaleidoscope of passengers scuttle between platforms: born-and-bred Isobeliners dressed head to toe in black, Stock Exchangers in Garment Quarter silks out for a night at the theater, halflings in earth-toned farmwear commuting back to the Racks after selling their produce in the City.\n\nAs the sun goes down, lamps and torches alight, joining the Thorned Lady’s eternal flame. One sees that life in the city doesn’t slow with nightfall. It speeds up - the speed of all its people on the chase. One sees an unsleeping city full of wide-awake dreamers."
 isobelin_mission_the_widows_park_title:0 "The Widow’s Park"
 isobelin_mission_the_widows_park_desc:0 "As Isobel Island became covered from end to end in buildings and roads, a sight of green became a luxury. A backyard garden, or a private park glimpsed through a fence, was the best a common Isobeliner could hope for. To address this the Commissioner’s Plan calls for a great octagonal park to be planted at the very heart of the city, for the enjoyment and recreation of all citizens."
 isobelin_mission_the_thorned_lady_title:0 "The Thorned Lady"
 isobelin_mission_the_thorned_lady_desc:0 "In the centuries since Lady Isobel sailed from Tornaire, we have grown distinct from that city and forged our own identity outside the petty divisions of Lencenori and Anbennarian. However, the citizens there hold us in high regard, as distant kinsmen who have left home and achieved great things.\n\nA group of artisans and mages from Tornaire have written to us with the desire to gift us a grand monument: the Esteemed Widow, two hundred feet tall, clad in bronze and crowned in silver thorns, carrying an eternal flame of a golden lamp to light the way to our shores - and to hurl fireballs at any who would try to take our liberty."

 flavor_isobelin.10.t:0 "Anguncóst Cartels"
 flavor_isobelin.10.d:0 "Goblins had lived in Isobelin in very small numbers since the first orcs from Escann were bought and sold, being thrown into auctions as amusing little oddities. Free goblins formed an insular community in the worst tenements of the Bridge District, friendless and fending for themselves. This changed with the arrival of cartel agents from Bayvic.\n\nRespected as cutthroat traders, sometimes quite literally, these City Goblins took to the rapidly urbanizing Port Isobel, many choosing to settle permanently as Aelantir-based representatives of Bayvic cartels. Their neighborhood, an unused stretch of waterfront in the Lower District, earned the tongue-in-cheek name Anguncóst - “ant coast” - for their small size and great numbers, and to poke fun at Isobelin’s competition for greatest city in the world. They soon went into business for themselves, giving the Soot Goblins of Mestikardu a run for their money as the richest of their kind west of the Lament.\n\nThe Anguncóst cartels distinguished themselves in two ways. First, their chief commercial activity was not in manufacturing or trading in physical goods. Instead, they were some of the most successful stock brokers on Tower Street, specializing in high-risk, high-reward ventures, amassing huge fortunes one day and losing them the next. Second, they exemplified the melting pot of Isobelin. Common Goblins from Escann and Exodus Goblins from Bulwar joined with their City Goblin kin in their relentless pursuit of profit."
 flavor_isobelin.10.a:0 "Mind your wallets, purses, and stock portfolios."
 flavor_isobelin.11.t:0 "The Wudikmen Clan Merits All Respect"
 flavor_isobelin.11.d:0 "Even the most seasoned Isobeliner was struck by the sight of one hundred seven foot tall tiger-men, followed by harpies and gold-scaled kobolds, disembarking from a Yansheni junk, resplendent in flowing orange robes and carrying quarterstaffs. Through an interpreter they explained that they had met members of the Trollsbay Museum expedition to Haless, hearing of our city and our open doors, and of the martial prowess of the Jayek Braves. These apparent monks wished to test themselves against these fearsome warriors in ritualized sparring.\n\nThe Jayek, true to their long-held hospitality, gave them land to construct a monastery on Jayekmoot, and younger Braves and daring non-ruinborn stepped forward to learn their ways, earning many black eyes and broken teeth. They came to be known as the Wudikmen Clan, a misnomer, as they were not a clan but a school, and came from many temples other than Wudikmen.\n\nThe children of these monks who did not wish to follow their parents' righteous path established Little Yanshen across the bridge on Isobel Island.

As a warrior, he protected the fledgling settlement from the many dangers of the Trollsbay. As a guide, he led the city’s intrepid merchants into the interior to map the rivers and trade routes.

Having no children of her own, Lady Isobel took to the insatiably curious ruinborn, teaching him of the lands she and her people came from, their history, their gods, and why they had sailed across the perilous waters to find a new home.\n\nAs he grew into manhood, he passed the trials to become a Brave, but was just as adept at wielding the Cannorian musket as a Jayek bow, the steel sword as well as the wooden spear. He adopted the Roilsardi style of dress, and married a human woman, Adra of Basilfield. Being able to inhabit two cultures and languages comfortably laid the foundation for his entry into politics. When the right to vote was enshrined for the Jayek, they looked to him as the one best suited to represent their interests to the newcomers.

One such commodity adds a new sound to the cacophony: the clink of chains, and the groans of captives chafing in their shackles.\n\nThe market-goers are momentarily silent seeing the first slaves ever to be brought to the Tower Street auction blocks, prodded by a Vertesker overseer into pens shared with pigs and cattle. A child cries at the sight of the orcs in chains. As if on cue, the market resumes its gritty symphony, as if nothing strange or tragic had just happened. Added to the chorus are the slippery aristocratic drawl of a Marlliander merchant, bidding “ten crowns for the lot of brutes”, followed by the squeak of a competitor from Thílvis raising her five crowns more.\n\nFor the orcs standing silently amidst the noise, their proud warcries and boisterous songs around the campfire are a distant memory, their home back in Escann as out of reach as a dream upon waking.

All paid tribute, none starved in the winter. He held sway in the District not due to his descent from the great Greentide clan of Bladebreaker, but from fear, respect, and loyalty.\n\nNow a different group was coming to his shop, keen to take something from him: his liberty, or his life. The red and white-uniformed Republican Guard moved down Rose Street and fanned out into Varok Square. Watching Bakbur and the police stare each other down were wizened Escanni orcs, half-orc scrappers weilding clubs and bricks, and every other resident of the Bridge District.\n\nRising the waters as a grimy shadow to its namesake’s grandeur, the District was the proper place for Isobelin’s orcs and half-orcs in the minds of the City’s elites. Muck dredged from the Strait, scrap iron, spare lumber and masonry: shaky ground for their ramshackle huts, soon replaced by tight-packed tenements. Their bodies, claimed by flood, fire, collapse and disease, strengthened the foundation as well. With their poverty followed crime - gambling, prostitution, and a pervasive disregard for the rule of law, a law which left them with so little that many felt they had nothing to lose. The shantytown became the place for respected citizens to seek cheap thrills and indulge base vices.\n\nOne such citizen, the son of a Tower Street broker, was the cause of this display of force. A degenerate gambler, he owed debts all over the city. Bakbur was the only creditor bold enough to collect with the threat of a razor’s edge. The boy was unharmed, yet the city’s elites would not tolerate the assault - orc leaders like him were supposed to keep the lid on the pot, not hasten the boil. The Captain of the Guard was summoned, orders were issued, and as dawn broke he found himself before the Barber of Varok Square. He faced a choice. His life, those of his men, and the lives of all around him rested in his hands."

Contracted by the Asra Bank to design and build the vault of their newly established branch in Asraport, his work was acclaimed for its pragmatic hardiness with an angular dwarven aesthetic flair. He had his hand in constructing many other structures in the city and port, and he made a small fortune from the Bank’s patronage.\n\nHowever, Bardur’s greatest works were to be built on a small, rocky island even further to the west, recently settled by some Roilsardi led by a rich widow. In Isobelin, he found the place where he could materialize his dreams into stone and iron.\n\nDesigning City Hall, re-engineering the Twin Batteries, and retrofitting the Navy Yard using innovations he developed in Asraport, he left an indelible mark on these foundational institutions of the city.\n\nBut his crowning achievement was undoubtedly the Twin Bridges of Isobelin. True to his dwarven heritage, and despite his wide travels, he had a lifelong distaste for boat rides, and wanted more than anything to walk on solid stone from Isobel Island and Jayekmoot to mainland North Aelantir. Financed by loans from Tower Street, a municipal bond, and his own wealth, he began work on two great bridges over the Jayek and Isobel Straights - gruelling and dangerous work done by enslaved orcs. Many drowned draining the cofferdams, or were mangled when great blocks of masonry came loose.\n\nTen years later, two masterworks of granite and wrought iron rose from the water. The Twin Bridges were truly the first structures to distinguish Isobelin as a city unlike any other. Finally resting on his laurels at the age of 192, his family and business became as permanent a fixture in Isobelin as any structure of his making. Indeed, Cannorian dwarves would brave the sea for the chance to apprentice at Bardur and Sons. Far from the Luna, his line was Clan Riverstone no longer. On the shores of Isobelin, Clan Bridgemaker arose."

Here, the rights jealously guarded by the elite few would be enjoyed by all - to pursue happiness and wealth in a fine new land. All born on Isobelin’s shores and those that came of their own free will would know this freedom.\n\nHowever, freedom without governance is chaos, and without being enshrined in a social contract, these liberties would wither away under pressure from the old order. Taking inspiration from the writings of the Esteemed Widow, the City Council memorialized these rights in a charter, a beacon for thousands overseas suffering at the point of a warlord’s sword or the tip of a magician's wand. The right to settle the land, and conduct commerce and profit off of it. The right to participate in the life of the city, vote in elections, and to be free of the burdens and strictures of feudalism. The right to live as one’s own man or woman, of any race or religion, with equal protection under the law.\n\nOf course, those who broke these laws would lose these rights, swiftly and permanently. And those who arrived in Port Isobel not of their own will would receive vastly different treatment than those who did.

She had an adventurer’s yearning for new horizons, so when news came of a burgeoning, uproariously innovative theater scene with an insatiable demand for costumes in a growing city on the Trollsbay, she pilfered twenty bolts of silk from her family’s storehouse, and made haste across the sea.\n\nSkyweaver faced no local competitors worthy of the name. Soon, theater directors took out personal loans to commission just a single piece of hers. Rich theater patrons followed suit. Her silk-weaving business on the mainland became the nucleus of a growing community of young elves devoted to the arts of fashion.\n\nOver time, her apprentices became competitors. Her life came to a characteristically dramatic end at the hand of one such jealous competitor, rumored to be a spurned lover. Her tremendous talent cut short by her lurid, salacious death at the young age of 96 made her remaining works sought after treasures - no Isobeliner could be counted among the city’s elite without a Leslindel original in her closet."

Burned into the Cannorian mind in the flames of the Greentide, this reputation is one the orcs may never hope to outlive and grow past in the Old World. Thus, the Escannis have no qualms clapping them in chains and sending them down the Alen to the Black Tower, to be sold like so many bushels of wheat. Most of our citizens bear little love towards them, and many have made quite a tidy sum trading in them as a commodity or using their labor. But in their sojourn on our shores, they have proven that an orc can have just as much the spirit of striving, of chasing dreams of a better future, as any human or elf or dwarf who finds themselves in our City.\n\nNone more so than the fabled Thorn Tusks. Azdahak the Black purchased them to serve as shock troops for the punitive expedition against Mykx, promising good rations, sturdy weapons, and clean clothing. Bringing him twenty gnoll ears would earn them a cabin boy’s wages, and after fifty, manumission. Wrapping barbed metal wire around their tusks, they fell on the corsair galleons in battle after battle. In one engagement with the Scourge Fleet, they boarded and captured twelve ships in two hours. Hundreds of dog ears fell at the feet of a smiling Azdahak. Their shackles fell too, and Port Isobel greeted them with cheers on their return.\n\nSome chose to use their new freedom and earned wages to set up homesteads up the Lady’s River, or open small shops in the Bridge District. But many chose to return for another tour in the military as freed citizens in the Thorn Tusk Brigade. They kept the barbed wire as part of their uniform, but earned a new reputation for themselves - soldiers, fearsome and disciplined."

If one is looking to evade harbor fees and customs duties, then a gnollish contact in the Dockyards is essential. This has escalated into a problem that can no longer be ignored.

Having learned the ways of piracy from his captors, he struck the black flag for himself with a motley crew of gnolls, humans, dwarves, and halflings.\n\n He became a fearsome but principled buccaneer, raiding ships belonging to Cannorians and gnolls, but never fellow Aelantiri. Lorent, Pearlsedge, and Verne each placed bounties on his head, and he was on the run from cove to cove when an agent from a Tower Street trading firm approached him with an offer: fly the colors of Isobelin and lead her fleets in a punitive expedition against Mykx, and he would receive the legitimacy and protection of the Esteemed Widow. All prizes and plunder he captured would belong to him.\n\nThe last cask of gunpowder was hoisted up into hold, the last orc slave-soldier clambered onto the deck, and the last anchor was pulled up.

Wisely investing his considerable fortune in commercial ventures on the sea and in the city itself,many ordinary citizens worked for him, knowing him to be a shrewd but fair employer.

Those dreaming of vast fortunes saw the trade in and labor of enslaved orcs as the key to their wealth. Those dreaming of living in liberty and pursuing happiness could not help but see the orcs, despite their reputation, as people just like them. Hence, those born on Isobelin’s soil or coming of their own will would enjoy the Charter’s rights, while those who arrived against their will had none.\n\nThis uneasy compromise has masked a growing tension, and growing with it has been a community of freeborn orcs and half-orcs, who have begun to organize and agitate for their enslaved brethren.

Several commissioners have suggested we revisit the terms under which the Jayek joined with us at the beginning of the 16th Century. Cannorians were granted rights to hunt, fish and garden. These rights should be extended, they argue, to accommodate the changing city - a euphemism for flattening hills, draining marshes, and clear cutting forests so that roads can be laid and plots parceled out for construction. Their opponents on the Commission argue vociferously against this, particularly the lone Jayek Commissioner.
