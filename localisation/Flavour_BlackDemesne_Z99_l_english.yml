In the Demesne, it is magical ability and mystic intuition that mark a person's worth, not their bloodline. Magic users are full citizens of a harsh but mostly fair state. On the other hand, non-magicians live a life of total legal subjugation and suppression, though some manage to accrue considerable influence nonetheless."

 black_demesne.1.d:0 "At the end of a grand hall stands the Ascending Dragon, the rising Acolyte who is about to take the throne. Light coming in through stained glass windows casts multi-colored reflections across the stone floor below. The assembled crowd of dignitaries, who include a number of mundane mortals, look at one another nervously as a dozen junior mages posted around the hall begin to chant invocations. The Acolyte smiles. Fear, of course, is the objective.\n\nAll at once, the dozen mages make a simultaneous motion with their hands and the room is plunged into total darkness. It is as though the sun has stopped shining and the essence of night itself were brought into the room. The low, menacing voice of the Ascending Dragon begins its own chant, and a hundred little balls of flame begin to dance through the air, casting flickering orange-red illumination across the shocked faces of the assembled witnesses.\n\nSlowly, they converge into the form of letters, a script only the initiated can understand: 'Behold the one who commands the world'. Cries of acclamation and praise ring out from the gathered magicians, and the mundanes sink farther in their chairs, as if hoping to avoid notice. The Dragon is Risen, and a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is born."

 black_demesne.5.d:0 "Whispers from the lesser mages at court have filtered back to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Concerns have been rising that the amount of land directly held by the Throne risks the collapse of the Demesne, just like the historical destruction of the realm of the Heretic. The idea that we must not hang the future of the Mystic Revolution on the shoulders of one person is the governing philosophy of the Black Demesne, and it seems that the time may have come to establish a new Dominion under a subject Acolyte."

 black_demesne.7.db:0 "Alas, our agents have failed to the origin of the magical surge in [province.GetName].

 black_demesne.8.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has stunned all the world! In an effort to avoid Jorgurem fleeing where the Demesne could not reach, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] came up with the plan to challenge the dragon to a duel. Refusing such a haughty challenge from a mortal mage would grievously wound the pride and honor that are so central to a dragon's identity, and he was compelled to accept, assuming that he would make quick work of our glorious monarch.\n\nFortunately for us, the dragon miscalculated, not understanding the power of our dark intuition. The battle was hard-fought, but the glorious destructive power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] tore the land asunder and struck Jorgurem down. Villages dozens of miles away reported feeling the shaking of the earth in the aftermath of the battle. The exaltation of the mortal races continues, and we cast down all relics of our former subjugation. All the world lays at the feet of the Ascendant Dragon, who carries us all through fear and discord!"

In an effort to avoid Jorgurem fleeing where the Demesne could not reach, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] came up with the plan to challenge the dragon to a duel. Refusing such a haughty challenge from a mortal mage would grievously wound the pride and honor that are so central to a dragon's identity, and he was compelled to accept, assuming that he would make quick work of our glorious monarch.\n\nUnfortunately, though the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was able to wound Jorgurem, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was in turn grievously harmed. We cannot be sure if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will live, and if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does, it is unlikely that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will ever fully recover from arcane damage of such magnitude. A temporary setback for the Mystic Revolution, but one that is no doubt humiliating for the Skull Throne."
 black_demesne.9.a:0 "Vengeance shall be ours!"
 
 black_demesne.10.t:0 "Arise"
 black_demesne.10.d:0 "The frigid air bites against the skin of the mages, who stand along the circumference of a massive circle laid out with large stones. The circle encompasses the mostly-frozen body of Jorgurem, the once-great dragon brought low by the power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. At the cardinal points of the circle stand the Acolytes, and standing at Jorgurem's head is the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], wielding the great scepter that had taken the work of so many talented artisans.\n\nSlowly, the dozen mages reach out to one another across the fabric of creation, linking their minds with thin threads of arcane connection. They begin to chant, redirecting the raw force of nature itself to the scepter. The power flowing through the circle working's channel is first a trickle, then a flood, and finally a torrent. Two of the weakest mages in the circle lose their grip on the spell, and, before anyone has had time to notice, a greenish-blue flame has consumed their bodies and left only ashes.\n\nFinally, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] reaches out with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] scepter and touches the dragon's head, a rush of power flowing through the body of the dragon and binding it to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. The beast opens its eyes, staring directly at [Root.Monarch.GetName]. It unfolds its wings and, in an unnatural, shaky motion, opens its mouth. A single word utters forth from that enormous maw. 'Master.'"

 black_demesne.12.a:0 "Damnation!"
 
 black_demesne.13.t:0 "Secrets of the North"
 black_demesne.13.d:0 "The frigid north is a land of many secrets, mysteries thawing out over time just as the ice thaws in the warmer summer months. A focused and well-attuned magician will see the hints of one of these mysteries as they journey through the tundra. The low-level buzzing of the chaotic arcane background forces begins to grow and become more consistent, but only in one direction, as though it were tugging us toward some great source of disruption.\n\nAttempts to simply follow this tugging are frustrated, however, by some sort of interference — perhaps a masking spell. A circle of mages local to the area have figured out a broad region the disruption could be coming from, and have approached our agents with a plan to look into this situation."
 black_demesne.13.a:0 "We should investigate"
 
 black_demesne.14.t:0 "The Surge"
 black_demesne.14.d:0 "We have attempted to scry the area of the disruption, an approach that was giving us modest results until an apparent reaction between our scrying spells and whatever force is masking the searched-for location. A vast surge of arcane energy was momentarily detected, ripping apart our scrying spells and temporarily allowing us to narrow the location of our quarry. Repeating this feat is only moderately dangerous and should allow us to identify a location small enough to search in person."
 black_demesne.14.a:0 "Assemble a search party!"
 
 black_demesne.15.t:0 "The Ibevari Elves"
 black_demesne.15.d:0 "The elves of Ibevar create a difficult conundrum for the Skull Throne. They are magical beings, which in theory should entitle them to the status of citizenship in the Demesne. However, having large minority populations could create social and political difficulties that would distract from our pursuit of magical supremacy. They are not mere animals, like the mundanes, but it may be a regrettable necessity to pursue harsher measures. On the other hand, we could make use of them as a resource if we are willing to take the risk."
 black_demesne.15.a:0 "Create a protected Elven reserve"
 black_demesne.15.b:0 "Enroll them in the army"

 black_demesne.15.e:0 "Their magical blood could be used in experiments"
 
 black_demesne.16.t:0 "Damescrown, A Crown of Gold"

The next stage will be to begin using the tower in earnest, turning it from a ruin of an age past into a living testament to the ascendancy of the magical.

It may be more productive to simply circumvent this problem and use these people as a non-citizen labor force.\n\nTwo solutions have been proposed for this: the 'Smoke Tax' plan, which would lend these workers to the coal magnates in exchange for greatly increased taxes on the coal industry, and the so-called 'Slave River' plan, where a regular flow of slaves from the region will be imported to Castonath, with the remainder being allowed to continue breeding and producing the next generation of slaves."

It will be impossible to extinguish their knowledge without extinguishing the entire race, and that is certainly an option. More moderate advisors to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have suggested a different path, however — we ought to use their knowledge of artifice to create new, well-regulated magical technology that enhances the capabilities of true, honest magicians.

The use of a reasonable scepter can grant a mage capacities far beyond a normal body, and the greatest scepters can provide a focus and store power for an entire circle of mages.\n\nWith this growing demand, a true scepter industry has begun to spring up, and artisans are able to produce scepters upon request for those who have the funds and capacity to arrange for the requisite materials — fortunately, the Deepwoods and other sources of magical wood work excellently. Mass deforestation of mystic trees has made the price of materials fall dramatically and even regular mages are able to have these items which were once reserved for the most powerful."

The first is the home of the criers, those who carry all the news of the world on the whispers of their lips and the ringing of their bells. The latter is a more secret home, a home for crime and deviance. An outside observer would be forgiven for thinking that only the first would attract the grace of the Skull Throne, as opposed as it is to the corruption of the old world. But, indeed, both have great roles to play in the construction of the new order which awaits.\n\nThere will always be a flow of information, and so it is better to be he who controls it. This much, the world already knows. But the Acolytes have another insight, equally key: so too will there always be deviants and crime, and so it is better to be he who controls them, as well. In light and dark, above ground and below, the apparatus of state will hear and speak all things to all peoples, it shall be the center of life.\n\nIn this way, all are given their Purpose, and all are given their place. So long as the end of the Demesne would be an unthinkable tragedy for all, so too shall none raise their hand against the order that has been created. This is the logic of the Laws, and so it shall be done. But who shall control this operation? Who shall be the puppetmaster, pulling the strings by which all Cannor dances?"

While our final goal is to integrate many of these creatures, and to elevate the magic potentiates among them to true personhood, they currently cannot be trusted.\n\nThe transplantation of loyal populations, who will be rewarded for emigrating with property seized from the wealthy and powerful, should have a stabilizing influence over the region and make it easier for our networks of control to operate. Furthermore, they bring with them the knowledge of our arcane engineering and modes of governance, such that it will be much easier for the Acolytes to begin the process of connecting the region to the empire-wide system of scrying spells and deterrent necromantic enchantments."

The infighting of the elves and humans over the so-called divine succession of the demiurge Surael has allowed even the monstrous races to gain some foothold in this area, threatening the fragile light of civilization that has managed to stay aflame, if only in flickers.\n\nWe have come to end this. All the privileges, laws, and obligations of the old order have been swept away in favor of the New Laws and Rational Guides, and the agents of the Skull Throne descend upon every township, village, and city with decrees of holy Purpose as established by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s unchallenged law. Freed from the obligation to bicker about the future, the people of Bulwar will finally be able to move forward and focus on the well-being of their families.

 black_demesne.42.t:0 "Far and Wide"
 black_demesne.42.d:0 "The ascendancy of the Black Demesne was one of the most transformational events in world history. For the first time, vast territories representing great wealth were under one banner, economically and socially united. The vestiges of the old order would take many years to die, but in the end they would be reduced to nothing more than quaint local stories and the customs of backwards villages. In its place, a new order focused on personal intuition, mysticism, and magical supremacy would sweep across the Demesne's territory. The Skull Throne, having maintained its supreme authority through the use of vast magical resources, was able to control and direct society in unprecedented ways. For perhaps the first time, the very social and cultural fabric of mortal lives was in the hands of a government, which was able to mobilize and redirect their 'creatures' as best seen fit.\n\nDissent was harshly punished, and many heinous acts were committed both by the government and by members of the mage class. Nevertheless, the hard evidence makes it impossible to deny that the Demesne also brought considerable peace and prosperity, finally fulfilling in their own way what Anbennar once called the Mages' Peace. Regions once torn asunder by constant warfare were given over to the Black Peace, allowing their populations to grow, literacy to rise, and the conversion of many from unskilled labor to skilled artisanship. Natural disasters were controlled or fought against by the state's vast stores of magical resources, saving countless lives.\n\nPerhaps one of the most profound changes engendered by the Demesne was the true equity among magical classes that emerged, and the highly efficient pipeline for those with magical potential to become initiates. It is estimated that, prior to the Demesne, only a third of those with the potential to learn magic would end up using it at all, and fewer still would become true mages. These numbers rose dramatically under the rulership of the Acolytes, with nearly eighty percent of those with potential becoming full mages, and almost all gaining the capacity to wield minor magics. Of course, this only heightened the discrimination and disdain the 'mundanes' faced, with their oppression seemingly justified by the fact that mages were rising from every region and every stratum of society.\n\nIn the long run, the Demesne would represent a dramatic slowdown in the development of non-magical technology, as well as in artifice. While regions outside the sway of the Skull Throne would foster new technical and scientific developments, the Demesne remained set in their mystical ways. Nevertheless, the drive to solve many of these same problems with the power of magic alone drove the fastest expansion in magical abilities in history, including a unified theory of magical metaphysics that mapped out the boundaries of what magic was, what it was capable of, and how it functioned with unprecedented precision."

In order to gain that influence and power, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors have developed the so-called 'Black Blueprint'.\n\nThe blueprint lays out a long-term, century-spanning plan to expand the Demesne's borders both internally and externally. Externally, the Demesne will continue marching on in its conquest of the surrounding regions, burning down the vestiges of what once was and building what will be. This is the part of the blueprint that will be public knowledge. The internal blueprint, however, remains a secret of the mage class. They have developed plans to probe at the boundaries of magic, to develop a scientific and rational understanding of mystical forces, and to touch those things once called 'dangerous' and 'forbidden'. By pursuing both objectives, the Mystic Revolution will tear the world asunder and build it anew in the vision of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 black_demesne.44.d:0 "In most of the world, spatial relationships are consistent and naturally follow certain laws. The only way to bend or break these laws, as far as we understand, is for a mage or mystic being to apply arcane force to the problem. The dealings of the planes has always presented a challenge for all existing models of metaphysics, as the semi-permanent 'Verdant Veil' of spatial separation seems to disconnect, at times, the Deepwoods from the more mundane parts of the world: the Prime Material Plane.\n\nWe have managed to map the boundaries of the Verdant Veil and understand where we can enter and exit it from without harming ourselves or our equipment. While investigation reveals this 'Veil' is indeed powered by arcane energies, we can identify no conscious source that could be generating it — nor could we fathom a being so powerful as to constantly maintain a spell of such scope for what seems to be hundreds, if not thousands, of years - no, even the fey are at its whims. Mysteries beget knowledge, and the application of Intuition to the questions of the arcane is a rite more sacred than any other. Accordingly, the Acolytes have begun selecting a team of promising initiates to begin an investigation of the 'Veil' and the other unusual magical properties of the Deepwoods."

However, the Deepwoods possesses not just many of these same materials, but often vastly superior versions.\n\nFor example, animal venom is often required for enchantments of a destructive nature. Initial reports from our scouting parties have revealed that not only does the Deepwoods contain venomous animals in vast abundance, but that the venom itself is imbued with arcane power that should make it more potent and longer-lasting. Capturing and harvesting these creatures should allow us to fuel not just our current level of spellcraft, but leave room for considerable expansion besides. Perhaps, one day, we may even be able to breed these creatures as the mundanes breed cattle."

 black_demesne.46.t:0 "The Verdant Secret"
 black_demesne.46.d:0 "The problem of the Veil that surrounds the Deepwoods has puzzled some of the finest minds among our magical class for quite some time. It seems to be a naturally occurring spell that sustains itself with no obvious source of magical energy, nor with any conscious mind directing it, not even that of the Fey. While self-sustaining abjurations are known to be possible — indeed, they are frequently used for a variety of purposes in Castonath — such abjurations are typically limited to small or precise effects, as they can only draw in ambient magical energy from their immediate environment. The spell on display in the Veil, on the other hand, is many orders of magnitude greater than what we previously believed to be the upper bound on self-sustaining abjurations.\n\nThis paradox has only deepened as continued investigation has yielded additional information, none of which seemed to fit into our past experience or our esoteric understanding of magical mechanics. However, as each piece of the puzzle fell into place, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was able to supply the great intuition necessary to uncover the solution: the only possible explanation is that the Veil is not being generated under the magical laws of our world, but another plane entirely!\n\nWe had always thought the Deepwoods to be a part of the Prime Material where the Feyrealm leaked through, but no, the Deepwoods itself is in fact not part of this plane at all, but instead a true part of the Feyrealm forcibly encroaching on the stability of the Prime Material! This indeed explains the Verdant Link, which connects various parts of the Deepwoods, is in fact an entirely physical phenomenon — just under a separate system of physics. The spatial topography of the Deepwoods, and thus the Feyrealm is not a flat plane superimposed on a sphere, as the Prime Material is, but is instead contorted according to the alien geometry of the Feyrealm - something completely at odds with the foundations of the Prime Material. Modeling the Feyrealm is an incredibly difficult task, but it is now simply a matter of creating navigational enchantments to translate the geometry into shapes more comprehensible to our minds."

 black_demesne.47.d:0 "The Acolytes emerge through the Veil into the Feyrealm for the first time, at least on purpose. Encased in the humming, distorted light of a shielding spell, they cannot quite see things as they are. But once the initiates have cleared the surrounding area of any possible threat, the shield is dropped, allowing their eyes to glimpse the Feyrealm with their own eyes for the very first time.\n\nThe most remarkable thing is the explosion of colors that abound. Not just greens, but purples, blues, and reds seem to cover the forest as though a dyemaker's workshop had exploded. The unfathomably tall trees are lined with veins of blue that seem to be channeling arcane force through their bark. Birds of dramatic, colorful visage fly overhead, perching on the branches so high up that it is difficult to crane one's head to look at them. Their songs are so sweet, as though it were an avian symphony performing just for them.\n\nIt is as if it is the Prime Discordance - the nature of chaotic magic fundamental to the universe - made flesh.\n\nMoving deeper into the forest, rainbow-colored mushrooms and plants cover the ground, and the party observes a few small rabbit-like creatures with three eyes and butterfly wings landing gently atop large, purplish-yellow ferns to eat their leaves. Suddenly, there is the tell-tale vibrations of magical energy, and without hesitation the party covers itself in a shield. Through the blurry field, they see a larger creature with two horns jutting out of its head pounce into view, a fireball streaking from one of its horns to impact a winged rabbit and singe its fur. The little creature yelps in pain, the flames burning up its wings before it's able to escape, and the predator takes its prize. The party drops their shield to observe more clearly, and one of the Acolytes signals to their initiate scouts. They nod, and in moments an arcane net has grasped the limbs of the predator. \"We will take this one back for examination.\"\n\nThe rest of the expedition goes just as smoothly, and when the group returns to the exit portal, they have collected more than a dozen specimens for experiments, dissection, and analysis. Their little chittering yelps were endearing at first, but have grown annoying, and their mouths are stuffed with cloth gags. \"Dictate this report for dispatch to the Charred Tower: the land is rich, and exploitation of the Feyrealm will begin at the earliest opportunity.\""

 black_demesne.48.d:0 "It has been a long road of hard study and incremental progress to get to this point, but we stand on the precipice of truly unveiling the secrets of the Deepwoods and its mysterious Verdant Veil. In particular, studies of the strange, magic-wielding flora and fauna of the Deepwoods, along with careful dissection of its more intelligent inhabitants, has revealed a peculiar fact: almost all of these creatures exhibit telltale signs of fey influence.\n\nThe existence of the Fey has been known for some time, but all the clues and evidence of history point to a certain set of patterns we find repeated in the organisms before us. The Deepwoods seems to exist in suspension, tied forcefully to our Prime Material, and the eternal tug of the Prime Discordance slowly but surely bringing it to its natural place within the Feyrealm, as though it were a spider's web delicately spun between two trees -useful... but in the grand scheme of things, temporary. This produces the bizarre time-shifting effect noticed in the Deepwoods, as while it is spatially contiguous with our world, its physics, and therefore passage of time, derive from the Feyrealm - no doubt confirming such strange occurences like travelers spending days in the Deepwoods, but emerging years later.\n\nIn other words, the Deepwoods is almost like an outpost of the Fey in our world, or perhaps it is like a human living in a house fit for halflings: converted to accommodate something not wholly here: the fey's alien minds and their natural capacity for magic, which is reflected in the creatures of the Deepwoods themselves. The technique is fascinating, as it reveals to us the possibility of creating spaces linked to our world but which obey alien laws, and the possibilities of manipulating the very laws of nature reveals how contingent and fragile our own world truly is. With this information in hand, progress on 'unsolvable' problems should now be possible if one abandons attachments to our world and tries to solve them using novel geometries and other alternative assumptions."

What greater delusion could there be than to believe that this is a place to be envied? What wretched thoughts must fill the rotten minds of the corrupted souls here? No, it is not right to judge them, for their chains have not been broken. The task of bringing them to truth must fall to us.\n\nThis city is a viper pit, filled with those who seek nothing but their own advancement in a false system of ranks, prestige, and order. Everywhere, the universal law of Purpose is mocked. None seek growth by taming that which is greater than themselves, for even their religion is but a way for the nihilistic scum to worship only the mundane. They revel in it, smelling the putrid stench of this corrupted order and declaring it to be sweet as flowers. This, too, shall be corrected.\n\nThe first thing to be crushed is the temples. There is no saving those so dedicated to the preservation of our intangible enemy, and so the lives of those who dwell within are ended by our mercy in front of all. Next are the Twelve Families. The greatest among them must be ended, and the rest must be humbled. That too is done. There are the mages, of course. Some are won over, but others try to resist. It is a shame to execute other persons of sacred Intuition, but those so deluded can not be allowed to live.\n\nNext to be tamed is the underworld. The necromantic enchantments which respond to crime elsewhere in the Demesne are shortly emplaced here, and the rising bodies of the dead hunt down our targets with little difficulty. They, too, are brought into alignment with their holy Purpose. Before long, all who still live in Bulwar have been brought to see the truth of our ways, and they see now the staircase stretching out before them, one which will carry them from their lowest lows to the glory of the Prime Discordance. Even if they do not yet truly believe, they will, for the nature of reason is that its conclusion is inarguable once one sees the truth of the premises on which it is contingent."

When they arrive, those who are magical potentiates are given over to the care of the Academy. Those who are not are instead trained in whatever use they may best have. Some are forgers, artisans, tradesmen. Others are scribes, agents, spies. Some form a group trained for years to serve as the personal enforcers of one of the Acolytes or a powerful initiate. Those who cannot be trained, those who cannot be made loyal, those who are broken beyond repair — even these we can find a Purpose for. For there is no end of need for test subjects, for experiments, or for entertainment for the various mystical beasts kept and bred in Castonath.

Powerful mages identify potential pupils, and are rewarded by the Throne for each student they can raise to a basic level of magical competence as measured by a yearly examination. While this process was effective for small numbers of mages, it does not come close to achieving our goal of raising every single potentiate into a wielder of mystic Intuition.\n\nIn order to achieve this objective, the various esoteric texts that have long been used by magicians of the darker paths have been standardized into several textbooks of black magic. Some older initiates of moderate magical talent but keen academic ability have been recruited to serve as professors in a hidden university of arcane knowledge, known as the Academy of Shadows. The Academy's actual location is secret — in fact, it is not a single building at all. Several dozen minor, underground complexes of libraries, classrooms, dormitories and laboratories can be found around Castonath, preventing the school from becoming a target for potential 'heroes'.

 black_demesne.53.d:0 "The Deepwoods is filled with all manner of creatures, but most fascinating are those higher order mundane creatures who can make a good pretense at intuition. There are elves and goblins and others we are familiar with, of course, though their physiology and minds have been shaped and twisted in interesting ways by even relatively short periods, historically speaking, of living in the Deepwoods. Dissection and experimentation have resulted in a number of advancements in alchemy and potion-making, which can replicate the effects of what we have termed 'feyification' outside the magical environs that naturally produce the transformations.\n\nMuch more interesting than these creatures, however, are the satyrs, as well as the myriad of other fey creatures in the forest. Their very being appears to be magical in a way not observed even with elves: they are linked wholly to the Prime Discordance - to the chaotic and wild magics fundamental to our universe. Suspending a dozen satyr subjects in anti-magic fields resulted in involuntary motion, seizures, and eventually death. Even more fascinating, attempting to contain them in anti-magic fields was vastly more difficult than it would normally be, suggesting that magic in some way is naturally drawn to the creatures. This makes them, and the other intelligent creatures we have taken from the Deepwoods, ideal test subjects. This will do away with the need to use other mundane mortals, such as non-magical humans, in our experiments. Perhaps we can one day even establish a breeding program to ensure sustainability of the resource, though the relatively high intelligence of the creatures has thus far meant that they do not do well in captivity, even when well-fed and provided with appropriate recreation in a sufficiently large enclosure."

Then, there is the Necromantic Duel, where each mage controls duelling undead armies in a contest of power, enchantment use, and military tactics. These are the lesser events, and are primarily used for intimidation, status, and public prestige, as a win in the earlier duels can soften the blow of a loss in the final duel. Finally, the crowd clears out before the extremely dangerous main event: the Personal Duel, in which each mage attempts to kill the other until submission is signaled via use of a special shielding spell. Fatalities should theoretically be rare, but they are possible, and become even moreso given the stakes: the winner of the Blackpurgis is the greatest among them.

Similarly, we can use the Deepwoods as a bridge between our realm and theirs. While it won't allow us to physically invade the Feyrealm in earnest, nor would it be wise for us to do so, we can place spatial anchor points from our world to pull on the wild magical energy from the Feyrealm, which exists in quantities vast beyond our wildest imagination.\n\nOur project to develop these anchor points, large obelisks of conductive metal encased in dark stone known as the Nine Eternal Pillars, has recently been completed. Our initial tests have proven to be a success, and a torrent of energy flows freely from the Feyrealm without seeming to drain any of our own environment. We cannot yet use this energy effectively, as it cannot be stored or safely drawn upon, so we have simply set up a loop to send it back into the Feyrealm for now. Nevertheless, the proof of concept and its implications have left the mage classes of the Demesne in a mood for extravagant celebration, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ordered a new annual holiday for the mage classes to mark this day. This celebration is to be known as the 'Feyfeast', where the mages will dine together on exotic plants and animals from the Deepwoods, and the greatest chefs in all Cannor will be invited to Castonath to have their chance at working with these extraordinary ingredients."

Instead, it needs to be collected, stored, and made available for later use.\n\nTo that end, we have developed a plan to map out the roots of the ancient World Tree, long destroyed in the Prime Material by Castan Beastbane, vast underground tunnels that travel through the entire Deepwoods. Once the arcano-organic debris left behind by the corpse of the tree is fully excised, these tunnels should be cleared of any interference. We will then be able to create vast underground rivers of liquified, pure magic, all flowing to the center of the forest where the proud tree's trunk had stood for untold eons. However, mapping these roots will be difficult.

The more difficult engineering is creating an access point that will allow this much power to be channeled without destroying the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] while also ensuring that it cannot simply be used by any given hostile mage to unmake our entire project.

How the hubris of our forebears belied their total ignorance! Even so, there has always been a distant peak, far out of reach. The power of the demiurges themselves, those worshipped as gods by the unenlightened mundanes, has always been just out of our grasp. First we thought it undesirable, then we thought it impossible. Now, however, we see the nature of true power.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is attended by every initiate and Acolyte in the Demesne, whose combined talents are necessary to power the reality protection sigils preventing the well from ripping a hole in our world. Any mistake could bring a new apocalypse that would, perhaps, be on par with the Day of Ashen Skies itself. Furious testing and hours upon hours of fervent practice have ensured that this will not occur — but one can never be sure that the apocalypse will not come until the work is done.\n\nFinally, [Root.Monarch.GetName] descends the crystalline stairs leading down into the Well, slowly submerging into a the shimmering purplish-blue pool. Power begins to be drawn, and the sudden rush of arcane force seems to deaden the senses of the whole world. It is as if no other magic even exists, as though all the mundane world until now has been devoid of true power. Screams emerge from the form of the Ascendant Dragon as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] begins to drown, thrashing wildly within the whirlpool of arcane liquid - like the Floodborn that bore Escann its countless Witch-Kings. The mere physical body of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] breaks past its limitations and is ripped asunder, blood mixing with the pool of magic. The initiates look on in horror, but the inward flow of magic continues. Power continues to rush into the well from the tunnels below, and more and more pooling before them. It is power worthy of a God, concentrating in on some single point far below the surface. Finally, the last trickles of power coalesce into a single, solid form, shaped like a crystalline egg, or perhaps a cocoon.\n\nThen the darkness comes. It is not the simple parlor trick of darkness that has been used at prior ascensions. It is not a spell at all, in fact. The hair of the initiates stands on end as they realize this fact. It is as though the light has been physically extinguished. In fact, it would be impossible to distinguish from blindness if it were not for the persistent cool purple-blue glow of the magic chrysalis in the Well below. They simply continue their job of preventing the End of All Things, though it is difficult to keep it up as cracks begin to appear on the surface of the object. Then, it shatters. Something, a being in humanoid form, emerges, shining a brilliant purplish-blue and casting enough light by which to see the world. The forest around them is transformed, much of the surrounding flora dying and withering away. Then, the being, which slowly reverts to the naked the form of [Root.Monarch.GetName], speaks, with a voice so deep and loud it shakes the very ground."

 black_demesne.65.d:0 "The beliefs of the old order are not merely harmless superstition or confused delusion. They are an active set of lies designed to shackle the natural intuition of the mortal races. To combat this, the Skull Throne has taken the diffuse and frequently contradictory spiritualism of the esoteric texts, as well as the practical political objectives of the state, and formulated a new faith to be known as the 'Black Doctrine'. This faith is directly controlled from Castonath's Charred Tower, but it is based on a real and genuine undercurrent of true religious feeling.\n\nThe Doctrine does not reject the existence of deities. In fact, it is a point of doctrine that extremely powerful beings have emerged from the primal forces. However, these beings are not worthy of being worshipped — instead, they are derisively known as the 'demiurges', who have crafted the old order and all its religions as they currently stand to keep mortals in obscured ignorance. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the Acolytes are set out as models of perfected mortals who have sharpened their gift of Intuition and pierced the veil of illusion that keeps the soul in chains. In an inversion of the demiurges, they are not naturally born as deities or magically powerful individuals but through their works have made themselves worthy of being worshipped as gods.\n\nWhile the old beliefs are not yet officially outlawed, generous advantages are granted to organizations that preach the Black Doctrine, as well as the individuals who teach it. As a result, it has begun to spread like wildfire in the core territories of the Demesne, not in the least due to how those who are true believers are far less likely to end up on the wrong side of a magical initiate."

 black_demesne.66.d:0 "It was a big day for the Seven Stones architectural firm, and for House Alsegard in particular. The Alsegards were a mostly mundane family who had retained some degree of wealth and prominence in the time since the Ascension, and still had a moderate amount of property thanks to a few magical family members. Nevertheless, their status had declined considerably — until now. Karos the Enchanter, one of the Demesne's most influential initiates, had sought partners for a venture that would use physical enchantments to create architecture that would be impossible without the aid of magic. The discovery of the self-sustaining enchantment had theoretically made such buildings possible some time ago, but there were never enough mages concentrated in one place where such a frivolous display of power would be of much use. Now, however, in this place, in this new Castanor, impossible sketches from a mundane architect's daydreams could be made reality.\n\nThat architect, the heir of House Alsegard, stood across the street from newly-finished palatial apartments near the center of the city, soaking in the glory of his creation on its first night open to the public. Tall, arching designs of stone shot upward to the sky. Glass globes seated in the eyes of statues emitted a gentle red glow, giving the appearance of watchful servitors guarding the property. A wrought-iron gate swung open on its own as gawking visitors approached. As the moon rose to a more prominent position in the sky, broad, magical mirrors magnified its light on the building's central triumph: a slowly rotating tower jutting out from the roof, whose stained glass windows reflected the impossible glow of the moon mirrors out to the awed crowd below.\n\nThe building would be open to the public for two weeks, and then it would be sold to the highest bidder. It was only the first of many planned projects, and perhaps the least ambitious. Yes, it was a big day for the firm, but it was a bigger day for Castanor. This was only to be the beginning of a glorious transformation that would see the city as a whole turned into a monument to the impossible."

There is much to be admired in these creatures, who are often less prone to the shackles of the mundane world than even our own human fellows. They have dreamt ambitiously, challenging the obscuring darkness of the demiurges for some time. Nevertheless, they now present a roadblock to our own ascendancy, and nothing can be allowed to distract from that essential, sacred task.\n\nTherefore, we have arrived at two possible solutions. The first is to make extensive use of the resources these creatures can offer, intellectually and otherwise. In so doing, we would merge them with our own projects, bestowing the glorious privilege of Purpose that is the right of all the Demesne's true subjects. Alternatively, we could set aside some small amount of land for them to continue practicing their cultures and traditions undisturbed, safely locked away from where they might do something meaningful — and thus something potentially dangerous. This latter option closes off a number of opportunities, but avoids risk as well. It is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide."

To select just one aspect of a mechanistic, material existence and elevate it to the status of the divine is to revel in one's own ignorance and subjugation to the whims of nature. For us, on the other hand, nature is a tool to be understood and used. It is a servant — something that obeys, rather than something to be obeyed.\n\nWe understand that divinity is a property of magic, and not a property of mere physical things. It is with this conviction that [Root.Monarch.GetName] set out to demonstrate the folly of Bulwar's ways. Devising the spell was a task that required dozens of magical minds, each working on intricately crafting the subspells and minor workings that would come together for this great demonstration of righteous truth. At last, the spell, and the energy necessary to cast it, had been prepared for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s use.\n\nThe Bulwari were shown the depth of their ignorance on the following morning, when those awake let their attention drift to the rising of the sun. Unfortunately for them, it did not rise. A black disc rose in its place, the darkness of true night only yielding in the smallest part to that melancholy twilight of a solar eclipse. This was no ordinary eclipse, of course. The black disc followed the sun for its entire path across the sky, and settled with it below the horizon. Sometimes violence to the psyche is a more effective demonstration of our superiority than violence to the material world. Let the workings of our mages shake the foundations of their faith, and through the outworking of Intuition let the fabric of this wretched old order burn away."

They tried to answer those ancient questions that lie coiled in the heart of each man like a worm. Questions of death, meaning, life and afterlife. But perhaps saddest of all was their attempts to understand what we might call 'brotherhood'. The subjects of the old order have tried many explanations, none of them sufficient. Perhaps brotherhood is what you share with childhood friends. Perhaps it is what you share with those who have the same social class. Perhaps it is what you share with those of the same values and ideas. Perhaps, and this is closest they'd ever gotten, it is what you share with those who serve the same master.\n\nWe, of course, know better. We know that brotherhood is what you share with those who serve the same Purpose. We know that the boundaries between the self and the other melt away like wax beneath a candle when you are engaged in working toward a common goal. If every life is directed toward the same ultimate Purpose, then every life shares in universal brotherhood. It is this fraternity of all under One that is the greatest gift the Demesne gives to its subjects, from the mightiest Acolyte to the lowliest mundane creature of the earth. It is thus only in a spirit of compassionate nobility that we move now to join Bulwar to that same brotherhood."

 black_demesne.70.d:0 "The most powerful spells are collaborative in nature. No matter how powerful a mage is, they are made greater still by the combined efforts of other minds. This is the key insight of the Black Demesne, and it is why we have succeeded where all others have failed. The sorcerous realms of the past saw magic as a magicians's ladder to dominion over others. We, on the other hand, understand that magic is the magicians's ladder to dominion over nature itself. Wherever we go, we seek out those magical potentiates who can join with us in our great circles, who can lend their minds to the task of commanding the universe. The Acolytes themselves exist to provide this service to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nThe Skull Throne does not result from [Root.Monarch.GetName]. It is the result of interlocking circles of collaboration, circles that are not merely magical, but extend to include every single subject of the Demesne, even the mundane creatures. Each circle contributes what little power it has to the furtherance of the greater whole, and through so many such efforts the Skull Throne is invested with ultimate Power. It is this Power, this unstoppable force of united action under One will, that has propelled us to our position of pre-eminence. It is this unstoppable force that will propel us to dominion over all the world. It is this unstoppable force that will shake down that which was to make room for that which will be. And it is this unstoppable force which has brought us here, to Bulwar, to expand our circles to include all who reside here.\n\nWe have succeeded. Those who stand against the Skull Throne in this place are like gnats, mere nuisances that serve nothing but to cause the slightest of inconvenience to something far greater than they, for this nuisance is the closest they can ever come to touching the sublime perfection of Us."

Some rejoice in this sad state of affairs, saying that the disorder and chaos of mortal society is part of what makes life worth living. What they fail to understand, as many so often do, is that a life as a wretched worm is not a life worth living. It is this very confusion that the demiurges have used to keep us in chains for so long. Humans, like ants and mechanisms, can exist in an orderly arrangement, each part in its place, serving the function it is meant to serve.\n\nOrder is an emergent property of a purposeful system. Disorder, on the other hand, is an emergent property of a failing, mindless one. As we burn away the rot, here, and rebuild a new system, people will find that conflicts once thought intractable suddenly melt away. They will feel the liberation of a system that unites them to their fellows, rather than forces them into opposition.

I have come to end those things which have been, and replace them with those which will be. You, too, must forget what you have been, and become something more. You must become something greater than that which was, for that which was leads, always, to the end that those before you have met. There is nothing to be found but death, dust, and ash. But immortality can be yours, my precious creatures, as this is my promise to you: each and every one of you will have a sacred Purpose, a part to play in this grand project of ours. Each and every one of you, no matter how pathetic or how weak, no matter how poor or how wretched, can contribute, and imprint yourself on the eternal order I shall build. I offer you a chance to join with me, to break apart those things which have kept you alone and confused.\"\n\nThe crowd has calmed, and through some combination of fear and genuine persuasion, they begin to shout acclamations to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] departs, followed by a long line of magical initiates. The doors open, revealing that there was seemingly nothing barring them at all. An illusory set of decrees has been projected on the walls of the buildings outside, the first laws creating the new Black Demesne.\n\nAll old classes and privileges have been abolished. There are now only two groups: people of intuition, which is to say the mage class, and the other 'mundane creatures', which is to say everyone else. Spelled out, in clear detail, are the attendant rights of each. There is much weeping, then, but in time, an acceptance of affairs will set in. The people of Castonath will come around, and they will see the path that the Ascending Dragon has traveled to forge this out of the chaos. And in that acceptance, they will touch the barest pieces of the Prime Discordance, those little shards of chaos they can handle without shattering their little minds, and it will be the most glorious ecstasy one can be given — true Purpose, true Service, true Victory.

Still, many at court feel that it is time to add an artistry to our process, a real craftsmanship befitting our stature as superior beings. It is in this mindset that Operation Overseer is conceived. As one would expect, ships have been assembled, forces have been redeployed, and initiates have been prepared to take command of that part of our vast horde which will be transplanted to North Sarhal. Our approach is where the flair kicks in: ships with their masts furled, propelled along by the active manipulation of the ocean behind it, shielded vessels which approach without wind and yet at incredible speed.

Already the staff of the Onyx Tower are abuzz with excitement, having already assumed the operation will succeed and prematurely beginning wild speculation on how Bulwar ought to be governed. But there is still a war to win, after all, and those more practical challenges are the ones occupying the Acolytes and [Root.Monarch.GetName].

She brought them in with promises that she could give them something even greater than the long lives of the elves. They were given over to a state that would come to be known as vampirism: immortality, contingent on living shrouded in secret and drinking blood like a beast. Her poisoned gift was a noble act, a permanent scar upon the edifice of the demiurges. The vampires would develop traditions, rituals, a whole society -- all the while corrupting the systems that hold up this false world. They were Nichmer's true last gift to this world, a beautiful cancer, forever reminding the liars that their time would come again. Nevertheless, we have not come to scar the old order, but to tear it apart entirely. They will need to give up all that they have been, just as every one of our conquered peoples is made to give up what they have been. Unlike those conquered peoples, however, a vampire who cannot accept our order is a potential threat. We resolved to send a message.\n\nAnd so we began the tedious process of scrying the poor hinterlands of Corvuria for where a vampire's coffin might be secreted away, all the while watching for their schemes and machinations. We traced the lineages from spawn to sire, and, acting as conspicuously as possible, we made sure they would know when we were getting higher up the chain. In becoming part beast, they have allowed themselves to be lured like beasts; when they finally confronted us in the dead of night, we were ready. Our plan lay in enchanted crystals, made through the efforts of brilliant mages completing fantastically intricate workings. These sealed an emanation of suspended daylight, and if their arcane bonds were broken, they would release a searing flash of true light. Ancient vampires withered under repeated exposure to flashes of the cleansing day. We repeated this process a number of times, and while they would eventually catch on, it would be far too late. Only then did we disseminate our offer: if they became flexible, resolved to abandon all their old ways, and pledged their undeath to new masters, they would be spared. Those who refused to kneel before the Acolytes would, sooner or later, be hunted to extinction. And so it was that another proud people became just one more tool for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 acolyte_interaction.11.d:0 "'It is often wrongly believed that the ultimate goal of alchemy is transmutation into gold, as this is trivial for a master of transmutation. It is, however, the most profitable goal of alchemy.' -excerpt from the Alchemic Codex.\n\n[Root.GetName] is a legendary transmutation mage. Breaking one of the norms of the Black Demesne's monetary policy, they have transmuted massive amounts of raw material directly into gold. This has brought them considerable wealth at the expense of causing massive inflation across the Demesne."
 acolyte_interaction.11.a:0 "Curses!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.12.t:0 "Nurturing A New Body"
 acolyte_interaction.12.d:0 "'O Ascending Dragon! May your death be cause for celebration, for your rebirth is at hand!' -excerpt from the Book of the Prime Discordance\n\nThe body is such a fragile thing. Delicate, and prone to failure, it simply cannot be trusted to last an Acolyte for eternity. Nevertheless, the soul must be chained to one of these vessels of flesh to continue affecting the physical world, and so [Root.GetName] has begun the process of growing an empty shell to move into upon their death."
 acolyte_interaction.12.a:0 "A new face for the same old Acolyte."
 
 acolyte_interaction.13.t:0 "Research Stolen"
 acolyte_interaction.13.d:0 "'Be unbound, brothers. Be not distracted by the consideration of the chattering creatures. All that is known is your birthright.' -excerpt from the Black Tablet of Skeljor\n\n[Root.GetName]'s agents have dared to steal the magical research of another Acolyte! Though this cannot be definitively proven, all available evidence points to the same culprit. They will no doubt profit handsomely from this research. Fortune does favor the bold, after all."
 acolyte_interaction.13.a:0 "Delectable secrets..."
 
 acolyte_interaction.14.t:0 "Magical Supremacy"
 acolyte_interaction.14.d:0 "'Prime Discordance, call forth the chorus of chaos to bear witness to your servant, the Ascending Dragon, master of the Twin Forces, wielder of the Thousand Secrets.' -excerpt from the Book of the Prime Discordance\n\nThere is no school of magic that [Root.GetName] has not mastered. A true Acolyte of the esoteric and arcane, their reputation precedes them in any hall dedicated to the pursuit of mystical truths. It is possible they are the single most powerful being on the planet. The Acolyte's glory knows no bounds in the Demesne, and it is difficult for even other Acolytes to seriously challenge their claim to absolute supremacy."
 acolyte_interaction.14.a:0 "A god walks among us!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.15.t:0 "Exchange of Pleasantries"
 acolyte_interaction.15.d:0 "'Acolyte! A Seeker stands before thee. This one bears the Mark, and this one has heard Creation's voice. Beckon, then, your fellow traveler, and may we entreat the Prime Discordance for its blessings.'\n\n[Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] performed the Rite of Peerage, a mystical rite acknowledging another mage that is used to show respect between Dragons Ascending. Though the rite itself has little practical effect, it signals to the rest of the Demesne that the Acolytes and their respective realms have grown closer."
 acolyte_interaction.15.a:0 "I greet thee, Seeker."
 
 acolyte_interaction.16.t:0 "Bond Forged in Silence"
 acolyte_interaction.16.d:0 "'Brothers! Stand with me in the assembly of souls! Lend me your strength, and beckon home the whims of Creation and Negation!' -excerpt from the Tablet of Final Contemplation\n\nMagic is full of unsolved problems — some, like the Dark Matrices, may even be unsolvable. But more common than the unsolvable problems are those which are simply too difficult for even an Acolyte to tackle alone. Two working together, however... such a team is not easily dissuaded from the acquisition of arcane knowledge. Such is the case for [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName]."
 acolyte_interaction.16.a:0 "Ah, wisdom's fruit."
 
 acolyte_interaction.17.t:0 "Secret Research"
 acolyte_interaction.17.d:0 "'In quietude the mind ascends, seeking fragments of union with the universal chaos who all creation obeys. This is the first stone laid on the path to the Prime Discordance. Initiate, listen for it in the quiet moments, where all melts away before the thrumming of Creation's voice.' -excerpt from the Record of Ascension\n\n[Root.GetName] has refused all visitors for several days now, having locked themselves in a laboratory some time ago. This is entirely expected, and the ministers of state know that such activities can only mean one thing: the Acolyte's secret research nears a new breakthrough."
 acolyte_interaction.17.a:0 "The precipice of glory!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.18.t:0 "Secret Research Succeeds"
 acolyte_interaction.18.d:0 "'In quietude the mind ascends, seeking fragments of union with the universal chaos who all creation obeys. Behold the Ascending Dragon, whose form is forged in the Heavens! The chorus acclaims the descent of knowledge.' -excerpt from the Record of Ascension\n\n[Root.GetName] has emerged from scholastic seclusion to lay out a fully-proven theorem demonstrating some finer point of mystical obscura before their closest advisors. This period of research has undoubtedly been a success."
 acolyte_interaction.18.a:0 "Eureka!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.19.t:0 "Secret Research Fails"
 acolyte_interaction.19.d:0 "'In quietude the mind ascends, seeking fragments of union with the universal chaos who all creation obeys. But the Prime Discordance is fickle, and rewards only those of pure dedication for whom all illusions have melted away.' -excerpt from the Record of Ascension\n\n[Root.GetName] has emerged, sullen, from scholastic seclusion. An incomplete and unproven theorem is the only thing they have to show for this period of research. Though this experience may teach them valuable lessons for the years to come, it is a bitter disappointment in the present moment."
 acolyte_interaction.19.a:0 "Alas, such is the burden of knowledge."
 
 acolyte_interaction.20.t:0 "Military Cooperation"
 acolyte_interaction.20.d:0 "'Through blood is iron consecrated, and through blood is union forged. The magician who dwells at the base of the mountain climbs only through brotherhood and accord. Seek in every act a partner whose ties are built on the forge of flesh.' -excerpt from Contemplations of the Mystic Blade\n\n[Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have formalized a deal that will provide for cooperation, information sharing, and strategic partnership between the militaries of the two Acolytes."
 acolyte_interaction.20.a:0 "Such things are here today, gone tomorrow."
 
 acolyte_interaction.21.t:0 "Great Orator"
 acolyte_interaction.21.d:0 "'The thrice-blessed magician is he who masters the magic of men's hearts, who speaks into their soul the burning fire of will.' -excerpt from Wisdom of the Magician's Grove\n\nEach Acolyte is different, and they each have unique strengths and weaknesses. For [Root.GetName], there can be no doubt that an incredible gift for oratory is the primary strength. Delivering fiery speeches promising glory, purpose, and prosperity, one wonders just how far the Acolyte can get on words alone."
 acolyte_interaction.21.a:0 "A remarkable gift."
 
 acolyte_interaction.22.t:0 "Rite of Greeting Goes Well"
 acolyte_interaction.22.d:0 "'Purify yourself in rite and ritual, to see as marked out before you those who carry also the blessings of the Prime Discordance.' -excerpt from the Book of the Prime Discordance\n\nA delegation from [country.GetName]'s realm arrived at the court of [Root.GetName] and participated in the Rite of Greeting, a traditional rite of the Black Demesne in which visitors from another court acknowledge the supremacy of the Acolyte in their own domain, and in return receive promises of protection. Fortunately for the visitors, they performed their duties admirably and have secured a temporary improvement in the relations between [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName]."
 acolyte_interaction.22.a:0 "We are bound together by tradition."
 
 acolyte_interaction.23.t:0 "Rite of Greeting Goes Poorly"
 acolyte_interaction.23.d:0 "'He who acts in the guise of those who have come before burdens himself with the expectation of success. Mark as the fool that initiate who fails to learn the lessons of the thousand elders.' -excerpt from the Book of the Prime Discordance\n\nA delegation from [country.GetName]'s realm arrived at the court of [Root.GetName] and participated in the Rite of Greeting, a traditional rite of the Black Demesne in which visitors from another court acknowledge the supremacy of the Acolyte in their own domain, and in return receive promises of protection. Unfortunately for the visitors, their lack of preparation and unwillingness to acknowledge their host's supremacy offended the Acolyte, who immediately banished them and sent them home. This has offended [country.GetName] and weakened relations between the two Acolytes."
 acolyte_interaction.23.a:0 "How pathetic."
 
 acolyte_interaction.24.t:0 "Mystic Symphony"
 acolyte_interaction.24.d:0 "'Listen closely, child, for the song of all the World can be heard if only the magician listens to the humming of Creation.' - excerpt from the Black Tablet of Skeljor\n\nMusic is one of the great pleasures of the soul. [Root.GetName] has recognized this for many years, but has grown dissatisfied with the mundane and typical concerts. After much time and effort, [Root.GetName] has finally found the solution to this dissatisfaction — a glorious magical symphony that enhances and manipulates the sound of the orchestra while providing an accompanying visual display that emphasizes the emotional content of each piece. The first concert of this new magical orchestra was a private showing for all the Acolytes of the Black Demesne, which was a brilliant success and has greatly increased the reputation and standing of [Root.GetName]."
 acolyte_interaction.24.a:0 "Splendid! Marvelous! Bravo!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.25.t:0 "Financial Acquisition"
 acolyte_interaction.25.d:0 "'The Seventh Initiate was rejected from union with Creation, for his obsession with that which is Above left him blind to those things which transpire Below.' - excerpt from the Failure of the Seventh Initiate.\n\nThe Black Demesne is a land of wonders, but even it has not overcome certain immutable laws of how societies function. Conflict, of course, is one, and all Acolytes are intimately familiar with it. But another of these laws is debt, and some Acolytes, such as [country.GetName], tend to forget that financial constraints bind even the most powerful mystic masters. The misfortune of one Acolyte is typically the fortune of another, and this case is no exception. [Root.GetName]'s comparative frugality has left them in an excellent position to buy out the vast majority of [country.GetName]'s realm."
 acolyte_interaction.25.a:0 "Money is just as real as magic."
 
 acolyte_interaction.26.t:0 "High Stakes Chess"
 acolyte_interaction.26.d:0 "'The realm and the Acolyte are one. Armies are but mere extensions of the Acolyte's body, a faculty to be commanded by their will alone.'\n\nThese are the first words of 'War in the Black Demesne', a long and extensive text widely read by almost the entire elite class. It seems as though two Acolytes have taken this passage very literally, as they showed in what was perhaps the most consequential game of chess ever played. Having agreed to a contest of wits rather than a contest of arms, [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] sat down across the black-and-white board and, through the assent of nothing but their will, made each piece tied to the lives of one of their battalions. Each captured piece represented a hundred deaths or more. Satisfied that the stakes of the game honored their station, the Acolytes played it to its conclusion, wielding the destructive forces of the arcane to claim their prizes of souls. The widow's tears and the orphan's wailing cry are simply facts of life when one serves one's betters. Let this game be a reminder of that, if nothing else."
 acolyte_interaction.26.a:0 "It was a bloody good game, though!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.27.t:0 "Illuminated in Moonlight"
 acolyte_interaction.27.d:0 "'O Prime Discordance, in whom Intuition is illuminated by moonlight, bestow upon this initiate those things kept hidden in shadow.' -excerpt from the Book of the Prime Discordance\n\n[Root.GetName]'s network of informants is, like all servants of the Acolytes, seen as an extension of their person. Using magically enhanced techniques such as the sensory enhancement spells associated with the above incantation, this espionage service has spread out across the Demesne, reporting events from the courts of every Acolyte back home. In this, the mind of [Root.GetName] is well informed about all things, even those that happen in the quiet places and under the cover of darkness."
 acolyte_interaction.27.a:0 "Knowledge is power, indeed."
 
 acolyte_interaction.28.t:0 "Reign of Terror"
 acolyte_interaction.28.d:0 "'O Ascending Dragon, let not the chattering creatures shake your coming roar.' -excerpt from the Book of the Prime Discordance\n\nIt is not exactly a secret that most Acolytes consider mundane, everyday people who have not been initiated into the arcane mysteries to be little better than animals. Nevertheless, as a farmer may be particularly cruel to his livestock, so too has [Root.GetName] become unusually cruel to their subjects. Magic is freely wielded as a tool of domination by those capable, and agents of the state are empowered to summarily execute any 'uncooperative creature' who stands in the way of the swift completion of policy objectives. This black day mars the reputation of the Acolytes among the common people, but intervention would seem improper. It seems to all the world as though these souls will be left to their fate of suffering and subjugation."
 acolyte_interaction.28.a:0 "May they receive the Acolyte's mercy."
 
 acolyte_interaction.29.t:0 "Vow of Friendship"
 acolyte_interaction.29.d:0 "'Seek, then, brothers in the arcane mysteries. A dragon ascends not on its power alone, but is carried through the blessings of fellow travelers.' -excerpt from the Black Tablet of Skeljor\n\n[Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have consecrated a growing friendship through the three-day Rite of Bonding, which forms an empathic link between the two Acolytes. At the end, their sacred vow of friendship and stalwart loyalty is secured through the sacrifice of a hundred healthy animals. Marking each other in the mystically-infused blood, they declare their solemn allegiance for the whole world to see."

Dragons were, of course, beings who are naturally attuned to the Prime Discordant - and could use magic to reshape the world, as the myth tell us. But their time is over. Now we must demonstrate to the world that the new magical order will bring the ascendancy of the mortal races over such relics of the past."
 Z99_scepter_of_scepters_title:0 "Scepter of Scepters"
 Z99_scepter_of_scepters_desc:0 "Ancient magical beasts such as dragons are suffused with the very essence of magic itself: the raw magical chaos that is the Prime Discordant. It is every part of their being, unlike us mortals who must awaken ourselves to soar as they do so naturally. Using this power is unimaginably dangerous, which is why we must ensure we develop a suitably powerful scepter before we attempt to harness it lest we be destroyed by pure Discordance."

Artificery and mechanical intrusions are a blight upon this world, allowing the mundane to harness technology, and worse, magic, without having taken the Ascendant Path.

Adventurers have a sense to do good, but also the sense to gain power, titles and gold on the way - so why not use that to our advantage? Restructuring the adventurers and folding them into the state apparatus will do us well: let them be the chosen and favoured agents to do our dark bidding within the Demesne and beyond.

 Z99_end_ettalindes_line_desc:0 "In ages past Ettalinde the Wretched, one of Nichmer the Sorcerer-King's acolytes, made a dark deal with Aldresian crusaders who were jealous of the longetivity of elven life - and thus, vampires were born. Their ancient hierarchies and traditions predate ours, and they have no doubt kept an eye on our affairs and seek to destroy us from their crypts and lairs, worse, they too undoubtedly hold some of the most powerful sorcerers unknown to man - capable of challenging our own Acolytes and perhaps even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. Now that we control their nominal domains of Corvuria, they are now at our mercy, and we must root those who resist from the shadows with mageflame. Those who wish to live, must serve."

In ages past, it was Castonath that held itself as the city of cities. It was Castonath that was at the center of the known world. And it must become so again. The universe is bound to primal, magical chaos, and Anbenncóst for all its faults is a perfect example of that... but nonetheless, primal chaos must be accepted and intuited and primal chaos must be controlled and forged by a willful user. Castonath is an example of that. An example of will. An example of perseverance through chaos. Castonath is a city of all time, a city of stone.

 Z99_elven_resort_desc:0 "Oh, how the Lady Ioriel masterminded her way into the power behind the throne of Lorent. It is something that only Acolytes could dream of! With her machinations came the beautiful forests of the Redglades. For a long time the elves have held this forest sanctuary for their own accords, living out peacefully and largely ignoring the rest of the world. Perhaps it can do the same for us - it is a perfect site to reward loyal initiates with the pleasures of the world, far away from real power."
 Z99_a_noble_delicacy_title:0 "A Noble Delicacy"
 Z99_a_noble_delicacy_desc:0 "The Bay of Wines. A fruitful region known for its excess. But it is in that excess that a mind can be truly liberated to accept that Prime Discordance for what it is... and let it be."
 Z99_freeing_the_body_title:0 "Freeing the Body"
 Z99_freeing_the_body_desc:0 "The material world is but an illusion, shackles and chains for the mind, for in the end there is only the Prime Discordance of universal chaos. The kobolds may not be capable of developing a well-disciplined intuition, but we can shatter their material chains — and perhaps gain even more precious damestear in the process."
 Z99_renaissance_title:0 "The Dark Renaissance"
 Z99_renaissance_desc:0 "The Black Demesne's core philosophy is the primacy of magic in all things. With our ascendancy, the time has come to apply this to art and architecture and consign the pathetic 'art' of the mundane world to the dustbin of history."

 Z99_inner_consolidation_title:0 "Inner Consolidation"

 Z99_absolute_power_title:0 "Absolute Power"
 Z99_absolute_power_desc:0 "The Ascendant Dragon watches all from its station above the world, reshaping and rebuilding all things at a whim. The power of the Skull Throne does not wane, and those who lie in wait will be consumed by darkness."
 Z99_corrupt_absolutly_title:0 "Corrupts Absolutely"
 Z99_corrupt_absolutly_desc:0 "The tragic weakness of our neighbors begets chaos and uncertainty. The reach of the Skull Throne must extend far beyond our borders to deal with the imperfection of the world."
 Z99_bringer_of_order_title:0 "Bringer Of Order"
 Z99_bringer_of_order_desc:0 "Life outside the Demesne is nasty, poor, brutish, and short. Through the cultivation of intuition, we have brought into being the purest harmonies of all history.

 Z99_in_thy_name_title:0 "In Thy Name"
 Z99_in_thy_name_desc:0 "All lay tribute at the feet of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Ascending Dragon of the Skull Throne. A great festival has been called to honor the Demesne's innumerable contributions to the lives of its people."
 Z99_to_his_chosen_few_title:0 "The Chosen Few"
 Z99_to_his_chosen_few_desc:0 "Previous magical monarchs have been overwhelmed and consumed by narcissism and paranoia, ended by their need to control all - but that is not the way of primal magical chaos, it is not the way of the Prime Discordance. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] follows in the footsteps of Nichmer, the first Sorcerer-King, who came to the conclusion that, to avoid this fate, power, knowledge, and responsibility must be shared with a chosen group of mages known as the Acolytes, who will bear his word in their respective domains."
 Z99_the_blakpurgis_title:0 "The Blackpurgis"
 Z99_the_blakpurgis_desc:0 "The great magical tournament known as the Blackpurgis is surely a spectacle unlike any other in the world, but few deign to even be nearby as it unfolds, the Acolytes and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] competing to demonstrate their mystical prowess with little concern for the welfare of those nearby or even the local stability of reality. The winner is the mightiest mage of all, and thus at the eye of the storm that is the Prime Discordance."
 Z99_west_deepwoods_title:0 "Into the Deepwoods"
 Z99_west_deepwoods_desc:0 "The Deepwoods are a fantastically interesting place, one of the largest-scale interactions of the mystical with mundane nature thanks to the many alien machinations of the Fey.

 Z99_scepter_industry_title:0 "Scepter Industry"
 Z99_scepter_industry_desc:0 "With the growing number of initiates and mages, there has been a level of demand for scepters never before seen on Cannor.

 Z99_the_eyes_and_the_ears_desc:0 "Tellum and Nathalaire shall be two great cities at the heart of our information network, the beating heart of the nation's mind. However, before they can support such efforts, the Skull Throne will have to make considerable investments in the local infrastructure."
 Z99_operation_overseer_title:0 "Operation Overseer"
 Z99_operation_overseer_desc:0 "Operation Overseer is a planned invasion of Sarhal, proposed to the Acolytes and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by one of the Demesne's top generals.

 Z99_the_khet_shores_title:0 "The Khetist Shores"
 Z99_the_khet_shores_desc:0 "Kheterata still stands outside our influence, and with such a symbol of historical endurance standing in defiance of the Mystic Revolution, there will always be doubts about our new order. It is time to establish the Demesne's base of operations on their shores."
 Z99_stabilizing_our_grip_title:0 "Stabilizing Our Grip"
 Z99_stabilizing_our_grip_desc:0 "Control of North Sarhal is tenuous as long as we remain distantly removed overlords. A project of deliberately settling loyal subjects will be key to fully integrating these lands into the Demesne."
 Z99_claiming_the_mandate_title:0 "Claiming The Mandate"
 Z99_claiming_the_mandate_desc:0 "The Khet are a prime example of a demiurge made flesh. Their very presence is an affront to the Black Demesne, and must be dealt with permanently... once the Sarhal Expansion happens (in a long time). TBD."
 Z99_dwarf_fortress_title:0 "A Dwarf Fortress"
 Z99_dwarf_fortress_desc:0 "The dwarves are a race obsessed with the mundane and material. With our guidance, however, they may yet turn out to live productive lives in the service of magic.

 Z99_fate_of_the_ancients_title:0 "Fate Of The Ancients"
 Z99_fate_of_the_ancients_desc:0 "The elves and dwarves are ancient races, a symbol of the old order itself. Their existence complicates our project of making the world anew and liberating mortals from the lies that keep them in chains when these long-lived fools live for the past.

 Z99_unveiling_the_shroud_title:0 "Piercing the Veil"
 Z99_unveiling_the_shroud_desc:0 "The conquest of the Deepwoods must be undertaken with great care.

 Z99_a_timber_need_desc:0 "The wood of the demiurges' mundane world is next to worthless for our needs. Only the mystic trees of the Deepwoods can satisfy the growing need for magical timber in the Demesne."
 Z99_the_verdant_link_title:0 "The Verdant Link"
 Z99_the_verdant_link_desc:0 "The Verdant Link is one of the most fascinating instances of a permanent, large-scale magical system. It is said that it dips in and out of the plane of the Fey, and that traveling through it can lead you to anywhere in the Deepwoods itself. Conquest will be necessary to effectuate full-time study of its peculiar morphology."
 Z99_the_verdant_secret_title:0 "The Verdant Secret"
 Z99_the_verdant_secret_desc:0 "The secrets of the Verdant Link are near to our grasp. With the greatest minds ever to walk the world sharpening themselves on the problem, it is only a matter of time before this particular piece of obscura bends to the shining light of knowledge."

 Z99_operation_sunset_title:0 "Operation Sunset"
 Z99_operation_sunset_desc:0 "The Skull Throne cannot countenance any challenge to its primacy.

 Z99_the_first_acolyte_desc:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has kept a coterie of loyal initiates and has taught them the hidden and obscure secrets of ancient times, of the fundamental Prime Discordance, the magical chaos that dictates all and nothing.

 Z99_the_second_acolyte_title:0 "The Second Acolyte"
 Z99_the_second_acolyte_desc:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] shall correct the mistakes of those who came before — the great work to be done cannot be compromised by hubris, narcissism, or selfishness.

 Z99_wardens_of_the_state_title:0 "Wardens of the State"
 Z99_wardens_of_the_state_desc:0 "The parentless creatures of the realm shall be placed under the benevolent care of the Skull Throne.

 Z99_the_dames_tear_desc:0 "Damestear has been widely known for its magical properties for some time, and indeed it is absolutely crucial for any major working of arcana.
