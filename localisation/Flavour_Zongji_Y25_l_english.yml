 Y25_still_the_winds_title: "Still The Winds"
 Y25_still_the_winds_desc: "The Shuimu League, led by Feiten, is a somewhat newer phenomenon in yanshen when compared to our long reign here. However, This upstart confederation of city states has been growing ever aggresive and expansionist. In the Kingdom of Xiyun, they have recently incited a rebellion. With the backing of the league, the rebels were victorious and have broken away, underneath the authority of the City of Luoyip. The league likely plans on taking the entire kingdom for themselves if they are not put in their place."
 Y25_middle_castes_mission_1_title: "Budding Middle Castes"
 Y25_middle_castes_mission_1_desc: "Owning a port opens up many enticing opportunities for trade and advancing the restoration of our great empire.This was not always the case, however. In the past, there have not been many cities along the coast of Yanshen. Coastal trade was not very profitable or enticing for merchants, leading to small and sparse settlement. For the most part, trade within Yanshen was almost completely either up or down the Yanhe, making the cities that lay along it very wealthy, with Tianlou becoming the largest and wealthiest, as one of the only cities on the coast. However, in the aftermath of Jaher's Campaigns, many refugees fled to the coast and cities began sprouting up. These cities began facilitating trade, and later banded together and formed the Shuimu League, which we recently dealt with. With their power diminished, a vaccum has opened up in coastal trade, and we should take advantage of this."
 Y25_invest_in_the_temples_title: "Invest in the Temples"
 Y25_invest_in_the_temples_desc: "The importance in the upkeep and maintenance of the great High Temples cannot be overstated, but the roads leading to them, and the villages that have cropped up near the temples are just as deserving of care. they should all be outfitted with appropriate amenities for visitng adherents, as well as debate halls and centers of discussion for travelling scholars."
 Y25_order_of_the_meticulous_eye_title: "The Meticulous Eye"
 Y25_order_of_the_meticulous_eye_desc: "The High Temples are great sources of inspiration and knowledge for all students of the High Philosophy. Endless amounts of wisdom and guidance and philosophical principles have been imparted on us by scholars of the temples; however, to this day, noone is quite sure what purpose the high temples served. What was their purpose? How did they function in order to serve that purpose? The high gods were wise enough to achieve enlightenment, so surely these structures served some grand purpose. That is what we seek to discover. To that end, we will found a new order of scholars, the brightest minds in yanshen, dedicated to researching the temples."
 Y25_the_heavenly_towers_title: "The Heavenly Towers"
 Y25_the_heavenly_towers_desc: "Tianlou; the most important city in the histories of both high philosophy itself, and our dynasty. It was here Harimar conquered to, it was here that he ruled, and it is here that the greatest complex of high temples in all of haless lies. It is here in the heavenly towers that harimar vanished. With the order of scholars founded, their first task is the studious investigation of the high temples. for over a millenia, the many students of the high philosphy have venerated the high temples, with the goal of attaining enlightenment. But very few have studied what it was exactly that the temples did. What is their function? what was their function back in the days when the high gods were still bound to this lower existence? our great philosphers and scholars will be thinking hard, and studying carefuly, and respectfuly."
 
 Y25_an_exercise_in_diplomacy_title: "An Excercise in Diplomacy"
 Y25_an_exercise_in_diplomacy_desc: "One of the most important traits in a Liangzhu is the ability to negotiate and navigate complicated situations with ease. A silver tongue with the ability to ease tension and come to reasonable agreements that are fair to all parties. Our current heir demonstrated these qualities in their examinations and is a very promising candidate for Liangzhu. In order to even better prepare them for the exceedingly important task of ruling, we should let them gain experience firsthand; We shall utilize their skills by sending them on diplomatic missions to nearby nations, a true testament to their skill, and hopefuly a sign of great things to come."
 Y25_stern_diplomacy_title: "Stern Diplomacy"
 Y25_stern_diplomacy_desc: "Strength of will, assertiveness, steadfastness; these are qualities sometimes underlooked in diplomats, but if one is to be truly just and fair, one must not back down in negotiations. We know our worth, and we know what is just and what is fair. Our diplomats will not only embody the common qualities of persuasiveness, compassion, and kindness, but must also be stern and unwavering in their integrity."
 Y25_tea_time_title: "Tea Time"
 Y25_tea_time_desc: "Tea is constantly in demand as a fixture of Righteous Path religious rituals, and additionally is popular as a recreational drink. It isn't possible to have too much of it available to sell. Expanding the plantations of tea leaves will let us export more tea, which will mean both more profits and a chance at better relations with our buyers."
 Y25_honeyed_words_title: "Honeyed Words"
 Y25_honeyed_words_desc: "We have begun to prove ourselves to the people of yanshen; we have been strong, willful, and stern. We have made it clear that we are not to be messed with. It was neccesary to use shows of force and might to get this far, but that is not how we wish to be viewed; we are not conquerers, we are not bullies, and we are not tyrants. Now that yanshen knows to respect us, we need not forcefuly subjugate them; by being steadfast allies, great friends, trustworthy confidants, and benevolent rulers, the people of Yanshen will willingly swear fealty to us. We must still remain strong, and assertive, and willful, but these are traits that others will look up to us for, and not resent us for. Soon enough, the eunuchs will be bowing before us in the great capital of Tianlou once more."
 Y25_palace_of_the_divine_call_title: "Palace of the Divine Call"
 Y25_palace_of_the_divine_call_desc: "By any regard it seems that Harimar wanted the center of his empire (or at least one of them) to be in Tianlou, for it is said that he took one look at the city and fell in love with it. The city already has some pre-existing infrastructure, most particularly the decrepit Palace of the Divine Call. Renovating it will be expensive, but it will create a place of residence for our family, in addition to a new center where the highest levels of government can be overseen."
 Y25_order_of_the_divine_call_title: "Order of the Divine Call"
 Y25_order_of_the_divine_call_desc: "The diplomatic corps has been working hard, but as it currently stands there is not enough infrastructure to separate the best of the career from the worst. To that end, there needs to be a new organ of state for the absolute best diplomats, the individuals with the initiative and skill to shift the balance all across Yanshen. The Order of the Divine Call - a cadre for only the greatest."
 
 Y25_an_exercise_in_ambition_title: "An Excercise in Ambition"
 Y25_an_exercise_in_ambition_desc: "One of the most important traits in a Liangzhu is ambition. One must always seek to become stronger, faster, smarter, better in some way. The Lianzghu must seek the betterment of not only himself but of the realm, and the people beneath it. The Liangzhu must have a clear, resolute vision for the future, a vision guided by the strict moral codes infused in them, that they will stop at nearly nothing to achieve. The future of Yanshen itself is ripe for the taking, and the Liangzhu will use their skills to make sure that it is THEIR vision that becomes reality."
 Y25_demand_respect_title: "Demand Respect"
 Y25_demand_respect_desc: "It is no secret that we have not been taken seriously for quite some time. We have been percieved as a joke to the population of Yanshen for nearly a milenia. this injustice has gone on for far too long. if people are to take us seriously again, we need to prove to them that we are not a force to be messed with, and not as much of a joke as we have come to be seen as. We need to show them all the power of Zongji and demand the respect that we are due."
 Y25_recognition_title: "Recognition"
 Y25_recognition_desc: "We have begun to prove ourselves to the people of yanshen; we have been strong, willful, and stern. We have made it clear that we are not to be messed with. It was neccesary to use shows of force and might to get this far, but that is not how we wish to be viewed; we are not conquerers, we are not bullies, and we are not tyrants. Now that yanshen knows to respect us, we need not forcefuly subjugate them; by being steadfast allies, great friends, trustworthy confidants, and benevolent rulers, the people of Yanshen will willingly swear fealty to us. We must still remain strong, and assertive, and willful, but these are traits that others will look up to us for, and not resent us for. Soon enough, the eunuchs will be bowing before us in the great capital of Tianlou once more."
 Y25_the_auspicious_daughter_title: "Auspicious Daughter"
 Y25_the_auspicious_daughter_desc: "While Tianlou is the largest and most important city in all of Haless, its daughter city of Sziagnu is going to be just as vital to our rule of Yanshen. Its position along the Yanhe means it has simple access to nearly all of Yanshen, and we eventually may want to distance some of our officials from the intrigue of Tianlou, where unsavory sorts may try influencing government affairs. We should invest in the city so it can fulfill the role of secondary capital in the future, and our first step is to invest in some important infrastructure for the city. Our architects have already begun drafting plans for a grand public square bringing glory to the house of the Divine Call. However, this public square is just the first of many projects currently planned by our architects, not just for Sziagnu, but for all of Yanshen."
 Y25_masters_of_tianlou_title: "Masters of Tianlou"
 Y25_masters_of_tianlou_desc: "Tianlou lies at the mouth of the smoky river. It is the jewel of the yanhe, the heart, the brain of yanshen, and the most important city in all of haless. With Tianlou in our control, we have real authority. for the first time in over a milleniia. The rest of yanshen shall bow before their rightful rulers, and submit to the true emperors of Yanshen. Our benevolent Liangzhu has been gracious towards its subjects, and they bow willingly out of respect for our rule; we had once lost their respect, but now that we have proven ourselves, they willingly return to our embrace. If they do not bow willingly, then they will be forced to. They will bow, and proclaim as a message for all their brethren to hear; The Emperors of Yanshen have returned."
 Y25_spreading_our_influence_title: "Control the North"
 Y25_spreading_our_influence_desc: "In the times before Harimar, Yanshen was ruled by many squabbling rival kingdoms. The Yanhe formed the lifeblood of the kingdom of Zizhou, formed in defiance of the northern kingdom of Jiyuan. Both built fortresses all over the land to defend against the other, but neither could withstand the might of harimar, who crushed both kingdoms and erased them off the map; not even their crowns and titles remained to be claimed, destroyed by harimar and handed over to his new class of eunuch administrators. Northern Yanshen is a much more wild wartorn land in comparison to the rest of the region, even dating back to the time of Lianzhou this has been the case. The Jiangyang peoples are hardened by warfare and lives on the frontier of yanshen. Exerting our influence over these peoples brings great benefits to the state, sellswords and mercenaries willing to assist our armies for a price. As we begin to apply the caste system to the lands we conquer, many of these hardened soldiers begin vying for a position in our upper caste as warriors."
 Y25_middle_castes_mission_2_title: "Prospering Middle Caste"
 Y25_middle_castes_mission_2_desc: "The implimentation of the Yan caste system has been going smoothly for the most part. However, we have found ourselves in a situation where the lower and upper castes are much more powerful and influential than the middle castes. Despite being one of the oldest states in Yanshen, we have been an extremely minor player in the trade scene. For the longest time we have controlled land on neither the Yanhe nor the coast, and our mercantile traditions suffered for it. This means that while we hold control over quite a large portion of Yanshen, it is not our merchants driving the trade, it is the merchants of our vassals. If we were to tighten our grip on Yanshen tommorow, there is no existing infrastructure in our government to handle the administration of trade in an empire so large. We would grow completely and entirely reliant on local administration to handle the problems. while relying on local administration to solve certain problems is something that is neccesary to the management of an empire this large, we must try to avoid doing it to such a large degree. It was this folly that led to the downfall of Lianzhou in the first place. Out of concern for the health of the caste system, and the future of our empire, we must establish our own mercantile traditions and offices."
 Y25_eunuch_integration_decree_title: "Decree of Integration"
 Y25_eunuch_integration_decree_desc: "Upon conquering Yanshen, the great and wise Harimar of the Divine Call uprooted the entrenched kingdoms and nobility in the region. He devised and implimented the system of eunuch governance and administration utilized throughout Yanshen to this day. It is of great importance to his legacy that we respect his wishes and his vision, but we have hit the issue of how exactly the system of euncuh administration is going to work alongside the proposed Yan Caste System. However, this is not actually as large of an issue as it seems. Rahen's caste system is entrenched in millenia of tradition, and changes to it are nigh impossible to achieve without great upheaval. Our system has only just begun, and we have all the freedom in the world to adapt it to our needs and our vision. We are in a unique position here, in which we can create the exact system we desire, without resistance and without restraint. Thus, the question of how eunuchs can possibly fit into the caste system is solved; simply because we have designed it so, any who undergo the procedure, receive training from an acreddited eunuch academy, and enter into the service of our administration are considered part of the upper caste, with all of the benefits that come with it. Those who enter particularly high positions will be compensated particularly well, with family members able to join them in status and receive free training for any career in the upper caste that they wish. "
 
 Y25_an_exercise_in_understanding_title: "An Excercise in Compassion"
 Y25_an_exercise_in_understanding_desc: "All around us, there are people with differing religions and views and philosophies and ways of thinking; but this is not neccesarily a bad thing. One of the most important traits in a Liangzhu is to be understanding of differences, and to seek out common ground where it can be found. An understanding and empathetic Liangzhu comes to be percieved by others not only as strong and wise, but as benevolent and friendly. We should be sure to invite a scholar from another school of high philosophy to our nation for friendly debate and discussion."
 Y25_crush_the_rebellion_title: "Crush the Rebellion"
 Y25_crush_the_rebellion_desc: "The city of Lanjinhui is in a state of active rebellion, having split away from the warlords of Jiangdu over their chronic mistreatment. Such a reaction is understandable, if not justifiable. The peasants do not know what they want - in reality, what they desire is stability and a wise, yet firm, hand. When one is provided, they will return to their productive selves."
 Y25_city_of_warlords_title: "City of Warlords"
 Y25_city_of_warlords_desc: "For all their hubris, the "Yellow Dragons" of Jiangdu have forged their nation into a disciplined and competent militant city-state. Though it has lost much of its former domain, the "City of Warlords" is still home to a formidable human officer class containing many experienced captains and shrewd tacticians whose skill our Harimari generals must grudgingly acknowledge. His Majesty's cause would do well to incorporate them into His armies - a Righteous Will and Valiant Heart can be augmented with discipline and strategy into a force to shake the whole of the continent."
 Y25_up_the_yan_title: "Up the Yanhe"
 Y25_up_the_yan_desc: "A body ceases to function without the blood flowing through it, as the hunters of the Harimari well known. We hold some of the body of Yanshen, but our greater prize must ultimately be blood, the river Yanhe. As it flows through the region, it gathers up trade and knowledge in it's course and the great cities along its waters collect the sediment to become ever grander. All conquerors and emperors of Yanshen made their power surge down this river, and all along the banks the people have felt it. Compared to the Yanhe, all other waters are but creeks, and all other land is dry and fruitless. We must take the Yanhe."
 Y25_brethren_in_yanzhin_title: "Brethren in Yanzhin"
 Y25_brethren_in_yanzhin_desc: "The current state of disarray in Yanshen can be attributed to many causes - scheming by duplicitous eunuchs and mayors, the depradations of the terror riders, old wounds from the Phoenix elves. However, what troubles the august rulers of Zongji most is disunity amongst the Childrens of Harimar. To the great shame of the Divine Call, at times Harimar claw even sheds Harimar blood. This must be brought to an end, and our brothers of the Undying Flame and Withering Wind made to see that we once against possess the Divine Will to unite all Yanshen."
 Y25_conditional_obedience_title: "Conditional Obedience"
 Y25_conditional_obedience_desc: "The Withering Wind Harimari, stewards of the western fortress of Hubao, have long held the monstrous Oni of the Demon Hills at bay. Cut off from the Lower Yan for centuries, it is only by heroic effort and tremendous sacrifice that the fortress stood for so long. Understandably, they are wary of simply throwing open the gates and allowing the Divine Call to garrison these lands again, though our claim is rightful and our armies once again strong. With honeyed tongue or bloody claw, we must once again open the road to Hubao and begin to repair and fortify our ancient frontier against the demons."
 
 Y25_laying_the_groundwork_title: "Laying the Groundwork"
 Y25_laying_the_groundwork_desc: "When Harimar of the Divine Call disappeared, his empire eventually split. We are the descendants of the great eastern half of his empire, known as Lianzhou. We held dominion over Yanshen for many centuries, but endured a diappointing and regretable decline due to mismanagement. The other half of Harimar's empire, the Harimraj, not only maintained its authority and rule for 4 centuries longer than we did but also underwent a resurgence with the founding of the 2nd Harimraj in the year 1312, which saw it once more solidly in control of Rahen. Many of our Liangzhu have pondered why the Harimraj saw so much more success than we did, and in the year 1131, 181 years before the founding of the 2nd Harimraj, Yatasuo of the Divine Call left for Rahen and returned with his answer. Even in its shattered state, the warlords of Rahen were powerful and demanded respect. Strict adherence to the caste system allowed the rulers much greater control over their subjects than otherwise, ensuring much greater stability in the realm. And so our plan was formalized establish control over Yanshen via the implimentation of the Raheni Caste System. However, we cannot simply expect to enforce this without major pushback; for this reason, we need to take certain precautions and compromises to ensure revolts do not happen and that unrest remains low."
 Y25_expand_families_title: "Expand the Families"
 Y25_expand_families_desc: "Our warriors have done well thus far at asserting our will and restoring some respect to our dynasty. The Jiazu in particular have played a great role in this feat, and shall be awarded for their efforts and honor. Each family shall receive a small but elegant estate in the picturesque Mulim woods. However, as we continue to assert ourselves upon Yanshen, we will find that these great warrior families, while they have served us immeasurably since their formation during the rise of the Caste System here, will not be enough to support our goals. As such, we need to establish more families as upper caste warriors, harimari and human alike, to bring glory to our empire. While making changes in caste such as these would be difficult and unheard of in certain parts of Rahen, our system is still in its formative years, malleable to our will. The changes can be arranged. If these new families bring us glory and respect as well, they too shall be rewarded in kind."
 Y25_the_golden_highway_title: "The Golden Highway"
 Y25_the_golden_highway_desc: "Though the conquering Sun Elves dealt us terrible wounds and did many great wrongs in Yanshen, their Phoenix Emperor Jaher was correct that ruling over a vast empire and willfull populace required the ability to move goods and armies at a pace that dirt roads and river barges cannot supply. A Divine Road can be rebuilt on the ruins of their old Golden Highway, stretching across all of Yanshen and beyond!"
 Y25_monuments_of_greatness_title: "Monuments to our Greatness"
 Y25_monuments_of_greatness_desc: "Despite the growing size and complexity of our state apparatus, the only interaction that many citizens have with the paws of the state is in the form of His Majesty's tax collectors. Diverting some of these gains into the construction of massive market squares, public forums for philosophers to gather, and memorials to the righteous fallen will remind our populace of the power, wealth, and benevolence of the Rightful Rulers of Yanshen."
 Y25_the_prosperous_heartlands_title: "The Prosperous Heartlands"
 Y25_the_prosperous_heartlands_desc: "From the beating heartlands surrounding our capital flows the blood of Empire - tax revenue for the coffers, goods for industry, and soldiers for our distant wars. Keeping these lands productive, warding off the depravations of war and famine, and letting these citizens reap the benefits of our military and diplomatic success are all necessary to press onward to our glorious destiny."

 flavour_zongji.1.d: "The Finding of the Liangzhu has passed, all the eligible scions of the Clan $DYNASTY$ have presented themselves and been examined by our greatest scholars and wisest elders. But whom has passed the exams with the greatest score? The papers have been laid out before us. Nowe we must decide."

 flavour_zongji.1.dd: "Wisdom is a trait most desirable in a ruler."
 
 flavour_zongji.2.t: "City of Warlords"
 flavour_zongji.2.d: "The city of Jiangdu now submits to us. Many among our upper caste find the climate more suitable for their tastes; Warriors patrol the streets and train and perform drills in their garrisons, while our administrators fill new posts opened up related to governing the relations between the city and our state. For the most part, we have let most administrators keep their positions, and in a gesture of good will, we are letting the city retain its stratocratic systems. However, in our dealings with the city, the topic has come up of a special arrangement being reached. Most forms of the proposal entail an exchange. We are to retake all of the lands that Jiangdu lost during the course of the Blue Scarves rebellion, and transfer control of the area to their governance. In exchange, Jiangdu will help us achieve this goal in the best way they can; by offering us some of their brightest military minds to the cause. We are under no obligation to pursue this arrangement, and these ideas could simply die out over time, but if we wished, entering into this arrangemet and keeping our promises would assuredly make the administrators of Jiangdu very loyal and supportive of all of our endeavors in the future."

Now that we have reconquered the area, it is time for us to fulfill our end of the bargain. Of course, we could alter the deal, but this would upset relations with them greatly."

 flavour_zongji.6.a: "Excellent."

 flavour_zongji.7.t: "Undying Flame"
 flavour_zongji.7.d: "We have finally, after a long and arduous millenium, found ourselves back in control of Jiantsiang. It was first established by us in 98 AA as a garrison on the northern frontier of our empire, to bravely protect Yanshen from bandits and to stop Shuvuush incrusions from reaching deeper into the region. As our empire began collapsing, we eventually lost control over the region.\n\nYet over 1000 years after our empire collapsed, Jiantsiang has survived, and at times, thrived. Their great brazier, the Undying Flame, still burns as red as Tigersblood Rubies, and it is a true testament to the strength and tenacity of harimari all over Yanshen that it does so. Under our rule, we will ensure that the brazier continues to burn, and that northern Yanshen will continue to be safe and sound.\n\nThe valiant warriors of Jiantsiang happen to fall within the upper castes in our new order, and for their service, they will be granted estates, and solidified as some of the most prestigious warrior families in Yanshen.\nThe shrewd merchants of Jiantsiang, gemcarvers and merchants, in the lucrative ruby trade, will be a part of the middle castes, with easy access to our whole empire, a grand expansion on the trade of these blood red rubies.\nAnd you cannot forget the Harimari in the fields of the frontier, providing food for the garrison and risking their lives living near the Shuvuush border, or the harimari in the mines extracting the rubies for refinement. They will fit into the lower castes, their endurance and strength invaluable to our order, and our vision."
 flavour_zongji.7.a: "All will fit into our vision."

 flavour_zongji.8.t: "The Winds of Change"
 flavour_zongji.8.d: "The Second Harimraj has fallen. The news, while not entirely unsurprising given recent events, has shaken the landscape of the continent to its core. The news hits especially hard for the upper castes here in Zongji. In addition to the more local Yan philosphies, over the past few centuries, the great minds of our nation became increasingly intrigued by Raheni philosophies and thought. The rebirth of the Harimraj gave many of the scions of our dynasty hope that they could acomplish something on the same scale in Yanshen. The great minds of our nation, our Liangzhu among them, have been slowly processing their emotions and thoughts. Many have come to the conclusion that any atempt to restore Harimar's Empire is a fool's errand, and that every atempt is destined to fail. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been feeling less confident in their convictions. Is our plan truly destined to fail? No. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to their own conclusion. The main factor that led to the fall of the Second Harimraj is the same thing that led to the fall of Lianzhou; weak, incompetent emperors. This is something we find ourselves uniquely prepared to face. As long as we continue the Liangzhu examinations, no weak or incompetent emperor will ever sit upon the Tiger Throne. Our people will not become demoralized by the news. In fact, this has only served to prove a point; We are perhaps the ONLY ones who can truly restore Harimar's Empire."
 flavour_zongji.8.a: "And so it shall be done."
