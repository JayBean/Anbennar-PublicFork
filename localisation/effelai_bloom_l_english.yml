    effelai_bloom.3.d:0 "Many of the expeditions into Effelai did not return, and more yet had suffered severe casualties. The information that they were able to bring back with them, however, is immensely valuable. The pulsing mass below the trees was found to be present throughout our territory in the Effelai jungle, forming a vast network. Presumably, it even spreads far beyond our own territory. What is more, it is undeniably and indisputably alive and sentient. All of our expeditions report the same thing: Any form of attacks made against them, be it by Seedthralls, the strange monstrosities that dwell in the jungle, or the trees themselves, all coincided with the network below their feet pulsing heavily. Many have started referring to the thing as Effelai, as they believe that there is no difference between this pulsing network, the jungle itself, and even many of the creatures that live within it. The Effelai, they claim, is a single creature, covering nearly half the continent of Southern Aelantir. And it wants us dead.\n\nThese discoveries have stirred much unrest in the court, and our advisors are deeply split over what the next course of action should be. Most are in agreement that we are, whether we like it or not, are at war with this creature. And in order to win this war, we must cleanse the jungle with fire and steel, and destroy Effelai, root and stem. Either Effelai lives here, or we do. A smaller group of advisors, however, see a different path. The natives of Effelai were able to live alongside it for centuries in relative peace. What is more, we have capabilities that they did not have. If Effelai is indeed intelligent enough to conduct warfare, they argue, it must be intelligent enough to communicate and reason with. If we can make peace with Effelai, and live alongside it, we can form an alliance of a kind that we have never made before. We can plainly see what damage Effelai can do to us; imagine what it could do to our enemies."

    effelai_bloom.4.d:0 "There are strange reports coming in from our lands in the Effelai, as the entirety of the jungle appears to be in upheaval. Locals report many strange events, from haunting songs and strange gases emanating from the jungle to entire copses of trees moving by themselves. But the strangest thing of all is the color. The entire jungle, even including plants that should not carry flowers, has started to bloom. Under the dark green canopy of the Effelai rainforest there is an explosion of color, as flowers cover nearly every surface. They range from the brightest red and deepest blue to reflective silver and gold, or even a shimmering iridescence of colors like light broken in oil. Some mages theorize that there is some powerful spell or curse affecting the region, perhaps dating back to the Day of Ashen Skies. Meanwhile, many of the ruinborn elves native to the Effelai are convinced that their goddess has awoken, angry at the influx of outsiders who do not respect the sanctity of her jungle or appease her with sacrifices and songs. Whatever the case may be, we need to find out what is going on and how to put a stop to it before things get out of hand."

    effelai_bloom.301.d:0 "The ritualistic songs that the ruinborn native to the Effelai sing to calm the jungle have generally been believed to be simple superstition. The recent discoveries as to the nature of the Effelai, however, have caused some to call this belief into question. Many adventuring bards have ventured out to sing at exposed parts of the Effelai network, with promising results. Although there is certainly nothing even close to communication, the network undeniably reacts to the songs, pulsing smoothly along with the resonance of the music. Adventurers are now petitioning for an organized effort to seek out the many disparate tribes of the Effelai, and compile their combined knowledge of ritualistic songs for more experimentation."

    effelai_bloom.308.d:0 "The Effelai Bloom has been a great shock to the native ruinborn tribes. To them, it is the wrath of their goddess, known to most of them as Tswohvwoh'íi, the personification of the jungle. As the tribes with very few exceptions had lived very closely intertwined with the jungle, the Effelai Bloom has hit them especially hard, decimating many of their communities.Their ritualistic songs have almost entirely fallen out of use since the Bloom started, as Tswohvwoh'íi would not be calmed by them any longer. They view us with suspicion, as they consider us outsiders part of the reason that all of this has happened. And every single time, as a tribe is approached by our adventurers and legates, they are apprehensive and mistrustful. But every single time, when they are asked for aid to help calm the Effelai, they relent, and agree. We have now gathered a large number of these jungle singers, and their songs are being put on paper for all to learn."

    effelai_bloom.310.t:0 "Effelai Bloom: Mages Attempt Contact"
    effelai_bloom.310.d:0 "A great many mages have been very eager to try their hand at establishing communication with Effelai, and have quickly gotten to work. In many disparate attempts, some by single mages, some by large groups, mages have attempted in a multitude of ways to interact with the Effelai network. So far, however, their attempts have yielded no tangible results. Far from being dissagued, however, it has solidified their resolve, as ‘solving the Effelai problem' becomes a prestige project that every mage wants to be the one to figure out."
    effelai_bloom.310.a:0 "We keep trying."
    effelai_bloom.311.t:0 "Effelai Bloom: A Base of Operations"
    effelai_bloom.311.d:0 "Now that we have a potential way to interact with the Effelai network, we need a secure place to conduct our field research. Previous attempts have often been under threat from Effelai incursions, and if our operation were to come under attack after we have centralized our efforts, it could jeopardize all of our progress. Because of this, we are establishing a small base of operations, guarded and fortified to the best of our abilities against the worst that Effelai can throw at us. The very act of doing so, however, provokes yet more aggression from Effelai, turning it into an effort that has to be continuously adapted, repaired, and improved, in order to maintain conditions as stable as possible for research."
    effelai_bloom.311.a:0 "Good."
    effelai_bloom.311.b:0 "The artificers should help, too."
    effelai_bloom.312.t:0 "Mages Study the Effela"
    effelai_bloom.312.d:0 "It is obvious that there is an enormous amount of magic involved in the Effelai Bloom, but it is channeled into a form that we have not seen before. A group of mages is eager to aid in our efforts to understand it, but they believe the key to their work lies beyond our borders. The great network below the jungle appears to be the conduit for the propagation of this magic, and these mages want to study a place where the roots of this network converge. They have heard about the location of one of these so-called "hubs", and are now petitioning us to claim this region for ourselves so that we can conduct our research."
    effelai_bloom.312.a:0 "The jungle's secrets will be ours soon."
    effelai_bloom.313.t:0 "Mages Irritate The Effelai"
    effelai_bloom.313.d:0 "Although magic is taught, it has always been more of an art than a science, and when faced with the unknown mages will often throw caution to the wind. In their attempts to study the roots of the Effelai, our mages have been infusing them with spells, amazed at the sheer volume of magic they are able to contain inside. It appears that magic has now been released, as several regions around the roots have been devastated in what appears to have been a massive surge of rampant magic, severe backlash from their reckless experiments."
    effelai_bloom.313.a:0 "They ought to have been more careful…"
    effelai_bloom.314.t:0 "Seedthralls Attack"
    effelai_bloom.314.d:0 "As our mages are intensifying their research on the neural network of the Effelai, they notice it starts pulsating in a rhythmic fashion, emitting a melodic sound that almost seems to mimic human song. They eagerly start to note down their observations, oblivious to the danger they were in. And suddenly, they were surrounded. Seedthralls, emerging from the depths of the jungle, attack every living soul in sight, answering the call of the network and coming to its defense."
    effelai_bloom.314.a:0 "Mindless, but so coordinated…"
    effelai_bloom.315.t:0 "Effelai Wildlife Attack"
    effelai_bloom.315.d:0 "After the neural network seemed to hold quiet for a while, our scouts suddenly report strange movements of wild animals at the edge of the jungle. And then, before we have a chance to prepare, they attack. Moving as if a disciplined army, they descend upon the research site, with the guards hurrying to form some semblance of a defense against the deluge of claws, blades, and teeth."

    effelai_bloom.316.t:0 "Magical Research Catastrophe"
    effelai_bloom.316.d:0 "As the mages insert a new device into the Effelai's neural network, it suddenly lets out a horrifying shriek, accompanied by a wave of raw magical energy being released into the research tent. As the shriek finally dies down, worried researchers and guards rush in, and are met with a terrible sight; many of the researchers lie motionless on the ground, and the floor is covered with glass from a myriad of broken equipment. Some of the most knowledgeable experts on the Effelai are lost, and we may have lost weeks of progress."
    effelai_bloom.316.a:0 "Focus on replacing the equipment."
    effelai_bloom.316.b:0 "Focus on getting more researchers."
    effelai_bloom.317.t:0 "Slaves to the Song"
    effelai_bloom.317.d:0 "It started with strange behavior. Researchers staring into nothingness, not always responding to people around them, and swaying to what appeared to be music only they could hear. Still, they kept coming to work, talking with their friends, and advancing their research. Until one day, when they started singing. The soldiers attacked them immediately, terrified of the song spreading, but the enthralled mages dispatched them with ease. A new song servant infestation has been created, in the middle of our research site."
    effelai_bloom.317.a:0 "Blinded by their own arrogance"
    effelai_bloom.318.t:0 "A Breakthrough"
    effelai_bloom.318.d:0 "When the neural network started to vibrate in a pattern again, our researchers feared the worst. But when another attack or bout of madness did not happen, One researcher understood. This pattern was not hostile, and it had never been observed anywhere in the network. This was a *message*. And after several weeks of comparing it with earlier vibrations and their effects, he finally delivered to us what he believed to be… an invitation? Not all of our researchers have been convinced of the veracity of his work, but there is finally an air of optimism among the researchers."

    effelai_bloom.320.d:0 "Song. Of course the key was song. How could it have been anything else? Here, at the convergence of the neural network, we sing our questions,  and Effelai answers. The language is complex, and even with the aid of our resonance equipment every song and vibration requires days if not weeks of translation, but the sheer amount of information we are learning is astounding. We are speaking to a creature the size of nearly half the continent, and it is willing to speak back to us."

Why were we called to this place? Desolate ruins covered in vines; devoid of any life, and seemingly peaceful, but merely the sight of it fills us with an overwhelming sense of dread. Our finest craftsmen have worked tirelessly to repair the dilapidated structure, and the first stage of their effort draws near its end.\n\n"

    effelai_bloom.371.d:0 "Our shrine grows ever closer to completion. The illusion of peace within the jungle has been shattered; a wholly new spectrum of color now covers the temple, the air gently vibrating with her anguished song. Even our leader [Root.GetName] has begun to feel the effects from such frequent exposure to our Goddess's influence. That's when "they" approached us.\n\nContorted figures, moreso resembling tortured trees than our own brethren; these "messengers" spoke for our Goddess. Little is known of what was said between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and her servants, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] returned with renewed fervor. It has become abundantly clear that the temple must be completed, and soon. Though with the continued heavy toll on our psyche…what is to become of us when it is completed?"

Many have sought to communicate with them, but they are locked into a dreamlike state.\n\nSeasons have passed, but the jungle has grown into a frenzied array of life. Plants indecipherably alien, even to our weathered eyes, cover the surface of the temple. Once a gentle whim, our Goddess's song now seeks to rend the very air apart with its dizzying melody. It's at the moment when the pitch reaches a shriek, dragging us to our knees, does [Root.Monarch.GetName] emerge from the heart, a blinding aura illuminating their form. The song swelling into a brief chorus, before falling mute as the first words were spoken.\n\n"She has shown me what has been, and what will be. This land was once vibrant and peaceful. Safety came in abundance, fear but a single petal within the jungle's great expanse. It did not last. It could not last. A storm of fire reduced these lands to ash, but she protected us and restored our home. It's now our fate to be united back into her embrace, for a new threat is coming. Outsiders seeking to desecrate our homes, and lay claim to the ashes. We must accept our Goddess's final blessing, and merge our fate with her's."

United by more than borders, but by their connection with our Goddess. Our minds have become a sea of cascading thoughts and emotions; magical gifts have become commonplace, with those particularly gifted reaching even greater heights than before.\n\nWhat once was, shall never be again. With new threats looming on the horizon, it's now our turn to serve as protectors, empowered by our Goddess's love, and newfound unity.\n\nEven when death does find us, our spirits continue to live on within her embrace; their minds able to freely communicate and guide, long after their mortal forms have diminished, and returned to the earth.\n\nWe have only just reached the beginning, and yet we can find comfort that this is our destined end."

Our soldiers, outnumbered and beleaguered, have borne witness to the relentless onslaught of these beings. The losses we have endured weigh heavily upon our hearts, and we find ourselves at a crossroads, compelled to reconsider our methodical approach and devise a new strategy to navigate this ominous battle. Already, our greatest minds endeavour to take on more defensive and cautious advances in the future, leading the vast hosts into killzones which can be exploited repeatedly, but it will take time to recoup the losses in men, materiel, and morale."

Indeed, in the case of the so-called 'song-servants', it seems that is precisely what happens. In [effelai_target_prov.GetName], the songs have grown ever more insidious, and now citizens disappear without a trace. Whether they are newly-minted song-servants or mere victims of the deranged, it certainly hasn't been ideal for morale or productivity."

Indeed, it might even be a wonder to admire, if the migrations were not so incredibly disruptive. An unfortunate settlement in [Root.GetName] was in the way of one of these migrations. There was little to be done for it but to consign the village to destruction and evacuate its residents."

    effelai_bloom.205.d:0 "Though attention has understandably been focused on responding to the Effelai's dangers, farmers have continued to report that some areas have seen exceptional yields in recent years. Now, it appears as though the Effelai's fickle blessings have been visited upon the entirety of [Root.GetName].

To listen intently to these eldritch hymns is to feel the haunting tones press against your very soul; no mere mortal mind can remain unaffected. Fortunately for the government, however, these songs can sometimes be useful -- such as in [effelai_target_prov.GetName], where the population appears to have become remarkably sedate and obedient."

Unfortunately, the jungles have begun to fight back in [effelai_target_prov.GetName], as massive insectile creatures destroy structures, kill livestock, and in at least one case, even slaying an entire family in their homes.\n\nOnce the conflict disipates, all that's left is a sickly song resonating throughout the settlement."

    effelai_bloom.208.d:0 "The Effelai has always been a challenge to colonize. It is a land of mysticality and wonder, though unsuited for any kind of taming, its hostile plantlife and challenging weather making it unappealing for colonization. However, there is no opponent quite like the Effelai itself. Carnivorous plants, shifting and changing landscape, and most of all, the natives. Their sacrifices of song and blood is unnerving to say the least. Their uncanny songs have led many in our colony to be unnerved, being unable to sleep with night terrors haunting their every step. Almost every aspect in our colony has been disrupted, with workers' hands unsteady and administrators unable to sleep."

However, with every misfortune thrown at us, we have found a confounding boon for all our troubles. It appears that during an exceptionally violent upturning of the terrain, the roots and greenery of the jungle have fallen away to reveal something truly amazing: the ruins of an ancient civilization! We have already begun excavation of the site."

On the outskirts of the jungle, where the dense greenery meets the deep marshes of the Leechdens, a monumental battle has just occurred. What we can glean from our witnesses, the Seedthralls of the Effelai and the Leechmen have engaged in a brutal battle. The usually stoic, if not emotionless Seedthralls broke their facade, letting spew forth a song of pure malice and hatred for their enemy, instilling dread in even our military observers. The Leechmen, on the other hand, fought with almost unnatural cunning and fervor, great casualties incurred on both sides. However, despite all this death and destruction, we have been able to glean significant military knowledge from this, learning much from both sides."

Streets lie darkened and abandoned, with a few disfigured corpses lying on the stone of the roads. \n\nSettlements up and down the coast have been left devastated following a coordinated attack by carnivorous plants emerging from the Effelai. Strangely enough, we have the oddest feeling that they were… directed. Like they were trying to drive us out in an animalistic rage. Whatever the case may be, we have been able to beat back the plants, though not without casualty to our own."

Even the natives understand this, and they understood it when they decided to burn almost all of their food sources. Despite all this, we have found an odd source of hope among this devastation: the Effelai itself. \n\nDue to the incredible increase of the activity of the Effelai, once barren land has sprouted new life. Dried lands are born anew with the water, diverted by the deep roots of the Effelai, are irrigated, not by man, but by plant. From trembling sprouts to towering trees, the Burned Coast has seen its first semblance of hope in as far as many can remember."
