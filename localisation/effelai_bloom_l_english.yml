    effelai_bloom.3.t:0 "Effelai Bloom: A Momentous Decision"
    effelai_bloom.3.d:0 "Many of the expeditions into Effelai did not return, and more yet had suffered severe casualties. The information that they were able to bring back with them, however, is immensely valuable. The pulsing mass below the trees was found to be present throughout our territory in the Effelai jungle, forming a vast network. Presumably, it even spreads far beyond our own territory. What is more, it is undeniably and indisputably alive and sentient. All of our expeditions report the same thing: Any form of attacks made against them, be it by Seedthralls, the strange monstrosities that dwell in the jungle, or the trees themselves, all coincided with the network below their feet pulsing heavily. Many have started referring to the thing as Effelai, as they believe that there is no difference between this pulsing network, the jungle itself, and even many of the creatures that live within it. The Effelai, they claim, is a single creature, covering nearly half the continent of Southern Aelantir. And it wants us dead.\n\nThese discoveries have stirred much unrest in the court, and our advisors are deeply split over what the next course of action should be. Most are in agreement that we are, whether we like it or not, are at war with this creature. And in order to win this war, we must cleanse the jungle with fire and steel, and destroy Effelai, root and stem. Either Effelai lives here, or we do. A smaller group of advisors, however, see a different path. The natives of Effelai were able to live alongside it for centuries in relative peace. What is more, we have capabilities that they did not have. If Effelai is indeed intelligent enough to conduct warfare, they argue, it must be intelligent enough to communicate and reason with. If we can make peace with Effelai, and live alongside it, we can form an alliance of a kind that we have never made before. We can plainly see what damage Effelai can do to us; imagine what it could do to our enemies."

    effelai_bloom.301.d:0 "The ritualistic songs that the ruinborn native to the Effelai sing to calm the jungle have generally been believed to be simple superstition. The recent discoveries as to the nature of the Effelai, however, have caused some to call this belief into question. Many adventuring bards have ventured out to sing at exposed parts of the Effelai network, with promising results. Although there is certainly nothing even close to communication, the network undeniably reacts to the songs, pulsing smoothly along with the resonance of the music. Adventurers are now petitioning for an organized effort to seek out the many disparate tribes of the Effelai, and compile their combined knowledge of ritualistic songs for more experimentation."

    effelai_bloom.308.d:0 "The Effelai Bloom has been a great shock to the native ruinborn tribes. To them, it is the wrath of their goddess, known to most of them as Tswohvwoh'íi, the personification of the jungle. As the tribes with very few exceptions had lived very closely intertwined with the jungle, the Effelai Bloom has hit them especially hard, decimating many of their communities.Their ritualistic songs have almost entirely fallen out of use since the Bloom started, as Tswohvwoh'íi would not be calmed by them any longer. They view us with suspicion, as they consider us outsiders part of the reason that all of this has happened. And every single time, as a tribe is approached by our adventurers and legates, they are apprehensive and mistrustful. But every single time, when they are asked for aid to help calm the Effelai, they relent, and agree. We have now gathered a large number of these jungle singers, and their songs are being put on paper for all to learn."

    effelai_bloom.310.d:0 "A great many mages have been very eager to try their hand at establishing communication with Effelai, and have quickly gotten to work. In many disparate attempts, some by single mages, some by large groups, mages have attempted in a multitude of ways to interact with the Effelai network. So far, however, their attempts have yielded no tangible results. Far from being dissagued, however, it has solidified their resolve, as ‘solving the Effelai problem’ becomes a prestige project that every mage wants to be the one to figure out."
    effelai_bloom.310.a:0 "We keep trying."
    effelai_bloom.311.t:0 "Effelai Bloom: A Base of Operations"
    effelai_bloom.311.d:0 "Now that we have a potential way to interact with the Effelai network, we need a secure place to conduct our field research. Previous attempts have often been under threat from Effelai incursions, and if our operation were to come under attack after we have centralized our efforts, it could jeopardize all of our progress. Because of this, we are establishing a small base of operations, guarded and fortified to the best of our abilities against the worst that Effelai can throw at us. The very act of doing so, however, provokes yet more aggression from Effelai, turning it into an effort that has to be continuously adapted, repaired, and improved, in order to maintain conditions as stable as possible for research."

Special preparations have to be made in order to actually keep the stuff burning well. On top of that, the violent reactions of the jungle when the network is harmed make these endeavors extremely dangerous. Because of this, engineers are advising us to set off prepared explosive charges with cannons instead, in order to prevent losing troops as much as possible."
