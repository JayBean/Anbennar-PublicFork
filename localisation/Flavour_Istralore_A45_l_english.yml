 flavor_istralore.1.t:0 "Corinites in the Imperial Army"
 flavor_istralore.1.d:0 "The Dukes of Istralore have long been the traditional marshals of the Empire of Anbennar and as such held sway over the imperial army itself.\n\nShortly after the Corinite Proclamation in 1516, army zealots, who were ostracized within their own military circles, petitioned the Duke of Istralore to support the religion and grant it official legitimacy within the eyes of Anbennarian nobility and the Empire itself."
 flavor_istralore.1.a:0 "The Corinites present a just and righteous cause. I will join you, brothers!"
 flavor_istralore.1.b:0 "Reject the petition."
 flavor_istralore.2.t:0 "Moonhaven Admiral"
 flavor_istralore.2.d:0 "Moonhaven has allowed their admiral Thalanor Seamoon to lead the fleet we're building. Thalanor is very experienced, and a devotee of Munas. This kind of cooperation between humans and elves is what saved Cannor."
 flavor_istralore.2.a:0 "A great admiral for a great fleet."
 flavor_istralore.3.t:0 "Dismantling Wex"
 flavor_istralore.3.d:0 "The grand duchy of Wex was one of the main actors in the dismantling of Dameria. Much of Dameria's land they took for themselves. Now we have the opportunity to do the reverse. We have taken all of Wex's core land, with all the rest being claimed by at least somebody else in the empire. We can give that land away, and even bring back old princes of Anbennar that were conquered by them."
 flavor_istralore.3.a:0 "Dismantle them"
 flavor_istralore.3.b:0 "Spare them"
 flavor_istralore.4.t:0 "Disaster!"
 flavor_istralore.4.d:0 "The emperor of Anbennar, Istralore, has issued an order to partition our country! Basing it off of our dismantling of Dameria after the Lilac Wars, they'll be giving away our land to any neighbors claiming it. With them taking all of our core land for themselves, we are powerless to resist."
 flavor_istralore.4.a:0 "Sorry, you must be losing a multiplayer game real bad right now."
 flavor_istralore.5.t:0 "Dismantling Wex"
 flavor_istralore.5.d:0 "The grand duchy of Wex has been dismantled by the emperor of Anbennar and ruler of Istralore, [A45.Monarch.GetName]! This hearkens back to the dissolution of Dameria after the Lilac Wars. Their remaining land has been given away to various different princes."
 flavor_istralore.5.a:0 "Shocking use of imperial power"
 flavor_istralore.6.t:0 "Trade Thanallen for Whistlepoint"
 flavor_istralore.6.d:0 "The [A45.Monarch.GetTitle] of Istralore has given us an offer. They've conquered our de jure land of Whistlepoint from our rival Cestirande. They would like to trade it to us for the valuable land on the river Luna, Thanallen. We are somewhat indebted to them for eliminating Cestirande."
 flavor_istralore.6.a:0 "We should take this chance to get our de jure land back."
 flavor_istralore.6.b:0 "Thanallen is more valuable than Whistlepoint."
 flavor_istralore.7.t:0 "Thanallen for Whistlepoint"
 flavor_istralore.7.d:0 "Galéinn agreed to trade Thanallen for Whistlepoint!"
 flavor_istralore.7.a:0 "Good"
 flavor_istralore.8.t:0 "No Thanallen for Whistlepoint"
 flavor_istralore.8.d:0 "Galéinn has denied our offer to trade Thanallen for Whistlepoint."
 flavor_istralore.8.a:0 "Well, we still have our claim on it."
 flavor_istralore.9.t:0 "Vassal to Istralore"
 flavor_istralore.9.d:0 "This event shouldn't actually happen anyway"
 flavor_istralore.9.a:0 "Accept the offer"
 flavor_istralore.9.b:0 "Remain independent"
 flavor_istralore.10.t:0 "Istralari Commanders"
 flavor_istralore.10.d:0 "The Regent of Dameria, Emperor of Anbennar, and Duke of Istralore, $EMPERORNAME$ has passed a decree of reform in the imperial army, restructuring it around the Istralari doctrine, including the formation, or rather, reformation of the Istralari Banshees from the War of the Sorcerer-King. This has opened up the Imperial Officer Corp to women of station and skill. As Princes of the Empire, we can take advantage of this new expertise."
 flavor_istralore.10.a:0 "Hopefully this improves our military."
 flavor_istralore.11.t:0 "Levied manpower"
 flavor_istralore.11.d:0 "The emperor of Anbennar and ruler of Istralore $EMPERORNAME$ has acted upon their right to levy 5,000 soldiers from our army for their imperial army. To compensate, we have been paid 50 crowns. It is their strict legal right to do so after reforms they made to the imperial army, and we cannot stop them without leaving the empire. However there is a limit to how often we specifically will be levied, something close to 25 years. Depending on their ability to improve relations."
 flavor_istralore.11.a:0 "Hopefully they don't abuse this."

 A45_remove_wexonard_emperor_title:0 "No Wexonard Emperor"
 A45_remove_wexonard_emperor_desc:0 "At the start of the Fourth Lilac War, much of the empire betrayed Grand Duke of Dameria and rightful emperor Adénn Skylance. An illegitimate election was held by the Rose Party, electing Lothane síl Wex as the emperor before Adénn could return from war, then ambushing him on his return.\n\nAs emperor, Lothane síl Wex destroyed the Grand Duchy of Dameria, partitioning it amongst himself and his conspirators. He would obviously oppose our ambitions to retake Dameria, and he'll be nearly untouchable while still emperor. Even if it means electing somebody else we don't want, the dukes of Wex are the worst choice in the empire."
 A45_reclaim_damerian_dales_title:0 "Reclaim the Dales"
 A45_reclaim_damerian_dales_desc:0 "The Damerian Dales was the heart of our Lords, but was ripped from their body by the Wexonard Emperors after the Great Betrayal. That land is not theirs for the taking, and as the Regents of Dameria, it will once again belong to the Loyal."
 A45_conquer_east_damesear_title:0 "The Dame's East Ear"
 A45_conquer_east_damesear_desc:0 "The Ear was once home of the Damerians, but the Lilac wars finally shattered it. With the Silmuna gone and Dameria just a memory, control of the region should be up to whoever takes it. Wex controls it now. But that does not need to always be the case."
 A45_west_damesear_title:0 "Control the Ear"
 A45_west_damesear_desc:0 "It is of paramount importance that the Damesear be rendered compliant and safe for imperial politics. A helpful Magisterium would do wonders for stability in the region, and is our preferred choice, but we must always consider their support of Wex in the last Imperial Election, and be aware that an allied Mage's Tower may not be possible."
 A45_traitor_wesdam_title:0 "Kinslayer's Sword"
 A45_traitor_wesdam_desc:0 "Despite being led by the Silmuna dynasty, Wesdam betrayed Dameria in the Lilac Wars and fought with Lorent. The last duke of Dameria, Adénn Skylance was slain by a Erlan of Wesdam, a member of the house of Silmuna. Any dynastic claim they have is irrelevant, loyalty is what matters."
 A45_secure_west_dameshead_title:0 "Secure West Dameshead"
 A45_secure_west_dameshead_desc:0 "The West Dameshead has historically been a troublesome border with Lorent looking to take the land from Anbennar. As the emperor, it is our job to secure the West Dameshead."
 A45_historical_ally_title:0 "Moonhaven"
 A45_historical_ally_desc:0 "Moonhaven is our most valuable ally as a fellow loyal vassal of the Grand Duchy of Dameria. We should make an alliance with them before considering any other military matters."
 A45_traitorous_cestirande_title:0 "Traitorous Cestirande"
 A45_traitorous_cestirande_desc:0 "Cestirande used to be a fellow vassal of the Grand Duchy of Dameria. During that time, their knightly orders would constantly compete with ours and we competed for dominance in Dameria's military.\n\nBut that was before the infamously dishonorable Vincen II síl Cestir saw the Fourth Lilac War disadvantaged Dameria, and betrayed us like the support House Silmuna showed them meant nothing. In the aftermath of the war they gained control of the Heartlands, which had previously been directly held by the Grand Dukes.\n\nTheir dishonorable approach to war has given them their snake-like borders - A clear sign of their treachery. Let us skewer this serpent and reclaim the edge of the Luna for honorable Damerians."
 A45_retake_middle_luna_title:0 "Retake Middle Luna"
 A45_retake_middle_luna_desc:0 "The Middle Luna was a part of the Grand Duchy of Dameria before the Lilac Wars. After Dameria's dissolution, it was mostly split into free cities. Galéinn owns part of it, but if we were to retake Galéinn's de jure land of Whistlepoint from their rival Cestirande, they might be interested in trading with us."
 A45_upper_luna_title:0 "Heights of Luna"
 A45_upper_luna_desc:0 "Wex took the heights of the River Luna from the Magisterium during the last war, and this unlawful seizure of land cannot stand. It must return to the Damerian Regents and Anbennar, or we could maybe strike a deal with the Mages themselves, if certain conditions could be met."
 A45_dismantle_wex_title:0 "Dismantle Wex"
 A45_dismantle_wex_desc:0 "The time to strike is at hand, the hated Wex is within our grip. All that is left to take the hills they call home and partition them like the bloody butchers did to our masters during the Lilac War."
 A45_defend_the_borders_title:0 "Defend the Borders"
 A45_defend_the_borders_desc:0 "The Borders must be reinforced, and the enemies thrown back from the gates. We have been turned inwards for too long, dealing with our own troubles and the powers in Wex, but with the Usurper Emperors gone, foreigners now push against The Borders. We must pull tight our ranks and draw a line in the sand. Not an inch of Imperial Land."
 A45_protected_empire_title:0 "An Empire Whole"
 A45_protected_empire_desc:0 "Our territory is inviolate, and the Empire is once again whole. No foreign powers control the ancient lands of the Damerian Emperors and the Lords of Anbennar control their rightful lands, and by the grace of the Regent Gods, it will remain that way."
 A45_vassalize_moonhaven_title:0 "Vassalize Moonhaven"
 A45_vassalize_moonhaven_desc:0 "Moonhaven has been our ally for a long time now. Helping get us to where we are now. Since we've become emperor, and remade Dameria, it is only right that Dameria's vassal become our vassal."
 A45_corinite_military_title:0 "The Red Banners"
 A45_corinite_military_desc:0 "The Dukes of Istralore have long been the traditional marshals of the Empire of Anbennar and as such held sway over the imperial army itself.\n\nShortly after the Corinite Proclamation in 1516, army zealots, who were ostracized within their own military circles, petitioned the Duke of Istralore to support the religion and grant it official legitimacy within the eyes of Anbennarian nobility and the Empire itself."
 A45_corinite_league_title:0 "The Corinite League"
 A45_corinite_league_desc:0 "As both an Elector of the Throne and the Regents of Dameria, we are best suited to lead the Corinite League to enshrine Corin the official heir to Castellos of the Regent Court."
 A45_corinite_empire_title:0 "Corinite Empire"
 A45_corinite_empire_desc:0 "It is time for a new legacy of the Empire. We shall set aside the dusty traditions and worn out ceremonies from the past. It is time for a new age. The Crimson Dawn is upon the Empire."
 A45_damerias_legacy_title:0 "Dameria's Legacy"
 A45_damerias_legacy_desc:0 "We are the inheritors of the Will of Dameria. While our House and Soldiers still stand, the Family of Silmuna will remain as a part of our History. We are the Regents of Istralore. We are the Emperor of Anbennar."
 A45_protect_the_damescrown_title:0 "Protect the Damescrown"
 A45_protect_the_damescrown_desc:0 "The Gawedi and Lorentish would chomp at the bit to cut off pieces of the Empire for themselves, with the Damescrown being the most tempting target, remote to the empire proper as it is. We must make sure that no foreign boot touches our soil, and restore the ancient borders before they become too emboldened in the north."
 A45_rebuild_damerian_army_title:0 "Rebuild the Broken Army"
 A45_rebuild_damerian_army_desc:0 "After the Lilac Wars the army of Istralore has been weakened, but also the army of Dameria which we used to marshal is gone. If we're to reclaim Dameria, we need an army big enough for Dameria."
 A45_military_advisor_title:0 "Military Expertise"
 A45_military_advisor_desc:0 "To truly use our military to its greatest extent, we require leaders and thinkers who envision warfare and battle on scale beyond the wars we fought before. While the geniuses are easy to spot, we must also nurture those who think ahead without being revolutionary. Find the leaders that can guide us step by step, and we need never find the leaps and bounds."
 A45_higher_quality_army_title:0 "An Army Unmatched"
 A45_higher_quality_army_desc:0 "We must push our army ever onwards, defining and refining what it means to fight under our standard. We shall accept nothing lacking in our men or doctrine as we turn our forces into an Army Unmatched to be wielded by our Lords."
 A45_secure_iron_supply_title:0 "Mine the Dales"
 A45_secure_iron_supply_desc:0 "The Damerian Dales have rich iron mines which have supplied Dameria for hundreds of years. The Damerian Dales can be used to get an easy supply of metal for our armies."
 A45_istralari_banshees_mission_title:0 "Istralari Banshees"
 A45_istralari_banshees_mission_desc:0 "During the War of the Sorcerer-King, the Warsinger led her Banshees against the Black Legions. We cannot overlook such chances as we push forward with our own military reforms. Every woman turned away could be another Istralania Warsinger, and we cannot afford to miss such talent."
 A45_marshals_of_the_empire_mission_title:0 "Marshals of the Empire"
 A45_marshals_of_the_empire_mission_desc:0 "Once, we lead the armies of the Empire, marching at the fore under the banner of the moon. Then the traitors shattered the legions of Dameria and Anbennar. Now, we once again rise from the ashes of what was left, to reclaim our position. We no longer lead the armies of the Kingdoms of Anbennar. Istralore IS the armies of Anbennar."
 A45_imperial_army_title:0 "A Legion for an Emperor"
 A45_imperial_army_desc:0 "As Regents of Dameria and Emperors of Anbennar, we have the right and duty to protect all lands within the ancient Borders. To do this, it behooves us to decree a levy upon the member states of the realm for their own protection, strengthening our hand in the face of outside aggressors."
 A45_istralari_commanders_title:0 "College of Warsong"
 A45_istralari_commanders_desc:0 "While the army grows, and so does our knowledge, the accumulation is sporadic and prone to failure if one of our commanders is lost in the field. We shall form a new military academy, the Warsong College, to teach our growing officer corps as we rebuild the imperial bureaucracy of the army into a true Istralanian war machine.\n\nThe creation of the academy will also enable us to pick out the truly gifted, face tracking them to senior positions, no matter their gender. These reforms to the imperial army will allow benefits for all of Anbennar."
 A45_imperial_liberation_title:0 "Imperial Liberation"
 A45_imperial_liberation_desc:0 "Few will bother to fight when princes of the empire are attacked. Many will just leave their land to the attackers, and not press it more than a simple request. But not us, we will liberate the princes that have been conquered unjustly!"
 A45_ally_silverforge_title:0 "Ally the Forge"
 A45_ally_silverforge_desc:0 "Silverforge and Moonhaven are the only other electors that stayed loyal to Dameria in the Lilac Wars. They're a valuable imperial ally, not just for their influence, but also for their fine craftsmanship. Cheaper dwarven-made equipment will benefit our army."
 A45_protect_dameshead_title:0 "Guard the Damesneck"
 A45_protect_dameshead_desc:0 "The Damesneck is the only entrance into the Dameshead, and control of it can keep out unwanted traffic, such as Gnollish pirates, and Lorenti Privateers. While we can not outright blockade the Rosen ports within the Dameshead, a large and powerful defensive fleet in the Neck should limit any unsavory actions taken against the Princes of the Realm. "
 A45_prepare_navy_title:0 "The Sealion Proclamation"
 A45_prepare_navy_desc:0 "Istralore's navy has been an afterthought of the country for too long. The old galleys are no longer relevant in global power. But Istralania was the captain of the Migrant Ship Estádha, and her symbol was a sealion. It is time to rebuild our fleet to proper standards. The first step is building shipyards for the fleet. Then we can issue an extra draft for sailors to run our ships."
 A45_lease_forests_title:0 "Forests of Moonhaven"
 A45_lease_forests_desc:0 "Istralore does not have quite the amount of timber needed to build a fleet, so until we can build up our own reserves it would be a good idea to perhaps lease some timber forests from our ally Moonhaven. This would give us time to grow our own timber fields as well as potentially deepen our bond with our ally."
 A45_moonhaven_admiral_title:0 "Moonhaven Admiral"
 A45_moonhaven_admiral_desc:0 "Until our own officer corps upon the sea is sufficient, we require foreign aid to lead our vessels. We should request an admiral from our fellow elector of Moonhaven, to both lead our navy as well as glean tactics and knowledge of sea going expertise from them."
 A45_construct_sealion_navy_title:0 "The Estádha's Return"
 A45_construct_sealion_navy_desc:0 "To lead this great navy, we'll build a replica of the Migrant Ship Estádha, the ship Istralania herself was the captain of before The Landing. Historians and shipbuilders are studying what remains of it in Anbenncóst's Elvendocks district, and figuring out how it could be remade in a fashion functional with modern technology. Such a ship in our fleet would be an incredible symbol of Istralore, of Dameria, of Anbennar! First, we must construct ships until we can be sure our shipwrights are experienced enough for the task."
