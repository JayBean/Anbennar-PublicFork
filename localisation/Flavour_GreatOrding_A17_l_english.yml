 A17_those_who_fought_desc:0 "We are not the only ones that are in open rebellion against the hegemon of Lencenor. There are others who fight against the tyranny of the Siloriel kings: The Wine Lords of Rubenaire, Eilísin and Wineport chief amongst them. We must befriend the enemies of our enemy in order to prepare for the liberation of Lencenor."
 A17_contact_sorncost_title:0 "Contact Sorncóst"
 A17_contact_sorncost_desc:0 "The Wine Lords of Sorncóst hold many lands and grand armies, yet they are sworn vassals in Lorent’s complex and outdated feudal structure. We should contact those who dissent with the current state of affairs and assure them that they have the support of the Great Ording in their endeavours to change it. Through our combined might, we will grow closer to toppling Lorent’s hegemony in Lencenor."
 A17_stronger_alone_title:0 "Stronger Alone"
 A17_stronger_alone_desc:0 "As our diplomats speak with representatives of Lorent’s vassals, they assure them that they would be stronger alone. Those who bow to Lorent are doomed to be subjugated further and further into the apparatus of the Lorentish state, and only through open dissent against the Siloriels can they finally seek their own path in Lencenor."
 A17_our_stance_known_title:0 "Our Stance Known"
 A17_our_stance_known_desc:0 "If there is one truth about the Ordinger, it is that we are bound to our words. We do not meander around the truth, trying to obscure or tell only half of it. We have made not effort to hide our dissent. Now, the representatives of Lorent summon us to Lorentainé to discuss our attempts at breaking the status quo. And as our diplomat stands in front of the ruler of Lorent, he will say it plainly. "The Great Ording bows to no tyrant.""
 A17_breaking_old_bonds_title:0 "Breaking Old Bonds"
 A17_breaking_old_bonds_desc:0 "The time of pleasantries and intrigue is over. The Great Ording rallies its banners and we prepare to march east. We will retake the Northern Flats in their entirety and break Lorent, or die trying. This war will decide the fate of Lencenor for decades to come. Rally, Ordinger knights, and fight for a new Lencenor!"
 A17_towards_the_future_title:0 "Towards the Future"
 A17_towards_the_future_desc:0 "We have been a steadfast vassal of Lorent since the times of Lorenan, even after his descendants began to measure one’s nobility through the number of elven great-grandparents they may have. When we honoured our vows to enter the Lilac Wars in 1412 and fought against the Derannic, we were promised the lands lost during the Second Lilac War in return. After the end of the Lilac Wars, this promise was broken by the Lorentish King and the West Ording remained in reaverborn hands, Duke Creston IV vowed that this would be the last straw.\n\n Their sins and pomp would make Lorenan himself turn in his grave as he watches all that he worked for be subsumed in hedonism and courtly politics, going so far as to court the descendants of the reavers that massacred our people hundreds of years ago. We cannot allow this to go on, it is imperative that we lay the foundations of our future rebellion through a network of trustworthy allies, both old and new."
 A17_a_great_debt_repaid_title:0 "A Great Debt Repaid"
 A17_a_great_debt_repaid_desc:0 "Those who rode in our final battle against the Derannic did so out of personal duty. Some were asked to fight with horse and spear against their will. Some had nothing to their name when they returned. Now that we have found glory once more, we must share the wealth and peace it provided with those who fought and the families of those who fell.\n\nWe shall ease up conscription among our people and let them enjoy the fruits of their arduous labour. Lands will be granted to our landless knights and men-at-arms and rewards in gold shall be handed out to those already landed. The ruler of Great Ording does not forget its people!"
 A17_unsung_heroes_title:0 "Unsung Heroes"
 A17_unsung_heroes_desc:0 "During our war, many impoverished farmers were made to ride with our armies. While songs are written about the valiant deeds of great knights and lords, these poor souls have for a long time not seen such rewards. Though the Lorentish bluebloods may think it is unsuitable for a nobleman to praise the brave deeds of the poor folk, we are not them.\n\nWrite songs then, of the valiant sheepherder who rode just as valiantly as our knights for the glory of the Great Ording, bring the most brilliant of them to lead our armies! We shall not leave our bravest and brightest unrewarded due to pedantry!"
 A17_protect_our_people_title:0 "Protect Our People"
 A17_protect_our_people_desc:0 "The duchy of the Great Ording was given as a reward for Maugun the Unicorn Knight’s bravery, but the Kings of Lorent also used the mighty and reputable Maugun to check the power of the Dukesof Deranne, who were growing bolder with each passing generation, thus maintaining balance in old Enteben.\n\nAfter Deranne’s betrayal in the Lilac Wars, we fulfilled our duty to punish them for their betrayal and ended the Reaverqueen’s descendants’ rule over old Deranne.\n\nBut our self-determination has not gone unnoticed in the east. By ensuring our control over the key fortifications of our treacherous former rival, we will guarantee that our people are protected from invasions, wherever they may come, and our future foes will struggle to pierce into our heartlands."
 A17_those_left_behind_title:0 "Those Left Behind"
 A17_those_left_behind_desc:0 "The people of Darom have long been overlooked by the King of Lorent. The area is far to the west of Lorentainé, they bear no truly remarkable cities and they are relatively poor in resources and people.\n\nWe will bring them out of the apathy brought by the uncaring rule of the Lorentish king through conscious investments in the region’s defences, and ensure that the plights and grievances of these peoples are finally accounted for and solved posthaste by our knights."
 A17_a_blaze_of_glory_title:0 "A Blaze of Glory"
 A17_a_blaze_of_glory_desc:0 "It is an undeniable truth that the duchy of Great Ording is not as powerful as it once was. Centuries ago, we dominated the entirety of the Northern Flats, our grand cavalry armies were some of the most feared in all of Western Cannor. But after the invasion of the Reaverqueen in the 870s, the devastation brought by the Sorcerer-King and the loss of lands during the Second Lilac War; we find ourselves weaker than ever.\n\nPerhaps our fate is to fall in with the times and be subsumed by Lorentish influence, but the Ordinger knights still remember the names and tales of mighty heroes, Teudur II the Reaverslayer and Duke Maugun the Unicorn-Knight among others. These memories spark a fire in their hearts, a wish to be the next hero that brings glory and fame to the Great Ording, and these memories drive us towards one final charge to reclaim the lands once ours. Whatever our future is, it does not matter, we will make sure to win or die in a true blaze of glory! Arise riders of the Great Ording! Ride to victory or ruin!"
 A17_a_realm_made_whole_title:0 "A Realm made Whole"
 A17_a_realm_made_whole_desc:0 "We have done the unthinkable. We have defeated the Derannic and reclaimed our lands. The valiant charge of our knights has brought us the greatest victory of the Ordingers since the Battle of Clearshore in 860. We have reclaimed the West Ording and righted the wrongs of the Second Lilac War. Finally, the Great Ording of Duke Maugun is whole once more, and we may renew old ambitions."
 A17_memories_of_clearshore_title:0 "Memories of Clearshore"
 A17_memories_of_clearshore_desc:0 "In 860, the famed Reaverking Rangvald invaded the lands of Clearshore with a great host. Heeding the pleas for aid of the people of Clearshore, Teudur II of Ording took the Ordinger knights west to help them drive out the Reaverking. The battle of Clearshore is one of our most reputable victories, where Teudur’s knights charged the invading forces head on. The invaders had underestimated the strength of our cavalry charge and they were routed. Rangvald himself was slain during the battle.\n\nThough the battle was a great victory, Rangvald’s daughter Derhilde the Reaverqueen returned a decade later with a great host and established the Duchy of Deranne, erasing Clearshore from the map and destroying all we had worked so hard to gain. Our rivalry with Deranne over Clearshore persists to this day. If we truly wish to stake our claim to greatness, Deranne must fall under the thundering hooves of our knights."
 A17_erase_reaver_legacy_title:0 "Erase the Reaver Legacy"
 A17_erase_reaver_legacy_desc:0 "Deranne has fallen, and their occupation of Clearshore is finally over after six centuries of oppression. But their mark on the land remains, many Reavers came from their faraway homelands to settle Clearshore and make it their own, mixing with the local population and forming a hybrid culture, denominating themselves the Derannic.\n\nWe cannot allow these Reavers to pride themselves on the ignoble deeds of their ancestors any longer. They will learn to be Lorentish once more, and those that refuse can return to their icy homes in the north."
 A17_protect_the_coasts_title:0 "Protect the Coasts"
 A17_protect_the_coasts_desc:0 "Our conquest of the lands of Clearshore has given us access to the western seas. If there is anything we should learn from the past mistakes of the people of Clearshore, it is that an unprotected coast is one ripe for invasion by our foes. While the knights of the Great Ording are not exactly sailors, there is a great pool of potential candidates in the western shores. Many sailors who once worked for the Derannic lords are now seeking gainful employment, all that we have to provide is a vessel for them to sail and coin to feed their families.\n\nAs our budding navy forms in Westport, we should seek to topple the hegemony of the reaverlords of Reveria in the western seas. We will give them the very same treatment that they gave these shores hundreds of years ago!"
 A17_never_again_title:0 "Never Again"
 A17_never_again_desc:0 "Take pride, knights of Ording, for we have avenged a six hundred year old wrong! The reaverlords’ invasion broke Clearshore and the strength of the Ording, but we were able to defeat them and liberate the lands they stole from the Lorentish. Now little remains of these invaders save for ruined settlements and trinkets stashed away by wealthy traders.\n\nBut it is not enough to have defeated them. They ruled over Westport for six hundred years and the next time that we are broken this may happen all over again. We must fortify the coast, prepare ourselves for whoever or whatever comes next, and elaborate new strategies for our horsemen to apply in battle. We must ensure that no invader can break through Clearshore and cripple us again!"
 A17_farmers_and_fishermen_title:0 "Farmers and Fishermen"
 A17_farmers_and_fishermen_desc:0 "The people of the Shrouded Coast are quiet and reserved. Their lands are not the most productive, most are humble farmers and fishermen, their lords are the poorest in Lencenor and rarely leave their ancient mottes. This dreary place and quiet place is thought best forgotten by the Kings of Lorent.\n\nThey are, nonetheless, a part of old Enteben. They are deserving of law, justice and charity just like any other peoples in our realm. We will revitalise the region as we did with Darom, reconnect it with the rest of Lencenor, listen to their plights and remind them of how, long ago, our peoples lived together under the banner of old Enteben."
 A17_restoration_of_enteben_title:0 "Restoration of Enteben"
 A17_restoration_of_enteben_desc:0 "For too long have the lords of Lorent thought of themselves as above the peasant and their plights, leaving them to suffer and starve while they live in abject luxury. Finally, the people of western Lencenor are once more united. No longer can the Kings of Lorent claim that they have authority over these lands, as we have brought them together and given them renewed purpose. No longer shall we be known as apathetic remnants of a bygone age. The people of Enteben are once more riding together towards a shared destiny, unshackled by the courts of the east and their frivolous disregard for their poorer subjects.\n\nThe Ordinger knight, nay, the Entebenic knight, remembers a time when they were as poor as those they now call their vassals. Their nobility is not granted by the blood of their parents, but by their deeds and their dedication to chivalric values. Here, even the poorest peasant, if shown to be valiant, can rise to knighthood and serve the purposes of their lords.\n\nWe are the worthy lords of a new Enteben. The hooves of our horses shall make the homelands of our rivals tremble!"
 A17_break_rubenaire_title:0 "Break Rubenaire"
 A17_break_rubenaire_desc:0 "The city and castle of Rubenaire are the gateways to the Southern Flats. If we wish to reestablish our hegemony over Lencenor, we must take the city for ourselves and destroy their hold over the southern flatlands."
 A17_fields_of_enteben_title:0 "Fields of Enteben"
 A17_fields_of_enteben_desc:0 "When Lorenan died, his kingdom was split into three; Enteben, Redfort and Carneter. The Entebenic tribes dominated the western flatlands of Lencenor and were ruled by his most able riders. The Entebenic horsemen were feared across Cannor, and every man, woman and child knew how to ride a horse.\n\nThe traditions of these ages past remained alive in the Great Ording, and now that we control the flats of Lencenor, we can finally proclaim that the Ordinger knights are inheritors of Enteben’s legacy, and of Lorenan’s will!"
 A17_forgotten_folk_title:0 "Forgotten Folk"
 A17_forgotten_folk_desc:0 "The Wine Lords only thought of their vineyards along the Bloodwine rivers. The people of Enteben and Saddleglade were forgotten, their only use being breeding the stout Ording workhorse to work the fields of their lords. We are not Wine Lords, and we understand the legacy that these people wish to protect. Through monetary grants and a conscious effort by our administrators, we may breathe new life into the Southern Flats so that they may be proud horsemen once more and breed the finest horses for our knights. Let them know that Ording has not forgotten them, and that Enteben is poised to return!"
 A17_mauguns_people_title:0 "Maugun's People"
 A17_mauguns_people_desc:0 "It does not matter whether an Ordinger knight is from the Ording, or if he hails from the Southern Flats. We ride together with pride. There is no room for pedantry or upturned noses in our armies or in our nobility. Maugun himself was a lowborn soldier who deserted in the war against the Sorcerer-King after the death of his sergeant. Yet he was the one chosen by a unicorn, and he saved the Great Ording from the dark raiders of the east.\n\nWe are all Maugun’s people, inheritors of his bravery and devotion to the Ording. Every Ordinger knight knows that all that matters is to be valiant and to fight for our homeland to the very end, as their past or their ancestry does not define their identity and worth!"

 A17_entebenic_census_title:0 "Entebenic Census"
 A17_entebenic_census_desc:0 "A realm does not grow prosperous on valiant knights and great deeds alone. Comprehensive and gracious day to day ruling is just as great a deed as victory in battle. Enteben has long been disunited and forgotten, we have no real knowledge of how many people live in our realm, what their trades are or how many goods and properties they have to their name. Without this knowledge, the realm rules itself while the King merely oversees and our united purpose cannot be readily achieved.\n\nNow that a new King stands on the throne of Enteben, we must reconcile the realm’s affairs with the King’s affairs. We will send administrators to each corner of the realm to quantify our resources and understand what we truly possess. With this knowledge in hand, it will be much easier for us to coordinate and revitalise the economy of the realm and gear it towards prosperity and strength."
 A17_needs_of_enteben_title:0 "Needs of Enteben"
 A17_needs_of_enteben_desc:0 "If the lord does not provide for their subject, and if they do not hear their plight, can they truly be called a lord? A good ruler must provide for their people and not hold on to their wealth. All that we have, we have because our peasants toil for us. We must give back and invest into the lands of Enteben so our people may have an easier time in their trades and so their grievances may be heard by our administrators."
 A17_unspoken_bond_title:0 "The Unspoken Bond"
 A17_unspoken_bond_desc:0 "The contract between king and subject is a simple one, yet it is of no less import for that - the role of a king is that of guardian, protect and, sometimes, harsh parent. And yet, a kingdom must rely on the common man who must be willing to give their all, for what is a kingdom without its people. When the kingdom lays in crisis, its people should be willing, eager even, to take up arms for its defence. As it would happen, our citizens are so prepared to fight in our defence that they have already procured arms for themselves. All we need do is to say the word."
 A17_greatest_of_horsemen_title:0 "The Greatest of Horsemen"
 A17_greatest_of_horsemen_desc:0 "The Adenicans might be seen as the best horsemen in Cannor, but that is because they're the only ones to advertise it! The riders of Enteben are the best on this continent or the next. They are so good, in fact, that their skill doesn't need to be proclaimed in order to be affirmed. Witness them now; so well-trained are they that they could go from bedroll to saddle in less than a minute's time!"
 A17_finest_of_steeds_title:0 "The Finest of Steeds"
 A17_finest_of_steeds_desc:0 "At the end of the day, however, a rider is only as good as his steed. Even Maugun himself could not salvage a mule as a steed for battle, though he surely could have made a strong attempt. Few could ride a unicorn, but the appeal can be mimicked - strong and fast, able to move just enough at an impressive speed."
 A17_the_ordinger_uhlan_title:0 "The Ordinger Uhlan"
 A17_the_ordinger_uhlan_desc:0 "The Uhlan is the future of cavalry! Horses can be bred to be faster, rather than stronger, and if the troops riding them sacrifice some armour and equipment then they can ride at speeds unmatched by any heavy cavalry. Armed with a lance and an unquenchable spirit, they can ride around enemy formations and flank them even as they think themselves secure. While once there may not have been enough noblemen brave enough to risk themselves in a cavalry charge with our overabundance of new knights, we can easily find brave souls to fill the ranks. With their numbers, the Uhlan can be present everywhere the other soldiers need!"
 A17_the_heroic_charge_title:0 "The Heroic Charge"
 A17_the_heroic_charge_desc:0 "There is little in the world more heroic than a cavalry charge - the realm's greatest and bravest barreling directly for the enemy, risking death, dismemberment, and worse to trample the foe underfoot. Much separate from the growing propensity to sit behind a wall and shoot at the opponent, the bravery required to risk one's life in the charge is an asset that has grown more and more scarce. By instilling our generals with the spirit of the charge, and disseminating it to the rest of the populace, we might assemble a charge to shatter even the zeal of the Corinites!"
 A17_new_chivalry_title:0 "New Chivalry"
 A17_new_chivalry_desc:0 "What is understood to be Cannorian chivalry is, in reality, an Adenican invention - and it is insufficient. Adeanic chivalry dictates a series of partially effective rules, treating the common man as objects and only tending to them as befits the proper maintenance of an object. Entebenic chivalry, however, shall be different! Though there may be nobles and commoners, only the bravest and the most honourable shall become knights, the paragons of society. It is to their example that all will strive - and all of these knights must be worthy of the unicorn, such is the purity of their hearts and the honour of their deeds."
 A17_prepare_the_stables_title:0 "Prepare the Stables"
 A17_prepare_the_stables_desc:0 "It's all very well and good to have a capable cavalry force, but a rider without a proper horse is just a regular soldier. More than that, a bad stable will only make a worse mount. The stables of Enteben need to be fit for a unicorn! Wide, open areas, access to sunlight, and food fit for the most glorious of steeds. These, lined for rows and rows and rows, shall be the stables of the realm, and our horses shall thank us by riding better than ever before."
 A17_lessons_from_lessers_title:0 "Lessons from Lessers"
 A17_lessons_from_lessers_desc:0 "What makes a nobleman a good rider? The only class fit for command? Does pedigree make them any better at their duties? No! The common man, campaigning for years on end, is more than likely just as capable of commanding his fellow soldiers than a nobleman. With the influence of the nobility sufficiently weak, we might begin to integrate these "lessers" into a position where their practical experience might be put to best use."
 A17_knighthood_for_commoners_title:0 "Knighthood for Commoners"
 A17_knighthood_for_commoners_desc:0 "What makes a pure heart? Is it the pedigree of the blood that moves through it? Is it the perceived prestige of one’s titles? Is it the size of one’s estates? No. Just as there are noblemen who would drop their desires at a moment's notice to come to the aid of another, there are many common citizens who would stand as the shining examples of virtue if only we would allow them. Without a doubt, the nobles shall become uppity at the idea that commoners are considered on the same grounds as they for knighthood, but it would seem that we have a brand new class of knights ready to prove themselves!"
 A17_bravery_of_the_common_man_title:0 "Bravery of the Common Man"
 A17_bravery_of_the_common_man_desc:0 "It has only been a scant few years, but the new class of commoner-knights have already proven themselves worthy of the title 'knight'! Any naysayers need only observe that they are virtuous in life, strong in character, and relentless in battle to be convinced that they deserve knighthood as much as any aristocrat! Indeed, to properly honour their bravery, it is due that they be allowed to advance as far as befits their ability and their chivalry, instead of the purity of their blood. "
 A17_battle_of_morban_flats_title:0 "Battle of Morban Flats"
 A17_battle_of_morban_flats_desc:0 "The battle of Morban Flats was a remarkably dramatic scene, whereupon a combined Free Realms army was attacked by a numerically superior force under the domain of the Sorcerer-King. The esteemed general Caylen Longlance oversaw the rout, shattering the Free Realms forces and routing them back to their respective lands. For reasons unknown, he delayed his troops and brought them to loot and celebrate at the former Free Realms camp. Were it not for this, they might all have been shattered... "
 A17_birthplace_of_the_unicorn_knight_title:0 "Birthplace of the Unicorn Knight"
 A17_birthplace_of_the_unicorn_knight_desc:0 "The Unicorn Knight was born in the Redglades, land that is now vassal to the King Lorent. It was here that Maugun wandered in a fit of despair, until he found solace in the discovery of a unicorn. Here, one of the greatest heroes of Cannor was moulded. Though the forest has been given to the elves to tend to as they see fit, the legacy of the lands means that it is of the utmost importance that we see it submit to Enteben. The elves need not even be displaced from their new homeland, so long as they perform their obligations."
 A17_negotiate_entry_title:0 "Negotiate Entry"
 A17_negotiate_entry_desc:0 "The Redglades forest is restricted to non-elves. Intruders are discovered by thorough patrols, then ushered out with an escort (though some rumours persist of particular individuals being kicked, dragged, and even thrown out of the woods) of that same patrol. While some would say we should remove these elves by force, they are within their rights to do so - for they pay their dues and the woods are their home, not ours - but the woods are indisputably important for any who desire to emulate Maugun. A deal must be struck in order to grant the king the jurisdiction necessary to enter the woods."
 A17_memories_of_the_past_title:0 "Memories of the Past"
 A17_memories_of_the_past_desc:0 "The history of Enteben is tied, inexorably, to the history of Maugun, the Unicorn Knight. In order to better understand our country and what must be done to lead it to prosperity, it is necessary to find a deep connection with the Unicorn Knight - by reliving his days and reenacting his deeds, the kingdom will find its future in its past."
 A17_army_of_lencenor_title:0 "Army of Lencenor"
 A17_army_of_lencenor_desc:0 "Once upon a time, when the Sorcerer-King's grip was still strong, Maugun marched alongside the newly arrived elves. There, strangely unharassed by the Sorcerer-King's forces, they raised the banner of the Free Realms in town after town, finding castle after castle deserted. This was concerning, of course - Lencenor was the frontline, and it made sense that it would have many soldiers garrisoning its lands and harassing its people. Which is why the lack of their presence was all the more concerning.\n\nAs the elves marched upon Lorentaine itself, the truth was revealed - the Sorcerer-King's forces had drawn back and concentrated their men into one great host, seeking to crush their new enemies in one decisive battle. Maugun would have died that day, should they have been ready..."
 A17_protect_the_halflings_title:0 "Protect the Halflings"
 A17_protect_the_halflings_desc:0 "To many, the Sorcerer-King was a brute. His men collected taxes, captured subjects, but were generally content to leave the inhabitants by themselves once they had paid their dues. With the halflings, however, things were a different story. The acolytes of the Sorcerer-King held a special hatred for halflings, and the campaign was marked by constant raids and battles given by hordes of half-sized undead. It was against them that Aelcandar was constructed, a garrison-fortress that was able to respond to the undead in such quick time that the dead were relegated to slave labor.\n\nMaugun was here, too, helping to oversee the construction of the fortress and defeating any army that marched to halt its creation."

 A17_the_black_tower_title:0 "The Black Tower"
 A17_the_black_tower_desc:0 "Vertesk had been a Castanorian city from the beginning - well, its infamy certainly was all Castanorian. Home to a dominion, an effective viceroyalty of the larger Castanor, Vertesk was famous for its imposing black tower; it is said that Venac spent many evenings utop the tower, carrying out designs lost to time. It was on the outskirts of this tower that Venac was fated to have died.\n\nWhatever transpired within that tower was known only to the Unicorn Knight. It is said that something lies within - something invaluable for following in Maugun's footsteps..."
 A17_sally_forth_title:0 "Sally Forth!"
 A17_sally_forth_desc:0 "The defeat at Morban Flats led to folly - emboldened by their successes, and drunk off their victory, the Sorcerer-King's men marched onwards to assault Calascandar. It is hard to say what exactly they were attempting - for, by all regards, it seemed as if they desired to sabre-rattle the fort into submission. Perhaps it could have worked, were it not for Maugun, who successfully rallied his army. Some would say he had lungs of damestear, for his command on that fateful day..."
 A17_the_grand_tournament_title:0 "The Grand Tournament"
 A17_the_grand_tournament_desc:0 "Adenica. Enteben. Escann. Cannor. Both of our countries are renowned for their honour and chivalry - yet for entirely different reasons. Adenica embodies some of the earliest chivalry, but it is close-minded, allowing only nobility to serve regardless of true distinction. We, meanwhile, understand the true value of chivalry. It is independent of blood, and that our knighthood is full of only the bravest - for our knights hold the hearts of unicorn riders.\n\nAny sensible man would agree that a knighthood based on valour and merit would produce the better knights, but that is a whole different matter from being able to prove it. Many knights remain, even after Adenica's collapse. Why not invite them for a grand tournament, where we might prove once and for all the triumph of heart over blood?"
 A17_the_broken_kingdom_title:0 "The Broken Kingdom"
 A17_the_broken_kingdom_desc:0 "Originally, the kingdom of Sorncost was a powerful state in Lencenor, arguably as powerful as Lorent and about as influential on its neighbours. Oh, how the mighty have fallen! The Sorncost known today is nothing close to its predecessor, a statelet sharing the name, the location, and not much more. Casna Ola was an important city to the old kingdom - we might be able to eke out concessions from their government in exchange for some of their ancestral land."
 A17_the_southern_bulwark_title:0 "The Southern Bulwark"
 A17_the_southern_bulwark_desc:0 "Even though they do not make up the southern area of Lencenor, the lands around Madalaire, Deranne, and High Ording make up the "Southern Bulwark", a previously-proposed network of fortresses that would ensure that no raids could cross our southern border (or move south, if it comes to it) without expending significant effort. In addition to being incredibly defensible, these fortresses would provide an excellent staging ground for future campaigns."
 A17_a_lone_rose_title:0 "A Lone Rose"
 A17_a_lone_rose_desc:0 "Lorent, once the greatest power in Lencenor, stands alone. Through careful manoeuvring, brave fighting, and perhaps no small sum of luck, the hegemon has been displaced. They stand isolated, such that now it will take a few campaigns to entirely shake their power from Lencenor. "
 A17_rosefall_title:0 "Rosefall"
 A17_rosefall_desc:0 "With the capture of Lorentaine, the kingdom of Lorent is at an end. Though there might still be Siloriels, and the government of Lorent might still exist, it is no longer what it wishes to be - Without the Rose Throne, there can be no legitimate Lorent. Now it is we who hold the hegemony of Lencenor! Push on, for there is yet more that must be done for Enteben and we may yet reclaim Lorenan’s glory!"
 A17_the_greatest_extent_title:0 "The Greatest Extent"
 A17_the_greatest_extent_desc:0 "With the acquisition of Lorenan's Reach, we can say with confidence that we hold the greatest northern extent of Lorenan's old kingdom. Indeed, if we needed any further justification that Enteben is the rightful hegemon of Lencenor, then this would do it. That doesn't mean we can rest, though!\n\nPortions of the Small Country is owned by halfling oligarchs under the pay of human magnates, considering their halfling subjects resources to spend and acquire rather than people to steward. We can stop that - we must stop that! It is only through our guidance that they can prosper as they are meant to!"
 A17_freedom_title:0 "Freedom"
 A17_freedom_desc:0 "The Redfoot halflings, the first group freed by our campaigning, are already quickly settling into life within Enteben.

Its mane was pure white, with a brilliant horn atop its head. [Root.Monarch.GetName] understood that there was to be only one chance at this, and so began a long series of carefully rehearsed steps.\n\nThey knock on a nearby tree three times. The unicorn's head shoots up, gazing into the brush. With slow, measured steps, [Root.Monarch.GetName] steps into view, raising their arms in an inviting fashion.

However, he noticed, more soldiers kept trickling from their camp, and these ones veterans their armour gleaming in the sun and their ranks holding in tight formation. Who knew how long the Lorentish could last. Unless…\n\nMaugun put a horn to his lips and blew two short blasts into it. With a squeeze of his legs, the unicorn immediately shot off at a gallop towards the Castanorian camp. His ragtag band of ordingers, armed with refitted ploughshares and mounted upon workhorses, followed his charge.\n\nThe camp was a mess of activity. A group of Castanorian soldiers attempting to organise themselves, attempting to form up and join battle together into a regiment under the eye of a sergeant. Maugun knew his target. Riding quickly, he and his band targeted the disorganised Castonorian soldiers. The first impact was devastating, with a single strike their sergeant was slain and their order swiftly broken. Believing Maugun’s company to be a second army the Castanorian soldiers quickly fled, causing their comrades in the camp to do similar and, believing themselves to be encircled, soon the whole Castanorian army was in full rout. Seizing opportunity Maugun quickly reorganised his men around his banner and made charge after charge against the fleeing Castanorian forces - it is said Maugun’s band harried the fleeing Castanorian to the borders of the Small Country before the band let up."

There, with their back against an oak tree, it sinks in that the land below is not just countryside - it is their countryside. The individuals below must be permitted to go about their daily lives, [Root.Monarch.GetName] observes, for is that not as important as the need for noblemen like themselves to hunt?\n\nNo matter how vast, or how populated, these individuals needed to be allowed the ability to live their lives free from war, or suffering, or evil.

Maugun and other coalition commanders had time to reflect on this and their solution to the undead was Aelcandar. Simple and yet beautifully elegant. A grand fortress built to withstand a siege for months, from which coalition forces could organise their cavalry, headed by Maugun, could harass legions travelling across the Small Country gradually but effectively nullifying them before they could pose a threat to southern lands."

The battle was in full swing - but it was far from over.\n\nMaugun, Alenn and the others fought hard, pushing their way through the tower. Soldier after soldier fell, Mauguns blade swinging rhythmically through the defenders until none remained. Finally, he found himself at the study of Venac the Arrogant. Venac had remained in the tower, believing his presence could turn the tide of battle. He was nearly correct. Noticing the intruder, Venac threw fire from his fingers and called out.\n”And who are you to think you could defeat Venac the Great?”\nMaugun darted aside, dodging his flames, and decapitated Venac in a single motion.

Even so, the pair watched on as [Root.Monarch.GetName] claimed a chunk of stone from the crumbling interior. The whole scene was supported by the gentle clinking of the second guard squeezing a bag.\n\nA thought crossed [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mind - were these guards not corrupt?

As Maugun approached the river he saw a group of Castanorians already drawing water and, sensing opportunity, he ordered his men to prepare to attack.\n\nThe Castanorian’s were quick to rally to the river, calling for a response from the Free Realms and within two hours, what had begun as a minor skirmish had escalated into full battle with the skirmish’s location marking the northern flank. The battle Maugun could see was going poorly, with the Castanorian forces pushed hard against the Gawedi infantry, sensing disaster Maugun gave the order and his band broke off from the Castanorians they had engaged.
