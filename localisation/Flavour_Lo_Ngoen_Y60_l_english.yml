 lo_ngoen_2_1_title:0 "Seeking Counsel"
 lo_ngoen_2_1_desc:0 "Rama Buakae came to politics only shortly before his election. While he is a good general and knows how to rile up the crowd, his administrative skills are less than desired. We can remedy this by expanding the council around him, installing it with people who support Rama and his ambitions and know how to run a nation. This way Rama can put all his focus on what he does best without having to fear about neglecting internal matters."

 lo_ngoen_2_3_title:0 "Wisdom of The Eldest"
 lo_ngoen_2_3_desc:0 "If we wish to rule a large state, we will need to acquire more knowledge on statecraft, diplomacy and technological advancements. The council suggests getting information from a multitude of sources, both conventional and less so. We can go to libraries, bookmarkets or schools but we should also attempt to gain knowledge via audits with ancestral spirits. Perhaps, we can even snoop around the hold of Verkal Ozovar and take some of their ancient wisdom for ourselves, just like the good old times..."

 lo_ngoen_3_1_title:0 "The Promise"
 lo_ngoen_3_1_desc:0 "The aftermath of the battle at Lektonmai was massive, alongside losing our ruler we lost a great deal of able bodied men and the important copper mines in Lektonmai. We must and will prepare to avenge this humiliation and send Hiderion with his lancers back from whence they came! This is a manifesto that we will make clear not only to our people, but to our long standing allies in Khao Elnak as well."

 lo_ngoen_3_2_title:0 "War of Reconquest"
 lo_ngoen_3_2_desc:0 "The Azkare might call it a war of reconquest, but we know that it will be liberation. Their lancers shall be broken by our proven Silver Shields and soon, the elves of Azkare shall bow down before our might. Once their city falls, we will give the people what we have promised: vengeance. Then we will send the spoils back to our homelands and make sure that Azkare becomes nothing more than a footnote in history."

 lo_ngoen_3_3_title:0 "Lord of The Sikai"
 lo_ngoen_3_3_desc:0 "The time of war has finally ended. What Hiderion and his lancers started has finally been brought to an end, all thanks to us. Under Rama we changed the course of history and grew to the status of a regional power. Rama’s ambitions have become our ambitions, and his ideals have become those of the entire state. \n\nWhile some would call us conquerors, we know that we are the rightful liberators and unifiers of the Sikai. Onward Lo Ngoen, avenge the foreign occupiers, opportunists and the would be monarchs, united will we liberate our kin!"

 lo_ngoen_3_4_title:0 "Thangoya Secured"
 lo_ngoen_3_4_desc:0 "We made sure that the Sikai were united under our guidance and that any enemy of the people was dealt with. Now, we must reorganize the townships into a new state, one fit for the challenge that managing the needs of each local lord will be. So hold a toast - For a safe and secure future!"

 lo_ngoen_4_1_title:0 "Amass Reserves"
 lo_ngoen_4_1_desc:0 "While Rama preaches Kai pride and independence to the common people, he knows that they are not numerous enough to fuel his ambitions. Hiderion was able to defeat even the combined force of Lo Ngoen and Khao Elnak and in doing so exposed our deficit in raw manpower. It is therefore important to seek allies and friends outside of the Kai and ask them for volunteers or support forces. If they help us expand, we will give them a strong and loyal ally."

 lo_ngoen_4_3_title:0 "Radical Solutions"
 lo_ngoen_4_3_desc:0 "Our ambition towards rebuilding Lo Ngoen and unifying the Sikai are costly, so getting more funds is an imperative. Our Master of Mint has proposed to use magic to unearth more silver deposits, though it would have some less desirable consequences as the sudden influx of silver would hurt our economy and the destruction of the local geology will make further mining more risky. But just think about all of the possibilities, when we will be rich!"

 lo_ngoen_event.1.t:0 "The Promise"
 lo_ngoen_event.1.d:0 "There are few things as potent as hatred. It festers, taking over almost every thought. And for the people of Lo Ngoen, this hatred is directed towards Hiderion Tonanzuir, who claims to want to do nothing more than to enlighten the Kai with his idea of ‘noble’ elven overlordship, yet is in reality nothing but another power hungry conqueror, like Jaher and Harimar before him. \n\nAnd while he too feels bitterness towards Hiderion, Rama, as the newly elected ruler of Lo Ngoen knows that this fury inside of him must be channeled in a way that bears fruit without destroying the tree in the process. He is nervous, yet resolute in his desire to give his people hope. Nervous, he stumbles while stepping onto the balcony of the town hall, as sweat drips down from his face. Was it really just the sunshine? He thought, as he prepared to speak before the crowd, that was eager to hear out his words.\n\n“People of Lo Ngoen! Today, I speak to you, and to our fellow comrades in arms in Khao Elnak. I have, just like many of you fought alongside our deceased leader to defend our homes and our people, and just like you I have felt the bitter taste of defeat. Though we may have lost that battle, the banner of our Township still waves over Huban! I stand here as I promise you, and the entire Kai people, that I will not only avenge the defeat at Lektonmai, but that I will also rid all townships of authoritarians, no matter if they are monarchs or dictators. I promise you this, even if it is the last thing I ever do!”"

 lo_ngoen_event.2.t:0 "A Bitter Farewell"
 lo_ngoen_event.2.d:0 "Taking shelter from the rains in Citadel of the Dawn, the nobles of Lo Ngoen and Khao Elnak hold celebrations in honor of their victory over the elven occupier and his country. Drinks and food went around in large quantities, entertainers showed their best tricks, and while these celebrations went on, behind the scenes, lords of the townships came together to divide the spoils. \n\nHow the air turned that day, from a beautiful sunny morning to a clouded and rumbling evening, as if the skies knew what was about to happen. Our lord, in his wisdom, declared that it was only justified for Lo Ngoen to claim the city of Azkare after having sacrificed the most towards the defeat of Hiderion. [Y62.Monarch.GetName] of Khao Elnak was outraged at [ROOT.Monarch.GetName]’s suggestions and stormed out with a clear message: if Lo Ngoen went through with their claims, then Khao Elnak would have no other choice than to break off any diplomatic ties between the two townships and take on a hostile position against [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] and his ambitions.\nDoubling down on the issue, [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] declared that if they dared to oppose him, they would feel the wrath of Lo Ngoen a thousand fold over, making them wish it was Hiderion and his ilk were the ones to subjugate them.\n\nA deafening silence then enveloped the room after which the two parties went outside, both declaring that celebrations were over. Confusion followed over the following days, after which rudimentary borders were drawn to last until a final peace could be settled, one which would come only after swords had clashed once more…"
