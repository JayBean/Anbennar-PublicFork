 G01_looking_to_the_future_title:0 "Looking to the Future"
 G01_looking_to_the_future_desc:0 "Our shamans have long been our window into the future. By conversing with the aspects of the world they are sometimes to gain glimpses into what is to come, allowing us to prepare.\n\nWith the recent calm at our border with the Cheshoni the time has come to look for answers again. Have we beaten them finally back or is this simply the calm before a large raid?"
 G01_search_for_a_path_title:0 "Search for a Path"
 G01_search_for_a_path_desc:0 "Ever since the first portents of danger our shamans and scouts have been scouring both worlds, delving into ever darker parts. We cannot stop. Any help is welcome in averting us what is to come.""
 G01_prepare_a_feast_title:0 "Prepare a Feast"
 G01_prepare_a_feast_desc:0 "A dark pine forest, the light of the full moon shines through the branches, a large grey wolf emerges from between the trees.\n\nIn their scouring of the dream world one of the shamans has come across the wolf spirit. It is willing to help us in return for a favour. Knowing our desperation the shaman has agreed to the terms and the spirit has spoken."
 G01_sating_the_hunger_title:0 "Sating the Hunger"
 G01_sating_the_hunger_desc:0 "First we need to pierce the veil between the waking and dreaming worlds. The shamans have come forward with a ritual to do so, but it will require many sacrifices.\n\nOur hearts bleed as we hear the description of what needs to be done, but what other way is there? Sometimes the herd needs to leave behind a few to ensure the survival of the rest."
 G01_breaking_the_seal_title:0 "Breaking the Seal"
 G01_breaking_the_seal_desc:0 "The beat of drums & chanting fills the air, shamans dancing around a large oak, on its trunk the shape of a large door painted in blood.\n\nThe ritual to break through into the dreaming world is ready. Once prepared our strongest braves and mightiest shamans will enter into the other world and meet our guide there. But first we need to ensure that the path offered is safe. One of our braves has volunteered as a scout."
 G01_a_prophecy_fulfilled_title:0 "A Prophecy Fulfilled"
 G01_a_prophecy_fulfilled_desc:0 " A wolf howl, a flash of crimson light, a figure stumbling away from the large oak.\n\nThe ritual has worked. Our scout has entered into the dreaming world and will meet with the wolf spirit there as promised. He was given a symbol of friendship by the spirit, a wolf catching its own tail, on the scouts flesh. This mark of friendship is to be tattooed on each of our chiefs from now on."
 G01_reject_fate_title:0 "Reject Fate"
 G01_reject_fate_desc:0 "With the gate to the Dotimveb open and contact with the wolf spirit established, time for the final preparations has come. We will not accept the fate laid before us like some trapped hare. We will fight to the end. The Boek will not be forgotten, we will fight and if we die, it will be a death all other tribes will tell stories about until the end of days."


 G01_facing_the_end_title:0 "Facing the End"
 G01_facing_the_end_desc:0 "The time has come to face Fate itself. All preparations have been made. The gate has been set. The war party assembled. They will either do what is required of them or die trying. A last feast has been thrown in their honour. They are heroes of the tribe and will be sent off as such. All we can do now is hope. May their sacrifices ensure the survival of us all."
 G01_stabilize_the_federation_title:0 "Stabilise the Federation"
 G01_stabilize_the_federation_desc:0 "Unlike the tribes surrounding us, we are not one, but 3 people. When working together this is a great advantage, the tribes working together in symbiosis.\n\nRecently, however, the different tribes of the federation are constantly at one another's throat, each with differing opinions on how to save our way of life. We need to work together if we are to survive."
 G01_first_boek_king_title:0 "First Boek King"
 G01_first_boek_king_desc:0 "We are a young nation and have yet to finalise how our federation is to be run. Giving each tribe a voice would keep them content, but would make our government slow and cumbersome, a death sentence while we have to fight off the bloody raids of the Cheshoni. We need a chief that stands above the tribes and is able to mediate between them."
 G01_a_time_for_unity_title:0 "A Time for Unity"
 G01_a_time_for_unity_desc:0 "We have been selfish. We have only taken care of ourselves, not of our fellow tribes. They too, must surely stand to suffer as well once the prophecies have started fulfilling themselves.\n\nWe need to warn our brothers and sisters and offer them a place by the warm fire. In winter the lone warrior dies, while the group that works together survives."
 G01_mocking_death_title:0 "Mocking Death"
 G01_mocking_death_desc:0 "Long ago our people were given a prophecy, said to come from deah itself, that Boek would fall. Now Boek stands strong, and many of foes lie dead at our feats. None will oppose the Kingdom of the Boek. But one foe still remains - we must defeat death itself."
 G01_the_first_foray_title:0 "The First Foray"
 G01_the_first_foray_desc:0 "Ash raining from the sky, ruins covered in moss, a flash of light.\n\nOur shamans have brought new tidings once again. The Aspects indicate that the ruins of the Old Ones hold secrets that will help save us. Long we have avoided the broken stone houses, but in the harsh winter the wolf will also hunt the largest elk. If they offer something that may save us, we must take the opportunity."
 G01_warriors_and_traders_title:0 "Warriors and Traders"
 G01_warriors_and_traders_desc:0 "While the 3 tribes of the federations act as one, that does not mean that each tribe fulfils every duty. We all have our different tasks and specialties, just like different ants in a colony.\n\nWhile the Kaparn venture out to trade with other tribes, the Lenef stay behind as eagle eyed guardians of our land. These differences in duties and outlook has caused friction between the 2 tribes in the past. This foolish bickering cannot be allowed to continue. We are all adults, not young braves squabbling over a hunted deer."
 G01_defender_of_the_boek_title:0 "Defender of the Boek"
 G01_defender_of_the_boek_desc:0 "Our braves have long acted as the shield of the boek. First against Cheshoshi raiders and now against the invaders from across the sea. Nobody fights with as much bravery as the Boek. As long as our hearts and arms remain strong, we will protect our people. Now and forever."

 flavour_boek.1.d:0 "Hundreds of braves laying dead, dozens of burning Dobondotimvebs, a staff throwing lightning and thunder towards a fleeing family.\n\nOur shamans have brought grim tidings. During their last Hohldihla the aspects have warned them of what is to come. Death and destruction are coming to our lands. Not even our families will be safe. The portents are clear, we need to prepare for what is to come. The very survival of our people is at stake."

 flavour_boek.2.t:0 "A Search for a Path"
 flavour_boek.2.d:0 "In our desperate search to avoid the fate prophesied to our people, we have sent many scouting parties out into the wilds and ruins of Noruin in the hopes of finding something that will help us weather what is to come.\n\nEvn’do, one of our bravest war party leaders, has been barely seen since the order has been given, ranging farther and wider than any other of our parties. He hadn't been seen in many moons, many thinking he had perished, but he returned last night with his men.\n\nThe next morning, he immediately seeks an audience with the chiefs. He had spent the last weeks ranging North to the edges of the wastes and there he said he found something. In a half-collapsed ruin he and his man stumbled onto some mutated beast's lair. After slaying it they explored the ruins and stumbled upon an old stone carving, telling of a great force imprisoned further North.\n\nMight this be the answer to our woes?"
 flavour_boek.2.a:0 "We must have this!"
 
 flavour_boek.3.t:0 "The Face of Death?"
 flavour_boek.3.d:0 "You reach the dark black wall that was once the seal and reach out. You reach out to touch the seal and an overwhelming cold takes you. But you are prepared, The Fury protects your mind as it leaves your body, and journeys into the realm of death. The party will wait outside the realm, for facing death is your right alone.\n\nYou enter an empty world. Empty save for your consciousness, and another but this is not who you seek.\n\nYou cry out to it, "You cannot harm me - I have followed the rituals, now take me to your master Beast."\n\nIt speaks with the cold rasping voice of a creature that should be long dead:\n\n"You seek to resist the End of All-Things? You are a fool. For all your preparations you are blind. You are it, we are it. It is the fate of all. To survive is to kill. To exist is to serve. To resist it is to succumb. It has already consumed you."\n\nWith that you wake and you laugh, for the Beast was wrong. The End will not take you. The End cannot take you. You know this, for you hunger."
 flavour_boek.3.a:0 "I am eternal!"
 
 flavour_boek.4.t:0 "The Lost King"
 flavour_boek.4.d:0 "We were foolish to believe this power would serve us. For many days something has been wrong with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Their eyes darken, their flesh grows cold to the touch, their hunger seemed insatiable. Many did not concern themselves, for perhaps this was simply the price to pay for power?\n\nOn the seventh day after their encounter with the great aspect [Root.Monarch.GetName] completed their transformation and, after consuming everyone in the palace, fled. While their whereabouts is currently unconfirmed it is rumoured that they still roam the kingdom, striking down any who they meet."
 flavour_boek.4.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName], and their power, is lost."
 
 flavour_boek.5.t:0 "The Price to Pay"
 flavour_boek.5.d:0 "You and [subject_to_kill.Monarch.GetName] entered the dream together and headed to the location seal. While the rituals have weakened it there is one final sacrifice to be made before we can reach what lies beyond. The Wolf Spirit gave no details as to what would be required, however he instructed our ruler to bring another to aid them in the ritual.\n\nYou return alone, and do not speak of what was done in the dream, and they do not ask. You can still taste the flesh."
 flavour_boek.5.a:0 "This had to be done. For my people"
