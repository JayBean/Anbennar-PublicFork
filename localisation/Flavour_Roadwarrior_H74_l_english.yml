Sometimes you have to throw a bit of fire, or catch the place while some of the defenders are out on patrol.

There’s still plenty to plunder, including much of the metal which made Amldhir famous- Kronium. Heavy, dense and a perfect trophy to symbolize our victory.

At any moment an enemy warband may raid our camp, or a goblin tribe might try to plunder our loot, or one of our raiding parties might come under threat, or a chance to acquire loot that another band may be on the way for.

Orcs to tend to the rig, Orcs to gather supplies, Orcs to sort loot, and Orcs to make sure the previous two groups aren’t taking anything they shouldn’t.

Diamonds, a fantastically durable material that can only be cut by itself or magic, may be the hold’s most famed item, but there’s still plenty of things that the Dwarves here gained by trade with those shiny stones. No reason we can’t- or shouldn’t, do the same… alongside taking that which they gained."

Korgus’ delusions about the surface world merely allowed the dwarven vermin back into our mountains, and took many skilled if deluded warriors to their deaths. But death is not the end, especially for the Roadwarriors. The dead, especially ours who die in battle, shall find themselves mustering an army in the afterlife to free Dookan from his chains! Thus, we should encourage our warriors, if they are to die, to do so in glorious battle, so one day Dookan shall finally be free."

With the fall of Seghdihr to our hand, it is an excellent opportunity to exchange for some of these fruits with a few of the lesser trinkets and baubles we have plundered.
