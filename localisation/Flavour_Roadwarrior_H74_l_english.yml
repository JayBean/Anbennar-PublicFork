Let us make the most of Korgus’ folly, and take to the roads once more."

 H91_stop_for_nothing_desc:0 "Pillaging waits for no one, and if we wait, we might very well lose out on valuable loot taken by other more enterprising individuals. That’s why we Roadwarriors should have a dedicated group of followers to move ahead of the main warband and ensure that the tunnels and caves are clear- that way we have less surprises ahead, and so we can ensure that there’s a clear path ahead."
 H91_in_and_out_title:0 "In and Out"
 H91_in_and_out_desc:0 " Raiding and pillaging isn’t simple work. Despite what some might think, it’s more complicated than simply rushing at an enemy fortification. Sometimes you have to throw a bit of fire, or catch the place while some of the defenders are out on patrol. Regardless of circumstance, prioritizing what and what not to take is paramount in any pillaging spree. A gold candle is both easier to grab and carry off than a silver chair."

There’s still plenty to plunder, including much of the metal which made Amldhir famous- Kronium. Heavy, dense and a perfect trophy to symbolize our victory.

At any moment an enemy warband may raid our camp, or a goblin tribe might try to plunder our loot, or one of our raiding parties might come under threat, or a chance to acquire loot that another band may be on the way for.

Orcs to tend to the rig, Orcs to gather supplies, Orcs to sort loot, and Orcs to make sure the previous two groups aren’t taking anything they shouldn’t. Of course, we also always need able bodies to throw at whatever fool tries to resist our might."

 H91_edge_of_the_world_desc:0 "The edge of the Dwarovar, or all the parts that matter, in any case. Khugdihr is a hold with many stories and tales, but none of those matter but the last- our conquest. Let the surface world burn in the flames of war, whilst we enjoy the cool dark roads we have pried for our own. The Gates of Khugdihr are shut, now and forevermore.

Diamonds, a fantastically durable material that can only be cut by itself or magic, may be the hold’s most famed item, but there’s still plenty of things that the Dwarves here gained by trade with those shiny stones. No reason we can’t- or shouldn’t, do the same… alongside taking that which they gained."

 H91_at_the_gates_desc:0 "Dookan was imprisoned by the ancient dwarven gods, this is well known, even to the most slow-witted orc. Korgus’ delusions about the surface world merely allowed the dwarven vermin back into our mountains, and took many skilled if deluded warriors to their deaths. But death is not the end, especially for the Roadwarriors. The dead, especially ours who die in battle, shall find themselves mustering an army in the afterlife to free Dookan from his chains! Thus, we should encourage our warriors, if they are to die, to do so in glorious battle, so one day Dookan shall finally be free."

 H91_citrines_and_citrus_desc:0 "Seghdihr was once a gateway to the middle Dwarovar, where the fruits of Salahad and Bulwar flowed. With the fall of Seghdihr to our hand, it is an excellent opportunity to exchange for some of these fruits with a few of the lesser trinkets and baubles we have plundered. Something other than fungus and cave meat will do wonders for the Boys."

Now, our warriors control the hold, and with it, its gold reserves. It is the Roadwarrior’s time to pillage what wealth we can, and ensure that none shall ever take advantage of whatever wealth we cannot take with us."

 H91_grozhumdihr_desc:0 "The Green Gate to Rahen, a land of deserts and jungle, home to Men and walking striped beasts. It is in Grozhumdihr that this strange world met with the familiar caves and caverns of the Serpentspine. It is here, as well, the ancient Dwarves gathered that lands’ bounties- and after our efforts, they are ours now! It is well that we have no interest in their land, for the Raj that rules Rahen is weak and pitiful indeed. "
 H91_krakozal_title:0 "Hul-az-Krakazol"
 H91_krakozal_desc:0 "Once the home of the finest dwarven brewmasters, Hul-az-Krakazol now hosts halls full of celebrating Roadwarriors. Once, Krakazol Ale flowed like a stream from taps and kegs throughout this place, and now we have taken the wealth of this great hall for ourselves. Tankards, mugs, cups, equipment for brewing some of the strongest ales known to the world. Now, it is ours, and we shall make better use of it than the Dwarves ever could."
