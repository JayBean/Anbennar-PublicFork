 form_jadd_empire_desc:0 "Under Jaher's leadership the Sun Elves formed the Phoenix Empire as a union between them and the Bulwari people. But the ruling class remained Sun Elven and it was really a direct move for the Sun Elves to claim rulership over the local Bulwari. While that heritage is also ours, we can make a much more enlightened choice. We will now unite the Bulwari people with all others in the true light of Surael. This new Empire will succeed where the Phoenix Empire failed and form a beacon of light and a protection against the darkness for all."
