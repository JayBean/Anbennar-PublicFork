  #missions - Filled with an obscene amount of angst. The following written here is in the context of a slaver hold, an act that is mercifully illegal and recognized for its depravity.
  orldhum_noblesse_oblige_title:0 "Noblesse Oblige"
  orldhum_noblesse_oblige_desc:0 "Restoring the aristocracy of Haraz Orldhûm is not as simple as proclaiming one's self as nobility. Such landed titles have weight; an obligation to one's populace and monarch. This responsibility must be imprinted upon the adventurers we elevate this day so that future generations will not forget their humble origins and grow arrogant."
  
  orldhum_establish_a_perimeter_title:0 "Establish a Perimeter"
  orldhum_establish_a_perimeter_desc:0 "The de jure demesne of Haraz Orldhûm is surrounded by caves and caverns, presenting a danger to the hold if not secured. Fortunately, we were once adventurers and are capable of taming this new frontier. With the aid of our adventurer lords, we can quickly take control of and develop our surroundings for future use."
   
  orldhum_entice_new_nobility_title:0 "Entice New Nobility"
  orldhum_entice_new_nobility_desc:0 "Land: a commodity sought after by all as ownership confers power and social status to those who hold it. We name our brothers-in-arms lords, yet an unlanded noble is only a title above the common rabble. To win their permanent loyalty, we will lease our own crown land to bolster the new nobility. We require an emboldened, but loyal, nobility to truly emulate the Haraz Orldhûm of yore!"
  
  orldhum_platinum_turrets_title:0 "Platinum Turrets"
  orldhum_platinum_turrets_desc:0 "In order to truly emulate our forefathers, we must further entrench our nobility...in this case literally. Our platinum hold was famous for the extensive fortifications built into its surrounding caves and caverns, combining the Serpentspine's environment and Platinum ingenuity to whittle away any invaders foolish enough to besiege the hold. We will restore these turrets and outposts to both better defend our hold and provide opportunities for any unlanded nobility."
  
  orldhum_from_rags_to_riches_title:0 "From Rags to Riches"
  orldhum_from_rags_to_riches_desc:0 "From humble beginnings, our company has shown remarkable growth. Our transition away from an adventuring company to the successors of Haraz Orldhûm requires contemplation: what constitutes a noble?"
  
  orldhum_deck_the_halls_title:0 "Deck the Halls"
  orldhum_deck_the_halls_desc:0 "Though we have restored Haraz Orldhûm to a livable condition, improvements can always be made. These hallowed halls are capable of housing many more facilities and a larger population; we will bolster our home to better accommodate our subjects!"
  
  orldhum_set_up_shop_title:0 "Set Up Shop"
  orldhum_set_up_shop_desc:0 "With the revival of the brutal institution, our hold must be capable of accommodating the large influx of slaves we will be transporting. To this end, we must convince the cartels to cooperate with us in expanding our economic sector. Transforming our hold into an important trade center will be costly, but will pay dividends in the future as our influence expands throughout the Dwarovar."
  
  orldhum_patronizing_platinum_title:0 "Patronizing Platinum"
  orldhum_patronizing_platinum_desc:0 "Our Platinum Dwarf namesake comes from the platinum harvested in Haraz Orldhûm's de jure demesne: the metal being a defining aspect of the hold. It is here the Platinum dwarves crafted fine jewelry made of the metal, such platinum even adorning the ancient Dwarovkron! Despite such grand stories told of the metal, we have yet to discover these deposits within our domain. This has been a thorn in our side since refounding Haraz Orldhûm; we must discover these deposits, whatever the cost!"
  
  orldhum_take_the_reigns_title:0 "Take the ''Reigns''"
  orldhum_take_the_reigns_desc:0 "The time has come to set the power dynamic inside Haraz Orldhûm in stone. We will upset the major factions of the hold with such a power grab, but the aristocracy must be empowered. With our friends in high places, we can employ far more radical changes in Haraz Orldhûm with the aid of the nobility. After all, we are the Place of the Highlords!"
  
  orldhum_impudent_greenskins_title:0 "Impudent Greenskins"
  orldhum_impudent_greenskins_desc:0 "Our company-turned-hold is no stranger to Orcs and Goblins. Their kind doomed the Haraz Orldhûm of old, smothering the hold and bringing it to the ruined state we laid claim to. We will pay back these grudges on the trespassers in the mountain. The successors have returned with civilization in tow; we will teach these squatters some manners."
  
  orldhum_platinum_vengeance_title:0 "Platinum Vengeance"
  orldhum_platinum_vengeance_desc:0 "Our grudge is not yet settled nor may it ever be. The destruction wrought by the greenskins renders the Dwarovar unrecognizable and foreign. More combatants are needed to fuel this reclamation, but prioritizing the military will only starve our populace. Despite its distastefulness, chattel slavery enforced on the Orcs and Goblins could ensure production quotas are maintained while bolstering our available Dwarven manpower. We must experiment; our predecessors' brutal practices may bear fruit..."
  
  orldhum_indenturing_the_locals_title:0 "Indenturing the Locals"
  orldhum_indenturing_the_locals_desc:0 "The trial was more than successful, exceeding our expectations and shattering the doubts we had cast on our predecessors. Though we only trust Dwarves with artisanry, menial labor by the greenskins has greatly improved the amount of goods produced and resources harvested. As such, there is only one logical option: we must obtain more greenskins. We will scour the caves and caverns for their kind and bind them so they may absolve themselves one day.\n\nThis is not Slavery, we are merely indenturing their kind until the day Aul-Dwarov is restored!"
  
  orldhum_domestic_labor_title:0 "Domestic Labor"
  orldhum_domestic_labor_desc:0 "The growth of our hold and domain necessitates an increase in materials for further reclamation. Given the ever-growing indentured masses, we can put them to use meeting labor demands within the hold of Haraz Orldhûm. This population influx will bring unrest, necessitating an expansion of the hold's bureaucracy and its related facilities."
  
  orldhum_magnanimous_exchange_title:0 "Magnanimous Exchange"
  orldhum_magnanimous_exchange_desc:0 "The return of Clan Asra brings an increase in mercantile prowess. The Agate Dwarves, though unsettled by our brutal institution, see a way to further exploit our indentured masses: offloading the excess to Escann. Though devastated by the same greenskins that have brought ruin to the Dwarovar, the destruction wrought has given birth to new countries and the revival of past kingdoms.\n\nThe adventuring companies-turned-countries resonate with us, sharing a similar origin and drive to legitimize themselves. The rebuilding and new development of Escanni infrastructure will be a costly and time-consuming endeavor, unless we provide them a generous offer...\n\nIn a magnanimous manner, we will send envoys to Escanni nations and entice them to purchase our indentured labor, supporting their reconstruction. After all, Dirty Deeds are Done Dirt Cheap!"
  
  orldhum_platinum_waltz_title:0 "Platinum Waltz"
  orldhum_platinum_waltz_desc:0 "Now is the time of Haraz Orldhûm's rebirth! From a ragtag group of adventurers reclaiming an old and decrepit hold, we stand tall and proud; bearing the mantle of the Platinum Successor. Led by the first Highlord in millennia, the hold of platinum chains is alive once more, and the Aml-az-Orlz - The Assembly of Lords, convenes yet again!\n\nThe crown jewel of the aristocracy, Aml-az-Orlz derives from the High Assembly of Aul-Dwarov where all lesser clans and kings of the Dwarovar could petition and discuss notions of rule with the High King. As the Place of the Highlords and the birthhold of many High Kings, our Assembly of Lords will be able to accommodate all aspects of the upper class and captivate our guests with its opulence! Navigating the sensitive issues and many petitions foisted on the Highlord shall not be easy, but we cannot afford to stumble now with our nobles' gaze upon us; The Platinum Waltz has only just begun!"
  
  orldhum_restore_the_west_title:0 "Restore the West"
  orldhum_restore_the_west_desc:0 "From adventuring origins, we have reclaimed our birthright through blood and iron! Despite this, our ambition will not cease; the West Dwarovar must be liberated and reclaimed for our ancestors!"
  
  orldhum_a_grand_reopening_title:0 "A Grand Reopening"
  orldhum_a_grand_reopening_desc:0 "The final hold to fall in the Western Dwarovar and the harbinger of the Greentide, Khugdihr has fallen many times throughout the Dwarovar's history. With proper oversight by us Platinum Dwarves, we will ensure such a fall will never occur again by gaining control over the ruined hold. In disrepair and in a decrepit state, we will restore and reopen Khugdihr to the world at large; a herald to Haraz Orldhûm's rise!"
  
  orldhum_return_of_clan_asra_title:0 "Return of Clan Asra"
  orldhum_return_of_clan_asra_desc:0 "With the restoration of Khugdihr complete, we have announced our reclamation to the surfacers! We must be able to house our returning kin, none more important than Clan Asra. Through Fognir Asra's leadership, the clan has not only survived the fall of Khugdihr, but thrived within the city of Anbenncóst. This dwarf, who in his youth recovered the Pink Agate of Asra and would later go on to found the Asra Bank, has funded several Serpentspine expeditions, his name becoming synonymous with the reclamation. Having such an esteemed clan in our nation would be a source of great prestige for us, perhaps even a symbol of legitimacy. Though hailing from the lost hold of Ovdal Asra, its sister hold of Khugdihr is nevertheless viewed as the Agate Dwarves' ancestral home; we need only persuade them."
  
  orldhum_reestablish_the_agate_dwarves_title:0 "Reestablish the Agate Dwarves"
  orldhum_reestablish_the_agate_dwarves_desc:0 "We have established communications with Clan Asra! Unfortunately for us, they are well aware of the influential position they hold in dwarven society and find us wanting. Proving our legitimacy to rule the Western Dwarovar will test our diplomatic prowess, but the payoff will be worth it. We must convince the clan that we are capable of safeguarding both Khugdihr and the Gem of Asra!"
  
  orldhum_our_mithril_rival_title:0 "Our Mithril Rival"
  orldhum_our_mithril_rival_desc:0 "Delving deeper into the Serpentspine, the tracks lead us towards the old seat of Aul-Dwarov! Such plans must be postponed however as a far greater matter must be attended to: securing control of Mithradhûm. Though the mithril hold is not as important as Amlhdihr, there are many ancient grudges to settle before proceeding onwards to the High Assembly of Aul-Dwarov."
  
  orldhum_eyes_on_the_prize_title:0 "Eyes on the Prize"
  orldhum_eyes_on_the_prize_desc:0 "Mithradhûm, home of the mithril dwarves, is our ancient and storied rival. Their strategic location at the Western flank of Amlhdihr and the legendary reputation brought by their production of Truemetal granted the hold significant influence, enough to sway even the High King of Aul-Dwarov. Despite many High Kings originating from Haraz Orldhûm, they had no choice but to confer support in disputes against their own birthhold, leading to a plethora of grudges between our two holds. With our control secured over the Mithril hold, we have a choice in exacting those grudges."
  
  orldhum_claim_the_crown_title:0 "Claim the Crown"
  orldhum_claim_the_crown_desc:0 "With our grudges settled, our focus renewed, we march on the High Assembly: Amlhdihr, the birthplace of the Old Empire and one of the grandest holds in the Serpentspine; almost able to surpass even Haraz Orldhûm! To know that Orcs and Goblins not only infest the capital of Aul-Dwarov, but are in possession of the lost Dwarovkron fills the Platinum soldiers with revanchism. It is here we not only cement out place as 'First amongst Equals', but also legitimize our claim to the Western Dwarovar as a Highlord!"
  
  orldhum_reinstate_the_stewards_title:0 "Reinstate the Stewards"
  orldhum_reinstate_the_stewards_desc:0 "To truly claim ownership of the Serpent's vale requires the revival of the Orlazammer Stewards. During the days of Aul-Dwarov, the Ramsteel Dwarves were tasked with protecting the terraced farms of the Vale from any foreign invader. Their unwavering loyalty and near-total support to any High King has fostered great relations between our two holds in ages past, separated that we are. With the near unanimous support from the Platinum nobility, let us spoil the Highlord's favorite!"
  
  orldhum_emulate_the_old_title:0 "Emulate the Old"
  orldhum_emulate_the_old_desc:0 "Our hold takes immense pride in our ancestors, vaingloriously boasting of our times before and acting as a herald for its return. To truly emulate them, we should look no further than the Remnant Holds: those who have stood the test of time.\n\nThe Diamond Dwarves of Arg-Ôrdstun hold a rebellious legacy harking back to a time even before Aul-Dwarov. Even under Aul-Dwarov, the Diamond Dwarves' defiance knew no heights, always clashing against the authority of the High King and leading the main opposition in the High Assembly for their own interests. Despite such arrogance, we must grant them a begrudging respect both as our elders and as a long-lived clan. Extending a delegation to these obstinate individuals may allow us to adapt the Diamond Dwarven aplomb for our own nobility, for imitation is the highest form of flattery!"
  
  orldhum_lay_of_the_land_title:0 "Lay of the Land"
  orldhum_lay_of_the_land_desc:0 "To further the opulence of Aml-az-Orlz, we must look west towards the Cannorian courts. To preserve our reputation, only the mightiest of the surface realms will suffice to study from, which draws our gaze to the nations of Lorent and Gawed. Bitter rivals, the two great powers vie with one another to establish hegemony over Western Cannor.\n\nPerhaps we can take this opportunity to act as a neutral mediator between the two nations, bringing an end to their feud!"
  
  orldhum_imperial_affairs_title:0 "Imperial Affairs"
  orldhum_imperial_affairs_desc:0 "The meeting between the Gawedi and Lencori failed spectacularly, but their presence in our court has drawn the eyes of a far grander realm. The Empire of Anbennar has an extensive history behind it, the entity having existed in several forms near the Dameshead for millennia before becoming a decentralized empire composed of princes and electors from many races.\n\nWhile our bold act is still fresh on the Cannorians mind, we will send delegations and missives inviting the Emperor of Anbennar and his retinue of Prince-Electors!"
  
  orldhum_strangers_in_the_night_title:0 "Strangers in the Night"
  orldhum_strangers_in_the_night_desc:0 "Aml-az-Orlz is not only the facilitator of discussions, deals, and petitions; the spreading of hearsay is also prevalent. One particular rumor has caught the attention of the nobility: Immortality. It is said that there are some among the courts of Cannor who seem almost timeless, a consequence of being long-lived, but not a characteristic seen in Humans.\n\nOur interest is piqued, we must delve further into these speculations...perhaps even the Highlord can benefit."
  
  orldhum_feed_the_masses_title:0 "Feed the Masses"
  orldhum_feed_the_masses_desc:0 "With Amlhdihr in our grasp, it is time to look outwards over its domain. It is not an exaggeration to refer to the Serpent's Vale as the heartland of Aul-Dwarov, the terrace farms that used to adorn the Vale grew a significant portion of the empire's food. Though the Vale's irrigation system has become dilapidated with time, securing control over the King's Rock surroundings is paramount to ensuring Amlhdihr's security and restoring the breadbasket of the empire!"
  
  orldhum_scaling_up_production_title:0 "Scaling Up Production"
  orldhum_scaling_up_production_desc:0 "The nooks and crannies of the Serpentspine are home to all manner of creatures, some even sapient and a potential threat. A certain reptilian race holds sway over the caverns east of Haraz Orldhûm, it is in our best interest to subjugate these mongrels."
  
  orldhum_sapphire_and_quartz_title:0 "Sapphire and Quartz"
  orldhum_sapphire_and_quartz_desc:0 "North of Orlazam-az-dihr lie the holds of Dûr-Vazhatun and Krakdhûmvror. Sapphire and Quartz, while the former fell long before all other holds due to the imbecilic act of comprehending the heavens, the latter has managed to hold out against the Orcish onslaught thanks to their isolated position deep in the Giant's Anvil. Stagnant and weak, the hold of exiles and criminals needs a proper Highlord to guide and protect them. As such, we will send a missive to the Remnant hold and await their renewed vassalage!"
  
  orldhum_the_frigid_north_title:0 "The Frigid North"
  orldhum_the_frigid_north_desc:0 "We would be remiss in our reclamation if we did not expand into the Northern Pass. The new frontier is, quite literally, a breath of fresh air from the tedious resettlement of the Dwarovar. Unfortunately, we have heard rumors of tall and gaunt abominations that plague the region; creatures that cannot be felled even by a thousand cuts or a hail of bullets. Nevertheless, Haraz Orldhûm will not be denied the Northern Pass regardless of the foe!"
  
  orldhum_expand_our_supply_title:0 "Expand our Supply"
  orldhum_expand_our_supply_desc:0 "With the success of the Magnanimous Exchange and the fruits of our Indenturement, we must obtain more laborers. No greenskin shall evade our gaze, their actions dooming them to consequences of platinum chains. We will further expand the Chainquarry for our Ostentatious Overseers and develop the institution of slavery. For a brighter tomorrow for all of Dwarvenkind!"
  
  orldhum_diversify_labor_title:0 "Diversify Labor"
  orldhum_diversify_labor_desc:0 "The actions of our ancestors come back to haunt us, the irrigation system that had provided sustenance to all types of produce grown in the Serpent's Vale has flooded the entire region. This not only inhibits any form of agriculture or development in the Serpent's Vale, it also renders the land useless unless we restore the old Dwarovar irrigation system. Our expansion into the Vale is vital for nourishing both our growing populace and the chained masses; we cannot allow some water to impede our ambitions! It also seems even more squatters have attempted to hold control over the flooded region, though they deviate far from the greenskins we have indentured...perhaps we can ''employ'' their services as well?"
  
  orldhum_the_heart_of_darkness_title:0 "The Heart of Darkness"
  orldhum_the_heart_of_darkness_desc:0 "They corrupt the halls of our ancestors, cobbling fragments from the ruin they wrought in a futile attempt to civilize themselves. These verminous monsters attempt to organize themselves into laughable imitations of a state, a mockery brought to life. Their wanton destruction of Aul-Dwarov and perversion of the Dwarovar places an incomprehensible debt on the greenskins; a debt long due to be collected. \n\nThe squatters wish to obtain a hold for themselves, so we Platinum Dwarves, ever generous, are obligated to gift them one wrapped in platinum chains."
  
  orldhum_the_platinum_slave_trade_title:0 "The Platinum Slave Trade"
  orldhum_the_platinum_slave_trade_desc:0 "Our assimilation of the squatters in Er-Natvir has tremendously increased our supply of slaves, allowing us to fully capitalize on the Green Slave Trade. The colonization efforts of the rediscovered Aelantir call for a cheap and numerous labor force, an indentured labor force that we possess in droves! Let us entice the Cannorians by showcasing the effectiveness of the enslaved masses; they will benefit greatly from the fruits of slave labor!"
  
  orldhum_fruits_of_slave_labor_title:0 "Fruits of Slave Labor"
  orldhum_fruits_of_slave_labor_desc:0 "Despite such high sales, our domestic production quotas are still met by the indentured masses we've retained from the Platinum Slave Trade, which can mean only one thing...our labor force is more efficient than we thought! Thanks to the ever vigilant Ostentatious Overseers and the support of the Platinum nobility, our hold will be able to indulge in a windfall of profits from this discovery! All that is required is the consent of the Highlord, the pinnacle of the Nobility, the Lord of the Masses!"
  
  orldhum_surpassing_our_ancestors_title:0 "Surpassing our Ancestors"
  orldhum_surpassing_our_ancestors_desc:0 "We have overcome tribulations that have toppled lesser holds, curtailing an ancient Curse. We have reclaimed the Western Dwarovar and placed its oversight under our hold, the 'First amongst Equals'. We have restored Aul-Dwarov's wonders, the fertile Serpent's Vale once more feeding the masses. We have chained the green invaders, the ones who partook in wanton destruction and depravity...the ones who felled the Haraz Orldhûm of old.\n\nWe stand above the masses, basking in the glory of our achievements. In this instance, we have accomplished a feat unlike any other: The great Aml-az-Orlz grants Haraz Orldhûm an unprecedented amount of prestige, surpassing even our predecessors. We must announce such achievements to the entire Serpentspine!"
  
  orldhum_a_platinum_age_title:0 "A Platinum Age"
  orldhum_a_platinum_age_desc:0 "Reminisce on times past; from the Fall of Aul-Dwarov to the eager Dwarovar Adventurer Company to the successors of Haraz Orldhûm. The estates fall in line under the Highlord, benefitting from the bustling economy fueled by the indentured masses and the extravagant court life of Aml-az-Orlz. A West Dwarovar reclaimed from ruin with its perpetrators clad in Platinum chains, our achievement marks the turn of an Era. Our grand feat will forever place Haraz Orldhûm as First amongst 'Equals'."
  
  orldhum_follow_the_tracks_title:0 "Follow the Tracks"
  orldhum_follow_the_tracks_desc:0 "We must plunge deeper into the Serpentspine to restore the West Dwarovar under Dwarven rule; fortunately our ancestors guide us! The Dwarovrod was an ancient transportation system that connected the many Dwarven holds under the control of Aul-Dwarov before its collapse, its rails converging at our target: Er-Natvir. The Dagrite Hold is a key one to reclaim as the former rail hub of Aul-Dwarov, its central position being a great mustering ground for further reclamation efforts beyond."
  
  orldhum_skulkers_on_the_rail_title:0 "Skulkers on the Rail"
  orldhum_skulkers_on_the_rail_desc:0 "Advancing towards Er-Natvir, signs of something horribly wrong became evident the further down the tracks we reached. For it was not the silent ambience that echoed down the decrepit railways, but the chittering of a pest we had long enslaved: Goblins. The true horror only sets in after the discovery of Er-Natvir; the once great rail station has now become the residence of the green squatters! But fear gives way into anger: these ''Railskulkers'' will not find any mercy under our Ostentatious Overseers for defacing Er-Natvir and subverting the hold!"
  
  orldhum_subsuming_the_masses_title:0 "Subsuming the Masses"
  orldhum_subsuming_the_masses_desc:0 "Such a large influx of Goblins strains the capabilities of our overseers to manage them all! Additional support is required to prop up our brutal institution: we will expand both the facilities of our indentured masses and the numbers of the soldiers who guard them. Similarly, such logistics require the expansion of state infrastructure to accommodate the burgeoning bureaucracy required to maintain our labor system. With time and expense, we will subsume and assimilate these railskulkers into just another greenskin within the indentured masses."
  
  orldhum_fickle_opal_title:0 "Fickle Opal"
  orldhum_fickle_opal_desc:0 "Ah, the capricious hold of Verkal Kozenad...the hold of lowlives and imbeciles obsessed with fate. Our ancestors viewed the hold with much disdain and for good reason! The Opal Dwarves' fickle nature and disregard for integrity made the hold rather arbitrary during Amlharaz debates or clan feuds...that is, if neither side bribed their upper echelon. This had greatly soured our predecessors' opinion of Verkal Kozenad over time, having to dole out their treasuries in order to pass vital legislation in Amlharaz!\n\nFortunately, the only direction their loyalty will shift is towards the Highlord once fully controlled by us!"
  
  orldhum_the_beginning_of_the_end_title:0 "The Beginning of the End"
  orldhum_the_beginning_of_the_end_desc:0 "Mysteries surround the day of Hul-Jorkad's fall to the Orcish invaders even after all this time. Some say it was to punish Gulan-Amekh, the last king of the hold, for his obsession with wealth while others claim the Orcs arose from the foul depths no hold has ever penetrated: the Primeval Serpentdepths.\n\nWhat is certain is that the beginning of Aul-Dwarov's fall began here, the loss of Jorkad Junction dealt a fatal blow that rippled throughout the Dwarovar. If we are to reestablish the Lead Dwarves under Platinum rule, we must ensure the junction is fully fortified from all entry points! Only then can we be certain the West Dwarovar holds will be safe forevermore under a proper Highlord."

  orldhum_old_glory_desc:0 "Our ancestors were truly magnificent! The discovery of the Platinum Warsuit opens up a new form of warfare, of a soldier with the strength of 10 Dwarves! We must thoroughly examine this magical wonder with the aid of our mages to glimpse the wonders of the past!"
  
  orldhum_only_the_finest_title:0 "Only the Finest"
  orldhum_only_the_finest_desc:0 "With an improved understanding of the Warsuit's structure and capabilities, we are able to produce faux Warsuits in its image! Though significantly weaker and exceedingly expensive to create, we can field an enhanced regiment of soldiers! Those who will don this armor must be of noble lineage and clad in merits, only the finest will suffice to wield such power..."
  
  orldhum_improve_upon_perfection_title:0 "Improve upon Perfection"
  orldhum_improve_upon_perfection_desc:0 "The development of the elite guard known as the 'Lords of Platinum' has been a great success! The effectiveness of a faux Warsuit wielder compared to a common soldier is as distinct as platinum in a mine; the Lords of Platinum must be bolstered! We will divert more resources to this project while tightening the standards of eligibility to refine the regiment even further!"

  orldhum_magnum_opus_desc:0 "A legend shall be reborn on this day.\n\nWith significant improvements to technology, the tedious and time-consuming method of producing the Lords of Platinum will be no more! The Age of Artificery is upon us and with its advent comes improved capabilities in harvesting and manufacturing: We will recreate the Platinum Warsuits of yore in such quantity that we can clad all of our soldiers in platinum!"
  
  orldhum_warsuit_enhancements_title:0 "Warsuit Enhancements"
  orldhum_warsuit_enhancements_desc:0 "While our esteemed predecessors' Warsuits are the pinnacle of military technology, the antiquated times they lived in limited the production of such armor. As such, innovation could not truly take place to further refine the Platinum Warsuits...until now. Utilizing an immense amount of resources from our manufactories and the cooperation of the Artificers and Nobles, we have an opportunity to place our own mark on history!"

''I am sure you had a wonderful time witnessing the achievements of our ancestors!'' [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] continues, as the Platinum nobility nod with great enthusiasm, their Cannorian and Escanni counterparts...not so much.

After the good-natured heckling that followed, Highlord [Root.Monarch.GetName] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] glass high as those in attendance follow. ''To the fallen who paved the way!'' they cry, as cups and glasses crash into others. Thus marks the beginning of the main course, a show of Orlazam Lamb paired with options of Red Lineage and even Dwarovar Dark!\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] retreats from the Assembly of Lords, reaching a terrace that cannot muffle the rattling of chains below. Here, the Highlord looks over what they have wrought: the Indentured Masses. ''The most diverse workforce in all of Halann,'' mutters [Root.Monarch.GetName], watching as Orcs, Goblins, Kobolds, Ogres, and even Trolls toil beneath [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]; the institution of slavery fueling the Platinum economy. The truth may be ugly, but the results are undeniable as evidenced by the latest Overseer records. Tearing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze away from the darkness below, [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] turns back towards the bright lights emitting from Aml-az-Orlz. With a final glance back, the Highlord returns to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rightful place at the head of the assembly and oversees the latest spat between a High Lorentish noble and his Gawedi counterpart. Just another session in Haraz Orldhûm, the Hold of High Kings and Platinum Chains."
