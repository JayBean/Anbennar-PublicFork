In orcish society, many half-orcs are seen as outcasts and weak due to their human blood, and a similar lack of prospects arises. In both cases, they often resort to criminal activities to make ends meet. The situation is especially bad in [half_orc_gangs_province.GetName], where the gangs have taken control of several towns and have taken a multitude of businesses under their 'protection'.\n\nOne of our advisors thinks it might be a good idea to recruit those gangs and use them to keep order in the province, while others want to send in the military to take control of the situation.

Moreover, influential half-elves tend to stick together, forming connections that provide them with more and more influence if left unchecked. Taking these two considerations together, a prominent citizen known for hatching half-baked conspiracies has accused several half-elven notables in [Root.GetName] for conspiring against our country and its [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for the benefit of their own kind. These allegations are only barely credible, but we could put this to use to create a significant change in this country in one direction or another..."
