This issue has come to a head as one of our fastest growing towns has encroached on an elven village. The elves have refused to allow their homes to be destroyed, putting the town’s future growth in jeopardy.

It’s no wonder that Elves are often the mistresses of choice for our officials. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue, but one of the most powerful officials at court has recently been discovered to be carrying on an affair behind his wife’s back with an elf. The wronged woman has made this affair into a sensation, and there have been calls to sack the official, lest the elves be able to unduly influence policy via their well-placed seductress. Others have pointed out that sacking the official would show that we distrust any elven influence, and would be seen as an insult to the community. "

As elves have become a more integral part of our nation, there have been rumors that our current administration is the result of a centuries-long plot to make our elites beholden to them. They say that soon, the elves will reduce us all to slaves, all because our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had been controlled by elves from the moment they were born."

Their natural beauty, their sense of purpose, and perhaps a bit of magic, have made for a powerful combination that has inspired admiration from many of our own citizens. So far, the protests have been peaceful and respectful, but they have demanded that their rights be protected. And if they are not the protests may become much less peaceful."

Most soldiers were lucky and had been felled by a single arrow from crack elven marksmen; the unlucky few who did not die became examples of elven bladework. Whatever supplies could not be carried off had been burned. Elven guerillas have become a nuisance that we can no longer ignore. Small, well-disciplined bands have been picking off our patrols and there is no end in sight. Some of our commanders suggest using elven civilians to lay a trap for them, but others have advised to offer an olive branch in hopes of bringing peace with the elven community."

In return, these officials approve construction projects and local ordinances benefiting the lizardfolk community.\n\nPredictably, many figures in our government see this as a dangerous trend that should be stamped out, either through forced purchases of property to dilute the lizardfolk-controlled vote or through more direct administration of our urban centres. More pragmatic figures in your coterie, however, see a simple opportunity for exchange - ally with these pro-Lizardfolk elements and levy their support against our opposition.

One such naga mage has focused his eye on court membership, the highest office he can hope for in a land without a traditional naga aristocracy. Our clergy have objected vociferously, citing the sacred role of the naga in many lizardfolk societies and the implicit endorsement for a foreign faith which they feel such a move would represent. The naga are also notorious for standoffishness and a sense of their own majesty, and there is no guarantee how well this naga would gel with the court."

We do not come out looking particularly well.\n\nOn the one hand, these criticisms are more institutional than philosophical - the polemicist is not arguing for the overthrow of the government, and indeed credits us on a few counts, albeit not nearly as often as he derides us. A few officials have even confided privately that there is merit to some of the criticisms. Opinion is divided over whether the polemicist’s actions should be considered treason or not."

Naga are to be found as the matriarchs of these immigrant neighbourhoods, as business-owners, as unofficial magistrates and problem solvers.\n\nOne such naga has come to us to ask for our help and investment - she represents a pro-government tendency in our lizardfolk population and has a close working relationship with local magistrates. She would like to clear several streets of shanties and build proper housing and an aqueduct for her community, and is asking for investment to do it.

Led by a charismatic naga matriarch who has managed to attract a number of followers, the village maintains a boundary wall and only allows outsiders into a designated trading square. They generally prefer to remain aloof and secluded, largely speak their own language, and enforce territory disputes strictly.\n\nThe peasantry are split - many are content to trade with the settlement and praise the quality of their goods, but a large and vocal minority object to the presence of a community which claims surrounding land (albeit legally) and refuses access. There have been several small scuffles between locals and the lizardfolk over pasture rights and the common use of water sources. The administrators who made the petition also point out the lack of legal oversight over the goings on within the settlement; they urge you to at least force the settlement open for traders and inspectors."

There is no question of who killed them, as a pair of louts have already confessed, but they swear ‘the croc’ attacked first, lost to one of the bloodrages which are known to afflict the Ashhana. This is not attested to by any of the onlookers, and the magistrates’ report considers it highly unlikely that unarmed non-Ashhana would survive such an encounter.\n\nPublic opinion is behind the killers, distrustful of the Ashhana and prone to consider them monstrous. Nervous about inciting unrest, the magistrates have kicked the issue upstairs. It now falls to us to decide how this should be handled."

In this, prejudice, politics and nepotism are valued almost more highly than actual technical genius or successful application, leaving potential breakthroughs discarded, sometimes to never be seen again.\nAlong this line follows a very recent court scandal. One of our most favored court artificers and renowned master of his craft has been framed as nothing less than a plagiarist. Apparently, his latest invention seems to be an almost identical copy of a discarded prototype by an independent goblin artisan, whose proposal was originally rejected by the Gommo, only for the prototype to later be seen fully realized in court among great fanfare by a different creator. An independent investigative commission has begrudgingly examined the goblin's position and found undeniable evidence of wrongdoing by the master artificer, though they remark the inclusion of "substantial technical improvements" and "elementary safety modifications", as well as "significantly decreased chance of explosions"\nThis issue has surfaced underlying tensions between the artificer elite and independent actors, and whatever our answer to this case shall be, it will surely be interpreted as hinting future policy."

The complaints come not from the traders, as they consider the payments to be rather standard, but from the noble, as he wants the "vile beast’s" head to do rather gruesome acts to it.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, since the troll took over, it has been delivering payments with far more consistency than its former noble administrator, leading our sheriff to suspect of embezzlement."

 ogre_tolerance_events.4.d:0 "Ogres are not the most gregarious folk, and many prefer the quiet life on the wild corners of our realm, the hills, crags and swamps where nobody may bother them, which, unfortunately for us, also includes tax collectors. As villages seek to expand their farmland, however, they can come into conflict with these ogres, who consider these fringe areas their lands, with or without writs to support such claims, and with arable land becoming more scarce, these conflicts are growing in frequency. In the province, while draining a nearby swamp, the local peasants have run into a particularly reclusive ogre, who is apparently very fond of throwing projectiles, from overripe onions to live donkeys. Although this is quite anecdotal, we could take this as a chance to set an official policy regarding these cases."

This is not simply a choice of style, as it's blatantly clear ogres are rather tall fellows. With an imposing height of at least ten feet, they positively need larger dwellings than other races, and often find themselves in awkward situations when living in our cities due to their blundering frames. In hopes of remedying this, a delegation of ogre master masons, architects and notables has presented the court with a proposal for a series of sweeping reforms to the standards of construction in our realm, in order to accomodate to the needs of their growing community. Aware of the seemingly daunting costs, they assure this style will not only favor their race, but also our reputation as patrons of the arts."

Even the greenest recruit comes to know of their strange walks into fresh battlefields, to come back into their walled enclosures with large, tightly wrapped bundles. After that, bonfires can be seen lit throughout the night until the break of dawn, the smell of roasted flesh filling the air. \nWhile our generals overlook these ominous practices, content with keeping their best warriors happy, rumors of their nocturnal banquets have started to seep not only around the country, but abroad as well. Already, critics of our rule publish defamatory pamphlets against our armies and government, where "sacrilegious maneating beasts" are among the tamest of adjectives employed. Our chancellor can barely count the volume of pleading letters, from officials to merchants and everything in between exhorting us to take action against this public image catastrophe, one way or another."

The guards scramble to the carved wood gates, and for a short while, the only thing that breaks the silence, is the clanking of their armor, the fast, anxious breaths, and the thumping, rhythmic sounds of something very, very big approaching the door. Suddenly, the steps are silenced, and not even a fly breaks the tension. Then, whatever is out there knocks on the door, too delicately for the stiff ambient. Without lowering its halberd, a guard approaches the gate while it signals to ready for an attack, and after cleaning the cold sweat off his brow, yanks the door open to reveal a towering shape, a monster, a flesh eating giant, and just as the captain opens his mouth to command the attack...

Their giant-like apetite makes them consume far more than regular folk, driving up local prices on their lands and making them a prized clientele for wholesale grain and cattle merchants. Since all food is now valued in account of the potential profit to be made on ogre country, this has worsened the already grave woes of speculation and hoarding, nearly doubling food prices, which has led to agitators rising up in many cities inciting violence against the ogres, who are framed as the culprit of their empty stomachs, unaware that their perceived enemies are also suffering from these inflated costs. Only two solutions are open for us: either we institute a grain dole for the common folk to eat until the market stabilizes itself, or we enforce special laws against the artificial causes of this mess, which will no doubt anger the merchant guilds. With tensions as high as they are, inaction will surely reap innocent victims, be it by debt, starvation, or lynching."
