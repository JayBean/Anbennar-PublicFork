 H33_dream_come_true_title: "A Dream Come True"
 H33_dream_come_true_desc: "As our people leave the safety of the coast and push into the woods, we keep hearing more whispers about weird rumors, strange happenings and outlandish tales that ring just a bit too true.\n\nThe adventurers and men of learning now common in our country point out how the native Boek, who have known these lands for far longer than us, use a secret ritual called the Dance of Dreams to gain insight in this sort of things, and how it is rumored to be especially powerful near Venaan’s Tears."
 H33_the_vincenton_society_title: "The Vincenton Society"
 H33_the_vincenton_society_desc: "Many among the scholars who come to Vincenton these days are members of the Ravelian Society, an organization dedicated to understanding the world and sharing their discoveries. Torrieth herself became a member, and the Society now assists her in studying the God Fragment.\n\nQuite a few of these men and women have open minds, an idiosyncratic approach and have taken great interest in the Trollsbay’s peculiar nature. We should support them in any way we can."
 H33_found_the_bureau_title: "Found the Bureau"
 H33_found_the_bureau_desc: "The Ravelians brought with them the idea that logic and method can solve anything. There are some things that are beyond even magic, which we call Special Cases; and they will be handled one at a time, just like a small stream of water can slice through the mightiest mountain. No unexplained phenomenon shall be a match for our rational cannorian minds.\n\nOfficially, there is no Special Cases Prevention Bureau, of course, as the nature of those things would only make matters worse if their work was public."
 H33_implement_safety_procedures_title: "Safety Procedures"
 H33_implement_safety_procedures_desc: "Each Special Case is unprecedented and requires an entirely different approach from the previous ones. If we are to improve our success rate and limit losses, we must develop entirely new and unprecedented methods to handle them. We need to expand the installations of the Special Cases Prevention Bureau, and send them the greatest minds of our country in all discretion."
 H33_secured_and_neutralized_title: "Secured and Neutralized"
 H33_secured_and_neutralized_desc: "The battle against sinister influences is an uphill one that will not be won in our lifetime, perhaps not even decades from now; but with the work of the Bureau, we have now realized one important thing. It can be won. And eventually, it will be. The Bureau shall have all the resources they need to expand their headquarters so that all solved Special Cases can be secured there."
 H33_finalize_frame_of_government_title: "Finalize the Frame"
 H33_finalize_frame_of_government_desc: "When Varil sína Cymainé was leader of the opposition in Cestaire’s parliament, his proposals for government reforms were considered almost treasonous. Cestirmark was imagined as an opportunity to finally implement them, but his ideas about deriving power from the people, or writing down what the government can or cannot do are considered too radical among the elites that followed him and the negotiations keep dragging on. We should settle the matter and finalize our Frame of Government!"
 H33_welcome_captain_vincen_title: "Welcome Captain Vincen"
 H33_welcome_captain_vincen_desc: "Many groups of adventurers attracted by the rediscovery of Aelantir stopped in Cestirmark, but the one led by captain Vincen was going to change the course of history. Torrieth, she who would become the Godspeaker, was with him, and together they convinced our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to let them set a base west of our capital, which was named Vincenton in honor of the captain.\n\nTorrieth is now spending her time far away, studying the fragment of God they found, but Vincen retired there. Maybe we could convince one of the most experienced adventurer-captains of our time to come out of retirement?"
 H33_secure_path_of_truth_title: "Secure the Path of Truth"
 H33_secure_path_of_truth_desc: "The journey between Vincenton and the God Fragment came to be known as the Path of Truth. Plenty of scholars attempt to walk it to join Torrieth, but it is an arduous one and many elect to just stay in Vincenton and study the fragment from afar.\n\nVincenton is bustling with adventurers, mages and academics of all kinds nowadays; we should expand our facilities for them and secure the start of the Path for those who insist on going."
 H33_common_trade_policy_title: "Common Trade Policy"
 H33_common_trade_policy_desc: "All nations of the bay have vastly different trade interests and most disagreements stem from trade disputes, as everyone wants more for himself and accuses others of setting up unfair tariffs. We shall make it clear to the rest of the world that they’re not trading with a single member, but the Concord as a whole, and turn that weakness into a strength."
 H33_bay_without_borders_title: "A Bay Without Borders"
 H33_bay_without_borders_desc: "In colonial states such as us, the concept of a border is a nebulous one. Even without a clear demarcation, there are still controls for people and tariffs for goods going from Armocsport to Port Isobel, for instance.\n\nThere is little need for suspicion between us, so let any line on the map be only that and focus our bureaucracy on foreign ships instead."
 H33_trollsbayer_universalism_title: "Trollsbayer Universalism"
 H33_trollsbayer_universalism_desc: "Free movement allows our peoples to interact more and Trollsbayer Common includes quite a few bulwari loanwords nowadays. With the increased cooperation between our states, it became obvious that what drives us together is greater than what sets us apart. The Concord shall encourage the promotion of shared values to create a common identity transcending cultures. We will find unity in diversity, and become stronger for it."
 H33_promote_rationalism_title: "Promote Rationalism"
 H33_promote_rationalism_desc: "Now that Saint Torrieth shared the universal Truth with the world, it is only natural that we follow in her steps. We will embody Ravelian virtues, educate the people and teach the Truth of the One God!\nWith the rectors’ focus on unraveling the secrets of the world, the Special Cases Prevention Bureau will have a plethora of great candidates as well…"
 H33_sort_out_archprovostship_title: "The Rival Archprovosts"
 H33_sort_out_archprovostship_desc: "Rectors in charge of a district are called provosts, and especially powerful or prestigious ones archprovost. The Trollsbay is in a unique situation where both Vincenton and Port Isobel have their own archprovost, as the oldest Ravelian presence and the biggest city in the bay respectively. It goes without saying the two can’t see eye to eye and each claim jurisdiction over the entire Trollsbay. This dispute kept escalating until the High Rector demoted them both in 1850 and assigned a single archprovost in Thílvis. We should appeal to the High Rectorate to sort this situation out. Surely we can have an archprovost for each side of the bay and twice the prestige?"
 H33_varils_fancyful_dream_title: "A Fancyful Dream"
 H33_varils_fancyful_dream_desc: "A convinced pacifist, idealist and lover of nature, our founder Varil was disappointed by the state of the Empire in the early 16th century which he perceived as having betrayed its ideals. He always dreamed of seeing this grand dream of harmony and unity revived in the Trollsbay and spent most of his career sending letters to the other rulers of the bay to make it happen, much to their annoyance.\n\nVaril was eventually voted out due to the failure of his policies, died penniless, homeless and forgotten, but never stopped sending letters.\n\nOne can only wonder how different things would have been if Varil’s policies worked…"
 H33_concord_in_trollsbay_title: "Concord in the Trollsbay"
 H33_concord_in_trollsbay_desc: "Historically, the Trollsbay Concord was revived as an idea in 1595, to create a grand alliance spanning the entire bay and increase diplomatic and economic cooperation between Trollsbayers. In the face of encroachment in the Trollsbay by both reclaimer elves, Lorentish colonists and the Sarda emperors, the Concord was officially founded in 1630 to secure the future of the region.\n\nIt will require a lot of concessions, but make us all greater. It is our destiny to lead the nations of the bay!"
 H33_centralize_concord_politics_title: "Centralize the Concord"
 H33_centralize_concord_politics_desc: "While the Concord was at first merely an alliance with benefits, it is now more of a supranational political and economic union.\n\nThis evolution was not really planned and constant bickering slows down every decision; it is now a common saying in the Trollsbay to say of something that will keep being delayed forever it will be done ‘Concord quick’. We shall put a stop to that and provide the Concord with its own administration and officials so that things can finally move forward, while still representing everyone fairly."
 H33_varils_not_so_fancyful_dream_title: "The Dream Realized"
 H33_varils_not_so_fancyful_dream_desc: "What was once a ridiculous idea has now become a reality. The Concord has become in all but name the government of the Trollsbay, and brought peace and prosperity to the region, more than small isolated nations ever could have.\n\nTrue unity is within our grasp. Asking members to transfer even more of their sovereignty to the Concord will no doubt be a controversial move, but we have to proceed. For an ever more harmonious Concord!"
 H33_more_perfect_concord_title: "A more perfect Concord"
 H33_more_perfect_concord_desc: "The time has finally come. We shall seize the Trollsbay’s destiny."
 H33_race_for_the_bay_title: "The Race for the Bay"
 H33_race_for_the_bay_desc: "Our colony was founded on the estuary of the Lansainé river, but growing population forced early Cestirmarkers to look further, at least those wanting their own plot of land. Being made aware that native elves already considered the area theirs, we offered them to settle our border in a friendly race, but not only have the Tehaneks rejected the result, they have also insulted us in return! Without any agreement, our people have claimed all the lands up to the bay to be Cestirmark proper."
 H33_protect_yanek_title: "Protect the Yaneks"
 H33_protect_yanek_desc: "The other reason behind our westward focus was simple: the Bloodgroves are infested with rabid bloodthirsty monsters. The Yanek tribe considers protecting the Trollsbay from their incursions its duty, and we shall aid them in that endeavor. We have to prove our good intentions to them and not let a misunderstanding like with the Tehanek happen again."
 H33_form_the_coalition_title: "Form the Coalition"
 H33_form_the_coalition_desc: "A gruff-looking ruinborn elf with bright purple hair going by Erandil Poison-Arrow recently scaled down the cliffs to explore the lower lands, and came back from the Bloodgroves with secret, monstrous, plans from the reclaimer elves! We Trollsbayers may have our differences, but we have to share this news with the other countries of the bay and bring down this threat together. Up with freedom, down with the stars!"
 H33_join_militias_title: "Join the Militias"
 H33_join_militias_desc: "The disparate militias of the bay would be too uncoordinated in case of invasion, and creating a unified army is out of the question as members of the Concord would rather keep control of their armed forces.\n\nWe shall instead create a elite unit composed of soldiers from the pro-Concord faction, the harmonists. With veterans of the Armocsguard, Thilvisan artillery support, Cestirmarker logistics, and more, it will have the Trollsbay’s finest!"
 H33_gateway_to_the_ynn_title: "Gateway to the Ynn"
 H33_gateway_to_the_ynn_desc: "We have been aware of the existence of a great civilization above the Cliffs of Ruin for some time now. Travel on a massive scale has been so far impossible, but there are projects all over the bay to build great passages to allow trade to go through. It has come to our attention that our location would allow the Concord as a whole to almost achieve a monopoly on that trade, which surely would make us extremely relevant in the long term…"
 H33_anti_colonial_policy_title: "Anti-Colonial Policy"
 H33_anti_colonial_policy_desc: "With the Trollsbay seeing its small colonies become prosperous countries, Cannorian powers are seeking to steal our hard work and turn us into mere colonies! The Concord’s main purpose is to guarantee our independence, and we shall make sure it has the means to do so.\n\nNo matter how much two Trollsbayers can disagree with each other, there’s one thing they will always agree on, and it’s to kick out those damned Lorentish!"
 H33_nationalize_deetic_factories_title: "Seize Deetic Factories"
 H33_nationalize_deetic_factories_desc: "The Deranne Trading Company has built many manufactories and plantations in the Trollsbay, but insists on treating us as unfairly as possible. Their Trollsbayer workers are given bad pay, bad working conditions, and all the profits are shipped back to Cannor rather than being reinvested here. They believe we wouldn’t dare to act against a cannorian entity. Let us remind them this is our land, our people, and our profits."
 H33_stop_trollsbay_plundering_title: "Stop the Plundering"
 H33_stop_trollsbay_plundering_desc: "These days a lot of cannorian ships seem to conveniently lose their flag and somehow find a new one with a skull when near our boats. The situation has gotten so bad it’s not uncommon for merchants to hire diviners before sending their ships. We shall secure the trade route from the Trollsbay to Cannor in its entirety, and make them pay extra to get through!"
 H33_divide_plantation_land_title: "Distribute Plantations"
 H33_divide_plantation_land_desc: "In accordance with our principle of equality, we will divide up the land in small parcels and distribute them among our settlers so that everyone wishing to can have theirs.\n\nUnlike other Trollsbayer plantations owned by filthy rich landowners with hundreds of workers, the Cestirmarker ones are often family owned, with their owners bringing a few orcish slaves to help them and working alongside them in the fields."
 H33_arangreen_shipping_title: "Arangreen Shipping"
 H33_arangreen_shipping_desc: "With an economy focused on growing cash crops to be exported to Cannor and an ever growing production, Cestirmark created a company dedicated to the export of such goods based in Arangreen in 1589.\n\nArangreen Shipping would eventually grow in the centuries into one of the biggest shipping companies, becoming well-known to the general public due to one of their ships unfortunately becoming stuck in the Ardimya canal in the early 20th century."
 H33_support_sella_trade_title: "Support the Sella Trade"
 H33_support_sella_trade_desc: "Our position between the Trollsbay and the Bloodgroves is unfortunate for trade, with most routes bypassing us. We have noticed however that the Sella river is quickly more and more relevant, mainly due to fur trapping. If seaward trade eludes us, we should focus on controlling the inland route!"
 H33_eastern_ynnic_gate_title: "The Eastern Ynnic Gate"
 H33_eastern_ynnic_gate_desc: "The massive cliffs can be seen anywhere in Cestirmark, even from the coast by clear weather. Directly north of our capital, the rocky wall is less of a wall and more of a giant natural staircase, which quite a few people have used to make the trip already.\n\nA dwarf recently approached us with plans to build a giant elevator there which would surely turn the town of Cestirmark into a mandatory stop for any trader wishing to do business with the uplanders! We must send all the needed workforce to Arbeloch."
 H33_more_than_cash_crops_title: "More than Cash Crops"
 H33_more_than_cash_crops_desc: "Our plantations may be numerous, but they are small and struggle to compete against the bigger estates of our neighbors. Meanwhile, processed goods have to be imported at great cost from Cannor; maybe there is simply no need to compete?\nLet us weave our own cotton and increase its value tenfold! The Marllianders may be more profitable for now, but soon enough they’ll all wear fancy Cestirmarker coats."
 H33_adventuring_industry_title: "Adventuring Industry"
 H33_adventuring_industry_desc: "No one is more particular on what they need than adventurers. Nobody else would ask for a pole exactly ten feet long, not one more, not one less, or an amount of caltrops than can fill exactly a five foot square.\n\nAelantir is teeming with adventurers since the continent's rediscovery, and they are always in need of more gear. Not only can many of our plantation’s crops be used to brew potions, we also happen to have very patient smiths! We just need to expand our infrastructure to welcome them."
 H33_livable_cities_title: "Livable Cities"
 H33_livable_cities_desc: "Our capital may be a jewel, but a jewel cannot shine alone. Most of our population lives on the coast, where the produce of orcish labor is weaved, sawed, smithed by honest Cestirmarker artisans.\n\nWe have a duty to provide them with good living conditions, representation, and to make our towns into beautiful places rather than just a space to live. After all, no one has ever wanted to leave, and any rumors about that are just that, rumors."
 H33_union_placeholder_title: "???"
 H33_union_placeholder_desc: "One story ends, another, shared this time, begins. It is too early to tell what fate holds for the Union yet."
 H33_capital_for_the_union_title: "A Capital for the Union"
 H33_capital_for_the_union_desc: "The Union has been ruled from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] so far, as the Concord’s administration was located there when it took over matters of the entire bay, a state of affairs that can only be viewed as favoritism. With our focus shifting from cannorian to aelantiri affairs, we have looked at the estuary of the Ynn, a natural artery that will only gain in importance with time. Cestirmarker and Isobeliner urbanists have worked together to make plans for a city that will not only span each side of the Ynn, but extend vertically up the cliffs as well, with many bridges and walkways. Many people from all over the Trollsbay already started moving to the area to drain the swamps, and this will not be a Cestirmarker, Thilvisan or Zanlibi city, but a truly Trollsbayer one!"
 H33_shadow_under_ynnsmouth_title: "Shadow Under Ynnsmouth"
 H33_shadow_under_ynnsmouth_desc: "The water whispers, of truths that the water knows but were never made for man’s ears. It whispers, and it calls…\nAnd if it does, please report it immediately to the relevant authorities."
 H33_cold_cases_title: "Cold Cases"
 H33_cold_cases_desc: "The Special Cases Prevention Cases has been hard at work, and has solved many Special Cases over the years. Enough, in fact, that the head of the Bureau has approached us recently, fearing that a catastrophic chain reaction could happen with so many of them ‘stored’ in the depths of their headquarters. Some ill effects can already be felt.\n\nIt has been decided the Bureau shall be provided with a new location more appropriate to safely dispose of the most dangerous ones. Fast, if possible."
 H33_complete_our_monopoly_title: "Complete our Monopoly"
 H33_complete_our_monopoly_desc: "Our monopoly on trade with the Ynn is not popular with everyone. It has, in fact, made the otherwise grueling path through the Broken Sea an attractive prospect for many not wanting to deal with our bureaucratic procedures and very reasonable tariffs.\n\nUnfortunately for them, the increasing popularity of this route also means a greater incentive for us to get involved in the far north now that our ships are able to sustain such a long range trip. The parliament has voted the creation of the Verencel Bay Company, and soon our monopoly will be complete."
 H33_from_sea_to_frozen_sea_title: "From Sea to Frozen Sea"
 H33_from_sea_to_frozen_sea_desc: "Rumor has it there should be something more in the frozen north, but this update, the glaciers remain empty."
 H33_not_so_special_anymore_title: "Not So Special Anymore"
 H33_not_so_special_anymore_desc: "Rationalism applied to magic. The brightest minds of the Bureau. Precursor magic able to shape the world around itself. Special Cases Prevention."
 H33_expand_membership_title: "Expand the Membership"
 H33_expand_membership_desc: "Our ideal of unity has so far encompassed only the Trollsbay, due to the circumstances of history. With our rise to prominence and our own affairs sorted, we should offer membership to the other states of Noruin and liberate the people oppressed by colonial powers to welcome them all in our Union!"
 H33_greater_concord_title: "Greater Concord"
 H33_greater_concord_desc: "While our history brought us Trollsbayer closer, the other settlers of Noruin cling to their own identities. Such things are very much still in flux when our states are so young, and who knows? Maybe one day they’ll come to be seen as our brethren, and our country as a grand Noruinic Commonwealth."
 H33_stop_careless_studies_title: "Stop Careless Studies"
 H33_stop_careless_studies_desc: "Vanburia is covered in massive factories and laboratories where precursor creations are dismantled with not only utter disregard for safety, but the express intention of recreating the most dangerous! With the situation so dire, the Bureau has asked to take a more…heavy-handed approach."
 H33_artificers_in_the_bureau_title: "Artificers in the Bureau"
 H33_artificers_in_the_bureau_desc: "The Special Cases Prevention has followed the rise of artificery with great interest. They believe artificers to be perfectly aligned by their values, and are seeking to create an entire department full of them to help both agents in the field and scholars in their research. It will greatly improve the capabilities of the Bureau, and they can already think of a few Special Cases that eluded them so far who will get a nasty surprise."
 H33_reform_our_politics_title: "Reform our Politics"
 H33_reform_our_politics_desc: "Few political systems in the world as are complicated as ours, but as Trollsbayers are quick to point out when confronted about this, at least we have one, rather than an incompetent autocrat making all decisions!\n\nIt is true nonetheless that the multitude of local assemblies, redundant officials and disparate laws due to the previous structures still being in place are quickly becoming a giant, massive headache. Not many know the difference between the Trollsbay Council, Trollsbay Parliament, Council of the Trollsbay, and People’s Concord.\n\nNow that we are one, let us work on a unified set of laws and a single assembly giving fair and sufficient representation to each people of the bay, to guarantee the rights of all Trollsbayers!"
 H33_concord_and_union_title: "Concord and Union"
 H33_concord_and_union_desc: "Now that the institutions of the former Concord have been codified in a more sensible manner, our next reforms shall focus on the government structures of the former members, which are still operating under the Union.\n\nSome propose to recognize them as equals to the central government, arguing that we should keep the spirit of the Concord and derive our authority from the local level. Others believe we should, in the spirit of the Union, let the regions of the Trollsbay govern themselves but keep the balance of power on the side of the central government, which is already representing all Trollsbayers. Of course, both the federal and unitary proposals would keep the different Trollsbay regions highly autonomous."
 H33_will_of_the_people_title: "The Will of the People"
 H33_will_of_the_people_desc: "A strange concept emerged recently in our country. Some thinkers believe that the representation we give to our people is not only necessary for the stability of our country, but in fact part of a social contract where the state gains legitimacy through guaranteeing the people’s rights and that its actions are in turn a mere expression of the general will.\n\nIn accordance with this principle, our ruler and ministers can only act in the best interests of the people, as only representatives can hold these positions."
 H33_unity_through_prosperity_title: "Unity through Prosperity"
 H33_unity_through_prosperity_desc: "The Union enjoys the benefits of both Ynnic trade and the massive plantations of the bay, making us as wealthy as cannorian colonizers, and not many can still claim in good faith this wasn’t the path to follow.\n\nWe could increase those benefits further by reforming our economic system to better fit the demand of either our aelantiri or cannorian partners!"
 H33_review_the_citizenship_title: "Review the Citizenship"
 H33_review_the_citizenship_desc: "Many people living in the Trollsbay still don’t have legal status, whether because they are the descendants of orcish slaves or ruinborn displaced from their lands. We don’t have to let the errors of our ancestors define us. Maybe they too could become citizens if we give them the chance, so we should provide them with the opportunity to become so."
 H33_trollsbayer_identity_title: "Trollsbayer Identity"
 H33_trollsbayer_identity_desc: "There are posh urbanite Trollsbayers, hardy frontiersmen Trollsbayers, bulwari-speaking Trollsbayers, and even halfling Trollsbayers. But in the end, we are all Trollsbayers.\nAnd anyone who comes here and shares our values, which are objectively superior to those of backwards autocracies, can become one as well."
 H33_concord_in_aelantir_title: "Concord in Aelantir"
 H33_concord_in_aelantir_desc: "Once, there was a man with a dream. He believed it would be great if everyone would share his dream and work together towards the greater good. But it was just a dream. Until we made it be.\n\nWe have gone above and beyond what Varil could ever have imagined when Cestirmark was founded. The Trollsbay is the beating heart of Aelantir, our ideals of freedom spread far and wide, and the Bureau will keep Aelantir, nay, Halann safe for decades to come.\n\nAnd yet, is it over? The Season Lords keep infighting in Eordand as once did the Ynn; the Kheionai need support to protect their republics from the warlike Taychendi and greedy colonizers. The Bureau worries about rumors of the world breaking in Sarhal, of precursor complexes failing in Haless, of madness taking root on the edges of the Dwarovar. And as the fires of the Blackpowder revolution rage in Cannor, who will stand against reactionaries and radicalism both?"
 H33_support_vodynnar_title: "Support the Vodynnar"
 H33_support_vodynnar_desc: "Cannorian ideas and weapons had a great impact on the Ynn’s feudal society. Many Ynnics can thankfully see the benefits and have formed a faction known as the Vodynnar to promote progressive ideals. Their rivals however are trying to shut down trade with cannorians and consider us demon spawn!\n\nUnlike Ynnsmen who provided the Vodynnar with troops or weapons, the Trollsbay preferred to send funding and knowledge, much more potent in the right hands, and much harder to track down… and sometimes, welcomed Vodynnar exiles to help coordinate our efforts."
 H33_protect_uplander_republics_title: "Protect Progressives"
 H33_protect_uplander_republics_desc: "We must look after any bastion where progressive thought and individual freedom are still valued, be they Ynnic or fellow Cannorians, as the river-priests and antler knights wish nothing less than their utter destruction! Traditionally such places included republics such as Brelar or Vels Domfan, and we shall offer them to become our sister republics."
 H33_appeal_to_free_classes_title: "Appeal to the Free Classes"
 H33_appeal_to_free_classes_desc: "The feudal lords lie to their populace to keep them under their boot, claiming to their peasants we are the spawn of the demons seeking to destroy them! Thankfully, there are others -merchants, craftsmen, adventurers- who have access to better sources of information and can see the benefits we could provide to them should they happen to be put in power. They only have to ask, and together we will start the Shining Revolution, to cast away the Dark Ages of the Ynn!"
 H33_end_the_dark_ages_title: "End the Dark Ages"
 H33_end_the_dark_ages_desc: "One only has to travel through the Ynn to see the devastating effects of feudalism. Even its once glorious cities are now just big villages by our standards… But this ends now.\n\nWith the obstacles removed, we now have both the will and the ability to help them achieve their true potential… and if it implies more business for Trollsbayer merchant guilds, all the better."
 H33_darantynns_legacy_title: "Darantynn's Legacy"
 H33_darantynns_legacy_desc: "Trhevyr Darantynn was the first merchant to come from the Ynn to the Trollsbay, in the middle of the 16th century. He went completely unnoticed back then, but it would herald an era of increased exchanges between our two regions. With the Trollsbay unified, we now control all the passages leading to the Ynn and the trade going through them is quickly becoming as relevant as our trade with Cannor. We should act to secure our monopoly!"
 H33_untapped_market_title: "An Untapped Market"
 H33_untapped_market_desc: "There is an entire civilization up the cliffs with a massive demand for cannorian goods our Ynnsmen cousins simply cannot provide, which could support the trollsbayer economy by itself and massively cut down on our reliance on Cannor. We should make sure the main trade route, going from Ynnsmouth to Adbrabohvi, has the facilities to handle such a volume."
 H33_ynnic_republicanism_title: "Ynnic Republicanism"
 H33_ynnic_republicanism_desc: "We must not simply protect the few progressive holdouts in the Ynn and send funding to our Vodynnar friends. It is our moral duty to recover their strongholds, spread their influence in any way we can, and send advisors to help them build fairer institutions!"
 H33_maintain_the_balance_title: "Maintain the Balance"
 H33_maintain_the_balance_desc: "The Ynnsmen are fellow cannorians, but life on the frontier made them a bit more…uncouth than the more urban Trollsbayers.\nNonetheless, they will be of great help to promote cannorian values if we were to support them!\n\nBy supporting both Ynnics and Ynnsmen we will make sure the entire valley flourishes at once…and does not unite against us."
 H33_union_of_three_peoples_title: "A Union of Three Peoples"
 H33_union_of_three_peoples_desc: "Trollsbayer, Ynnic, Ynnsman, all working together and benefitting from each other’s prosperity. Where less civilized areas of the world are plagued by infighting and backwardness, North Aelantir towers above."

Some of the most famous Trollsbayer adventurers were determined to get to the bottom of all this. Led by a grizzled descendant of captain Vincen himself, they visited the various native camps seeking expert knowledge to try and solve the many strange occurrences common in our new homeland.\n\nThey were given partial answers, and each time returned to Vincenton with more questions and in an increasingly worried state. First nervous, then frenzied, and finally terrified.\n\nFrom the pieces of occult knowledge gathered throughout Boek shamans, they pieced together a ritual, of which no Ruinborn dared to speak in full themselves. For the great dotimist aspects are of wind, winter, and fire; and at Venaan’s Tears one may see glimpses of beyond this world in the mist of the waterfall, but who can tell what power the water belongs to?\n\nYet under the right circumstances, with the correct preparation, one can see there not other worlds in the mist, but our own. Not as we see it, but as it truly is.\n\nThere, they realized.\n\nThe universe was cold and cruel. But unfortunately, it was not uncaring.\n\nAnd they realized.\n\n‘Ours is lost, like the others.

From that perspective, pursuing an era that will no longer be Cestirmark's, but the Concord's is not a mere option, but a moral imperative.\n\nThe path of the diplomat is a difficult one. He wields the same power as the general, turning the fates of entire nations, carries the same responsability, yet can't get the simplicity of knowing when a battle is won and when it isn't.

The Whisperer wouldn't have exposed itself otherwise. This also was much more than a regular naval battle. Ships had been broken in half by something that was the size of one itself.\n\nBetween the clues recovered in the wreckage before it sank beneath the waves, and what enchanters were able to recover in the minds of the survivors we managed to rescue, the Bureau managed to deduce a location -that thing came from somewhere near the coast of Ynnsmouth.

They made it part of a massive contraption of fine ivory and massive brass gears, delicate porcelain and fragile glass, not unlike a massive gnomish coil, ready to increase its power a thousandfold: the Normalization Anchor.\nWhen activated, it was able to withstand the power for almost a §Psecond§! before collapsing on itself. But for that glorious §Psecond§!, all over Aelantir, unspeakable abominations flickered and simply were §Pno longer§!. Spatial anomalies readjusted themselves without anyone noticing. Cults to powers better left forgotten stood there wondering what they were doing, as the dark magic they were trying to use §Pno longer§! existed and §Pnever had§!. The Warehouse itself was almost ripped apart as huge swathes of its vaults disappeared into §Pnothingness§!.\n\nThere is a variety of opinions on why the Anchor broke down. Some members of the Bureau theorize it tried to normalize itself. Some point out it failed as the field reached the center of Halann, with chilling implications. Others just believe current day artificery is insufficient, and that we need about two centuries of progress to make the Anchor work at full power; but it seems it can still withstand the lowest level of activation for now.

 flavor_cestirmark.401.a: "Seek them, wherever they hide."
 flavor_cestirmark.401.b: "What we need is subtlety."

 flavor_cestirmark.402.t: "Eldritch Rituals Hidden in Constitution"
 flavor_cestirmark.402.d: "One of the Bureau's agents in the government has reported a frightening discovery today. While they are only supposed to act as a contact, they couldn't help but notice familiar patterns during the last session of parliament, when MPs where debating about updating our Constitution. After careful study, it turned out that very specific wording in amendments by influential politicians had sinister motives, and are meant to damn our nation's very soul!\n\nSince most of our elected representatives are not aware of the Bureau's existence, convincing them of the need to act will be an arduous task, but bypassing our democratic institutions would set a dangerous precedent. Regardless, we can't afford not to do something."
 flavor_cestirmark.402.a: "Of course we don’t need an explanation, just remove them!"
 flavor_cestirmark.402.b: "Note down the names and handle this behind closed doors."

 flavor_cestirmark.403.t: "Secret Laws"
 flavor_cestirmark.403.d: "As in any war, the Bureau has greatly improved its arsenal and methods since the Shadow War started thanks to lessons where learnt in tragedy and grief. The Bureau has suggested to implement a series of unofficial laws to handle the occult, that would set a framework to handle warlock and warlock-adjacent activities while still not being made public not to provide knowledge about the eldritch and supernatural to the general populace.\n\nHowever,that would be in direct opposition to our democratic values for obvious reasons. There are two schools of thought about this: the first one believes that we should focus on being as effective as possible during the Shadow War, but have those laws expire as soon as the situation is back to normal. The other considers that the Bureau would fail at its task to protect the soul of the nation if it went against it values, and that those laws should be made in consultation with elected representatives, even if their memory has to be wiped afterwards."
 flavor_cestirmark.403.a: "Assume everyone we find has already sold their soul."
 flavor_cestirmark.403.b: "People should be allowed to defend themselves."

 flavor_cestirmark.404.t: "Cultists drop the mask!"
 flavor_cestirmark.404.d: "The region of [cultist_province.GetName] has always had a great reputation with all visitors claiming it was so nice they never wanted to leave. It seemed like a haven of stability during the Shadow War. On the surface, at least. Reports from the Special Cases Prevention Bureau revealed that a massive underground cult secretely controlled the entire region, and were monitoring their activities. Now, our agents report that the cult used the chaos of the Shadow War to take direct control of [cultist_province.GetName]!"
 flavor_cestirmark.404.a: "Their overconfidence will be their undoing."

 flavor_cestirmark.405.t: "Suspicion towards mages"
 flavor_cestirmark.405.d: "The folks of the colonial frontier are a honest but simple sort. While to the Bureau, the various nuances between a crytogeometrist or a liminal warlock are self-explanatory, most homesteaders will put all the people able to do magic in a single category.\n\nWith the increase in general weirdness due to the Shadow War, regular people have been getting more and more wary of anything unusual. Our efforts to hide the exact nature of the threats to prevent more from joining have been successful and on one hand, most people are not sure what a cultist or eldritch creatures are, but on the other they sure know mages are weird, so many believe they're the same thing. Anti-mage sentiment is growing."
 flavor_cestirmark.405.a: "The shadows whisper of conspiracy!"
 flavor_cestirmark.405.b: "Can one learn what he thinks he knows?"

 flavor_cestirmark.406.t: "Advisor dabbles in thaumaturgy"
 flavor_cestirmark.406.d: "During a series of investigations, the Special Cases Prevention Bureau has discovered eldritch artefacts and occult knowledge in the possession of none other than one of our highest ranking advisors! When confronted, they did not deny the accusations however, and immediately confessed they did in fact study eldritch knowledge -but not for their own benefit, they claimed. For the good of the entire nation, as how can one govern the country during the Shadow War without knowning anything about what Cestirmark is facing? This was their argument at least, and the Bureau can definitely agree with it, since they share the same opinion and methods. The question is if we can trust them."
 flavor_cestirmark.406.a: "Curiosity, interest, and obsession carry one on the road to damnation. "
 flavor_cestirmark.406.b: "To fight the abyss, one must know it... "

 flavor_cestirmark.407.t: "Horrors roam the land"
 flavor_cestirmark.407.d: "With the chaos of the Shadow War, keeping every single thing under wraps is simply impossible for the Bureau. Not everything can be stopped in time, and some things are worse than others. Sometimes it's just rumors about weird-looking things sighted from afar; sometimes an odd story about a place that shouldn't be; but sometimes... Well, let's just say that no one should ever have to see something like what happened today."
 flavor_cestirmark.407.a: "A terrifying display."
 flavor_cestirmark.407.b: "Houses can be rebuilt, wounds can be healed, but the mind…"

 flavor_cestirmark.408.t: "Control"
 flavor_cestirmark.408.d: "The Special Cases Prevention Bureau has given us the first report that didn't include any incident since several years today. Eldritch entities lie in the darkness, but with few to heed their calls anymore; rumors of unexplained disappearances talk about cats and no longer entire villages; superstitions are once again about silly beliefs and those that hold actual power are few. The agents of the Bureau -those that are left, at least- can finally breathe and congratulate themselves.\n\nThis is not a war won, but a battle: if we keep our guard down, this will happen again. We are holding a tide that is the world itself. If we want to stop it for good, the Bureau will need to be greatly expanded. But for now, the situation is back under control."
 flavor_cestirmark.408.a: "These nightmares can be felled. They can be beaten. And they have been!"
