 eordellon.3.t:0 "Festival"
 eordellon.3.spring:0 "Our particular devotion to the Spring as of late has inspired a festival dedicated entirely to the season. As countless flowers begin to bloom, many are picked and gathered together in a grand display of the bounty of Spring. Friends and family gather together, often for the first time in months, and enjoy the mild warmth and cool breeze of the season. Picnics and feasts are a common occurrence, and the tone is generally one of jubilation and abundance."
 eordellon.3.summer:0 "Our particular devotion to the Summer as of late has inspired a festival dedicated entirely to the season. This has included numerous parties being held along the beaches of our nation, with many of our citizens enjoying a relaxing swim or boat ride to cool off from the summer heat. With food still plentiful and abundant, these parties are well catered indeed. All around, the mood is one of carefree optimism and playfulness."
 eordellon.3.autumn:0 "Our particular devotion to Autumn as of late has inspired a festival dedicated entirely to the season. Communities gather together to give thanks for the buffer between the warmer seasons and Winter's grasp, and to enjoy one another's company outside. As the leaves begin to turn and fall, many are collected and used as decoration, be it for homes or as part of gifts to the fey. In general, it is a time of showing gratitude and preparing for challenges to come."
 eordellon.3.winter:0 "Our particular devotion to the Winter as of late has inspired a festival dedicated entirely to the season. Though the elements can make it a challenging prospect, families nevertheless gather together to enjoy each other's company around the warmth of their fires. Gifts are exchanged, and food set aside for the occasion is enjoyed liberally. If the weather is right, some children even go outside to play in the snow. For all the hardship Winter can bring, our people now feel a sense of resilience and closeness no other season can quite provide."
 eordellon.3.eordellon:0 "Our dedication to the balance of the four seasons as of late has inspired a festival dedicated to this very concept. Celebrations often feature a mix of elements, from the flowers of Spring and the jubilation of Summer, to the gratitude of Fall and the reflection of Winter. Feasts, too, are often a mix of the best food each season has to offer. Despite the seemingly eclectic mix of elements and honors, the entire experience becomes one of cohesion, unity, and understanding. Not simply for all four seasons, but for each other."
 eordellon.3.default:0 "Despite the lack of any specific influence over our seasonal thinking as of late, we can always still celebrate. Whatever hardships we may encounter, or whatever bounties we may enjoy, there is always something to take joy in, and always opportunities to join together and make merry. We must never forget that unity comes in many forms, and while they may not all be as distinctive or grand, they are no less important for it."

 eordellon.5.t:0 "The Seasonal Heresies"
 eordellon.5.d.normal:0 "The elves of Eordand follows the fey of the seaonal courts, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Long ago we might have been united in said worship but it isn't the case today, each season having it's own dedicated followers as well as Eordellon preaching about "seasonal balance" or at least what they interpret balance as.\nThis division is also reflected on how the feys deal with us, as none of us are seen as long lasting or important enough for the most powerful among them to consider dealing with us outside of the occasional patronage of specific individuals.\nTo rectify this we'll need to find ways to increase our stances among the fey as well as eliminate the competition."
 eordellon.5.d.convert:0 "We recently changed which court we follow, or stopped following any specific seasons. While our importance among the fey as a whole hasn't diminished, our previous influencers through might need convincing to talk to us again."
 eordellon.5.a:0 "We shall rise above the rest"
 
 eordellon.6.t:0 "Feyscaled Kobolds"
 eordellon.6.d:0 "For several decades now, kobolds have lived in our lands. In that time, their inclination to worship dragons led them to gravitate toward faeries dragons. The faeries dragons have taken this devotion positively, often considering kobolds to be their most favored playmates. Many kobolds have even shed their old cultural identities, now calling themselves feyscaled in honor of their fae patrons. While the impact of this on our nation has been minimal, some see this relationship as a great example of an ideal relationship with the fey."
 eordellon.6.a:0 "At the very least, they're adorable."
 
 eordellon.8.t:0 "The Embassy is Complete"
 eordellon.8.d:0 "Our embassy to the fey is finally complete. Though we have had to make difficult choices and compromises in building it, the embassy now stands as a conduit with which for us to communicate with the fey as necessary. Of course, all those choices have influenced our relationship with the fey, and how we are likely to interact with them in the future. Likewise, our experiences have given us a new understanding and insight of the fey, and put our relationship with them in a new light. The nature of that relationship is"
 eordellon.8.a:0 "One of mutual cooperation and respect"
 eordellon.8.b:0 "One of loyalty and submission to the fey"
 eordellon.8.c:0 "One of indifference and limited influence"
 
 eordellon.9.t:0 "Minor Fey Wants Trinket"
 eordellon.9.d:0 "A basic story is repeating itself as our embassy to the fey continues to completion. Minor fey, such as pixies or nymphs, have taken interest in certain possessions and valuables, demanding that these objects be given over to them. The issue is becoming common enough that a concrete policy for these and future demands ought to be established. What course of action should we take?"
 eordellon.9.a:0 "Just give the fey whatever they ask for"
 eordellon.9.b:0 "Offer them some shiny but useless baubles instead"
 eordellon.9.c:0 "Create standard exchange rates, and have the fey trade for what they want"
 
 eordellon.10.t:0 "Elementals Cause Havoc"
 eordellon.10.d:0 "Elementals, by their very nature, are volatile creatures, prone to causing destruction wherever they go. This is especially true when it comes to elf-made structures, such as our developing embassy and the settlement around it. To see the embassy destroyed while hosting elementals would be bad enough - the damage to the surrounding communities would be even more severe. How should we address this before it becomes a problem?"
 eordellon.10.a:0 "We must ask the elementals to remain outside our settlement"
 eordellon.10.b:0 "Invest in reinforced structures that can withstand the elementals"
 eordellon.10.c:0 "Surely our mages can find a solution, set them to work"
 
 eordellon.11.t:0 "Party time"
 eordellon.11.d:0 "We've recently noticed a marked decrease in progress on the embassy, and indeed on various projects around it. After light investigation, the culprit is simple - some satyrs, nymphs, and dryads have been throwing parties with our workers, stopping any work in its tracks. We need to find a way to deal with this if we want any work to get done at all."
 eordellon.11.a:0 "Send in the authorities to force these layabouts back to work!"
 eordellon.11.b:0 "Just let it happen. The parties will have to end eventually"
 eordellon.11.c:0 "Formalize the arrangement with mandatory party times for workers"
 
 eordellon.12.t:0 "Fey Demands Special Treatment"
 eordellon.12.desc:0 "A fey identifying itself as a very important individual has been making ridiculous demands on our developing embassy as of late. Special accommodations, lavish parties, personal servants, and the list goes on. While these demands aren't beyond our ability to grant, it would be an expense all the same, and one we may be unwilling to pay. But of course, to displease a fey is a dangerous thing... What should we do?"
 eordellon.12.a:0 "Just appease them, we don't need any trouble"
 eordellon.12.b:0 "Give them nothing!"
 eordellon.12.c:0 "Some magic should put them in their place"
 eordellon.12.d:0 "We serve an archfey, appeal to them for help!"
 
 eordellon.13.t:0 "The Old Man of the Archive Comes to Visit"
 eordellon.13.d:0 "Our ongoing embassy construction has caught the attention of the Old Man of the Archive, an archfey with particular respect among followers of the Spring Court. His interest is more than simple curiosity, however - he has asked us for books, as well as an allotted space for him to conduct his work. This is hardly surprising, considering he represents much in the way of knowledge and learning, particularly for those who look to the past for wisdom and knowledge.\n\nThe Old Man simply cannot be denied out of hand, lest we incur the wrath of an archfey and his followers. Furthermore, pleasing him could bring us great benefits indeed - if we are prepared to shoulder the expense. How should we go about fulfilling his request?"
 eordellon.13.a:0 "Expand our libraries and grant full access to him and his followers"
 eordellon.13.b:0 "Allow him access to any book within our borders"
 eordellon.13.c:0 "Just buy some books for him and be done with it"
 
 eordellon.14.t:0 "The Kraken Seeks Companionship"
 eordellon.14.d:0 "With the work on our embassy proceeding well, we have gained the attention of the Kraken, an archfey looked upon with particular favor by followers of the Summer Court. They have requested access to our embassy so that they may interact with all those who might go through its halls. This would be a trivial request to grant, were it not for one issue - the Kraken is bound to water, and our embassy is on land.\n\nOf course, we cannot simply reject the Kraken's request. They are, after all, an archfey, and well respected among the Summer Court faithful. The question is, how are we to go about satisfying them?"
 eordellon.14.a:0 "Expand the nearby ports and link our embassy to them"
 eordellon.14.b:0 "Have a detachment of mages attend to the Kraken's needs"
 eordellon.14.c:0 "Build a series of canals so all aquatic fey may come to visit!"
 
 eordellon.15.t:0 "The Gloam Knight Wants a Duel"
 eordellon.15.d:0 "Our work on the embassy has earned the attention of the Gloam Knight, an archfey who has taken up the cause of the Autumn Court and seeks to right wrongs in general. Fortunately, they have no quarrel with us - they simply wish for a compelling duel to test our might. There are a few ways we could grant this request, of course, and the Gloam Knight does not seem particularly picky.\n\nThat being said, they cannot simply be ignored, either. To do so would be an immense disrespect, and no doubt cause more problems than a duel is worth. At the same time, appeasing the Gloam Knight could earn their favor, especially if we give them a good fight. How should we approach this?"
 eordellon.15.a:0 "I shall duel them myself!"
 eordellon.15.b:0 "Set aside a space in the embassy for tournaments"
 eordellon.15.c:0 "Grant them an academy to train aspiring duelists"
 
 eordellon.16.t:0 "The Midwinter Chef Asks For Hospitality"
 eordellon.16.d:0 "As our embassy continues onward to completion, it has gained us the interest of the Midwinter Chef, an archfey with special respect among followers of the Winter Court. He has expressed satisfaction with the idea of our embassy, and has asked us to hold a grand feast to make everyone feel welcome. He has offered some help with the food preparation, but the overall task of arranging the feast is to fall upon us.\n\nOf course, this is not simply a polite suggestion, and to deny the Midwinter Chef would be incredibly unwise. Likewise, to please him with our hospitality could have him look favorably upon us. How should we approach conducting this feast?"
 eordellon.16.a:0 "Buy the most luxurious foods we can afford!"
 eordellon.16.b:0 "Buy as much food as we can so everyone can eat their fill"
 eordellon.16.c:0 "Perhaps the Midwinter Chef can help preserve our food for a longer feast?"
 
 eordellon.17.t:0 "The Unthroned Queen Arrives"
 eordellon.17.pelomar:0 "Our developing embassy has received a most auspicious visitor. The Unthroned Queen, sovereign of the Dromandrod, archfey, and patron of our realm, has appeared to grace us with her presence. Yet she does not simply come to view the embassy, as she has made clear. Indeed, she has asked pointedly as to our progress on unifying Eordand under our rule.\n\nIt is by her mandate that we are sworn to uphold the seasonal balance, and by her grace that we have the right to all of Eordand. But that does not mean we haven't had to struggle to assert that authority. With the attention of her majesty on us so directly, we may expect some boon if our progress pleases her. That being said, if we've been wanting in our goal, her appearance is sure to motivate our realm at every level to renew their efforts. What do we have to tell her?"
 eordellon.17.notpelomar:0 "Our developing embassy has received a most auspicious visitor. The Unthroned Queen, sovereign of the Dromandrod, archfey, and patron of Pelomar, has appeared to grace us with her presence. However, her visit comes with a purpose, and one some in our realm may find inconvenient. She has demanded we bend the knee to Pelomar and recognize once and for all their authority over all of Eordand.\n\nOf course, we can always refuse this demand, even at the risk of offending a great ally to the Peitar people. Some of our advisors have even suggested that the Unthroned Queen may be persuaded to allow us to usurp Pelomar's place, if we've managed to demonstrate our superiority over them by this point. What should our answer be?"
 eordellon.17.newclaiment:0 "Our developing embassy has received a most auspicious visitor. The Unthroned Queen, sovereign of the Dromandrod, archfey, and patron of Pelomar, has appeared to grace us with her presence. Despite making several oblique and chastising comments on our destruction of Pelomar, including a congratulation for "boldly redefining what it means to swear an oath," she does not seem to have come to punish us. Indeed, she has asked how well we have been progressing in fulfilling Pelomar's mandate to unify Eordand.\n\nThose of us who can swallow our pride and see beyond the light mockery see this for what it truly is. The Unthroned Queen has invested us with Pelomar's mission to unify and rule Eordand, with all the responsibility that entails. Of course, with great responsibility can come great power. Even if we are still struggling to achieve that dream, our newfound mandate would likely inspire great fervor among our people. What shall we have to report to her?"
 eordellon.17.a:0 "We shall submit to Pelomar, your majesty."
 eordellon.17.b:0 "Pelomar has failed. We shall take their place."
 eordellon.17.c:0 "We are progressing well, your majesty."
 eordellon.17.d:0 "It is... Not as smooth as we would like."
 eordellon.17.e:0 "It has already been achieved."
 
 eordellon.18.t:0 "Faerie Dragon Mischief"
 eordellon.18.d:0 "Despite their superficially cute appearances, faeries dragons can be quite dangerous. They're prone to mischief, and are surprisingly strong. While this has yet to result in serious problems for us, some parents have begun to complain about faerie dragon activity. Specifically, these parents believe their children are being negatively influenced by the faeries dragons, and may even be put into danger by them. We've received enough complaints that it at least warrants a response. Of course, being fae, to simply deny the faeries dragons playmates would be very unwise. What should we do instead?"
 eordellon.18.a:0 "Why not invite some kobolds to play with them?"
 eordellon.18.b:0 "They're only playing, tell the parents to calm down"
 eordellon.18.c:0 "Assign servants to entertain the faerie dragons instead"
 
 eordellon.19.t:0 "Hags Arrive at the Embassy"
 eordellon.19.desc:0 "While many fey are capricious creatures at best, they are often easy enough to understand and mollify. This is rarely so with hags. They are both incredibly powerful and prone to malicious behavior, and can be attributed to causing many personal woes across Eordand. Unfortunately, it seems a group of hags have taken notice of our budding embassy, and have arrived demanding recognition and respect. A response is needed, before they cause severe problems for us and our people."
 eordellon.19.a:0 "Send in the army to drive them away"
 eordellon.19.b:0 "I'll force them away myself"
 eordellon.19.c:0 "Have our mages drive them off"
 eordellon.19.d:0 "Negotiate with the more reasonable hags among them"
 eordellon.19.e:0 "Welcome them, of course!"
 
 eordellon.22.t:0 "The Hags take their dues"
 eordellon.22.d:0 "Ten years ago we have made a pact with Hags, a decision that might seem foolish in retrospect, while we gain great strengh a price must be paid and while we could have done this earlier they seemed to have come to collect by themselves, whether we like it or not."
