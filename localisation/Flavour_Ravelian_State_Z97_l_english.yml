 Z97_ravelianism_in_anbennar_title:0 "Ravelianism in Anbennar"
 Z97_ravelianism_in_anbennar_desc:0 "Ravelianism has successfully caught on in the Empire, but it will need Anbennar to become a solid foundation from which the rest of Cannor can be converted. "
 Z97_ravelianism_in_cannor_title:0 "Ravelianism in Cannor"
 Z97_ravelianism_in_cannor_desc:0 "As a faith that actively seeks to address the inadequacies of other Cannorian Faiths, it is nigh embarrassing that we aren't the dominant religion of our Continent. We should remedy that. "
 Z97_foothold_in_aelantir_title:0 "Foothold in Aelantir"
 Z97_foothold_in_aelantir_desc:0 "The original home of the God Fragment, Aelantir is likely to hold other wonders that could change the way we understand our universe. We need to begin spreading our influence there. "
 Z97_debate_4_buildup_1_title:0 "Nature of the God Fragment"
 Z97_debate_4_buildup_1_desc:0 "As an artifact of the Precursor Empire, the God Fragment cannot be fully understood until we get a better grasp of the Precursors as a whole. By overseeing a handful of thorough excavations into precursor ruins, we hope to come closer to understanding God. "
 Z97_slap_gommo_haless_title:0 "Beat Gommo: Haless"
 Z97_slap_gommo_haless_desc:0 "Now that the Ravelian Faith has come to depend on the spread and control of artifice, we have unfortunately been drawn into a rivalry with the Gommo, an artifice organization that has set up branches all the way in Haless. They must be brought to heel. "
 Z97_interplanar_forays_title:0 "Interplanar Forays"
 Z97_interplanar_forays_desc:0 "Although our understanding of the afterlife has always been limited, there is research we can do to elucidate some aspects, although it is incredibly dangerous. Our adventurers will take on the holy charge of summoning a variety of angels, demons, and red reapers, forcing them to answer cosmological and thanatological questions. From there, our scholars hope to assemble a greater truth about our existence. "
 Z97_interplanar_forays_effect_inf:0 "Interplanar Forays: §Y+10.0%§!"
 Z97_debate_2_buildup_title:0 "Mix Scholars with the parish"
 Z97_debate_2_buildup_desc:0 "As the previous debate has shown, our faith is broadly split into two camps: The erudites, who are partial to our faith's academic beginnings, and the Zealots, who see our religion as, well, a religion. Lest the Ravelian Faith splinter in her infancy, we should ensure these two camps interact with each other. "
 Z97_debate_3_buildup_1_title:0 "International Faiths"
 Z97_debate_3_buildup_1_desc:0 "If we hope to spread our faith to farther lands, we will need to research the local religions of those lands. Only then can we assemble convincing proof that their gods are but products or facets of the one True God"
 Z97_debate_4_buildup_2_title:0 "Nature of Magic"
 Z97_debate_4_buildup_2_desc:0 "Although we've become rather adept at employing magic in various artificer inventions, we still do not understand it on a fundamental level. By cross-referencing the knowledge of classically trained Cannorian Mages, the Bardic Magic of Seinathíl, and the craftsmanship of Dwarven runesmiths, hopefully we can begin drawing some conclusions about this fundamental force that makes our world function. "
 Z97_importance_of_artifice_title:0 "Importance of Artifice"
 Z97_importance_of_artifice_desc:0 "The fourth, and God-willing last, debate is over. The importance of artifice in our world cannot be overstated. It should be a national priority that we reign in every Artificer of our faith, to ensure God's magic is being used to advance our national interests. "
 Z97_slap_gommo_bulwar_title:0 "Beat Gommo: Bulwar"
 Z97_slap_gommo_bulwar_desc:0 "Now that the Ravelian Faith has come to depend on the spread and control of artifice, we have unfortunately been drawn into a rivalry with the Gommo, an artifice organization that has set up branches all the way in Bulwar. They must be brought to heel. "
 Z97_artifice_capital_halann_title:0 "Artifice Capital of Halann"
 Z97_artifice_capital_halann_desc:0 "Even secular artificers make 'pilgrimages' to Aranthíl, and for good reason. We host the brightest minds and the most advanced research facilities. As Halann's expectations of Aranthíl grow, we must rise to meet them."
 Z97_global_control_of_artifice_title:0 "Global Control of Artifice"
 Z97_global_control_of_artifice_desc:0 "The Ravelian Church has a hand in dozens of courts, advising nations on both matters of theology and the artifice industry. We should continue to expand our influence across Halann!"
 Z97_take_aranthil_title:0 "Take Aranthíl"
 Z97_take_aranthil_desc:0 "A historic Castanorian fort, Aranthíl is where the Empire of Anbennar was founded, and functioned as its capital for twenty years before Anbenncost assumed that role. It also happens to lie on the Luna River, a region already under heavy Ravelian Influence. It is the perfect capital for our new religion. "
 Z97_urbanize_luna_title:0 "Urbanize the Luna"
 Z97_urbanize_luna_desc:0 "The Luna is already a natural hotspot for Ravelian thinkers, but if we properly invest in this area, it would be a generous gesture. Providing a polished haven for high-ranking clergy of other Ravelian nations would surely grant us diplomatic benefits. "
 Z97_debate_3_buildup_2_title:0 "Research Regent Court"
 Z97_debate_3_buildup_2_desc:0 "§GThis mission accepts province occupation, not just ownership!§!\nAlthough the bulk of Ravelian doctrine is synthesized from Regent Court theology, the truth is, we could still learn more about Regent Court figures. If we could access the wisdom and knowledge of the Great Temples, it would surely bolster our faith. "
 Z97_heal_the_schism_title:0 "Heal the Schism"
 Z97_heal_the_schism_desc:0 "The Adeanics and the Corinites have caused incalculable bloodshed for gods they held to be real. If our Scholars can undermine both sides with proof of the One True God, Cannor might find peace."
 Z97_religious_capital_eoa_title:0 "Religious Capital of EoA"
 Z97_religious_capital_eoa_desc:0 "Across Anbennar, millions of people look to the Rector for guidance, often coming to Aranthíl for pilgrimmage. We must both ensure that Aranthíl exceeds their expectations, and see that all members of our faith are guaranteed from outside invaders."
 Z97_draft_more_internationals_title:0 "Draft more internationals"
 Z97_draft_more_internationals_desc:0 "The initial recruitment drives have proven beneficial. We should scale up the operation, and even start recruiting more soldiers during our Symposiums!"
 Z97_fate_of_the_magisters_title:0 "Fate of the Magisters"
 Z97_fate_of_the_magisters_desc:0 "There can be only one authority over God's Gift"
 Z97_fate_of_the_magisters_effect_loy:0 "Fate of the Magisters"
 Z97_fate_of_the_magisters_effect_inf:0 "Fate of the Magisters: §Y+10.0%§!"
 Z97_artifice_capital_of_cannor_title:0 "Artifice Capital: Cannor"
 Z97_artifice_capital_of_cannor_desc:0 "The Sina Lans family has been a longstanding supporter of Ravelian Artifice, and they've decided to help sponsor the largest center for education and research ever seen: The Sina Lans Innovation Center (SLIC). To ensure attendance by Cannor's best and brightest, we need to oversee the artificers of as many Cannorian nations as possible. "
 Z97_slic_reserve_corps_title:0 "SLIC Reserve Corps"
 Z97_slic_reserve_corps_desc:0 "The Sina Lans Innovation Center provides humanitarian technology, but we need to use artifice to improve our military as well."
 Z97_restore_old_imperial_court_title:0 "Restore the old Imperial Court"
 Z97_restore_old_imperial_court_desc:0 "Aranthíl is still a fragment of its full potential. We should update the old fortifications to modern standards, as well as create a housing for a cameral government with plenty of room to expand as our faith does. "
 Z97_begin_drafting_internationals_title:0 "Begin Drafting Internationals"
 Z97_begin_drafting_internationals_desc:0 "Conscripting our own citizens isn't going to afford us the army the faith needs to carry out her crusade against the ignorant. Fortunately, we have a rapport with our brothers in the faith, and they would be willing to contribute some men to our army- provided we pay for the requisite infrastructure. "
 Z97_orda_aldresia_repurposed_title:0 "Orda Aldresia, Repurposed"
 Z97_orda_aldresia_repurposed_desc:0 "Orda Aldresia, once the Knightly Order responsible for defending the Emperor of Anbennar, has been without clear direction following the greentide, and the religious wars. If we grant them God's wonders of Artifice, they would surely leap at the opportunity to serve a higher purpose once more."
 Z97_capital_of_faith_halann_title:0 "Capital of Global Faith"
 Z97_capital_of_faith_halann_desc:0 "The Ravelian Faith has proven itself to be the strongest and most widespread religion on Halann. Aranthíl, however, does not reflect this strength. With some further investment, we can establish ourselves as the most dominant member of the most dominant religion. "
 Z97_one_faith_title:0 "One Faith"
 Z97_one_faith_desc:0 "As every sentient being on Halann comes to worship the True God, the Rector tells us its power and glory has appreciably increased. "
 Z97_enact_ravelian_technocracy_title:0 "Enact Ravelian Technocracy"
 Z97_enact_ravelian_technocracy_desc:0 "Artifice has become a necessity for any modern state, and for us doubly so. We should integrate the brightest of these engineers into our government, to ensure that the holy act of artifice is developed as much as possible"
