 jaddari_mounted_legionaries_title:0 "Mounted Legionaries"
 jaddari_mounted_legionaries_desc:0 "Our armies have gone through many developments since the return of the Phoenix Legions to Bulwar and their eventual settlement in the far Salahad. Far advanced from Jaher's great charges, our new methods of mounted combat and hit and run tactics have proven very effective.\n\nWe should double down on this innovation and transform our armies to be fully mounted — only then will we be prepared for the crusade to come."
 jaddari_deal_with_the_xhazobkult_title:0 "Deal with the Xhazobkult"
 jaddari_deal_with_the_xhazobkult_desc:0 "The duties of Surael are our own, and no duty has more import than His commandment to fight against the darkness. It is clear there is no greater encroaching darkness than the demonic worship of the Xhazobkult. We must destroy it and break its power over the gnolls."
 jaddari_enlighten_the_gnoll_title:0 "Enlighten the Gnolls"
 jaddari_enlighten_the_gnoll_desc:0 "The gnolls close to our home have been brought into the light. However there are still many that live in Bulwar that follow the Xhazobkult. A great start has been made, but let us spread the truth to all gnolls, that they might find meaning and redemption in Surael's embrace."
 jaddari_the_western_harpies_title:0 "The Western Harpies"
 jaddari_the_western_harpies_desc:0 "While the Siadúnan harpies in the east are sociable and capable of reasonable dealings, the harpies in the west are said to be much more difficult. We will first take their land and bring them into the Jadd and after that we'll see what their purpose is in Surael's crusade."
 jaddari_birsantanses_kneels_title:0 "Birzartanšes Kneels"
 jaddari_birsantanses_kneels_desc:0 "The Harpy Hills are an area that is exceedingly difficult to control. And while they are our enemy, Birzartanšes has historically done a good job of managing the rough terrain. It is clear that Surael has chosen that to be their purpose in His crusade; let us subjugate them that we can make use of their experience."
 jaddari_up_to_ovdal_tungr_title:0 "Up to Ovdal Tûngr"
 jaddari_up_to_ovdal_tungr_desc:0 "Bahar is the great access to Cannor, and the great gate of Bahar is the hold of the Copper Dwarves. But since the Decades of Devastation the region is a mess. We must bring order and light to this chaotic region. Dwarf, human, elf and goblin will live in harmony under the sun of Surael, and under our rule."
 jaddari_the_subjugation_of_reuyel_title:0 "Subjugating Re-Uyel"
 jaddari_the_subjugation_of_reuyel_desc:0 "The Republic of Re-Uyel was one of the few of those under the sway of the Sun Elves to throw off their shackles and stand up to their lies. We have since greatly admired their conviction and we must integrate that spirit into our realm. We deeply need those who see the sun clearly to spread the light of Surael."
 jaddari_the_ports_of_businor_title:0 "The Ports of Businor"
 jaddari_the_ports_of_businor_desc:0 "The Divenhal is a great sea and we have found our navies and shipyards sadly lacking. If we manage to seize the ports of Businor we will be able to ensure total control over the eastern portion of this great inland sea and build up a navy so that no one can contest it."
 jaddari_prepare_suraels_armada_title:0 "Surael's Armada"
 jaddari_prepare_suraels_armada_desc:0 "Under Jaher, under Jexis, under Jaddar, the legions marched. But as we look towards the setting sun, it is clear now they must float. Every shipyard in Bulwar and Businor must be devoted to the construction of Surael's Armada to ensure His light, and our rule, stretches far across the sea."
 jaddari_the_suns_sea_title:0 "The Sun's Sea"
 jaddari_the_suns_sea_desc:0 "The Armada is ready. Wood from the Raheni jungles has been worked by Copper Dwarven craftsmen into creations that honour Surael with their very being. But His purpose demands more, and it is time for the Desert Elves to set forth into the waters, and begin to claim the sea as Surael's own."
 jaddari_the_dames_neck_title:0 "The Dame's Neck"
 jaddari_the_dames_neck_desc:0 "The Dame is one of many Gods the Cannorian Heathens believed in, but who in truth perished millennia ago. Her embodiment in the lasting Cannorian perception of their inland sea is thus a morbid funereal mask. A sad relic of a sad collection of beliefs; we must seize the entrance to the Dameshead, and ensure the sea's legacy — and wealth — do not keep the surrounding peoples from embracing Surael's light."
 jaddari_regain_anbenncost_title:0 "Regain Anbenncóst"
 jaddari_regain_anbenncost_desc:0 "During the Decade of Masks, the Empress Jexis ruled the Phoenix Empire from Anbenncóst. The Burned Empress led her father's empire to its vastest expanse, and fought wars both overt and covert against her rival to the west, Ioriel. It was not until her assassination in 1161 AA that the Empire fell, and Anbenncóst was lost.\n\nWe do not fight our wars in the shadows, we wage Surael's crusade under the light of His bright sun. But despite these differences, Jaddar was Jexis's heir, and so is the Jadd Empire. Anbenncóst is our birthright, and we must make that clear to those who claim it now."
 jaddari_the_heart_of_cannor_title:0 "The Heart of Cannor"
 jaddari_the_heart_of_cannor_desc:0 "'What is the purpose of a body's heart, if it lacks a soul?' It is an important question, especially when examining the Dameshead, the heart of West Cannor. While the states here may lay content with their wealth and prosperity, it all lacks meaning if not directed towards Surael's purpose. We must enlighten them all to this truth."
 jaddari_unity_under_the_jadd_title:0 "Unity Under the Jadd"
 jaddari_unity_under_the_jadd_desc:0 "For centuries, the Cannorians have sought unity. At the Grand Summit of Aranthíl, they thought it could be achieved by a mage-ruled peace. After the Wars of Rule, they thought it could be upheld by an elected Emperor. Even the chaos of the Lilac Wars failed to dissuade them of this notion.\n\nFor all their struggling was in vain. True unity can only be achieved under Surael's light, by following the tenets of the Jadd. Now, finally, may they know unity."
 jaddari_anbennarian_administration_title:0 "Anbennarian Administration"
 jaddari_anbennarian_administration_desc:0 "While Anbennar has finally been unified into one state under our rule, the region's diversity was its strength, and we should not forget that fact. In Anbenncóst, Surael's sun now shines above a city which seems a microcosm of Halann entire. We should ensure our entire Empire follows a similar model, every person and people united in labour and embodying Surael's glory."
 jaddari_summon_the_legionaries_title:0 "Summon the Legionaries"
 jaddari_summon_the_legionaries_desc:0 "It is time to start the great campaign. The Sun Elves in Bulwar have not fulfilled their duties to Surael and they have let the Xhazobkult profane an appallingly large swath of land. Someone more capable must take over and right these wrongs. Let Jaddar call the legions together — it is time to take Bulwar's fate into our own hands."
 jaddari_seize_azka_sur_title:0 "Seize Azka-Sur"
 jaddari_seize_azka_sur_desc:0 "Azka-Sur, the fortress of the sun, is the furthest eastwards bastion of the Cult. It will serve as an example of our dominance over the Cult and the starting point for the spread of Surael's truths as revealed to Jaddar. Its fertile lands can also make for a good base to build our empire upon."
 jaddari_upper_suran_plain_title:0 "The Upper Suran Plain"
 jaddari_upper_suran_plain_desc:0 "The Suran is the most important river of Bulwar. By capturing the upper plains we can start to reap the benefits of cultivatable land. It is also the first step in the conquest of the entire region. The breach will set us up for the conquest of the rest of Bulwar and the formation of a new Phoenix Empire."
 jaddari_the_heart_of_bulwar_title:0 "The Heart of Bulwar"
 jaddari_the_heart_of_bulwar_desc:0 "The entire region is named after this single city: Bulwar. In truth, the metropolis has seen better days and has now been overtaken by Brasan as mercantile center of the region. But it remains the heart of the culture. It remains the heart of the religion. And when we control it? Well, we have the entire region by its heart."
 jaddari_lower_suran_plain_title:0 "The Lower Suran Plain"
 jaddari_lower_suran_plain_desc:0 "Just as the Suran flows unceasing towards the Divenhal, so too do our armies march unceasing in pursuit of Surael's glory. And so we must march onward, following the Suran to the sea, and ensuring all alongside it see the light and truth of Jadd."
 jaddari_the_suran_delta_title:0 "The Suran Delta"
 jaddari_the_suran_delta_desc:0 "We hold most of the Suran in our grasp, but one essential part is still missing. In the delta sits the city of Brasan, the largest in Bulwar. With Brasan we have total dominance over the lifeblood of Bulwar (along with some sugar from the nearby marshes, to sweeten our grasp). We will hold the Suran from source to sea and we will be the undisputed power in Bulwar."
 jaddari_the_salahad_gate_title:0 "The Salahad Gate"
 jaddari_the_salahad_gate_desc:0 "Bulwar is a fortress for one who holds all of it. The Serpentspine guards its northern front and the Salahad its south and east. To the west is the Divenhal sea. These gates guard narrow passes, and the few caravan paths that lead out and in. Holding those will allow total control of the entry and exit into and out of Bulwar. We need to seize the Salahad Gate to fully secure that flank."
 jaddari_the_conquest_of_elizna_title:0 "The Conquest of Elizna"
 jaddari_the_conquest_of_elizna_desc:0 "It was the Ketarch Baqtkhet I who, in his wisdom, gave the Isle of Elizna as a gift to Jaher. Unfortunately, the current rulers of Elizna do not have a similar level of insight, even though our charisma and ambition dwarf that demonstrated by Jaher. Furthermore, as Jaddar was the son of Jexis, Elizna is ours by birthright as well. If we must use force of arms to make this clear, so be it."
 jaddari_light_for_kheterata_title:0 "A Light for Kheterata"
 jaddari_light_for_kheterata_desc:0 "Kheterata is surrounded by the Xhazobkult on all sides. It is a darkness that constantly threatens to overwhelm them. Sadly they do not have the light of the Sun to guide them. Let us bring them into the Jadd so that they might form a bastion against the darkness, and so Surael can form a bastion for their souls."
 jaddari_save_ekha_title:0 "Save Ekha"
 jaddari_save_ekha_desc:0 "Ekha has been long besieged by a darkness which takes Gnollish form. But Surael's purpose, and the purpose of the state who embodies His cause, is to burn away that darkness and show the light. We are thus called by duty and nature to save the inhabitants of Ekha, and must make haste to do so."
 jaddari_the_dostanorian_buffer_title:0 "A Buffer in Dostanor"
 jaddari_the_dostanorian_buffer_desc:0 "Castan's Empire long ago saw the utility of the Dostanor region as a bulwark against the looming Deepwoods to the east. The fortifications they built in their March are ancient, and their utility has stood the test of time. As we begin our conquest of Cannor, we would do well to follow their example and ensure a secure and defensible buffer in the region."
 jaddari_dappled_sunlight_title:0 "Dappled Sunlight"
 jaddari_dappled_sunlight_desc:0 "The light that shines down on the Deepwoods is that of Surael's sun, which casts its light across all Halann. But the light that reaches the forest floor? What little penetrates the abyss-dark leaves and gnarled branches? It lacks His warmth. Indeed, some theologians speculate it is not His at all, but an otherworldly light cast from some separate realm.\n\nThis cannot stand. The Gladeways that offer a foreboding entrance, and the glades we know lay beyond, may be as perilous as the harshest dunes of the Salahad or the deepest jungle of Rahen. But our Surael-given purpose is to bring His light to the darkest places, and these woods are no exception."
 jaddari_the_drink_of_the_gods_title:0 "The Drink of the Gods"
 jaddari_the_drink_of_the_gods_desc:0 "Inside a desert-worn tent, its coolness a balm against the heat outside. To toast our alliance with the Ghankedheni. When receiving the highest Cannorian dignitaries in one of our many throne rooms. For centuries, a bottle of Jaherian Sunlight wine has been the ultimate in alcoholic succour, even as we have risen from Desert Legion to Empire.\n\nBut amongst the many wares of the traders that cross the Divenhal we have found bottles in a new style, that contain beverages which are as light and radiant as Surael's own grace, from the rich Madalairey White to the indulgent rare vintages of Rubenaire Red. And if we could bring the Sun Elven winemakers that have spent centuries honing their craft samples of these foreign soils and cultivars, perhaps their creations will rival the drinks of Surael himself."
 jaddari_the_sunset_isle_title:0 "The Sunset Isle"
 jaddari_the_sunset_isle_desc:0 "It is said that every night he spent atop a desert dune, Jaddar would look west to track the setting of the sun. Once it had fully fallen below the horizon, before retiring to sleep or to the care of Jasiéne, he would unstring and restring his bow, readying himself anew for his, and Surael's, crusade against the darkness.\n\nFinally, the very point where the sun falls into the sea, the furthest edge of the horizon, is within our grasp. Let us seize it now, and with it, see Jaddar's dreams fulfilled."
 jaddari_the_sunset_temple_title:0 "The Sunset Temple"
 jaddari_the_sunset_temple_desc:0 "At the very western edge of Venáil, the first piece of Cannor that graced Elven eyes after the Remnant Fleet wandered at sea, we shall build a temple. For our great work here shall mark the end of another era of wandering, the purposeless and meaningless striving of so many people who toiled without consideration of their purpose under Surael, and in His fight.\n\nNow that they are part of The Jadd, that is all behind them. Let Elf, Dwarf, Harimari, Human, and so many more all make their way to the Sunset Temple, to watch Surael's light go down. And, just as for Jaddar so many years ago, in seeing it may they all be renewed in their commitment to His crusade against the darkness."
 jaddari_the_western_beacon_title:0 "The Western Beacon"
 jaddari_the_western_beacon_desc:0 "Our Empire now straddles Halcann. But every person within it might find themself drawn to a different corner thereof, from the old temple complex in Bulwar, to the Mountain of Clear Sight, to newborn Jaddanzar, to the vast palaces of Rahen, and to so many more. Even if they never set foot outside the town they were born, these vast edifices are as much markers of our rule as the sun is of Surael's.\n\nOn Adráil, heathens erected a tower to their own vanity, their endless, meaningless, quests devoid of any understanding of their purpose under Surael. Let us repurpose it into a beacon for all in Cannor, to eternally remind them of their inclusion amongst The Jadd."
 jaddari_the_evening_sun_title:0 "The Evening Sun"
 jaddari_the_evening_sun_desc:0 "Cannor. A land of empires and kingdoms, and of the duchies and free cities that rivalled them. A land of small races, and those that subjugated them. A land that worshipped a court of corpses, a woman twice the same, or a box that never even began to live. A land of wine, tobacco, luscious wheat and gilded glass. A land of strife, and of unity.\n\nAnd now, finally, a land of the Jadd."
 jaddari_one_bright_god_title:0 "One Bright God"
 jaddari_one_bright_god_desc:0 "The Cannorians spent millennia believing in dead gods. Even when one of those deaths was made too obvious to ignore, they turned to a heroine, ignoring the reality of her corpse. In recent years, they even began to pray to a box. A box!\n\nThankfully, the days of having to worry about those absurdities are gone. Surael is the only God who survived the Day of Ashen Skies, and all Cannor now recognizes that truth. He is one god, indivisible, bright in the heavens and in all our hearts."
 jaddari_the_setting_sun_title:0 "The Setting Sun"
 jaddari_the_setting_sun_desc:0 "There is no sight in nature more beautiful than the setting sun. It can be a golden orb, purer than any king's, falling into the water. It can paint colours more resplendent than any Viswall dye, than any Esmari fashionista. It is art, it is wonder, it is a true sign of Surael's blessing each and every day.\n\nAnd so too, now, is our rule over Cannor. From the shining spires of Anbenncóst to the verdant vineyards of the Winebay, Cannor has — finally — achieved the unity they so long sought. Unity under the Jadd."
 jaddari_a_homeland_for_the_jadd_title:0 "A Homeland for the Jadd"
 jaddari_a_homeland_for_the_jadd_desc:0 "Our young religion is spreading fast, but our lands are wide and empty. Too much earth, though blessed by Surael's light, yet ignores His blessings. We must spread Jaddar's truth to new lands and create a true homeland for our religion."
 jaddari_build_a_grand_temple_title:0 "Build a Grand Temple"
 jaddari_build_a_grand_temple_desc:0 "Other religions have great temples, which serve as monuments to their gods' glory and their religious zeal. It is time to claim our position and to show the world that we are no passing heresy. Azka-Sur will come to house the greatest monument of the Jadd. The temple's steeples will glitter gold and its domes and halls will leave no one to doubt that we are the only true faith."
 jaddari_spread_the_faith_title:0 "Spread the Faith"
 jaddari_spread_the_faith_desc:0 "The Jadd has been established. But too many still do not contribute to the fight against the darkness. We shall convince them by word and by spear, and spread the truth to the rest of the world. The darkness shall be banished and Surael will be able to return."
 jaddari_reform_the_cult_title:0 "Reform the Cult"
 jaddari_reform_the_cult_desc:0 "We hold Bulwar, the heart of the Cult, and with that we hold their high priests. It is the perfect time to convince them of the truth of the Jadd and to have them amend their proclamation that the Sun Elves are the rightful successors of Surael. Surely they will understand that all followers of the truth are the successors of Surael?"
 jaddari_permanent_pilgrimages_title:0 "Permanent Pilgrimages"
 jaddari_permanent_pilgrimages_desc:0 "With the Jadd Empire now established, many of our subjects have never felt the scorch of the desert sun or the shifting of sand under their boots. We should establish a system of caravanserai and temples such that pilgrims from across our realm might return to the Mountain of Clear Sight and the Grand Temple at Azka-Sur, and stand in the places where Surael's light first lit up the Jaddari."
 jaddari_eduz_jadd_title:0 "Eduz-Jadd"
 jaddari_eduz_jadd_desc:0 "The Great Temple at Azka-Sur was one of our first monuments to the truth of the Jadd and the glory of Surael, and it remains a bright jewel among our crown. However, with the establishment of permanent caravan routes and an ever-increasing flow of pilgrims along them, there is a crush of people in Azka-Sur that the city and temple simply was not built for. While the Mountain of Clear Sight has lasting infrastructure as our long-time capital, the Temple at Azka-Sur will require a full refurbishment and expansion. But the sun spreads its rays unceasingly, and so too must the Great Temple now grow — or, as it now will be known, Azka-Jadd."
 jaddari_the_blessed_river_title:0 "The Blessed River"
 jaddari_the_blessed_river_desc:0 "In our days in the Salahad, the Desert Elves learned the value of always having a water source, and some of Jaddar's first sermons were delivered at the side of an Oasis. It is thus not surprising that freshwater bodies have always seemed somehow blessed by Surael: the way it sparkles in the sunlight, and the way it refuels the body as Surael refuels the soul. And nowhere is more blessed than the Suran River, which feeds and nourishes all Bulwar."
 jaddari_the_founding_of_jaddanzar_title:0 "The Founding of Jaddanzar"
 jaddari_the_founding_of_jaddanzar_desc:0 "Once, Sareyand was a rival, a central bastion of the false Sun Cult belief. Once, they even dared attack us when we were celebrating our victory over the gnoll, threatening to dim our light just when it was first coming into view. But that is all in the past, and we have risen to a level far beyond them, or even the Phoenix Empire they dreamed of restoring.\n\nSo too should we leave behind the past of Sareyand province. It is time to replace the aged palace complex with a city open to all. It is time to construct a testament to glory of the Jadd and the wonder of Surael. It is time to build Jaddanzar."
 jaddari_the_suraelic_guard_title:0 "The Suraelic Guard"
 jaddari_the_suraelic_guard_desc:0 "Of the troops that stand the Heralds Wall, a few have eyes that can see sun glinting off metal from miles away. Of the officers that graduate the Jaddanzar Academy, a few have a strategic mind that would have rivalled Jaddar's own. Of the soldiers that garrison in the Suraelic Barracks, a few wield the blade as if they were born to it — and perhaps they were.\n\nWe must gather all such as these, for Surael has clearly chosen them for a special purpose. They shall form the Suraelic Guard, an elite regiment at the Herald's disposition. May they burn as bright as Surael's sun forevermore."
 jaddari_surael_and_the_khet_title:0 "Surael and the Khet"
 jaddari_surael_and_the_khet_desc:0 "Theologians have long argued: what is the purpose of the Khet in Surael's crusade? Some believe their idleness is clear evidence of their desertion from His cause; they have the capacity for great action but do little. Others ponder whether desisting from action is actually the best action for them to take, to leave the rest of us the struggle that will enlighten our souls.\n\nNow that we rule Kheterata, we can show these beings the truth of Jadd, and see which side they come down on."
 jaddari_an_expedition_across_the_lament_title:0 "Across the Lament"
 jaddari_an_expedition_across_the_lament_desc:0 "Uelos' Lament is a sea that hearkens back to the oldest memories of the Desert Elves. There are still those amongst us who remember their fathers or their fathers' fathers telling stories of those perilous, ruinous, tragic days as part of the remnant fleet. It scarcely seemed imaginable, when all around us was a sea of sand.\n\nBut now we have reached those waters, and Surael calls us beyond. While there is so much of Halcann still laying in shadow, we cannot ignore the Ruinborn to the west, nor all those who have crossed the sea since Edrallian's discovery. We shall prepare a great fleet, the newest ships from Businor carrying some of our most experienced lightbringers and our most beautiful Harpy diplomats across. The Jadd shall embrace Aelantir, and be embraced by it in turn."
 jaddari_take_the_southern_river_title:0 "Take the Southern River"
 jaddari_take_the_southern_river_desc:0 "As the Dhenbasana nears the Gulf of Rahen, it grows thick with silt and with riches. The surrounding banks, whether lush jungle or equally lush farmland, are occupied by Harimari lords.The human-majority city of Sardiphadin, silk-capital of the Harimraj, has sought to make a name for itself since that tired state's final fall.\n\nBut all these facts are subordinate to one truth: all those who make their home by the southern river lack the light of Surael, and must be made to embrace it."
 jaddari_expand_local_administration_title:0 "Expand Local Administration"
 jaddari_expand_local_administration_desc:0 "Having studied the administration of the Harimraj, there are many lessons we can take away from them. One important factor is that we need an efficient local administration, but also one that is well integrated into the imperial machine. We cannot let the ministers get too powerful, or unwieldy. Instead we will have local governors directly answerable to the Divine-Herald."
 jaddari_a_deal_with_jyntas_title:0 "A Deal with Jyntas"
 jaddari_a_deal_with_jyntas_desc:0 "Since leaving the Salahad, our forces have conquered many cities, all of which claimed vast wealth and riches. There was debate between various legions, whether it was the caravansarai-palace of Sareyand, or the Lotus Court of Dhenijansar, or the Gold Hold of three gates, that truly stood above the rest on that scale (though all would agree they were equally impoverished in the only wealth that matters before we came).\n\nBut upon entrance to Sramaya, the question was settled once and for all: no conquered city will top it in splendour or riches. And now that it has found the truest wealth in all Halann, that of Surael's embrace, it is a shining jewel in our crown.\n\nAnd yet... one small manor, just outside the city gates, seems to somehow resist the light. The Lightbringers sent there wind up returning with a gap in their memories, even the most diplomatic emissary simply seems to wander and not reach it. Whoever resides there, it seems clear: they will only negotiate with the voice of Surael, the Divine-Herald themself."
 jaddari_lightbringers_in_haless_title:0 "Lightbringers in Haless"
 jaddari_lightbringers_in_haless_desc:0 "The Lightbringers have honed their craft in Bulwar and the Salahad, and it is time to bring the best of them to the jungles, plains, and palaces of Haless. No jungle is too dense, or mountain too treacherous, to escape Surael's light and those that bring it forth."
 jaddari_the_eastern_jadd_title:0 "The Eastern Jadd"
 jaddari_the_eastern_jadd_desc:0 "Once, Jaher marched east. Once, he conquered all that lay before him. And once, he died, the Halessi portion of the Phoenix Empire shattering beneath his fall. While Jexis expanded the Phoenix Empire to new heights, she could not put it all back together again.\n\nWe, too, have marched. We, too, have conquered. But while we remain Jexis's heirs, it is unsurprising that with a greater understanding of Surael's truth, we have also surpassed even the Masked Empress. Haless rests easy beneath our grasp, embracing the light of Jadd. And now that Surael's Sun has come, it shall never fall again."
 jaddari_jadd_philosophy_title:0 "Jadd Philosophy"
 jaddari_jadd_philosophy_desc:0 "Since those first days in the desert, The Jadd has been rooted in the truths and understandings Surael revealed to Jaddar. But the Jaddari, the Empire, and the faith have come a long ways since those days. While Jaddar's truths are universal and unchanging, there remain details that must be filled in, laws that must be clarified, questions that must be answered (or at least pondered).\n\nWith Rahen and Haless now fully in the light, we have seen the legions of philosophers that float down the Dhenbasana or study at the High Temples turn their attention to The Jadd, considering what Surael's brilliance lights up in fields far afield. It is a golden age for theological inquiry, for the Jadd, and undoubtedly for the Empire"
 jaddari_a_new_capital_for_haless_title:0 "A New Capital for Haless"
 jaddari_a_new_capital_for_haless_desc:0 "Haless has seen many empires, but none like ours. In the same vein, though Haless has many great cities, it demands a new capital befitting our status and Surael's glory.\n\nSarisung, the 5-district city that claimed to be the heart of Haless, also claimed to be unconquerable. We have made clear those old ideas were but shadows on the wall, now dispelled by Surael's blinding light, and so we should build the city into something new. Something glorious."
 jaddari_the_divine_symposium_title:0 "The First Divine Symposium"
 jaddari_the_divine_symposium_desc:0 "Haless has a long tradition of philosopher-kings, and the bickering of scholars hardly slowed even as we waged war around them. Now that Aizt Ralare is founded, we have an opportunity to direct these brilliant minds to consider the most important question on Halann: how do we best achieve Surael's purpose, and fulfill the dreams of Jaddar?\n\nWe shall gather every member of the School of Radiant Wisdom at the foot of the Golden Ambon, where the Herald shall speak to open the symposium, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice transmitted to the Quarter of the Suns and city beyond by its magic. And it is in this that we shall take yet another step towards Surael's truth."
 jaddari_heat_the_iron_title:0 "Heat the Iron"
 jaddari_heat_the_iron_desc:0 "We have come a long way since the Desert Elves began as a stranded, abandoned, legion. With the hobgoblins having joined our state, we've been provided a reminder of those days, and while our purpose has grown extensively, we must not forget that history. We should take the Hobgoblins that have seen the light of Jadd and distribute them throughout our armies, so they can remind every soldier of the power of unified purpose."
 jaddari_the_blazing_step_title:0 "The Blazing Step"
 jaddari_the_blazing_step_desc:0 "Most who join the Jadd legions do so expecting to spend their time in battle, facing our foes to make real Surael's truth in this world. What they actually spend their time doing is marching.\n\nSuch are the exigencies of serving an Empire which spans continents. But the hobgoblin military advisors we recently integrated into our army, having done plenty of marching themselves, have now developed a new technique. The Blazing Step should have our forces speeding across the Empire, second only in velocity to Surael's light itself."
 jaddari_the_deioderan_title:0 "The Deioderan"

But whenever we dance it in the future, we shall always remember this time.\n\nA time which pit sun against sun, brother against brother, empire against empire. A time of strife and of sorrow.

A small tribe of Siadúnan harpies captured a group of dying soldiers and saved them from death by dehydration. They nursed them back to life and an arrangement was made to exchange services.

Yet many of our new subjects, from peasant to noble, maintain the false beliefs of the Sun Cult.\n\nEvery day that these people maintain their heresy is a day their souls rot in the darkness, a day where they actively turn away from the light. Where once our soldiers marched now our Lightbringers must follow, to make clear Surael's will to all.

They are now an integral part of our army and our Empire, and the recently-completed Sunburst Mk. 1, which during testing blew a sizable hole in one of the mountains in the Eastern Salahad range, is simply testament to how they have found their ultimate calling in Surael's crusade."

Our first conquest, the beginning of the long chain of campaigns to come, will be the mountain fortress of Davharral.

From the occasional shipwrecked trader, we have learned it is the flag of the Bhuvauri, a state formed by slaves who slew their masters and took up the use of whip and chain for themselves.\n\nWhile Surael does frown on slavery, He also understands the need for pragmatism in our quest to ensure His light spreads east.

But it is Surael's will that even those furthest from His light be given the chance to serve him. Now that the Lotus Court has been made pure amidst the Jadd, we must launch a full review of what remains from the ministries, to see what might be incorporated of their ways, and what lessons may be learned from their failures."

 jaddari_abolish_slavery_desc:0 "When the Jadd was young, still a sun rising out of darkness, we made a deal with slavers. But we have always known slavery was an abomination. Enchaining others denies them their chance to fulfill their Surael-given purpose, perhaps the most foul thing one can do to another man. Now that our sun, Surael's sun, is shining high in the Noon sky, it is time to make that truth clear to all Rahen.\n\nThe slavers must be cast down, their chains broken, and Surael's truth enjoined across the realm: no man may be a slave, all are free to pursue His will."

We should make this truth clear to all our new subjects by organizing a massive celebration of the Sun and Surael across our lands, bringing the warmth and wonder of His light into every city, village, and home.\n\nThis is only a pause in our unending crusade against the darkness, but it is because of that truth that we must delight in such a celebration, to restore and rejuvenate us so that we may all fulfill our purpose under Surael."

Jaher attempted an invasion of his own, but a bloc of Kai states kept him off, until he sought richer opportunities in Yanshen.\n\nHowever, we see further than the conquerors of yore. The most valuable treasure is the soul, and it is priceless. Whatever the land may possess, its people are as important as any other in Surael's crusade.

That truth (and the exigencies of such a wide-ranging Empire) mean a variety of cities have considerable attraction as the site for the Radiant Court. Furthermore, some argue that just as the sun crosses the entire sky in its courses, so too should Surael's Court make its home in every part of the realm.\n\nWhatever the Divine Herald's thoughts on that argument, it is high time to formalize the process for choosing a court, and ensure a shared infrastructure to maintain bureaucratic continuity wherever it goes.

For if there was ever a single person since Jaher within whom Surael seemed to imbue His power, it would be the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In grace, fortitude, brilliance, strength, radiance, sheer power — no monarch before can compare, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] only rival is the Sun itself.

Today? Like the after-image of a bright light when you close your eyes, those memories are already fading, becoming out of date.

The caverns only offer many strange fungi but little in the way of sun-bright gold, though some would say it is our Surael-given duty to bring light to these vast wells of darkness — and surely any lessons we could learn from the expedition will serve us well in the crusade to come. Alternatively, we could focus largely on mapping the Dwarovrod, a relatively safe process, and one that would assist our future endeavours.\n\nWhere should we send our expedition.

Maybe they succumbed to a goblin ambush. Maybe they encountered some sort of monster that dwells within the depths of the earth.

There are some ministers, who, while no longer running the Raj they once served, still work to maintain the libraries. Those of them who have since come to see the Light of the Jadd are now called before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They bow deeply, greying fur long and thin. "Your Radiance," The oldest starts, "We have come bearing gifts. Within these libraries is the full administrative architecture of the Raj at the time of its fall. It lacks the information of the most recent years, but that can most easily be done once these lands are once again ruled from the Golden Palace. It would be our honour to serve you and handle the integration of these provinces into your empire. For the Light of Surael.""

The eunuchs presenting the finished work to the Divine Herald smile nervously, stammering about the view from the Mountain of Clear Sight and their own efforts to 'climb another floor'. [Root.Monarch.GetName] nods, and gestures them on.\n\nThey turn over the cover, revealing underneath it a massive tome, bound in bright red leather. Like feathers on a Harpy wing, the milk-white page is densely filled with numbers and letters. From [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] seat, the Divine Herald can just make out the names of various provinces within the far-flung Empire. The eunuchs explain that every piece of the Jadd Empire touched by Surael's light — that is to say, every single inch of it — is bound within these pages, not a detail or soul missed.\n\nThe Herald's eyes widen, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] leans in. And although the sun continues to shine, the harpies continue to sing, every piece of the world is exactly how it was the moment before — with this, a richer trove than any in Verkal Gulan, the Divine Herald knows [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] realm, Surael's realm, shall never be the same."

We bid him welcome, and after the customary hospitality rituals, he is eager to get to business.\n\nHe speaks of a new faith, The Jadd. But more importantly, he speaks of increased sovereignty, decreased taxes, and support from the Desert Legion in expanding our realm to absorb all Ghankedheni.\n\nWith one last flourish, and an invocation of his god, he comes to an end.

But times have changed and the empire has expanded. We have seen the rulership of the Sun Elves in Bulwar, the Khet in Kheterata and the human kings in Cannor. Of all it seems that the harimari have uniquely developed the skills needed to administer an expanding empire, centuries of philosopher-kings slowly honing a uniquely-styled bureaucracy.

As the greenish tinge to his face slowly faded, the brightness of his smile became apparent.\n\nHe quickly rushed to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and presented him with the calligraphic scrolls bearing the details of the pact.

When it reaches the Mountain of Clear Sight and finally crests its top, a Lightbringer standing there blows a ram's horn to signal the lighting of the bonfires below, around which the Deioderan will be danced, and danced, and danced. At Azka-Jadd the bells ring as they feel the warming light, at Jaddanzar the trumpets blow, in Bulwar a great conference of Lightbringer-theologians begins.\n\nIt is a dawn of wonder, it is a dawn of splendour; it is the dawn of Jubilation."

So it was inevitable that a mistimed move would cause one of the dancers to stumble and light the temple's curtains ablaze. While they escaped unharmed, albeit singed, the partying delayed any organized response and the temple has been badly damaged.

When it reaches Bulwar, it lights up the two most stubborn philosophers of the conclave, who have argued through the night. They will continue to argue even as they join the slow trickle of people following the Surani back home, from Jaddanzar or Azka-Jadd.\n\nIt is the end of the Sun's Jubilation.

The §ODeioderan§!.\n\nIt begins with Pelar Ten, watching the flame. Two dancers, circling the center bonfire, dip their torches within it. Each will watch their opponent's flame for the rest of the dance, eyes never straying to face or body. A moment's distraction, and they could easily get burned.\n\nThen, the bodies and fires flow as the music begins: Soin El, the song of the west. A song of yearning, of longing, of loss. A song of home, and the terrible things we would do — to ourselves, to one another — to return to it.\n\nThe first crescendo, and the dancers move into Inel Vaet, the breath of life. There is no fire without air, just as there is no dance without breath. This will be true throughout the Deioderan, but is never more clear than now, as they move in bursts of speed while performing dizzying acrobatics. The bonfire spikes, the torches flare, it seems guaranteed one of the dancers will catch ablaze.\n\nThen, suddenly — Kide, rest. Even the greatest fire burns to coals. Yet those coals are hotter than any burning flame, and will last long into the night. This phase is one of the most technically challenging parts of the dance, despite its seemingly simple and slow motions.\n\nAll it takes is a bit of kindling, a long high note in the music, and then the bonfire returns — the dancers proceeding into Kondranas, balance. They have become nigh-indistinguishable, a perfect match of flame and fuel, of strength and dexterity, of one against the other.\n\nBut as the two forces grow, they cannot stay in opposition forever, lest they break the world around them. Thus, just after the fiercest clash, they enter Enahasten, union of flame. Two bodies move as one, two fires burn as one, a reminder that every torch here on Halann is a fragment of Surael's flame in the skies above.\n\nAnd so. The music grows, the fire grows, the shadows grow. It is Renak Deran, the final dance. Soon, the dancers will rest, the flame will fade, the night will grow long. But for now, there is light, there is heat, and there is the wonder of a life lived for Surael."

In Verkal Gulan, even though the only thing visible above is miles of rock, the moment of the sun's zenith signals the tolling of a bell, calling all miners to return to the Citadel Delve. In Kufu, workers return to the coffee plantations; in Azanerdu, craftsmen relight the glass-smitheries' flames; all along the Suran the wheat-fields bow as their tenders return with sickle and hoe.\n\nIt is the end of the Triumph of the Sun.

The Eborthíl shipyards, which normally work around the clock assembling and maintaining Surael's Armada, fall silent even as the beauty above is put to music by Busilar's finest violinists. Cannorian wine is present at every evening banquet, grapes grown under His sun brewed by His servants into a drink delighting His people as they toast His brilliance.\n\nA deep joy thrums throughout the Empire, every delight on offer, and every worshipper of the Jadd is blessed with a hint of how it shall feel to be embraced by Surael's Rapture."

From across Halann, like moths to a flame, like planets to a sun, they come.\n\nInvitations were delivered by the Legions' finest horsemen weeks prior. To the Gnomish Chief Engineer and Hierarch, who warranted two separate ones despite the fact they're currently both the same person. To the Winelords, each branch of Siloriel receiving its own. To the dwarven Hold-lords (a somewhat awkward journey, with both steed and rider crammed into the Dwarven Rail) an invitation made by Verkal Gulan's finest goldsmiths. To the leader of the Lake Federation, with a check in at the Assembly Hall to ensure the correct recipient.\n\nAnd more, the Radiant Ball ignorable by no one. The old Electors of Anbennar, mingling with one another and forced to put aside political difference, historical enmity, or choice of deity. Alenic lords, eyes tightening at the sight of every piece of elven finery, still conduct themself with immaculate etiquette. Making them nervous, the Grey King of Grombar, having traded his furs for well-cut Esmari finery more befitting [Root.GetCapitalName]'s climate. Even emissaries from across the world in Aelantir; Marlliande's best-bred patricians discuss Malacnari weaponry with the Kylakas currently atop Kheionai's squabbling cities, while a priest-ambassador from the Eordandi court at Pelomar pretends to look at roses as she eavesdrops.\n\nEach and every attendee has been summoned here by Surael's own voice, His Divine Herald. An Escanni Witch-Queen, a pin of Corin's crest bright against her otherwise dark apparel, understands the rule of power even if she shrugs off other diplomatic norms. The Jaeng from Daengun, standing out amidst the mass with his faintly-glowing blade at his side and exotic attire, could not ignore an invitation from Haless's newest conqueror. The Mengurkha speaks quietly to his Oni counterpart the Rashenbir in a corner as the latter jots down notes on the proceedings, their Ogrish bulk making them jut out like stones in a river of dignitaries. Even the Khetarch has sent an envoy, an ethereal emanation that speaks not but watches all with bright eyes.\n\nWith a clap of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands, the Divine Herald summons the attention of all. With a smile, and a nod, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] signals the start of the ball. And, looking down from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dais, [Root.Monarch.GetName] cannot help but grin as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] watches all the powers of Halann dance below [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].

You can imagine, undoubtedly, the quiet pride Jaddar would take in every soldier resting from their duties within the Suraelic Barracks, every officer studying his old campaigns — and the Empire's more recent ones — in the Jaddanzar Academy, and every fiercely vigilant guard atop the Herald's Wall, even as they know the entire continent follows the light of Surael and His herald. Much has changed since Jaddar called the dispersed Desert Legion together, with a vision in his mind and the claim of his blood, but little has been forgotten."

Note as well, how all are constantly filled by legions of the devoted.\n\nLet us join the sun as it beats down upon a dhow pulling out of Brasan, sailing the Sun's Sea, arriving finally at Port Jaher — and do spare a moment to wonder about that old conqueror, how he would feel to see his old empire now infinitely surpassed. But just a single moment, for as the sun covers Cannor, the Jadd Empire's glory comes fully into focus. Anbennar, which has always meant unity depite its fractious and fractured reality, now finally understands its own name. Hear the bells of Tellum ring to mark its passage, and if you're feeling brave, follow as the light pours into countless artificer laboratories, where Surael's purpose is pursued in directions not representable by any heretofore known geometry.

But never imagine those that reside within these skyscrapers actually draw closer to Surael; to ascend to him requires service in His crusade, not simply rising above the land.\n\nYou may have expected this next vision, as you spotted their wine bottles refreshing Salahad-wanderers and spurring Raheni philosophers to new heights, but nothing can quite prepare you to see the vast vineyards of Rubenaire and Lorentainé.

But fear not, it shines bright in Aelantir beyond, as souls there too worship Surael with the fervor He deserves.

 jaddari_missions.60.d:0 "Jaddar Jexiszuir never knew his mother. Or that is how it seems, at least, as he never speaks of his birth amidst the Decade of Masks or his early life. His history only begins when he joined the Desert Legion, when he became part of the people that would one day bear his name. All he took from the Burned Empress was a last name, a birthright of Empires, and perhaps one another thing — a resolution his progeny would not have the same childhood as he.\n\nThat, at least, is what one would think seeing him with Jaddarésa, his daughter by Jasiéne Elaiennó. Almost three hundred years separates the elf and his harpy daughter. But watching the duo cross the sands of the Salahad, the zealous elf laughing at a joke his daughter makes, as she dashes about against the deep blue sky, you would not think it. To see him teach her the bow, not a harpy's natural weapon, but one Jaddarésa studies with care. To see them talk late into the night by the fire, she asking piercing questions of Surael and His worship, questions only a child could or would ask, and him slowly and gently revealing to her the truths that were once revealed to him atop Ebbušubtu.\n\nOne of those truths is this: Surael's work is more than His crusade. The sun burns and scorches, but it is also the fuel for all that lives and moves on Halann. Jaddar is a man of passion, devotes every waking hour to that work. To some in Bulwar, that has made him a mad zealot. To some in Rahen, it has made him an implacable conqueror. But to Jasiéne? It has made him a devoted husband, despite the exigencies of leading a nomad legion.\n\nAnd to Jaddarésa? It has made her feel like she is the luckiest harpy in the world. The one with a father caring, doting, inspiring, who plays with her and teaches her and watches her grow into the woman she is becoming. And who truly, truly, believes she has a role in Surael's work that no one else will have, no one else could have.\n\nThe years stretch out before Jaddar. He married Jasiéne knowing he would most likely bury her. He may well do the same for Jaddarésa. But for now, in this instant, there is just a father and his daughter. And in the years to come, there will be many an embrace, there will be the wiping away of tears, there will be proud smiles and delighted laughs. And that future of joy and sorrow is perhaps the brightest of Surael's blessings, among all he has been privileged to receive."

 jaddari_missions.61.d:0 "The gnoll, clad in the flowing and hooded robes of a desert wanderer, arrives just before sundown. Although many of his kind have seen the light over the past years, finding their place amidst Surael's servants rather than the meaninglessness of chaos and bloodshed, gnollish pilgrims to the Mountain of Clear Sight are still far and few between. Still, he is given a spot among the many intoning the prayers of the day's end, thanking Surael for His light and His protection against the Malevolent Darkness; his rough bass voice is a counterpoint to the more musical lilt of the Desert Elves.\n\nAt the prayers' end, as the light on Ebbušubtu begins to fade, he does not move, watching its slope slowly turn from yellow to orange to grey. And, for reasons known only to the Herald himself, Jaddar does not leave either. Though the warm embrace of Jasiéne Elaiennó beckons, though there is always the next campaign to plan, the same patience that once led him to Surael's light now leads him to stay by the fire, sitting in silence.\n\nAnd after a span of minutes — or is it hours? — the gnoll throws back his hood. Jaddar recognizes the face instantly, it was seared into his memory when it snapped at his throat, even as Surael's herald stabbed the Devourer-of-Suns through his blackened heart. And yet his only reaction is an exhalation of breath, at most a grunt.\n\nSo the gnoll begins to speak. Of his father, how he knew his cruelty intimately, yet still felt crushed to see him fall. Of fleeing with the rest of the pack, seeking to melt into the Salahad and escape the legions' thundering hooves. Of next encountering the Jaddari when a Lightbringer came to the oasis, bearing not sword or spear but books of the Herald's own teachings. Of seeing gnolls who had only known tooth and claw and blood and murder find a life in Surael's light, a purpose in His work. Of being one such gnoll.\n\nThat was years ago, now, but he is called by Surael to do more than merely fight off raids from his still-monstrous brethren and administer the Salahad's harsh justice. And so he has come to the Mountain of Clear Sight, to offer his services to His Herald, and tell his story. What will Jaddar decide?"

The particulars of the celebration vary from region to region, but even the smallest town will keep a fire going through the night, a reminder of the warmth and light we find in Surael's crusade.\n\nBut though the sun might touch all Halann, there is only one Divine-Herald, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can only appear in one place.

But the variety of architectural styles across the Empire would propose very different ways to do so: the Surani school proposes an austere design, reproducing the statues and inscriptions found in Bulwar's oldest temples; while the Raheni school argues for a more modern and elaborate approach, with bright gold and even brighter porcelain aplenty.

But the past few weeks, the libraries have been the Herald's sole domain. Rarely venturing outside into the light of Surael's sun, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has instead been devouring knowledge, binging as hard as any drunkard would with wine.

Historians from Cannor and Haless alike have already dubbed this event the Deioderan, after the fiery dance traditional to the Jaddari. One wrong step and you will get horribly burned."

Perhaps, in one of Bulwar's oldest temples, the Divine Herald of the Jaddanzar Empire will take the occasional swig from a bottle of the local winemakers' finest Sunlight as they run their fingers over stone that has glorified Surael's name for centuries. And perhaps, atop the tallest tower of the Lotus Court, the Divine Herald of the Nahana Jadd will take the occasional sip from a small cup of Yuanszi rice-wine (designed to get an Oni drunk) as they survey the capital of an old empire, and consider how it might best be redesigned to reflect Surael's light. But the two shall be alone, even if they drink under the same sky.\n\nIn the name of reunification, in competing visions for Surael's crusade, competing legions fought brutal battles and shed liters of blood. But every drop was a cloud before Surael's sun and a brick in the wall between two believers in the Jadd. A fire burnt to ash cannot be relit, a soul gone to Surael cannot be returned to Halann.

Perhaps they will revisit some of Jaddar's old journals over twin mugs of Liukhexingzhe liquour, letting the alcohol helping to immerse them in Jaddar's tactical and theological brilliance. Perhaps they will simply sit in silence, passing whatever liquid between them, as they watch Surael's sun go down.\n\nThat will come later. For now, there are more important tasks at hand. Reunifying two bureaucracies cleaved apart will be difficult, but not nearly as challenging as providing restitution to the war's wounded and succor to the bereaved. Yet the work of the Jadd faithful has not ended: across the reunited Empire, all must work to soon resume Surael's crusade.\n\nThe Deioderan is over, and with its end comes a renewed focus on fulfilling our duty to Surael!"

All for the sake of a grand temple heralding the western frontier. All for the sake of unity under Surael."

A notable exception to this is the province of Hašr, where a resistance movement has cropped up under Marudeen szal-Akur, The Hašr Hawk. After years of public sacrifices, destruction, and terror wreaked on their people by the Gnolls, they have finally stepped out of the long shadow which Zokka cast and into freedom.\n\nShocked by Sareyand's treacherous war against us for their ‘former lands’, which include the whole of Hašr, Marudeen has chosen to stand with our legions against the invading Sareyandi army in an attempt to assert their independence. Aided by the rapidly-organizing armies of Hašr, our beleaguered legions may have the support they need to crush the oncoming elven onslaught, and live to spread the light of Surael another day."

With the future of Hašr still in question, Marudeen hesitantly met with Jaddar to attempt to assert their independence.\n\nA lengthy discussion ensued between the Hašr Hawk and the Herald of Surael. They talked of the fact that every creature had the ability to spread the light of Surael, so long as they opened themselves to it. They talked of the need to banish the dark, both within themselves and across a Halann which seemed to be perpetually clouded by darkness. Finally, they talked of how Surael’s grace shone down on Hašr, and how the people of Hašr could work with the Jaddari legions to spread the light further.\n\nThe Hašr Hawk arrived at the Mountain of Clear Sight with doubt, worry, and a touch of darkness clouding his heart. He now rides back to Hašr brimming with the light of Surael, and as he returns, the light follows him through the cities and countryside of Hašr, now firm believers in the Jadd."

She is a child no longer, leading her people and serving Surael as [Root.GetName]'s foremost diplomat. One thing has not changed, however: she begins each day with archery practice. Today is no different; she can almost imagine her father's voice instructing her as she draws, aims, and fires, and though tears obscure her vision, her arrows still fly true.\n\nErelessa's day begins with re-reading what she last wrote down to ensure it is clear and complete. Today, she reviews a conversation with her father, conducted while he was ill four decades ago. "How do you ensure you spend every century devoted to Surael's purpose?", she asked. "By ensuring you spend every day devoted to Surael's purpose," he answered. Among all the lessons Jaddar taught, she keeps this one closest to her heart.\n\nJahid begins his day with group prayer, followed by strong coffee and fervent discussion of the Jadd. After all, he knows that just as a commander does not win a battle alone, all who surround you must equal you in devotion to Surael's cause. He has learned this twice: first, from his father, who died to slow Zokka's charge mere minutes before his grandfather slayed the demon. Second, in the years afterwards, bringing Surael's light to gnollish souls once-steeped in darkness.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is barely awake as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] leads the Desert Legion's elite in exercises. The drills ensure even the most complicated techniques of blade and bow become instinctual, and it seems the decades serving as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] father's second-in-command have made leading the Legion feel much the same -- [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] carries on uninterrupted, despite the hole in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart.\n\nWe mortals will never know how Surael revealed His truths to His prophet.

 jaddari_missions.1002.d:0 "Over a century ago, Jaddar Jexiszuir came down from Ebbušubtu with truths on his lips, a duty from Surael on his shoulders, and a fire in his eyes. Each day since, he has taught his truths to even those most astray or darkness-touched. He has been Surael's herald on Halann, a commander to the Desert Legion, and a chieftain to the Mašnsih. And he has spread the Jadd's fire across two continents.\n\nBut tonight, he is dead.\n\nIn Rahen, corrupt harimari host extra-lavish feasts; in what remains of the Phoenix Estates, heretics breathe sighs of relief. But Jaddar was not defined by his enemies, and neither will his death be.\n\nIn the shadow of the Paravimvata range, a harpy matriarch flies against a sky that feels ineffably emptier, no matter how many sobs and cries she fills it with. In a tent near Ebbušubtu, an elf shuts out the unceasing praying, brushes away the tears on her cheeks, and takes up a quill to put to paper every memory she has of the nine decades she knew her father (hoping it will keep them fresh for the centuries ahead). At a small oasis, a half-elf collapses into his mother's arms, and she begins to intone the teachings of the Jadd, just as she did countless times when he was young.\n\nThey are not alone. Across all the [Root.GetName], countless weep for the prophet that redeemed them from even the darkness's deepest clutches, the herald that led them to salvation and their place in Surael's crusade. Every night He fights the darkness, and every morning He rises anew to revitalize the world. For now, each will fight their own battles against sorrow and grief. But come the morning, the next page in the [Root.GetName]'s history shall be written."

But the harpies that have now appeared in [Root.Capital.GetName] are nothing like their species’ reputation.\n\nThey landed in the fields beyond the city and met with a group of scouts who led them to the city on foot, where the people got their first look at them. Beautiful, blue-feathered, and dressed in finely spun cloth and jewelry of gold, they were the picture of courtly grace. Their leader speaks our tongue, albeit with a lilting accent. She says they are from across the mountains, from the Elaiénna tribe, and bring a message of peace and harmony.\n\nNow standing before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] she tells the court of their god, Surael, who fights against the evils of the world, and how all those who help him in this fight against evil are equal in his eyes. No harimari stands above human, as no elf stands above harpy. All are equal in the Light. At least, those are her words."
