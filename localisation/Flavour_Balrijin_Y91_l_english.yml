 Y85_reaching_out_title:0 "Reaching Out"
 Y85_reaching_out_desc:0 "Foreign diplomacy was not something we pursued for a long time, until the state of Jiangdu attacked us. An internal rebellion erupted in their lands during that conflict, and that enemy of our enemy became our friend. When that war happened, we quickly found ourselves employing Jiangszun human diplomats to ease communications with foreign realms even more; these diplomats now form the Golden Tongue faction.\n\nThe people of Lanjinhui have been a great boon to our security, and getting more of such allies will surely further improve our standing, that is, if the diplomats of the Golden Tongue faction are to be believed... They have selected a few target realms who are known to treat local kobold minorities well, and now ask the state to finance diplomatic envoys to those realms."
 Y85_opening_migration_title:0 "Opening Up Migration"
 Y85_opening_migration_desc:0 "Our current policy of fostering positive relations with the realms that house our diaspora makes it easier for us to gain military allies, and the Golden Tongues insist that this policy be both continued and extended. \n\nThey have set their sights on perhaps the strongest of these states, the Wulin to the west. They wish not only to establish alliances, but also to allow for merchants, settlers and craftsmen to more easily travel to and from these realms, for the good of both our and their economy."
 Y85_martial_arts_exchange_title:0 "Martial Arts Exchange"
 Y85_martial_arts_exchange_desc:0 "The Wulin, master of vast lands to the west, also houses martial arts schools which can only be rivaled by our own Smouldering Claws and Kindled Scales.\n\nPerhaps an alliance doesn't have to be the final step in our relation with this western behemoth; an exchange of martial arts students and teachers could help all our styles develop."
 Y85_xiadao_goldscale_temple_title:0 "Xiadao Martial Arts Temple"
 Y85_xiadao_goldscale_temple_desc:0 "As the Smouldering Claw and the Kindled Scale clans continue to vie for key positions in our military through the reborn tradition of Dragon Dances, their champions and sages hone their skills not only on the hilltops of Balriza, but also in the schools of Xiadao…\n\nBut whilst they come to learn, some stay to teach, so much so that the kobold district in the city now boasts its own martial arts schools, where Claws, Scales, independents and members from minor martial kobold clans all teach their arts. The next step would be to unify these schools into one large complex, on which our state can exert its influence more easily."
 Y85_forming_the_orders_title:0 "Forming The Orders"
 Y85_forming_the_orders_desc:0 "After yet another clash between Claws and Scales in the capital, accompanied with over a dozen hospitalisations, the Sage Council has decided to enact a policy of geographical distancing.\n\nThe two clans are to start moving their training facilities to the countryside, to ensure youth brimming with vigour but lacking in discipline stop breaking each other's kneecaps over who has the best fighting style. To this end we must ensure ample space is available for them to settle."
 Y85_integrate_human_auxillaries_title:0 "Human Auxillaries"
 Y85_integrate_human_auxillaries_desc:0 "As our military has become more active over the last few decades, reforms have been implemented to modernise our military. One branch which we have only recently started to really take seriously, is the idea of cavalry. Combat on horseback, or even on terrorbirds for that matter, has always been difficult for us kobolds due to us being... vertically challenged.\n\nAs such, it is only logical that we supplement our kobold infantry with partially human cavalry. To facilitate this, trustworthy human subjects will be needed."
 Y85_a_new_status_quo_title:0 "A New Status Quo"
 Y85_a_new_status_quo_desc:0 "With the rivalry between the Claws and Scales deescalated, our realm can finally finish its military reforms!\n\nA new system is to be implemented, where the sages or their champions will no longer fight for military office, but rather divide the decision-making along offensive and defensive lines. The new system may not be perfect, but it is ours."
 Y85_awaken_smouldering_clan_title:0 "Smouldering Claw Clan"
 Y85_awaken_smouldering_clan_desc:0 "The Smouldering Claw Clan, once a clan of great renown, are best known for their aggressive martial arts styles, which bleed over into their military decision-making. They earned respect for singleclawedly resisting the subjugation of our people during the times of Harimar and Jaher, but faded into relative obscurity during the calm last few centuries.\n\nIt wasn't until the first war against Jiangdu that they once again accumulated some renown for defeating a Jiangdu regiment in Longdao whilst outnumbered two to one. If we are to lead offensive campaigns of our own with success, we will surely need their expertise once again.\n\nIt is time to awaken the Smouldering Claw clan, for we are going on the attack once again."
 Y85_reinstitute_dragon_dances_title:0 "Reinstitute Dragon Dances"
 Y85_reinstitute_dragon_dances_desc:0 "The current way our military functions, as several separate factions - the most prominent being the Claws and Scales, being paid for by taxes but refusing to operate under the command of a unified structure - is hampering our military potential. In order to convince prominent military figures to cooperate or to legitimise any commands coming from someone of another faction, we need a reform. \n\nThe Golden Sage has not come up with a new idea however, but rather a very old one- The Dragon Dances. In ancient times clan leaders, sages or even brothers would solve disputes or establish hierarchy through the only way no one could challenge- martial arts. \n\nThe Dragon Dances will function as a way to ensure all kobold snouts are pointing the same direction, and the strongest fighters can obtain and hold onto vital military positions."
 Y85_great_knowing_eye_title:0 "The Great Knowing Eye"
 Y85_great_knowing_eye_desc:0 "With their headquarters established and the requested spell components flowing in from across the realm, the sage of the Knowing Eye clan claims that everything is in place for their ambitious ritual. They now only await an upcoming celestial conjunction, due to occur in a few days..."
 Y85_phokhao_expedition_title:0 "The Phokhao Expedition"
 Y85_phokhao_expedition_desc:0 "After the disappointment following the thorough search of even the most northern mountaintop of the Ogre Hills, the well of ideas has run dry. To the west lie the inhospitable lands of the hobgoblins, and to the north a mountain range so unscalable only a very stubborn species of goats appears to call it home. \n\nThe way forward was unclear, until the idea to send small parties, be they hired adventurers or government employees to nearby climbable mountains and hills. Most of these were manageable, but the Phokhao mountain range calls for a military style sweep."
 Y85_nephrite_contacts_title:0 "Nephrite Contacts"
 Y85_nephrite_contacts_desc:0 "Whilst the Phokhao expedition might not have led to finding Balris, our usage of dwarven mountain guides and our purchasing of supplies and climbing equipment have fostered a positive relationship between us and the dwarves.\n\nReturning officials can talk for hours on end about their grand hold, impressive architecture, beards, beer and knowledge about mountain living. Perhaps it is time we invited some of them for a visit."
 Y85_demand_access_to_hills_title:0 "Demand Access To Hills"
 Y85_demand_access_to_hills_desc:0 "The Knowing Eye Clan, which handles most information gathering in the realm, has come before the Sage Council with reports of a large golden beast just across the border in Jinqiu -- could this be Balris The Gold? \n\nAny rumor that could lead us to be Balris is both too good to be true and too important to not investigate. With our relations with the vampiric Eternal Council to the west being chilly at best, we are going to have to go in by force if we wish to scour the area thoroughly."
 Y85_jinqiu_hills_title:0 "The Jinqiu Hills"
 Y85_jinqiu_hills_desc:0 "It's time to conduct an exhaustive sweep of the entire Jinqiu hills for this alleged golden beast. To do so we must first have absolute control of the lands in question."
 Y85_a_new_clue_title:0 "A New Clue"
 Y85_a_new_clue_desc:0 "The Libraries of Jincheng are extensive, yet never has a single kobold set foot in them, or even been allowed to peruse a book. This has to change soon, as Beikling informants tell our spymaster, the sage of the Knowing Eye clan -- a collection of minor clans with a vast network of informants, spies, assassins, thieves and, most notoriously, diviners -- of the presence of vast wells of knowledge being available in that library, including ancient accounts of mythical beasts.\n\nIf we are to find Balris, this is the next step."
 Y85_into_unbeksu_title:0 "Into Unbeksu"
 Y85_into_unbeksu_desc:0 "Following ancient sightings of a golden 'cloud' moving northwest from Jinqiu, it is time to pay the ogres a visit..."
 Y85_northern_oni_hills_title:0 "Northern Ogre Hills"
 Y85_northern_oni_hills_desc:0 "If the southern ogre hills didn't house Balris, then surely we can find him atop a northern mountaintop, right?"
 Y85_send_out_word_title:0 "Send Out Word"
 Y85_send_out_word_desc:0 "It is time to send word to all settlements near the mountains of Haless, someone must have seen Balris in the last thousand years..."
 Y85_jade_mountains_title:0 "The Jade Mountains"
 Y85_jade_mountains_desc:0 "'Climbing the jade mountains? You folk are insane, that's not doable.'\n-A Nephrite dwarf who climbs Phokhao for fun.\n\nWe have to do it, and we will."
 Y85_balkhangfa_palace_title:0 "Balkhangfa Palace"
 Y85_balkhangfa_palace_desc:0 "If Balris is to come home, we must ensure Balkhangfa is in a better state than ever; we cannot afford to disappoint him. \n\nTo do so however, we will first have to ensure building materials can reach the cavern more easily, as of now the path is far too steep for any caravan."
 Y85_warming_a_lonely_heart_title:0 "Warming a Lonely Heart"
 Y85_warming_a_lonely_heart_desc:0 "From the expedition's report, it is clear that Balris is caught in a mire of loneliness and grief. To pull Him from it, and persuade Him to stay, we must ensure that He wants for nothing physically, emotionally, or philosophically. To the best of our abilities have we shaped our realm in the image of His words, forged friendships and alliances all across the continent, and received tribute of both gold and sustenance into the halls of Balkhangfa Palace. Let us hope it is enough."
 Y85_fortify_balriza_title:0 "Repair The Balriza Rzong"
 Y85_fortify_balriza_desc:0 "The Balriza Rzong, the fortifications of Balriza, built to take advantage of the narrow pass up the mountain-plateau, was sabotaged by the Sun Elves during the time of Jaher to prevent revolt. Ever since it has been in a state of disrepair.\n\nThe recent conflict against Jiangdu instilled into the council the acute necessity to invest into this defensive corridor."
 Y85_finish_the_ri_iha_khang_title:0 "Repair The Ri-Iha Khang"
 Y85_finish_the_ri_iha_khang_desc:0 "The Balriza Rzong isn't the only part of Balriza to have suffered from the time of Jaher and his son Jaerel. The centerpiece of Balriza proper, the Ri-Iha Khang (the temple on the hill) was also heavily damaged during the time of Jaher; this was The Great Burning, a humiliating period in which Sun Elves sought to erase our deification of Balris and defeat our spirit.\n\nThey succeeded in neither, but the temple sure did burn. A repair has been long overdue."
 Y85_a_second_home_title:0 "A Second Home"
 Y85_a_second_home_desc:0 "Yinsheng has been a popular area for kobold settlers ever since the conquest. It's rich in iron, has a plenitude of hilltops and has a low population of humans... If we can ensure proper infrastructure and protection for the province, it will surely grow into a profitable colony for the realm."
 Y85_beikling_brothers_title:0 "Beikling Brothers"
 Y85_beikling_brothers_desc:0 "The Beikling people are religiously misguided, but culturally more similar than other humans. They are not people of the fields, rivers, or cities. Instead, they trace their ancestors back to hilltop villages, whose inhabitants knew the valleys, peaks, and caves like no other.\n\nIf only we could convince them of the teachings of Balris, we could become brothers."
 Y85_golden_shirgrii_title:0 "Golden Shirgrii"
 Y85_golden_shirgrii_desc:0 "The Beikling humans have proven themselves corrigible, and though it is still a work in progress, they are finding their place in our society, and as they do, new factions arise.\n\nThe most prominent of such factions is a sort of Beikling-Goldscale union of craftsmen, artisans, and miners. They are organising mostly in the far north-east, in the gold-rich province of Kabiurgarko, whose humans have long suffered under the ogre yoke. \n\nIt might be early to give them a seat on the council, and it is an unprecedented event for a human to be on the Sage Council, but doing so would surely make the people more willing to embrace the light of Balris; plus there's plenty of profit to be made with these men..."
 Y85_northern_ogre_hills_settlements_title:0 "Ogre Hills Settlements"
 Y85_northern_ogre_hills_settlements_desc:0 "After the success of kobold colonies closer to Balriza, settlers have started to get more and more ambitious, sometimes traveling the same roads that our armies are still fighting over.\n\nThe northern Ogre Hills are far from safe, yet the gem-rich lands of Shinukhorchi attract many ambitious miners. With a little stimulation, it can be turned into another profitable and sustainable colony."
 Y85_shinukhorchi_purification_title:0 "Shinukhorchi Outpost"
 Y85_shinukhorchi_purification_desc:0 "Shinukhorchi shows potential as a regional outpost, but it needs significant government investments before it can become the regional capital of the north many civil servants think it one day will be."
 Y85_finish_the_blue_scarf_uprising_title:0 "Finish Blue Scarf Uprising"
 Y85_finish_the_blue_scarf_uprising_desc:0 "The people of Lanjinhui have helped us push back the invasion from Jiangdu, but it is far from over... The city of Jiangdu still stands, and thus the war is only on pause. \n\nWhenever we are ready to finish this, and Jiangdu seems to have weaker allies than Lanjinhui, we should give them the signal that we're ready!"
 Y85_blue_scarf_victory_title:0 "Blue Scarf Victory"
 Y85_blue_scarf_victory_desc:0 "Down with the tyrants, away with the aggressors!"
 Y85_the_forbidden_city_title:0 "The Forbidden City"
 Y85_the_forbidden_city_desc:0 "Long have kobolds been refused entry to Jiangdu. The previous government saw us as unclean, thieving, and inferior.\n\nBut If we are inferior, then why does that government no longer exist, whilst our army parades through the city? Curious... It seems like the city is no longer off-limits for our people."
 Y85_free_passage_act_title:0 "The Free Passage Act"
 Y85_free_passage_act_desc:0 "Allowing all those carrying Lanjinhui papers toll-free entry into our realm and asking Lanjinhui to do the same with ours will allow both our people greater prosperity and further strengthen our bonds."
 Y85_establish_the_military_council_title:0 "The Military Council"
 Y85_establish_the_military_council_desc:0 "The Peasant Republic with its mayor are capable of handling internal affairs rather well, but their state doesn't excel at continuing the insurrection on oppression they declared.\n\nPerhaps we can help nudge our allies to make the right moves if we advise them."
 Y85_continent_wide_revolution_title:0 "Continental Revolt"
 Y85_continent_wide_revolution_desc:0 "The Lanjinhui ambition is noble; to bring fair rule to all of Haless. But for them to realise their goals, they will first need to legitimise themselves by proving their can beat back the eunuchs, stratocracies, and monarchies."
 Y85_merge_foreign_diplomacy_title:0 "Merge Foreign Diplomacy"
 Y85_merge_foreign_diplomacy_desc:0 "Lanjinhui and Balrijin have such intertwined diplomatic stances, that the step to combine our foreign policy is not that far-fetched. Surely the Lanjinhui government can be convinced of this as well."
 Y85_yanzhin_riches_title:0 "Yanzhong Riches"
 Y85_yanzhin_riches_desc:0 "To the south of our great mountain home lies the grand river valley, with Yanzhong sitting there, poorly defended and incredibly rich. The alliance of cities has long guided merchants away from our lands and into their lap, and who can blame them, with markets so perfectly situated... Our burgeoning economy needs those markets for our own."
 Y85_eastward_flow_title:0 "Eastward Pull"
 Y85_eastward_flow_desc:0 "The traders to our west in Bianfang and Shamakhad far too often travel to the Raj to do business. Our markets must be bigger, our roads better and safer. Then we will be able to pull them all eastward."
 Y85_dominate_yanshen_trade_title:0 "Dominate Yansheni Trade"
 Y85_dominate_yanshen_trade_desc:0 "Our control of the trade in Yanshen and the taxation thereof is one of the primary sources of income for our government. In order to increase that income, we need to take the taxation privilege away from our subject states and increase our hold all the way to the sea!"
 Y85_the_scale_bank_title:0 "The Scale Bank"
 Y85_the_scale_bank_desc:0 "The so-called "Scale Barons" of the Grasping Tail faction have been toiling away at plans for a nationalised banking institution, aiming to regulate inflation brought on by gold mines such as the Kabiurgarko mine.\n\nThe Scale Bank Initiative facilitates the creation of a national bank, with its headquarters right in the financial district in Xerrivur. The drafted institution will one day grow to be the undisputed financial regulator of the realm."
 Y85_formalise_scale_currency_title:0 "Formalise Scale Currency"
 Y85_formalise_scale_currency_desc:0 "Our people have been trading their scales to one another or the humans for centuries. Yet the Yansheni humans tend to see them more as a trinket than a form of currency.\n\nBy declaring the scales to be legal tender in both our own realm and demanding our subject states to do the same, we can legitimise it as a new currency, which will grant our people a passive income as they shed their scales. Such a move would ease the lives of kobolds across the entire continent!"
 Y85_yanshen_bankers_union_title:0 "Yansheni Bankers Union"
 Y85_yanshen_bankers_union_desc:0 "The banking institutions of Yanshen are disorganised and plentiful, but a plurality of them have at least partial Goldscale ownership. This presents an opportunity- a centralization of kobold banks under the oversight of a single national entity."
 Y85_continental_success_title:0 "Continental Success"
 Y85_continental_success_desc:0 "Global Trade as a phenomenon has ebbed and flowed with the comings and goings of great empires, but with the whole world now moving forward, it is theorized that it will become a constant. We should consolidate our grip on regional trade, so that our people may prosper forever."
 Y85_the_balris_reforms_title:0 "The Balris Reforms"
 Y85_the_balris_reforms_desc:0 "When Balris left us, he had made us wise, when he was away, we interpreted his many teachings to the best of our abilities, but now that he has returned, he can once again guide us on the path of enlightenment. \n\nBalris is discontent with how powerful the clergy has gotten and how our government muddies the purity of his teachings by letting non-clerical sages make spiritual decisions."
 Y85_end_of_the_sage_era_title:0 "End The Sage Era"
 Y85_end_of_the_sage_era_desc:0 "Balris has read up on the various forms of government from our neighbours and has given it his own twist. He now wishes for us to implement a constitution which would transition the realm into a parliamentary republic. \n\nTo accomplish this, the old guard clergy needs to be weakened first, and passing the reforms will anger and weaken the clergy even further, but no Goldscale can refuse Balris."
 Y85_balkhangfa_administration_title:0 "Balkhangfa Administration"
 Y85_balkhangfa_administration_desc:0 "Our administration is rapidly changing: whereas previously the clergy played a vital role in keeping population records and aiding tax collection, such practices have now been abandoned. The administrative documentation will now be stored in the ever-expanding tunnels and rooms of Balkhangfa Palace."
 Y85_deep_state_government_title:0 "Deep State Government"
 Y85_deep_state_government_desc:0 "Whenever a kobold needs a government file that is older than a year, they have to enter and get lost in what is commonly referred to as 'The Deep State', the tunnels under Balkhangfa.\n\nThey go so deep that they penetrate the very caves that our ancestors are said to have lived in. These caves are now used as storage for infrequently used documentation and the like."
 Y85_yansheni_hegemon_title:0 "Yansheni Hegemon"
 Y85_yansheni_hegemon_desc:0 "We have shown to the world that kobolds are a capable people, if not the most capable one. Our unification of Yanshen is unlike any other before us, for we came not from a foreign empire with massive legions, but a cave with mere hopes and dreams. \n\nWhat will truly set us apart however, is how we will rule with a golden claw, not an iron fist. Our empire will not crumble, Balrijin will not fall."
 Y85_the_old_order_title:0 "Restore Old Order"
 Y85_the_old_order_desc:0 "For countless centuries, the Shamakhad valley has been home to what are now called The Ruin Kingdoms, but ever since the hobgoblins came out of the Jade Mines in 1422, they have wreaked havoc on the region.\n\nBalris would like to see order restored to this region for various reasons. The hobgoblins have proven ruthless and incompatible with kobold or even human society, and their merchants seem unwilling to engage in mutually beneficial trading with much of Yanshen, not to mention the danger they pose to the stability on the continent and the continuation of society and diplomacy as we know it.\n\nIt is time to prepare for our biggest war yet."
 Y85_protect_ruin_kingdoms_title:0 "Protect The Ruin Kingdoms"
 Y85_protect_ruin_kingdoms_desc:0 "The Ruin Kingdoms have been reestablished through our great effort, but they cannot be expected to survive on their own, and our military cannot be expected to go home without a sense of accomplishment for koboldkind.\n\nThus it has been decided to attempt to use our influence, debts and favours in the region to nurture a state of dependency from the Ruin Kingdoms."
 Y85_demand_blackstep_tribute_title:0 "Settle Shamakhad"
 Y85_demand_blackstep_tribute_desc:0 "The Shamakhad valley is now firmly within our grasp, but in order to ensure that we can effectively administer the region during times of trouble, there needs to be a loyal Goldscale class present.\n\nTo this end we must demand the Ruin Kingdoms agree to our exact terms and stimulate Goldscale migration into the region."
 Y85_expand_blackstep_territory_title:0 "Shamakhad Scale Banks"
 Y85_expand_blackstep_territory_desc:0 "With a Scale Baron president in charge, it is now time to make true a campaign promise that is as old as the victory over The Command: incorporating the banks of the Ruin Kingdoms into the Scale Banks."
 Y85_merge_banking_institutions_title:0 "Lanjinhui Representation"
 Y85_merge_banking_institutions_desc:0 "Balris has said He wishes to see the people of Lanjinhui properly represented in our elections. To fulfill His wish, Lanjinhui nationals will be given the right to vote during elections and their lands will be allotted parliamentary seats. \n\nLet the world know we are fair overlords."
 Y85_develop_lanjinhui_institutions_title:0 "Lanjinhui Institutions"
 Y85_develop_lanjinhui_institutions_desc:0 "Our friends in Lanjinhui play a vital role in our finances through taxes and trade opportunities, they aid our military through experience and reinforcements, and they supplement our diplomats with Jiangszun experts like the Golden Tongue faction. In short, they are invaluable to us; as such we cannot allow them to fall behind on the world stage. And neither can we."
 Y85_tianlou_trade_title:0 "Tianlou Trade"
 Y85_tianlou_trade_desc:0 "For as long as our records go back, Tianlou has been the richest city in Yanshen, and for the first time in forever, we have a chance to make it truly ours and exploit its great riches.\n\nMany empires have made it their seat of government and raked in trade profits by steering the region's trade there through great markets, festivals, incentives, and subsidies... It's a bit far away for us to directly organise, but together with Lanjinhui we can manage quite nicely."
 Y85_the_golden_republic_title:0 "The Golden Republic"
 Y85_the_golden_republic_desc:0 "Lanjinhui and Balrijin are now so interwoven that many speak of a single state. Whilst that might be premature, factions on both sides of the border now wish for us to go further than a cooperating military, joint foreign diplomacy, and a joint banking system.\n\nSome call for a true unification, whilst others call for tighter bonds where it is beneficial, but to keep the two states existing as they are... With the birth of our republic, voter representation and parliamentary seats for Lanjinhui are now also a hot debate topic."

 flavour_balrijin.1.t:0 "Smouldering Claw & Kindled Scale"
 flavour_balrijin.1.d:0 "As the Sage Council once more grants a seat to the Smouldering Claw clan, it is clear the Kindled Scale faction agreed only out of sheer necessity. Relations between the two clans have seen better days, with recent Golden Sages often being from the Kindled Scales, and they have often seen themselves at the losing end of clan disputes and financial 'reform'.\n\nThis ends today, however, as the clan once more takes up the position it used to hold for centuries- the striking arm of the Goldscale nation."
 flavour_balrijin.1.a:0 "May The Smouldering Claw strangle our enemies once more"

 flavour_balrijin.2.t:0 "The First Dragon Dance"

Now we have not only found Him, but convinced Him to come back to us once more. We can finally have true guidance again. \n\nAs Balris flies over the realm, taking in His new domain, fireworks and mesmerising magical projectiles fill the air. A feast of epic proportions was raging underneath his visage. Days later, He is firmly nestled into Balkhangfa Palace and has begun His role of guiding the nation. \n\nThough Balris does not wish to become the formal lord of our realm, his mere presence and the advice he offers from his abode in Balkhangfa Palace will surely usher in a new era! His first point of order appears to be curtailing the power of the clergy, who, according to Him, have allowed the meaning of his teachings to become distorted for their benefit over his thousand-year absence."

They suggest that if this were to occur, our state ought to be known by a new name, "Xerlanza," (a combination of the Goldscale words for "gold" and "earth" with the Jiangyang word for "blue") to commemorate such a momentous occasion. Opponents of a full integration claim that it would put too much strain on the administrative capacity of the realm, whilst proponents say it will lead to an ultimately stronger realm. Many political parties would rather not have either option happen, as it would empower Lanjinhui voters.

All citizens are allowed to vote, but people living in provinces with a seat in parliament will be counted double. \n\nThere are many parties in the realm, but the primary ones are: \nThe Alliance, an uneasy union of the Smouldering Claw and the Kindled Scale clans, aiming to represent all soldiers of the realm and garnering much of the military vote; \nThe United Guilds, a Beikling-Goldscale party aimed at local autonomy, non-interventionism, and beneficial policies for the countless craftsmen, artisans, and miners in the Beikling regions, the party being spearheaded by the Teeming Arm faction; \nThe Old Guard, a party consisting of career politicians, clergy, and retired Knowing Eye secret service personnel and diviners, who take pride in protecting the constitution, continuing the veneration of Balris, and improving the internal stability of the realm; \nThe Scale Barons, a party for the rich, by the rich, focused on protecting and expanding their mercantile and banking interests along the Yan river, led by the Grasping Tail clan; \nAnd finally, the Lanjinhui National Party, originally formed to represent the interests of Lanjinhui peasants, has since expanded its coalition to include humans and rural peasantry throughout the republic. \n\nOut of these parties, the following two have won the first round, and if Balris is going to endorse either of them, now would be the time."

As much as the logistics teams struggled, doubly so did the spearhead, for they had to alter the terrain and breathe the thinnest air of them all. To this end, mages have become increasingly vital for the expedition spearhead, with air being siphoned in whilst ice is molten with fire magic, and snow displaced through thunderous claps of magic.

After a pause, Balris opened his mouth and began to speak.\n\n"Oh my, it truly has been an age and a half since I heard that particular song," He sighed, "When I left your people to discover the fates of my brethren, I had only intended to be gone for a short while. For a century or more I soared on the winds of every sky on tired wings, walked the streets of every city in mortal guise, searching in desperation for any clue I could, but in the end, I found that most of my kin were slain and the trails of the rest went cold, so I gave up hope. In my despair, I retired here, resigned to the probability that I am the last of my kind. To little avail, I tried to forget Jyntas' wit, Aakhet's passion, Alos' courage..." There was a catch in the Dragon Sage's throat, and another tear ran down His great, golden face. Then, He drew in a great breath, rising to his feet, fresh snow from the previous night's storm cascading from His colossal back and wings. \n\n"All I managed to forget was the warmth and joy of my time among the Goldscales. Your performance, little one," He said, smiling down at the young musician, "has reminded me. Thank you. Truly, Kiu's spirit is alive in your heart. What is your name?" \n\n"B-Batavix, my Lord," the boy stammered, shaking in the snow, but still managing to meet the Wyrm's gaze. \n\n"Well, Batavix, one cannot wallow forever, even one as long lived as I," Balris declared, "I think it high past time for my vigil here to end. I suppose I shall come visit." The crowd roared, as Batavix was lifted up and paraded around the caldera. The cheering began working its way down Balris' Rest, infecting the kobolds below, and it was not long before the entire 170 miles of caravan knew. \n\nBalris continued, "Now if you all don't mind, it's terribly early, and I'd like to sleep some more". With that said, most of the Goldscales began the arduous journey back to Balriza, pondering on how not to disappoint Balris when He arrives."

 Y85_establish_smouldering_hq_title:0 "Establish The Smouldering Claw Headquarters"
 Y85_establish_smouldering_hq_desc:0 "As we push westward and expand our territory, the battlefields on which we fight are growing increasingly distant from Balriza. The offence-minded Smouldering Claw clan, historically based in a small fort at the foot of our mountain capital, have expressed a desire to be located closer to our future warfronts and asked for permission to construct a new fortress-monastery in Emgolú to serve as their headquarters."
 Y85_establish_kindled_hq_title:0 "Establish The Kindled Scale Headquarters"
 Y85_establish_kindled_hq_desc:0 "Once the ceremonial life-wards of the Dragon-Sage, the steadfast fighters of the Kindled Scale turned their focus toward the defense of Balriza from external threats following the Great Wyrm's departure nearly one thousand years ago. As we have expanded our territory, these stalwart defenders have taken on the responsibility of protecting all cities within our realm. With the seizure of the major mountain passes at Jieshik and Chashangyik, they are proposing the creation of a mighty fortress at Yinsheng, from which they can better intercept any incursions from the Nuugdan Tsarai to our north."
 Y85_establish_teeming_hq_title:0 "Establish The Teeming Arm Headquarters"
 Y85_establish_teeming_hq_desc:0 "With our hold over southern Unbesku now secure and oni influence over the region in decline, the hills around Kabiurgarko are experiencing a massive economic boom. Beikling and Goldscale miners are swarming into the city, each hoping to stake a claim of their own in the mineral-rich countryside. Meanwhile, the sudden overabundance of ores and rough gems has overwhelmed the logistics of the local smiths and jewelers. The Teeming Arm seek our permission to construct an expansive storage and administrative facility to centralize control and bring some semblance of order to the area's affairs."
 Y85_establish_golden_hq_title:0 "Establish The Golden Tongue Headquarters"
 Y85_establish_golden_hq_desc:0 "As our domain grows and we become more entwined with the wider goings-on in Yanshen, the remoteness of our capital is becoming increasingly inconvenient for routine diplomacy. The Golden Tongue clan wish to establish a new hub in Yanzhong so that their envoys can be quickly dispatched up and down the Yan. While any embassy wishing to speak directly with the Golden Sage would still need to make the trek to Balriza, the proposed facility would greatly improve the efficiency and speed of our lower-level diplomatic communiqués."
 Y85_establish_knowing_hq_title:0 "Establish The Knowing Eye Headquarters"
 Y85_establish_knowing_hq_desc:0 "After the successful extraction of a clue regarding Balris from the libraries of Jincheng, the Knowing Eye have requested increased funding to construct a great tower and academy complex in Balriza to house all matters of spy craft, divination and other types of information gathering vital to steadying the affairs of state. What's more, the Knowing Eye sage claims that the proposed site sits on a potent intersection of ley lines, which, with an ample supply of diviners and spell components, could enable a ritual of unprecedented scale to be devised which may allow us to divine the whereabouts of Balris the Gold."
 Y85_establish_grasping_hq_title:0 "Establish The Grasping Tail Headquarters"
 Y85_establish_grasping_hq_desc:0 "Though Balriza is a prosperous and beautiful city, it is rather remote from the rest of Yanshen, as the surrounding mountain range makes travel rough going for all save ourselves, dwarves, and the hardiest Beikling. This makes our beloved capital ill-equipped to serve as the primary commercial hub of our growing domain. The half-subterranean hill-town of Xerrivur, on the other hand, is ideally placed along a tributary of the mighty Yan River and has plenty of space to build, while still being within comfortable distance to supply Balriza. The Grasping Tail clan have drawn up blueprints for a new market plaza in Xerrivur where lowland merchants may offload their goods and leave the difficult hike to Balriza for the experts."

 balrijin_sage_council_reform:0 "Sage Council"
 balrijin_sage_council_reform_desc:0 "The Sage Council is the theocratic council of Balrijin, consisting of the sages of the most powerful or affluent clans, factions, and guilds in the realm. They congregate in the Ri-Iha Khang temple at the top of Balriza to discuss matters of both state and faith, but in the end the Golden Sage, a sage picked among the council, has the final word. The Golden Sage is to interpret the teachings of Balris and apply them as closely as possible. If they become unable to fulfill their duties, their Protégé, who is picked from among the current sages, will take their place."
 golden_republic_reform:0 "Golden Republic"
 golden_republic_reform_desc:0 "A republic shaped under oversight of Balris, the Golden Republic grants representation to the masses through a parliament and limits the influence of the previously entrenched clergy and old guard. This old guard still often delivers presidential candidates, but is much less powerful than before. The constitution dictates the rights of individual citizens, alleviating tensions between kobolds, humans, and others."

 deep_state_government_reform_desc:0 "Deep below the central chamber of Balkhangfa Palace, where Balris snores, lie a dozen levels used by the administration, but below that lie even more levels, hidden from the public. This is where counterespionage is orchestrated, political prisoners are interrogated, and where the electoral process is protected from rigging or corruption. This is the deep state."
