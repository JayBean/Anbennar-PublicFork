 thangoya_1_5_title:0 "Memory of A Sunrise"
 thangoya_1_5_desc:0 "Hiderion may've been defeated, but it doesn't mean that his ideals are dead. The elven communities of Azkare still hold true to many of his ideals, promoting peaceful cooperation between many cultures and races under the Republic. With enough encouragement, they can be a key factor in turning the ones who may still doubt the cause of our republic into the united force of Kai that we strive for."
 thangoya_1_6_title:0 "Centuries of Horsemanship"
 thangoya_1_6_desc:0 "If there is one thing Sikai should be known about, it's their Purebred horses. Bred specifically for their speed and strength in stables of Khao Elnak, these steeds are the best in dealing devastating charges to the opponents. Yet on the fields of Lektonmai, the quality of the horses weren't the main factor in deciding the battle's outcome. With both sides riding the Purebreds, it was the Azkarean training that caused their devastating victory, much to the surprise of everyone. We shall embrace their tactics, taking a new step in the Sikai cavalry doctrine."
 thangoya_1_7_title:0 "Forming New Industries"
 thangoya_1_7_desc:0 "Compared to other areas of the world, Thangoya doesn't offer many luxury materials. While the northern Townships stand out with their local metallurgy and Khanvuphaim establishments, the only thing the south can really provide to the market is basic products such as food. There is an initiative, spearheaded by Lord of Thirabnir, to divert some of the Republic’s resources into a fund that will help establish new businesses and aid in prospecting initiatives. Perhaps if we do that, we can discover new ways these townships can benefit the country."
 thangoya_1_9_title:0 "Attract the Artisans"
 thangoya_1_9_desc:0 "While our initiatives provided a sufficient base of domestic craftsmen, the larger guilds of the region still shy away from looking in our direction, seemingly discouraged by the lack of proof that investing in the Republic could provide large profits. They have the right to do so, as given our history, we haven’t been a rich country pretty much ever. Until now. We shall prove them wrong and establish our own large establishments that will prove once and for all that our country is worth investing in."
 thangoya_1_10_title:0 "All Citizens Aboard"
 thangoya_1_10_desc:0 "While most of the Republic seems to thrive in the newly found changing environment, some communities were seemingly left behind without any purpose. One of the most influential groups that felt this way were the mage guilds, who found the courage to speak out about it. Even more so, they came to the House of Lords with an established plan, suggesting a new bill to introduce them into construction sites, where they can serve a plethora of assignments, from evocating fire into the forges to material repair and reconstruction.\nAll that’s left is to convene and put it to a vote."
 thangoya_1_11_title:0 "To Forge"
 thangoya_1_11_desc:0 "The hills bordering us and Xianjie are known for their large reserves of metals, especially copper and silver. The extraction of these have been the first and foremost export of the Sikai since the long forgotten dawn of the first kingdom. When our country prospered, so did the metallurgic magnates, profiteering as the top of the social ladder, as they have always lobbied in the best interest of the state. It’s time for the state to give them something back. We shall provide them with proper representation and privileges, giving them the ability to fully profit off their industry as the foremost example of success in the republic"

 thangoya_2_5_title:0 "Funnel the Xia"
 thangoya_2_5_desc:0 "The spirit of Xianjie is far from its unwavering status quo. The brutality and cunning of the Hobgoblin Command, combined with their recent sweep of the Shamakhad prompted panic in the wider Xiaken population, many of them losing faith in the Wulin and escaping into realms further away from the frontlines. While many of them have already escaped into the Republic’s borders, our lands can provide a safe haven for thousands more. We shall make use of the connections that link us with the Sikai living there to advertise ourselves, while giving them a proper show of strength and faith, so that they know we are a country that they can feel safe in."
 thangoya_2_6_title:0 "Contesting the Wulin"
 thangoya_2_6_desc:0 "With the Great Command making their first steps into Xianjie, it becomes clear that armies of the Xiaken are no match to the monstrous armies of Hobgoblins. Their armies now march slowly into Xiadao, ready to lay siege on its fortress and break the Wulin’s hold over the Xiaken, which will inevitably leave a massive power vacuum behind. We have to be first to take advantage of this unique timing and save as many Xiaken from the Hobgoblins as possible, providing them with firm, but fair treatment, so that the spirit of Xianjie can remain under the patronship of the Republic."
 thangoya_2_8_title:0 "Finishing the Fundaments"
 thangoya_2_8_desc:0 "When the delegation of Ozovari engineers came, we thought that we were prepared for a long and gruesome argument. Fortunately the dwarves turned out to be quite patient with our shortcomings and even if they were a tad bit prideful, their guidance proved to be eye-opening for most of the Republic’s cabinet. What came out of it was a plan providing small optimisations to practically every town and village in Thangoya, that managed to perform incredibly well and least to say, that the House of Lords wants these meetings to become a standard practice for the Republic."
 thangoya_2_9_title:0 "Silver Net"
 thangoya_2_9_desc:0 "The Golden Highway is the greatest infrastructural project ever built in the world, providing uncountable amounts of trade routes that form the lifeline of the Bulwar-Haless trans-continental trade. While our capabilities are nowhere close to those of its Phoenix Empire builders, we are lucky to house some of the architects and logisticians who helped in managing the construction of this marvel. We shall use their expertise to make our own fully modernized infrastructural system, one that will fill the needs of connecting many large and small settlements, but also designed with future expansion in mind, both inwards and outwards."
 thangoya_2_10_title:0 "To Feed"
 thangoya_2_10_desc:0 "For many years, grain and livestock exports were the backbone of the poorer townships, consistently having an abundance of food as there were not many mouths to eat in the first place. Traditionally, it was the army’s role to guard the granaries and other warehouses in time of peace, but much to our surprise, the Republic stands at a point where these granaries are slowly emptying with each year. As much as unprecedented this is, the solution seems obvious and beneficial to all parties involved. More farms to produce goods, more farmers to manage said farms, more warehouses to store said goods and more soldiers to guard that god blessed grain!"
 thangoya_2_12_title:0 "The Sikai Metropolis"
 thangoya_2_12_desc:0 "Some of our ancestors wouldn’t believe in what they would see today. Large towns housing tens if not hundreds of thousands people, hosting markets of products from across the continent. Huge carriages carrying freshly made bronze tools, through a silver coated road. Vast fields of golden grass spanning from horizon to horizon upon which farmers earn their day’s pay. We came a long way from the dawn of the Republic to what we have now, but we can rest assured that we can no longer call ourselves poor or frowned upon. \nWe are as rich as the magnates of Kharunyana, as numerous as the cities of Yanhe and as well managed as the courts of Dhenbasana. We are the citizens of the Sikai Townships and everyone envies our success!"

 thangoya_3_6_title:0 "Silver and Bronze"
 thangoya_3_6_desc:0 "The Silver Shields and the monks of the Unbroken Shield in Lo Pashong have shared simlilar traditions for hundreds of years, passing ideas to each other through their shared border. As the monks of Xia poured into our country, many of them recognized this similarity mistaking or comparing Ngoeni regiments with our brethren across the hills.\nIndeed, it seems like the martial traditions of the monasteries on our border are not that much different than ours. If we integrate them into our army, they should be a useful addition to our arsenal, greatly improving the quality of our soldiers’ close quarters combat."
 thangoya_3_7_title:0 "How To Govern"
 thangoya_3_7_desc:0 "The dwarven holds are perhaps one of the greatest landmarks of the world. A result of hundreds of years of continuous planning, expansion and optimisation, they house whole countries in the depths of a single mountain. It is no wonder that once upon a time, the kings of Verkal Ozovar held control over all Kai, bringing their expertise in exchange for our loyalty, before each of us broke away as fully matured states.\nIronically enough, the same hold now rests as our subjects, grumpy yet loyal, at least for now. Perhaps with some encouragement, we can win them over, so they can provide some of their experience once again to improve our long-term planning, just like the old times."
 thangoya_3_9_title:0 "Bartering with Sikhawlom"
 thangoya_3_9_desc:0 "Sikhawlom is a peculiar place. A barren desert, standing between lush and fertile grasslands of Hukai and Telebei, with no physical reason why it would be this inhabitable. \nThe druidic circles of Phudban have been researching this wasteland for a long time and came up with a hypothesis - It seems like this particular place attracts many grieving spirits, whose tears contaminate the soil, killing off any plant that would live there. Perhaps with the resources that the Republic has now, they may calm or perhaps banish these unwanted guests, making the land hospitable… or at least not hostile."
 thangoya_3_10_title:0 "City of Adventurers"
 thangoya_3_10_desc:0 "Haiban has for the longest time been the center of Sikai trade, serving as a hub for many packs of adventurers, who did not appreciate the bureaucratic and political approach of Lot Dekkhangi Daulophs, while exporting massive amounts of food downstream into more populous cities of the continent. \nUnfortunately as time went on, the importance of Haiban started to wane, slowly losing influence in favour of monopolising measures of Lot Dekkhang. The city needs to reassure itself as the marketplace for more amateur, unorganised bands, by the introduction of massive bounties for domestic companies. Who knows, maybe pulling a couple of strings could pull the attention of the Dishonoured into our embrace?"
 thangoya_3_11_title:0 "To Clothe"
 thangoya_3_11_desc:0 "The splendour of a society is dependent on the amount of luxuries and art they can afford. While we can provide plenty of them at this point in the form of valuable metals and textile industries, our products still can't reliably break through even in local markets, due to preexisting monopolies of Raheni Silk plantators who outcompete our products through both backdoor deals and the availability of their products. In this situation, expanding our output and improving the quality simply won't do enough. If we want our textiles to truly succeed we need to replace the backdoor monopolies with state-enforced ones, that will ensure a stable market for our domestic products."
 thangoya_3_13_title:0 "An Army of Seven Races"
 thangoya_3_13_desc:0 "As the Republic expanded into its current state, it adapted to defeat any problem that stood in the way of its ambitions. Unfortunately, some aspects of it had flaws that did not were not gravely detrimental and thus remained unhandled, despite causing issues. \nThe most grave one of these cases is the structure of the army that still bases itself on Sikai military traditions, mostly influenced by human and elven style of warfare, unfit for some of our citizens, who were nonetheless drafted and forced to fight in an uncomfortable way.\nTo end this discrimination, we have to make a total overhaul of the armed forces, creating specialised racial units that will compliment their unique advantages, while remaining compatible with the majority human units that still form the core of the Republic’s army."

 thangoya_4_5_title:0 "Recovering the Land"
 thangoya_4_5_desc:0 "The wars of unification put the Townships into chaos of an unprecedented scale. With territories changing hands multiple times in the span of such little time, it is no wonder that its people are confused and unsure what their future is going to look like. Before the Republic is able to move on from the Wars of Hiderion, we need to provide reassurance to the common citizen, so that they are aware that Thangoya is there to stay and support their needs."
 thangoya_4_6_title:0 "Turning Tables"
 thangoya_4_6_desc:0 "Ever since our revolt under the mantle of the first Sikai Kingdom, our relations with the Nephrite Dwarves never fully recovered. While the flow of goods and people stays normal compared to the rest of our neighbours, the Kings of Verkal Ozovar stay vigilant in their effort to call themselves the sovereign of all Kai people, looking down on the independent human states. How ironic it is now that they're backed into a corner, trying to show a glimpse of relevance in the War for the Mantle of Baihon Xinh. Unfortunately for them, this intervention leaves them vulnerable should a third party intervene and liberate their last line of defense in the form of our oppressed Hinphat brethren."
 thangoya_4_8_title:0 "People Without a State"
 thangoya_4_8_desc:0 "The Phonan have been long living under the oppression of the Khom regime of Baihon Xinh, which consistently gatekept them from obtaining any important positions under many layers of deeply rooted nepotism. Despite the attempts to Khom-ify their culture, they proved that they are people of distinct identity, one suppressed but nonetheless present even now as the Mo Hoang rebels struggled in communicating with their majority Phonan levies. Now that Baihon Xinh is left weak after the civil war, we should take them into our fold and give them the ability to cultivate their culture, so it can flourish once again under the mantle of the Republic."
 thangoya_4_9_title:0 "Gate To Thidinkai"
 thangoya_4_9_desc:0 "Throughout most of its history, the port of Cay Cam Sinh has been used to fuel selfish ambitions of the Baihon Xinh, whose “family values” and “traditional structures” directly translated into every single position of power being held by the relatives of the ruling dynasty.\nNow look at where it led them. They are cornered, desperately trying to shout commands, basically detached from reality in their palaces, as even the port now lies in the hands of the Pirate Queen of Pinghoi. It would serve the greater good to get rid of both of these self-imposed tyrants once and for all and make way for a new system to take their place. One that will reward the people for standing out, rather than bashing them for not sticking to the hierarchy."
 thangoya_4_10_title:0 "Under New Management"
 thangoya_4_10_desc:0 "While conquering the Kai is a great undertaking in itself, we are fully aware that empires unlike ours have fallen as easily as they rose, unable to establish a new status quo. If we want to truly drive away the bias against us from the people we conquered, we have to establish a new standard, one that people can accept and cultivate even after we inevitably fall. The Harimari communities, bearing the legacy of the Harimraj, are known as the administrators of great empires across the whole continent. We shall employ their expertise in managing diverse arrays of people, to establish a complete, fair and unbiased law codex that will shape the society according to the principles of the Republic."
 thangoya_4_12_title:0 "Thidinkai United"
 thangoya_4_12_desc:0 "What was once in the hands of a few, now belongs to the Republic and its representatives, hailing from the many cultures that live there. No longer is the power centered around one person or a city or a race or any other privileged caste that enforces its will through nothing else but force. \nThis new social contract, while already bearing fruits, has not yet fully seeded itself in our society. We have to double down on enforcing the Republic’s virtues, rooting out any oversight, bias or any other abuse of power in our system, so everyone knows that our country is a safe space for everyone."

 thangoya_5_5_title:0 "Steelbound Lords"
 thangoya_5_5_desc:0 "The Methnikhren of Lot Dekkhang have been a longstanding threat against the Townships and their recent attempt at subjugating Khao Elnak shows that they are only getting bolder in their ambitions, seeing our lands as a valuable asset. Thus, the Republic stands at a crossroads. We can fully decouple from their influences and declare them as one more enemy of the state, but we can also fully embrace their domination as their loyal subject… maybe we can even use some of Khao Elnak’s connections and turn Daulophs against each other, sparking a civil war in which we can intervene."
 thangoya_5_6_title:0 "Secure the Middle Course"
 thangoya_5_6_desc:0 "Many would dub the lands in the upper Hukai and Telebei the "Breadbasket of Haless" and rightfully so. The rivers provide plenty of fertile land that provide food for tons of people across the continent. While we were fractured, we weren't able to fully cherish the benefits of this trade, as our profit margin was split in between middlemen who transported the goods downstream. Right now we are large enough to reduce the amount of middlemen by reigning in some countries down the rivers, significantly improving the Republic's influence over trade."
 thangoya_5_7_title:0 "First Kai State"
 thangoya_5_7_desc:0 "The Unbreakable Kai are known for the unity of their people and faith in their state. Their country's history is something they take great pride in, stemming from the ancient revolt against the Nephrite Dwarves of Verkal Ozovar as the first among the Kai to do so, leading as an example for the rest, including us, to follow suit. Even now, we can’t lie and admire their regime, the only one apart from us to elect their rulers, rather than planting a blood-relative and calling it a day. Yet unfortunately, they are also incredibly self-centered and no less entitled than the other monarchs of this continent. If we want to secure their support for the Republic, we need to overcome their stubborn desire to preserve Kudet Kai and unfortunately as much as we would like to deny it, there might be only one way to do that…"
 thangoya_5_9_title:0 "Heavy Duty Cavalry"
 thangoya_5_9_desc:0 "The most distant of the Kai relative to us, the Binhrung society can come by as radically different from what other citizens would imagine. Their country is a matriarchy, favouring women over men in positions of power, which while unique, is still a discrimination we will have to uproot. But there is one more reason that the Republic is looking to acquire those lands. The mines of Keoaden provide gemstones of immense value, that not only provide wealth when trading with the Treasure Fleet, but also protect Binhrung armies as the vital part of their unique armour.\nThat protection, while way too expensive to field an entire army with, could take our cavalry to the next level, as the elite horses and decades of experience would combine with impenetrable armor, creating an unstoppable force that everyone will fear."
