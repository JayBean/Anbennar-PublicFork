    #1st Column - early
    freemarches_into_the_valley_title:0 "Into the Valley"
    freemarches_into_the_valley_desc:0 "Our people, fleeing cruel slavers, must settle in this cursed forest for lack of other options. But nearby lies the Ynn River valley, a much more hospitable land inhabited by elves that survived in Aelantir all these centuries. We should map out this valley and see if any of the Ynnic states are open to an alliance." #By TA31
    freemarches_resources_to_trade_title:0 "Resources to Trade"
    freemarches_resources_to_trade_desc:0 "With the blockade by Amacimst disrupting trade and halting our ambitions, we need to start developing a trapping industry to bolster our economy. This will allow us to fund a military force and end this accursed blockade forever!" #By Alcaz
    #2nd Column - Early
    freemarches_diplomatic_outreach_title:0 "Diplomatic Outreach"
    freemarches_diplomatic_outreach_desc:0 "We are isolated both diplomatically and economically by Amacimst; this situation must be rectified immediately! We should reach out to countries in the Ynn, not only for trade opportunities, but also in order to get their word that once we are ready to take on Amacimst, they won't interfere."
    freemarches_access_to_market_title:0 "Access to Market"
    freemarches_access_to_market_desc:0 "The embargo by Amacimst has been a thorn in our side for too long. With our successful diplomacy and guarantees of non-interference from the riverlords, now is the time to take the fight directly to Amacimst! When we smash down their petty castles and lay waste to their fields they will finally learn why the Cannorians fear the ferocity of the half-orcs!" #By Alcaz
    #3rd Column - Early
    freemarches_the_cursed_heart_title:0 "The Cursed Heart"
    freemarches_the_cursed_heart_desc:0 "The confluence of the Zarmynn and Zabrynn rivers would be excellent as a trading hub for hunters and trappers heading upriver. We must establish a settlement to bring this spot under control. The trappers are already calling it the \"Cursed Heart\" in 'honour' of the forest's dangers." #By TA31
    freemarches_the_meeting_of_rivers_title:0 "The Meeting of Rivers"
    freemarches_the_meeting_of_rivers_desc:0 "Cursed Heart's economy is booming as the fur trade grows, but the town itself is little more than a trading post and some lean-tos. With investment and planned development, we will turn it into a proper city— no longer a curse, but a Free Heart!" #By TA31
    freemarches_a_safe_haven_beckons_title:0 "A Safe Haven Beckons"
    freemarches_a_safe_haven_beckons_desc:0 "While we have achieved freedom in Aelantir, our Orc brothers and sisters in Cannor remain in chains, many enslaved for crimes they are too young to remember. We should build an underground network of smugglers and human traffickers and begin transporting escaped slaves to our colonies - this is not only the right thing to do but will also give us much needed manpower." #by Alcaz
    freemarches_the_freemarches_title:0 "The Freemarches"
    freemarches_the_freemarches_desc:0 "We have etched out the bare bones of a nation amongst the towering pines and ever changing rivers of the forest. We have begun to realise the dream of Varbuk, but there is much work yet to be done."
    #4th Column - Early
    freemarches_the_forest_edges_title:0 "The Forest Edges"
    freemarches_the_forest_edges_desc:0 "The edges of the Forest of the Cursed Ones are by far the safest part of the region. The Cursed Ones have had their numbers thinned by the frequent patrols of Amethyst Knights of Amacimst. There are clearings where berries and fruits are more available and the winters here are less harsh and more forgiving. It will take work, but if we can carve out villages and farms in these parts, we can build a community."  #By TA31
    freemarches_half_orcs_of_the_forest_title:0 "Half-orcs of the Forest"
    freemarches_half_orcs_of_the_forest_desc:0 "The first generation of our country is growing up, one that has never known life outside the Cursed Forest. They learn from childhood how to make their fortunes in this rooted soil, how to fight amongst the trees and how to smell a Cursed One on the wind. It is heartening to see our people rise to this challenge; we are victims no longer!" #By TA31
    #5th Column - Early
    freemarches_a_new_avatar_title:0 "A New Avatar"
    freemarches_a_new_avatar_desc:0 "At first few believed the reports of Muroga… such a miracle in the Freemarches? It seemed like divine intervention was meant for far off places of import. But as the Peace of Muroga carried on, and the Cursed Ones seemed to have completely disappeared from the forest, more were convinced that Falah had directly intervened in the Freemarches and that Muroga was her Avatar. By the time the Peace ended, belief in Muroga’s divinity was very widely held. We should formalise her status as an Avatar in our nation and recognize her in temples throughout our land."
    freemarches_a_new_avatar_tt:0 "Wait for a miracle."
    
    #1st Column - Established - Ynn
    freemarches_defending_against_the_riverlords_title:0 "Defending Against the Riverlords"
    freemarches_defending_against_the_riverlords_desc:0 "While our increased trade and talks with the Riverlords have bought us time, we know that they covet our resources and seek dominion over the Ynn. We must fortify our borders and set up a defensive line for when that time comes." #by Alcaz
    freemarches_defending_against_the_riverlords_tt:0 "Reduces the maintenance on our new forts."
    freemarches_armed_neutrality_title:0 "Armed Neutrality"
    freemarches_armed_neutrality_desc:0 "Unlike other powers in the Ynn we are completely alone, a foreign people in a foreign land. Our status as escaped slaves and half-orc refugees does not endear us to even the other Cannorians. We expect that conflict is on the horizon; we should preempt this and start building up a standing army to bolster our already fortified borders." #by Alcaz
    freemarches_lordling_adventurers_title:0 "Lordling Adventurers"
    freemarches_lordling_adventurers_desc:0 "Since the institution of the Rudmen started, it has been a role almost exclusively occupied by half-orcs. However the trade has left some Rudmen very wealthy, and such wealth draws fortune seekers. Increasingly those seeking to join the Rudmen have been coming from the ruinborn of the Ynn, often dismissively called \"lordlings\" by Freemarchers.\nSome Rudmen captains have welcomed the lordlings to their teams, their knowledge of the Ynnic customs and language proving useful during the process of selling the furs. However the Rudmen themselves are far more hostile to their new teammates. They cite Varbuk's dream, a nation \"For Half-orcs, by Half-orcs\", and know that the ruinborn welcomed them to this continent at the tip of armoured lancer’s spear."
    
    #1st Column - Established - Cursed Ones
    freemarches_understanding_our_enemy_title:0 "Understanding Our Enemy"
    freemarches_understanding_our_enemy_desc:0 "The Cursed Ones are still largely a mystery to us. They are clearly capable of speech, but amongst themselves they act silently and in unison, working with uncanny coordination. We are not great mages or artificers, but we should found an institution dedicated to the study of our great enemy. We cannot match the strength of the Cursed Ones, but perhaps through knowledge we can gain the upper hand."
    
    #2nd Column - Established - Cursed Ones
    freemarches_rudmen_guards_title:0 "Rudmen Guards"
    freemarches_rudmen_guards_desc:0 "Any rudman that makes it to the end of their career has picked up skills that would make them excellent guards of outlying villages: how to detect Cursed Ones in the area, how to quickly build fortifications, how to live off the forest without supplies. We should encourage these retired rudmen to disperse themselves amongst the villages, leading their defence and advising local leaders. Perhaps a plot of land and a pension would entice them?"
    freemarches_hunting_the_hunters_title:0 "Hunting the Hunters"
    freemarches_hunting_the_hunters_desc:0 "For too long we have been on the back foot with the Cursed Ones. Our towns and villages are mere outposts, surrounded by territory that the Cursed Ones navigate freely. It’s time to push them back, make the forests secure for our own to travel without fear. It’s a lofty goal, and we will need to engage many adventurers in this cause."
    freemarches_hunting_the_hunters_tt:0 "5 units in the Forest of the Cursed Ones will perish in the hunt."
    freemarches_gnomish_innovation_title:0 "Gnomish Innovation"
    freemarches_gnomish_innovation_desc:0 "We have gotten word from our spies that a Gnome has discovered something about the cursed ones infamous \"kinbond\", that which allows them to coordinate with each other without speech, attacking in devastating highly coordinated formations that can move as a single unit without any clear direction or command. This knowledge could be exactly what we need to gain an edge against our endless conflict with the cursed ones. We should seek out this Gnome and \"persuade\" him, either through bribery or force, to tell us what he knows." #by Alcaz
    freemarches_bond_breaker_title:0 "Bond Breaker"
    freemarches_bond_breaker_desc:0 "The gnomes have made a breakthrough: a machine that disrupts the \"kinbond,\" the silent link that Cursed Ones use to communicate with each other. The only problem is its size; it currently takes up the better part of a room, and there's no way to transport it through the forest. Our artificers believe that they may be able to reduce it to a handheld device, but they will need significant financing to purchase parts from the finest artificers in Cannor and Haless."
    freemarches_the_bond_breaker_tt:0 "Unlocks the §YBond Breaker§! privilege for the §YArtificers§! estate."
    freemarches_into_the_forest_once_more_title:0 "Into the Forest Once More"
    freemarches_into_the_forest_once_more_desc:0 "With the Bond Breaker in hand, we have made huge progress against the Cursed Ones. However as Freemarchers begin to sleep easily for the first time since arriving in the forest, the minds behind the Bond Breaker have turned to new questions. How does this telepathic communication work? How did the Cursed Ones acquire such an ability? They have begun agitating for an expedition into the heart of the Cursed One Territory, the mountains to the south, to follow the traces of their legends and find the Source of the Kinbond! "
    
    #3rd Column - Established - Rudmen Expansion
    freemarches_into_the_dark_of_the_forest_title:0 "Into the Dark of the Forest"
    freemarches_into_the_dark_of_the_forest_desc:0 "The Rudmen have become an essential group in the Freemarches: teams of fur trappers and traders who venture deep into the Forest of the Cursed Ones by canoe, where they are vulnerable to attack by Cursed Ones, foreigners and the wildlife of the forest. We must formally claim their routes for ourselves, to support and nurture this growing industry."
    freemarches_bankside_redoubts_title:0 "Bankside Redoubts"
    freemarches_bankside_redoubts_desc:0 "We must do more to protect the Rudmen. With a few simple redoubts along the Zarmynn and Zabrynn we can create a safe haven for Rudmen: places to stop, trade and resupply. Safe harbour in case of a large Cursed One raiding party, military bases to send patrols along the river. We cannot protect the entire Ynn, but the Rudmen are hardy, and this will do much to help them."
    freemarches_breaking_through_to_the_sea_title:0 "Through to the Sea"
    freemarches_breaking_through_to_the_sea_desc:0 "We have long ventured on the Ynn river's tributaries whilst plying our wares, but there is another option. The Cadderoy river in the northeast is well-suited for exporting to Cannor and the coastal colonies. We need to seize the land around the river as well as its mouth at Erdewah. No longer will our merchants fear Ynnic arrogance!" #By TA31
    freemarches_the_grand_haul_title:0 "The Grand Haul"
    freemarches_the_grand_haul_desc:0 "In the northern reaches of the forest, there is a tantalisingly small gap between the Cadderoy basin and the northern tip of Lake Drahr - only 40 miles. This gap between the Ynn and Cadderoy rivers presents both a challenge and an opportunity for daring Rudmen.\nThe Rudmen are known for their remarkable portaging skills, as they carry their canoes, supplies, furs, and trade goods across this gap on foot. However, this feat is not for the faint-hearted, for they are vulnerable to attacks by the Cursed Ones.\nTo mitigate the risk, the Rudmen prefer to undertake this treacherous journey twice a year - in the spring and autumn - when their numbers are large, and their chances of success are high. The portage takes on the air of a grand festival, with trading, drinking, and catching up with old friends at the end of the gruelling journey. It is a time of great celebration, where the Rudmen trade their prized furs for Cannorian and Halessi manufactured goods.\nThis unique and fascinating tradition is a testament to Rudmen resilience and resourcefulness. It is a practice that deserves our support and encouragement, for it not only helps to sustain their way of life but also contributes to the growth and development of the province."
    freemarches_varbuks_dream_title:0 "Varbuk's Dream"
    freemarches_varbuks_dream_desc:0 "The half-orcs have suffered more than any others. But despite our enslavement, despite the hatred and hostility from outsiders, despite being forced into this cursed forest because we had nowhere else to go— we have triumphed! We have prospered! No-one else could have built what we have built! Our founder dreamed of a nation \"by half-orcs, for half-orcs\", and now we shall ensure that our half-orcs are never threatened again!" #By TA31
    
    #4th Column - Established
    freemarches_ichor_of_the_forest_title:0 "Ichor of the Forest"
    freemarches_ichor_of_the_forest_desc:0 "A strange liquid has been found flowing from our trees; thought to be a disease or something magical at first, some brave Rudmen have tasted it. Finding it delicious and sweet they have begun to harvest trees specifically to find more of it. We should capitalise on this and start sponsoring foresters to harvest the ichor and begin to sell it abroad. This could be the start of a whole new industry!" #by Alcaz
    freemarches_reach_out_to_grombar_title:0 "Reach Out to Grombar"
    freemarches_reach_out_to_grombar_desc:0 "The nation of Grombar, back in Cannor, would be an excellent ally for us. They are tough, they are bold, they are fellow half-orcs and they know what it's like to be spat upon by those imperious southerners. We should send out diplomatic envoys and attempt to bring this natural alliance into being." #by TA31
    freemarches_the_gray_guard_title:0 "The Gray Guard"
    freemarches_the_gray_guard_desc:0 "For obvious reasons, our nation is a very popular destination for Grombari immigrants to Aelantir. The veterans and adventurers among them bring a wealth of information on modern military tactics. We should organise the skilled newcomers into a special military unit so that we can make full use of their valuable knowledge. " #by TA31
    
    #5th Column - Established - Religious
    freemarches_temples_to_falah_title:0 "Temples to Falah"
    freemarches_temples_to_falah_desc:0 "Falah has clearly presented Herself as our patron deity. Typically Freemachers have tended to build small shrines or humble chapels to the gods. We must build great temples to Falah to show our reverence and devotion to her."
    freemarches_murogafest_title:0 "Murogafest"
    freemarches_murogafest_desc:0 "Each year Freemarchers celebrate Murogafest, in honour of Muroga and her patron, Falah. The festival is a time for celebration, drinking, storytelling, and competition.\nThe festival provides an opportunity for people from different walks of life to come together and celebrate their shared heritage. Participants tell stories of Muroga's bravery and cunning, and some even claim to have seen the avatar herself.\nTowns and villages across the Freemarches are deck themselves out in bright banners and decoration. A day of drinking, merrymaking and storytelling ends with a great feast. Various forest delicacies are served: roast boar, elderberry scones with pinecone jam, goose stuffed with wild mushrooms.\nWe should encourage this festival and put the full weight of the state behind it."
    freemarches_twelfth_pantheonic_council_title:0 "Twelfth Pantheonic Council"
    freemarches_twelfth_pantheonic_council_desc:0 "We should host a grand Pantheonic Council so that the temples of the Regent Court will recognize Muroga's divinity. We will invite priests from all across Cannor to Free Heart, and surely they will see the light of our arguments.\n[Converting to Ravelianism might provide an easier way to honour Muroga!]" #by TA31
    freemarches_saint_muroga_title:0 "Saint Muroga"
    freemarches_saint_muroga_desc:0 "The Ravelian Church, thankfully, has a somewhat more amenable view on canonization than certain other religions. In order to get Blessed Muroga recognized as a Ravelian saint, we need to both curry favour with the High Rectorate and gain the support of our brother nations in faith. After that we can send a formal delegation to the Rectorate's capital." #by TA31
    
    #5th Column - Established - Conquest
    freemarches_our_forest_title:0 "Our Forest"
    freemarches_our_forest_desc:0 "This forest is certainly not a loving or hospitable place. But we have prospered off its wealth, and if others cut in on the market, our economy would be threatened. The entire Forest of the Cursed Ones must be brought under Freemarcher control to secure our way of life." #by TA31
    freemarches_in_search_of_more_furs_title:0 "In Search of More Furs"
    freemarches_in_search_of_more_furs_desc:0 "Furs, furs, furs! Mink, giant beaver, logrkroz— they are our lifeblood, and half-orcs' strength makes us the best at securing them in these harsh lands. The coastal land of Themaria is a valuable hunting ground, and we are clearly more entitled to it than any feeble competitors!" #By TA31
    freemarches_best_served_cold_title:0 "Best Served Cold"
    freemarches_best_served_cold_desc:0 "The slave-hub of Dalaire is scum on the earth. It is where our ancestors were shoved ashore after being ripped from Cannor. Where they were bought and sold like cattle. And where the founders of the Freemarches escaped from so long ago. Now we are a strong nation, and yet they still grow rich on blood-soaked coins. We must end this cruelty and free our brothers. Dalaire will burn!" #By TA31
    freemarches_our_north_title:0 "Our North"
    freemarches_our_north_desc:0 "What are the Freemarches? A place of liberty, community, and honest work for honest living. What are the colonies around us? Wretches and parasites, plundering the land and pumping money to slavers— if not slavers themselves. Clearly, it is our rule that must extend over the entire North. One is either with us, or with the slavers." #By TA31

    flavor_freemarches.2.d:0 "Reports of an extraordinary, divine occurrence are coming in from Misty Fell. They tell of a Cursed One attack on an outlying village, all souls either slaughtered or fled. When the nearby garrison rallied to lead a counter attack, they witnessed a miracle. Muroga, the local priestess of Falah, emerged from the small village temple, a Cursed One spear through her heart and wielding the Falah's flaming bow.\n\nShe cried to the garrison \"Falah has released me back onto this world to slay the wicked and hunt the hunters! Come boys, let us ensnare this foul game!\"\n\nWith her flaming bow, she easily drove the Cursed Ones back into the forest. Before she gave chase, she stopped to give the captain of the garrison the spear that she pulled from her heart. The captain reportedly stood their agape for several minutes, as she disappeared into the forest.Turning to his men, he held the spear aloft, Muroga's heartsblood still dripping down its shaft, and shouted \"For the Freemarches! For Falah! For Muroga!\""
    flavor_freemarches.2.a:0 "A blessing from Falah!"
    
    flavor_freemarches.3.t:0 "The Peace of Muroga"
    flavor_freemarches.3.d:0 "While some were sceptical of the reports of Muroga, none are now. It has been exactly 1 year since the Miracle of Muroga and since then there hasn't been a single Cursed One sighting, nevermind an attack. Freemarchers are not sure how to deal with the new status quo, whether now is the time for bold inroads into the Forest of the Cursed Ones, or if they will be left over extended and exposed if (or when) the Cursed Ones return.  For now, all Freemarchers are thanking the Gods for this reprieve."

Ten years of peace are over, and the resumption of the war against the Cursed Ones has left the capital a very melancholic place.\n\nMeanwhile, some are encouraging the populace to be glad the peace happened, as well as to celebrate Falah and Muroga. They're even calling for Muroga to be officially recognized as an Avatar of Falah!"
    flavor_freemarches.4.a:0 "The peace is over..."
  
    flavor_freemarches.5.t:0 "An Ambush!"
    flavor_freemarches.5.d.1:0 "The morning was bright and fresh as a band of Freemarcher settlers stepped out of the darkness of the forest into a clearing.

The pair, dressed in tattered and muddy Rectoral robes, looked up at the mighty edifice, where statues of the major Saints stared back down at them. Argor stood, mouth agape, awed that man could build such a monument. Batur, irrepressible as always, simply slapped his travelling companion on the shoulder and said \"Come brother, soon enough she will be up there with them!\" as he strode into the mighty hall.\n\nThis was, of course, some months after a passionate discussion with the Provost, on the subject of the canonization of Muroga the Huntress. Their congregants had been strongly in favour and had asked the two half-orc Rectors to raise it. When the Provost, who was already three quarters of an hour late for lunch, had grunted, \"If you feel so strongly about it, I suggest you take it up with the High Rector,\" Argor and Batur had decided they would do just that.\n\nTheir journey had been a long one; they had received enough from their congregations to secure passage on a fur trading ship, bound for Anbenncóst. They had endeared themselves to their shipmates by always being a spare pair of hands - if a deck needed scrubbing or a stew needed cooking, the Rectors were there. During a particularly bad storm, Batur saved the life of a man who was pinned by fallen rigging. Using his colossal strength, the half-orc Rector managed to lift the beam as his crew mates freed the man. He attempted to show his gratitude by treating the Rector to an evening in \"the best brothel in Silverdocks\". Batur politely declined.\n\nIn Anbenncóst they were forced to rely on the charity of others to gather funds for the journey to the High Rectorate. In amongst their street sermons they would tell the story of Muroga to anyone who would listen. The pair intended to save the crowns they were given for their journey onwards, but as they began to know the orcs and half-orcs of Anbenncóst, Argor argued that \"Muroga would not wish us to work for her glory when there are those here who need her protection.\" So every crown they collected went to feeding the poor of Silverdocks. It was not until a retired Chipped Tooth Company captain, rich from plundering the Ynn, heard their story and promised to support the poor in their place, that they we able to complete their journey to the High Rectorate."

Argor and Batur were confused, as they had no idea what this summoning might mean. As they stood in front of the desk, the High Rector looked up at them and grumbled.\n\n\"For a year now, not a day has gone by where I’ve not heard of the two Half-orcs from who-knows-where and their quest. If it’s not from my attendants, it’s from the Veridicals, if it’s not from them it’s from pilgrims.

By the time we got to him, half his body had been eaten away.\n\nMany of the camp have also begun to have terrible nightmares, which are also extracting their toll on morale. The only one who seems unaffected is the gnomish leader, Obran Orannam, who swears that he has had a dream of a Tower, to our south. He claims that inside this tower there is a solitary elf, hard at work, and that this elf must know the secrets of the Kinbond.\n\nIt is the best lead we have to our goal, and we were ordered to take the gnomes where they need to go. However, south of our location is a blizzard. We’ve seen it since we descended the mountains, it seems as wide as the wastes themselves, and it has neither stopped nor abated during our time in the wastes. "

We’ve found no source of game, and our nearest drinkable water source is back in the mountains.\n\nIn addition these nightmares will not abate, they make our dreams even more unpleasant than being awake out here. Half-orcs and gnomes continue to wander off at night; we tracked one’s footprints to the edge of the blizzard. Something in there is drawing them inwards.\n\nObran continues to barrage me every day about leading an expedition into the blizzard. Says that staying here is suicide, and we must either brave it or leave the wastes for home. Given the state of our supplies, I suspect he is not wrong."

Fewer than half of those that departed arrived with us to find nothing. An expanse of snowbanks, rolling across the landscape.\n\nUpon finding this place Obran began exclaiming that he had found the source of the kinbond and the Cursed Ones, and that he could see \"The Great Laboratory\". He then immediately began digging around in the snow, but no one could determine what he was looking for, nor what he could see in the storm.\n\nI thought him mad, but as I surveyed the eye I could swear I saw Ratak in the storm wall."

I'm not sure what we have that will be of use, but others will get to know our story and our journey. I hope something worthwhile will come from this…"

As they crossed the mountains, they found evidence of a rudmen camp, and nearby, the body of a rudman captain. In his pockets, they found a logbook, and in his fist, a strange stone.\n\nHis logbook details how, when his men attempted to arrest Obram Orannam, the gnome grabbed a rock from the snow and smacked a rudman across the head with it. The gnome then ran off into the blizzard, leaving the rock behind.\n\nThe survivors then attempted to escape the blizzard and cross back into the Freemarches, but they only got as far as the mountains, before being caught in yet another snowstorm.\n\nIn the hand of the rudman captain was a strange tablet, presumably the rock from the eye of the blizzard. Strange symbols tracked across its surface."
