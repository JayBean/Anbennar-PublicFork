    freemarches_into_the_valley_title:0 "Into the Valley"
    freemarches_into_the_valley_desc:0 "Our people, fleeing cruel slavers, must settle in this cursed forest for lack of other options. But nearby lies the Ynn River valley, a much more hospitable land inhabitated by elves that survived in Aelantir all these centuries. We should map out this valley and see if any of the Ynnic states are open to an alliance." #By TA31
    freemarches_resources_to_trade_title:0 "Resources to Trade"
    freemarches_resources_to_trade_desc:0 "With the blockade by Amacimst disrupting trade and halting our ambitions, we need to start developing a trapping industry to bolster our economy in order to fund a military force to end this accursed blockade forever!" #By Alcaz
    #2nd Column - Early
    freemarches_diplomatic_outreach_title:0 "Diplomatic Outreach"
    freemarches_diplomatic_outreach_desc:0 "We are isolated both diplomatically and economically by Amacimst, this situation must be rectified immeditaly! We should reach out to countries in the Ynn, not only for trade opportunities, but in order to get their word that once we are ready to take on Amacimst they won't interfere."
    freemarches_access_to_market_title:0 "Access to Market"
    freemarches_access_to_market_desc:0 "The embargo by Amacimst has been a thorn in our side for too long, with our sucessful diplomacy and guarantees of non-interference from the riverlords now is the time to take the fight directly to Amacimst! When we smash down their petty castles and lay waste to their fields they will finally learn why the Cannorians fear the ferocity of the half-orcs!" #By Alcaz
    #3rd Column - Early
    freemarches_the_cursed_heart_title:0 "The Cursed Heart"
    freemarches_the_cursed_heart_desc:0 "The confluence of the Zarmynn and Zabrynn rivers would be excellent for a trading hub for hunters and trappers heading upriver. We must establish a settlement to bring this spot under control. The trappers are already calling it the \"Cursed Heart\" in 'honor' of the forest's dangers." #By TA31
    freemarches_the_meeting_of_rivers_title:0 "The Meeting of Rivers"
    freemarches_the_meeting_of_rivers_desc:0 "Cursed Heart's economy is booming as the fur trade grows, but the town itself is little more than a trading post and some lean-tos. With investment and planned development, we will turn it into a proper city— no longer a curse, but a Free Heart!" #By TA31
    freemarches_a_safe_haven_beckons_title:0 "A Safe Haven Beckons"
    freemarches_a_safe_haven_beckons_desc:0 "While we have achieved freedom in Aelantir, our Orc brothers and sisters in Cannor remain in chains, many enslaved for crimes they are too young to remember. We should build a underground network of smugglers and human traffickers and begin transporting escaped slaves to our colonies, this is not only the right thing to do but will also give us much needed manpower. " #by Alcaz
    freemarches_the_freemarches_title:0 "The Freemarches"
    freemarches_the_freemarches_desc:0 "We have etched out the bare bones of a nation amongst the towering pines and ever changing rivers of the forest. We have begun to realize the dream of Varbuk, but there is much work yet to be done. "
    #4th Column - Early
    freemarches_the_forest_edges_title:0 "The Forest Edges"
    freemarches_the_forest_edges_desc:0 "The edges of the Forest of the Cursed Ones are by far the safest part of the region. The Cursed Ones have had their numbers thinned by frequent patrols by the Amethyst Knights of Amacimst. There are clearings where berries and fruits are more available. The winters here are less harsh and more forgiving. It will take work, but if we can carve out villages and farms in these parts, we can carve a community."  #By TA31
    freemarches_half_orcs_of_the_forest_title:0 "Half-orcs of the Forest"
    freemarches_half_orcs_of_the_forest_desc:0 "The first generation of our country is growing up, that has never known life outside the Cursed Forest. They learn from childhood how to make their fortunes in this rooted soil, how to fight amongst the trees and how to smell a Cursed One on the wind. It is heartening to see our people rise to this challenge; we are victims no longer!" #By TA31
    #5th Column - Early
    freemarches_a_new_avatar_title:0 "A New Avatar"
    freemarches_a_new_avatar_desc:0 "At first few believed the reports of Muroga, such a miracle.. in the Freemarches? It seemed like divine intervention was meant for far off places of import. But as the Peace of Muroga carried on, and the Cursed Ones seemed to have completely disappeared from the forest, more were convinced that Falah had directly intervened in the Freemarches and that Muroga was her Avatar. By the time the Peace ended, belief in Muroga’s divinity was very widely held. We should formalize her status as an Avatar in our nation and recognize her in temples throughout our land."
    freemarches_a_new_avatar_tt:0 "Wait for a miracle."
    
    #1st Column - Established - Ynn
    freemarches_defending_against_the_riverlords_title:0 "Defending Against the Riverlords"
    freemarches_defending_against_the_riverlords_desc:0 "While our increased trade and talks with the Riverlords has bought us time, we know that they covet our resources and seek dominion over the Ynn, we must fortify our borders and set up a defensive line for when the time comes" #by Alcaz
    freemarches_armed_neutrality_title:0 "Armed Neutrality"
    freemarches_armed_neutrality_desc:0 "Unlike other powers in the Ynn we are completely alone, a foreign people in a foreign land. Our status as escaped slaves and half orc refugees does not endear us to even the other Cannorians, we expect that conflict is on the horizon, we should preempt this and start building up a standing army to bolster our already fortified borders " #by Alcaz
    freemarches_lordling_adventurers_title:0 "Lordling Adventurers"
    freemarches_lordling_adventurers_desc:0 "Since the institution of the Rudmen started, it has been a role almost exclusively occupied by half-orcs. However the trade has left some Rudmen very wealthy, and such wealth draws fortune seekers. Increasingly those seeking to join the Rudmen have been coming from ruinborn of the Ynn, often dismissively called “lordlings” by Freemarchers.\nSome Rudmen captains have welcomed the lordlings to their teams, their knowledge of the Ynnic customs and language is useful during the process of selling the furs. However the Rudmen themselves are far more hostile to their new teammates. They cite Varbuk's dream, a nation “For Half-orcs, by Half-orcs”, and know that the ruinborn welcomed them to this continent at the tip of armoured lancer’s spear."
    
    #1st Column - Established - Cursed Ones
    freemarches_understanding_our_enemy_title:0 "Understanding Our Enemy"
    freemarches_understanding_our_enemy_desc:0 "The Cursed Ones are still largely a mystery to us. They are clearly capable of speech, but amongst themselves they act silently and in unison, acting with uncanny coordination. We are not great mages or artificers, but we should found an institution dedicated to the study of our great enemy. We cannot match the strength of the Cursed Ones, but perhaps through knowledge we can gain the upper hand."
    
    #2nd Column - Established - Cursed Ones
    freemarches_rudmen_guards_title:0 "Rudmen Guards"
    freemarches_rudmen_guards_desc:0 "Any rudman that makes it to the end of their career has picked up skills that would make them excellent guards of outlying villages. How to detect Cursed Ones in the area, how to quickly build defenses, how to live off the forest without supplies. We should encourage these retired rudmen to disperse themselves amongst the villages, leading their defenses and advising local leaders. Perhaps a plot of land and a pension would entice them"
    freemarches_hunting_the_hunters_title:0 "Hunting the Hunters"
    freemarches_hunting_the_hunters_desc:0 "For too long we have been on the back foot with the Cursed Ones. Our towns a villages are mere outposts, surrounds by territory that the Cursed Ones navigate freely. It’s time to push them back, make the forests secure for our own to travel without fear. It’s a lofty goal, and the we will need to engage many adventurers in this cause."
    freemarches_gnomish_innovation_title:0 "Gnomish Innovation"
    freemarches_gnomish_innovation_desc:0 "We have gotten word from our spies that a Gnome has discovered something about the cursed ones infamous \"kinbond\" that allows them to coordinate with each other without speech, attacking in devastating highly coordinated formations that can move as a single unit without any clear direction or command. This knowledge could be exactly what we need to gain a edge against our endless conflict with the cursed ones. We should seek out this Gnome and \"persuade\" him either through bribery or force to tell us what he knows." #by Alcaz
    freemarches_bond_breaker_title:0 "Bond Breaker"
    freemarches_bond_breaker_desc:0 "The gnomes have made a breakthrough: a machine that disrupts the "kinbond," the silent link that Cursed Ones use to communicate with each other. The only problem is its size; it currently takes up the better part of a room, and there's no way to transport it through the forest. Our artificers believe that they may be able to reduce it to a handheld device, but they will need significant financing to purchase parts from the finest artificers in Cannor and Haless."
    freemarches_the_bond_breaker_tt:0 "Unlocks the §YBond Breaker§! privilege for the §YArtificers§! estate."
    freemarches_into_the_forest_once_more_title:0 "Into the Forest Once More"
    freemarches_into_the_forest_once_more_desc:0 "With the Bond Breaker in hand, we have made huge progress against the Cursed Ones. However as Freemarchers begin to sleep easily for the first time since arriving in the forest, the minds behind the Bond Breaker have turned to new questions. How does this telepathic communication work? How did the Cursed Ones acquire such an ability? They have begun agitating for an expedition into the heart of the Cursed One Territory, the mountains to the south, to follow the traces of their legends to find the Source of the Kinbond! "
    
    #3rd Column - Established - Rudmen Expansion
    freemarches_into_the_dark_of_the_forest_title:0 "Into the Dark of the Forest"
    freemarches_into_the_dark_of_the_forest_desc:0 "The Rudmen have become an essential group in the Freemarches. Teams of fur trappers and traders who venture deep into the Forest of the Cursed Ones by canoe, where they are vulnerable to attack by Cursed Ones, foreigners and the wildlife of the forest. We must formally claim their routes for ourselves, to support and nurture this growing industry."
    freemarches_bankside_redoubts_title:0 "Bankside Redoubts"
    freemarches_bankside_redoubts_desc:0 "We must do more to protect the Rudmen. With a few simple redoubts along the Zarmynn and Zabrynn we can create safe haven for rudmen. Places to stop, trade and resupply. Safe harbour in case of a large Cursed One raiding party. Military bases to send patrols along the river. We cannot protect the entire Ynn, but the Rubmen are hardy, and this will do much to help them."
    freemarches_breaking_through_to_the_sea_title:0 "Through to the Sea"
    freemarches_breaking_through_to_the_sea_desc:0 "We have long ventured on the Ynn river's tributaries while plying our wares, but there is another option. The Cadderoy river in the northeast is well-suited for exporting to Cannor and the coastal colonies. We need to seize the land around the river as well as its mouth at Erdewah. No longer will our merchants fear Ynnic arrogance!" #By TA31
    freemarches_the_grand_haul_title:0 "The Grand Haul"
    freemarches_the_grand_haul_desc:0 "In the northern reaches of the forest, there is a tantalizingly small gap between the Cadderoy basin and the northern tip of Lake Drahr - only 40 miles. This gap between the Ynn and Cadderoy rivers presents both a challenge and an opportunity for daring Rudmen.\nThe Rudmen are known for their remarkable portaging skills, as they carry their canoes, supplies, furs, and trade goods across this gap on foot. However, this feat is not for the faint-hearted, for they are vulnerable to attacks by the Cursed Ones.\nTo mitigate the risk, the Rudmen prefer to undertake this treacherous journey twice a year - in the spring and autumn - when their numbers are large, and their chances of success are high. The portage takes on the air of a grand festival, with trading, drinking, and catching up with old friends at the end of the grueling journey. It is a time of great celebration, where the Rudmen trade their prized furs for Cannorian and Halessi manufactured goods.\nThis unique and fascinating tradition is a testament to the Rudmen's resilience and resourcefulness. It is a practice that deserves our support and encouragement, for it not only helps to sustain their way of life but also contributes to the growth and development of the province."
    freemarches_varbuks_dream_title:0 "Varbuk's Dream"
    freemarches_varbuks_dream_desc:0 "The half-orcs have suffered more than any others. But despite our enslavement, despite the hatred and hostility from outsiders, despite being forced into this cursed forest because we had nowhere else to go— we have triumphed! We have prospered! No-one else could have built what we have built! Our founder dreamed of a nation "by half-orcs, for half-orcs", and now we shall ensure that our half-orcs are never threatened again!" #By TA31

    freemarches_ichor_of_the_forest_title:0 "Ichor of the Forest"
    freemarches_ichor_of_the_forest_desc:0 "A strange liquid has been found flowing from our trees, thought to be a disease or something magical at first some brave Rudmen have tasted it, finding it delicious and sweet they have begun to harvest trees specifically to find more of it. We should capitalize on this and start sponsoring foresters to harvest the ichor and begin to selling it abroad. This could be the start of a whole new industry!" #by Alcaz
    freemarches_reach_out_to_grombar_title:0 "Reach Out to Grombar"
    freemarches_reach_out_to_grombar_desc:0 "The nation of Grombar, back in Cannor, would be an excellent ally for us. They are tough, they are bold, they are fellow half-orcs and they know what it's like to be spat upon by those imperious southerners. We should send out diplomatic envoys and attempt to bring this natural alliance into being." #by TA31
    freemarches_the_gray_guard_title:0 "The Gray Guard"
    freemarches_the_gray_guard_desc:0 "For obvious reasons, our nation is a very popular destination for Grombari immigrants to Aelantir. The veterans and adventurers among them bring a wealth of information on modern military tactics. We should organize the skilled newcomers into a special military unit so that we can make full use of their valuable knowledge." #by TA31

    freemarches_temples_to_falah_title:0 "Temples to Falah"
    freemarches_temples_to_falah_desc:0 "Falah has clearly presented Herself as our patron deity. Typically Freemachers have tended to build small shrines or humble chapels to the gods. We must build great temples to Falah to show our reverence and devotion to her. "
    freemarches_murogafest_title:0 "Murogafest"
    freemarches_murogafest_desc:0 "Each year Freemarchers celebrate Murogafest, in honor of Muroga and her patron, Falah. The festival is a time for celebration, drinking, storytelling, and competition.\nThe festival provides an opportunity for people from different walks of life to come together and celebrate their shared heritage. Participants tell stories of Muroga's bravery and cunning, and some even claim to have seen the avatar herself.\nTowns and villages across the Freemarches are deck themselves out in bright banners and decoration. A day of drinking, merrymaking and storytelling ends with a great feast. Various forest delicacies are served, roast boar, elderberry scones with pinecone jam, goose stuffed with wild mushrooms.\nWe should encourage this festival and put the full weight of the state behind it. "
    freemarches_twelfth_pantheonic_council_title:0 "Twelfth Pantheonic Council"
    freemarches_twelfth_pantheonic_council_desc:0 "We should host a grand Pantheonic Council so that the temples of the Regent Court will recognize Muroga's divinity. We will invite priests from all across Cannor to Free Heart, and surely they will see the light of our arguments. \n[Converting to Ravelianism might provide an easier way to honour Muroga!]" #by TA31
    freemarches_saint_muroga_title:0 "Saint Muroga"
    freemarches_saint_muroga_desc:0 "The Ravelian Church, thankfully, has a somewhat more amenable view on canonization than certain other religions. In order to get Blessed Muroga recognized as a Ravelian saint, we need to both curry favor with the High Rectorate and gain the support of our brother nations in faith. After that we can send a formal delegation to the Rectorate's capital." #by TA31

    freemarches_our_forest_desc:0 "This forest is certainly not a loving or hospitable place. But we have prospered off its wealth, and if others cut in on the market, our economy would be threatened. The entire Forest of the Cursed Ones must be brought under Freemarcher control to secure our way of life." #by TA31
    freemarches_in_search_of_more_furs_title:0 "In Search of More Furs"
    freemarches_in_search_of_more_furs_desc:0 "Furs, furs, furs! Mink, giant beaver, logrkroz— they are our lifeblood, and half-orcs' strength makes us the best at securing them in these harsh lands. The coastal land of Themaria is a valuable hunting ground, and we are clearly more entitled to it than any feeble competitors!" #By TA31
    freemarches_best_served_cold_title:0 "Best Served Cold"
    freemarches_best_served_cold_desc:0 "The slave-hub of Dalaire is scum on the earth. It is where our ancestors were shoved ashore after being ripped from Cannor. Where they were bought and sold like cattle. And where the founders of the Freemarches escaped from so long ago. Now we are a strong nation, and yet they still grow rich on blood-soaked coin. We must end this cruelty and free our brothers. Dalaire will burn!" #By TA31
    freemarches_our_north_title:0 "Our North"
    freemarches_our_north_desc:0 "What are the Freemarches? A place of liberty, community, and honest work for honest living. What are the colonies around us? Wretches and parasites, plundering the land and pumping money to slavers— if not slavers themselves. Clearly, it is our rule that must extend over the entire North. One is either with us, or with the slavers." #By TA31

    flavor_freemarches.2.d:0 "Reports of an extraordinary, divine occurrence are coming in from Misty Fell. They tell of a Cursed One attack on an outlying village, all souls either slaughtered or fled. When the nearby garrison rallied to lead a counter attack, they witnessed a miracle. Muroga, the local priestess of Falah, emerged from the small village temple, a Cursed One spear through her heart and wielding the Falah's flaming bow.\n\nShe cried to the garrison "Falah has released me back onto this world to slay the wicked and hunt the hunters! Come boys, let us ensnare this foul game!"\n\nWith her flaming bow, she easily drove the Cursed Ones back into the forest. Before she gave chase, she stopped to give the captain of the garrison the spear that she pulled from her heart. The captain reportedly stood their agape for several minutes, as she disappeared into the forest.Turning to his men, he held the spear aloft, Muroga's heartsblood still dripping down it's shaft, and shouted "For the Freemarches! For Falah! For Muroga!"."

For it has been exactly 1 year since the Miracle of Muroga and since then there hasn't been a single Cursed One sighting, nevermind an attack. Freemarchers are not sure how to deal with the new status quo, whether now is the time for bold inroads into the Forest of the Cursed Ones, or if they will be left over extended and exposed if (or when) the Cursed Ones return.  For now, all Freemarchers are thanking the Gods for this reprieve. "

When they were not 300 yards from the tree line they saw their first glint of purple and silver as an Amethyst Knight cavalry formation came over the rise, lances lowered.\nThe call went out, 'Back to the trees!', but it was too late. The riders were upon them in a moment, lances whirling, blood splashing on their bright purple cloaks. Of the settlers, only a small fraction managed to make it back to the relative safety of the forest.\n\nTwo young half-orcs had managed to pull one of the riders from their mount and dragged him into the forest as captive. 'We defended the sacred river from all in this forest.' the young ruinborn managed to say, 'From all who would defile it.'.

Eyes a-glowin' in the dark and mouths snarlin' with hunger! But Tûka wasn't afraid, no sirree! With one mighty leap he jumped from his canoe to the shore, didn't even tip it over, and then he lifted that paddle and started a-whackin' those Cursed Ones! And every whack split one from tail to tip! Yessir, it was forty on one, but when Tûka was finished, all he left behind were forty broken Cursed Ones! And he went on down the river 'til he came to a strange cabin..." #by TA31
