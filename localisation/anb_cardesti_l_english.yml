 cardesti_events.5.t:0 "Arrival of The Cardesti"
 cardesti_events.5.d:0 "The nomadic Cardesti people, famous for their divination abilities, craftsmanship and bardic traditions, hail from the distant green riverlands of Rahen, near the mighty river Kharunyana. These folks have a long history of traveling across the world and having nowhere to call home, but that has not always been the case.\n\nHaving escaped the onslaught brought by Harimar's conquests, the Cardesti journeyed west throughout Bulwar to reach the Castanorian Dominion of Dostanor. Welcomed to settle in those lands, the Cardesti soon developed their communities and crafts, only to be on the run again after they were blamed for bringing about Daravan's Folly and misguiding the half-Cardesti King Daravan.\n\nLiving a nomadic life for many years, the Cardesti yet again found a chance to settle in a land they could call their own under the rule of the powerful seer Dunicha, who saw them colonize the Forlorn Vale. Originally a  favorite among the Castanorian Elite, Dunicha the "Augur Queen" led the state of Great Cardest  to prominence across the Borders and Dostanor, but was abandoned by her allies with the rise of Castan Ebonfrost, who invaded the Cardesti lands.  Betrayed by some of her own people,  who cut a deal to escape the war and return to their nomadic wanderings,  the Augur Queen cursed both the forests of her home and the descendants of her perfidious kin with her last breath, saying;\n\n"You and your blood will forever be trapped in mine lands, and no Man from the Beyond will ever call mine lands home. And to mine blood Beyond, an eternal and malevolent curse. You were offered a place to grow your roots yet you have fled back to the wilds. And flee you shall, for any of mine blood that dares to grow roots shall wither and die within a fortnight."\n\nThe Queen’s Curse poisoned the land and her people - the forlorn vale was uninhabitable until the elves of Ibevar proved immune to the curse that had prevented the Castanorians from resettling Great Cardest. The Cardesti, meanwhile, were doomed to wander forever, unable to stay in one place for more than two weeks, lest they wither and die a torturous death. So they travel, forced into moving, cursed and rarely trusted by the settled folk of Cannor, pining for a home but ever on the road."
 cardesti_events.5.a:0 "We shall see how they fare."

 cardesti_events.6.t:0 "The Cardesti Host"
 cardesti_events.6.d:0 "A large group of Cardesti nomads have crossed the borders and entered our domain. These people are an odd bunch; having mastered the magical art of divination, their fortune-tellers are quite popular with those who can afford their services. Moreover, as a group of experienced travelers, they have picked up some unique artisanry techniques and their bards are highly praised. However, the stark contrast between the customs in [Root.GetName] and the Cardestis’ might prove troublesome in the future…"
 cardesti_events.6.a:0 "Leave them to their business, for now…"
 cardesti_events.6.b:0 "Let them be, and have my advisors handle future migrations."

 cardesti_events.7.t:0 "The Cardesti Fortuneteller"
 cardesti_events.7.d:0 "A member of the migrant Cardesti community currently settled in [Root.GetName] has gained notoriety for successive accurate predictions of future events, foreseeing important events such as upcoming rainstorms, and monster attacks - and even smaller, more personal things like whether a newlywed couple is going to have a son or a daughter. Using a combination of magical talent and millennia of experience passed down by their predecessors, the Cardesti are quite renowned in the field of divination. Perhaps the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] has some questions they would like answered?"
 cardesti_events.7.a:0 "Superstitious nonsense!"
 cardesti_events.7.b:0 "Let us see what the future holds!"
 cardesti_events.7.c:0 "Let us see if our visions align!"
 cardesti_events.7.1:0 "So you're telling me the previous team will defend their championship title?"
 cardesti_events.7.e:0 "This is a great learning opportunity!"
 cardesti_events.7.f:0 "Is there a special someone in my future?"
 cardesti_events.7.g:0 "Do I need to increase my personal guard?"
 cardesti_random_advisor_tt:0 "Gain a skill §Y1§! advisor, of §Y[Root.Culture.GetName]§! heritage, following §Y[Root.Religion.GetName]§! in [Root.Country.GetName]. This advisor is §G25%§! cheaper for your country to employ."

 cardesti_events.8.t:0 "Cardesti Artisans Outperform Local Guilds"
 cardesti_events.8.d:0 "Having picked up knowledge from various foreign masters during their travels, Cardesti smiths are very competent and innovative when it comes to creating high-quality crafts and trinkets. Recently, a representative of the smiths' guild in [Root.GetName] has approached the court with a complaint regarding the local Cardesti smiths who have settled in a small encampment outside their town. The guild messenger claims that the Cardesti are stealing their customers away and upsetting local prices set by the guild. They demand we take immediate action and punish their 'illegal' practices."
 cardesti_events.8.a:0 "We should protect the local economy."
 cardesti_events.8.b:0 "Why don't you learn a thing or two from the Cardesti?"
 cardesti_events.8.c:0 "We should send some talented craftsmen to study Cardesti techniques!"
 cardesti_events.8.1:0 "Work together or else you both pay double taxes!"
 cardesti_events.8.e:0 "Use this opportunity to acquire the local businesses."

 cardesti_events.9.t:0 "The Cardesti Seek Protection"
 cardesti_events.9.d:0 "A horrified nomad has requested an urgent audience with the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]! He claims that their elder, a powerful diviner, has predicted an outraged local mob attacking their camp in the near future. The messenger is on his knees begging for a few soldiers to protect their camp and hold off this atrocity. However, a watching advisor whispers in [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]’s ear that should we do this, we risk alienating the local populace by providing special treatment to the foreigner Cardesti."
 cardesti_events.9.a:0 "Send some spare soldiers their way!"
 cardesti_events.9.b:0 "Our soldiers are needed elsewhere…"
 cardesti_events.9.c:0 "Send a warning to the local governor and have him disband the mob!"
 cardesti_events.9.1:0 "Send out a squad to arrest the possible conspirators!"

 cardesti_events.10.t:0 "Folktale And Superstition"
 cardesti_events.10.d:0 "The illiterate peasantry is known for their superstitious nonsense, and it looks like this time, the Cardesti are at the forefront of peasant suspicion in [Root.GetName]. The locals are accusing the Cardesti of using forbidden magic to alter the future and bring misfortune upon the province. The local governor has sent us a letter, warning the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] that a continued presence of the Cardesti could lead to further upheaval and unrest."
 cardesti_events.10.a:0 "Are you a fool? They're merely celebrating a holiday."
 cardesti_events.10.b:0 "Better safe than sorry, ask them to leave."
 cardesti_events.10.c:0 "Reassure the locals that the Cardesti are harmless."

 cardesti_events.11.t:0 "Cardesti Bards"
 cardesti_events.11.d:0 "Having been to practically all civilized parts of Cannor, the Cardesti have developed a strong bardic tradition. Some of their highly praised songs cover topics such as love, fate, and their numerous journeys. A group of Cadesti bards recently gained renown after impressive performances in some of [Root.GetName]'s busiest taverns -- their songs are apparently mesmerizing to the extent that some of our court members have voiced interest in having them perform for the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. The bards were fast to show their readiness, provided we pay them accordingly."
 cardesti_events.11.a:0 "This should be entertaining!"
 cardesti_events.11.b:0 "The economy, fools!"
 cardesti_events.11.c:0 "Let us invite the estates and have a grand performance!"
 cardesti_events.11.1:0 "Why not sponsor them and profit from their tunes?"
 cardesti_events.11.e:0 "Have them make an epic song to our greatness!"
 cardesti_events.11.f:0 "I've heard this before…"

 cardesti_events.12.t:0 "The Night of Fire Is Nigh"
 cardesti_events.12.d:0 "A powerful Cardesti diviner has sent us a message, warning the court of a devastating fire to descend upon [Root.GetName]. The Cardesti claim that it is impossible to know when exactly this event will unfold, but they are certain that the fire is going to happen and destroy some important buildings in the town. How seriously should we take this warning?"
 cardesti_events.12.a:0 "Be on the lookout for alarms and evacuate the buildings as soon as possible."
 cardesti_events.12.b:0 "Use superior materials and try to make the buildings more resilient to fire."
 cardesti_events.12.c:0 "Warn the occupants."
 cardesti_events.12.1:0 "This is vague and just an attention grab, ignore it."
 cardesti_events.12.e:0 "Contract the local mages guild to ward the area."
 cardesti_events.12.f:0 "Contract the local artificers guild to ward the area."

 cardesti_events.13.t:0 "The Night of Fire!"
 cardesti_events.13.d:0 "The fire is here! A massive cloud of smoke now overshadows [Root.GetName], it appears that some important structures in the city have been affected and the surrounding residential areas are in danger as well. The Cardesti diviner warned us about this!"
 cardesti_events.13.a:0 "Ashen skies!"

 cardesti_events.14.t:0 "Cardesti Criminal Apprehended"
 cardesti_events.14.d:0 "The Augur Queen's curse, often referred to as the curse of the Cardesti, is famous across Cannor: after a set period of time, the Cardesti must leave their encampment and move on, settling anew somewhere else, before they once more move on from there as well. . If not practiced on time and regularly, the curse is invoked and consumes the life of its subjects - the poor Cardesti who failed to continue their wandering.\n\nToday, a special criminal case has come to our attention: a member of the Cardesti community has been caught committing a petty crime. Normally, a few months in jail would teach these kinds of criminals the error of their ways, but in this case, the jail sentence is effectively a death sentence, and our jurists are debating whether to uphold the letter of the law or issue a special edict."
 cardesti_events.14.a:0 "Uphold the letter of the law."
 cardesti_events.14.b:0 "Grant the Cardesti a special pardon."
 cardesti_events.14.c:0 "Have the criminal regularly transferred between prisons."
 cardesti_events.14.1:0 "The Cardesti must provide monetary compensation."

 cardesti_events.15.t:0 "Prison Break"
 cardesti_events.15.d:0 "The Cardesti prisoner has managed to escape our custody and flee from the province. The Warden reports that the other Cardesti are the main culprits behind this event. The recent prison break will undoubtedly embolden the other inmates and criminals."
 cardesti_events.15.a:0 "But how…?"

 cardesti_events.16.t:0 "The Withering"
 cardesti_events.16.d:0 "It was a long night, longer than usual. At first the new inmate wouldn’t shut up, no matter what me and my fellows did. The Cardesti bastard would scream and beg us for freedom, for his life - and, well, we thought naught of it at first -just a root getting used to the rot, as they do. After some time, at least a few hours I reckon, the screaming stopped, and I thought ’Well that new inmate had enough of it and fell asleep, good for him’, so I let my eyes close down for a few minutes. Next thing I knew, there was screaming again. I got up to look but this time it wasn’t that Cardesti. I could tell it was my pal patrolling the dungeon, so rushed to see what in the name of all hells could be going on, since he never spooked easy none. I found him flat on his ass, pointing at the prison cell with the new bloke, arm shaking, trying to say something but only making chattering sounds. So I grabbed my cudgel and went closer to look … and what I saw… the Cardesti… the traveler was rotting. Same lad was alive and whole just a few hours back, but now he was a bloated corpse, looked like gangrene, more foul than the fires of hell. His jaw was off, his throat out. sorry for the graphic description, but its still with me. His mouth and throat had fallen off. I reckon that’s why the screaming stopped. Ain’t never seen anything like it - something had rotted away at the poor bastard’s body and soul, decaying him… I still see it when I close my eyes. I took the body out, we buried it. Poor bastard. At least now he’s got a final resting place."\n\n - From the journal of the Prison Warden of [Root.Province.GetName] following the Cardesti Incident of [GetYear]"
 cardesti_events.16.a:0 "Rest in peace."

 cardesti_events.17.t:0 "Cardesti Volunteers"
 cardesti_events.17.d:0 "A group of able-bodied Cardesti volunteers have offered to join the army. Our current logistics are not adequate for the constant relocation necessary to accommodate their 'special situation' -- the Cardesti curse which dictates that its subjects must relocate often in order to avoid their life being drained to nothing."
 cardesti_events.17.a:0 "Arrange periodic transfers between garrisons."
 cardesti_events.17.b:0 "Tell them we appreciate the gesture and refuse."
 cardesti_events.17.c:0 "An excellent opportunity to introduce new terrain drills!"

 cardesti_events.18.t:0 "A Flickering Candle"
 cardesti_events.18.d:0 "Love is a flame. At times it is warm and comforting - at others, violent and destructive. It can be contained, bottled up, or allowed to grow until it is all-consuming.\n\nThe comparison of love and fire is not a new concept, but the poetry of the Cardesti has a particular penchant for comparing the two. A Cardesti love ballad without at least some mention of kindling, ashes, furnaces, or some other blazing metaphor is barely a ballad at all, at least among more traditionally-minded bards.\n\nWere one of those bards to write a song of the events of recent days, the metaphor of choice would be a flickering candle. A small flame, upon a small candle, upon a table coated in finery, under threat of smothering at any moment. A [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] noble, desperately in love with a Cardesti youth. A requited love, despite the two knowing each other for barely a week.\n\nLike all good love stories, it is not one without drama - the Cardesti, through no fault of their own cursed to ever wander; and the [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] noble, willing to give up their inheritance to follow. And that noble lover’s family, who refuse to see their family name sullied, their inheritance muddied, their scion abandon them.\n\nThis sputtering candle of love finds itself in [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s hands, the lovers petitioning for their sovereign's blessing. How is it that this ballad shall end?"
 cardesti_events.18.a:0 "A tragic tale, a love denied."
 cardesti_events.18.b:0 "A bittersweet tale, a love apart."
 cardesti_events.18.c:0 "A moral tale, a love austere."
 cardesti_events.18.1:0 "A joyous tale, a love triumphant."

 cardesti_events.19.t:0 "A Burning Ballad"
 cardesti_events.19.d:0 "A tale I tell you now this night,\nof lovers bereft, their love denied;\na fiery passion, blazing hot,\nafflicted by tragedy nobility wrought.\n\nOne of them, they could not stay,\nnot of their own will, for if one more day\nthey would remain then cursed they be,\nby that which afflicts all Cardesti.\n\nThe other a noble, of [Root.Culture.GetName] make,\nwhose heart the Cardesti youth did take,\nand whom took of the youth their heart in turn,\nyet if to follow, by noble family spurned.\n\nTheir things in their trunk the noble packed,\nand prepared to leave upon horseback,\nyet told if this journey they were to undertake,\ntheir name and titles, they must forsake.\n\nBut upon the eve the Cardesti were to depart,\nthe noble appealed to their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s heart,\nand when presented with a love so true,\nwhat else is there for a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to do?\n\nAnd so upon the light of dawn,\nthe lovers rode out, no more forlorn,\na warm embrace, a hand in a hand,\nwith shared noble name, true heirs to their land!"
 cardesti_events.19.a:0 " Love burns bright in [Root.GetName]"

 cardesti_events.20.t:0 "Learning From A Traveler"
 cardesti_events.20.d:0 "A crowd of people in [Root.GetName] have been reported to gather near the local Cardesti encampment and listen to their stories and lectures. These Cardesti tell stories about their journeys, speak in foreign tongues, talk about new inventions in other parts of Cannor, and explain strange, foreign customs. Perhaps the tales they tell would interest our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] as well?"
 cardesti_events.20.a:0 "Invite them to court, let's see if they can share something useful!"
 cardesti_events.20.b:0 "Their lies spread heresy, defeatism, and desertion! Stop it at once!"
 cardesti_events.20.c:0 "Encourage such gatherings!"
 cardesti_events.20.1:0 "These 'new ideas' will bring new troubles."
 cardesti_events.20.e:0 "We should focus on more pressing matters."
