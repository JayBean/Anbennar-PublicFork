 cardesti_events.5.t:0 "Arrival of The Cardesti."
 cardesti_events.5.d:0 "The nomadic Cardesti people, famous for their divination abilities, craftsmanship and bardic traditions, hail from the distant green riverlands of Rahen, near the mighty river Kharunyana. These folks have a long history of traveling across the world and having nowhere to call home, but that has not always been the case.\n\nHaving escaped the onslaught brought by Harimar's conquests, the Cardesti journeyed west throughout Bulwar to reach the Catanorian Dominion of Dostanor, having been welcomed to settle in those lands, the Cardesti soon developed their communities and crafts, only to be on the run again after Daravan's Folly - the half-Cardesti Korbarid King who devastated his own lands in order to stop a massive gnolish invasion - the Cardesti were blamed for giving Daravan wrong predictions and eventually ousted by the local Korbarid.\n\nBeing a nomadic group traveling across Cannor, the Cardesti yet again found a chance to settle in a land they could call their own led by the young, powerful seer Dunicha in the Forlorn Vale, being a favorite among the Castanorian Elite, Dunicha would later be dubbed as the "Augur Queen" for her divination ability. The state of Great Cardest soon came to be, spanning the Forlorn Vale, The Borders and even Dostanor. But all good things came to an end when Castan Ebonfrost invaded the Cardesti capital, having been let in by several dissident Cardesti tribes who'd then choose to escape the war again and seek greener pastures, leading to the Augur Queen putting a curse on the invaders, and her own people;\n\n“You and your blood will forever be trapped in mine lands, and no Man from the Beyond will ever call mine lands home. And to mine blood Beyond, an eternal and malevolent curse. You were offered a place to grow your roots yet you have fled back to the wilds. And flee you shall, for any of mine blood that dares to grow roots shall wither and die within a fortnight”."
 cardesti_events.5.a:0 "We shall see how they fare."

 cardesti_events.6.t:0 "The Cardesti Host."
 cardesti_events.6.d:0 "A large group of Cardesti nomads have crossed the borders and entered our domain. These people are an odd bunch; having mastered the magical art of divination, their fortune-tellers are quite popular with those who can afford their services. Moreover, as a group of experienced travelers, they have picked up some unique artisanry techniques and their bards are highly praised. However, the stark contrast between the customs in [Root.GetName] and the Cardestis’ might prove troublesome in the future…"
 cardesti_events.6.a:0 "Leave them to their business, for now…"
 cardesti_events.6.b:0 "Let them be, and have my advisors handle future migrations."

 cardesti_events.7.t:0 "The Cardesti Fortuneteller."
 cardesti_events.7.d:0 "A member of the migrant Cardesti community currently settled in [Root.GetName] has gained notoriety for successive accurate predictions of future events, foreseeing important events such as upcoming rainstorms, and monster attacks - and even smaller, more personal things like whether a newlywed couple is going to have a son or a daughter. Using a combination of magical talent and millennia of experience passed down by their predecessors, the Cardesti are quite renowned in the field of divination. Perhaps the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] has some questions they would like answered?"
 cardesti_events.7.a:0 "Superstitious nonsense!"
 cardesti_events.7.b:0 "Let us see what the future holds!"
 cardesti_events.7.c:0 "Let us see if our visions align!"
 cardesti_events.7.1:0 "So you're telling me the previous team will defend their championship title?"
 cardesti_events.7.e:0 "This is a great learning opportunity!"
 cardesti_events.7.f:0 "Is there a special someone in my future?"
 cardesti_events.7.g:0 "Do I need to increase my personal guard?"

 cardesti_events.8.t:0 "Cardesti Artisans Outperform Local Guilds."
 cardesti_events.8.d:0 "Having picked up knowledge from various foreign masters during their travels, Cardesti smiths are very competent and innovative when it comes to creating high-quality crafts and trinkets. Recently, a representative of the smiths' guild in [Root.GetName] has approached the court with a complaint regarding the local Cardesti smiths who have settled in a small encampment outside their town. The guild messenger claims that the Cardesti are stealing their customers away and upsetting local prices set by the guild. They demand we take immediate action and punish their 'illegal' practices."
 cardesti_events.8.a:0 "We should protect the local economy."
 cardesti_events.8.b:0 "Why don't you learn a thing or two from the Cardesti?"
 cardesti_events.8.c:0 "We should send some talented craftsmen to study Cardesti techniques!"
 cardesti_events.8.1:0 "Work together or else you both pay double taxes!"
 cardesti_events.8.e:0 "Use this opportunity to acquire the local businesses."

 cardesti_events.9.t:0 "The Cardesti Seek Protection."
 cardesti_events.9.d:0 "A horrified nomad has requested an urgent audience with the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]! He claims that their elder, a powerful diviner, has predicted an outraged local mob attacking their camp in the near future. The messenger is on his knees begging for a few soldiers to protect their camp and hold off this atrocity. However, a watching advisor whispers in [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]’s ear that should we do this, we risk alienating the local populace by providing special treatment to the foreigner Cardesti."
 cardesti_events.9.a:0 "Send some spare soldiers their way!"
 cardesti_events.9.b:0 "Our soldiers are needed elsewhere…"
 cardesti_events.9.c:0 "Send a warning to the local governor and have him disband the mob!"
 cardesti_events.9.1:0 "Send out a squad to arrest the possible conspirators!"

 cardesti_events.10.t:0 "Folktale And Superstition."
 cardesti_events.10.d:0 "The illiterate peasantry is known for their superstitious nonsense, and it looks like this time, the Cardesti are at the forefront of peasant suspicion in [Root.GetName]. The locals are accusing the Cardesti of using forbidden magic to alter the future and bring misfortune upon the province. The local governor has sent us a letter, warning the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] that a continued presence of the Cardesti could lead to further upheaval and unrest."
 cardesti_events.10.a:0 "Are you a fool? They're merely celebrating a holiday."
 cardesti_events.10.b:0 "Better safe than sorry, ask them to leave."
 cardesti_events.10.c:0 "Reassure the locals that the Cardesti are harmless."

 cardesti_events.11.t:0 "Cardesti Bards."
 cardesti_events.11.d:0 "Having been to practically all civilized parts of Cannor, the Cardesti have developed a strong bardic tradition. Some of their highly praised songs cover topics such as love, fate, and their numerous journeys. A group of Cadesti bards recently gained renown after impressive performances in some of [Root.GetName]'s busiest taverns -- their songs are apparently mesmerizing to the extent that some of our court members have voiced interest in having them perform for the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. The bards were fast to show their readiness, provided we pay them accordingly."
 cardesti_events.11.a:0 "This should be entertaining!"
 cardesti_events.11.b:0 "The economy, fools!"
 cardesti_events.11.c:0 "Let us invite the estates and have a grand performance!"
 cardesti_events.11.1:0 "Why not sponsor them and profit from their tunes?"
 cardesti_events.11.e:0 "Have them make an epic song to our greatness!"
 cardesti_events.11.f:0 "I've heard this before…"

 cardesti_events.12.t:0 "The Night of Fire Is Nigh."
 cardesti_events.12.d:0 "A powerful Cardesti diviner has sent us a message, warning the court of a devastating fire to descend upon [Root.GetName]. The Cardesti claim that it is impossible to know when exactly this event will unfold, but they are certain that the fire is going to happen and destroy some important buildings in the town. How seriously should we take this warning?"
 cardesti_events.12.a:0 "Be on the lookout for alarms and evacuate the buildings as soon as possible."
 cardesti_events.12.b:0 "Use superior materials and try to make the buildings more resilient to fire."
 cardesti_events.12.c:0 "Warn the occupants."
 cardesti_events.12.1:0 "This is vague and just an attention grab, ignore it."
 cardesti_events.12.e:0 "Contract the local mages guild to ward the area."
 cardesti_events.12.f:0 "Contract the local artificers guild to ward the area."

 cardesti_events.13.t:0 "The Night of Fire!"
 cardesti_events.13.d:0 "The fire is here! A massive cloud of smoke now overshadows [Root.GetName], it appears that some important structures in the city have been affected and the surrounding residential areas are in danger as well. The Cardesti diviner warned us about this!"
 cardesti_events.13.a:0 "Ashen skies!"

 cardesti_events.14.t:0 "Cardesti Criminal Apprehended."
 cardesti_events.14.d:0 "The Augur Queen's curse, often referred to as the curse of the Cardesti, is famous across Cannor: after a set period of time, the Cardesti must leave their encampment and move on, settling anew somewhere else, before they once more move on from there as well. . If not practiced on time and regularly, the curse is invoked and consumes the life of its subjects - the poor Cardesti who failed to continue their wandering.\n\nToday, a special criminal case has come to our attention: a member of the Cardesti community has been caught committing a petty crime. Normally, a few months in jail would teach these kinds of criminals the error of their ways, but in this case, the jail sentence is effectively a death sentence, and our jurists are debating whether to uphold the letter of the law or issue a special edict."
 cardesti_events.14.a:0 "Uphold the letter of the law."
 cardesti_events.14.b:0 "Grant the Cardesti a special pardon."
 cardesti_events.14.c:0 "Have the criminal regularly transferred between prisons."
 cardesti_events.14.1:0 "The Cardesti must provide monetary compensation."

 cardesti_events.15.t:0 "Prison Break."
 cardesti_events.15.d:0 "The Cardesti prisoner has managed to escape our custody and flee from the province. The Warden reports that the other Cardesti are the main culprits behind this event. The recent prison break will undoubtedly embolden the other inmates and criminals."
 cardesti_events.15.a:0 "But how…?"

 cardesti_events.16.t:0 "The Withering."
 cardesti_events.16.d:0 "It was a long night, longer than usual, at first, the new inmate wouldn’t shut up, no matter what me and my fellows did the Cardesti would still scream and beg us for freedom, well we thought naught of it first, it was just a root getting used to the rot, as they do. After some times, at least few hours I reckon, the screaming stopped, I thought oh well that new inmate had enough of it and fell asleep, so I let my eyes close down for a few minutes before hearing a scream again, this time, it wasn’t of that new inmate, I could tell it was my pal whose turn it was to patrol the dungeon. I put the larger into the smaller and rushed to see what in the name of all hells is going on, what I saw was the stuff of nightmares; my pal was laying on his bum pointing at the prison cell that the newcomer was staying in, arm thoroughly shaking, so I went closer to check it out… what I saw… the Cardesti… the Cardesti was rotting, like a gangrenous wound, but this was no wound, this was much more foul than the fires of hell. The inmate’s mouth and throat had fallen off, I reckon that’s why the screaming stopped a while ago, something was slowly rotting away at the poor bastard’s body and soul, decaying whatever was remaining inside and out, and the stench was worse than that of ten dead cows combined… the inmate was… dead… I thought, before mustering all the courage I could and burying the corpse outside.\n\nsigned, The Prison Warden"
 cardesti_events.16.a:0 "Rest in peace, you can stay here now, free of your curse."

 cardesti_events.17.t:0 "Cardesti Volunteers."
 cardesti_events.17.d:0 "A group of able-bodied Cardesti volunteers have offered to join the army. Our current logistics are not adequate for the constant relocation necessary to accommodate their 'special situation' -- the Cardesti curse which dictates that its subjects must relocate often in order to avoid their life being drained to nothing."
 cardesti_events.17.a:0 "Arrange periodic transfers between garrisons."
 cardesti_events.17.b:0 "Tell them we appreciate the gesture and refuse."
 cardesti_events.17.c:0 "An excellent opportunity to introduce new terrain drills!"

 cardesti_events.20.t:0 "Learning From A Traveler."
 cardesti_events.20.d:0 "A crowd of people in [Root.GetName] have been reported to gather near the local Cardesti encampment and listen to their stories and lectures. These Cardesti tell stories about their journeys, speak in foreign tongues, talk about new inventions in other parts of Cannor, and explain strange, foreign customs. Perhaps the tales they tell would interest our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] as well?"
 cardesti_events.20.a:0 "Invite them to court, let's see if they can share something useful!"
 cardesti_events.20.b:0 "Their lies spread heresy, defeatism, and desertion! Stop it at once!"
 cardesti_events.20.c:0 "Encourage such gatherings!"
 cardesti_events.20.1:0 "These 'new ideas' will bring new troubles."
 cardesti_events.20.e:0 "We should focus on more pressing matters."
