#I am Gilly, the Lead of Righteousness, whom Surael has endowed with wisdom, am I. My words are weighty; my deeds are unrivalled.
#Heed my words. Do not corrupt this sacred list; do not alter its content.
#If you pay attention to my words which I have written upon this file, do not efface my judgments, do not overrule my words, and do not alter this list, then will Surael bless you with his Light.
#But if you do not pay attention to my word which I have written upon this file; if you forget my curse and do not fear the curse of Surael; if you abolish the judgments which I have formulated, 
#overrule my words, alter this list- for you, be developer or Lead, or tester or player; whoever you may be, may the great god, the Lord of Light, who has ordained my Leadership, curse your fate!
#May your heirs die in hunting accidents; may comets visit your night sky every month; may your inflation never lower from 600%; may your ruler die and your country becomes a junior partner in a personal union;
#May your permanent buffs run out; may you lose the cores in your land; may your armies abandon you and may you lose your country to rebels.
