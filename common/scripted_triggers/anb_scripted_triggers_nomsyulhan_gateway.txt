### For System Questions Ask @Balgar's Apprentice

## IMPORTANT ##
# When adding a new expedition:
#	be sure to include its flags in the nomsyulhan_gateway_effects.txt file
#	be sure to include its flags in the scripted trigger below marked "### EXPEDITIONS ###"
# Each expedition's flag should follow this pattern: 
#	DESCRIPTOR_expedition 				(this flag gives access to the expedition)
#	DESCRIPTOR_expedition_complete		(this flag marks an expedition as successfully completed)
# For Example:
#	tutorial_agradent_expedition
#	tutorial_agradent_expedition_complete


has_nomsyulhan_gateway_keystone = {
	### EXPEDITIONS ###
	OR = {
		has_country_flag = tutorial_agradent_expedition

		has_country_flag = test1_expedition

		has_country_flag = test2_expedition

		has_country_flag = test3_expedition
	}
